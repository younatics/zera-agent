"Former UKIP candidate Ian Couch has been spared jail after being found guilty of sending offensive messages to a mosque . A former UKIP candidate who sent an offensive email to a mosque after Islamic State extremists beheaded a journalist has been spared jail, . Ian Couch, 54, sent the messages in a drunken rage after becoming angry at TV reports of the beheading of US journalist James Foley. Couch, a former counter terrorism operative, also posted racial slurs on Facebook alongside a picture of a pig's head he kept in his fridge. The pig's head was then found in Couch's fridge after police officers visited the former marine's home in Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire, in August last year. He had denied two counts of sending offensive messages and claimed he had a right to freedom of expression. He was found guilty by magistrates and was told to expect a jail sentence. In his sentencing hearing this week, Cambridge Magistrates' Court heard how Couch was arrested after he sent a menacing and intimidating email to the Omar Faruque mosque in Cambridge. The email was sent after Couch, who admitted he was drunk at the time, watched a news segment on US journalist James Foley's beheading by Islamist extremists. Defending James Dignan told the court that Couch was in fact a 'vulnerable' individual who operated under a 'facade of humour and jocularity' to hide his problems with alcohol and depression. US journalist James Foley, pictured, was beheaded by Islamic State extremists in August last year . He said: 'When he was convicted he got out his sleeping bag and went to bed and remained there for three days, he was do devastated and traumatised. 'I don't believe that Mr Couch appreciated the seriousness of these offences at the time but he is now aware.' He added: 'This is a man who served his country in the armed forces for some years. 'He's seen many of his friends and comrades killed or maimed and that has had a very profound affect. 'When he sees people being killed like Mr Foley it probably does affect him more than most.' Deputy district Judge Shanta Deonarine said she accepted Couch had shown remorse and handed him a 12-week jail sentence, suspended for a year. She said: 'I agree hatred underlined the offences. I feel this was an offence against the community as a whole. 'What you did had a wider impact, not just on the people you sent them to, and might have caused more violence and hatred.' He was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £80, £420 towards the prosecution costs, and he he must complete an alcohol treatment plan. Couch stood as a UKIP candidate in last May's South Cambridgeshire District Council's elections. He is no longer a member of the party after they asked him to leave upon discovering his anti-Islamic views. Couch also posted racial slurs on Facebook alongside a picture of a pig's head he kept in his fridge .

"Ed Miliband’s hopes of winning the General Election were fading last night after his leadership came under heavy fire from his own party. The embattled Labour leader faced a new crisis as the party’s biggest private donor joined the withering attacks on his NHS policies. And Mr Miliband was described as looking ‘haunted’ because he knew that his party was on course to lose the Election, according to the editor of Britain’s leading Labour-supporting magazine. Scroll down for video . Missing the point: Ed Miliband’s speech on the NHS last week failed to stop Labour’s electoral rot . The twin blows came as Labour MPs privately admitted they feared Miliband’s Election campaign was in danger of collapsing. His credibility was further eroded as it was revealed that: . The new pressure on Miliband over his controversial vow to reverse Coalition NHS reforms came from millionaire businessman John Mills, the brother-in-law of former Minister Tessa Jowell. Mr Mills backed the attack on the policy made by former Labour Cabinet Minister Alan Milburn last week, exposing rifts within the party. The tycoon said Labour was wrong to decry the increasing involvement of the private sector in the NHS, adding: ‘I agree with Milburn – if you look at the Continental model, they have a much greater mix of public and private provision.’ Mr Mills, the chairman of consumer goods giant JML, gave Labour £1.65million in 2013. He also condemned Mr Miliband’s plan to use a mansion tax to provide much of the extra £2.5billion a year he plans to inject into the NHS. ‘I am not convinced of the case for a tax on expensive properties,’ he told The Mail on Sunday. ‘And it certainly should not be hypothecated for the NHS. It would be much better to introduce extra council tax bands and spend the money on local needs, such as affordable housing.’ Miliband faced another devastating critique from Jason Cowley, editor of the Left-leaning New Statesman magazine, who said Labour knew it was heading for defeat in May – but had no idea how to stop the rot. Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, Mr Cowley says Miliband is at war with his campaign chief Douglas Alexander, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has ‘all but given up’ on the party leader, and Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham is busy promoting his own leadership ambitions. The mood of Labour MPs is ‘not so much one of despair, it’s worse than that – resignation,’ says Mr Cowley. Labour appeared to be ‘willing itself to defeat. The party knows it is losing an Election that it should be winning, and doesn’t know what to do about it.’ Mr Cowley says ‘haunted’ Miliband has ‘grown distrustful of colleagues’ adding: ‘There are splits over strategy between Miliband and Alexander, and between Miliband and Balls. Balls has “all but given up on Miliband,” I was told by a friend of the Shadow Chancellor.’ Mr Cowley says Miliband is ‘decent and intelligent’ and could yet scrape home with more seats than the Tories – though not achieve an overall majority – but only thanks to Britain’s voting system which favours Labour. A measure of the anxiety in Miliband’s inner circle is the claim that they have already discussed how to prop up his leadership in the event of defeat on polling day, in a series of so-called ‘war gaming’ sessions. ‘A group of Ed’s advisers have talked through what to do if they wake up on May 8 and Cameron is still PM,’ said an insider. ‘They know Ed’s Shadow Cabinet enemies are waiting to strike and their plan is to buy time by arguing that Cameron will be in a very weak position if he fails to win an outright majority. Ed’s people will say that Cameron may be unable to form a new Coalition and there could be a second Election very soon. ‘If that happens, they will say that Labour needs stability, not a divisive leadership contest lasting months, and that Ed would provide that stability.’ Ed Miliband’s hopes of winning the General Election were fading last night after his leadership came under heavy fire from his own party . Further signs of Miliband’s embattled position emerged from reports of an Election ‘pep talk’ he delivered to Shadow Ministers. According to one witness, he said: ‘I know they will be coming for me and I am ready for it. Even the liberal BBC appears to be losing the faith. First, on Tuesday’s Newsnight, Kirsty Wark skewered Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham over his NHS policy. Then on yesterday’s Today programme on Radio 4, James Naughtie, who once used the term ‘we’ on air to describe Labour, repeatedly likened Mr Miliband’s efforts to the party’s doomed 1992 campaign during a challenging interview with Roy Hattersley. ’Some thought he was referring to growing attacks on him by former Ministers such as Milburn, who served in Tony Blair’s Government and backed David Miliband in the 2010 Labour leadership contest. A source close to Miliband said: ‘He is very angry at the number of Labour politicians who are prepared to criticise him publicly.’ One senior Labour MP pointed the finger of blame at Lord Mandelson, who enraged Miliband by criticising the mansion tax. ‘The sniping against Ed [Miliband] has all the hallmarks of a Mandy campaign,’ said the MP. ‘Ed despises him for what he said on the mansion tax. Mandelson cannot get over the fact that Ed has turned his back on his precious New Labour project.’ Friends of Mandelson said it was ‘nonsense’ to suggest he was behind a campaign to undermine Miliband. One MP, a long-standing ally of Miliband, said: ‘You sometimes wonder whether these Blairites actually want us to win the Election. Maybe they would rather Ed loses so they can say “We told you so” and replace him with another Blairite.’ Ed Miliband became a laughing stock when his clumsy attempts to eat a bacon butty slavered in ketchup were captured on camera. And it appears that his Shadow Chancellor isn’t quite prepared to forget the embarrassing incident. Yesterday Ed Balls tweeted the ‘bliss’ of finding a ‘cafe which does proper bacon sandwiches’ after two hours of canvassing Yorkshire. His post triggered a tsunami of sarcastic comments, including, ‘Can you eat it without looking like an alien????’ and ‘You aren’t giving the other Ed lessons in eating a bacon sandwich are you?’ In the end, Mr Balls joined in, pointedly revealing he had ordered ‘bacon on a big bap, no sauce…’","Ed Miliband's leadership comes under heavy fire from his own party .

"A South Carolina couple facing murder charges for allegedly killing the husband's former 20-year-old mistress were each granted a $100,000 bond Friday after spending nearly a year in jail. Tammy Moorer, 42, and her husband, 38-year-old Sidney Moorer, are accused of killing Heather Elvis, even though her body has never been found after her disappearance in December 2013. The Moorers’ defense attorneys asked for another hearing because they said their investigation showed prosecutors didn't have as much evidence as they initially claimed. Scroll down for video . Bonded out: Tammy Moorer (left), 42, and her husband, 38-year-old Sidney Moorer (right), were each granted a $100,000 bond after spending nearly a year in jail on murder charges in the killing of Heather Elvis . Mystery: Heather Elvis (left and right), 20, went missing in December 2013. Her body has never been found . Circuit Judge Markley Dennis decided to grant bond after stating that under the law they were innocent. The judge also required the couple to wear GPS monitors and ordered them to stay at least 5 miles away from the home of the victim's parents. Both the suspects' families and the victims' families reported they have been repeatedly harassed and threatened on Facebook. Tammy and Sidney Moorer are currently scheduled to stand trial in May. The couple were transported back to jail after the bond hearing. Mrs Moorer had posted bond by Friday afternoon and was videotaped by WMBF leaving the detention facility at around 6pm. Her husband remained behind bars because the paperwork required for his release had not been filed, according to ABC News 4. A gag order has been issued in the case, leading to plenty of speculation, but not much information. Attorneys for the Moorers used the bond hearing to publicly attack the prosecution's case. Get out of jail free: Mrs Moorer had posted bond by Friday afternoon and was videotaped leaving the detention facility at around 6pm . Love triangle: Sidney Moorer had an affair with Heather Elvis before she vanished in December 2013 . The defense lawyers said authorities immediately locked on Sidney Moorer as a suspect because he had an affair with Elvis about two months before she went missing in December 2013. Moorer also called Elvis from a pay phone about two hours before she disappeared, but his lawyer, Kirk Truslow, said it was simply to tell Elvis to stop bothering him after she kept calling and texting when he ended their brief relationship and reconciled with his wife. Truslow said the only other evidence was a black truck seen on a surveillance camera driving to and from the boat ramp where Elvis' car was found around the time she disappeared. The Moorers owned a black truck, but so do hundreds of other people in the area, and Truslow said prosecutors had no expert that could link the truck directly to them. Prosecutor Nancy Livesay told the judge that authorities have substantial circumstantial evidence, including threats Tammy Moorer made on a Facebook page trying to get help finding Elvis after she disappeared and a number of nasty text messages she sent to Elvis. Sidney and Tammy Moorer have been charged with obstructing justice and indecent exposure . Living in fear: Heather's parents reported they have been repeatedly harassed and threatened . Tammy Moorer's lawyer also criticized the investigation, saying authorities took Sidney Moorer's mention that he and his wife had sex in a car behind a warehouse to charge them with indecent exposure so police could get warrants to search everything they owned. ‘The arrest of them was designed to solve the case,’ defense attorney Greg McCollum said. ‘And if they had committed the crime, it might very well have worked.’ Heather Elvis's parents, Debbi and Terry Elvis, were present at the Charleston courtroom during the bond hearing Friday. After hearing the judge’s decision, the parents said they were concerned for the safety of their younger daughter and appealed to the community to respect the authority of the court. Earlier this week, Heather's dad said he was frustrated that the focus was on the suspects' bond hearing rather than on locating his missing daughter. ‘It's like being in limbo, you can't grieve,’ his wife added in an interview with WMBF. ‘Heather's not here, so you can grieve that...there's no place to go.’ Heather Elvis, a cosmetology student, vanished on December 18 after she drove her car - willingly, authorities believe - to a boat landing building in Myrtle Beach. It was found empty on December 19. Cell phone records show Sidney Moorer, 38, was in contact with Miss Elvis at 6am on the day she disappeared. Looking for Heather: Elvis drove to Peachtree Landing, pictured, on December 18 and her empty car was found there the next day. Authorities have not found her body but said they believe she has been murdered . In the original police report, seen by WMBF News, Miss Elvis was said to have been in a relationship with Moorer, who she had met while working in a restaurant. Her roommate had told police the affair had ended about a month before Miss Elvis disappeared, and that on the night she went missing, the pair were back in contact. The roommate allegedly said Miss Elvis told her Moorer had called to say he was leaving his wife so he could be with her. A December 19 police report included a statement from Sidney Moorer admitting he had been in contact with Miss Elvis, to tell her to 'quit calling him and that was it'. On the night Miss Elvis disappeared, she had been on a date with a man who dropped her off at the apartment at about 2am. That man has been ruled out of the investigation. Police believe Miss Elvis later drove herself to the boat landing where her car was found, although the reason she would go there is not known.","Heather Elvis, 20, went missing in South Carolina in December 2013.

"A new £90 million emergency-only hospital hailed as ‘a glimpse of the future’ by the most senior doctor in the NHS will lead to three other A&E units being effectively downgraded, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. After NHS England medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh visited the site of the Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital last February, he praised it as an example for others to follow. Local NHS bosses say it ‘aligns’ with Sir Bruce’s controversial plan to develop a two-tier emergency network across England – a move critics claim will jeopardise A&Es, meaning longer journeys for patients. Local NHS bosses have accused Sir Bruce of trying to create a 'two tier' emergency response system which critics say will mean longer journeys for patients . When unveiling his national plan in November 2013, Sir Bruce said it was ‘complete nonsense’ to suggest some A&Es would be downgraded as a result of the drive to develop larger specialist units. But the opening in June of a new 210-bed facility in Cramlington, ten miles north of Newcastle, will trigger the loss of ‘blue-light’ emergency services at three district general hospitals elsewhere in Northumberland. Officials insist Hexham, Wansbeck and North Tyneside hospitals will maintain ‘walk-in A&E services’. Yet the three units will only be staffed and equipped to cope with incidents typically dealt with by lower-ranking urgent care centres, according to a leading doctor. Dr John O’Donohue, who fought to keep a Casualty department at London’s Lewisham Hospital said: ‘I think it’s misleading to say they will still be A&Es. It’s stretching the common interpretation of A&E to breaking point.’ The consultant physician claimed Northumberland was a harbinger of what would happen under the Keogh plan. 'There’s a danger the centralisation argument is being used as a juggernaut to halve the number of district general hospital A&Es in England,’ he claimed. For more than two years, The Mail on Sunday has been campaigning against A&E closures, which can leave patients having to travel further. Local campaigners say NHS bosses should come clean and admit the A&Es are being downgraded. Gail Ward, 57, an angina sufferer from Haltwhistle, Northumberland, who has been treated more than a dozen times for serious problems at Hexham Hospital, said last night: ‘Once these changes go through, it won’t have a proper A&E.’ While hospitals such as Wrexham, which are close to Cramlington, will still technically have A&E departments, they will be staffed and equipped like lesser ranking urgent treatment centres . Dr John O’Donohue said calling the units at hospitals such as North Tyneside A&Es was 'stretching the common interpretation of A&E to breaking point' The three ‘walk-in A&Es’ will treat ‘minor head, ear or eye problems, broken noses and nose bleeds, sprains and strains, cuts and bites, minor children’s injuries and ailments, minor breaks and abscesses and wounds’, said a spokeswoman for Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. They will no longer take ‘blue-light’ ambulances – meaning patients with heart and lung problems, strokes, other serious afflictions suffered mainly by the elderly, or those with life-threatening injuries will be taken straight to Cramlington. Neither will the district generals carry out emergency surgery. As a result, Wansbeck and North Tyneside A&Es – which each see more than 60,000 patients a year – will lose half their patients. Hexham, which lost trauma and emergency surgery in 2005, will see around 4,000 of its 17,000 A&E patients go. Northumbria medical director David Evans said senior A&E doctors and specialist nurses from the three hospitals would be ‘pooled’ to work at the new site. But speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Mr Evans sidestepped questions about whether the changes amounted to downgrading of the three existing A&Es. Wansbeck hospital will see up to half of its patients go under plans to downsize the A&E department . He said: ‘We are relocating medical cover into one central location. We are still providing emergency care centres at our existing hospitals, which will be staffed by nurses and doctors 24 hours a day.’ He said he was awaiting guidance from NHS England about what units offering ‘walk-in A&E services’ should be called. The Trust has committed to having an A&E consultant at the units between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. There will always be a doctor plus nurses on site at nights and weekends, said the spokeswoman. But Miss Ward, who has helped lead an online petition signed by 1,700 people to safeguard Hexham’s emergency services, said: ‘We are concerned about patient safety.’ Some elderly people who are without a car would be 50 miles from Cramlington, she said. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘While NHS England sets out the ambitions for the future of Urgent and Emergency care, it is for local GP-led commissioning groups to decide what is best for their own areas.’ Sir Bruce Keogh said trusts needed to be clear about what each emergency unit could do, adding: ‘Not all A&E units are currently equal – they don’t all offer the same level or quality of service. ‘Unless we are transparent it is impossible to have the constructive local debates we need.’ PM's brother-in-law: A&E is in crisis . By Brendan Carlin . Cardiologist Carl Brookes, who is married to the Prime Minister’s sister Tania, warned of an 'unprecedented' demand on the NHS . David Cameron faced embarrassment over the NHS crisis last night after his doctor brother-in-law warned of ‘unprecedented’ pressure on the health service. Cardiologist Carl Brookes, who is married to the Prime Minister’s sister Tania, spoke of the ‘extraordinary’ challenges faced by his own hospital trust in Hampshire over the past few weeks. It also emerged that the trust, which is made up of three hospitals, is so stretched that it has asked IT workers and other non-medical staff to help out on the wards. Dr Brookes, medical director at Hampshire Hospitals NHS Trust, raised the alarm over the pressure his A&E department in Basingstoke was coming under. He said: ‘It is important people understand this is unprecedented. There is no doubt that we, and other hospitals around the country, are facing extraordinary challenges.’ Dr Brookes revealed that the A&E department was dealing with 11 per cent more patients than at the same period last year and was struggling to move patients on and make space for new arrivals. He said: ‘There are problems with access to adult services – we are seeing a lot of frail, elderly people who need special care. If the back door is blocked, it makes it difficult to get in the front door.’ The trust has tried to relieve the pressure on doctors and nurses by asking administrative and IT staff to help on wards by serving meals or sorting laundry. In a leaked email, management told staff: ‘There is a desperate need to support clinical staff on wards.’ It is not the first time Mr Cameron’s brother-in-law has embarrassed the Prime Minister over the NHS. Four years ago, he warned hospitals could lose out under the Coalition’s controversial NHS reforms by giving too much power to GPs, though he later backtracked on the remark. Dr Brookes and the trust were not available for comment last night, but Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘If Mr Cameron won’t listen to patients and the public, maybe his own family will have better luck. ‘He has been warned for months about the A&E crisis he’s caused.’","Super A&E department opened at Cramlington Hospital, Northumbia .

"Of all the endurance rallies around the world, Dakar is known as the deadliest, most dangerous - and many say, most fun. It has the largest following of all, and more than 80 per cent of competitors are amateurs who pay handsomely for the privilege of taking part. And they know they might not even make it past the first stage. Terrains are much tougher than at any other rally. Beastly off-road vehicles struggle to pass even the first stage, battling with salt, mud, dunes, rocks, and sky-high altitudes. Every year the pictures that emerge from the spectacular event look more dramatic, more dangerous... and more enticing. But what is it really like on the road with the daredevils and petrol heads who love nothing more than challenging themselves across some of the world's most extreme terrains? Scroll down for video . Victorious Mini driver Nasser Al-Attiyah of Qatar thrashes through the 12th stage of the Dakar Rally 2015 from Termas de Rio Hondo to Rosario . We made our way riding for three hours along rocky desert terrain during the Argentina stages of the race listening to classic rock . The 9,000km route changes every year and organisers ensure competitors are pushed to their limits. But if it was easy - if it was feasibly doable - it wouldn't be a Dakar. Serious competitors spend many months leading up to the race preparing for the toughest parts of the course: getting fit spinning at the gym, wearing oxygen masks for high altitude, and trying to figure out the route. All the information they're allowed to navigate them through the race is a rolling paper guide connected to the wheels detailing kilometres and direction. Many don't stand a chance, but they can't get enough. As ex-sponsored female competitor Florence Migraine-Bourgnon, stunning and fearless, who's completed four Dakars, says: 'I don't really like cars. I just f****** love Dakar.' Who says it's a man's world? I joined five-time reigning champions Mini for the first few days of the world's most dangerous rally raid. Luckily for me, I started at the first section, taking me from a glamorous launch in Buenos Aires up to rough and tough racing in San Juan, in the west of the country. On the day of the launch, main roads were closed and people lined up behind the metal barricades to catch a glimpse of the parade . Locals with their babies and pushchairs came to see the motorsport superstars, various street food stations had popped up everywhere . On the day before the launch, busy and bustling Buenos Aires fell silent as locals stayed at home. Main roads were closed and lined with metal barricades. In a huge city centre, this is something only really seen at sporting events with the grandiose of Tour De France. And the following day,  the city came alive. Locals with their babies and pushchairs came to see the motorsport superstars (most of them self-styled) soak up their glory. Entire families piled along every barricade and barrier, eagerly awaiting their arrival; it was clear the Argentine like cars just as much as football. A parade was due to start, ending in the town square where each of the 414 bike, quad, car and truck competitors were to mount the podium. First are those who paid to take part (about 80 per cent; fees start at £11,000 just to register a bike), then, last year's sponsored and professional competitors, and finally the 2014 winners. Dakar merchandise and party paraphernalia sellers lined the pavement, various street food stations had popped up everywhere. The atmosphere is like London's Notting Hill Carnival x 10 - and the showgirls are the sort made of ten tonnes of steel with sponsor logos slapped across their shiny bits, hooting for attention. 2014 winner Nani Roma and copilot Michel Périn arrive at the podium in their Monster Mini .

The only 'Dakar' left in the race is the Dakar Village, a meeting place for the competitors (located in Buenos Aires). But while there may no longer be threats of terrorism putting drivers at risk, the race course remains as dangerous as ever, changing vastly each year, with challenging altitudes and extreme terrain putting the baddest cars to the ultimate test. Watching the event unfold first hand was heart-stopping. On the very first day Nani Roma, 2014 Dakar champion, a firm favourite to win again, broke down after 10km. But Mini were still in the lead with several drivers in the top 20 of the car category. The Mini off-road rally car has been developed and redeveloped for years now; and has been customised by genius engineers into somewhat of a transformer. A beast almost impossible to better. Mini driver Nasser Al-Attiyah led the race throughout and was crowned overall 2015 champion when the rally ended two weeks later, on January 17. We witnessed the drivers battle it out in the desert close up and in astounding luxury on our tour. Owned by the French ASO (Amaury Sport Organisation) - Dakar was devised by a Frenchman after all, with the start point being Paris, back in 1978 - the VIP Dakar tours are run by sister company VSO, Dakar's very own travel agent. I joined one such three-day VSO tour at the start of the rally taking me from Buenos Aires to San Juan and back again. It was VIP luxury and up-close action all the way - somewhat of an oxymoron - including a fascinating tour of a bivouac. The ginormous mobile service station and base camp is where all weary heroes head for food, rest, and to fix up their ride. Hundreds of huge trucks full of mechanics and spare parts are stationed nearby daily along each stage of the race. Two bivouacs are built at any one time and take three days to erect. We were lucky enough to get to look around and see car doctors mend the machines and even dine with the drivers. We were lucky enough to get to look around and see car doctors mend the machines . While car nuts do come on VSO tours, their main customers are cash-rich sponsors. Dakar sponsors such as Red Bull and Total make up 45 per cent of customers while competitor sponsors such as Mini make up 38 per cent. Friends and family of those competing, plus 'passionate people', as Florence says, make up 15 per cent. It's a flat fee for everyone. Of 350 VSO guests each year, there are about 10 who are unrelated to the race, so it's still a small pool for adventurous travellers. Florence has competed four times - three of those in Africa - and now makes an absolute dream 'tour guide' of sorts with VSO, her second career, with whom she's worked for the past two years. She knows the Dakar from the inside out. On day three of the tour we went off-road in 4x4s, to sample Dakar like the competitors do.

Arlington officials sent a letter Wednesday to the owners of a North Cooper Street home demanding them to stop throwing weekly lavish, erotic parties, accusing them of illegally operating a home-based business, the Star-Telegram reports. Since May, David Esopenko has been throwing these parties at the 4,680-square-foot house called 'Eutopia' located in an upscale North Arlington neighborhood. The address is described online as a new and exciting 'lifestyle venue,' according to its website. Scroll down for video . Letter: Arlington officials sent a letter Wednesday to the owners of a North Cooper Street home (photographed) demanding them to stop throwing weekly lavish, erotic parties, accusing them of illegally operating a home-based business . Parties: Since May, David Esopenko (right)  has been throwing these parties at the 4,680-square-foot house called 'Eutopia' located in an upscale North Arlington neighborhood . Esopenko leases the house for the private parties that see a guest list of up to 200 people, according to the Telegram, and has reportedly had nearly 60 of the erotic parties -- some with themes. The city began investigating Eutopia after receiving complaints from neighbors about noise, weekend traffic, and Esopenko paving over the property's lawn to accommodate up to 70 vehicles at a time. 'This is a sexually-oriented swingers' club in my neighborhood,' Jon Vecchio, a neighbor, told USA Today. 'We don't want it here.' While some of the neighborhood's residents question the morality of the establishment that offers  food, drinks, and condoms, city officials say it's a zoning issue. 'This isn't a morality issue for us, though. We're looking at this specific residence,' Jay Warren, an Arlington spokesman, told FOX. 'It is a residence. It is a home. It should be used as that and not a business to the extent we found there at that residence.' Erotic: Esopenko leases the house for the private parties that see a guest list of up to 200 people, and has reportedly had nearly 60 of the erotic parties -- some with themes. Features: The three-story Eutopia features several playrooms with mirrors, a dance floor, a pool, and a kitchen area . The city holds that Eutopia is a business operating out of a single-family home because of its regular hours of operation (each weekend from 8.30pm to 3am), its promotional advertising, and its services which  include a valet for the guests and sometimes laundry service, according to the Arlington Voice. According to the Telegram, the three-story Eutopia features several playrooms with mirrors, a dance floor, a pool, and a kitchen area. The voice reports that police sent undercover officers to investigate the alleged 'sex club' after receiving multiple complaints last summer but the officers reported no illegal activity going on in the residence. The home, leased to Esopenko by its owner James Self, is completely furnished, but no one lives there, according to USA Today. Furnished: The home, leased to Esopenko by its owner James Self, is completely furnished, but no one lives there . Zoning: While some of the neighborhood's residents question the morality of the establishment that offers food, drinks, and condoms, city officials say it's a zoning issue . Favorite: Many praised the operations at the three-story venue calling it 'sensual' and their 'favorite place to play' Friends: Esopenko holds that he is simply throwing parties for his close friends . In the letter sent to Esopenko and Self, city officials spoke of the home-based business guidelines, which require the owner of the business to live in the home, the Voice reports. The letter also claims that the parties are the primary use for the house, and not secondary to the single-family home unit. Esopenko told WFAA that Eutopia is not a swinger's club because he does not charge guests, instead the party-goers may make donations: $80 for couples, $20 for single women, and $80 for single men. The city holds that these donations rake in thousands of dollars a night for Eutopia, however, Esopenko says none of the money is pocketed, rather used for snacks and drink set up. 'The average person that comes is a nurse, teacher, fireman, policeman, judge, former Arlington city councilman,' Esopenko told the Telegram. 'These are people who don't like to go to normal clubs to hang out because they are too dark, too loud.' And the 'lifestyle venue' has received positive reviews on swinger sites like Swinger Date Club. Many praised the operations at the three-story venue calling it 'sensual' and their 'favorite place to play.' Other reviewers have described Eutopia as a 'clean, beautiful home full of sexy, smart people,' the Telegram reports. One reviewer wrote: 'The only drawback I've found is the mattresses are a little hard, but that won't stop me from having fun there.' An online advertisement indicates that the next party will be a Super Bowl pre-party called 'Jersey Night' held Saturday. Esopenko holds that he is simply throwing parties for his close friends, and the property's owner, Self, told the Telegram that he plans to sell the house to Esopenko saying his friend pays his rent on time each month. 'Jersey Night:' An online advertisement indicates that the next party will be a Super Bowl pre-party called 'Jersey Night' held Saturday . Self said that the media coverage on Eutopia has led to phone calls from his friends, asking if he's running a sex club. 'When you rent a property, you do what you want to with it,' Self told the Telegram. 'I've been to one of his parties. It is drug-free. You don't leave drunk. He's very, very strict on everything. It was a well-run, very classy adult party.' City officials say the magnitude of the operations, combined with complaints illustrates the negative impact Eutopia has on the neighborhood. Eutopia has been cited twice for parking violations and the amount of vehicles parked at one time may prove to be a hazard as cars stack up on the right-hand lane of the street, the Voice reports. Esopenko said what the city is doing is bullying him to shut Eutopia down, according to the Telegram. 'This is intimidation by the city thinking we'll go, 'Oh, my, we're embarrassed.' We are not embarrassed about what we are doing,' Esopenko said. The city is giving Esopenko ten days to make an action on the order. He says he plans to appeal.","The City of Arlington is ordering David Esopenko to shut down his alleged swinger's club operated in a mansion called 'Eutopia'

"The troubled inquiry into historic child abuse is facing fresh criticism after it emerged that panel members were told what to say to MPs by a long-serving Home Office official. Experts and abuse survivors were given a 23-page document advising them how to answer ‘difficult questions’ when they appeared before a high-profile committee, prompting fears that the huge Government-ordered investigation is not independent. It can also be revealed that the woman in charge of administration for the inquiry was seconded from the Home Office, where she has worked for 36 years – even though the department is at the centre of many of the allegations of cover-ups and VIP paedophile rings. Police watchdog Dru Sharpling (left) and academic Jenny Pearce were emailed a 23-page document outlining key kessages, key facts, and a chronology to use when they were quizzed by Labour MP Keith Vaz (right) Last night critics said it was yet another blow to the reputation of the inquiry, which has barely begun work more than six months after it was announced. Baroness Butler-Sloss and Fiona Woolf both had to quit as chairman over conflicts of interest, with the replacement due to be announced this week. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We are concerned that members of the secretariat, who have been seconded from the Home Office, have told witnesses what to say.’ He led the questioning of police watchdog Dru Sharpling and academic Jenny Pearce when the panellists appeared before his committee last month to discuss the turmoil. Internal emails now reveal that the two witnesses had been given detailed ‘key messages’, ‘key facts’ and a ‘chronology’ to learn, as well as instructions on ‘difficult questions’. It is just the latest blunder to hit the inquiry, after Fiona Woolf (left) and Baroness Butler-Sloss (right) were forced to resign as chairman over possible conflicts of interest . The email was sent by Angela Kyle, ‘head of secretariat’ for the inquiry, who is effectively running its administration. She has been a Home Office employee since October 1978, a time when the department was allegedly giving funding to the Paedophile Information Exchange. The late Leon Brittan was criticised for failing to outlaw PIE when he was Home Secretary in the 1980s and for not taking action on a dossier of alleged high-profile child abusers. Responses given by panel members to the Home Affairs Committee on January 16 matched the answers suggested in advance by Mrs Kyle, including those on questions on whether the panel was going to be disbanded and who should chair the inquiry. A spokesman for the inquiry said: ‘There was no coaching of panel members, but advice was legitimately given.’","Dru Sharpling and Jenny Pearce given document before being grilled .

"Angela Merkel flatly rejected calls yesterday to write off any more Greek debts amid mounting tensions within Europe over the country's multi-billion euro bailout programme. The German Chancellor's comments dealt a blow to the new Greek government, which is pushing for a compromise on the tough austerity conditions with which it must comply. She told the Hamburger Abendblatt: 'I do not envisage fresh debt cancellation. There has already been voluntary debt forgiveness by private creditors, banks have already slashed billions from Greece's debt.'

Bailout: Greece's new government, headed by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (pictured) is pushing for a compromise on the tough austerity conditions with which it must comply . However, commentators said her tough stance is aimed at German taxpayers worried about European insatiability, and that Greece will ultimately be allowed to repay the debt over a longer period. Vicky Pryce, chief economic advisor for consultancy firm CEBR, said other countries including Spain, where thousands protested against austerity yesterday, could win similar concessions. Greece's new government has begun to roll back some of the conditions demanded by the EU and International Monetary Fund in return for a 240 billion euro bailout in 2010. The country says it will negotiate to halve the debt. It owes more than 315 billion euros, an EU record.","The German Chancellor rejected calls to write off any more of Greece's debts .

"Charles Manson is trying to become a father. Matthew Roberts, the son of the notorious criminal, has revealed that one of the reasons his father is set to wed Afton Elaine Burton, who goes by the name Star, is so that the two can have a child. And while the two are not allowed conjugal visits, Roberts says of his father; 'Somehow he hopes to smuggle his sperm out of the prison.' He then added; 'He wants to see what it might be like to raise a child with more of his own ideas. He is starting to think about how he wants his legacy to be left once he’s gone.'

Afton Elaine Burton, who calls herself Star, was spotted fabric shopping and looking at white satin, possibly for a wedding dress to sew for her jailhouse ceremony recently . Star is set to wed Charles Manson in a ceremony that will possibly take place this weekend . Manson was granted a marriage license to marry Star in November of last year . Star, 26, says she has been a fan on Manson, 80, since she was a teenager . Roberts also said in his interview with The Mirror that his father has wanted this for many years. 'Part of the whole thing with him marrying Star is that he would love to have kids and he was waiting for someone to come along and provide that,' he explained. This as Star was spotted fabric shopping and looking at white satin, possibly for a wedding dress to sew for her jailhouse ceremony. The 26-year-old has been writing to the killer since she was a teen and even moved from her home in Illinois to the California town where he is imprisoned. Previous reports had said the two were already married, but a formal ceremony has yet to be held. The couple filed for a marriage license on November 7, which gave them just 90 days to carry out the nuptials. California Department of Corrections spokesman Jeffrey Callison previously stated that the wedding would have to take place on a visiting day, which happen on Saturdays, Sundays and certain holidays (including Thanksgiving). Callison said the couple would be allowed 10 guests from outside the prison, two guests from inside the prison and an officiant of their own choosing. However, the two are not be allowed to consummate their marriage since Manson's life in prison sentence bans him from receiving conjugal visits. In previous interviews, Star gushed about falling in love with Manson and his 'philosophy' as a teen, and how she already considered herself married to him. n previous interviews, Star said she fell in love with Manson and his 'philosophy' as a teenager .

'I'm completely with him, and he's completely with me. It's what I was born for, you know. I don't know what else to say,' she told CNN in August. Manson has been in prison for the last four decades, after he and four disciples of his doomsday cult carried out a series of murders in 1969. One of their victims was Roman Polanski's actress wife Sharon Tate, who was butchered to death in her upscale southern California home when she was eight and a half months pregnant. Manson and his disciples were initially sentenced to death, but later had those sentences commuted to life in prison. In 2012, he applied and was denied parole, and cannot apply again until 2027 which means the couple have little chance of living together in matrimony. Manson has been married twice before, first to Rosalie Jean Willis from 1955 to 1958 and then to Candy Stevens from 1959 to 1963. Star has also been compared to one of Manson's disciples Susan Atkins, known as 'Sexy Sadie', who was also convicted of participating in eight of the August 1969 killings. Manson and his 'Family' of disciples carried out a series of murders in August 1969, which they thought would bring about a 'Helter Skelter' race war. The murders were centered on affluent Los Angeles neighborhoods, which they tried to pin on African American.","The son on Charles Manson says his father is trying to smuggle sperm out of prion to get his bride Afton Elaine Burton pregnant .

"A puppy allegedly left for dead after being punched and struck with a shovel is recovering after police rescued her from underneath two feet of snow. Bronx residents say they watched in shock as Raul Cruz, 43,  punched, kicked and beat his 6-month-old brindle pit bull mix Hennessy with a shovel Thursday before burying her under a snowbank. The New York Daily News reports that when police responded early Friday morning after a neighbor heard Hennessy whimpering, officers found only her snout sticking out from the snow. Dogged determination: Hennessy, a six-month-old puppy rescued from under a snowbank after being allegedly beaten by her owner, is struggling to hang on . 'We had to physically dig her out of the snow,' said Sgt Derek Mercado, a dog owner himself, who was troubled by the sight he saw when he arrived shortly before 3a.m. 'She was crying and she was actually trying to pull herself out as we were digging,' Mercado continued. 'As soon as we got enough room for her to get out, she popped right out and ran right up to me.' Court documents state that Cruz kicked, beat and threw Hennessy around in the yard behind his Longwood apartment.Hennessy around the yard. Residents said Cruz took the dog into a shed, from which residents heard 'yells and animal like screaming,' according to court documents. According to the New York Post, witnesses showed police a recorded of the beating and said it wasn't the first time Cruz had abused the dog. Officers took Hennessy back to the station house, where the starving pup gobbled down food police offered her, then transferred her to an emergency animal hospital. Abuse: Witnesses say that Raul Cruz, 43, who lives in this Bronx apartment building, has beaten Hennessy before and showed police a video of the alleged abuse . Hennessy wound up with the ASPCA and a veterinarian who treated her said she had fractures to her skull, legs, ribs and back, and said she'd lost a few teeth, according to court documents. 'It seemed like something was wrong with her back legs,'  Mercado said to the Daily News. 'When we got her out, I knew that we had to do whatever we could to catch this guy.' Police found Cruz nearby and arrested him on charges of aggravated animal cruelty, along with weapons possession and torturing and not feeding an animal. He was held on $5,000 bail Friday, which officials said a relative posted. Neighbors said they hoped that Cruz would be punished for the alleged abuse.

"The 17-year-old girl who faces several serious charges after allegedly tying an elderly man up to a table and stealing his credit cards to go shopping and is blaming the date-gone-wrong on her twin sister appeared in court on Thursday. Shalaine Foster has claimed it was her twin sister Shaina who met victim Paul Aronson, and led the plan to bind the 85-year-old up and steal his credit cards to go on a shooting spree while he lay helpless for 20 hours. The girls did not get good news in court this week either, being told they would stay in jail as the judge had still not made a ruling. Despite this however, Shalaine was seen grinning in court, as her sister Shaina looked more solemn. Both could be sentenced to life in prison. 'He asked me to do things that I wasn’t going to do,' Shaina said at the time. 'He’s ugly, old and disgusting. I tied him up. I took his money and left. He was starting to creep me out. I brought the zip ties in case of a situation where I needed them. Don’t get my sister in trouble. I brought her there.' Shalaine Foster (above) was seen smiling in court on Thursday as she is being charged with kidnapping, burglary, robbery, assault, and grand larceny . Her twin sister Shania (above) appeared more solemn, as the girl's are said to have attacked an octogenarian . Shalaine (right) says it was all Shania's (idea) and that she just went along with it . 'There’s always that story of the good twin and the bad twin, who goes right and who goes wrong,' defense lawyer Brian Kennedy said in November, as both sisters pleaded not guilty to a handful of charges related to the October incident. 'My client Sh​alaine was always going right but it seems she got caught up in something that was not of her making.' When she was first arrested last October, Shaina took full responsibility for the incident in an interview with police. Both sisters pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping, burglary, robbery, assault, and grand larceny and face a minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted of kidnapping. It was Shaina who allegedly met Aronson, a retired lawyer, on the website SeekingArrangement.com, which pairs older, wealthier men, with young women looking for 'sugar daddies'. Shalaine  (left) is accused of tying up 85-year-old Paul Aronson (right) and leaving the elderly man for 20 hours while she and her twin sister Shaina went on a shopping spree . 17-year-old Shalaine pleaded not guilty to charges related to the incident in November, saying her sister  met the man on Seeking Arangements . When Aronson invited Shaina to dinner, she asked her sister to come along and after the meal the threesome went back to the older man's luxury townhouse on East 38th Street in Manhattan. Aronson then offered the underage sisters more alcohol before the night took a sour turn and he found himself on the floor, bound to his coffee table. 'Defendant Shaina Foster zip tied informant’s leg to a coffee table while defendant Shalaine Foster zip tied informant’s hands behind his back,' according to court files. 'The informant fell onto the floor and could not get up and laid on the ground for approximately 20 hours.' Meanwhile, the girls stole Aronson's credit cards and $470 in cash before going shopping for make-up, it was claimed. Aronson was eventually found by a friend who freed him and called police. The girls, who both have criminal records, were held without bail in a Manhattan Criminal Court after their arrest. Previously, they lived in two separate foster homes. The New York Daily News spoke to the girls' brother outside the courtroom in when they were first arraigned last October and he said: 'The story sounds f****ed up'. The sisters stole Aronson's credit cards and $470 in cash before leaving him tied to a coffee table at his luxury townhouse on Manhattan's East 38th Street. Aronson lay helplessly on the floor for 20 hours until he was discovered by a friend . 'But it’s also an 85-year-old wealthy man who basically has these young girls like they’re in a candy store,' he said. 'We know he bought them liquor and intoxicated them and took him back to the house.' Reporters also spoke the twins' mother who is denying all accusations against her daughters. 'These are 17-year-old girls ... college-bound, upstanding citizens,' said their overwhelmed mother. 'They’re not sleazy girls at all, whatsoever. It’s going to ruin their lives forever.' 'I don’t know what to say other than this is horrible,' she said. Shaina has one felony arrest for possession of a sealed instrument (alcoholic beverage) plus one sealed arrest. Shalaine was arrested last April for introduction of prison contraband in addition to two sealed arrests. While the age of consent in 17 in New York, the website Seekingarrangement.com states that all members must be over the age of 18. The site defines a sugar daddy as, 'Successful men and women who know what they want. They’re driven, and enjoy attractive company by their side. Money isn’t an issue, thus they are generous when it comes to supporting a Sugar Baby.' A sugar baby is described as, ‘Attractive people looking for the finer things in life. They appreciate exotic trips and gifts. Sugar Babies get to experience a luxurious lifestyle, and meet wealthy people on a regular basis.’ Last month, MailOnline contacted Seeking Arrangement to inquire about how they regulate the safety of their members and ensure they are of legal age. In an emailed statement Seeking Arrangement speedily replied, 'We require individuals to be 18 years or older in order to use our site. We rely on self-reporting which is the same age verification process all other dating websites and social media platforms use. 'Unfortunately, there are some people who lie about their age. If we have any reason to suspect that a member is underage, we take immediate action and ask for proof of identity before that member will be allowed to continue using our site. If they cannot provide proof then they are suspended and removed from the site.' In regard to background checks and ensuring the safety of their members they said: 'SeekingArrangement.com goes to great lengths to protect the integrity of our site, and our members. Not only do we vet every member before a profile is approved, we also are one of the only online dating sites that offer background verification. While this is not a requirement, we encourage all members to only date those who have been background verified.' That being said, members on any dating site or online should proceed with caution before meeting in person.","Shalaine Foster and her twin sister Shaina appeared in court on Thursday after the reportedly attacked an octogenerian .

"Britain's bakers have pleaded with David Cameron to put sandwiches back on the menu after the Prime Minister declared he was giving up bread to lose weight. Letters have been sent to No 10 from the Federation of Bakers, which represents manufacturers, and the Craft Bakers Association on behalf of 600 High Street bakers. They are upset because sales of supermarket bread have declined by nine per cent in two years, largely due to the trend for ‘low-carb’ diets. Tasty: David Cameron is seen here admiring some loaves of bread, but has now cut back as he pursues a low-carb diet - causing Federation of Bakers to write to Downing Street . Federation director Gordon Polson said: ‘We have to combat this idea that carbs are bad for you. If you go to a dietician they don’t tell you to stop the carbs. The Government recommends they should be a third of your diet.’ The Prime Minister said recently that he was now watching what he eats and taking extra exercise, after admitting: ‘I have put on a bit of Christmas. I can feel a bit of tightening around the belt buckle.’ Mr Cameron added: ‘I was out pounding the pavements on a run yesterday and I will be doing a bit of light dieting over the next few weeks and hopefully I will shed the pounds. 'I’m running a couple of miles every other day. It is easier to put it on than to take it off.’ Cautious: The Prime Minister has admitted he is watching what he eats and taking extra exercise - including a New Year run - after putting on weight last year . Mr Cameron said he did not weigh himself but admitted he realised he had gained weight after photos emerged of him taking part in an annual Christmas mud run in his constituency of Witney in Oxfordshire. The Prime Minister has spoken several times about his battle with middle-age spread. In an interview with Now magazine in 2012 he was asked about his New Year’s resolutions and replied: ‘Probably to lose a bit of weight, I think. That’s the key one for me.’","Federation of Bakers write to Downing Street asking PM to back bread .

The fighter, who has a British accent, says: 'To the Japanese government: You, like your foolish allies in the Satanic coalition, have yet to understand that we, by Allah's grace, are an Islamic Caliphate with authority and power, an entire army thirsty for your blood. '(Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe, because of your reckless decision to take part in an unwinnable war, this knife will not only slaughter Kenji, but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found. 'So let the nightmare for Japan begin.' The footage has appeared just a day after Japan's deputy foreign minister, Yasuhide Nakayama, told journalists that negotiations for Mr Goto's release were 'in a state of deadlock'. Tonight the Japanese government has strongly condemned the apparent killing. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: 'I cannot help feeling strong indignation that an inhuman and despicable act of terrorism like this has been committed again.' Japanese authorities have said the video is most likely genuine. A statement from a cabinet meeting of senior politicians said the footage 'has a high degree of credibility.' Prime Minister Shinzo Abe added: 'I feel strong indignation at this inhumane and contemptible act of terrorism. I will never forgive these terrorists.' 'Japan will work with the international community to bring those responsible for this crime to justice,' he said, reiterating that Japan would not give in to terrorism. Mr Goto's mother and brother have both paid tribute to the war correspondent this evening. Mr Goto, a war correspondent with experience of reporting from Middle East conflict zones, went missing in October last year as he went to help fellow Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa . Mr Goto was last heard from a week ago, when an audio clip emerged claiming to be by him, saying Mr Yukawa had been killed and asking for failed suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi to be released . 'I was hoping Kenji would come back alive to thank everyone who had supported him,"" Goto's brother Junichi Goto, told  broadcaster NHK TV. 'I am filled with sadness he couldn't do it.' Goto's mother, Junko Ishido, told NHK TV her son's death showed he was a kind gentle man, trying to save another hostage. On Saturday, President Barack Obama led global condemnation of the apparent slaying, deeming it a 'heinous murder' and saying the US stands in solidarity with Japan against the 'barbaric act'. In a statement, Obama called Goto courageous and said America applauds Japan's steadfast commitment to advancing peace and prosperity in the Middle East as well as around the world. Also on Saturday, Andreas Kreig, assistant professor for defence studies at King's College London, told MailOnline that he believes the footage is genuine. He said: 'The technology that is used to film, they way the shots are cut, the way the footage transitions from one shot to the next, this is all things we have seen before in ISIS videos.' Anthony Glees, Professor of Security Studies at Buckingham University, added: ‘This kind of video still has the power to shock. It’s particularly shocking because in this case everyone had a sense that Mr Goto may be released, as would the Jordanian pilot.’ Last night ISIS tweeted to say they were going to give King Abdullah, the deceased ruler of Saudi Arabia, a present on what would have been his 91st birthday. Last night terror expert Shiraz Maher, who works for King's College London, tweeted the message, and added: 'I suspect, sadly, we'll see hostage videos released soon.' Japanese Cabinet Chief Secretary Yoshihide Suga has condemned the attack, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has reiterated that Japan will never bow to terrorists . Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Yasuhide Nakayama was pictured leaving Jordan this evening in a car convoy after footage emerged claiming to show the beheading of Japanese ISIS hostage Kenji Goto . Protesters in Jordan demand to know the fate of Mu’adh al-Kasasibah, a pilot held by Islamic State who was threatened with death in the latest videos alongside Mr Goto . Asked whether he had been expecting ISIS to release footage this evening, Dr Kreig added: 'We had not been expecting anything, but something had to happen, because ISIS had issued an ultimatum that was not met.' Mr Goto first appeared in an ISIS propaganda video a week ago alongside fellow Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa, 42. ISIS demanded $200million for the release of both of the men, the same amount the Japnese government pledged to help fight the organisation. Last Saturday an audio recording emerged purporting to be of Mr Goto explaining that Mr Yukawa had been killed, and again pleading for his release. The voice claimed that ISIS had changed its demands, instead asking for the release of Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi, a failed suicide bomber currently on death row in Jordan. The video has emerged three days after ISIS asked for Sajida al-Rishawi to be brought to the Turkish border. However on that occasion they were threatening to kill Mu’adh al-Kasasibah, the Jordanian fighter pilot currently being held by the terror group after crash-landing on their territory in December. ISIS had been asking to exchange Mr Goto and Jordanian airforce pilot Mu’adh al-Kasasibah, who they are also holding hostage, for failed suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi, who is on death row in Jordan . There was no mention of the fate of al-Kasasibah in today's footage. Jordan had threatened to kill all of its ISIS hostages if he was harmed. Jordan's government spokesman, Mohammed al-Momani, declined comment late Saturday on the video of Goto's purported beheading. The Japanese government has said it is currently trying to verify the footage, which was distributed by ISIS' propaganda arm al-Furqan Media Foundation. The fate of Jordanian pilot Mu’adh al-Kasasibah, who ISIS had also been threatening to kill, was not mentioned in the latest video . Mr Goto, 47, a war correspondent with experience in Middle East hot spots, went to Syria in late October to try to help release Mr Yukawa, who was captured in July. Mr Yukawa's arrival in the Middle East followed a number of difficult years, which appeared to begin in 2005, when his business failed, leaving him in debt and, at one point, reportedly homeless. The Japnese government has previously condemned ISIS' threats against Mr Yukawa and Mr Goto, while stating that they will not cooperate with terrorists. After news of Mr Yukawa's killing spread, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said: 'Considering the unbearable pain and sorrow that his family must be feeling, I am speechless. 'Such act of terrorism is outrageous and impermissible, it causes me nothing but strong indignation. I condemn it strongly and resolutely.' U.S. officials said they were trying to confirm the authenticity of the video. Bernadette Meehan, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, said: 'We have seen the video purporting to show that Japanese citizen Kenji Goto has been murdered by the terrorist group ISIL. 'The United States strongly condemns ISIL's actions and we call for the immediate release of all the remaining hostages. We stand in solidarity with our ally Japan.' Junko Ishido, Mr Goto's mother, has previously issued a tearful appeal for her son to be released. If Mr Goto's death is confirmed, then he will join a list of other victims, including  Haruna Yukawa (left). British aid workers David Haines (centre), and Alan Henning (right) have also been murdered . US journalist James Foley (left) was the first to appear alongside Jihadi John in one of the sickening videos, followed by Steven Sotloff (centre. Aid worker Peter Kassig (right) is also dead . Speaking at a press conference last week, she said: 'I say to you people of the Islamic State, Kenji is not your enemy. Please release him. 'Kenji was always saying 'I hope to save lives of children on battlefields'. He was reporting war from a neutral position.' Mr Gotos' death, if confirmed, adds to a long list of foreign hostages that have apparently been killed by Jihadi John, including Harnua Yukawa. The list of victims also includes British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and aid worker Peter Kassig.","Kenji Goto threatened with beheading in ISIS video released last Saturday .

"It is the game that has been enjoyed by generations of schoolgirls on sports fields across the country. But now rounders may have met its match after a decision by the Government to axe it from the GCSE curriculum – a decision many fear will wreck the campaign to get more girls playing sport. Rounders is played by seven million boys and girls in more than 80 per cent of secondary schools and is one of the most popular choices of the 100,000 teenagers who take the PE GCSE each year. Popular: Rounders is played an estimated seven million boys and girls in more than 80 per cent of secondary schools around the country - but it has now been axed from the GCSE curriculum . Former player: The Duchess of Cambrige (front row, centre) was a talented rounders player and was the highest scorer in the 12/13 team at St Andrew's School in Pangbourne, Berkshire . The game dates from Tudor times and famous former players include the Duchess of Cambridge and singer Jessie J. But the Department for Education (DfE) has now removed it from the list of activities on which pupils can be judged in the exam – a move critics said could sound the ‘death knell’ for the sport in many schools. The game’s official body, Rounders England, said it was ‘deeply disappointed’ by the decision which it claimed discriminated against girls when there is huge concern about the number dropping out of sport. Former players and teachers also lamented the move, with former Olympic medallist Gail Emms saying she was ‘gutted’. Gutted: Former rounders player Gail Emms - who won Olympic badminton silver for Great Britain in 2004 - was left disappointed by the decision and said: 'I’m absolutely gutted. Rounders at our school was a real leveller in terms of ability' Until now, rounders has been included in a list of more than 40 sports and activities, including football, cricket, rugby, skiing and equestrianism, which teenagers who take PE GCSE can opt to be judged on. In rounders, teenagers are assessed on how they strike the ball, how they bowl and field, and tactical awareness. But Ministers have now cut out about 20 of the activities. In addition to rounders, judo, karate, mountain-biking and windsurfing have also been axed. One insider said rounders had suffered because it was seen by Ministers who are emphasising rigour in exams as a ‘soft option’. Alison Howard, of Rounders England, said: ‘We are deeply disappointed. The impact on the future provision of rounders in schools is of great concern. ‘It has particular appeal to girls and any change that reduces the opportunities for girls to play a sport is contrary to Government efforts to get more of them active.’ Olympic badminton medallist Gail Emms, who got an A grade in her PE GCSE, said: ‘I’m absolutely gutted. Rounders at our school was a real leveller in terms of ability. It also required tactics and teamwork.’ And Ann Haydon, principal of Surbiton High School in South-West London, once attended by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, said that there was now a danger the sport could ‘die a death’ in some schools. Sports Minister Helen Grant, a former junior judo champion, declined to comment. The DfE said: ‘We are reforming qualifications to ensure they are high quality, demanding and academically rigorous.’","Rounders is played by seven million pupils across the country's schools .

"A new Catholic women's initiative rolled out by the Vatican is at the centre of a storm of criticism over a video starring a 'sexy blonde'. The Internet promotional video, featuring blonde Italian actress Nancy Brilli, came under such ridicule that it was quickly taken down, it has been reported. In the clip, the 50-year-old, dressed in a blue top, asks her viewers how often they ask themselves 'Who are you? What do you do? What do you think about yourself as a woman?' A new Catholic women's initiative rolled out by the Vatican is at the centre of a storm of criticism over a video starring a 'sexy blonde' The Internet promotional video, featuring blonde Italian actress Nancy Brilli (pictured), came under such ridicule that it was quickly taken down, it has been reported . But the video soon sparked criticism from around the English speaking world. 'What were they thinking at the Vatican?' wrote Phyllis Zagano of Hofstra University in the National Catholic Reporter. 'Aside from the obvious - sexy sell has long gone by the boards in developed nations and is totally unacceptable in predominantly Muslim countries - the fact of the matter is that highlighting a stereotypical spokeswoman is not the way to ask for women's input.' The women's initiative came courtesy of Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi whose office launched the #lifeofwomen crowd-sourcing scheme just before Christmas. It was rolled out in a bid to promote an inaugural meeting this week aimed at studying women's issues. Women were invited from around the globe to send in a 60-second video of their lives for possible inclusion in a montage to be screened at the 'big meeting of cardinals and bishops'. The English version of Brilli's promo was taken down, though the Italian remains on the ministry's website, Associated Press reports.

Critics noted that the women the Vatican might most want to hear from - those suffering from poverty, violence or war - might not have a smart phone at hand to send in a clip. Others pointed out that the two-week deadline - at the height of the Christmas holidays - worked against any widespread response. The working paper for the Pontifical Council of Culture's plenary assembly on 'Women's Cultures: Equality and Difference' speaks about opening the church's doors to women so they can offer their skills 'in full collaboration and integration' with men. It denounces plastic surgery as a form of 'aggression' against the female body 'like a burqa made of flesh.' And it acknowledges that the church has for centuries offered women 'ideological and ancestral left-overs.' In the end, some 250 videos were sent in with a number of them coming from activists advocating for women's ordination. Consuela Corradi, a sociologist at Rome's Catholic Lumsa university, was one of 15 women who advised Ravasi on the initiative. She complained that criticism of the video was unfair. 'If we had chosen an ugly woman, would that have changed the message? I don't think so,' she said. She said the women consultants were entirely responsible for penning the working document, with no interference from the ministry, though she said their document was trimmed for length.","The women's initiative was rolled out by a Vatican office before Christmas .

"They have been a familiar site at the Queen's heels ever since she was presented with one for her 18th birthday in 1944. But now the Queen - who is known to be inseparable from her beloved Corgis - has decided against introducing any new dogs to Buckingham Palace. She no longer replaces the pets as they die and, as she gets older, she is worried about tripping over the small dogs. Scroll down for video . The Queen's Corgis have been a regular sight during her rule but she has ruled out introducing any new dogs . Queen Elizabeth arrives at Aberdeen Airport with her Corgis to start her holidays in Balmoral in 1974 . The Queen photographed in Windsor Great Park taking snaps of her Corgis in the 1960s . It comes after the Queen declined the offer of two puppies from her granddaughter Princess Beatrice. She asked her grandmother if she would like two of four Norfolk terriers, born to her own dog Ginger last September. A senior courtier told the Daily Express: 'The Queen thought it was a lovely offer but she politely declined. 'The fact is she worries about too many dogs around her feet and the danger she will trip up and hurt herself badly. She is after all 88 and not getting any younger. 'Her corgis are getting on a bit and move along at a sedate speed but a young dog would obviously be very lively and much more active. 'Her main fear is that if she fell and broke her arm or even a leg she would not be able to perform her duties for many weeks if not months, and that would upset her greatly.' While she has a reputation for being rather firm and fierce in other matters, the Queen is ridiculously soppy over her corgis . The Queen relaxes with Prince Philip with their Corgis while reading the newspapers at Balmoral in 1975 . Queen Elizabeth meets members of the Adelaide Hills Kennel Club and their Corgis during a trip in 2002 . Over the years, the Royal Family seem to have embraced dogs as their favoured pets. Formal portraits from the 17th century onwards show them posing with dogs, from pugs to greyhounds, King Charles Spaniels to Corgis. Some pets have even merited their own portraits. When Queen Victoria's beloved Collie, Noble, died at Balmoral in 1887, he was buried in the grounds of the castle and given his own gravestone. A terrier named Caesar belonging to King Edward VII was given even greater status when, having outlived the king, he walked behind His Majesty's coffin in the funeral procession. One of the Queen's Corgis, Monty, appeared in the James Bond scene for the Olympics opening ceremony. Corgis were first introduced to the royal circle by King George VI in 1933 when he bought a Corgi called Dookie from a local kennels. The animal proved popular with his daughters and a second Corgi was acquired called Jane who had puppies, two of which, Crackers and Carol, were kept. For her eighteenth birthday, The Queen was given a Corgi named Susan. She became the matriarch of the royal Corgi line and it was the beginning of a 70-year love affair. Some Corgis were mated with dachsunds  to create 'Dorgis', two of which, Candy and Vulcan, still survive, along with the two Corgis Willow and Holly. The Corgis have hit the headlines before - in 2004 one had to be put down after being savaged by an English bull terrier owned by Princess Anne when they ran out to greet her as she arrived at Sandringham for Christmas. Anne was convicted under the Dangerous Dogs Act the year before that after the same dog attacked two children, becoming the first member of the Royal Family ever to acquire a criminal record after admitting letting the dog run out of control. The Corgis have enjoyed life as Britain's most privileged pets. They live in palaces and castles, travel in chauffeur-driven limousines, fly by private plane or helicopter and are carried down aircraft steps by aides. The Queen is said to feed them fillet steak and chicken breast and all the food is cooked from scratch, with a new Corgi menu typed and posted to the kitchen wall daily. They live in a boxroom that holds their wicker baskets, raised a few inches off the floor to avoid draughts. It is situated in the royal apartments, around which the dogs wander at will.","Queen has decided against introducing new dogs to Buckingham Palace .

"Facing charges: Aideen Jones resigned after being charged with three cruelty offences against young boys . A charity fundraiser was given an OBE for her work with vulnerable people in the 2014 New Year’s Honours list – while she was under arrest on suspicion of child abuse. Aideen Jones has since been charged with three cruelty offences against two young boys in a case linked to the long-running North Wales abuse scandal. The 62-year-old, a former chief executive of Southdown Housing Association, was given the OBE a year ago ‘for services to people with intellectual disabilities’ despite being arrested the previous August by officers working on the investigation, Operation Pallial. Her husband Denis, 65, who once worked as a development officer at East Sussex Social Services with a ‘lead responsibility for fostering staff training’, has also been charged with four offences relating to two boys aged under 16 between 1975 and 1980. The couple will appear at Wrexham Magistrates’ Court on March 25. The revelation will inevitably raise questions because the Honours Committee, chaired by the head of the Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake, appears to have agreed to the award while Jones was under investigation, and announced the OBE in January 2014, four months after her arrest. Mr and Mrs Jones, who have been married for 41 years, were both carers at Bryn Alyn, one of 18 children’s homes in the former counties of Clywd Gynedd caught up in the historic child abuse scandal. The home’s owner John Allen, 73, was given a life sentence last December after he was found guilty of historical sex offences against 18 boys and one girl, and must serve a minimum of 11 years. Detectives are looking into 249 allegations of abuse at the homes between 1963 and 1992 and have arrested 35 people since the investigation began in 2012. Fifteen people have been charged, including Allen. Fourteen are due to stand trial this year, two released without charge and the remainder are on bail, while investigations continue. Mrs Jones, who is a fellow of the Institute of Directors, and her husband Denis have been living in Seaford, East Sussex, since 1983, and have become well known in the community, opening their courtyard garden to visitors to raise money for charity. Both have worked with vulnerable adults for the past four decades and ran their own company Praxis Training and Development Ltd until it was voluntarily dissolved in 2012. Jones, a former director of the Sussex Chamber of Commerce and the Housing and Support Alliance, resigned from her housing association job in November 2013 for ‘health and personal’ reasons. Her husband founded the company Junction (Young People Connecting) and was a director of Stay Up Late, a charity which promotes ‘full and active social lives for people with learning disabilities’. He resigned in October 2013. A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said it could not comment on individual cases, but added: ‘As part of the nomination process, we try to minimise the risk that prospective candidates have behaved in ways likely to bring the system into disrepute. ‘We protect the integrity of the honours system by carrying out probity checks with a number of Government departments before names are submitted.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Fundraiser was given OBE while under arrest on suspicion of child abuse .

"A North Carolina woman has been jailed for at least six years after faking her pregnancy so she could befriend a 22-year-old mother, before abducting her one-month-old baby daughter. Andrea Endara, 27, spent months pretending to be pregnant in 2012, including preparing her home in Charlotte for a baby, faking a bump and even attending a baby shower in her own honor.

But instead, she attacked Paz with a tire iron and pepper spray, prosecutors said. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Andrea Endara (pictured in her police mug shot), 27, has been jailed for at least six years after faking her pregnancy so she could befriend 22-year-old Carla Paz, before abducting her one-month-old daughter . Victim: Endara, who spent months pretending to be pregnant, kidnapped Paz's little girl (pictured). The infant was found unharmed, with Endara's boyfriend, by homicide detectives at an apartment complex in Charlotte . After allegedly threatening the victim with a knife, Endara then drove her and her two children to an apartment complex, where she grabbed hold of the youngsters and went inside, WBTV reported. Although she shortly returned with the four-year-old child, she left the little girl inside. She then drove Paz and the youngster back to their home, while assaulting the mother the entire time, it was said. At around 2am the following day, homicide detectives found the baby unharmed, with Endara's boyfriend, in an apartment unit at the Carmel On Providence Apartments on Knob Oak Lane. Now, Endara has been sentenced to three consecutive prison terms after being found guilty of child abduction and two counts of second-degree kidnapping, according to Fox 8 News. Safe return: The convict befriended Carla Paz - also the mother of a four-year-old child - in 2012, before offering to drive her to work. Above, Paz is pictured with her husband and rescued baby girl following Endara's arrest . Looking to the future: However, instead of driving Paz to work, Endara attacked her with a tire iron and pepper spray, prosecutors said. She then 'threatened the victim with a knife', before driving her and her children away . The terms are 20-33 months, 31-98 months and 25-42 months in length. This means Endara will serve a minimum sentence of six years. She could be imprisoned for up to 14 years. When she is released, the convict will be forced to register with the Sex Offender & Public Protection Registration Program for 30 years. During the abduction on May 1, 2012, Endara agreed to take Paz and her four-year-old child home on the condition that she did not disclose details of the crime to her husband, officials said. After offering to take her to work that evening, 'Endara pulled a knife on the mother and told her that she was taking her children,' CMPD Captain Rod Golding told 10 News at the time. Scene: The baby girl was found in a unit at the Carmel On Providence Apartments (above) on Knob Oak Lane . 'She agreed to take her back [home] on condition the mother not tell her husband what happened,' he added. 'And to tell her husband the [baby] was kidnapped by two black males in a gray car.' However, the husband had already contacted police to tell them that his wife and his two children had been kidnapped. Officers located the baby at the Carmel On Providence apartment hours later. Endara's boyfriend, who opened the door, admitted straight away 'he had the one-month-old baby'. He later told police he had believed his girlfriend was pregnant and wanted nothing to do with her. Although medics were called to the scene, the infant was found to be fine 'except for a wet diaper'. The jury could not reach a decision on assault charges against Endara.","Andrea Endara, 27, of North Carolina, spent months faking her pregnancy .

"Vince Cable launched an astonishing attack on George Osborne during a Cabinet meeting by openly mocking the Chancellor’s claim that the UK is outperforming other European economies. The Liberal Democrat Business Secretary stunned last week’s Cabinet by highlighting Mr Osborne’s repeated boast that the British Government could borrow money more cheaply than other European countries - because he claims that the markets back his austerity regime. Cuttingly, Mr Cable said he ‘couldn’t help noticing’ that figures suggested the UK was actually ‘on a par’ with the much-maligned socialist-style French and Italian economies, which Mr Osborne has derided for being debt-laden and uncompetitive. Vince Cable (left) launched an astonishing attack on George Osborne by openly mocking the Chancellor’s claim that the UK is outperforming other European economies . One source claimed: ‘When Cable spoke, George looked stormy. There was just the sound of indignant muttering from the Conservatives in the room.’ Mr Cable’s remarks will heighten tensions within the Coalition, which are already at breaking point with little more than three months to go until the General Election. They will also increase suspicions that the Business Secretary is trying to align himself closer to Labour ahead of potential talks on a post-Election Lib-Lab pact, which could see the 71-year-old former Labour Party member finally achieve his ambition to become Chancellor. When Mr Osborne appeared at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, he urged eurozone countries to copy his policy of slashing public spending and cited France and Italy as being in particular need of ‘structural reform’. When Vince Cable (pictured) spoke at the Cabinet meeting, George Osborne looked 'stormy', a source said . The Chancellor has repeatedly said in his Budget speeches that because of the strength of the British economy he has been able to borrow money more cheaply than most of our European competitors: the highest rates – known as bond yields – are charged by the City to countries with the greatest chance of going bust. But at the Cabinet meeting, Mr Cable said: ‘I can’t help noticing that the bond yields of France and Italy are now on a par with ours.’ However, sources close to Mr Osborne insisted: ‘There was an exchange, but in it Cable agreed with George that the eurozone economies still pose a destabilising risk to the British economy. In fact, it is one of the few things George and Vince do agree about.’ Mr Osborne has repeatedly argued that low UK bond yields represent a pat on the back from investors for his spending cuts. Last week, the yield on ten-year bonds was 1.3 per cent for the UK, compared with 1.5 per cent for Italy and 0.5 per cent for France. Last night, a senior Conservative source said that Mr Cable had irritated Tory Ministers in recent months by using meetings to praise the performance of the French economy under President Francois Hollande. Like Ed Miliband, Hollande has criticised ‘the economics of austerity’, as practised by Mr Osborne, arguing that Europe needs a ‘different way forward’ to deal with the debt crisis. Mr Cable declined to comment last night.","The Liberal Democrat Business Secretary stunned last week's Cabinet .

"Union leader Bob Crow was no stranger to bitter disputes in his lifetime – and now a rift over his legacy is to reach the High Court. Mr Crow's daughter with ex-wife Geraldine Horan, Kerrie Atlee, has lodged a writ against his partner Nicola Hoarau, after being left out of his will. Ms Hoarau, 52, is sole executor and trustee of the RMT leader's £106,000 estate but Mrs Atlee cannot believe her father would have ignored her and his grandchildren in his will, and claims it is riddled with errors. Mrs Atlee, 32, said: 'The will is very different to what I was told. This action is a last resort.' Ms Hoarau's solicitors dismiss the claims and say they will lodge a vehement defence later this week. When The Mail on Sunday tried to contact Ms Hoarau, her daughter said: 'No comment. We are still feeling our grief.' Scroll down for video . Mr Crow's daughter with ex-wife Geraldine Horan, Kerrie Atlee (pictured), has lodged a writ against his partner Nicola Hoarau . Former RMT leader Bob Crow was 52 when he died in March last year from a massive heart attack . The fortune Ms Hoarau has inherited is mainly made up of savings and investments. Mr Crow was 52 when he died in March last year from a massive heart attack. He cut a controversial figure – adored by his union members, but often heavily criticised by commuters and politicians for his eagerness to call Tube strikes in London while enjoying a champagne lifestyle. The RMT leader rose from a modest background to running an organisation with 80,000 members on a six-figure pay deal. Mr Crow was elected to run the RMT in 2002, catapulting him to national fame - and notoriety - as the most radical of a new generation of union leaders. Crow liked to be seen as a working-class hero, but was paid £145,000 a year, enjoyed fine dining in top London restaurants — memorably once quaffing champagne and running up a £650 lunch bill with four of his Left-wing brothers — and recently sparked a furore by taking a cruise to Latin America just before yet another of his strikes. Crow also came under fire for taking a holiday to Brazil on the eve of one Tube strike. But he defended his holiday, saying: 'What do you want me to do? Sit under a tree and read Karl Marx every day?' He also came in for criticism because of his insistence on living in publicly funded council accommodation in the north of the capital despite his hefty salary. However, the outspoken union boss always refused to apologise, saying that he deserved his pay packet, and insisted he had a right to live in the home which he shared with Ms Hoarau, an RMT employee.","Bob Crow's partner Nicola Hoarau, 50, and their children left £106,000 .

"Italian nuclear scientist Bruno Pontecorvo suddenly fled to the USSR in 1950 while in the middle of a holiday with his family . For decades the mystery of why Italian nuclear physicist Bruno Pontecorvo defected from the Allies to the USSR has baffled Cold War historians. The scientist, while on holiday in Italy with his wife and children in 1950, suddenly disappeared, resurfacing years later on the other side of the Iron Curtain. But now a new book has revealed that Pontecorvo was being trailed by the FBI for suspected communist activity, and has claimed that he fled to Russia after being tipped off by none other than infamous double agent Kim Philby. Pontecorvo, a prominent nuclear physicist in Britain, the U.S. and Canada, shocked the world when he defected to the USSR. After re-emerging five years later in Moscow, he eventually said he left for ideological reasons - but the real reason why he fled remained shrouded in mystery for more than 60 years. Frank Close, a scientist who believes that Pontecorvo could have gone on to win a Nobel prize had he stayed with the West, told the Observer that the FBI were investigating the Italian at the time of his disappearance. Mr Close obtained a previously classified letter from that shows the Americans suspected the scientist of having communist sympathies. The letter, written shortly before Pontecorvo went on holiday to Italy, was sent from the British embassy in Washington to MI5. It reads: 'The [FBI] now ask [for] any information which may be available to us which would indicate that Pontecorvo may be engaged in communist activities at the present time or [previously] during his residence in the United States.' It also says that the Secret Intelligence Service in Washington had been unable to find previous communications on the subject, sent by the FBI in 1943. Its representative in the U.S. capital was Philby - who later defected to the Soviet Union along with fellow members of the Cambridge spy ring. Mr Close believes that Philby would have known of the investigation and would have tipped off Russia, who would have immediately informed Pontecorvo and helped him escape. A new book claims that Pontecorvo escaped to Moscow after Kim Philby tipped off the Russians, who in turn tipped off the Italian physicist, that the scientist was being investigated by the FBI for communist activities . 'One might imagine that the failure to find the [FBI] letters occurred because he had destroyed the evidence,' Mr Close said. 'It's 99.9 per cent certain that Philby would then have informed [the Russians].' The letter appears in Mr Close's new book Half Life: The Divided Life of Bruno Pontecorvo. The book also suggests that the Italian had been passing secrets about the U.S. atomic programme to the USSR. The author interviewed Pontecorvo's son Gil, who is now 77, who recalled their sudden move to Moscow. A new book, written by scientist Frank Close (above), suggests Italian nuclear physicist Bruno Pontecorvo defected from the Allies to the USSR after being tipped off by double agent Kim Philby . Mr Close said the family flew from Rome to Moscow via Stockholm and Helsinki. He added: 'In Helsinki, they were in two cars and his father was in the trunk of one car. [The son] said, in a huge understatement, ""I knew something was up.""' Pontecorvo, became a British citizen in 1948 and was a member of the Atomic Energy Authority research station at Harwell, Berkshire. Kim Philby was a high-ranking member of the British Intelligence who worked as a double agent before defecting to the USSR in 1963. That year, he was revealed to be a member of the spy ring now known as the Cambridge Five, the other members of which were Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess, Anthony Blunt, and possibly, John Cairncross.

Kim Philby (pictured standing during a press conference) was a high-ranking member of the British Intelligence who worked as a double agent before defecting to the USSR in 1963 . Of the five, Philby was regarded as the most successful in providing secret information to the Soviet Union. Philby, who died in 1988, was misled by Moscow and believed he would be made a colonel in the KGB upon his arrival in Russia. In fact, he did not see the KGB's headquarters for ten years and was given little real work, spending a significant period under virtual house arrest as Russian agents feared he would return to London .","Italian nuclear physicist Bruno Pontecorvo mysteriously defected to USSR .

Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi chose the publication as the target of their attack after it repeatedly published cartoons of Mohammed, which some Muslims find deeply offensive. The magazine once renamed itself 'Sharia Hebdo', claimed to be guest edited by the Prophet and carried the cover slogan '100 lashes if you don't die laughing'.

"Wealthy parents pass on three quarters of their fortunes to their children meaning it will take 300 years for the offspring of today's super-rich to have average incomes, a survey has revealed. The sons and daughters of prestigious families are also likely to live longer than average, more likely to attend Oxbridge, live in expensive houses, and go on to become doctors or lawyers. There is also little difference in wealth or social standing when the richest families of the Victoria era are compared to their descendants today, according to the study. Scroll down for video . The study of 19,000 people, including 600 with rare surnames such as Pepys (after the noted diarist, pictured), found their modern-day descendants are just as wealthy as their Victorian counterparts . Publishing their findings in the Economic Journal, Professor Gregory Clark and Dr Neil Cummins said: 'What your great-great-grandfather was doing is still predictive of what you are doing now.' The pair examined the records of 19,000 people, including more than 600 rare family names such as Bazalgette, the Pepys, and Bigge. Joseph Bazalgette was responsible for building the world's first sewer system in London in the 19th century, the Pepys family tree contains noted diarist Samuel Pepys, and John Bigge was a judge and royal commissioner. They found that, compared to their relatives in 1850, those living with that surname today are almost certain to have amassed fortunes well beyond the reach of the average Briton. For example Sir Peter Bazalgette, the great-great-grandson of Sir Joseph, is the founder of Endemol television production company which created Big Brother and Deal or No Deal. The company was floated on the Dutch stock exchange in 2005. It trebled in value and was sold for £2.5billion in 2007. Survey estimates three quarters of any fortune is passed from parents to their children, meaning it will take 300 years for the offspring of today's super-rich to be as wealthy as the average Briton . The findings of Dr Clark and Dr Cummins, reported by The Guardian, suggest that the passing down of wealth has a far bigger impact on society than previously thought. The data showed a 'significant correlation between the wealth of families' even up to five generations apart. They estimate that three quarters of any estate is passed down to the offspring of wealthy families, despite inheritance taxes introduced in recent years. At that rate, it means that children of today's super-wealthy would take, on average, nearly three centuries to become as wealthy as the average Briton. Dr Clark and Dr Cummins said: 'Wilson, Thatcher, or Blair – the noisy cacophony of Westminster politics – makes no difference to the iron law of inheritance. 'Measures to promote social mobility have little prospect of succeeding. It’s always going to be the case that families with the greatest abilities will just pass them on to their children.'","19,000 people surveyed including 600 with rare surnames such Pepys .

"Mystery surrounds the diaries of Doris Lessing after the late Nobel Prize winner’s will stipulated they remain closed to the world as long as any of her children are alive. The novelist had a tangled sex life and often difficult relationships with her offspring, and her unusual decision has prompted speculation over the diaries’ contents. Lessing died aged 94 in 2013, leaving an estate worth £3 million – a striking fortune by any standards, but especially for someone known for her lifelong communist views. Complex life: Doris Lessing stipulated that her diaries remain closed to the world as long as any of her children are alive . The firebrand anti-apartheid campaigner and former Communist Party member also stated in her will, drawn up in 2009, that her diaries should remain sealed to her longstanding friend, the novelist Jenny Diski. Only her authorised biographer will be given access. Lessing requested the role be given to Sir Michael Holroyd, but he told The Mail on Sunday he is now too old at 79 to undertake the book. Sir Michael said of the diaries yesterday: ‘It may well be she thought they might be distressing for others, and she saw no point in that.’ He said he had not read them but conceded they may well contain revelations or observation about her family or sex life that could be upsetting. The book could take ‘the best part’ of ten years to complete, he said, and another biographer would be appointed. Sir Michael said the writer would have no restrictions and would be able to publish the biography because extracts from the diaries would be put into their wider context. Lessing, who wrote 54 books and became the oldest ever recipient of the Nobel prize for literature in 2007, did not say whether her biography should only be published after the death of all her children. Last night Ian Patterson, the 66-year-old husband of Miss Diski, said: ‘I think she wrote her thoughts about everything and didn’t want people to know. She was a cantankerous old woman.’ The anti apartheid and former Communist party member pictured back in 1961 . Lessing had an uneasy relationship for many years with her two eldest children John and Jean from her marriage to civil servant Frank Wisdom, which lasted from 1939 to 1943 while she was living in Rhodesia. She walked out on him, later claiming she had to escape ‘the intolerable boredom of colonial circles’, and left her two young children to live with him, although they became reconciled with her in later years. John, a coffee farmer in Zimbabwe, died in 1992. She also had a sometimes strained relationship with Miss Diski, a school friend of her son’s, after allowing her to move into her home as a ‘waif’ at the age of 15. Lessing’s sex life was colourful by 1940s and 1950s standards, with affairs during her two marriages and several relationships as an unmarried mother, including one with the Amer-ican writer Clancy Sigal. Lessing, who lived in north London, left £100,000 to Jean Cowen, 71, who is her only surviving child and lives in Cape Town, and similar amounts to Miss Diski, 67, and a friend Christopher Couch. Ms Cowen said yesterday: ‘My mother lived a long, very complex life. She was the most extraordinary human being.’ She added: ‘[Her will] does not reflect her great generosity towards many people, including myself, during her lifetime. ‘I and other family members have long known she was a diarist, and that access to her diaries would be stringently limited for a long time. That is not too difficult to live with.’","Nobel Prize winner's will stipulated diaries were closed while children alive .

Mrs Morgan will this week set out ambitious plans to rocket England to the top of the European league tables for reading and maths by 2020 – and become fifth best in the world. At present England lags back in 26th place in the world for maths and 23rd for reading. 'Three Rs': At present England lags back in 26th place in the world for maths and 23rd for reading .

Under a future Conservative Government, all 11 year olds will be expected to: . If Mrs Morgan fails to live up to her bold promise, she can expect to pay a heavy price. Former Labour Education Secretary Estelle Morris was forced to resign in 2002 after she made a similarly bold declaration – and failed to deliver. However, Mrs Morgan – one of the rising stars of the Government – has given herself some wriggle room by saying that she will be judged on whether she has met her target by tests in 2021, one year after the next Parliament if, as expected, it lasts until 2020.

She will be keen to make her mark on the department after being called 'U-turn Nicky' for reversing some of Mr Gove's policies such as snap inspections of schools to root out Islamic extremism and relaxing rules on taking children out of school in term time. Education is expected to be a key Election battleground, with polls indictaing that Labour and the Conservatives are neck-and-neck on the issue. As part of the new drive, Mrs Morgan will also toughen up existing tests in the 'three Rs' for all children when they leave primary school. And there will be stiff sanctions for schools which do not meet Mrs Morgan's standards: those which fail to ensure all pupils master the basics of English and maths for two years in a row will be forced to become academies free of town hall control, or join up with local high-performing schools.

It is unclear why the woman attacked her former lover's vehicle.","Shocking footage captured of a 31-year-old woman in Angarsk, Russia .

"A woman who secretly married one of the richest men in the world fears she and her six-year-old son face destitution because of plans to deport her from Britain. For years, Nivin El Gamal has been locked in a bitter legal dispute with Sheik Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum – an uncle of the ruler of Dubai – over his refusal to acknowledge their son. After a series of court hearings and a paternity test, Sheik Ahmed – who is said to be worth billions – was forced to agree a generous maintenance settlement. Now, Egyptian-born interior designer Ms El Gamal, 38, could be deported, which would mean she loses the financial protection awarded by the High Court. She says she is in the UK legally as she applied for residency when her visa was due to expire in July 2013. Ms El Gamal, who was born into an influential Egyptian family, met Sheik Ahmed, 56, in Dubai in 2004 . She feels angry and betrayed, but most of all sorry for her son Saeed, who has never set eyes on his father. She said: 'He asks me all the time where his papa is. 'I make excuses, saying that he's busy working or that his plane is broken, but that one day he will come and give him a hug. 'I just don't understand how a man can have no contact with his son. If I am deported then I will have to start all over again, to get my legal rights acknowledged in the courts of another country.' Ms El Gamal, who was born into a wealthy and influential Egyptian family, met Sheik Ahmed, 56, in Dubai in 2004. She recalls: 'I was having lunch with a girlfriend at the Emirates Towers Hotel. Ahmed was at the next table with some friends and struck up a conversation with us. 'He said he was a businessman and took my phone number before we parted. About 20 minutes later, he called me and asked if my friend and I would join him for dinner that night. 'I said yes because I thought he might be a potential client for my interior design business. I honestly didn't know who he was.' She feels angry and betrayed, but most of all sorry for her son Saeed, who has never set eyes on his father . A month after she returned to London, he flew to the capital in his private jet and set about wooing her. 'I had never before felt so attracted to anyone,' she recalls. 'I was enthralled by him. I adored him. I felt in my heart that we were meant to be together. 'He would wake me up with a cup of espresso every morning and even have my toothbrush ready with toothpaste. 'We spent most of our time at his flat in Knightsbridge or on his yacht in Dubai, because he's a very private person.' She basked in the pampered lifestyle afforded by her billionaire lover, who showered her with gifts, including money for a Bentley. 'He loved to surprise me with presents, including a diamond-encrusted Bulgari watch, jewellery, designer bags and couture dresses,' Ms El Gamal said. 'I have a Louis Vuitton crocodile bag that I don't think anyone else in the world has got.' And after Saeed was born in Los Angeles, in April 2008, the sheik married his cousin. 'I never dreamed he would dump me this way,' Ms El Gamal said . She says Sheik Ahmed proposed in 2006. He gave her a £30,000 dowry, as well as money to buy a gold ring with 17 diamonds. Then, in 2007 they took part in a secret Muslim marriage ceremony in his Knightsbridge apartment. He arranged a secret urfi – a traditional form of Islamic marriage officiated by an imam. Two male assistants acted as witnesses. There were no other guests. 'I agreed to all the secrecy because, as a senior royal, he was not allowed to marry someone from outside his country, especially as his first wife,' Ms El Gamal says. 'He promised that after a while we would make it public.' But she was stunned when things began to fall apart after she announced she was pregnant. And after Saeed was born in Los Angeles, in April 2008, the sheik married his cousin. 'I never dreamed he would dump me this way,' Ms El Gamal said. But there was more bad news. When Saeed was two, doctors discovered that he was suffering from Mannose-binding lectin deficiency, a condition that affects the immune system. Sufferers are prone to recurrent infections of the upper respiratory tract. After winning her battle to prove paternity and for maintenance, last week Ms El Gamal, was back in court again, appealing against the deportation order. It is understood she gets £15,000 a month under her financial arrangement with Sheik Ahmed, and she said: 'I'm self-financing and don't cost the country a penny – not even for health care. 'My funding is guaranteed by my ex-husband until our son is 21, so it's not as if I am a burden on the state. Saeed's father pays his medical bills too. Ahmed can ignore me and move on, but to not want to know your only child is beyond me.' The sheik declined to comment.","Nivin El Gamal in legal dispute with Sheik Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum .

"Alcoholics and junkies are getting almost half a billion pounds a year in sickness benefits, shock figures reveal. An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has uncovered the true scale of welfare payouts to addicts, despite repeated attempts by Ministers to crack down on Britain’s benefits culture. It can be revealed today that: . Wasted cash: Alcoholics and drug abusers are receiving welfare payments worth almost half a billion pounds a year (picture posed by model) Last night, Tory MP Nigel Mills, who sits on the Work and Pensions Committee, said: ‘We should be helping them get off their addictions and get into work, not leaving them to be stuck at home, which is not good for them. The better way to spend public money is to help people get past their addictions and get them fit to work rather than paying benefits while they stay addicted.’ Tory MP Tracey Crouch, until recently chairwoman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Alcohol Misuse, said: ‘If addicts are simply given cash with no link to proper treatment and recovery, then nothing will ever change.’ Figures uncovered by this newspaper show there were 1,921,340 people across Britain on sickness benefits – now known as Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) – in 2013-14, receiving annual payments totalling £10.4billion. Of these, 46,810 received the payment mainly because of their alcohol misuse and a further 28,440 had a ‘primary disabling condition’ of drug addiction. The alcoholics received £249.8million in ESA and the drug addicts £156.7 million. On top of this, substance abusers still getting the old Incapacity Benefit last year received £26.3million, and a further £2.2million went on Disability Living Allowance. It means addicts received £435million in sickness benefits in one year. Most will also be entitled to Housing Benefit – up to £400 a week for large families – and a discount on Council Tax. But even this underestimates the true number of addicts receiving sickness benefits, as many will qualify for ESA as a result of having other problems such as mental illness or physical disabilities. More than 75,000 people are signed off work and being paid up to £108 a week in sickness pay – more than jobseekers get – because of conditions related to drink or drug abuse (picture posed by model) Thousands of other addicts who are unemployed but deemed fit to work receive Jobseeker’s Allowance of £72.40 a week. Shockingly, the statistics obtained under Freedom of Information laws reveal that some of the addicts are teenagers. There were 1,030 alcoholics aged between 18 and 24 receiving ESA, along with 930 drug addicts of the same ages – and 20 aged under 18. The greatest number of alcoholics on sickness benefit live in Glasgow (400), followed by Manchester (290), Edinburgh (250), Birmingham (200) and Bristol (190). Most drug addicts on ESA lived in Bristol (340), followed by Edinburgh (270), Glasgow (200), Bournemouth (150) and Aberdeen (140). Junkies and alcoholics are also entitled to help with housing and council tax bills, as well as NHS rehab and detox treatment . The number of addicts claiming sickness benefit has barely changed despite attempts by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to get people back into work. A Department for Work and Pensions document admits the proportion of alcoholics getting ESA ‘has remained largely unchanged’ while the number of drug addicts in the system has fallen by just 0.5 percentage points. This is despite the supposedly tough Work Capability Assessment, introduced to find out what activities claimants can take part in, as well as to weed out undeserving claimants. The assessments are only meant to help people who have serious conditions that leave them unable to work. One recent case, however, shows that a drinker originally deemed to be simply lazy has been allowed to claim ESA. Court papers seen by The Mail on Sunday show that the 30-year-old lives with his mother in Glasgow and had been paid sickness benefit for eight years when he was told to apply again under the new system. He admitted he had no trouble with physical functions but had ‘no motivation to… get up, get dressed, get washed etc’ and that ‘my mother does almost everything for me’. A nurse who interviewed the unnamed man said he ‘would drink ten to 12 cans of lager daily’ and had ‘anxiety and depression’ as well as ‘alcohol misuse’ for a decade – but added that his minimal activity ‘appears to be through choice rather than illness’. He was initially refused ESA but appealed. In January 2013 a three-judge panel ruled that alcohol dependency did count as a ‘specific disease or bodily or mental disablement’ even if it was ‘self-inflicted’. HM Courts & Tribunals Service confirmed last night that the man has since won a fresh hearing and is now receiving sickness benefit. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘This Government has set out to change the way drug treatment is perceived and delivered - above all prioritising full recovery rather than short-term fixes. ‘There is an increasing rate of people coming out of rehab who have successfully completed treatment and left entirely drug-free - with the latest statistics showing a rise of 15,000 people in England compared to 5 years earlier.’ The DWP added: ‘Having a drug or alcohol addiction does not entitle someone to sickness benefits, but the associated long-term health effects may. ‘We are reforming disability benefits by introducing a new face-to-face assessment and more regular reviews - something missing under the old system. ‘But, ultimately, if a person’s health conditions render them genuinely unable to work, they need to be supported.’","Addicts are getting nearly half a billion pounds a year in sickness benefits .

"A father who doctors ‘gave up’ on following a stroke is now recovering after The Mail on Sunday highlighted his plight. Doctors applied four times to place a ‘do not resuscitate’ order on the medical notes of Paul Scoble, 48, after he suffered the devastating stroke last August. It meant they would not have tried to restart his heart if he had gone into cardiac arrest, and would have left him to die. Lucky: Paul Scoble's daughter Danielle (both pictured) refused to give up after doctors applied four times to place a 'Do Not Resuscitate' order on his medical notes . He was immobile, breathing through a ventilator and largely unable to communicate. Doctors at Basildon Hospital in Essex told Mr Scoble’s children, Danielle and Leon, to prepare for the worst and asked them to ‘seriously consider’ what their father’s life would be like if he did survive, the siblings said. Besides suffering the stroke, Mr Scoble also had two leaky heart valves. The doctors resisted the idea of carrying out an operation to mend them and said the chances of him surviving it were slim. But Danielle and Leon refused to listen and contacted bosses at other hospitals to ask if they would operate. After The Mail on Sunday highlighted their plight in November, medics at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London agreed to operate and he was transferred there. Now, Mr Scoble, who runs a family import business with Danielle and Leon, is off a ventilator, eating and talking. Last night he said: ‘I feel very lucky to be here and I owe my life to my family, friends, The Mail on Sunday and everyone at the Royal Brompton. ‘I am very disappointed at what happened to me at Basildon Hospital and what they put my family through, and I am quite shocked about how far this had to go before I could get the help I needed.’ Mr Scoble, pictured with Danielle, was immobile, breathing through a ventilator and largely unable to communicate after suffering a devastating stroke . Doctors at Basildon Hospital, in Essex, resisted the idea of carrying out an operation to mend Mr Scoble's leaky heart valves . Danielle, 29, said: ‘He is doing brilliantly – a million times better than how he was in Basildon. He is ever so grateful. He feels so lucky to have got out of there and had this operation.’ A Basildon spokesman said: ‘We are pleased that the care we provided for Mr Scoble when he was critically ill enabled him to be transferred to a world-leading centre where he could have this life-saving operation.’ He added: ‘We are conducting a thorough review of Mr Scoble’s care, including feedback from him and his family, to establish where improvements can be made.’","Doctors applied 4 times to place 'do not resuscitate' orders on Paul Scoble .

"These touching - and sometimes hilarious - photos show the lengths three brothers went to to make their mom smile. The MacMillan brothers, led by the eldest, Matt, trawled back through old family photos are recreated the images now they are fully grown. After pulling off the snaps - which look far more bizarre with grown-ups - they compiled them into a gift for their delighted mom, Vickie MacMillan. All grown up: The MacMillan brothers recreated old photographs to surprise their mom - including this snap of the three in the bath . Way back machine: The boys took take after take to mimic their boyish poses from decades ago . Hallowe'en: They trawled local stores to find replica costumes to recreate the childhood scenes . The three even roped in their father for some of the images. He too is showing the difference after several decades, but does look more recognizable than his sons. According to ABC News, the three brothers, from Pennsylvania, got the idea for their project because their mom had asked for calendars as gifts in the past. The images caught the attention of the internet after the brothers posted them on image-sharing forums - resulting in millions of eyes on their childhood memories. A little help: The brothers' father also mucked in for the project, which the boys then posted online . Bit heavier now: This scene outside a church was a bit more difficult to pull of with full-grown men . Speaking to ABC, Matt said: 'We took off work and school for a day, so we could take the pictures without our mom knowing. 'We must have taken about 20 pictures of each scene trying to get the perfect facial expressions and poses.' The result was said to prompt tears of joy in their mother, who said she finds something new to love in the gifts every day. Fun at home: The boys bought bigger versions of their own clothes and tried to bring back their hapless youthful expressions . Party time: Although a properly-sized dinosaur costume was seemingly not available, the boys managed to mostly recreate their costumes here .

"Vince Cable has launched an astonishing attack on George Osborne in a Cabinet meeting by openly mocking the Chancellor’s claim that the UK is outperforming other European economies. The Liberal Democrat Business Secretary stunned last week’s Cabinet by highlighting Mr Osborne’s repeated boast that the British Government could borrow money more cheaply than other European countries – because he claims that the markets back his austerity regime. Cuttingly, Mr Cable said he ‘couldn’t help noticing’ that figures suggested the UK was actually ‘on a par’ with the much-maligned socialist-style French and Italian economies, which Mr Osborne has derided for being debt-laden and uncompetitive. Vince Cable has launched an astonishing attack on George Osborne in a Cabinet meeting by openly mocking the Chancellor’s claim that the UK is outperforming other European economies . One source claimed: ‘When Cable spoke, George looked stormy. There was just the sound of indignant muttering from the Conservatives in the room.’ Mr Cable’s remarks will heighten tensions within the Coalition – already at breaking point with little more than three months to go until the General Election. They will also increase suspicions the Business Secretary is trying to align himself closer to Labour ahead of potential talks on a post-Election Lib-Lab pact, which could see the 71-year-old former Labour Party member finally achieve his ambition to become Chancellor. When Mr Osborne appeared at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, he urged eurozone countries to copy his policy of slashing public spending and cited France and Italy as being in particular need of ‘structural reform’. The Chancellor has repeatedly said in his Budget speeches that because of the strength of the British economy he has been able to borrow money more cheaply than most of our European competitors: the highest rates – known as bond yields – are charged by the City to countries with the greatest chance of going bust. But at the Cabinet meeting, Mr Cable said: ‘I can’t help noticing that the bond yields of France and Italy are now on a par with ours.’ However, sources close to Mr Osborne insisted: ‘There was an exchange, but in it Cable agreed with George that the eurozone economies still pose a destabilising risk to the British economy. In fact, it is one of the few things George and Vince do agree about.’ Osborne (pictured with Cable and Peter Mandelson) is said to have 'looked stormy' when Cable made the remarks . Mr Osborne has repeatedly argued that low UK bond yields represent a pat on the back from investors for his spending cuts. Last week, the yield on ten-year bonds was 1.3 per cent for the UK, compared with 1.5 per cent for Italy and just 0.5 per cent for France. Last night, a senior Conservative source said that Mr Cable had irritated Tory Ministers in recent months by using meetings to praise the performance of the French economy under President Francois Hollande. Like Ed Miliband, Hollande has criticised ‘the economics of austerity’, as practised by Mr Osborne, arguing that Europe needs a ‘different way forward’ to deal with the debt crisis. Mr Cable declined to comment last night.","Vince Cable openly mocked George Osborne during a Cabinet meeting .

"One of Britain's top generals was the subject of a misconduct inquiry just months before he retired, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Lieutenant General Jonathan 'Jacko' Page, 56, a former chief of Special Forces, was accused of inappropriate behaviour by a member of staff. Last night the Army was accused of a cover-up after refusing to disclose details of the complaint, such as whether it was upheld or if it was made by a female – as military sources have indicated to this newspaper. Complaint: Lieutenant General Jonathan 'Jacko' Page (pictured), 56, a former chief of Special Forces, was accused of inappropriate behaviour by a member of staff . In February 2012, Lieut Gen Page was made Commander of Force Development and Training (CFDT) – a two-year desk job based at Army headquarters in Andover, Hampshire. In May the following year he was notified in writing by the Ministry of Defence that he would not receive another job offer once his term as Commander came to an end in February 2014, a decision that effectively terminated his military career. At some point between Lieut Gen Page receiving the MoD letter and his appointment coming to an end, a formal complaint against him was submitted to Army bosses. But the MoD insisted last night it could not provide further information about the case, a stance that has infuriated the Shadow Minister for the Armed Forces, Kevan Jones. He said: 'This case highlights the Army's determination to keep delicate matters in house. There should be greater clarity and the Lieutenant General should be as responsible for his actions as the most junior private soldier, even if at the time the complaint was made he was about to retire. 'At times like these the wagons tend to circle around senior officers, while the Army as an institution has been reluctant for years to have any independent scrutiny, the like of which is standard for any modern organisation or public body.' Secretive: The Army was last night accused of a cover-up after refusing to disclose any information about the complaint made against General Page (file photo) When Lieut Gen Page was approached at his home, in Norfolk, he refused to answer any questions. He said: 'I finished my time. I was appointed for two years [to the CFDT role]. 'I was told when I was appointed that I would do two years.' Asked whether the misconduct allegation was made by a female colleague, he replied: 'I have nothing to say, thank you.' Lieut Gen Page served with the Parachute Regiment during the Falklands War. He later commanded the SAS before leading the Joint Force Headquarters.","Army refused to disclose details of complaint against General Jonathan Page .

"The Mail on Sunday makes public for the first time this exclusive image of a key meeting that World Cup bidding whistleblower Phaedra Almajid says was the start of Qatar 2022’s strategy to set up an alliance with the Spain-Portugal 2018 bid team for their mutual benefit in the bidding process. It was taken by Almajid, who was integral in her then role within the bid team to arranging this meeting in October 2009, one of many stops on a global tour designed to win support and make alliances to help Qatar’s cause. Bid CEO Hassan Al-Thawadi’s father had been a Qatari diplomat in Spain when Al-Thawadi was young; Al-Thawadi had good connections within Spanish business if not football and Almajid says his acquaintanceship with well-connected local businessman Jaime Fluxa was vital. The Qatari delegation had flown into Spain the night before the photo was taken and were staying at the luxury Gran Melia Fenix hotel, where top rooms cost £2,500 a night. They were at the meeting, one of series of engagements with Real Madrid officials over three days, to talk about possible ‘strategic relationships’ between Qatar and Real Madrid — and to lobby for an introduction to the most powerful man in Spanish football, FIFA ExCo member Angel Maria Villar Llona. Among those who met with the Qatari group were Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, executive director Jose Angel Sanchez, and director of strategic planning Ivan Bravo. Villar Llona has close ties across Spanish football, and South America, and Qatar 2022’s strategy paid off when he met senior Qatar officials, although not on this trip, and, Almajid says, agreed to form a vote-swap alliance. FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced that Qatar will host the 2022 World Cup . ‘That was THE point of this particular trip to Spain,’ Almajid told the Mail on Sunday. ‘To get to Villar Llona. To set up this alliance.’ Spain and Qatar have always denied any vote-swap collusion. Neither have responded to questions on the matter. The Qatar bid team’s travels subsequently took them to Malaysia in November 2009, then South Africa. They then announced former Argentina striker Gabriel Batistuta as a bid ambassador, and, Almajid says, they used him as a link to senior executives in Argentina, where there was another ExCo voter. In December 2009 the bid team were in Abu Dhabi, meeting Egypt’s ExCo voter Hany Abo Rida. Then in January the Qatar 2022 team sponsored the annual congress of the African Confederation (CAF) in Angola, where Qatar’s own FIFA ExCo voter, Mohamed bin Hammam made his first official appearances as a Qatar 2022 figurehead. By February, they were back in Spain, in Barcelona, announcing Barca manager Pep Guardiola as a bid ambassador. On that trip, senior Qatar official Tariq Al Naama met Villar Llona. ‘The vote deal was then sealed,’ Almajid says. World Cup bidding whistleblower Phaedra Almajid accused Qatar of corruption during bidding process . Judge Hans-Joachim Eckert cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing during the bidding process . Chairman of the ethics committee Michael Garcia disowned the summary of his report into corruption . In October 2010, Villar Llona passed a note to Bin Hammam at an ExCo meeting in Zurich. A brief FIFA probe into alleged collusion, just weeks before the December 2010 vote on the 2018 and 2022 hosts, had found ‘insufficient’ evidence to take any action. The note read: ‘Congratulations, vamos a ganar’ — or ‘Congratulations, we are going to win.’ FIFA president Sepp Blatter told the BBC in February 2011: ‘I’ll be honest, there was a bundle of votes between Spain and Qatar.’ But both nations have always denied there was any vote pact. A Qatar 2022 spokesman said: ‘We have always been confident of our position and stand by the integrity and quality of our bid. We continue to focus on delivering a historic World Cup in the Middle East.’ Villar Llona declined to be involved at all in Michael Garcia’s investigation into alleged corruption in the 2018 and 2022 process. Almajid, in the room on many occasions as Qatar sought to land sport’s greatest event, is convinced their path to an unlikely victory began in the photo on this page. ‘In my mind there is no question about it,’ she says.

"The identity of Mr WH has been puzzled over for centuries after it appeared in Shakespeare's book of sonnets . The identity of the man Shakespeare's book of sonnets was dedicated to  - a enigma that has puzzled scholars for centuries - may now finally have been established. The first edition of Shakespeare's sonnets, published in 1609, were dedicated to a 'Mr W H', whose identity has never been proven - leading to claims it could have been a male lover. But an American researcher has now uncovered evidence to suggest he was not, in fact, a male lover or nobleman, but a recently deceased friend of the sonnets' publisher. Inscribed in the first published edition of the sonnets is a dedication to the man, whose identity has been subjected to fierce debate for centuries. The message reads: 'To the only begetter of these ensuing sonnets Mr W H. All happiness and that eternity promised by our ever-living poet wisheth the well-wishing adventurer in setting forth.' It ends with the letters 'TT' - believed to be the mark of the sonnets' publisher, Thomas Thorpe. The Guardian reported researcher Geoffrey Caveney has now found evidence linking the initials to William Holme, who was an associate of Thorpe's. The two were both publishing apprentices in London, had theatre connections and came from prominent families in Chester. Mr Caveney said evidence for his conclusions included that Holme died two years before the sonnets were published and it would have been an insult to refer to an aristocrat as 'Mr' - ruling out Mr W. H's identity as a nobleman. His theory, that it was a tribute to someone deceased, would also explain the spiritual theme of the message. Researcher Geoffrey Caveney has now found evidence linking the dedication 'Mr W H', whose identity has never been proven, to William Holme, an associate of Shakespeare's publisher . Mr Caveney said: Nobody was aware that there was [also] a publisher of that name who had died in 1607,' said Caveney. 'Seeing the dedication as a memorial makes a lot of sense,' according to the Guardian. Throughout the centuries since the sonnets were published, speculation about Mr W. H's identity has varied wildly. The most likely candidates were often thought to have been his friends Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, or William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke. Oscar Wilde explored a different theory, writing a fictional 1889 story about whether it could be a cross-dressing boy actor called Willie Hughes - and the same person as the 'fair youth' of the sonnets. That could also help explain punning references to the name 'Will', it was claimed. A rare copy of William Shakespeare's First Folio (pictured), the first ever compilation of the Bard's plays, was uncovered in a provincial library in northern France last year . The world's most famous playwright has long caused controversy among literary scholars. Last year, a new debate broke out between some of the world's top Shakespeare experts over whether the playwright's sonnets prove he was attracted to men. Sir Brian Vickers, a visiting professor at University College London, began the row by condemning a book review which suggested Sonnet 116 appears in a 'primarily homosexual context'. In a letter to the Times Literary Supplement, he said the claim was 'anachronistic' because scholars now accept there were forms of rhetoric that allowed men to express love without implying sexual attraction. But the most enduring debate about the Bard is whether or not the playwright wrote everything that has been attributed to him. Doubts have surrounded Shakespeare's authorship for 150 years, with Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe and Edward de Vere named as the likely writers of his sonnets and plays. And recently, Shakespeare's well-delivered lines have even been blamed for creating a painful stigma for millions of people suffering skin disease. Researchers from Nottingham, Leicester and Derby, analysed Shakespeare’s language and found that it reflected the Elizabethan obsession with perfect, unmarked, pale skin. One of the most graphic examples occurs when King Lear insults his scheming daughter Goneril, declaring: 'Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle'.","Identity of Shakespeare's 'Mr WH' has been puzzled over for centuries .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are to hire a maternity nurse to help them care for their second child. Despite opting not to have one when Prince George was born, The Mail on Sunday has learned that William and Kate will follow Royal tradition this time. Aides are understood to have enquired at the London-based Norland Agency and Royal Nannies about a full-time maternity nurse for at least three months after the birth. Happy family: The Duke (right) and Duchess of Cambridge (left) opted not to have a maternity nurse when Prince George (pictured) was born . Although the Duchess has a full-time nanny for 18-month-old George, she wants additional help for her second child, which is due in April. Kate is said to be keen to resume her charity work 'as quickly as possible'. A live-in maternity nurse carries out all duties relating to the care of mother and baby in the first few weeks after a birth. A source said: 'Kate and William loved the early weeks with Prince George but it was hard work and the sleepless nights took their toll. Kate especially was exhausted.' In September 2014, the Duke and Duchess began to make arrangements to hire a professional in the early stage's of their second child's birth. The Royal couple relied largely on their family members for help following the birth of Prince George. A friend of the Prince and Princess said at the time:  'There is a nanny annex and a guest suite with plenty of space for Kate's family... Kate and William plan to go to their own family home after the birth.' A spokesman for the couple declined to comment.

"Two taxpayer-funded New York defense attorneys have sparked outrage after appearing in an online rap video that urges black people to kill police officers - and allowing it to be filmed in their offices. The video, dubbed 'Hands Up', shows black men holding guns to the head of a white actor dressed as an NYPD cop, and features the lyric: 'For Mike Brown and Sean Bell, a cop got to get killed'. It also depicts a grief-stricken mother walking into The Bronx Defenders's offices on 161st Street, where she is comforted by an attorney. Another lawyer at the firm features later in the footage. Shortly after the video was posted online in December last year, it was brought to the attention of police and City officials. They launched an investigation into the attorneys' roles in the footage.

"One of Britain's longest married couples have been wed over seven decades without a single row. Since marrying in 1941, Ernie and Renie Hills from Tiverton, Devon, have survived Hitler's Blitz, a bout of tropical thrombosis and a stint in an iron lung. Not only that, but the husband and wife endured it all without arguing once. Scroll down for video . Ernie and Renie Hills from Tiverton, Devon, have been married since 1941 and claim that they haven't argued once in seven decades . The couple believe that if everyone used their fail-safe technique - talking things through - then there would be no more war in the world. Ernie, 97, an ex toolmaker and serviceman-come-milkman, and Renie, 93, who worked in London's factories during the Second World War, first met when she was pushing a bike near her home. A man walking nearby shouted out, 'Oi, would you like to hold me up like that?' She said: 'That was it, we were together after that.' Ernie added: And you know what? We've never argued since that day,' he explained. The couple on their wedding day at St Thomas Church in Dagenham, Essex, in 1941 . The couple say the key to such a long marriage was mutual discussion, a clear understanding of one another's needs. Speaking to the Exeter Express And Echo, Renie said: 'I take no notice - if he's a bit up I throw it away - throw it to the wind.' If there's a disagreement, the couple sit down and talk it out instead of raising their voices. She said: 'I say what's my view and he says what's his view and we argue it out like that. 'We're married - he's mine and I'm his and that's how we look at it. 'We talk things over.' Renie in Dagenham in 1944 (left) and Ernie in Kenya in 1943 (right . Ernie added: 'There's no need to argue. 'If we find anything we're going to argue over we discuss it. 'If people talked things over there'd be no wars on earth.' Ernie, who served in the Second World War, contracted tropical thrombosis, a life threatening condition, while serving in Mombasa, Kenya and was rushed home. Renie was terrified for Ernie's life, but thankfully he eventually recovered. She said: 'It was as if the heavens opened up for me on that day and it's like they've never closed since.' Ernie and Renie credit their long marriage with the fact that they always talk things through, instead of rowing . Ernie cheated death once again when he had a lump removed from his lung, causing him to spend weeks in an iron lung. And later on in the war, the couple narrowly escaped being hit by a bomb after the family dog  detected a dropped bomb that hadn't yet gone off. One night, while they were playing cards in Renie's mother's home, their dog suddenly leapt up and sought refuge under an iron-framed piano and whimpered. Ernie said: 'Somehow the dog knew a bomb had been dropped, so we all went and hid under the stairs.'","Ernie and Renie Hills from Tiverton, Devon, have been married since 1941 .

"Chuka Umunna (pictured) said the system would be 'fairer' than tuition fees and would be introduced 'in the medium term' if Labour returns to power . The Government’s decision to triple tuition fees will end up costing students and taxpayers more money – because half the loans will never be repaid, new figures have revealed. Ministers increased the cap on student fees from £3,000 to £9,000 a year to fill the hole in university funding left by government cuts to the higher education budget. But, because student debs are written off after 30 years, 49.5 per cent will never be recouped, meaning the scheme will cost the government £2.5billion a year more than ministers claimed, House of Commons library figures show. At the same time average graduate debts have doubled from £20,000 in 2010 to £43,500. It comes after Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, revealed Labour would introduce a 'graduate tax' on the earnings of those who go to university to replace tuition fees. Mr Umunna said the system would be 'fairer' than tuition fees and would be introduced 'in the medium term' if Labour returns to power. The National Union of Students proposed an extra tax of between 0.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent of their income above £15,000, for a period of 20 years, with the highest earners paying higher rates. Labour is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000. In 2011, it announced the policy as it sought to win over disaffected former Liberal Democrat voters angered by Nick Clegg reneging on a pledge to scrap fees and signing up to Coalition plans to allow institutions to charge up to £9,000 a year – triple the amount students paid previously. The £6,000 cap is expected to be included in Labour's general election manifesto, but it is not clear how the party intends to meet such an expensive commitment. Previously, Labour has suggested that it might pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks or with higher rates of interest for better-off students. The party may also be forced to restrict the cut in fees to certain types of courses such as technical degrees, leaving other students to keep on paying the current cost. Mr Umunna, who is responsible for higher education policy, said introducing a full-scale graduate tax 'as soon as possible is my priority'. Ed Miliband’s campaign chief Lucy Powell attacked the decision to increase tuition fees. She said: ""Ed has long said that he thinks that the current system [of tuition fees] needs to change and a report out this morning, figures we’ve gained from the House of Commons library this morning show that the new funding arrangement, the increased tuition fees to £9,000 a year is actually costing the taxpayer more because half of those loans that people are having to take out won’t be repaid. ‘So we’ve got young people leaving university with £30,000, £40,000 worth of debt. Nearly half of them won’t actually repay those loans so it’s costing the taxpayer more anyway.’ The decision to hike tuition fees is one of the most controversial decisions of the Coalition. Nick Clegg, appearing on the comedy show The Last Leg on Friday admitted it had given him sleepless nights. However he also continued to defend the decision, adding: 'I'm not Prime Minister so I can't do what I want.' Cost cutting: Labour is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000 . The Lib Dems have pointed to figures showing the gap between the number of rich and poor students wanting to go on to higher education had fallen since 2010. Business Secretary Vince Cable has described the new system as 'better, affordable and fair'. He said: 'We have paid a price for this policy more than any other party. But the success of these reforms, with more students from disadvantaged backgrounds applying to university than ever before, shows it was a price worth paying. 'Regardless of family circumstances, all students can now obtain university level education as long as they meet academic requirements. This is a good legacy.' The figures, from university admissions service Ucas, show 21 per cent of 18-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds in England applied this year. Overall, the richest 18-year-olds in the UK are 2.4 times more likely to want to go to university than the poorest. But in 2006, when Labour was in power, the wealthiest were 3.7 times more likely to want to apply.","Decision to triple fees will end up costing students and taxpayers more .

"A pregnant Florida woman has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for her part in a 2012 car crash that left another pregnant woman dead. Rosa Rivera Kim, 37, of Plantation, entered guilty pleas to the two counts of DUI manslaughter she faced in the death of 26-year-old Alanna DeMella and the unborn child she was carrying. DeMella, seven months pregnant at the time of the crash, reportedly planned to name the boy Joshua. Rosa Rivera Kim, 37, of Plantation, entered guilty pleas to the two counts of DUI manslaughter she faced in the death of 26-year-old Alanna DeMella and the unborn child she was carrying. DeMella was in town for a two-day marriage conference with husband Michael (right) at the Calvary Chapel after winning the trip and flying down from their home in Wodburn, Mass . DeMella was killed when Kim drunkenly smashed her car into a poolside cabana at Riverside Hotel in Fort Lauderdale, The Sun Sentinel reports. DeMella was in town for a two-day marriage conference with husband Michael at the Calvary Chapel after winning the trip and flying down from their home in Wodburn, Mass. Michael was in the restroom at the time of the accident. He suffered only minor injuries. Before she was sentenced, Kim gave a gut wrenching testimony expressing sorrow for her actions. Her blood alcohol had been 0.24 at the time of the accident. That's three times more than the legal limit. DeMella, seven months pregnant at the time of the crash, reportedly planned to name the boy Joshua . Once released, Kim must still serve another 15 years probation during which she will be required to clock 15 years of community service per year . 'All I can say is I'm so sorry,' said a weeping Kim. 'If I could do anything to bring them back, I would … I would have thrown myself in front of a car if I would have seen that happening.' The mother of three became pregnant again herself five months ago. Kim's baby, set to be delivered via C-section in May, will be turned over to her family as she completes her sentence. DeMella, a schoolteacher, was on her first pregnancy at the time of her death. She had been active in her school's Students Against Drunk Driving chapter and even left a New Year's Party hours before midnight to avoid being in an accident with a drunk driver. The family she left behind seemed to view Kim's pregnancy as nothing more than an attempt to curry favor during the trial. 'It's amazing how one person could make so many poor decisions,' said DeMella's mother Paula Masterson. 'You have tried all avenues to evade responsibility for this crime.' Kim's baby, set to be delivered via C-section in May, will be turned over to her family as she completes her sentence . Even Assistant State Attorney Michael Horowitz called Kim's pregnancy 'appalling and manipulative.' Horowitz was seeking a 20-year sentence. Once released, Kim must still serve another 15 years probation during which she will be required to clock 15 years of community service per year. She has also permanently lost her driver's license. The sentence was ordered to begin immediately.","Rosa Rivera Kim, 37, of Plantation, entered guilty pleas to the two counts of DUI manslaughter she faced in the death of 26-year-old Alanna DeMella and the unborn child she was carrying .

"Labour has promised not to use any pictures of the Prime Minister in election posters– in a bid to stop the campaign turning into a presidential-style run off between David Cameron and Ed Miliband. The party said it would not use negative personal attacks on Mr Cameron – and would focus on policies instead of personalities. It comes as the Tories attempt to use the 'nightmare' scenario of Mr Miliband becoming Prime Minister to scare voters off electing Labour. Scroll down for video . The Tories released an election poster last week suggesting Ed Miliband was preparing to make a deal with the SNP and Sinn Fein . In a poster released last week, Mr Miliband is pictured outside Number 10 with the SNP' Alex Salmond and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, under the slogan: 'Your worst nightmare just got even worse.' Labour's election strategist Douglas Alexander said the Conservatives were preparing to spread 'fear and smear'. The image was later rebranded by the Conservatives with the slogan: 'Fire up the Quattro, it's time for change.' But, in a message to party members, the shadow foreign secretary said Labour would not try to match the Tory attack posters. He wrote: 'The Tories have now bought up hundreds of billboard poster sites on high streets across the country for the months of March and April to run their negative personalised adverts. 'It already seems clear that in their campaign the Tories intend to spread falsehood, fear and smear. 'They will seek to avoid open debate and scrutiny. The Tories will dig deep into their donors' pockets - and plumb new depths - in their desperation to cling on in government.' A Labour attack poster  during the 2010 election campaign accused David Cameron of wanting to take Britain back to the 1980s, using an image from the TV show Life on Mars . The Labour election poster backfired when the Tories released their own mocked-up version, with the slogan: 'Fire up the Quattro. It's time for change' A spokesman told the BBC that focusing on 'issues, not personalities'. Labour's pledge on posters follows the 2010 election campaign, in which it used Mr Cameron's face on a number of billboards and also online.

"The Super Bowl weekend episode of Saturday Night Live took on the two biggest news stories of the week in their cold open - the Super Bowl and Storm Juno. The show opened with a talk show hosted by Seattle Seahawks stars Richard Sherman (played by Jay Pharoah) and Marshawn Lynch (played by Keenan Thompson), in which Lynch said little to nothing, repeating the phrase, ' Thank you for asking me to the first few questions asked of him.' Talk then turned to Sunday's game and, of course, Deflategate, which the men also referred to as 'Ballgazi aka the e-ball-a crisis.' Scroll down for video .

'Shout out to dreadlocks footballs,' said Thompson as Lynch, one of the few things he said during the segment. The Seahawks and there influx of new fans also got poked fun at, with a member of the team's backing band saying; 'I've been a diehard fan since the beginning ... of 2013.' They also called Mayor Bill de Blasio a 'punk a**' for his reaction to Storm Juno . Then talk turned to Storm Juno, and how Mayor Bill de Blasio shut down the city for what ultimately amounted to just a few inches of snow. 'De Blasio's a punk a** mayor,' said Pharoah as Sherman.

"Campaigners protesting about six blocks of student flats which are a 'horrible eyesore' on a city skyline are urging authorities to slice off the top floors of the buildings at an estimated cost of £30million. Protesters, including author Mark Haddon, have described the Castle Mill development near Port Meadow, Oxford, as a 'terrible mistake' and claim it blocks the view of the city's famous spires. The flats, which are used as graduate housing by the University of Oxford, have been marred by controversy since development began in 2012. The Castle Mill development, which consists of student housing used by the University of Oxford, has been marred in controversy since building began in 2012. Campaigners claim it is a 'horrible eyesore' on skyline . After being built by Frankham Consultancy Group on behalf of the University, at a cost of £24million, the Save Port Meadow group was set up to protest against their existence. Over the last two years, it has campaigned against the development, claiming there were 'exceptionally low levels' of public awareness of the initial planning application and criticising it for 'hampering' the city's skyline from the ancient meadow. The Castle Mill development has not only received criticism for its location, but also for its design. Former Planning Minister Nick Boles MP previously described the buildings as 'some of the worst he had seen'. Speaking in January last year, he said: 'I think that this design is possibly one of the worst designs I've seen of any set of new buildings to go up in the last 10 years. 'Frankly, the only thing it reminds me of is the Maze Prison.' The development was also nominated for the Carbuncle Cup in 2013 , which is an annual award by Building Design for 'the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months.' In its nomination, the development was described as 'a deeply unimaginative and impoverished design which would lower the spirits whatever its setting, but on the edge of one of central England's most important and ancient landscapes, it is an outrage.' The saga surrounding the Castle Mill development began in late 2011 when the University of Oxford submitted the planning application to Oxford City Council. As part of a consultation document for the development - which was built on a brownfield site near Oxford railway station - planning consultants stated that it would 'not be visible from the majority of Port Meadow'. Over the last two years, the Save Port Meadow campaign group has protested against the development, criticising the University for building on the ancient meadow. Pictured: The meadow before the development . Toby Porter (pictured), founder of the Save Port Meadow campaign group, has welcomed the University's Congregation meeting and supports the motion of reducing the height of the buildings to be in line with trees . At the time, city council planning officers stated that the development was not in an environmentally-sensitive location and therefore no Environmental Impact Statement (EIA) was required. Development began in summer 2012, and building work soon drew attention from residents and local business owners who were surprised at the height of the flat blocks. An online petition was drawn up to protest the height of the buildings and quickly gathered thousands of signatures. In March the following year, the Council for the Protection of England (CPRE) issued a High Court challenge, challenging the council's decision not to request an Environmental Impact Statement as part of the planning process. It prompted the University to announce it would commission independent planning consultants to carry out a retrospective Environmental Impact Statement. The assessment was published towards the end of last year with three options: To change the appearance of the building externally, carry out height reduction on a couple of the buildings or reduce the height of all the buildings to the treeline of Port Meadow. The University has now confirmed that the institution's 'Congregation' - its sovereign body, which consists of academic staff - will now vote on a formal motion to reduce the height of the blocks. The motion will be discussed on February 10, and could be followed by a postal vote. Toby Porter, founder of the Save Port Meadow campaign group, has welcomed the Congregation meeting and supports the motion of reducing the height of the buildings. Protesters against the development include author and Oxford graduate Mark Haddon, who wrote The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time . He told MailOnline: 'Normally in planning cases, you have up to three months after a planning application to lodge an appeal but in this case nobody really knew the application had been planted. 'Nobody was aware of the buildings until they started going up in September 2012, by which time the three-month period for a legal challenge to the planning permission had long passed. 'This was one of the many unusual things about the case so we started looking into it and what we uncovered was an extremely unsatisfactory planning process. 'The costs of rectifying the building are very high. The University should have acted much earlier, when it realised a terrible mistake had been made and when it became obvious that almost everyone complained about the buildings - not just because of the impact but that they had no idea planning permission had been applied for.' Mr Porter admitted that it would cause upheaval to students living in the building if work was carried out to reduce the height, but said this should have been thought about at the beginning of the planning process. He said: 'I don't think the University is facing any easy options but what price do you put on its accountability to get things sorted. 'I recognise that there are no easy choices now. The idea of spending the money on buildings that have already gone up is crazy and I can fully understand the view that there are other things the University could spend the money on. 'But the trouble is that it all comes down to the fact that thousands of people have had their experiences of a natural heritage site ruined for the 40-year lifetime of these buildings without them ever having had a say in it. 'Through their own incompetence the University managed to achieve this extraordinary outcome, this messy development that has had a huge impact. 'I don't think it was deliberate, I think it was incompetence. 'The people making this decision on February 10 now have a proper moral decision. 'They messed up royally and managed to have this extraordinary situation, and if they vote not to do it, then the public are the ones who suffer. ' Mr Haddon, the author of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time and a graduate of Oxford University's Merton College, agreed that a top floor of each of the buildings should be removed. He told The Sunday Times: 'The Castle Mill development is a horrible eyesore. We all understand the need for more housing, but the development was an abuse of the planning process. 'I support the campaign to remove a floor.' The decision on whether the buildings will be reduced in height will be discussed on February 10 . The University said in a statement that its focus throughout the development has been the best interests of its students and the city. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'We followed due planning process and built much-needed accommodation on a brownfield site on a former railway siding. 'Castle Mill has now been occupied for nearly a-year-and-a-half, home to more than 300 graduate students, some with young families. 'At the same time we have relieved pressure on Britain's most un-affordable housing market. 'Independent experts have reported that Castle Mill, with the mitigation measures we propose, delivers clear benefits to the city. 'The resolution before Congregation would undo these benefits. All 300 students would have to leave for at least a year and 38 flats, including family units, would be lost permanently. 'There would be knock-on damage to the city's hard-pressed property market. 'The total cost of going down this route, according to independent experts, is £30million - more than the flats cost to build (£24million). 'The proposal is strongly opposed by the Student Union precisely because of the harm it would do.' Oxford City Council confirmed it had commissioned and published an independent report by planning expert, Vincent Goodstadt, on the planning and environmental issues surrounding the development. A council spokesman told MailOnline: 'The Goodstadt Review concluded that the planning permission was valid and that the necessary information was provided to the planning committee in taking its decision. 'The report included a recommended action plan which has been accepted and implemented in full by the council.' The council spokesman also confirmed that the authority met the statutory requirements for consultation and said the University did undertake public consultation. However, he added: 'The council has accepted that there could have been greater consultation and has changed some of its procedural arrangements in line with the Goodstadt Review recommendations on best practice.' He concluded that the council 'has not yet taken a view on the adequacy of the latest proposals.' The University's Congregation will now meet to formally discuss the height reduction motion on February 10.","Campaigners want top floors of six student flat blocks to be removed .

"This is the moment when a Spanish bullfighter attempted a move more akin to that of an American wrestler, when he elbowed a bull between the eyes during a fight in Medellin, Colombia. Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza, considered the best rejoneador - bullfighter on horseback - in the world,  was seen making the unusual move as he took on a large bovine during a bullfighting festival at La Macarena bullring in Colombia's second largest city. Rejoneo is a form of bullfighting originally practiced in Portugal and Spain where the bull is fought entirely on horseback. Scroll down for video . Unusual move: Spanish bullfighter Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza elbows a bull in the horns during a bullfighting festival in Medellin, Colombia . Just like classic bullfighting, reonejo has three stages, known as tercios. In classic bullfighting the three stages often involves picadors (horsemen) and banderilleros (lancemen) as well as the matador, but in rejoneo, the rejoneador performs all stages of the fight himself. A rejoneador will often use four different horses during one bullfight, one for the three stages and one parade horse for the initial ceremony. Although many argue that bullfighting is a brutal bloodsport, bordering on animal cruelty and torture, its fans call it an artform, claiming the bulls used for fighting lead better lives than other cattle. The practice is a traditional spectacle in Spain and Portugal, and spread to Hispanic American countries, including Colombia, through colonisation. These images emerge just weeks after a mob killed a bull with machetes, rocks, knives and sticks during a bullchasing festival in a northern Colombia.

"For more than a decade of his life, Lloyd Johnson had doctors baffled over what was causing his incessant sleepiness. Convinced his tiredness was in his head, due to laziness or simply an imbalance in his vitamin levels, the now 28-year-old has spent the last 15 years battling multiple alarm clocks in an effort just to drag himself out of bed in the morning. Three years ago after years of doctor's visits, misdiagnoses and an emotional battle coming to terms with his struggles, Lloyd was diagnosed with 'idiopathic hypersomnia', an incredibly rare sleep disorder. Lloyd Johnson, 28, has a rare condition called idiopathic hypersomnia . For more than a decade of his life doctors were baffled by his mystery illness which was causing him to sleep all the time . A drug called Flumazenil allows him to function normally for six weeks at a time, but forces him to go without for the following two months . 'It’s when you sleep more than 10 hours a day on a regular basis and they've ruled out all the other causes like narcolepsy and drug addiction,' Lloyd told Daily Mail Australia. 'During the day you’re what they call sleep drunk, you’re living in a fog. 'When you’re living it, you don’t realise how much it takes just to be a normal human being. 'I’m there, the lights are on but nobody’s home,' he revealed. Growing up in the suburbs of Perth in Western Australia, Lloyd always had issues with one of his hips, problems so severe it saw him undergo a number of hip surgeries before he even reached his early teens. 'As a teenager we always thought my problem was related to my hip problems... We always thought it was pain related problem not a sleep-related problem,' the 28-year-old revealed. 'When I got really bad when I was about 25 I went back I realised when I looked back I had so many symptoms that were consistent with hypersomnia,' Lloyd added. Lloyd - once he made a miraculous recovery in his early teens - was once an active young man with a passion for exercise, who spent his time training for and competing in triathlons. His high-flying and high-demand job as a trainer of hypnotherapy took him across time zones and around the world and while he spent any spare moment he had sleeping, he convinced himself it was his demanding lifestyle that was causing his insatiable appetite for sleep. Growing up in the suburbs of Perth in Western Australia, Lloyd always had issues with one of his hips, problems so severe it saw him undergo a number of his surgeries before he even reached his early teens . Lloyd - once he made a miraculous recovery in his early teens - was once an active young man with a passion for exercise, who spent his time training and competing in triathlons . But a motorbike accident when he was in Chiang Mai in Thailand was a 'wake-up call' 'A lot of it I just sort of blamed myself, I thought oh I must be eating too many carbs, I must have some sort of vitamin or mineral deficiency,' Lloyd continued. 'When I was not well and no one could figure out what was going on there was a lot of unhappiness and despair.' When he was particularly flat after months on end of travelling, Lloyd's mother suggested he take an extended holiday after he was diagnosed with glandular fever in 2012. As a big believer in the power of the mind and natural remedies he spent six months in Chiang Mai in northern Thailand accessing age-old treatments, but nothing worked. A motorbike accident served as a 'wake-up call' for Lloyd and he headed back home to Australia to try Western treatments. 'If I had any idea my brain was as impaired as it is I never would have been driving,' he said. Having tried everything from amphetamines to ritalin - commonly used in the treatment of ADHD, and being diagnosed with a plethora of things from glandular fever and chronic fatigue to depression it was a relief when Lloyd was finally told he had idiopathic hypersomnia. But hope faded quickly when he discovered how little anyone knew about the condition, and the lack of available treatments. 'There was depression on a whole another level when I realised I had something but no treatments were working,' Lloyd said . Lloyd said among the things he misses most is being able to jump on his bike and go for a ride . He believes the condition first appeared when he was younger and if diagnosed earlier would be less severe . However a few years ago there was light at the end of the tunnel when a very rare and phenomenally expensive drug he had heard about was available close to home. 'I don’t want to spend the rest of my life in bed.' However a few years ago there was light at the end of the tunnel when a very rare and phenomenally expensive drug he had heard about was available close to home. 'The drug is really expensive and it supposed to be super rare and used for people coming off sleeping pill addictions,' Lloyd said. 'I found next to nothing online, but I found this clinic in Subiaco which is like ten minutes from my house where it was available. 'I called and said ‘I’m not a drug addict but..""' Lloyd laughed. After speaking to a researcher and receiving a call from the doctors who were fascinated by his rare condition Lloyd tried a drug called Flumazenil. When he received his first dose, Lloyd was at a very low point. But the immediate impact the drug had on his wellbeing was undeniable. 'I had this huge grin on my face and it’s like this fog was gone,' he recalled. At that point I was so depressed. I’d tried all of the anti-depressants and then went on to trying mood stabilisers.' Within a week of being on the drug his moods had improved, his sleep was regular and he felt 'normal' again. The 28-year-old remembers being incredibly tired very often from a very young age . Lloyd was once an active young man with a passion for exercise, who spent his time training for and competing in triathlons . Through his battle with idiocratic hypersomnia Lloyd created Living With Hypersomnia, a community for people who suffer from the condition . But the catch is the drug is only effective for six weeks at a time, at which point Lloyd has to have two months off the medication to reset his system. ‘The Flumazenil is like night and day for me,' he said. Through his battle with idiocratic hypersomnia Lloyd created a website with his skills acquired during his computer science degree. Living with Hypersomnia is a community for people suffering from the condition, with around 2000 members worldwide, some of which are doctors and researchers. 'When I was learning about it, there wasn't even a Wikipedia page,' Lloyd revealed. 'There's a doctor in the group who actually wrote the page.' He hopes that through this forum and also his YouTube page, he can help others who are battling the condition, or may not have even been diagnosed yet. 'What I'm really hoping is there's going to be people reading this who will go to their doctors and ask questions. His high-flying and high-demand job as a trainer of hypnotherapy took him across time zones and around the world wearing him out . Now his involvement with the hypersomnia community helps he and all those involved keep positive and share any new information . 'Sleepiness isn't just laziness, and there are lots of treatments that are available.' When he is at his best, Lloyd manages an average of nine hours sleep a day and tried to do as much as he can with his time. 'When I’m medicated I do as much as I can, I really love my photography and I do a bit of website stuff. 'I’ve still be clinging to this idea that I’ll be able to get to “normal”,' he continued. ‘It’s like I've lost the ability to trust in my own ability’. But there is hope that through the right balance of Flumazenil paired with another medication might be able to give him the right balance. 'The doctors in Perth are working with me to try and find a medicine that will help in those two months and we've tried a couple of tablets and some of those have showed promise,' Lloyd said. 'I’m just really grateful for a ll the people out there' he said of his Living with Hypersomnia community. 'I know what’s wrong with me now but there’s a lot of people out there who don’t. 'There’s treatments that help, there's people who get on those and they work,' he said.

"It was enough to leave the middle classes choking on their focaccia (well, if they'd had any to hand). A power cut left hundreds of Ocado customers without their online shopping at the weekend. Around 1,700 were told their groceries, mainly from Waitrose, had been cancelled or delayed – some were even warned their Ocado van would not arrive until 3.30am. Many complained that their weekend lunches and dinner parties had been ruined by a lack of such essentials as pork belly or pistachios. Jennifer Skillen, of Gloucestershire, posted a picture of Ocado avocados that were brown inside and wrote: 'I am rarely disappointed with Ocado but these avocados clearly didn't read 'ripen at home' on the label!' The problems began on Friday when, according to Ocado drivers, a power cut at a distribution centre caused orders to be delayed. An Ocado spokesman later attributed the delays to a faulty microchip. Shoppers soon went on Twitter to vent their frustration. Belinda Moore, a communications director, wrote: 'You are kidding me! Whole delivery cancelled. There's not a snowflake in miles of London. So unimpressed.' She added: 'Can't wait to get home, get the kids to bed and then spend two hours doing the food shop.' Sandra Oliver was told to expect a delay of five hours before it was eventually cancelled.

"This is the moment a convicted paedophile was snared by an internet vigilante group after he travelled 300 miles thinking he was about to meet a 14-year-old schoolgirl for sex. Roger Lee, 45, who already had a previous conviction for sex with a 12-year-old, made the trip from Wiltshire to Newcastle believing he was going to meet the girl on the city's quayside. But when he arrived he was confronted by members of the group Dark Justice, who caught him on camera and passed the information, including the messages he had sent, to the police. Paedophile Roger Lee who has been jailed for two years and four months after he was caught by an internet vigilante group, who posed as an underage girl . Lee, of Pewsey in Wiltshire has now been sentenced to two years and four months in jail with an extended three year licence period after appearing at Newcastle Crown Court. Prosecutor Tim Gittin told the court how the vigilantes set up a profile on the chat website Badoo. Lee, who used the name 'ForHire', soon started chatting openly to who he thought was a 14-year-old and sent her graphic pictures of himself. Mr Gittins said: 'He stated he liked young girls and had previously had a relationship with a female aged 12. 'The messages continued over several days and began to become sexually explicit, at the defendant's instigation.' The court heard how Lee also sent three graphic pictures to who he thought was an underage girl and arranged to meet with her while her parents were away. Mr Gittins said the meeting was arranged to take place on the Millennium Bridge on October 9 at 9am. Lee, 45, left, had arranged to meet, who he thought was the 14-year-old on Newcastle's quayside after travelling 300 miles from his home in Wiltshire. But after he was confronted by the group, he ran away, right . He added: 'He was confronted by the two men, who were recording the confrontation on video. 'Not surprisingly, he realised that the game was up and immediately fled the scene. 'The two men reported the matter immediately to the police.' The court heard within hours of being exposed, Lee made a suicide threat which prompted urgent action by police on a nationwide scale to have him found and arrested. He then pleaded guilty to attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming. Judge Sean Morris said: 'You were caught by internet vigilantes, which is the best way of describing them, who pretended to be a female and you entered into a conversation with them on the internet. The vigilantes set up a profile on the chat website Badoo and Lee, who used the name 'ForHire', soon started chatting openly to who he thought was a 14-year-old . 'It soon became apparent what they did was pretend the female was 14. You went for it. 'I am firmly of the view you are a dangerous individual to young children.' Lee must abide by a sexual offences prevention order and sign the sex offenders register for life. The two men behind Dark Justice were at the sentencing hearing to see Lee sent to prison. Speaking afterwards, the pair, who wish to remain anonymous, said they do don't consider themselves as vigilantes but 'concerned citizens of society.' One of the men said: 'Every day we were picking up the paper and it is paedophile, paedophile, paedophile. 'We want to prevent this sort of thing from happening, see a change in the law so that internet users have to identify themselves by credit card, something has to happen. 'This sentence shows what we do works. We continue to do it. Lee was sentenced to two years and four months in prison at Newcastle Crown Court, pictured, after admitting attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming . 'The police reaction to what we are doing has been fine. They don't exactly say ""get on with it"" but they take us seriously. 'Lee was very open during the internet chats, he wasn't scared. I was shocked at how open he was and how keen he was to meet. 'As soon as we saw he had turned up we confronted him and said 'do you think it's appropriate to meet underage girls' and he was off. 'We don't want anyone to get hurt by what we do, we just want to protect people.' Lee's previous convictions include sex with an underage girl and a six year term for robbery. Andrew Walker, defending, said: 'There was no child anywhere near this offending. No one under the age of 18 had anything to do with this case.'","Roger Lee started chatting to who he thought was a girl aged 14 online .

"Rihanna is bold, sexual and doesn't mind showing off her body whether she's on stage or on the red carpet. But now the super-stylish singer, 26, famous for her edgy fashion choices and explicit lyrics, has been given the ultimate accolade by her favourite designer, Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing. The 28-year-old designer told The Telegraph that the Barbadian beauty has the aura and charisma to rival some of the most legendary beauties in history, including Madonna - and Grace Kelly. Scroll down for video . Balmain creative director, Olivier Rousteing, has long considered Rihanna as his most prominent muse . Rihanna, left in 2014, and Grace Kelly, right in 1963, make red carpet appearances more than 50 years apart . Rousteing walked the red carpet at the British Fashion Awards in London on December 1, 2014 . He said: 'She has this aura, this charisma. It's not only sexual. It's something else. She is like a new Grace Kelly, or a Madonna...This woman of the world who represents a new world.' It's an unlikely comparison but Rousteing also believes that the design house's founder, Pierre Balmain, would have approved of the singer and her fearless, over-the-top approach to fashion. He said that Balmain who died in 1982 at the age of 68, loved strong women and women who have something to say. The fashion wunderkind is also famous for befriending the Kardashian clan and casting model Kendall Jenner in his ads and on the catwalk, as well as signing up Kim Kardashian and Kanye West to star in a campaign. Rousteing enjoys harking back to a more opulent age in fashion, saying the industry's biggest moment was the era of the supermodels with famous beauties Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Carla Bruni and Linda Evangelista stalking the catwalk. 'The woman had to come back; the curved woman, and different kinds of body shapes. I don't like skinny girls. I want to represent a real woman, not just a shadow or a ghost,' he said. Rihanna sat front row at the Balmain Spring/Summer 2010 fashion show in Paris, France . Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are also fans - and are often clad - in the Parisian brand . As Rousteing heralds Rihanna as a new icon for our ages, we see how she and Princess Grace compare... and contrast. THEIR LOVE LIVES . Rihanna made headlines for her controversial romance with fellow performer Chris Brown, which ended when he subjected her to a violent beating in 2009. Grace, however, left Hollywood behind to marry Monaco's Prince Rainier III in a real life fairy tale. The chart-topper has yet to have another long-term relationship, while Grace settled in the French principality and had three children before her death in a car crash at the age of 52 in 1982. Rihanna and Chris Brown, left, reunite for a cuddle at the 2013   Grammy Awards, after a turbulent relationship tht ended violently in 2009. Prince Rainier III and Grace Kelly, right, dance in Mallorca on April 23, 1956. THEIR SIGNATURE STYLE . Rihanna, 26, often opts for edgy accessories and leather accents, while Grace was the epitome of timeless elegance - down to her head scarves and Hermes handbags. However, there is something of the Monagesque royal in the singer's style, as she takes Grace's classic hats and cat eye shades but teams them with leather and head-to-toe black, rather than with a pale swing coat and pearls. Rihanna was clearly channelling Grace Kelly's signature style at a meet and greet in New York in 2012. THEIR MOST GLAMOROUS LOOKS . Rihanna dolled up for her hosting duties at The Inaugural Diamond Ball in December 2014 and can definitely hold her own even next to Kelly's opulent, bedazzled ball gown. The Umbrella singer wore a cerise Zac Posen floor-length showstopper with a huge diamond and ruby necklace worthy of the greatest film goddesses. Yet Grace Kelly's sheer elegance and style were so arresting she was even given her own exhibition at the V&A in 2009. Rihanna was the picture of elegance, sporting a Zac Posen ball gown at December's Diamond Ball. Grace Kelly (right) was also known for her elegant dress choices, complete with intricate beading . THEIR FAVOURITE FASHION HOUSES . While Rihanna was named the face of Balmain's spring/summer 2014 campaign, Kelly inspired Paris fashion house, Hermes, to rename one of their signature handbags after her. Rihanna often lends her support to friend Rousteing, while Hermes found their music in the late Kelly . THEIR BIGGEST ACHIEVEMENTS . Rihanna has picked up a slew of music industry awards over the years, including seven Grammys and eight American Music Awards, including her icon award in 2013. Grace Kelly won best actress at the 1955 Academy Awards for her role in The Country Girl although she's now more famous for parts in High Society or as one of Hitchcock's cool blondes, starring in Rear Window and Dial M For Murder. To receive her Icon Awad in 2013, Rihanna opted for barely-there black dress, while Grace Kelly donned Edith Head for her Oscar win in 1955 . Age: 26 . Provenance: Saint Michael, Barbados . Famous romances: Drake, Chris Brown . Most memorable fashion moment: Appearing bra-less in spangled sheer sheath to receive a style icon award at the CFDAs in 2014. Designer Muse: Balmain . Age: Died September 1982 (aged 52) Provenance: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Famous romances: Prince Ranier III of Monaco . Most memorable fashion moment: Her game-changing bridal gown designed by Helen Rose at MGM. Designer Muse: Hermes . THEIR RED CARPET MOMENTS . Rihanna, clad in a custom Adam Selman fishnet dress, which was see-through enough to reveal she wasn't wearing a bra and only the skimpiest of nude knickers, made her most dramatic appearance yet to received the Style Icon Award at the 2014 CFDAs. However ever the fashion plate, Grace Kelly, looked regal in her own fur stole and chic gown in 1963. With a high neckline on her gold brocade gown and fur covering the rest of her body, the movie star showcased her always perfect sense of decorum. Rihanna sparkled in custom Adam Selman at the 2014 CDFA Awards, while Kelly likewise opted for a fur stole in 1963 .","Designer Olivier Rousteing said Rihanna is today's answer to the style icon .

"Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is likely to blame  his 'role model' dead brother at trial to avoid the death penalty. When Tsarnaev's case begins, his lawyers are likely to pin their hopes - and the bombings themselves - on his older brother, Tamerlan: a Golden Gloves boxer, college student, husband and father who also followed radical Islam was named by a friend as a participant in a grisly 2011 triple slaying. 'He was the eldest one and he, in many ways, was the role model for his sisters and his brother,' said Elmirza Khozhugov, the former husband of Tamerlan's sister, Ailina. 'You could always hear his younger brother and sisters say, `Tamerlan said this,' and `Tamerlan said that.' Dzhokhar loved him. Scroll down for videos . Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (left) is likely to blame his 'role model' dead brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right)  at trial to avoid the death penalty . 'He would do whatever Tamerlan would say,' Khozhugov told The Associated Press in the weeks after the bombings. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two homemade pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the iconic race on April 15, 2013. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died days after the bombings following a gun battle with police. Dzhokhar, then 19, was later found hiding in a boat parked in a backyard. Jury selection in his federal death penalty trial is entering its second month. Dzhokhar's lawyers have made it clear they will try to show that he was heavily influenced, maybe even intimidated, by his older brother, into participating in the bombings. If a jury convicts Dzhokhar, its decision on whether to give him life in prison or sentence him to death could depend 'on the extent to which it views Tamerlan Tsarnaev as having induced or coerced his young brother' to help commit the crimes, the defense argued in a court filing. About a decade before the attack, their parents, ethnic Chechens, had moved the family to the U.S. from the volatile Dagestan region of Russia after living in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan. Their father, Anzor Tsarnaev, told The Associated Press the emigrated in part to escape discrimination. The relationship between the two brothers would likely be a key part of the evidence Dzhokhar's lawyers present even if he's convicted, said David Hoose, who represented a Massachusetts nurse who was spared the federal death penalty in the killings of four patients. Proceedings: In this January 5 courtroom sketch, Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, is depicted beside U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr., right, as O'Toole addresses a pool of potential jurors . Under the federal death penalty law, juries deciding on a sentence can consider whether a defendant 'was under unusual and substantial duress,' regardless of whether duress is used as a defense to the charges. If the defense is allowed to use evidence of Tamerlan's possible involvement in the triple murder, they could argue that Dzhokhar was under duress to participate in the marathon bombings, Hoose said. Prosecutors have said that a friend of Tamerlan, Ibragim Todashev, implicated him in the killings of three men in Waltham whose bodies were found sprinkled with marijuana, their throats cut. Todashev was shot to death by an FBI agent after authorities said he charged another investigator with a pole while being questioned about the Tsarnaevs. 'If they can show that the older brother is gruesomely involved in the murders, all the more reason that Dzhokhar felt that not only is he my brother - he is someone not to fool around with. I have to do what he says,'' Hoose said. Tamerlan's high school friends say he appeared to adjust well to his life in America. 'As a student, he was like the rest of us,' said Luis Vasquez, who became friends with Tamerlan soon after he moved to Cambridge. 'You could catch him in the library doing work, socializing in the hallways with people he knew, or at a local pizza shop we could go to during lunch.' About the same time, Tamerlan took up boxing. He was a success, becoming the Golden Gloves heavyweight champion of New England in 2009 and 2010. 'He was a determined guy, in good shape, a strong guy,' said Bob Russo, then-coach for the New England team. 'There was nothing unusual about him.' After he was barred from competing in a national tournament because he was not a U.S. citizen, Tamerlan drifted away from boxing. He took classes at Boston's Bunker Hill Community College for a short time, but dropped out. In 2010, he married Katherine Russell, a Rhode Island woman he met at a nightclub, and the couple had a daughter together. Authorities believe Tamerlan's beliefs became radical during the last few years of his life. In March 2011, Russian officials told the FBI that Tamerlan was a follower of radical Islam. The FBI interviewed Tamerlan, but closed its investigation several months later after finding nothing linking him to terrorism. In 2012, Tamerlan spent six months in the southwest Russian regions of Chechnya and Dagestan, where authorities have said they suspect he tried to join insurgents, but was unsuccessful. After returning to the U.S., Tamerlan was twice asked to leave a mosque over outbursts. The first time, he stood up at the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center and argued with a preacher who said it was appropriate for Muslims to celebrate U.S. holidays. Two months later, he called a preacher who praised civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. a 'non-believer' who was 'contaminating people's minds.' Mosque leaders said they told him he would not be welcome if he interrupted again and he did not cause any more problems. In their court filings, Dzhokhar's lawyers have asked prosecutors for any evidence 'showing that Tamerlan's pursuit of jihad predated Dzhokhar's' because that 'would tend to support the theory that Tamerlan was the main instigator of the tragic events that followed.' But prosecutors are prepared to argue that Dzhokhar was a full and willing participant in the bombings. They cite a message scrawled inside the boat he was found hiding in, indicating that the bombings were meant to retaliate against the U.S. for the deaths of civilians during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished,' he wrote, according to excerpts filed in court. 'Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.'","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is accused of 30 crimes for allegedly working with his brother, Tamerlan, to plan and carry out the 2013 attack .

"As a lifelong fan, the practicalities of going half way round the world for a ‘panda short break’ were never questioned. True, we’ve got two of the species our own now, far closer to home at Edinburgh Zoo but nothing beats seeing them in - or at least in the same country as - their natural environment. So, I readily travelled to the Sichuan province in southwest China, the native home of the giant panda to visit two breeding centres. Scroll down for video . Volunteer keepers are instructed to chop bamboo and weigh out portions of panda cake . Fluffy panda pups sleep on a table at a breeding centre in the Chengdu province that tourists can visit . Today, there are thought to be only 1,600 left in the wild and they exist in a few, fairly inaccessible, mountainous areas. They are reclusive animals and  difficult to spot. But these two dedicated breeding centres give you an opportunity to watch these incredible creatures close-up – in surroundings that are as much like their natural habitat as possible. The Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Base – just outside the city of Chengdu – is home to 83 adults and cubs. If you get here shortly after 8am you avoid the crowds and have ample time to watch the pandas before they get lethargic later on in the day. They live in spacious enclosures with trees, mounds, wooden climbing frames with slides and – if there are cubs – a few plastic rocking horses. Pandas are captivating animals, particularly the cubs who spend much of the time embroiled in seemingly vicious playfights. These can last up to half an hour – or until they are exhausted – and involve biting, wresting, yapping and rolling interlocked down slides and ditches. Sophie pets a young panda cub at the Chengdu sanctuary during her visit . Panda cubs spend much of their time embroiled in seemingly vicious playfights that can last half an hour . At the panda nursery, you can look through glass to see tiny babies – one or two months old - sleeping in cots or on blankets on the floor. Normally they are born in either late June, July or September and weigh just 100g – an average adult is 900 times the size. They don’t grow fur until one week and open their eyes at about six weeks. Bifengxia Panda Centre allows volunteers to be panda keepers for the day at a cost of about £35 . But giant panda cubs aren’t easy to produce. The females are only fertile for between one and three days a year in spring and even then the couple often don’t appear to know how to mate or get bored half way through. For this reason, the breeding centres commonly resort to panda IVF. This is similar to the human version and pandas are sedated while a sample of sperm is taken from the male and implanted into the female. Edinburgh Zoo has twice used IVF on Tian Tian and Yuang Guang - without success. They have been on loan from the Chinese government since 2011 and will remain for another seven years in a bid to help them produce a cub. Hopes were initially raised this summer when Tian Tian appeared to be pregnant but it later emerged she had reabsorbed the cub, a common occurrence. Just a two hours’ drive south west from Chengdu by bus or taxi is the Bifengxia Panda Centre – which is where the Edinburgh pandas are from. Here you volunteer to be a panda keeper for a day for roughly £35. I was handed overalls, gloves and ‘all access’ passes allowing us into the enclosures. I was instructed to chop bamboo and weigh out portions of panda cake – a nutritious mixture of soy, corn, bamboo and egg – before feeding it to them. Stroking is strictly forbidden in case the pandas bite but when the keepers aren’t watching, it’s very difficult to resist. Stroking the pandas is forbidden but with cuties like this it's hard to resist when the keepers aren't watching . The volunteer program is disorganised and even if you do it for a week, you will remain at the same enclosure undertaking the same tasks. A day is plenty – however much you love pandas. Bifengxia only started admitting tourists in 2008 and is far less developed than the breeding centre at Chengdu, which has been open since 1993. The advantage is that it isn’t nearly as crowded although, by comparison, there is very limited information about the individual pandas, the species  or how the breeding program works. At the end of the day it's possible to do a stunning, three-mile walk along Bifengxia gorge back to the car park with views of waterfalls and sheer cliff faces. There are also regular shuttle buses though if your legs aren't up to it. Both Bifengxia and Chengdu offer tourists the chance to hug a teenage panda for one minute – strictly timed – for a charge of about £200. Bifengxia only started admitting tourists in 2008 and is far less developed than the breeding centre . Not just for the black and white variety, red pandas also have a home at the breeding centres . Compared to the cost of volunteering for the day this seems extortionate and you can't help but worry about the effects it has on the panda. Pandas aside, Chengdu is striving to be China’s fifth most important city after Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Be a panda keeper for the day at Bifengxia Panda Centre for about £35. A standard double or ‘deluxe’ room at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, Chengdu, costs about £152 (1,488 Chinese Renminbi). A double or twin room at the Shangri-La hotel costs about £163 (1,608 RMB). British Airways flies five times a week direct from Heathrow to Chengdu on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Return fares start from £570 return, including taxes and charges. For reservations visit ba.com or call 0844 493 0758. The main Tianfu square, the People’s park, the numerous temples and street markets can easily take up a day. It is also famed for its tea houses - but beware the men brandishing metal rods offering to dewax your ears for a small fee. I also spent a night at Mount Emei, a holy mountain two hours south-west of Chengdu which is a great spot for hiking. The Buddhist temples and summit of the mountain get very crowded, particularly during summer and public holidays. But hiking isn’t popular in China so there are very few tourists on the scenic – and at times, strenuous, trails - in between. I drove back by the Leshan giant Buddha, the largest in the world at 71m. This is one of China’s most famous attractions and is probably best visited for a few hours towards the end of the day when the crowds have thinned. British Airways started flying direct from Heathrow to Chengdu last year and there are now five flights a week making a panda short break entirely feasible. And at least some of that 11 hour flight home can be passed flicking back through pictures or footage of those adorable creatures.","Sophie Borland visited China's Sichuan province to learn about the species .

"Oops: Shawn Robinson of Alexandria, Virginia is charged with impersonating an officer after he tried to pull over an off-duty cop on Thursday . A Virginia man was jailed Thursday after authorities say he impersonated a police offer when pulled over an off-duty cop. Shawn Michael Robinson, 27, was driving a Crown Victoria on Thursday morning when he pulled up to the actual cop and shined a spotlight attached to the car inside the cop's vehicle, police say. The real cop informed Robinson of his day job leading the Alexandria man, and his passenger, to then flee, authorities told WUSA. When the off-duty officer pursued the car, Robinson allegedly then fled on foot with the passenger. Robinson would later turn himself in to police after learning a warrant had been issued for his arrest. He's now being held without bond and is due to appear in court March 4. Robinson's wasn't the only such arrest made last week. Two days later, a Florida teen was collared for impersonating a Palm Beach County Sherrif's deputy in full uniform after an officer pulled him over for running a red light. He was also driving with a suspended learner's permit. The boy's grandmother said the boy took her car without her knowledge, but she called the situation a misunderstanding, according to WPBF.com. She said the teen 'wasn't trying to impersonate anybody' and was wearing a shirt given to him by his mentors, who she said are police with the sheriff's office. The boy was heading out to meet with them when the incident occurred, she said.

"Plastic surgery is a form of 'aggression' against the female body 'like a burqa made of the flesh,' according to the Vatican. The working paper for a church plenary assembly on 'Women's Cultures: Equality and Difference' looked at the pressure faced by women and issues of body image. But even as it acknowledged for centuries offering women 'ideological and ancestral left-overs', the church also faced ridicule for distributing a promo video featuring a 'sexy' blonde actress. Improving on God's work? The Vatican's council for culture has spoken out against cosmetic surgery . In the Pontifical Council for Culture's working paper, cardinals noted that going under the knife for elective surgery has been linked to eating disorders and depression. 'Plastic surgery that is not medico-therapeutic can be aggressive toward the feminine identity, showing a refusal of the body in as much as it is a refusal of the 'season' that is being lived out,' it said. The members of the Pontifical Council also warned over the 'indiscriminate and undifferentiated' objectification of women in the media and advertising. 'No political or social battle has been able to do without a mechanism so profoundly rooted as that of the exploitation of the female body for commercial benefit,' the working paper said. The inflammatory language chosen by the Catholic church seems set to annoy Muslims, however Muslim women's groups contacted by MailOnline were not answering calls on Sunday morning. The Catholic women's initiative also landed the Vatican at the centre of a storm of criticism over a video starring a 'sexy blonde'. The Internet promotional video, featuring blonde Italian actress Nancy Brilli, came under such ridicule that it was quickly taken down, it has been reported. In the clip, the 50-year-old, dressed in a blue top, asks her viewers how often they ask themselves 'Who are you? What do you do? What do you think about yourself as a woman?' The glamorous face of women's rights: A new Catholic women's initiative rolled out by the Vatican is at the centre of a storm of criticism over a video starring a 'sexy blonde' Equal but still fabulous: The Internet promotional video, featuring blonde Italian actress Nancy Brilli (pictured), came under such ridicule that it was quickly taken down, it has been reported . But the video soon sparked criticism from around the English speaking world. 'What were they thinking at the Vatican?' wrote Phyllis Zagano of Hofstra University in the National Catholic Reporter. 'Aside from the obvious - sexy sell has long gone by the boards in developed nations and is totally unacceptable in predominantly Muslim countries - the fact of the matter is that highlighting a stereotypical spokeswoman is not the way to ask for women's input.' The women's initiative came courtesy of Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi whose office launched the #lifeofwomen crowd-sourcing scheme just before Christmas. It was rolled out in a bid to promote an inaugural meeting this week aimed at studying women's issues. Women were invited from around the globe to send in a 60-second video of their lives for possible inclusion in a montage to be screened at the 'big meeting of cardinals and bishops'. The English version of Brilli's promo was taken down, though the Italian remains on the ministry's website, Associated Press reports. Expert on women... The women's initiative came courtesy of Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi whose office launched the #lifeofwomen crowd-sourcing scheme just before Christmas . Critics noted that the women the Vatican might most want to hear from - those suffering from poverty, violence or war - might not have a smart phone at hand to send in a clip. Others pointed out that the two-week deadline - at the height of the Christmas holidays - worked against any widespread response. The working paper for the Pontifical Council of Culture's plenary assembly on 'Women's Cultures: Equality and Difference' speaks about opening the church's doors to women so they can offer their skills 'in full collaboration and integration' with men. It denounces plastic surgery as a form of 'aggression' against the female body 'like a burqa made of flesh.' And it acknowledges that the church has for centuries offered women 'ideological and ancestral left-overs.' In the end, some 250 videos were sent in with a number of them coming from activists advocating for women's ordination. Consuela Corradi, a sociologist at Rome's Catholic Lumsa university, was one of 15 women who advised Ravasi on the initiative. She complained that criticism of the video was unfair. 'If we had chosen an ugly woman, would that have changed the message? I don't think so,' she said. She said the women consultants were entirely responsible for penning the working document, with no interference from the ministry, though she said their document was trimmed for length.","Cosmetic surgery is 'aggressive' towards female identity, says Vatican .

"The discovery of the dismembered body of a Thai bar dancer has sparked an international manhunt for a British man wanted for questioning in connection with her death. Thai police have named 45-year-old Shane Looker, from Stoke-on-Trent, as the last person known to have been in contact with murder victim Laxami 'Pook' Manochat. The dancer's body was sliced into pieces before it was stuffed inside a suitcase and thrown into the Mae Klong River in Kanchanaburi, 70 miles south of Thai capital Bangkok. Scroll down for video . Wanted for questioning: Shane Looker, left, originally from Stoke-on-Trent, is wanted by police in Thailand in connection with the murder of Laxami 'Pook' Manochat, right, who was found dismembered in a suitcase . National police in Bangkok said Looker and Miss Manochat were captured on CCTV leaving the Nana Plaza in the city, an area that nightly attracts hundreds of foreign men in search of drink and sex. Looker had entered Thailand on October 31 and was last seen with Miss Manochat on November 2, police said. The suitcase - weighed down with rocks - containing her body was found in the Mae Klong River on November 9. Investigators' first task was to identify the victim's remains. Once that was done they were able to identify Miss Manochat leaving Nana Plaza with a well-built white man. CCTV images of the pair were distributed across Thailand in an effort to identify the tourist, but his identity remained a mystery until a tip-off to Thai blog Stickboy. The blog was provided with Looker’s full name, nationality, and an address in Hua Hin, 90 miles south of Bangkok, along with a photo of his passport. The information was passed to police. Officers went to the address with a search warrant and although Looker had already left, they found the shorts and T-shirt he had allegedly been wearing on the night of November 1, when he was captured on CCTV. DNA taken from a number of items, including nail clippers and a toothbrush, matched DNA found under Miss Manochat’s finger nails. Last known picture: Looker pictured leaving Nana Plaza in Bangkok with Miss Manochat last November . Seedy: A sex worker adjusts her outfit while walking past a 'go-go' bar in Bangkok's Nana Plaza . The investigation also led officers to a shop where Looker allegedly bought rocks similar to those found weighing down the suitcase containing Miss Manochat's dismembered body. A new line of inquiry began - searching for the driver who took Looker out of Bangkok with Miss Manochat. It had been thought the pair had travelled straight from Bangkok to Kanchanaburi in the early hours of November 2. But police discovered he had checked out of Gulliver’s Hotel in Bangkok later that morning, taking a minibus bound for Hua Hin at 9.30am on November 2. What police have not disclosed is whether Miss Manochat was with him in the minibus. Further inquiries, said police, have ascertained that Looker fled Thailand into Malaysia, travelling by train over a border crossing, on November 24. The Thai blog said it is understood that from Malaysia Looker headed to Ibiza where he reportedly spends the European summer months and has a share in a hotel in Ibiza town. Thai police said they were seeking the assistance of Interpol to find the suspect.","Shane Looker was the last person seen with dancer Laxami Manochat .

Ann Mara slipped in front of her home in Rye, New York, during an ice storm two weeks ago and was hospitalized with a head injury the following day. John Mara says that while there were initial hopes for recovery, complications developed and she died early on Sunday. Ann Mara, the matriarch of the NFL's New York Giants for the past 60 years, has died. She was 85. She's seen here in February 2012 following the Giants' Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots . Ann Mara slipped in front of her home in Rye, New York, during an ice storm two weeks ago and was hospitalized with a head injury the following day. Mrs. Mara saw her Giants clench Super Bowl victories twice following the 2005 death of her NFL mogul husband . 'I am sad to say that our mother has passed away,' said John Mara in a statement Sunday. 'She has been the leader of our family in every way, and we will miss her dearly. She loved her family, and all of us were able to spend time with her in these final days . 'All 11 of her children and our spouses and numerous grandchildren were with her when she passed away.' Among the matriarch's 43 grandchildren are actresses Rooney Mara--best known for her role as Lisbeth Salander in the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo--and Kate Mara, who starred in Netflix series House of Cards. While they are the descendants of Giants founders on their father's side, Kate and Rooney's mother's family founded the Pittsburgh Steelers. It took until 2012 for their octogenarian matriarch to gain her own sort of pop cultural fame.

At left is NFL great Terry Bradshaw, whose video taped confrontation with the wise-cracking Mrs. Mara would win her a reputation as a fire cracker years later . In February of that year, Mara gained widespread notoriety for a confrontation she had with NFL great turned football commentator Terry Bradshaw. After her Giants defeated the 49's to clench the NFC title, Mara approached Bradshaw and cried loudly 'You never pick the Giants!' over her son--president and CEO of the Giants, John Mara--protested and cameras rolled. In a statement obtained by the New York Daily News, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said: . 'Mrs. Mara was a tower of strength, dignity and inspiration for her family and all of us in the NFL. 'Her family and the Giants organization have always reflected Mrs. Mara's competitive spirit, integrity and wonderful sense of humor.' Ann Mara and her children owned 50 percent of the Giants, one of the founding families of the league, since the death of her husband, Wellington, in 2005. While she was not active in daily operations, her opinion was valued greatly.

"For Grace Bates, he was the one she let get away. But now, the 74-year-old has finally been reunited with the handsome German man she split up with almost 60 years ago. Ms Bates met her true love, Hermann Bosche, in 1956 as a 17-year-old. The pair quickly fell in love and planned a future together. But the problem with their blossoming relationship was that she was already engaged to someone else. Scroll down for video . Grace Bates, 74, and Hermann Bosche, 78, have been reunited after spending almost 60 years apart . Ms Bates met her true love, Hermann Bosche, in 1956 as a teenager but she was already engaged at the time . After she broke his heart, the blond 20-year-old left in 1958 for America and Ms Bates felt guilty about the break-up for decades. Her attempts to find him failed, but thanks to a BBC television show, she managed to track him down and finally say sorry. Now, after almost 60 years apart, the pair are beginning to rebuild their relationship. 'It’s like a dream come true to have found him. I feel my heart is back in the right place,' she told The Sunday Mirror. 'I don’t want to go to my grave thinking I have never said sorry to him.' Recalling the moment she first saw him as she worked at a market near her home in Chellaston, Derbyshire, she said he was 'beautiful and handsome'. She added she didn't speak a word of German, but he taught her one phrase: ‘ich liebe dich’ which means 'I love you'. Mr Bosche, from Pennsylvania, had been happily married in America for 50 years before his wife died in 2013 . She said she had wanted to break off the engagement because she 'knew Hermann was the one'. But instead of ending things with her fiancé, she ended up pregnant after sleeping with him. She hid the truth from Mr Bosche until she started to show - and when found out, he was devastated. Heartbroken, he left the country in May 1958. She gave birth to a girl but her baby's father left her. To avoid the scandal, she was quickly married off again. It ended in divorce and Ms Bates never remarried. She had given up hope of ever finding her true love again, but last year, researchers for a new BBC One programme traced Mr Bosche to Kunkletown, Pennsylvania. Now 78, he had been happily married for 50 years before his wife died in 2013. They reunited in Lodnon and have since become good friends after speaking regularly. She has visited him twice in Pennsylvania. 'When I heard Grace wanted to get in touch I was a little numb at first because I haven’t thought of her in such a long time,' he said. 'We all did something we shouldn’t have. I have no regrets.' She's felt guilty for decades, adding: 'I don’t want to go to my grave thinking I have never said sorry to him'","Grace Bates met Hermann Bosche in 1956 when she was 17 years old .

"A good Samaritan did a good deed for a homeless man by giving him a Kindle to pursue his love of reading. The San Diego man, who wishes to remain anonymous, would take frequent business trips to Las Vegas when he'd often see a homeless man reading one book repeatedly. During his last visit, he decided to strike up a conversation with the man, called Paul, about his book and soon found out that he loved to read, but only had one book. Reading: Paul told the man that he loved to read books, but unfortunately he only had one book to read . The man told The Huffington Post: 'I just asked him if he liked to read. He said he loved to but that he had been reading that one book over and over for a while now.' In a kind gesture, the man remembered that he was carrying his Kindle in his bag, and decided to give it to Paul and teach him how to use it. It was soon clear how much  Paul enjoyed using the device - which is an e-reader by Amazon. He decided to take a picture of Paul and his new Kindle, and shared it on Reddit on Thursday under the username, mjuad. The photograph quickly went viral, receiving  nearly two million views on Imgur - which describes itself as the Internet's visual storytelling community where people post pictures. He said: 'It brought me a lot of joy to see someone getting so much from something that I gave them. It feels so good to see someone get so much for something I took for granted.' Luckily, Paul does not need to download books. The Kindle is already stocked with around 300 books. In another grand gesture, the man gave Paul an address where he could send the device, cash on delivery, should he need more reading material. He told the website: 'If I can keep someone from going hungry for a day or brighten their day/life up in any way, I always try to do my best. 'I'm also hoping that by sharing this, I will encourage others to do something kind as well.'","The San Diego man was on a business trip in Las Vegas when he saw Paul .

"This is the moment a foul-mouthed police officer pulled his gun on a group of teenagers - reportedly because they were having a snowball fight. The officer, filmed walking from a patrol car, shouts 'don't f*****g move, guys!' at the group of six people standing at a snowy intersection. He demands they get down on their knees, and frisks one while pointing his gun towards the others, in footage thought to have been recorded in New Rochelle, New York, this week.

The woman recording the footage then says: 'They were having a snowball fight - This group of guys was having a snowball fight and now a cop has a gun on them.' New Rochelle's police department has so far refused to comment on the video.

"A couple have vowed to fight for justice after their three-month-old daughter died just hours after being sent home from A&E. Alisha Pullen and Luke Gloster took baby Esme to Royal Stoke University Hospital in December where doctors diagnosed the infant with bronchiolitis and sent the family home. Six hours later Miss Pullen, 20, discovered her daughter had stopped breathing in her cot. They were rushed back to the hospital by ambulance where the baby was pronounced dead on arrival. Esme Gloster died six hours after being sent home from A&E. The three-month-old's parents, Alisha Pullen and Luke Gloster, are now demanding answers as to why they were sent away by doctors . A coroner's investigation has been launched into Esme's death with her distraught parents demanding answers as to why they were sent away by health workers. Describing the heartbreaking moment she realised her child had died, Miss Pullen said: ''When we got there, I knew from the man’s face. I just needed to hear it for it to be real. 'I fell to the floor. I just couldn't believe what was going on. 'I could not believe that I was going to hold my baby in my arms, dead. 'It was just horrible.' Miss Pullen, a first-time mother, first visited a walk-in health centre after noticing her daughter having difficulty breathing on December 13. After showing no signs of improvement the infant was taken to Royal Stoke University Hospital where doctors said she would likely recover at home. 'We took our little girl to professionals on two occasions,' she added. 'I feel they could have done so much more to prevent whatever has happened to her.' Timothy Jones, Esme's grandfather, said he believed more could have been done to save his granddaughter's life. The baby's mother took her to a health centre after noticing her having difficulty breathing in December . Six hours after being sent home from A&E at Royal Stoke University Hospital the baby was rushed back by ambulance and pronounced dead on arrival . 'I believe that if they had kept her in, or transferred her to another hospital, then she would still be with us,' the 42-year-old said. 'I’m finding it hard to believe that nothing could have been done. 'Since this happened we have heard that children who die from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome show signs of illness beforehand. 'Esme was showing signs of illness, so why wasn’t she kept in hospital and observed? 'I just can’t fathom it.' Experts have suggested Esme's death was the result of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome after a post-mortem examination returned an inconclusive result. Dr Martin Samuels, Consultant Paediatrician, and an expert on the syndrome, at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, said: 'Minor symptoms are very common in babies. 'If you look at cot death victims who are classified subsequently as having died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome it’s common that there are going to be minor symptoms before a death arises. 'In my experience it is important that we offer support for families who have lost a child to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and our team has continued to remain in contact with the family. 'There are support groups, such as The Lullaby Trust, which is a charitable organisation, which also support families whose babies have died suddenly and unexpectedly.' Esme's parents are now demanding justice for their daughter's death which, they claim, could have been prevented .","Esme Gloster died six hours after being sent home with a 'chest infection'

"Parents of soldiers killed in Afghanistan are 'furious' that they have been excluded from a memorial service - while politicians and VIPs are expected to pack the event. The service, set to be held at St Paul's Cathedral two days before Mothering Sunday, will remember the 453 servicemen killed and thousands injured during the 13-year conflict. But just 906 tickets have been dished out and only the spouses of fallen soldiers have been invited along with a 'plus one' leaving hundreds of grieving parents disappointed. Jacquie McDonald, 53, from Edinburgh, who lost her son Sean, 26, in 2010 after he stepped on an improvised explosive device (IED), said she feels as though parents have been 'cast aside'. Sean McDonald, 26, having his last cuddle with  mother Jacquie, 53, who feels parents have been 'cast aside' after not being invited to memorial service . The service, set to be held at St Paul's Cathedral, will remember the 453 servicemen killed, including Corporal Ivano Violino pictured with his mother Diane Bell . Sean had been married for 18 months, but Mrs McDonald has never had a close relationship with his wife. 'It's so insensitive. My son made the ultimate sacrifice and I should be able to honour his memory,' said Mrs McDonald. 'People can have several partners, but they will only ever have one mother. 'We are the ones who walked the floor with them for hours when they cried and wiped their knees when they fell. 'It's as if the parents have been cast aside.' Sean had selflessly gone back to help a comrade when the device exploded, killing him instantly. Sergeant Simon Valentine's mother Carol, 56, (pictured together) said she is 'astonished' by the decision as the service falls just before Mother's Day . Sgt Valentine (right), of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, married just a few years before he stepped on an IED while on patrol in 2009, pictured with his mother Carol . 'As a parent nothing can prepare you for your child dying before you - and nothing can prepare you for being denied an invitation when there is an opportunity to remember them,' said his mother. 'His wife may receive an invitation, but as we haven't seen each other in years, it's highly unlikely she'll ask me to be her plus one.' Mrs McDonald has been in contact with other bereaved parents who have found themselves in the same situation since the service was announced by David Cameron on Wednesday. They are now calling on the Ministry of Justice to remember mothers and fathers. Janette Binnie, from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, whose son Sean was killed in Helmand Province in 2009, said she feels as though parents are being 'alienated'. 'It's not right – I think it should be the wife or husband and parents who attend,' she said. 'It's humiliating and degrading not being given the chance to pay tribute to your own son. 'I don't mean to sound selfish, but Sean was my only child. I carried him for nine months, brought him up and nurtured him. This is alienating parents.' Janette Binnie, whose son Sean (pictured together) was killed in Helmand Province in 2009, said she feels as though parents are being 'alienated' Acting Sergeant Sean Binnie's (left) legal next of kin is wife Amanda, who married the soldier just six months before he was killed in action with 3 Scots, the Black Watch . Acting Sergeant Sean Binnie's legal next of kin is wife Amanda, who married the soldier just six months before he was killed in action with 3 Scots, the Black Watch. As Sean, 22, was married, it is Amanda who will be invited to the 2,000-capacity commemoration. But his parents Janette, 47, and Allan, 45, who no longer have a close relationship with their son's widow, won't be issued with tickets. Sean was killed during a firefight with insurgents near Musa Qala, where he was serving as part of the Battle Group mentoring the Afghan National Army. He was buried near his family's home in Northern Ireland, making it difficult for his Scottish family to visit the grave. Last week, Mrs Binnie penned a letter to the Prime Minister, calling for parents to be added to the memorial service guest list. She is being supported by Caroline Whitaker, whose son, Sergeant Gareth Thursby, was shot by a rogue Afghan policeman just two years ago. Sgt Valentine's (pictured) mother said there was a similar situation when the list of names of soldiers was unveiled at the Arboretum in Staffordshire . Gareth, from Skipton, North Yorkshire, had been married for seven years, but Mrs Whitaker's relationship with her son's wife is not as strong as it used to be. 'It's not an issue with the partners. It's the MOD's lack of compassion for parents who have lost their children,' said Mrs Whitaker. 'What annoys me more than anything else is that there will be 453 next of kin and one other, the rest will be dignitaries who never met our children. 'Ex-partners can move on, but parents can't. I have had a hole in my heart ever since he died.' Gareth, who was 29 when he died, joined the Army aged just 16. He served with the Yorkshire Regiment, who have been very inclusive of Caroline so far. 'It's bizarre that a local regiment could be so supportive, but as soon as there's a national event, I'm left out. I effectively gave my son to the forces,' said his mother. 'I don't want anybody to forget my son - or where he came from. That's why it's so important for parents, especially mums, to be able to attend these types of events.' Diane Bell, 61 from Manchester, whose son Corporal Ivano Violino, 29 was killed in a convoy, which hit an IED in September 2007, feels the same way, . 'It is disgusting, the way we have been treated. He had only been married for 12 weeks. The Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, senior politicians, military chiefs and veterans of the campaign have all been handed tickets, pictured is Corporal Ivano Violino with his children . 'He had twins from a previous relationship and she can't attend either. I have no relationship with his current partner, so there is no way I could get a ticket from her. 'I feel it is rubbing salt in the wounds and I am willing to stand outside the service and make my feelings known. We wouldn't have the best army in the world without us mothers, David Cameron is a disgrace.' Sergeant Simon Valentine's mother Carol, 56, said she is 'astonished' by the decision as the service falls just before Mother's Day. 'It was the same situation when the list of names of soldiers was unveiled at the Arboretum in Staffordshire,' she said. 'I wasn't issued with an invite, I had to fight for one. 'But it shouldn't be this way. The fact that the memorial service next month falls just days before Mother's Day and mothers are being denied access astonishes me.' Simon, of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, married just a few years before he stepped on an IED while on patrol in 2009. The Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, senior politicians, military chiefs and veterans of the campaign have all been handed tickets. Representatives of the Afghan nation will also be present, together with leaders of world faiths. Mothers who have not been granted entry into the service are expected to demonstrate outside St Paul's Cathedral during the ceremony. A spoksperson for the Ministry of Defence said: 'This service is intended to honour the contribution of all those who served in Afghanistan from 2001, whether the 100,000 military personnel or the civilians that worked there. 'Unavoidably, limited capacity at St Paul's means we are unable to include everyone who would wish to attend but by reserving half of the congregation places we are ensuring that two people with close ties to anyone who lost their life in Afghanistan can attend. 'The rest of the congregation will be made up of Armed Forces personnel and civilians who served in Afghanistan, veterans, international partners and supporting organisations.'","Parents of fallen soldiers 'furious' they have been excluded from service .

"A father is footing $18,000 in fines because his son constantly drove across a toll bridge thinking he could just pay later.

"Wedding receptions are notorious for drinking, dancing and questionable decision-making. But while a few red faces the following morning have come to be expected, little thought is often given to just what the rental companies - tasked with cleaning up after the fact - discover in the process. Now, new data released by Young's Hire, one of the UK's leading formal menswear retailers, is sharing some of the most shocking and unusual items discovered in returned grooms and ushers' suits over the past 12 months. Wedding receptions are known for groomsmen getting wild, but what do the suit cleaners find the next day? Young's Hire has revealed a list of the strangest items found in suit pockets, such as rotting prawns . Standard post-wedding checks on garments have turned up everything from a pocketful of rotting prawns to over a dozen pairs of false teeth, and, less surprisingly, copious amounts of non-prescription drugs . And while a full-size clown's costume may strike you as the most confounding - how would it fit in a suit pocket? - there are a few items that make much more regular appearances. Garters, Viagra and marriage certificates are often fished out of suit pockets the following morning, while prophylactics and wallets are also commonly found. So much so, in fact, that Young's has dedicated an area of their warehouse exclusively for the garters that have been discarded.

"Suge Knight's attorney boasted last week that the rap mogul was innocent of homicide and that surveillance footage would prove it. But it has now been revealed that the CCTV camera trained at the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant where Knight allegedly ran over two men, killing one, last Thursday was not working the night in question. The owner of Tam's Burger in Compton, California confirmed the security camera was broken in an interview with TMZ. It actually appears that no security cameras in the area captured the bloody scene, though the parking lot is bordered by a Wells Fargo, Louisiana Fried Chicken and Rite Aid. Law enforcement sources also told TMZ that they are hoping someone filmed the fight on their cell phone footage, though they previously said in statements that they already had video evidence of the killing. Scroll down for videos . This image from video shows Death Row Records founder Marion 'Suge' Knight, right, walking into the Los Angeles County Sheriffs department early Friday morning after turning himself in . Out of order: The owner of Tam's Burgers in Compton, California says CCTV wasn't working the night Knight allegedly killed a man. Above, an LAPD photographer checks the scene of the incident . Sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida previously said that detectives were reviewing a video, but 'they have made no such arrangements with' Knight's attorney nor did they plan to show it to him. Meanwhile, Knight remained jailed on suspicion of murder after turning himself in early Friday. He's being held on $2 million bail. Sheriff's deputies said Knight hit and killed his friend Terry Carter, 55, with his pickup truck Thursday in the parking lot of a Compton fast-food restaurant, also injuring Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, an actor and film consultant who was hospitalized and in stable condition late Friday. Blatt said Knight was an innocent victim who accidentally ran over the men as he tried to escape a vicious attack. The incident was the latest in a long line of brushes with death and the law for the 49-year-old founder of Death Row Records, one of the genre's leading labels. Knight started the label that helped solidify West Coast rap with Dr. Dre, who had been a member of the legendary group N.W.A. The label also launched the career of Snoop Dogg and had Tupac Shakur in the last months of his life. Knight is the founder of Death Row Records, which worked with Tupac Shakur (Knight and the rapper pictured above in August 19996 file photo) in the last months of his life . The fatal run-in occurred a short while after Knight was told by deputies providing security to leave a film location after arguing with Sloan, who was working on the set, during a break from filming a promotional video for the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" about the rise of N.W.A. The argument resumed and escalated a short while later at a fast-food restaurant a few miles away, with Knight and Sloan exchanging punches through his open window, sheriff's Lt. John Corina said. Corina said Knight backed up his pickup truck and knocked Sloan down. 'Then he puts the truck in drive, drives forward, running over him, and then keeps going forward and keeps on driving, and runs over Carter, who is standing in the parking lot, and keeps on going after that,' Corina said. He said witnesses told investigators it looked like an intentional act. Authorities said they do not believe Carter was involved in the altercation. Blatt said Knight was called to Tam's Burgers in Compton by Carter for a meeting and was attacked by four people, including Sloan, as he slowed his truck. The men beat him through his window, tried to pull him outside, and threatened to kill him. Knight punched the gas and fled in fear, Blatt said. He had no idea he hit two men. Corina said that claim is hard to believe, and there's no evidence thus far of four attackers. The incident came less than six months after Knight was shot six times at a West Hollywood nightclub in August — the second shooting he's survived. No arrests have been made. At 6-foot-4 and weighing 325 pounds, Knight has a reputation as an imposing figure that is credited, in part, with helping create Death Row Records when he strong-armed another label to release Dr. Dre from his contract, said Chuck Creekmur, CEO of allhiphop.com. Knight was at the center of one of the most notorious rap conflicts of the 1990s, pitting Tupac Shakur against Biggie Smalls in an East Coast-versus-West Coast rivalry. Knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with Shakur at a Las Vegas hotel, just hours before Shakur was fatally shot while riding in Knight's car just east of the Strip. Smalls, whose real name was Chris Wallace, was shot to death in a similar attack six months later. Knight and Dre later had a falling out, and Dre left. The record company eventually declared bankruptcy and was auctioned off. Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, another former N.W.A. member, were at the film location Thursday, but they didn't see Knight. In November, Knight pleaded not guilty to a robbery charge filed after a celebrity photographer accused him of stealing her camera in Beverly Hills. Because of prior convictions, he could face up to 30 years in prison.","Suge Knight allegedly 'ran over and killed' Terry Carter, 55, on Thursday afternoon in the parking lot of a burger restaurant .

The rear-engined supercar features upwardly swinging scissor doors, 20in alloy wheels and raised twin exhausts. It's tipped to compete at Le Mans next year, which is apt as it's the 50th anniversary of Ford's original GT beating Ferrari's six year winning streak at the race. At its heart is a 600bhp 3.5-litre twin-turbo V6 EcoBoost engine linked to a sporty seven-speed dual clutch transmission. A teardrop-shaped cabin reduces wind resistance and the driver and passenger are cocooned in a super-strong carbon-fibre cell. The rear spoiler can deploy automatically to help keep the car rooted to the ground. Fierce stopping power is provided by carbon-ceramic brakes. Mr Callum told Auto Express magazine: 'We wanted people to recognise it as a Ford GT, but didn't want to do the heritage car we've done in the past. 'I'm still pinching myself that we got to do it. That we knew it was going to be a production car helped. I think the danger was going off in flights of fancy. But it really kept us grounded.' Raj Nair, Ford's vice-president for global product development, said: 'The GT is the ultimate execution of an enthusiast supercar. It includes innovations and technologies that can be applied across our future portfolio.' Away from the Motown hype, Britain's biggest-selling marque for the 38th consecutive year celebrated a double win. The Ford Mondeo was crowned estate car of the year in the What Car? awards after only its first full month on sale. And the Fiesta ST was best hot hatch for the second year running. What Car? singled out the Mondeo 1.6 TDCi Zetec estate, capable of more than 74mpg. It's priced at £23,045, comes with SYNC2 connectivity and 8in touchscreen as standard, plus cruise control, DAB radio and a rear seat ski hatch. Editor Jim Holder said: 'It's hard to find an estate car that excels in every single area, yet Ford has got it spot on with the new Mondeo. Just like the old car, it's fantastic to drive, with a refined engine and a smooth ride. 'It's cracking value and will be cheaper to run than most of its rivals, thanks to CO2 emissions of just 99g/km.' The Fiesta ST, from £17,395, was praised for its 'dynamic yet practical' style, high performance and value. An all-new Galaxy seven-seater will go on sale in the summer along with a new S-MAX, C MAX, Grand C-MAX and Mustang. The new Edge SUV will also go into production this year. If owning one of the last Land Rover Defenders to be produced still isn't exclusive enough for you, a Leeds-based company is offering what it calls the 'ultimate Defender.' The model dates back to 1948. These, the final batch, are special editions ranging from £27,800 to £61,845. But modification specialist KhanDesign has pumped and pimped up the basic version to produce a 4x4 with near-supercar performance — and a £150,000 price-tag to match. Its Flying Huntsman 105 Longnose is an elongated Defender with a 450 bhp 6.2-litre V8 petrol engine. It will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show this spring. Cheeky little Fiat is putting a large amount of oomph into its new 500X crossover that had its UK debut party in East London this week. A risqué promo film, shot in Italy, has already become an internet sensation. It features a man of advancing years who, with amorous intent in mind, loses his little blue pill out of the window. It bounces around the ancient hilltop town — narrowly missing an open-mouthed priest — until it lands in the tank of a young chap's standard Fiat 500, which instantly morphs into the bigger, testosterone-charged 500X as he fills it with petrol. Nancy Dell'Olio attends the Fiat 500X event this week, where Dynamo performaned, at the Copper Box Arena, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London . The film was quite the talk of the event at the Copper Box Arena, at the Queen Elizabeth Park in Stratford, this week, which also featured magician Dynamo and guests including Nancy Dell'Olio (pictured with the car). Fiat is holding a nationwide promotional tour and more than 71,000 potential customers have already registered an interest. It is available in April from £14,595.

"Geri Halliwell and other celebrities poured more than £68million into a controversial fund accused of tax avoidance . Celebrities including the Beckhams, Robbie Williams and Geri Halliwell are among investors who poured more than £68million into a controversial fund accused of tax avoidance. The 141 stars and other members of the super-rich could have jointly saved £26million in tax in just one year alone through the film investment scheme. But many now face huge backdated bills as HM Revenue & Customs fights a legal battle to prove the venture was designed to avoid tax. Former Take That singer Mr Williams was the biggest individual investor in the Inside Track Productions scheme in 2002-03, according to a leaked list of those involved obtained by The Sunday Times. His £2million stake meant he could have reduced his tax bill by the same amount by offsetting his other income against losses made through the investment. Investors were also entitled to a percentage of any films’ profits. David and Victoria Beckham could have jointly secured a tax break of £1million by sinking money into Inside Track, whose biggest success was the Oscar-nominated Vera Drake in 2004. TV presenters Ant and Dec also invested and could have saved £100,000 each, while Anne Robinson and Jeremy Paxman were entitled to £50,000. Former Spice Girls Geri Halliwell and Melanie Chisholm took part, too, allowing them to reduce their tax liabilities by £800,000 and £100,000 respectively. Yesterday, a spokesman for Miss Chisholm said the singer had contacted HMRC ‘in light of recent concerns’ and settled ‘all outstanding claims’. It is not known if any of the investors claimed the tax breaks – and there is no suggestion they realised the fund could be viewed as a tax-avoidance scheme. Inside Track Productions was set up by Ingenious Media in 2002 after the then Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a policy designed to encourage investment in the British film industry. Investment company Ingenious, is now at the centre of a legal battle with the HMRC. Investors include the Beckhams, left, and Robbie Williams . But HMRC claims that the scheme was created as a way of generating tax relief for investors. A tax tribunal is hearing the case and is due to make its judgment later this year. Ingenious, whose credits include Avatar, Life Of Pi and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, insists its film investments were legitimate commercial ventures. In a statement it said the Government had changed its position in a ‘rather crude attempt to generate cash for the exchequer in a wholly unfair and unjust manner’. ‘The tribunal is ongoing. Ingenious remains confident of the outcome,’ it added. Former England captain Steven Gerrard was entitled to a tax break of £386,585 after investing with the firm . Accounts show Davina McCall invested with the firm, meaning she was entitled to a tax break of £150,000 . The case comes as HMRC launches a crackdown on tax-avoidance schemes. It is aiming to claw back £7.1billion from 43,000 people, it announced at the weekend. A spokesman for the Beckhams said yesterday: ‘As we have said on many occasions, the Beckhams have always paid their taxes in full and have never been involved in aggressive tax-avoidance schemes.’ None of the other stars was available for comment. Investnent firm Ingenious say its films, including Life of Pi, have generated £1billion in taxable revenue .","Ingenious investment firm is in a legal battle with HM Revenue & Customs .

"When Lisa Whaymand's life was saved by a bone marrow transplant, there was only one way she could thank her anonymous donor. Not allowed to know anything about him other than his sex and age, she was limited to forwarding a simple card. Until last year, that is. Remembering the selfless person who gave her the chance to see her children grow up, the 46-year-old mother of three answered an advert by cancer charity Anthony Nolan seeking to put survivors in touch with donors. Kindness of strangers: Mother-of-three Lisa Whaymand with bone marrow donor Neil Munro . 'There was no way I could have gone through life without finding him,' she said. 'It was always in the back of my mind. He saved my life.' The single mother was diagnosed in 2010, after suffering sore knees and chronic fatigue for several months. Blood tests revealed she had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia – which attacks white blood cells – and she was admitted to hospital. Just days from death, Miss Whaymand began chemotherapy straight away. Then in November that year, her consultant suggested she have a bone marrow transplant. The procedure had a 60 per cent chance of success – compared to just 40 per cent if she continued with chemotherapy. She went ahead with the operation and quickly began to improve. After just a few months, Miss Whaymand was allowed back home to be with her children Jack, 12, Harry, 11, and Olivia, eight. But she never forgot that she owed her life to the generosity of a stranger. The single mother was diagnosed in 2010, after suffering sore knees and chronic fatigue for several months . The Whaymands now keep in regular contact with Mr Munro, his wife Louise and their children Tara, 14, Connor, 13, and Kirsten, 11 . And last summer, four years after the transplant, she and her family found themselves on donor Neil Munro's doorstep. They had travelled from their home in Reading to find the 46-year-old in Aberdeen – with their meeting filmed for BBC series The Gift, which starts on Tuesday, February 10. 'It was a bit surreal,' Miss Whaymand said. 'I just grabbed him and gave him a massive bear hug. 'I said, 'You're amazing for what you've done, not just for me but for my family, my kids'.' She added that her son Jack waited until the cameras stopped rolling before shaking Mr Munro's hand. 'He said thank you for saving my mum. I was incredibly proud.' Last night Mr Munro said the meeting was 'very poignant'. He added: 'The actual marrow harvesting didn't look very nice, but I thought it was a small price to pay if it gave someone the chance to recover from leukaemia.' The Whaymands now keep in regular contact with Mr Munro, his wife Louise and their children Tara, 14, Connor, 13, and Kirsten, 11. 'It's so lovely that something good has come out of this trauma,' Miss Whaymand said. 'We're in touch all the time. We couldn't be happier.'","Mother-of-three Lisa Whaymand, 46, was saved by bone marrow transplant .

"Ronald Reagan bedded more than 50 of Hollywood's leading ladies at a luxury LA hotel bungalow, according to a sensational new biography. During his time as a young 'B-movie' Hollywood actor, Reagan courted screen sirens including Marilyn Monroe, Doris Day, Joan Blondell and Lana Turner at the three-bedroom bungalow in the grounds of the Garden of Allah hotel in Hollywood, the book claims. The revelations are made in a biography to be published on Valentine's Day titled Love Triangle: Ronald Reagan, Jane Wyman & Nancy Davis, reports The Sunday Times. Scroll down for video . Ronald Reagan (left) charmed more than 50 of Hollywood's leading ladies at his luxury LA villa, according to a new biography. During his time as an actor he became involved with the young Marilyn Monroe (right) The liaisons took place in a bungalow in the ground of the Garden of Allah hotel in Los Angeles (pictured) According to the book's author Darwin Porter, Reagan was involved with around 50 women in Hollywood. 'Nearly all of them spoke fondly of Reagan - even if they did not share his right-wing politics, they felt he was a nice guy,' said Porter, a journalist. 'But he suffered from what he jokingly referred to as 'leading- ladyitis.' The claims are made in a biography to be published on Valentine's Day titled Love Triangle: Ronald Reagan, Jane Wyman & Nancy Davis. Left: Joan Blondell and right, Lana Turner - the book claims Reagan slept with both of the actresses . The book claims that Reagan was considering marrying Doris Day,  (pictured) who would go on to become one of the biggest musical stars of the 1950, but he went on to marry another actress, Nancy Davis . He was accompanied by his neighbor Errol Flynn, who once boasted that he had spent 12,000 to 14,000 nights having sex. The liaisons were facilitated by Warner Bros which set him up dates with actresses to  push their talent further into the spotlight. In 1940 Reagan married actress Jane Wyman, but the book claims he was not faithful to her and he embarked on an affair with the star of The Oomph Girl, Ann Sheridan. It also claims that Jane was also being unfaithful and was sleeping with actor Lew Ayres (Ginger Rogers’ ex) while filming the Oscar-winning Johnny Belinda. They had two children - although one of them died -  and the book claims that when their marriage fell apart in 1948, he became involved with a young Marilyn Monroe. According to Phil Karlson, a director who introduced them, Reagan described her as 'sensational', to which she replied: 'I'm even more sensational when you get to know me,' reports The Sunday Times. The book claims that after his marriage to first wife, Jane Wyman, (both pictured) fell apart he became involved with a young Marilyn Monroe . The book, which goes further than any previous biographies, claims that Reagan was considering marrying Doris Day, but instead married another actress, the future first lady, Nancy Davis. She dated Clark Gable and Robert Stack before marrying Reagan in 1952. The book also focuses on Nancy who it states 'began her career posing for cheesecake in a failed attempt by the studio to turn her into a sex symbol.' Under the influence of Nancy's family, he switched from being a Democrat to being a Republican and staunch anti-communist before becoming the 40th President of the United States, serving from 1981-1989. He died in 2004 at age 93 after a long decline into Alzheimer's and was buried at his presidential library in Simi Valley, California. Reagan, pictured with Nancy, became the 40th President of the United States, serving from 1981-1989 . The book is in stark contrast to the Disney film being made about his life. Called Reagan, the film will be told from the point of view of a KGB officer who was tasked with keeping tabs on Reagan from his actor days in movies such as Bedtime for Bonzo. David Henrie, who is best known for playing Selena Gomez's older brother on the Disney channel show Wizards Of Waverly Place, will play a young Reagan in the $25 million indie film. Henrie will play Reagan in his teens and 20s, beginning with his time as a lifeguard, college football star and through his time as a radio announcer before he moved to Hollywood. The film is adapted by Space Cowboy's Howard Klausner and based on two biographies by Paul Kengor. Henrie is the first cast member to be announced. This will be the first biopic made for the silver screen about Reagan, who is still a beloved icon for millions, especially Republicans and conservatives.","Alleged liaisons took place at the Garden of Allah hotel in Los Angeles .

"Alex Salmond will force left-wing policies on Tory England if the SNP hold the balance of power after the next election, he boasted today. The former First Minister, who is standing for Parliament in May, said he would work with other parties except the Tories to 'see more progressive politics introduced across these islands'. Mr Salmond also refused to rule out becoming Deputy Prime Minister in a Labour-SNP Coalition – but said it was more likely that his party would prop up Ed Miliband in return for more powers for Scotland, a hike in the minimum wage and scrapping Britain's nuclear deterrent. Scroll down for video . Former First Minister Alex Salmond said he would work with other parties except the Tories to 'see more progressive politics introduced across these islands' The remarks came after Labour's election strategist Douglas Alexander failed to rule out a coalition with the SNP if Mr Miliband failed to win an outright majority. The shadow foreign secretary was repeatedly pressed on whether Labour would do a deal with Nicola Sturgeon's party but said he was 'not going to play that game'. But Mr Alexander insisted Labour would not be held to ransom over the renewal of Trident – the nuclear weapons system which needs replacing. He said: 'As a prospective foreign secretary in an incoming Labour government the responsibility of defending this country is not something that is the subject of simply trading away interests one way or another.' 'Our position on Trident is very clear and I'm not changing it,' he added. Mr Salmond told Sky News's Dermot Murnaghan programme the SNP would 'progress the Scottish interest' in any negotiations. The Tories put out an election poster last week claiming Ed Miliband could be propped up in Number 10 by the SNP and Sinn Fein . With Labour looking increasingly unlikely to win enough seats to form a majority after the election, both the Lib Dems and the SNP could hold the balance of power. Business Secretary Vince Cable today insisted he could happily work with Labour in the national interest. He said: 'I’ve worked with a team of Tory ministers, we don’t agree on a lot of things, but we work as a business-like team and I would a adopt the same approach to the Labour party. 'There are things in policy terms we do agree about and support for the industrial strategy is a good example, taxation of higher value properties is another. 'I think we have a more flexible approach to borrowing for good investment than the Tories do. 'We’ve always taken the view we are happy to work with other parties in the national interest.' He said that would mean, 'in particular' winning more powers for Holyrood. He said the SNP would have to 'enforce the delivery of the vow, the promise that was made to Scotland of home rule, neo-federalism, devo-to-the-max in these last desperate days of the referendum campaign'. But he added: 'There's also an area where the SNP, in conjunction with allies in Plaid Cymru in Wales and the Green Party in England will want to see more progressive politics introduced across these islands. 'For example, instead of another bout of austerity from Labour or Conservatives, the cancellation of the renewal of the Trident missile system, and diverting that funding, £30bn over the next ten years, into health and education and to something useful and productive. 'And I think that will have a lot of support in England as well as in Scotland.' Asked whether he would support Ed Miliband, perhaps by serving as deputy prime minister, Mr Salmond said a formal coalition was 'unlikely'. He said: 'Nicola Sturgeon's laid this out very clearly. What we've ruled out is any deal with the Conservative party, formal or informal. 'I think Nicola said that a formal coalition is unlikely. We're not ruling it out. But it would be unlikely. 'The best way to affect change is to negotiate on a vote-by-vote basis. And the things we're negotiating is delivery of the vow to Scotland, the cancellation of the renewal of the Trident system, and support for progressive politics, for progressive causes, things like the living wage across these islands.' Mr Salmond predicted another hung Parliament after the election – with no party holding enough seats to form a majority. He said: 'Nothing's certain in life or politics. But a balanced parliament looks pretty likely at the present moment. 'That looks like the most likely outcome. I'm hardly surprised because who'd want to give either David Cameron or Ed Miliband a majority? 'I don't think either of them is worth it. So a balanced parliament looks like the favourite at the present moment but nothing is certain.' Mr Alexander conceded the 'polls are tough' for Labour but insisted the party was fighting for a majority. He told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: 'The polls are tough, but the fact is after the referendum there were a very significant constituency in Scotland who want change. I share that appetite for change. 'In the coming election in May the way that we can secure that change is not to split the centre left vote but to deliver the maximum number of Labour MPs and, thereby, make sure we have a progressive government not a government led by David Cameron or a government of David Cameron and Nigel Farage.'","Former First Minister said SNP will work with other parties, but not Tories .

"Sir Michael Wilshaw claimed a thorough investigation found claims children were asked inappropriate questions were false . Ofsted guidance at the heart of a major row over ‘inappropriate’ questions fired at primary pupils can be revealed for the first time today. For years inspectors have been internally briefed that they can quiz pupils aged four to 11 about the word ‘gay’ and same-sex families, it has emerged. They have been told to ask young children if classmates are ever picked on for not behaving like a ‘typical girl’ or a ‘typical boy’. And since 2013 Ofsted briefings have also urged inspectors to tackle ‘transphobic’ bullying, by asking primary children if they think someone ‘born a girl who would rather be a boy, or born a boy who would like to be a girl’ would feel safe at their school. Ofsted has repeatedly denied that youngsters have been questioned about ‘inappropriate’ topics since the introduction of new rules last year requiring schools to promote ‘British’ values. Last week, Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, told the Commons’ education select committee that he had conducted a ‘thorough’ investigation into claims children were asked inappropriate questions and found them to be false. But as early as January 2012, the schools watchdog published a briefing for inspectors, telling them they could quiz primary pupils about aspects of homophobic bullying such as the use of the word ‘gay’ in school. In September 2013, the watchdog produced a new document, Exploring The School’s Actions to Prevent and Tackle Homophobic and Transphobic Bullying, which endorses asking primary pupils wide-ranging questions about homosexuality and transgender. It said: ‘Inspectors should make sure that questions are age-appropriate and asked in the right context. ‘With primary pupils inspectors might explore whether pupils ever hear anyone use the word “gay” when describing something, or whether they have been told by teachers that using the word “gay”, to mean something is rubbish, is wrong, scary or unpleasant and why it is wrong.’ Other topics to discuss included whether ‘pupils ever get picked on by other children for not behaving like a “typical girl” or a “typical boy’’’, and if they had lessons about ‘different types of families (single parent, living with grandparents, having step-parents, having two mums or two dads)’. This guidance, last issued in April 2014, also suggested inspectors could discuss with primary children if they thought ‘someone born a girl who would rather be a boy, or born a boy who would like to be a girl’ would ‘feel safe at school and be included’. Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland has been put in special measures after the official Ofsted report found that discrimination ‘persisted’ there . Durham Free School is to close after a damning report which claimed pupils held 'discriminatory' views . At secondary level, inspectors were told to explore with students whether a pupil or teacher ‘who thought of themselves as the opposite gender, feels safe and free from bullying at school’. This ‘briefing for section 5 inspection’ – along with other Ofsted documents – were replaced by a new, single School Inspection Handbook, officially published last September, which makes no reference to these types of questions. Two months later, Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland and Durham Free School were inspected by Ofsted. Grindon Hall, which has been put into special measures after children were labelled intolerant, has accused inspectors of questioning ten-year-olds about whether they knew what lesbians ‘did’, and if any of their friends felt trapped in the ‘wrong body’. And Durham Free School is set to close after Ofsted said some children displayed ‘discriminatory’ views towards people of other faiths. Governors have claimed that inspectors asked pupils questions including ‘do you know anybody in the school who is gay?’ It is also alleged a girl of around 12 was asked if she was a virgin. Simon Calvert, of The Christian Institute charity, said: ‘It does look like Ofsted inspectors continue to be influenced by this guidance. ‘Sir Michael Wilshaw needs to take responsibility for the actions of his inspectors. He also has to take responsibility for the fact that guidance has been issued that has created a culture within Ofsted where inspectors think it’s appropriate to talk to young children in these ways.’ An Ofsted spokesman said: ‘Last year, Ofsted replaced a number of individual guidance documents with a new, single inspection handbook, in line with our new approach to placing more emphasis on training for inspectors rather than a reliance on extensive written guidance.’","Since 2012 inspectors have been able to quiz pupils about the word 'gay'

"President Obama has again refused to call the battle with terrorism in the Middle East a war against radical Islam. In his latest interview, the Commander-in-Chief agrees certain factions have perverted the religion having embraced a 'nihilistic, violent, almost medieval interpretation of Islam' But he insists that such labels hurt efforts to root out radical ideologies in Muslim communities which have been tainted by groups such as ISIS and Al Qaeda. Scroll down for video . Defiant: President Obama has once again refused to state that the fight against terror in the Middle East was a religious war because the 'overwhelming' majority of Muslims do not support that interpretation . Speaking to CNN's Fareed Zakaria, he said: 'There is an element growing out of Muslim communities in certain parts of the world that have perverted the religion. 'They are doing damage in a lot of countries around the world. 'But I reject a notion that somehow creates a religious war because the overwhelming majority of Muslims reject that interpretation of Islam. They don't even recognize it as being Islam. 'I think for us to be successful in fighting this scurge it's very important to align ourselves with the 99.9 per cent of Muslims.' In January, during a visit from British Prime Minister David Cameron, Obama also refused to call ISIS terrorists Muslims. Following the speech is spokesman released a statement saying:  'Let’s call them what they are. These terrorists are individuals who would like to cloak themselves in the veil of a particular religion. Reasoning: Speaking to CNN' s Fareed Zakaria, he said: 'There is an element growing out of Muslim communities in certain parts of the world that have perverted the religion'. But he rejected the notion it was driven entirely by religion . 'But based on the fact that the religious leaders of that religion have roundly condemned their actions, those religious leaders have indicated that their actions are entirely inconsistent with Islam,' he said. The U.S. President said he does not consider the threat from ISIS an 'existential' one. Earlier this month Senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News: 'We are in a religious war with radical Islamists. When I hear the President of the United States and his chief spokesperson failing to admit that we're in a religious war, it really bothers me .

"Defying the ban: South Carolina's State Education Superintendent Molly Spearman has lifted a complete ban on selling unhealthy snacks in schools . South Carolina schools have partially lifted a ban on junk food in defiance of rules championed by first lady Michelle Obama. State Education Superintendent Molly Spearman has lifted a complete ban on selling unhealthy snacks in schools. Some sales can take place for certain, approved fundraisers, multiple media outlets reported Sunday. The prohibition started last July under the Smart Snacks provision of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Districts protested the ban, saying it hampered the ability of volunteer groups to raise money for activities like field trips. Schools must apply for a waiver to allow snacks that don't meet low-sodium, low-sugar, low-fat limits to be sold in schools on certain days. 'I am pleased to issue guidance today allowing schools to hold a limited number of fundraisers exempt from the federal smart snacks rules,' Spearman wrote in a memo obtained by the Spartanburg Herald Journal. 'The flexibility enables local decision-making, rather than forcing us to follow mandates from the federal government. Schools now have clear, common-sense guidelines in place that will benefit students and local communities.' Spearman's plan will, in its first year, give schools around 90 days during which they may sell candy and other junk food for fundraisers. The second year, they'll be allowed closer to 60 days. The third, they be allowed to sell the non-compliant food around 30 days. South Carolina is among 19 states that grant exemptions to the . This summer, Mrs. Obama said she would fight 'until the bitter end' to make sure kids have good nutrition in schools. South Carolina's lifting of the ban--which the state says will allow 'fundraisers' that include junk food a certain number of schools days per year--comes as part of a backlash against the Michelle Obama-backed Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 . While many schools have implemented the new standards successfully, others have said it's not working for them. The schools pushing for changes say limits on sodium and requirements for more whole grains are particularly challenging, while some school officials say kids are throwing away fruits and vegetables they are required to take. The changes have been pushed by the School Nutrition Association, a group that counts both school nutrition directors and the food companies that produce many of the school foods among its members. The group said this week that a survey it conducted of more than 1,100 school lunch operators showed that more than half predict program expenses will exceed revenue this year. Advocates for the healthier meal standards say the changes will take time. They predict there will be fewer problems as kids get used to the new foods and the food industry creates more tasty products that follow the standards, like whole grain pastas and tortillas that are now required to be served. As schools have complained, USDA has shown some flexibility in tweaking the standards. In 2012, just a few months after the first rules went into effect, the department scrapped maximums on proteins and grains after students complained they were hungry. And USDA said earlier this year that schools can put off for two years a requirement that all pastas in schools be whole-grain rich, or more than half whole grain, if they can demonstrate that they have had 'significant challenges' in preparing the pasta. Despite a barrage of criticism--and a growing trend in which students post their 'gross' lunches with the hashtag #thanksmichelleobama, Mrs. Obama this summer said she would fight 'until the bitter end' to make sure kids have good nutrition in schools .","State Education Superintendent Molly Spearman has lifted a complete ban on selling unhealthy snacks in schools .

"Labour's chief election strategist repeatedly refused to rule out a coalition with the Scottish Nationalists yesterday. Douglas Alexander dodged questions over whether Labour would enter a power-sharing deal with Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond if it fails to win a majority in May. There are increasing signs of a split at the top of the Labour Party over the issue of a deal with the SNP, currently on course to win dozens of Labour seats in Scotland. Scroll down for videos . Douglas Alexander (pictured above with Labour leader Ed Miliband) dodged questions over whether Labour would enter a power-sharing deal with the Scottish Nationalists if Labour failed to win a majority in May . Ed Miliband has been reluctant to rule out a power-sharing arrangement, but shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has suggested he wants to rule one out. Former Scottish First Minister Mr Salmond, who is standing in the general election, said Mr Miliband had managed the ‘remarkable achievement’ of becoming ‘even more unpopular than David Cameron’ in Scotland, a traditional Labour heartland. There has been speculation that Mr Salmond could take a ministerial post in a Labour-SNP coalition – even that of deputy prime minister. He said a formal deal was unlikely but ‘possible’, leaving the door open to SNP MPs propping up a government led by Mr Miliband in exchange for costly concessions. Asked to rule out a Labour-SNP coalition, Mr Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary and head of Labour’s election campaign, said he was ‘not going to play that game”. He conceded the ‘polls are tough’ for Labour but insisted the party was fighting for a majority, telling the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘The fact is after the referendum there were a very significant constituency in Scotland who want change. I share that appetite for change. ‘In the coming election in May the way that we can secure that change is not to split the centre left vote but to deliver the maximum number of Labour MPs and, thereby, make sure we have a progressive government not a government led by David Cameron or a government of David Cameron and Nigel Farage.’ Douglas Alexander dodged questions about a coalition with Nicola Sturgeon (right) and Alex Salmond (left) Mr Alexander suggested Labour would not be prepared to agree to move Trident nuclear weapons from Scotland as part of any negotiations with the SNP after the May 7 election. Shadow Chancellor Mr Balls took a different stance when asked last week if his party could do a deal with the nationalists. He said: ‘No. And I don’t think anybody is suggesting any suggestion of a deal with the SNP at all.’ Asked how the SNP would exploit a hung parliament yesterday, Mr Salmond told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme: ‘The best way to effect change is to negotiate on a vote-by-vote basis. A balanced parliament looks pretty likely at the present moment.’ He said his priority would be to ‘enforce’ the vow made by the main Westminster party leaders during the referendum campaign of devo max for Scotland. The SNP also wanted the cancellation of the Trident nuclear deterrent ‘instead of another bout of austerity from Labour or Conservative’, he said. ‘Diverting that funding, £30billion over the next ten years, into health and education and something useful and productive...I think that will have a lot of support in England as well as in Scotland,’ he added. Jim Murphy, the leader of the Scottish Labour Party, said his party ‘does not want’ a coalition with the SNP. But his deputy Kezia Dugdale has said she would have ‘no qualms whatsoever’. Prime Minister David Cameron said the prospect of a Labour administration being ‘held hostage’ by the SNP was ‘genuinely frightening’. Lucy Powell, the vice chairman of Labour’s election campaign, dismissed claims that Labour MPs had also been talking to Sinn Fein about some sort of accommodation after the election as ‘absolute nonsense’. Last week the Tories used a campaign poster featuring Mr Miliband with Gerry Adams after reports that the party was seeking partners to prop it up in a hung parliament. The Tories put out an election poster last week claiming Ed Miliband could be propped up in Number 10 by the SNP and Sinn Fein. It came after reports the party was seeking partners to prop it up in a hung parliament .","Labour's chief election strategist refused to rule out a coalition with SNP .

"Sheriff's investigators Saturday were reviewing a video of an incident in which hip-hop music mogul Marion 'Suge' Knight hit two men with his pickup truck, killing one, that may help provide clarity on whether Knight was the victim or attacker in his most serious run-in with the law to date. The video is in 'police custody' said Knight's defense attorney James Blatt, and he said he would be seeing it on Monday or Tuesday. He also said it would exonerate his client. Scroll down for videos . This image from video shows Death Row Records founder Marion ""Suge"" Knight, right, walking into the Los Angeles County Sheriffs department early Friday morning . A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department photographer checks the scene of an accident at a parking lot in Compton, Calif. Sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida confirmed that detectives were reviewing the video, but 'they have made no such arrangements with the attorney' nor did they plan to show it to him. Meanwhile, Knight remained jailed on suspicion of murder after turning himself in early Friday. He's being held on $2 million bail. Sheriff's deputies said Knight hit and killed his friend Terry Carter, 55, with his pickup truck Thursday in the parking lot of a Compton fast-food restaurant, also injuring Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, an actor and film consultant who was hospitalized and in stable condition late Friday. Blatt said Knight was an innocent victim who accidentally ran over the men as he tried to escape a vicious attack. The incident was the latest in a long line of brushes with death and the law for the 49-year-old founder of Death Row Records, one of the genre's leading labels. Knight started the label that helped solidify West Coast rap with Dr. Dre, who had been a member of the legendary group N.W.A. The label also launched the career of Snoop Dogg and had Tupac Shakur in the last months of his life. FILE - In this Aug. 15, 1996, file photo, rapper Tupac Shakur, left, and a founder of Death Row Records, Marion ""Suge"" Knight, attend a voter registration event in South Central Los Angeles . The fatal run-in occurred a short while after Knight was told by deputies providing security to leave a film location after arguing with Sloan, who was working on the set, during a break from filming a promotional video for the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" about the rise of N.W.A. The argument resumed and escalated a short while later at a fast-food restaurant a few miles away, with Knight and Sloan exchanging punches through his open window, sheriff's Lt. John Corina said. Corina said Knight backed up his pickup truck and knocked Sloan down. 'Then he puts the truck in drive, drives forward, running over him, and then keeps going forward and keeps on driving, and runs over Carter, who is standing in the parking lot, and keeps on going after that,' Corina said. He said witnesses told investigators it looked like an intentional act. Authorities said they do not believe Carter was involved in the altercation. Blatt said Knight was called to Tam's Burgers in Compton by Carter for a meeting and was attacked by four people, including Sloan, as he slowed his truck. The men beat him through his window, tried to pull him outside, and threatened to kill him. Knight punched the gas and fled in fear, Blatt said. He had no idea he hit two men. Corina said that claim is hard to believe, and there's no evidence thus far of four attackers. The incident came less than six months after Knight was shot six times at a West Hollywood nightclub in August — the second shooting he's survived. No arrests have been made. At 6-foot-4 and weighing 325 pounds, Knight has a reputation as an imposing figure that is credited, in part, with helping create Death Row Records when he strong-armed another label to release Dr. Dre from his contract, said Chuck Creekmur, CEO of allhiphop.com. Knight was at the center of one of the most notorious rap conflicts of the 1990s, pitting Tupac Shakur against Biggie Smalls in an East Coast-versus-West Coast rivalry. Knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with Shakur at a Las Vegas hotel, just hours before Shakur was fatally shot while riding in Knight's car just east of the Strip. Smalls, whose real name was Chris Wallace, was shot to death in a similar attack six months later. Knight and Dre later had a falling out, and Dre left. The record company eventually declared bankruptcy and was auctioned off. Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, another former N.W.A. member, were at the film location Thursday, but they didn't see Knight. In November, Knight pleaded not guilty to a robbery charge filed after a celebrity photographer accused him of stealing her camera in Beverly Hills. Because of prior convictions, he could face up to 30 years in prison.","Suge Knight allegedly 'ran over and killed' Terry Carter, 55, on Thursday afternoon in the parking lot of a burger restaurant .

"She played forthright Nessa in the hit series Gavin & Stacey and it seems Welsh actress and writer Ruth Jones is as plain-spoken as the man-eating trucker in real life, . The star of Sky One's comedy, Stella, 48, has spoken out against having procedures to prevent signs of ageing saying that the injections won't stop time catching up with any of us. Ruth, who lost four and a half stone in 2011, stayed tight-lipped about her transformation in an interview with The Times but she admitted the thought of  Botox injections makes her shudder. Scroll down for video . Actress Ruth Jones, pictured before, left, and after, right losing four stone in 2011, enjoys  facials and spas . She said: 'I'd never judge anyone who did Botox, it's a personal thing. But I wouldn't do it. 'You're either going to have lines or you're going to have a strange, flat forehead. Either way, you're not going to look like you did when you were 25, so I'm going for the lines. 'None of us are going to get younger, there's no point in trying to chase that dream because it won't happen. And I'm too queasy. The thought of putting needles into my forehead... I have facials and I love spas, but that's more about the pampering.' Ruth, who lives in Cardiff with her husband David Peet, slimmed down her physique after years of faddy diets through old fashioned calorie counting. As Nessa, the actress made a virtue of her size 24 curves and a fuller figure was essential for her critically acclaimed role as Hattie Jacques in BBC 4 drama Hattie. She even came to fame in the diet comedy drama Fat Friends, which ran from 2000 to 2005. She has previously talked about her weight loss, saying:  ‘I came back from holiday a couple of years ago – January 2010, and we all overdo it on holiday, don’t we?

"This is the moment a Delta Air Lines pilot told passengers the first officer would be making an emergency landing because he had been locked out of the cockpit. He stood up and calmly addressed the cabin during a flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas on Thursday after the door malfunctioned. After taking a bathroom break, he tried to return to the controls but couldn't get back in, prompting the crew to make a distress call to McCarran International Airport. Announcement: This is the moment a Delta Air Lines pilot told passengers on a flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas the first officer would be making an emergency landing because he had been locked out of the cockpit . Composed: He stood up and calmly addressed the cabin during a flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas after the door malfunctioned . When the co-pilot landed 'perfectly', the 168 passengers on board broke out into applause. Curry Russell who recorded the video  said the situation was 'pretty crazy' but 'pretty exciting'. Another passenger, Jesse Dougherty, told ABC News: 'About half way through [the 2.5-hour flight] there seemed to be some talking at the front of the plane. You could see the captain out there,' 'There wasn't a huge panic but some confusion.' The plane's first officer was forced to make an 'unassisted landing' and did so successfully at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas; those on board were said to have applauded as the plane landed . No one was injured in the emergency landing, which took place at McCarran International Airport at around 12.25pm. The first officer landed the Md-90 aircraft using the controls at his seat as he was more familiar with the layout. However, the first officer's seat doesn't allow access to the plane's taxi controls so the aircraft had to be towed from the runway to the gate, according to passenger Dougherty. Airport spokesman Christine Crews said the first officer completed an 'unassisted landing' which was taken 'very seriously'. She said: 'This was an unusual landing. He called the airport so that we would have ground response available.'","Captain left the cockpit during the flight leaving the first officer in charge .

"A Brazilian beauty contest ended in chaos when the furious runner-up wrenched the crown off the winner's head, and threw it to the ground moments after the result was announced. As Carolina Toledo, 20, was being crowned Miss Amazon 2015, runner-up Sheislane Hayalla saw red as audience members in Manaus, northern Brazil, captured the amazing scenes on camera. Other participants looked on in horror as the 23-year-old contestant  ripped out the tiara, threw it to the ground, pointed an accusing finger at her adversary and insulted her before storming off stage. Scroll down for video . The astonishing moment a runner-up in a beauty contest grabbed the crown from her rival's head, smashing it towards the floor in a fit of rage at the Miss Amazon competition in Manaus, northern Brazil . Rivals: Miss Toledo (left) had just been crowned Miss Amazon when her competitor Sheislane Hayalla (right) swiped the tiara from her head and threw it to the ground . Distraught organisers rushed to pick up the crown and put it back on law student Carolina's head as security officials rushed backstage to reach her attacker. The amazing incident took place on Friday night at a convention centre in Manaus, the Amazon's largest city and the venue for England's World Cup opener against Italy in June. On Saturday, Miss Hayalla claimed her rival had bought her way to the title, insisting: 'Money talks in Manaus and I wanted to show the Amazon people money doesn't talk here. 'She didn't deserve the title.' The winner declined to comment on the incident and would only say: 'This is an unbelievable feeling. I don't have words to explain the way I feel.' Miss Hayalla can be seen throwing the crown to the floor in a video filmed by a member of the audience . Anger: Defending her actions, Miss Hayalla claimed her rival had bought her way to the title . The Miss Amazon winner will now represent her state in the national Miss Brazil beauty contest. Organisers of the competition are deciding whether to punish the runner-up, who would normally be expected to participate in events throughout the year in representation of her state. Miss Amazon winners normally do well in the national competition. Terezinha Morango, the 1957 winner, went on to win Miss Brazil before coming second in the Miss Universe contest of the same year. Twelve women took part in this year's final. The winner won her place in the final by triumphing in the local Miss Manaus beauty contest. Model and biology student Sheislane had won beauty contests in 2013 and last year. An annual contest to find the sexiest bottom in Brazil was rocked by scandal just under two years ago when two of the candidates were accused of bribing judges to rig the votes. Rivals accused Miss Bumbum finalists Mari Sousa, 25, and Eliana Amaral, 24, of paying thousands of pounds to the event's judging panel for the right to come first and second. Dai Macedo, 25, from the central state of Goias, ended up being crowned the winner with her 42in derriere while Eliana Amaral, from Pernambuco in north Brazil, was awarded second place.","Miss Amazon 2015 runner-up ripped crown of the winning beauty .

"Nancy Lanza, Adam Lanza's mom, comes was, in part, blamed for contributing to the tragedy by fostering her son's fascination with guns . A Connecticut panel developing a report on the Newtown school massacre has staged a debate on whether the final death toll of victims should include the shooter's mother. The difficult decision on whether to include Nancy Lanza, Adam Lanza's mom, comes after she was, in part, blamed for contributing to the tragedy by fostering her son's fascination with guns. Her son, Adam Lanza began his horrific rampage on December 14, 2012, by killing his mom inside their Newtown home before gunning down 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School. He then turned the gun on himself, committing suicide. To date, a draft of the dedication for the Sandy Hook Advisory Commission's report references 26 victims - which include 20 innocent first graders and six teachers. But commissioner Harold Schwartz asked at a hearing if Nancy Lanza should not also be considered a victim. Although the commission ultimately agreed to leave her name out, Schwartz suggested mentioning her at least in a footnote. Schwartz, a psychiatry professor at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine said: 'I'm not certain it is morally right to not acknowledge her as a victim.' The role of Nancy Lanza, who often took her son to shooting ranges and bought the rifle he would use in the school massacre, has been a difficult one for Newtown. Scroll down for video . Shooter: Inside the large yellow house with green shutters on Yogananda Street is where Adam Lanza, pictured shot his mother to death before killing 20 first-graders and six educators at nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School. He then committed suicide. Residence: Officials in Newtown have voted to tear down the home where Adam Lanza lived with his mom Nancy Lanza before he carried out the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School (2012 file photo) Some friends have said she did her best raising a troubled son, but a report by the state's Office of the Child Advocate concluded she contributed to his isolation as she kept him at home. There, he was surrounded by an arsenal of firearms as he whiled away hours playing violent video games. Last week,officials in Newtown voted  to tear down the home where Adam Lanza lived before he carried out the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The vote by the Newtown Legislative Council approved a proposal by the board of selectmen to raze the 3,100-square-foot home and keep the land as open space. However, Commission chairman, Scott Jackson, the mayor of Hamden, said it is impossible to know how much responsibility Nancy Lanza bears. 'I think that's why number 27 is always so difficult, because there's so much we don't know,' Jackson said. Crime scene: Sandy Hook Elementary School was demolished in 2013 after the horrific events there . Loss: A man kneels at a shrine deicated to the victims of Sandy Hook, Commissioner Adrienne Bentman asked how other victims' families might feel about seeing Nancy Lanza's name  with those of their loved ones . The advisory commission, created by Governor Dannel P. Malloy in the wake of the shooting, plans to issue its report in February with dozens of policy recommendations. They will include law enforcement and emergency response, school design and mental health and wellness. And, after the suggestion to adjust the death toll, several commission members said they wanted to leave the dedication intact for just the 26 people killed at the school. Commissioner Adrienne Bentman asked how other victims' families might feel about seeing Nancy Lanza's name on the same page with those of their loved ones.","Nancy Lanza, Adam Lanza's mom, was in part, blamed for the massacre .

"Even as the biggest sporting event of the year approached, ESPN took a moment to remember its veteran broadcaster, Stuart Scott, who died from cancer earlier last month. Emotional colleagues shed tears as they described the passion and kindness of their colleague, who died on 4 January at the age of 49. Host Suzy Kolber recalled Scott, who covered the Super Bowl for years, holding her baby daughter the day she was born, and how she did the same for his daughter, Taelor. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Long-time colleague Suzy Kolber (left) broke down in tears as she remembered Stuart Scott (right) in a Super Bowl preview show Sunday . Touching: Kolber shared this image of Scott holding her daughter Kellyn at her first NFL game, when she was nine months old . Sharing a picture of him holding Kellyn at her first NFL game, she said: 'When Kellyn was nine months old, she came to her very first NFL game - and I just always thought that picture was magical. 'So, what will I miss the most? He was universally known for his hugs? Strong, meaningful and filled with love.' 'We can't replace that, but we were happy we had him in our lives. But the legacy lives on, which of course is what Stuart was all about too.' Kolber and Scott had a 20-year working relationship. On the field: The 2002 Super Bowl, above, was one of many Scott covered. He is pictured interviewing New England Patriots quarterback Drew Blesdoe . Another host said: 'We were grateful for the spirit of Stu, it was undaunted, indomitable, and we're grateful'. The ESPN hosts also reminded viewers of Scott's fund with the Jimmy V Foundation foundation, dedicated to helping disadvantaged groups fight cancer. During his career at the network, which began in 1993, Scott covered practically every major sporting event. He interviewed sporting heroes like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods - as well as scoring a segment with Barack Obama, whom he played at basketball in the run-up to his 2008 victory. President Obama issued a tribute to Scott on the day that he died, revealing his ESPN shows often kept him entertained on the campaign trail. Tributes all round: All the hosts of ESPN's Countdown show paid their respects to their colleague, who died of an unspecified cancer last month . Big fan: Scott is pictured above playing basketball with Barack Obama when he was a presidential candidate . He was diagnosed with cancer in 2007, and became a figurehead in his struggle with a disease, inspiring many. However, he never revealed what kind of cancer he was fighting. Scott was noted for carrying on working even in some of the worst periods of his disease. On the day of his death, ESPN president John Skipper described Scott as 'a true friend and a uniquely inspirational figure' and that his 'energetic and unwavering devotion to his family and to his work while fighting the battle of his life left us in awe, and he leaves a void that can never be replaced.' He continued: 'Who engages in mixed martial arts training in the midst of chemotherapy treatments? Who leaves a hospital procedure to return to the set?' Scott was survived by his parents, O. Ray and Jacqueline Scott; siblings Stephen Scott, Synthia Kearney and Susan Scott; his daughters Taelor, 19, and Sydni, 15; and girlfriend Kristin Spodobalski.","Hosts, including friend Suzy Kolber, spoke warmly of Scott on Sunday .

"Until a stranger's act of kindness turned his fortunes around forever, Alan Barnes's life had been a hard luck story. Born disabled, he has suffered from sight and growth problems, never been able to work and his distinctive appearance attracts stares in the street. When a mugger pushed him to the ground outside his home and broke his collar bone, the 67-year-old was determined to soldier on as he's always done. But local beautician Katie Cutler heard about the cowardly attack and set up an online appeal to raise £500 to help the unfortunate Mr Barnes. Scroll down for video . Alan Barnes, who was mugged as he put the bins out outside his Gateshead home, has met Katie Cutler who set up a fundraising page to help him and the appeal has raised £281,000 for the pensioner . Miss Cutler had a tearful meeting with Mr Barnes at his sister's home in North Tyneside, where he is staying . Donations to the fund have now reached £281,000, with more than 21,000 people donating . So far the appeal has already passed £281,000 – and is still rising by the hour. Mr Barnes, who is very frail, just over 4ft tall and weighs around six stone, has been overwhelmed by the response from well-wishers across the globe. The donations mean he can buy a house of his own for the first time and not count the pennies to get through the week. And yesterday, he got the chance to thank Miss Cutler, 21, in person when she visited him at his sister's home in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. Amid emotional scenes, Miss Cutler gave him a hug and held his hand as they chatted on the sofa. 'I am totally overwhelmed and incredibly grateful to Katie for what she has done for me,' he said. 'The youth of today don't always get portrayed in a positive light, but I won't ever forget what this young woman has done for me. This is the best thing that has ever happened to me. 'I always knew there were good people in the world, and this has confirmed it.' Speaking about the 'unbelievable' fundraising response, he said money was usually only donated on that scale for charity disaster appeals. The heart-warming appeal has been a testament to the power of the internet and social media. There have been around 20,000 public donations in just four days, and have come from as far afield as New Zealand, USA, South Africa and Canada. Mr Barnes said he had wanted to meet Miss Cutler ever since he found out about the fundraising she started . Mr Barnes and Miss Cutler had an emotional encounter as they talked about the attack on the pensioner . Mr Barnes said the selfless act by Miss Cutler and other people who had donated had restored his faith . Speaking this morning, the pair also revealed that local lawyers and tradesmen have offered their services for free after hearing of Mr Barnes's ordeal. Mr Barnes told BBC Breakfast: 'A solicitor from Gosforth has offered advice and I will just have to take it from there, but it will be put to good use.' And Miss Cutler added: 'A full kitchen has been offered, a conservatory, a bathroom. There's an electrician, a tiler - you name it ... everything.' Shop manager of Tantobie store in County Durham, Addy Awam, has offered to deliver a weekly food shop to his home. He said: 'My gesture isn't anything special but I just want to play my part and help Alan in the best way I can. 'Anything that I sell in my shop I can get to him. I will drop it off at his house if he is unable to collect it. 'I don't care if it's one order or five orders, I'll do this for the whole week. Paul Sutherst, manager of Accomplished Plastering, based in Wallsend, Newcastle has also offered his services. He said: 'It's best for the whole city to just stick together now at a time like this and get him back to his best. 'There are some nasty people who could do something like this to a man who can't defend himself. 'If he needs any plastering or tiling then we'll sort it out for him. We'll do the lot for nothing, he deserves the support. Bless him.' Paul Stephenson, manager of Smilers Removals in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear has offered Mr Barnes his full support with moving him into his new home. The 40-year-old said: 'I have a removal business and I know he was looking for a new home so I thought I could offer him that. We'll get him into his new home safe and well. Anything he needs moving, packed up, and taken to his new place we've got that covered.' The pair appeared on BBC Breakfast this morning to discuss their heart-warming encounter . Many donors have written messages of encouragement for Mr Barnes on Katie's fundraising page. 'It is just amazing, a simple thank you doesn't cover it,' he said. 'It was a total surprise and I can't believe the generosity being shown.' Mr Barnes said he would think very carefully about how to spend the money, but promised: 'I can tell you one thing, it won't be wasted, I am always very careful with money and won't be spending it on flashy holidays, I just want to feel safe again.' Yesterday Miss Cutler, who set up the appeal on fundraising website Go Fund Me after reading about the crime online, sobbed as she presented Mr Barnes with a get well card and chocolates. She said: 'I hope that he can get a house with this money. I am really overwhelmed to be here. It is lovely. 'It doesn't feel real to be honest. I knew I would get upset when I saw him, but it is happy tears. When I read that he was scared that he did not want to go back to his home, I knew I had to do something to help. I never thought it would take off in this way. I am thrilled that it has done.' Miss Cutler and Mr Barnes have spoken of their amazement at the reaction to the fundraising appeal . Well-wishers have started a separate fund, currently worth £580, to raise money for Miss Cutler to go on holiday - but she said she would refuse the cash because other people are more deserving. The campaign's founder Catherine Kirkley wrote: 'We all know Katie has done a wonderful job for Alan. Let's help her have a wonderful holiday x'. And donor Dennis Price added: 'Katie, for as long as I can remember, the news has been unrelentingly awful, with wars, unrest, social injustice and a hundred other ills and tragedies from Britain and around the world beamed into our living rooms. 'Alan Barnes suffered his misfortune as well, which disgusted everyone who heard of it, but you did something about it, despite not knowing him personally. 'Your kind and selfless act for this poor man has led to his life being transformed for the better, while seeing the generosity and warmth of all the people who have contributed to the fund you set up has made the whole country feel better.' But in response to the fundraising, Miss Cutler replied: 'Hello everyone, this is so incredibly kind but I really can't accept anything. I have my full life to work and I can't help but feel that there are people out there who would really need it.' There is also a Facebook campaign for the generous mother to be awarded an OBE to honour her fundraising efforts. Under the Go Fund Me rules, Miss Cutler and Mr Barnes can request access to the funds which have been donated at any time, and it will be paid to them within a week. Some supporters have called for the website to waive its five per cent fee on the donations - set to add up to at least £14,000. One donor, Richard John Darling, said: 'I couldn't live with myself if I made loads of money for myself from raising money for charity... Go Fund Me should be ashamed if they go ahead and make £20K+.' Miss Cutler said she found the experience emotional but said her tears were 'happy tears' at their meeting . Mr Barnes has been unable to carry out his normal routine because his right arm has been in a sling . Mr Barnes has been staying with his sister and her family since the attack - including his niece Georgi Galloway and great niece Florence Purvis . Mr Barnes's disabilities were put down to his mother contracting German measles during pregnancy. He avoided being bullied during his childhood by going to a special school for disabled children. But he has never had a job due to his disabilities and instead has done voluntary work for his local church. A popular figure in his community, residents said he is a good mathematician and renowned for being able to quickly calculate how many days old someone is by using their date of birth. The pensioner, who lived alone in a council house in Gateshead, was set upon by a mugger as he put his bins out at 6.30pm last Sunday. He was knocked to the floor and left lying there after the thief demanded money and searched his pockets to find them empty, before fleeing the scene. Mr Barnes stumbled to a neighbour's house and rang his sister who took him to hospital, and has been too scared to return to his home since. Police have appealed for information to catch the mugger. Detective Constable Chris Neil said: 'This was a cowardly assault on a vulnerable man who wasn't able to defend himself. His disability means he is partially sighted and quite short and it's disgraceful that someone would target him.'","Alan Barnes is disabled and was born with sight and growth problems .

"As many as twelve Australians are on death row overseas facing possible execution, not including Bali Nine leaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan. According to Fairfax, the dozen Australians, including two grandmothers, have all committed serious crimes abroad which carry the death penalty and they could be next to face the executioner. The unlucky twelve are in addition to the Bali Nine duo and Pham Trung Dung, who is on death row in Vietnam for trafficking heroin. Scroll down for video . As many as twelve Australians are on death row overseas facing possible execution, not including Bali Nine leaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . According to Fairfax, a 71-year-old grandmother is among the twelve inmates possibly facing execution overseas. It is understood that the majority of the cases are related to drug trafficking offences. In a report released to Fairfax, the Department of Foreign Affairs is noted as being heavily involved with many of the cases. However, speaking to the publication, the Department of Foreign Affairs said it did not play a part in any of the twelve cases. 'These figures are subject to revision and represent the best of our knowledge. As a matter of policy we do not disclose the names or locations of these consular clients,' a spokesman for DFAT said. While the DFAT declined to comment on individual cases, the report stated that it had helped with the investigations of 239 'potential death' cases in the past three years. Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, were arrested in 2005 when they attempted to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia . Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, were arrested in 2005 when they attempted to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia. Despite their attempts to rehabilitate themselves behind bars, they are both now facing death by firing squad in Indonesia. They have appealed for clemency from the Indonesian government with an Australian campaign founded by friend and artist Ben Quilty supporting them from their home country. Death row inmate Pham Trung Dung, an Australian of Vietnamese origin, was arrested in May 2013 when custom officials reportedly found four kilograms of heroin in his luggage as he was boarding a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Australia. Peter Gardner, 25, remains behind bars in China on drug-smuggling charges which carry the death penalty . A court heard in June 2014 that Dung had been living in Australia with his partner, To Quyen, since 2000 and travelled to Vietnam with her and his two sons in 2013 to visit family. It was in Vietnam that Dung reportedly agreed to transport two bags  of heroin given to him by an acquaintance to take to another acquaintance in Australia. According to online paper VnExpress, Dung said he knew it was illegal but could not pass up the $40,000 payout. Up until now, the public were only aware of two other Australians who were possibly facing execution - Sydney man Peter Gardner and Australian mother of four Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto. Gardner made headlines last year when he was arrested for allegedly attempting to traffic 30 kilograms of methamphetamine, also known as the drug ice out of China. The 25-year-old was taken into custody along with Kalynda Davies, also from Sydney, who has since returned to Australia. Guangzhou Customs claim they found the drugs in 60 vacuum-sealed bags inside Gardner's luggage while he was on his way to Sydney on Flight CZ325, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. His two pieces of hand luggage had to be forced open by authorities in an interrogation room in Baiyun Airport as the zippers were super glued. It is believed to be the most ice local customs have ever found leaving the country. In another case of drug trafficking abroad, Australian mother Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto, 52, was arrested on December 7 after arriving at Kuala Lumpur International Airport en route from Shanghai to Melbourne. Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto, 52, (C) is escorted by a Malaysian customs officer as she leaves the Magistrate Court in Sepang, near Kuala Lumpur . A routine customs check discovered a hidden compartment in a bag she carried, which contained 1.5 kilogrammes (3.3 pounds) of suspected crystal methamphetamine, or 'ice' A routine customs check discovered a hidden compartment in a bag she carried, which contained 1.5 kilogrammes (3.3 pounds) of suspected crystal methamphetamine, or 'ice'. Her lawyer has since protested her innocence, claiming Ms Exposto had become involved in an online romance with a person claiming to be a US serviceman. She reportedly travelled to Shanghai to meet him, only to discover that another person had been posing as her supposed love interest. It was there that she was tricked into carrying the drugs, her lawyer said.","Up to 12 Australians are facing the death penalty abroad .

"Bristol will today become the first UK city to pilot outdoor smoke-free areas. Millennium Square and Anchor Square now have voluntary cigarette bans after a poll found 61 per cent of locals were in favour of the idea. New York, Toronto and Hong Kong already have similar bans in key outdoor locations. The British trial has been set up by the local government group Smoke-free South West. Scroll down for video . Bristol's Millennium Square (pictured) now has a voluntary cigarette ban in place after locals voted in favour . It has placed signs in the popular harbourside squares, thanking people for keeping the areas smoke-free, healthy and clean. It expects the scheme to police itself. Mother Kirsty Vass, 33, inspired the smokefree pilot in Bristol after being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) a year ago when one of her lungs collapsed. Ms Vass, who smoked 20 cigarettes a day for more than 15 years, is now constantly short of breath, unable to travel and has to be supported by her 15-year-old daughter, Lucy. 'My smoking illness has caused my whole world to come crashing down,' Ms Vass, of Torbay, Devon, said. 'If young people see you smoking then they think its alight, but they don't understand what it can do to you, so making smoking less visible in public places can only be a good thing. 'I don't want other people to be like me because this isn't a life, it's a life sentence. If I can make people realise that this is what smoking does to you then please, please, please quit now because it's really not worth it, especially if you've got kids.' Daniella Radice, assistant mayor for Public Health at Bristol City Council, added: 'I am excited to see how this pilot can change people's habits and make Bristol an even more enjoyable place to live and to visit' Director Fiona Andrews said: 'These squares are often full of children playing, and this will provide a smoke-free environment for them to enjoy.' Councillor Daniella Radice, assistant mayor for Public Health at Bristol City Council, added: 'In this year that Bristol is proud to be the European Green Capital, I am excited to see how this pilot can change people's habits and make Bristol an even more enjoyable place to live and to visit.'

"Labour went to war with Boots yesterday after the chemist chain warned of catastrophe if the party won the general election. Stefano Pessina, the firm’s acting boss, said Ed Miliband’s policies were ‘not helpful for business and not helpful for the country’. Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna hit back with a series of extraordinary attacks on Mr Pessina and his firm, which has 70,000 UK workers. He questioned whether Boots paid enough tax while fellow Labour MPs said they would not listen to a multi-millionaire who lived in ‘a big mansion’. Scroll down for video . Boots chief Stefano Pessina (left) has warned it would be a 'catastrophe' if Labour and Ed Miliband (right) win power. Pessina claimed Miliband’s policies were ‘not helpful for business and not helpful for the country’ Boots, which has 70,000 UK workers, came under fire from senior Labour figures after the attack on its business policies . The extreme response will fuel claims that the party is anti-business and raise further doubts over Mr Miliband’s election strategy. The reaction also showed ‘staggering immaturity’ on the part of the Labour leadership, according to a former party adviser. As chaos in the Labour ranks escalated: . Labour’s uneasy relationship with business exploded into the open thanks to the intervention of Mr Pessina, who heads Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, owner of the biggest chain of UK chemists. It is highly unusual for captains of industry to be so outspoken this close to an election. But Mr Miliband has announced a series of policies taking aim at what he calls capitalist ‘predators’ across a range of industries from energy suppliers to private landlords. Mr Pessina said: ‘If they acted as they speak, it would be a catastrophe. 'The problem is, would they act that way or not? One thing is to threaten and to shout, but it is completely different to be in charge and to manage the country day to day.’ Labour has previously had close links with Boots – former health secretary Patricia Hewitt worked for it as an adviser. Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna hit back at with a series of extraordinary attacks on Mr Pessina and his firm . But last night Labour MPs tweeted criticisms of Mr Pessina, a 73-year-old Italian who is estimated to have a £7.5billion fortune. Ilford South MP Mike Gapes wrote: ‘Does Boots boss own a big mansion in UK? Does he pay income tax in UK? Does he vote in UK?’ Mr Umunna said: ‘It is important that the voice of business is heard during this general election campaign, not least on Europe. 'But the British people and British businesses will draw their own conclusions when those who don’t live here, don’t pay tax in this country and lead firms that reportedly avoid making a fair contribution in what they pay purport to know what is in Britain’s best interests.’ But former Labour adviser Dan Hodges said attacking Boots was a ‘mad, pitch-to-the-Greens and the left’ strategy, adding: ‘The immaturity that surrounds Labour’s political decision-making is simply staggering.’ Former Labour Cabinet minister Alan Milburn (left) and John Hutton have attacked Mr Miliband's leadership . John Mills, Labour’s biggest individual donor, said reports he had criticised Mr Miliband were ‘pure mischief-making’ but went on to raise doubts about key policies. ‘It is true that I have gone on record to say that I think that widening the council tax bands is better than having a mansion tax,’ he said. ‘I also have said there are problems about planning something like a mansion tax for the NHS rather than using money raised locally for local purposes – particularly building more housing.’ A spokesman for Walgreens Boots Alliance insisted Mr Pessina’s comments had been taken out of context, adding: ‘He is not campaigning against Ed Miliband or Labour.’ The company has been accused of trying to cut its UK tax bill by moving its HQ to Switzerland. Founded 165 years ago, Boots merged with European pharmacy business Alliance UniChem in 2006 and with US giant Walgreens last year. In its final year on the London Stock Exchange, Alliance Boots declared a tax bill of £89million. This had dropped to around £9million by 2010. The firm’s spokesman said it was now paying more tax than it had as a listed company. Opera lover: Boots boss Stefano Pessina . Known as the ‘silver fox’ to both friends and foes, Boots boss Stefano Pessina is a secretive Italian billionaire who lives in Monaco. According to the respected Forbes magazine rich list, he is worth £7.56billion. Last year he engineered a merger between Alliance Boots, which owns Boots UK, and Walgreens, which made him £4.45billion richer. Born into a Milanese family in 1941, Pessina lives close to other high rollers including Sir Philip Green in Monte Carlo. Unlike some of his more colourful neighbours, Pessina is not known for his love of lavish parties and keeps a low profile. He prefers opera, art and boat design – his main extravagance is a yacht moored off Sardinia – and keeps fit with sailing, tennis and swimming. Following a degree and research jobs in nuclear engineering at university in Milan and a stint in marketing, Pessina won his first role in the business world when his father asked him in 1974 to restructure the ailing family company, a pharmaceutical wholesaler. Now, at the age of 73, he has 1,500 deals under his belt and claims he maintains the elixir of youth by ‘building businesses’ – rather than using any anti-ageing serums found on the shelves of Boots. The father-of-two shares his home with his partner, Ornella Barra, 60, who is also a senior executive at the company. They have been called the planet’s most formidable corporate power-couple. Far from contemplating retirement, Pessina has his sights set on new markets. ‘We are very active in China, we are looking at Latin America. 'And sometimes we have been able to do deals in Turkey, in Egypt, in Russia, in Thailand. Sometime in the future I will have to stop and someone else will have to continue. That’s life.’","Ed Miliband under growing pressure after a series of attacks on leadership .

"A grandfather has been swept out to sea while scattering the ashes of his dead sister. Shane Galliers, 51, met relatives to say a last goodbye to his sister, Michelle Galliers, who died in November. After waiting for the tide to go out, each scattered some of her ashes on the beach near Tintagel on the north Cornwall coast. But Mr Galliers walked away to say a private farewell.

As he stood at the water’s edge on Saturday at 5pm, a large wave hit the father of one and he slipped down a bank into the water. A relative went to help him, and was swept out to sea himself before making it back. But Mr Galliers, a grandfather of four from Launceston, disappeared. After rescue efforts were called off yesterday, his mother, Patricia Howells, spoke of her devastation at losing another child. She said: ‘The family were all meeting at Trebarwith Strand. The sea was very rough. ‘In the end we decided it would be safer to go up to a little river on the beach and do it there. ‘Michelle wanted her ashes scattered on the beach as that’s where her grandmother and uncle are.

We didn’t even know he was there. The first we knew about it was when someone shouted, “There’s someone in the water”. 'We didn’t think it could be any of our group as we were all together, but then we realised it was Shane. ‘His sister’s husband tried to reach him but he ended up slipping in too. Luckily the tide dragged him the other way and he was able to get out. ‘Unfortunately, Shane couldn’t stay afloat. It was so cold, we were very well wrapped up. He was wearing very thick clothes. They just dragged him down. ‘It’s all a very big shock. First I lost my daughter and now I have lost my son, it’s so difficult to come to terms with.’ Yesterday, a spokesman for the Maritime & Coastguard Agency said: ‘The search for the man who was washed into the sea, co-ordinated by Falmouth Coastguard, has finished.

"It may not be very politically correct, but a Melbourne company scared the daylights out of their counterparts in Los Angeles during a Skype conference call by making it sound as if their office was under an air attack as sirens blared in the background. After the LA office of Luma Pictures pranked their Melbourne office by pretending to be in the middle of an earthquake during a Skype call, their Australian co-workers in Melbourne decided to retaliate by acting out an air raid during one of their regularly scheduled digital meetings.

"Eddie Perez, 19, was taken into custody on Saturday night is facing a list of charges including false imprisonment, kidnapping, rape and torture . A 19-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly raping his 16-year-old girlfriend and beating her with a tire iron over five days. Eddie Perez, 19, was taken into custody on Saturday night and is facing a list of charges including false imprisonment, kidnapping, rape and torture. Sgt. Justin Vallin says the girl's family reported that she had run away about two weeks ago from Avenal. Investigators believe she was with Perez, but the relationship turned violent when he accused her of cheating on him several days ago. Police said that Perez held the girl in his car, and she was able to signal a passerby for help on Friday afternoon while he was away. Witnesses say the victim was found screaming in a car, unable to move from being beaten so badly, reports ABC7. Albert Martinez, who found her in the car, told the station: 'I wasn't sure what the situation was, so I did slowly approach the car. 'She asked if she could use a phone, so I asked her what the situation was. 'She was really panicked, and crying and really scared.'

"More than a third of children now live with unmarried parents in non-traditional families, according to official figures. Only 63 per cent of dependent youngsters lived in a home headed by a married couple last year, according to the Office for National Statistics – a drop of three percentage points on 2004. By contrast, the proportion of dependent children – classed as under-16s and those aged 16 to 18 in school or college – living with cohabiting parents rose over the same period from 11 per cent to 14 per cent. New figures show only 63 per cent of dependent youngsters lived in a home headed by a married couple last year (file picture) The fall in the share of children in married homes comes at a time of growing evidence that marriage is linked with health and wealth among both parents and children, while cohabiting couples are more likely to have lower incomes. Children of married couples are more likely than those with unmarried parents to do well at school and enjoy good health, and to go on to higher education and well-paid jobs. David Cameron has promised to introduce more state support for marriage. However, the tax break for poorer married parents to be offered this spring has been described by some critics as ‘ridiculous’. It will mean that 1.6million people who are not higher-rate taxpayers will get only £3.85 a week. Analysts believe that in practice the gain will be even less for more than a million of these people, because for them Coalition benefit reforms will take away £2.50 of the gain. The fall in the share of children in married homes comes at a time of growing evidence that marriage is linked with health and wealth (file picture) The Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne have also declined to shift towards fully transferable income tax allowances which advocates of marriage demand. The ONS report on Families And Households 2014 said there were 13.8million dependent children in Britain in 2014, 560,000 more than in 2004. The increase is a result of high immigration and high birth rates, pushed up by immigration. It said: ‘The types of families in which dependent children live have changed significantly. The biggest change is for dependent children living in opposite sex cohabiting couple families. ‘Over the same period, the percentage of dependent children living in a married couple family fell by three percentage points to 63 per cent in 2014.’ The share of children living with single parents remained at roughly the same level over the decade. Last year, according to figures from the ONS Labour Force Survey, 23 per cent of dependent children were living with lone parents. Patricia Morgan, an author on cohabitation and the family, said: ‘This is a disastrous direction to be taking. It is something that has not been tackled by the Government because acting to back marriage is seen as politically incorrect. ‘David Cameron is happy to act in favour of same-sex marriage, but he seems not to want to help opposite sex couples raising children.’ She added: ‘Marriage is under a cloud, but it is better for parents, children, the national budget, and the welfare of the rest of us.’ Children of cohabiting parents are more likely than those of married parents to end up in a broken or single-parent family, as cohabitees are between three and four times more likely to break up than married couples.","Number of children living in a home with married parents drops by 3% .

"Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee says gay marriage is akin to alcohol and profanity — options the Republican weighing a 2016 presidential bid says are appealing to others, but not to him. Huckabee on Sunday also told CNN's 'State of the Union' that forcing people of faith to accept gay marriage as policy is on par with telling Jews that they must serve 'bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli.' That dish would run afoul of kosher rules. 'We're so sensitive to make sure that we don't offend certain religions but then we act like Christians can't have the convictions that they've had for over 2,000 years,' Huckabee added. Not a supporter: Former Arkansas Gov Mike Huckabee appeared on CNN's 'State of the Union' to discuss the topic of gay marriage . Huckabee says he appreciates different viewpoints on gay marriage, adding that he is friends with gay people. 'People can be my friends who have lifestyles that are not necessarily my lifestyles. I don't shut people out of my circle or out of my life because they have a different point of view,' Huckabee explained. 'I don't drink alcohol but a lot of my friends - maybe most of them - do. I don't use profanity but believe me, I've got a lot of friends who do.' Huckabee has made cultural issues the cornerstone of his likely presidential bid. The former Baptist pastor is counting on social conservatives and evangelicals who have great clout in early nominating Iowa to help his bid. When asked if the rising tide of support for gay marriage should lead to more Republicans backing legalization in the party - Huckabee said he wasn't opposed as long as the party doesn't  'change its overall view'.

Authorities say Buryakov's activities, as well as those of his alleged cohorts Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy, indicate a continued Russian spy presence in the country . Real threat: U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara says the threat of Russian espionage is real, over 20 years after the end of the Cold War . 'Russian spies continue to seek to operate in our midst,' U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara warned after the arrests last week. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich countered by accusing U.S. authorities of manufacturing a spy scandal as part of its 'anti-Russian campaign.' Annemarie McAvoy, a Fordham Law professor and former federal prosecutor, said the latest case shouldn't be taken lightly. 'We have to be concerned about the economic warfare end of this. That's what worries me,' she said, noting the recent crippling cyberattack on Sony Pictures involving the movie 'The Interview.' She said the arrests might demonstrate that the spy game has changed as countries seek information to poise themselves to attack businesses and the economy. 'It's not looking for military secrets. That's almost passe now,' McAvoy said. The case against Evgeny Buryakov, Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy comes less than five years after the arrest of 10 covert agents - a sleeper cell referred to as 'The Illegals' by the SVR, the foreign intelligence agency headquartered in Moscow - who led ordinary lives for several years in the United States using aliases. All 10 pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to conspiracy charges and were ordered out of the country as part of a spy swap for four people convicted of betraying Moscow to the West. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn brought another spy case in 2013, accusing Alexander Fishenko, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Kazakhstan who made millions off his Texas export firm, of being a secret agent for the Russian military. Fishenko, who pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to go to trial later this year. Not everyone views the latest case as a scary new wrinkle in spy tactics. 'What is interesting about this case, just like the 2010 sleeper spy case, is how little these accused Russian spies are accomplishing. Either the FBI is just getting the low-hanging fruit, or the Russian foreign intelligence agency isn't doing its job very well,' said Kimberly Marten, a political scientist at Barnard College, Columbia University. Prosecutors say the latest investigation exposed espionage by Sporyshev and Podobnyy, who held low-level diplomatic positions, and Buryakov, a Bronx resident with a valid visa, a position in the Manhattan branch of a Russian bank and a LinkedIn profile. No joke: Authorities claim spies like those in this latest case are in the U.S. to undermine the country's economic foundations . U.S. prosecutors say that under orders from Moscow, Sporyshev's main duty was to give Buryakov assignments to gather intelligence on potential U.S. sanctions against Russian banks and efforts here to develop alternative energy resources. They say Sporyshev and Podobnyy would analyze the information and report back to the SVR behind the walls of a Russian Federation office in New York they thought was secure but apparently was bugged. In a secretly recorded conversation, Podobnyy let down his guard and complained to Sporyshev that their work was nothing like 'movies about James Bond,' according to the papers. 'Of course, I wouldn't fly helicopters, but pretend to be someone else at a minimum,' he said. Sporyshev griped that he too thought he 'at least would go abroad with a different passport.' The court papers also detail demands on Buryakov from SVR to come up with questions for a Russian 'news organization' - believed to be Tass - to ask about the inner workings of the U.S. stock market. The conversation was an exception to how the pair normally did business, prosecutors said. Typically, they would speak on the phone in code to set up meetings in outdoor settings, with 'Buryakov passing a bag, magazine or slip of paper to Sporyshev,' court papers said. Some of the meetings took place near Buryakov's red-brick home on a quiet block in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, not far from a monolithic high-rise used to house Russian diplomats. Economic warfare? Authorities worry that the presence of spies like Buryakov, Sporyshev and Podobnyy could undermine the countries economic security . Evgeny Buryakov, 39, masked this work by posing as a banker for Russia's Vnesheconombank, (pictured) according to the complaint and the bank's website . Neighbors said 39-year-old Buryakov, his wife and two children largely kept to themselves. They recalled a man sitting in a car on the block for hours at a time - in hindsight, they say, probably surveillance - but were surprised when the FBI raided the home last Monday. 'I got home from work and saw all these cars, about 10 of them, blocking the street. One blocked my driveway,' said Damian McShane, who lives across the street. 'We didn't know what was happening.' A judge ordered Buryakov held without bail. Podobnyy and Sporyshev, whose diplomatic status gave them immunity, have returned to Russia. Tass reported that Russian diplomats had visited Buryakov in a federal lockup in lower Manhattan and found conditions of his confinement 'satisfactory.' A Russian spokesman told the news agency that Buryakov 'vehemently denies the alleged offenses.'

"More agony: Photos of the  victim of Ched Evans (pictured) have been posted online, say reports . Photos of Ched Evans'  rape victim have resurfaced online and been viewed thousands of times, it was claimed today. The revelation is a fresh trauma for the woman, who has already been in hiding for more than two years after she was raped by the former footballer in a hotel room in 2012. Despite Evans being convicted, supporters who believe he was innocent have repeatedly heaped abuse on the victim - with some even breaking the law to name her online. Now it has emerged two photos of the woman were posted on an Asian news website, according to an investigation by Simon Wright for the Sunday People. The newspaper claimed it was not necessary to have the woman's name to find the images, and the web page hosting them was viewed thousands of times. Rape victims are entitled to lifelong anonymity, which is lifted only if they choose to waive it themselves or are prosecuted for perjury or perverting the course of justice. Those who break the law by circulating a rape victim's name can be fined up to £5,000 each, whether or not they claimed to know it was illegal. Jill Saward, a campaigner who waived her right to anonymity after being brutally gang-raped in 1986, told the newspaper the pictures' emergence was 'scandalous'. 'This callous irresponsibility is being fuelled by people who did not like the outcome of the case', she said. 'She has already undergone a traumatic experience but her nightmare shows no sign of ending'. Scroll down for video . Evans, who had a  girlfriend of two years, had been on a Sunday night out in his home town of Rhyl when the rape took place in 2012. The victim, then just a teenager, had been on a night out which involved drinking at least two large glasses of red wine, four double vodkas and a shot of Sambuca. Maintaining his innocence: Evans, pictured with fiancée Natasha Massey, is still challenging the case. Vile trolls have heaped abuse on his victim from the 2012 rape, breaking the law to name her . CCTV from a nearby fast food shop showed her staggering and losing her balance, falling into a wall, before she ended up being taken back to Evans' hotel room. Nine trolls of the victim were fined £624 each in 2012 for naming his victim online - causing her to leave her home town and adopt a new identity. The former footballer has always insisted he is innocent and is backed by a well-funded campaign to clear his name. He  plans to challenge his conviction with the Criminal Cases Review Commission. That  led vengeful supporters to brand his distraught victim a 'dirty little money-grabber', and a 'dirty slut who brought the situation on herself' and 'deserved much worse'. The comments prompted outrage by anti-rape campaigners who said the victim was being blamed for something that was not in any way her fault. All smiles: Now released from jail, Evans is resuming his life - but his victim from 2012 is still in hiding . This week the Ched Evans case was once again making headlines over guidelines which would see men accused of date rape being asked to prove that a woman wanted to have sex. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said it was vital to remove ‘any grey area’ to recognise situations where a woman may have been unable to give consent. Campaigners described the move as a ‘huge step forward’ in ensuring fewer rapists escaped justice, though critics said it could threaten the presumption of innocence. Evans, meanwhile, has said he is determined to return to football. Outrage over his potential to set a bad example to children has stopped that from happening so far, with potential signings to Oldham and Sheffield being thwarted.","Investigation claims two photos surfaced on Asian news website .

"A fire that ripped through one of Russia's largest public libraries has been likened to a cultural 'Chernobyl'. The blaze began late on Friday at the Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences in Moscow, which was created in 1918 and holds more than 14 million items. It also contains documents from the League of Nations, UNESCO, and early parliamentary reports dating back as far as 1789. Scroll down for video . A fire ripped through the Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences in Moscow late on Friday . The library in Moscow contains one of the world's richest collections of Slavic language works in Russia . The fire continued to burn throughout Saturday despite 200 firefighters' efforts to douse the blaze . Vladimir Fortov, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said: 'It's a major loss for science. This is the largest collection of its kind in the world, probably equivalent to the [US] Library of Congress. 'One can find documents there that are impossible to find elsewhere, all the social sciences use this library. What has happened here is reminiscent of Chernobyl,' he said, referring to the 1986 nuclear catastrophe. He said about 15 per cent of the collection had been damaged at the library, which includes one of the world's richest collections of Slavic language works, as well as documents from Britain, Italy and the US. He added that much of the damage was caused by water from the firefighting operations. The institute's director Yuri Pivovarov said firefighters had done 'everything possible' to save the texts. No one was injured in the fire, which broke out on Friday evening on the library's second floor and continued burning throughout Saturday despite 200 firefighters' efforts to douse the blaze. The cause of the blaze is unclear, but according to Russia media investigations suspect an electrical short-circuit was to blame.","Fire was at Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences, Moscow .

"Presenter Cathy Newman says she was ushered out of the door of a mosque in Streatham, in south London . A Channel 4  news presenter said she was ejected from a London mosque yesterday despite being 'respectfully dressed' when she tried to make an open day visit. Cathy Newman turned up for the British Muslim Council's Visit My Mosque day, but was stunned to be ushered back into the street. A number of mosques around the country participated in the open day event yesterday. In the wake of the terror attacks by Islamic gunmen in Paris last month, it was held to provide an insight into the running of centres of worship and to allow people to ask questions about Islam. Miss Newman later reported receiving a 'warm welcome' from another mosque nearby in Streatham, South London. The journalist detailed the incident on Twitter, writing: 'Well I just visited Streatham mosque for #VisitMyMosque day and was surprised to find myself ushered out of the door. 'I was respectfully dressed, head covering and no shoes but a man ushered me back onto the street. I said I was there for #VisitMyMosque but it made no difference.' Miss Newman was later given tea and cake at the Hyderi Islamic Centre. Esmat Jeraj, a managing trustee at the centre, claimed the problem was caused by Miss Newman turning up at a mosque which wasn't taking part in the open day event. She told MailOnline: 'She was always supposed to come to our centre. She had been sent to the wrong mosque. 'When she arrived they weren't expecting any guests. It wasn't because she was a woman, but because they weren't operating any open door policy that day. They weren't expecting any visitors or holding any services either, I think. Scroll down for video . Cathy Newman, pictured fourth from right, at Hyderi Islamic Centre in Streatham, south London, today . 'Once she arrived at our centre we gave her a cup of tea and had a chat. We apologised for the incident and clarified that she not should base that as an example of Islam.' A spokesman for the South London Islamic Centre apologised for the incident and vowed to review their procedures. Visit My Mosque Day, organised by The Muslim Council of Britain, is a nationwide event, where a number of mosques across the country are opening their doors to the general public. Participating mosques aimed to provide an insight into the day-to-day running of a busy centre of worship and answer questions about Islam. On a Muslim Council of Britain website, it said: 'Members of the community are there to get to know one another better and some may be on hand to answer questions about Muslims and Islam where this is possible. She tweeted that she was 'respectfully dressed' but still ushered out onto the street by a man at the mosque . 'Local mosques will also be inviting inter-faith leaders as well, and all will be invited to come together to demonstrate unity and solidarity during what has been a tense time for faith communities.' Ms Jeraj added: 'In our centre, we had both men and women actively participating. 'The event was a really positive action that allowed members of our community and people from all over to interact with British Muslims and develop stronger community ties.' Ms Newman's comments quickly sparked debate on Twitter. Former MP Louise Mensch said: 'Giant misogynistic fail of #VisitMyMosque, @MuslimCouncil, shutting @cathynewman out. Statement?' A spokesman for the South London Islamic Centre told MailOnline: 'We were sorry to hear that Channel 4's Cathy Newman was allegedly 'ushered out' of our mosque and Islamic centre. 'That is certainly not our policy, and we have a track record of welcoming people to our mosque, and we are members of Interfaith. 'We do not know who did this, and we will review our procedures. Our mosque has always had both men and women worshippers.' He added: 'The South London Islamic Centre has held in the past, and will continue to hold open days. 'As a small mosque it is voluntarily manned over the weekend. Normally we would have taken part in the Muslim Council of Britain's 'Visit My Mosque’ day but on this occasion no one was available to man the event, even though we would dearly have loved to. 'With longer notice, we hope to take part in the future. In the meantime, we would extend an open invitation to Ms Newman, and anyone else. We are a small institution, but nevertheless one that welcomes our guests.'

"'Took two stun gun shots': Zane Thomas Gavin, 23, reportedly tried to carjack a deputy at 4:30am . A topless 23-year-old man reportedly tried to carjack a sheriff's deputy, soaked up two shots from a Taser and then brawls with back-up officers in a bizarre early-morning encounter. Zane Thomas Gavin was arrested after a significant struggle at 4:30am early Saturday morning in Palm Harbor, Florida, in which he allegedly attacked several deputies and tried to steal a patrol car. Gavin was spotted by deputy Richard Tipton running suddenly across a highway in the town, then seemingly getting knocked down by a passing SUV. But when Tipton went to check on him, Gavin allegedly stood up and aimed a brutal punch at the officer's head, flooring the man and breaking his glasses. Deputies said Gavin continued to beat Tipton, then got into his cruiser and started revving the engine as if to drive away, local station Bay News 9 reported. The deputy was able to call for back-up, and tried to use his stun gun on Gavin , but the electric shock failed to bring him down. The driver of the SUV, Sharon Scroggins, 59, tried to intervene and was also injured. Describing the first moments of the encounter, she told Bay News: 'We just turned not too far down the road and this big huge guy with no shirt on, literally just his hands up and like he was diving, he went right in front of my car.' An incident report said that Tipton's second shot with the weapon also had no immediate effect, but that Gavin got out of the car and then collapsed in the middle of the road again. By this point, the report said, backup deputies had arrived and approached Gaving - who reportedly brawled with them as well. 'Brawled with the back-up': Gavin, who ran across this road in front on an SUV in Palm Harbor, Florida, allegedly fought more officers before being subdued . They were eventually able to arrest him. Gavin has now been charged with two counts of aggravated battery, violently resisting arrest, attempted carjacking. Deputies said Tipon was left with a broken tailbone and damaged to his face and lip. Scroggins was taken to hospital with head injury, which was described as not being life-threatening. Gavin was taken to hospital then booked into jail, as officers continue to investigate.","Zane Thomas Gavin, 23, allegedly fought deputy in Palm Harbor, Florida .

"An east-London man fighting for ISIS in Syria is thought be working side-by-side with the British man seen beheading hostages in a number of videos, known as Jihadi John. Nero Saraiva, 28, is thought have risen in the ranks to become one of ISIS's most senior fighters and has been posting images of firearms similar to those used by Jihadi John on social media. Saraiva is one of five young men from east London who all moved from their native Portugal to London, where they converted to Islam before adopting extremist views and travelling to Syria to join the terrorist network's ranks. ISIS militant: Nero Saraiva, a 28-year-old Portuguese national from east London, has been posting several images of weapons similar to those carried by British ISIS fighter Jihadi John . The men, who lived in Leyton and Walthamstow, have long been on the radar of intelligence officials - who believe the group plays a vital role in the production and dissemination of the sick beheading videos featuring Jihadi John. Saravia, a father-of-four has posted several images of weapons on his Twitter, including a Glock 19 pistol with an extended magazine, similar to that carried by Jihadi John, the Sunday Times reports. Ringleader Saraiva, a former engineering student was the first of the group to travel to Syria in the summer of 2012. He has a five-year-old son in the UK, who he has never supported financially, and is thought to have lived in Britain the longest, having appeared on the electoral roll in 2003. Last year his name was linked to an alleged terrorist plot in east Africa involving al-Qaeda affiliate group al-Shabaab. He is a known supporter of hate-preaching cleric, Abu Hamza, recently jailed for life in America for terrorism offences. Ringleader: Saraiva was the first of the group to travel to Syria in the summer of 2012 and is thought to have lived in the UK for the longest . A tweet posted 39 days before the murder of James Foley suggested Saraiva had advance knowledge of the American journalist's grisly fate . Links to killer: European security officials believe the East London cell are responsible for the filming and dissemination of the series of sickening beheading videos featuring British executioner Jihadi John, seen here in a video released last night allegedly showing the beheading of Japanese hostage Kenji Goto . In July 2014 - 39 days before James Foley became the first Western hostage to be murdered - he posted a message on Twitter indicating he had advance knowledge of the American journalist's grisly fate. Saraiva, who lived in a one-bedroom council flat in Walthamstow for three years, tweeted: 'Message to America, the Islamic State is making a new movie. Thank u for the actors.' Just over a month later James Foley was beheaded in a YouTube video entitled A Message To America. European security officials believe Saraiva and his East London cell are responsible for the filming and dissemination of the series of sickening beheading videos, including the execution of British hostages Alan Henning and David Haines. MI5 are said to have worked out the identity of Jihadi John but have not yet released his name. All five of the football-playing jihadists showed a passion for football in their younger years, and after moving to the UK, would often meet in a Portuguese-run cafe in east London to watch matches. It is still unclear how they were radicalised in Britain but the borough of Waltham Forest where they lived is known to be home to a number of Islamic extremists. Talented footballer turned jihadist: The youngest of the east London terror cell, Fabio Pocas, 22, played at the same Portuguese academy as Cristiano Ronaldo, before joining an amateur side in London . Promising: Pocas (circled), pictured with amateur side UK Football Finder, had received attention from an agent who told him he could expect a trial at a professional club . Also among the five, who all moved to London over the space of several years to study or find work, is Fabio Pocas, the youngest member of the group at 22. Pocas moved from Lisbon to London in 2012 in his bid to become a professional footballer. He had previously played at the youth academy of Sporting Lisbon - a club which has bred a host of world stars including Luis Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo. After arriving in London, Pocas began playing for an amateur league team called UK Football Finder Football Club (UKFFFC), where he flourished. After helping the side become champions of their division, he was offered the prospect of a trial with a professional club. The team's coach, Ewemade Orobator, told The Sunday Times: 'He came here to play football seriously. 'In about May 2013 an agent came down and said ""Work hard over the summer and I will get you a trial [with a professional club]"".' But Pocas, who had recently converted to Islam, failed to capitalise on the offer and simply 'disappeared' - before later resurfacing in Syria in ISIS propaganda photos. The talented footballer has since been prolific on social media, posing in online pictures with ISIS flags and guns. He now goes by the name Abdurahman Al Andalus and lives in a town called Manjib with his Dutch teenage jihadi bride. One of the brothers: Celso Rodrigues da Costa followed his older sibling Edgar to Syria to join ISIS. Where they were radicalised: The five keen footballers turned jihadists had all been living in Walthamstow and Leyton in east London after moving to the UK from Portugal . In a recent Facebook message, he wrote: 'Holy war is the only solution for humanity.' All five of the men had family roots in Portugal's former African colonies and some were brought up to be Christians. They travelled to London separately but at one point, a few of them shared a flat in Leyton, according to Expresso newspaper in Lisbon. Celso Rodrigues da Costa, 28, is believed to have had training sessions with Arsenal - but was not offered a contract by the club. However an Arsenal spokesperson said: “We don't have any record of a Mr Celso Rodrigues Da Costa being involved with the club at any level.” Last April, he was seen in an ISIS video shot on the banks of the Euphrates in Syria with an AK-47 in hand. In the clip, he slammed the West and denounced school teachers as 'drug dealers and paedophiles'. Celso is thought to have followed his older brother, Edgar, to Syria in 2012. His 31-year-old sibling, who studied management and accounting in Portugal before emigrating to London, is thought to leading a band of foreign militants in Aleppo. Both men were enrolled at the University of East London (UEL) in Stratford, but were thrown off their courses after failing to attend lectures. The fifth member of the cell, a 26-year-old former Catholic known as Sandro, was the last to travel to Syria and was reportedly killed last October in a coalition airstrike.","Nero Saraiva is one of five east London footballers fighting in Syria .

"While this  Asian black bear in southwest Russia won't have seen Disney's The Jungle Book or read Rudyard Kipling's source material, it shows it has the dancing skills to match the story's star Baloo. The breed dubbed the ursine species' 'most bizarre' by Kipling appears to throw shapes  with an unsuspecting birch tree as its partner in footage taken with hidden cameras in a wildlife reserve. In reality, it's more likely the majestic creature with the distinctive white marking on its chest is marking its territory and simply having a good old scratch of its hard to reach places, but the resemblance to Mowgli's mate is uncanny. And while it's believed Baloo's character is based more on the sloth bear found in India, the preacher of the Law of the Jungle's diet of 'only roots and nuts and honey' is more consistent with this very Asian black bear. An Asian black bear appears to be doing its best Saturday Night Fever at Land of the Leopard in Russia . The footage released on Friday was shot back in November with a camera placed for research purposes at Land of the Leopard national park in Vladivostok. This black bear, a species also known as moon bears due to the crescent shape of its making or the more obvious white-chested bear, rubs its back up and down the birch without a care. Despite this adorable footage, the breed is said to be rather dangerous to humans and despite being herbivorous is prone to unprovoked attacks. Male black bears survey large territories that are said to be up to 80 square miles and are renowned for protecting their turf voraciously. The bear drops to the ground in a move reminiscent of a night club dancefloor at the Vladivostok reserve . Baloo from Disney classic The Jungle Book also loves to dance and have a scratch against a tree . This one appears quite relaxed though in a video that has made it an internet sensation. It was caught on cameras placed by scientists at the Land of the Leopard park in the Primorsky Krai region. Research for the scientists centres mostly on the local Amur leopard population which, with as few as 45 adults left in the wild, is a contender to be the rarest of the big cats. Black bears were decribed by The Jungle Book creator Rudyard Kipling as the 'most bizarre' ursine species . This bear was caught on a hidden camera placed by scientists at a reserve established to protect rare Amur leopards and Amur tigers . The Asian black bear can be found in the Himalayas, Korea, the north of India, China, Japan, Taiwan and, as in this case, the far east of Russia. The species is classified as 'Vulnerable' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to hunting for its body parts and the impact of deforestation taking away its natural habitat. However, the Russian government has done them a favour in declaring the 1,000 square mile Land of the Leopard a protected reserve in 2012 in a bid to protect both the Amur leopards and Amur tigers.","Asian black bear appears to dance with a tree in Russian national park .

"Pumped-up Education Secretary Nicky Morgan this morning angrily rejected claims Michael Gove was still meddling in schools policy – insisting: 'I'm in charge.' Mrs Morgan dismissed as 'complete nonsense' revelations that her predecessor is receiving confidential documents from her department despite being sacked six months ago. The Cabinet minister, a former high-powered lawyer, added she had previously seen off men trying to tell her what to do – by rejecting her vicar's attempt  to get her to 'obey' her husband when she got married. Mrs Morgan said the vicar had 'lost that battle', adding: 'I didn't use those words.' The Education Secretary, speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, also suggested she had won a behind-the-scenes battle with the military against further cuts to the schools budget. Scroll down for video . Education Secretary Nicky Morgan this morning angrily rejected claims Michael Gove was still meddling in schools policy – insisting: 'I'm in charge' Ms Morgan said she was 'absolutely fighting for the schools budget to be protected'. But the Tory minister made clear that the ringfence would apply to education for five to 16-year-olds but did not commit to similar protections for early years or further education. Her comments came as Prime Minister David Cameron was applying the finishing touches to a speech that is expected to further outline the Tories' education plans tomorrow. Part of the plan will be for all pupils to pass tough new exams before leaving primary school as part of a 'war on illiteracy and innumeracy'. As well as demonstrating mathematical skills, pupils will have to pass a writing test by showing they can use 'accurate punctuation, spelling and grammar'. By the time they leave primary school all 11 year-olds will know their times tables, be able to read a novel, and be able to write a short story under the plans. Despite announcing the new policy today, Mrs Morgan was forced to fend off claims that her predecessor as Education Secretary was acting as a backseat driver from his position as Chief Whip. Ms Morgan said: 'I think this is a complete load of nonsense. Michael has been nothing but supportive as have other former education secretaries. 'I am very much in charge of the Department for Education and we are all as Conservative colleagues united in what we want to see.' The Education Secretary, speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, also suggested she had won a behind-the-scenes battle with the military against further cuts to the schools budget . The Royal Marines could be merged with the army’s elite airborne brigade and taken out of the Navy, under plans being considered to cope with a new round of military cuts. Government officials are looking at a proposal to create a joint airborne and amphibious force, which would see the marines put under the control of the army, according to the Sunday Times. The radical proposal is being drawn up as senior military figures brace themselves for further swingeing defence cuts, amid signs the Department for Education has won the battle for funding with the Ministry of Defence. David Cameron and Ed Miliband have refused to ring-fence defence spending – with experts warning this could mean further cuts to the defence budget of up to 26 per cent after 2015/16. Mrs Morgan said more needed to be done to promote 'British values' in schools. She said headteachers needed to promote 'democracy, rule of law, individual liberty, and… respect for people of other faiths and other beliefs'. But she admitted that values changed as time went on, adding: 'I remember having a debate with the vicar before I got married about whether I was going to obey my husband. 'My husband said 'have a go, I think you're going to lose that battle' – and he did, and I didn't use those words. 'That's why things do change and I think those are the core values and I think it is important that all our schools are promoting them. As I say, the best schools are doing this already.' But Mrs Morgan said it was an 'outrage' that under the last government 'one in three people were leaving primary school unable to read or write properly'. She said the new reading and writing targets for primary school were 'what parents and families would expect as a minimum from our exam system'. Mrs Morgan added: 'As I say, we have to be ambitious for our young people: If we don't get it right in primary it becomes much harder for children to catch up when they're in secondary schools.' Headteachers who fail to ensure the standards are met face being sacked if the Conservatives are returned to power, she indicated. 'We have to be ambitious for our young people, if we don't get it right at primary then it becomes much harder for children to catch up when they are in secondary schools,' she said. Ms Morgan hopes the tests will help England to the top of the class in European league tables for English and maths by 2020, as well as in the top five internationally - a significant leap from the current ranking of 23rd. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt claimed the Government's schools policy was allowing more unqualified teachers into classrooms which was damaging England's international position in education. The Labour frontbencher said: 'David Cameron's flawed schools policy is damaging our education system and failing to close the learning gap between disadvantaged children and the rest. 'Many parents will be shocked to learn that David Cameron's government has changed the rules to allow unqualified teachers into the classroom on a permanent basis, leading to a 16% rise in the last year alone.' Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt claimed the Government's schools policy was allowing more unqualified teachers into classrooms . He added: 'The surest way to raise standards in every lesson, in every school, is to improve the quality of teaching in the classroom. 'That begins with an end to Cameron's unqualified teachers policy. Labour will ensure that all teachers are qualified and continue to train to improve their teaching as a condition to remaining in the classroom. 'This is how we improve the learning and life chances for all children and raise our international position in reading, writing and maths.' A spokesman for Michael Gove said the claim, reported in the Independent on Sunday, that he was meddling in education policy was untrue. The spokesman said: 'This is total nonsense, as usual. I'm surprised a paper which employs the brilliant John Rentoul would print rubbish like this.' A Cabinet Office spokesman added: 'The Independent on Sunday's story is totally untrue. The Chief Whip's office has not received, handled or put into the red box any of the Education Secretary's paperwork.'","Nicky Morgan rejects claims Michael Gove still meddling in schools policy .

"Andrew Sadek's body turned up last June along the banks of the Red River, which winds between Minnesota and North Dakota, with a gunshot wound to the head. The 20-year-old college student had been cooperating with narcotics task force SEMCA, as a confidential informant, but had severed contact with agents shortly before his death. With the gun that killed her son still missing, Sadek's mother believes that force knows more than it is sharing about the events surrounding his death. More questions: Andrew Sadek, 20, turned up dead months after walking away from a role as confidential informant for a narcotics task force, who his mother, Tammy, believes pressured him . 'There are more students in danger,' Tammy Sadek told KVLY after a report was released this week. 'SEMCA is alive and well, doing what they please.' She had petitioned the North Dakota Attorney General for an independent review of SEMCA, which she has accused of bullying her son into the risky position of being a confidential informant. According to the five-page report, in April 2013 Sadek sold two small quantities of marijuana that together totaled $80 to a SEMCA informant on the North Dakota State College of Science campus, where Sadek attended classes. In November of that year, SEMCA agents searched Sadek's dorm room and found a plastic grinder with marijuana residue that Sadek confessed belonged to him. During an interview at a police station in Wahpeton, the report states, Sadek was told about the charges he was facing and agreed to become a confidential informant in order that the charges be dropped or eliminated. Between November 2013 and January 2014, he bought marijuana on three separate occasions under the direction of a SEMCA agent. After the third buy, Sadek stopped communicating with SEMCA agents, who tried to push him to make more narcotics purchases, the report says. Early in May, Sadek was reported missing. In June his body was fished out of the Red River near Breckenridge, Minnesota. The review, ordered by SEMCA's Executive Board and conducted by the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation, outlined four minor recommendations. This included requiring briefings before informants carried out controlled buys and requested an official supervisor be appointed to the task force. It also recommended assigning a North Dakota BCI agent to SEMCA. Unsolved: Though investigators have not found the weapon or made arrests in Sadek's death, his mother Tammy believes he would not have killed himself . Good student: His mother said that there are more students like her son that are being put at risk by SEMCA . The review found no wrongdoing in the task force's conduct and did not give details about the investigation into Sadek's death. The student was last seen leaving Nordgaard Hall at 2 a.m. on May 2 wearing a red and black sweatshirt. When he turned up dead in June, he was in a jacket that his mother didn't recognize. His wallet has yet to be recovered,Twin Cities reports. The weapon that killed him has also not been found, and though the family says it's missing a .22-caliber pistol, his mother believes his circumstances point to suicide. 'There was no suicidal tendencies,' she said back in October. 'There was no note. There was no depression. And his grades were excellent.' On campus: Colleges have faced scrutiny for allowing police to use students as confidential informants, while Sadek's mother has questioned whether officers pressured her son . 'Somebody knows something. They need to have the strength and courage to come forward and speak up.' The use of confidential informants to conduct buys for law enforcement on college campuses has drawn scrutiny recently. Earlier this month, UMass-Amherst Chancellor announced the end of a controversial UMass police program that worked to turn students arrested for narcotics into informants. In 2013, Eric Sinacori, a 20-year-old UMass junior who had become an informant after being caught selling Molly and LSD to an undercover officer, overdosed on heroine in his off-campus apartment. In spite of finding a hypodermic needle during a search, officers did not arrest Sinacori or inform his parents, something that his mother, Francesca, believed had allowed his addiction to fester. 'If you find a needle on my kid, you have to assume it’s heroin. And if it’s heroin, you have to say something,' she told the Boston Globe.","Andrew Sadek, 20, was working for narcotics task force SEMCA after being caught dealing small amounts of marijuana, according to a report .

"An anti-pornography watchdog group has assailed the Motion Picture Association of America for giving an R rating to Fifty Shades of Grey, which is based on a series of erotic novels. Morality in America says the rating and accompanying reasoning given by the MPAA set a dangerous precedent by failing to properly acknowledge the film's sexual violence. The group wants the rating bumped to an NC-17 and tweaked to include references it says more accurately portray the film's more lurid content. Too permissive? Anti-pornography watchdog group Morality in Media attacked the Motion Picture Association of America for its decision last week to assign Fifty Shades of Grey an R rating instead of an NC-17 . The MPAA handed down the R rating for what it described as the film's 'strong sexual content including dialogue, some unusual behavior and graphic nudity' reports Variety. The term 'unusual behavior'--no doubt that of stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan--is what has Morality in America most outraged. 'What the term ""unusual"" does not account for is the coercion, sexual violence, female inequality, and BDSM themes from which the entire plot is based,' the group's statement, obtained by Entertainment Weekly, reads. 'Such a vague evaluation puts viewers at risk, sending the message that humiliation is pleasurable and that torture should be sexually gratifying.' Morality in Media says the MPAA description of the film, which designates behavior in the film as simply 'unusual' sets a dangerous precedent for viewers whose takeaway might be that sexual violence and female inequality are positive things . Along with the harsher rating of NC-17, which would ban children from entry even with an adult, the group wants to change the MPAA description of Fifty Shades of Grey to read: . ‘Promotes torture as sexually gratifying, graphic nudity, encourages stalking and abuse of power, promotes female inequality, glamorizes and legitimizes violence against women.' The group's outrage, however, is surely only fueling anticipation for the February 13 release of the film based on the E.L. James novel of the same name. At the very least, star Jamie Dornan isn't convinced of his breakout film's unfitness for an R rating. He told GQ: . 'If people make such a hoo-hah about the violence against women aspect of it, it’s far more common for men to be the submissive. And it’s consensual! There’s weirder s*** than that.'","Pornography watchdog Morality in Media says the MPAA is encouraging sexual violence by letting the movie by without an NC-17 rating .
In describing the film, the MPAA refers to 'unusual behavior' - the morality group says that glosses over its harmful depiction of sexual deviance .
Morality in Media wishes to update the MPAA rating to read 'Promotes torture as sexually gratifying' among other changes ."
"Skier Raphael Beghi has a lifelong reminder of his spectacular crash while speeding down the slopes in the French Alps courtesy of a helmet-mounted camera. Beghi was on his first run of the day at the Serre Chevalier ski resort in Hautes-Alpes department of the Alps on January 25 after what he said was a big night of partying when he came a cropper. The competent skier cruised through the opening stages of the run before upping his speed and weaving in and out of his fellow holidaymakers on the piste, but then as the video shows he struck an unexpected bump. A day on the slopes started out well enough for skier Raphael Beghi in Serre Chevalier in the French Alps . Unfortunately, his night of partying soon caught up to him and he lost control in an attempt to cross the run . Raphael's skis pushed ahead of him and then off as he lost control while picking up speed on January 25 . Before he knew it both skis where gone and he was helpless as he was soon sliding down the piste . Beghi is left looking up at the pristine blue skies after the fall which saw him try and fail to cut across the run at the end of a safety barricade where a mound of snow had built up. In a split second his skis clipped off his boots and his momentum saw his slide a significant distance down the slope as snow flew up to obscure the otherwise picturesque view. When Raphael finally came to a stop, he lay quietly on the ground for a few moments before regaining his composure and switching off the camera. As he skids down the hill, a large amount of snow obscures the vision from his helmet-fixed camera . The skier remained calm as he slid down the slope on his back, without his skis before coming to a stop . Luckily he did not hit anything or suffer any severe injuries - he can be heard saying he's okay after the crash . Beghi lay calmly on his back after coming to a stop and later wrote he would not recommend skiing downhill on a Sunday morning after a drunken night out the evening before . In fact, Beghi, who is heard to confirm he's OK, almost appeared relieved to be having a rest in the snow based on later comments online. 'First downhill race on Sunday morning after a drunken night,' he wrote. 'A good lesson for those who do not control their speed as I did. No severe injuries but a huge thrill!'","Skier Raphael Beghi captured fall via a helmet-mounted camera .

"The protester who gate-crashed the Australian Open men's final has apologised to Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and the 'tennis heads' at the game - but has said she would do it again to raise awareness about the plight of asylum seekers in Australia. 'I would absolutely do it again and again and again,' said Karoline Morwitzer, 32, on Radio 3AW this morning. The community arts worker told Daily Mail Australia about the 'scary' and 'overwhelming' moment she and a friend were grabbed by security after they stormed the court. Play was halted for five minutes while the activists were carried away from the court, with many in the crowd booing. Around six other people in the front row joined the demonstration, wearing shirts: 'Australia Open for refugees' or 'Shut Down Manus Island'. Scroll down for video . Security guards quickly detained two women, including Karoline Morwitzer (pictured), who ran onto the court during the second set of Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic's Australian Open Men's Final match . Channel 7 opted to delay the telecast for four minutes so the commotion caused by the protest and the slogan on the banner were not shown on television . Arts worker: Ms Morwitzer has pledged to act in defence of asylum seekers 'again and again and again' When she's not protesting, Ms Morwitzer is a community arts worker who has been involved in bands (pictured) A security guard runs after one of the women who managed to get access to centre court at Rod Laver Arena whilst fellow refugee advocates brandish a banner from the front row . Two women rushed onto the court yelling and waving banners which declared: ‘Australia Open for refugees #ShutdownManus', whilst another banner was also unfurled by another five supporters in the front row . 'This issue was bigger than the tennis, bigger than Rod Laver Arena and something we felt every person in Australia better be thinking critically and consciously about,' she said. 'I would say to the players -  as well to all the tennis heads - I send an apology to them but reiterate that this issue is bigger than the tennis game.' But Ms Morwitzer refused to go into detail about how expensive their protest was and how much planning was involved. 'I'm going to continue to skirt that particular aspect because it may affect the charges,' Ms Morwitzer said. The Tennis Australia price guide said tickets purchased prior to the tournament commencing cost $390 for adults. 'It's something every person in Australia needs to be thinking very very deeply - legitimising torture and abuse.' The Manus Island immigration detention facility, also known as the Manus Island Regional processing centre, is an offshore asylum processing institution located in Papua New Guinea, which operates on behalf of the Australian Government. Recently, the centre has been the subject of a number of protests which are angered by harsh treatment of detainees, who have been denied basic amenities as they bid for asylum. The policy of detaining asylum seekers offshore - intended as an immigration deterrent - has been criticised by several human rights groups. Following the court invasion, Australian Open officials released a statement on Twitter, confirming the arrests of two protesters. Tug of war: A security guard removes the banner of political protesters during the men's singles final between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic . Seated: Security guards circled Djokovic (left) and Murray (right) to protect them, as a precaution despite the peaceful nature of the protest. The match was stalled for five minutes due to the protest . The Australian Open Twitter account announced that both women were arrested for intruding on the court . 'Two people have been arrested after a court invasion during the second set of the men's final,' they wrote. 'Security responded immediately. Both were quickly removed with minimal disruption to play.' Apparently unperturbed by the incident, Djokovic went on to beat Murray to claim his fifth Australian Open title. A team of around four security guards each formed a shield around the tennis players when the intruders broke out onto the court. The Australian Open Men’s Final was televised live and was expected to draw in millions of viewers. Channel 7 opted to delay the telecast for four minutes so the commotion caused by the protest and the slogan on the banner were not shown on television. However, photos of the incident quickly circulated online, particularly on social media. The group who organised the protest are  called Australia Open for Refugees. 'We have created this international media spectacle today to expose the torture, abuse, and horrific conditions that are being perpetrated on Manus Island,"" the group told SBS. ""We will not be silent. We are drawing a line with this issue. If we allow this to happen, there is no end to what this government is capable of."" Debate ensued when many took to social media, sharing a range of opinions on the unexpected protest. ‘Yeah, that ""Australia open for refugees"" sign did look threatening. Cant have human rights interrupt our entertainment,’ tweeted Steve Raymond. ‘Great protest at the Australian Open, from what I hear. Well done, whoever it was. MY country will ALWAYS be open for asylum seekers,’ wrote Sir Joseph d'Ananas . ‘Why pay $400 bucks for a ticket and then decide to jump on court and protest. #Cowards #Gutless,’ wrote Michael Thompson. ‘Would like to applauded the @AustralianOpen security team. They had the protest dealt with at a blink of an eye,’ wrote Anita. ‘Congrats to the #refugee rights protesters for trying to get national attention,’tweeted Nicola Paris.

"There is growing concern that the United States could become gripped by a measles epidemic, according to the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said his agency is 'very concerned' about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in the U.S. His fears come as a growing number of people who have not been vaccinated against the disease are being exposed to the rest of the population. Scroll down for video . Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC said his agency is 'very concerned' about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in the U.S. Frieden said in an interview on CBS' 'Face the Nation' Sunday: 'What we've seen is, as over the last few years, a small but growing number of people have not been vaccinated. 'That number is building up among young adults in society, and that makes us vulnerable. 'We have to make sure that measles doesn't get a foothold in the U.S. It's been actually eliminated from this country for 15 years. 'All of our cases result, ultimately, from individuals who have traveled and brought it back here.' At last count, there were 102 reported cases of measles in 14 states across the country. However, this looks set to grow. The CDC has now launched an aggressive campaign to combat the spread of the disease which can be highly contagious. The organization aims to identify and isolate people who may have the disease in order to stop it spreading further. Frieden advised that the best way to halt the spread of the disease is by getting vaccinated and said that the vaccine is both safe and effective. At least 92 percent of the population is vaccinated. However, the number of children who are not vaccinated, is higher in some states, particularly in California where the most recent outbreak of the disease was linked to Disney theme parks. Yet, this outbreak, according to NBC probably came from overseas, carried either by a foreign tourist or by an American coming back with the virus. To date, the virus from Disneyland has infected 94 people in eight states, and 67 can be clearly linked to the theme park,  health officials report. 'We don't know exactly how this outbreak started but we do think it was likely a person infected with measles overseas,' Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Vaccination: A child gets a vaccinated, but in southern California, eight percent of kindergarteners fail to get the required immunizations against measles, mumps and rubella . Outbreak: The outbreak of measles that started in California's Disneyland has infected 94 people in eight states, and 67 can be clearly linked to Disneyland, California health officials report . 'We assume that someone got infected with measles overseas, visited Disneyland park, and spread the disease to others.' According to CBS News, in southern California, eight percent of kindergarteners fail to get the required immunizations against measles, mumps and rubella. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, it's 15 percent of kindergarteners, because many parents simply do not want to 'risk' getting their child vaccinated. Frieden told the TV show that some parents who opt out of vaccinations cited a 'personal belief,' but it never appeared to be for a particularly strong reason. He also warned that parents are putting their child at risk if they do not vaccinate them, and this also puts others at risk too. The CDC is keen to avoid a devastating outbreak similar to the one which took hold in 1989 and 1991, when 55,000 people got measles and 123 died. Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but a few imported cases come in every year. But the CDC director does not want to see widespread mandatory vaccinations rolled out, like in   Mississippi and West Virginia, which have nearly 100 percent vaccination rates.","Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC said his agency is 'very concerned'

"A Canadian woman is suing a police force for $400,000 after an officer handcuffed her and put her in the back of a police vehicle with an unhandcuffed sex offender who raped her. The unnamed victim was 17 at the time of the September 2011 assault, according to The Independent, and said in the lawsuit that the incident left her with post-traumatic stress disorder. The woman, now 21, was held by Danielle Gallant, a former constable of the Kativik Regional Police Force, on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly, the New York Daily News reports. Village: A woman was raped while i police custody by a registered sex offender in the small Quebec village of Tasiujaq (photographed) The rookie officer, who had been with the force for less than a month, handcuffed the woman, placed her in the back of a van with 24-year-old Joe Kitrik, and left. Kritik, who was picked up earlier that night, was listed on Canada's sex offender registry and had already been convicted of four sexual assaults, CBC reports. He was not handcuffed. The lawsuit states that when Gallant returned to the vehicle Kritik had his 'pants down while on top of the plaintiff,' according to the Independent. 'The plaintiff was unable to defend herself, being handcuffed in her back and unable to leave the vehicle, the doors being locked,' the lawsuit claims. Gallant pulled Kritik off of the woman and took the two to the police station in Tasiujaq, a village in Quebec. The Independent reports that the woman was kept in a holding cell overnight, and was not given medical attention. Her parents were not contacted. Kritik pleaded guilty to the sexual assault and was sentenced to 39 months in prison, CBC reports, Gallant was suspended and later resigned. An investigation by the force cleared Gallant of any wrongdoing. Not handcuffed: Joe Kritik, who was  not handcuffed,  was listed on Canada's sex offender registry and had already been convicted of four sexual assaults . The lawsuit against Gallant, the  Force and the Kativik Regional Government seeking $400,000 (509,180 CAD) in damages states that the force exhibited a 'serious lack of professionalism.' It claims the force exhibited gross negligence 'by leaving an inexperienced police officer, with no knowledge or life experience of northern Quebec populations, and without the authorization to carry a firearm, to ensure alone the security of the public.' That was more than three years ago, but the suit claims that the incident has taken a toll on the woman, the Independent reports. A psychologist's report states that the woman suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and has nightmares about the assault. She is afraid of men and will not leave her home by herself.","A Canadian woman is suing a local police station for $400,000 after an officer handcuffed her and put her in the back of a police vehicle with an unhandcuffed sex offender who raped her .

"Comedian Tracy Morgan made a rare appearance in public on Saturday as he made his way with the help of a cane to a New York City hospital. Nearly eight months after his devastating car crash on the New Jersey Turnpike, the 46-year-old still appeared labored as he walked with fiancée Megan Wollover and their daughter Maven. While the crash--which killed Morgan's comedian friend James McNair--has clearly left the 30 Rock star with lingering injuries, the cane he used Saturday was a step in the right direction. In December, a decidedly more pained-looking Morgan was pictured using  a walker. Road to recovery: Actor and comedian Tracy Morgan appeared in New York on Saturday walking with the help of a cane as he battles to recover from a devastating June highway crash that killed his friend Jame McNair . Morgan was alongside his fiancee Megan Wollover as he made his way to a New York hospital . Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury in the June 7 accident, according to his lawyer, in which a Wal-Mart truck slammed into a limo van carrying Morgan and others home from a show in Delaware. Criminal charges against truck driver Kevin Roper are pending in state court in New Jersey. McNair, 62, of Peekskill, grew up with Morgan in Brooklyn and was a friend and mentor to him over the years. The family of McNair settled out of court a wrongful death suit filed against Wal-Mart. The terms of the settlement are confidential, but McNair family attorney Daryl Zaslow told The Associated Press the family was pleased with the outcome. May never be the same: The 30 Rock star's attorney Benedict Morelli, said in December that Morgan hadn't fully recovered from his brain injury and that it was uncertain if he would be 'the Tracy Morgan he once was' Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury in the June 7 accident, according to his lawyer, in which a Wal-Mart truck slammed into a limo van carrying Morgan and others home from a show in Delaware . Wal-Mart 'caused extensive damage' to the family but accepted responsibility and 'more than stepped up to the plate and took care of this family,' Zaslow said. 'Ultimately they did the right thing by the McNairs,' he said. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, was working toward settlements with others injured in the accident. 'We know there is nothing we can do to change what happened to Mr. McNair,' Buchanan said. 'We're committed to doing what's right.'

'She was not a monster. She snapped, and we don't really know why,' Kathy O'Neill, Mrs Terry's aunt, said, adding that her niece had been drinking and using medication, likely to deal with her pain. 'It was Tiffany... but the actions were not the Tiffany that we knew and loved. That's the only explanation we have, is she just got to a breaking point and something snapped,' Mrs O'Neill said. 'I'm numb, and I'm broken hearted. I just feel lost. We never dreamed that it would end up like this.' Happier times: 'She was not a monster. She snapped,' Mrs O'Neill, said, adding that her niece had been drinking and using medication, likely to deal with her pain. Above, Mrs Terry is pictured with her husband and children .

Lupus, which typically occurs when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues and organs. causes inflammation, while rheumatoid arthritis also inflames joints and surrounding tissues. Mrs Terry was also likely stressed by the upcoming anniversary of the death of her brother, who was killed in a car crash on February 1, 2008, her aunt said, adding: 'She's never really gotten over that.' Police were alerted to Mrs Terry's unusual behavior  on Tuesday afternoon after Connor called his father, George Terry, at work. The youngster told him:: 'Something is going on with mommy and... I'm scared.' Officers arrived at the family's home near 50th and Hickory streets shortly before 5pm. Seconds later, Mrs Terry burst from the door screaming expletives and wielding three knives, police said. She was gunned down after she hurled one of the weapons at Luna. Mrs O'Neill said her family is questioning why the officers fired at her, instead of 'try[ing] to subdue her in some other way'.

"One hundred and sixty families a day became property millionaires last year as house prices in the UK continued to soar. There are now 400,000 ‘homillionaires’ – owners of homes worth £1million or more – with houses worth a combined £836billion. And experts believe the rate of households becoming homillionaires will reach almost 200 a day this year. But many of these families remain cash-poor as their wealth is tied up in property. Scroll down for video . Park Lane in Altrincham in Cheshire, popular with Premier League footballers where average house prices are more than seven figures . Restrongeut Point in Truro, Cornwall has 55 houses worth more than £1million, according to Land Registry figures . Last year three times as many homes sold for seven-figure sums compared with ten years ago, according to research by estate agents Savills and the Sunday Times. There are more than 10,600 streets with an average house price of at least £1million. On 12 London streets it is impossible to buy even a garage for less than that amount. The most expensive, Kensington Palace Gardens, has an average house price of £42.7million. London has more homes over the £1million mark than the rest of the UK combined, but there are clusters of homillionaires in areas such as Cornwall, Cheshire, Edinburgh and Suffolk. Analysis of Land Registry and local authority data by the newspaper found seven-figure house sales had risen up to eight-fold in some areas since the 2007 market peak. Ilchester Place in Holland Park, west London, which which has showed the greatest increase in value of all residential properties sold in England and Wales over the past 20 years . Charlbury Road in Oxford, where one homeowner sold their property for £10million after buying it two years beforehand for £4.1million . In Cambridge, property sales worth at least £1million were up 200 per cent since before the recession. Hackney and Lewisham, formerly unfashionable London boroughs, saw the figure rise by 814 per cent and 275 per cent respectively. There are an estimated 275,000 homes worth £1million or more in London and 72,100 in the South East. Seven-figure sales in the East and the South West have jumped 35 per cent and 17 per cent respectively since 2006/07 – attributed to Londoners cashing in on their £1million-plus homes to buy mortgage-free in the countryside. Experts believe most homillionaires have a seven-figure property by accident, buying reasonably-priced houses one or two decades ago and seeing the value soar in the market boom. There are fears these homeowners would be unfairly targeted by Labour leader Ed Miliband’s proposed mansion tax – £250 a month for those with homes worth more than £2million. Labour peer Professor Robert Winston said the policy is like something from ‘Soviet Russia’ and unfair as it would not affect similar homes outside London. A Labour spokesman said it ‘would apply to fewer than 0.5 per cent of the UK’s homes’. In the North East, Runnymede Road in Newcastle saw a house sold for over £1million after being bought in 2000 for £300,000 .","Around 10,000 streets in UK have average property price of £1m or more .

"A stand-up comic has been pictured with comedy stars including Phill Jupitus and John Bishop is a convicted paedophile who filmed himself spanking a 15-year-old boy. Russell Haynes, 42, whose Instagram account shows him with a host of stars, spent two years behind bars for indecent assault and possession of hundreds of paedophile pictures. Then a gymnastics coach, Haynes had tied up his victim, a 15-year-old boy, and filmed the youngster performing a number of lewd sex acts, The Sun reports. Famous friends: Russ Haynes, right, 42, pictured with comedian Phill Jupitus. Haynes is a regular on the UK comedy scene who was in 2008 sentenced to two years in jail for paedophile offences . Rubbing shoulders: Haynes with John Bishop at a gig six months ago . Revealing his conviction to fans and friends today, the paedophile told his fans and friends that some 'positives' had come from his conviction. Haynes said: 'There are a lot of positives that has [sic] come out of this. 'I met my partner who has stood by me despite people trying to tear her down. I have two kids that are the most amazing thing in my life as well as her. I made some really great friends and I found my love of comedy which in many ways as help me be in such a happy place right now. I didn't have any of that at the time. 'I don't know what will happen next. I want to move on. I ... will try and use my experience for positivity and hopefully i can still do comedy. One of the things I want to do is a show about everything I went through.' He added: '12 years ago I made the worst choices of my life. Something I will always regret. I got myself into a situation that should never had happen I make no excuses. I hurt someone. I have to live with that.' There was a furious reaction from some fans, while a promoter suggested venues would not be willing to host his shows in future. Haynes with Jenny Eclair: Previously a gymnastics coach, Haynes had tied up his victim, a 15-year-old boy, and filmed the youngster performing a number of lewd sex acts . Grinning with Lee Nelson: Haynes targeted youngsters while running the Camberwell Gymnastics Club in south-east London, where he was director, coach and, ironically, child protection officer . Tom Fowler, from Actz Entertainment, wrote on Facebook: 'Russ i have booked you before supporting Lee Nelson, and have met you a few times and you come across as a very nice guy BUT this has changed everything. 'We as an agency work for some of the biggest entertainment bookers in the UK and there is no way they would book you into any of their venues or will we going forward. This may see seem shortsighted to some people but its FACTS and feel that other bookers will feel the same. It just makes you realise you don't really know anyone.' Nabil Obineche wrote: 'If you ever bump into me at a gig, don't try to greet me, do not even look at me. No doubt you'll gain some infamy from this but you knew that. You also knew you'd get all the abuse you'll no doubt get when you took up comedy too so man up and take it. YOU aren't the victim here.' While some fans defended Haynes for admitting he was convicted of being a paedophile, the day it was revealed in the Sun on Sunday, Paul Dunn wrote: 'Sickening. All of it; what happened & the arse kissing on here. Turning my stomach.' The father-of-two from South London, who remains on the Sex Offenders' Register, is a regular on the UK comedy circuit, rubbing shoulders with such luminaries as Sean Lock, Russell Kane, Lee Nelson and Jenny Eclair. MailOnline contacted representatives for Bishop, Jupitus, Eclair, Lock, Kane and Nelson for comment, but none were available on Sunday afternoon. Haynes was jailed in 2008 at Inner London Crown Court where he admitted indecent assault and making hundreds of indecent images and videos of children. He targeted youngsters while running the Camberwell Gymnastics Club in south-east London, where he was director, coach and, ironically, child protection officer. All smiles with Russell Kane: Haynes took up  stand-up comedy on his release from jail in 2009 . Selfies with the stars: Haynes with astrologer Russell Grant. He called his crime 'the biggest regret of my life' Haynes's trial revealed he had groomed his underage victim after setting up a chat forum for teenagers on which he posed as a girl called 'Jenny' to entice the boy to send him explicit pictures, the Sun reports. He then convinced the boy, a regular at the club from the age of seven, to share a room with him on club trips and encouraged him to strip and perform gymnastics naked or in women's underwear while Haynes took photographs. Police officers recovered 175 computer files containing more than 1,000 indecent images of children when they raided his home. One filmed clip showed Haynes spanking the boy. Haynes took up his current profession as a stand-up comic on his release from jail in 2009. According to his personal website he now does as many as seven performances a week. In June he shared a bill with Russell Kane at a gig in Southend in Essex. Kane is best known for appearing on BBC Three's Live At The Electric. Speaking to Sun On Sunday, Haynes called his paedophilia 'the biggest regret of my life'. 'It all happened ten years ago and fortunately I've moved on,' he told the paper. 'I'm not going to do anything that wrecks that.'","Russell Haynes, 42, was jailed in 2008 after admitting indecent assault .

"He's not long started walking, but Prince Harry is already joking about training Prince George up for the London Marathon. The prince, who is patron of the event, met people who will be running on April 26 to raise money for his charities at a training session at Twickenham Rugby Stadium today. Harry said he wasn't going to run the marathon himself but joked he thought it would be a good idea to train his nephew up as he chatted with Jane Fishwick, 59, from Shrewsbury, Wiltshire.

After they met inside the England dressing room, Jane said: 'I suggested he might like to run one and he said there's a little bit of a problem there because he and William and Kate would all come under fire to do it if one of them does it. 'So then I suggested maybe they might like to train George up in good time and maybe they might like to hand the mantle on and he said he thought that might be a good idea. 'He said they could push him round.' Jane is running in the marathon to raise money for Rugby Union's Injured Players Foundation which helped her family after her son Jack, 27, who was paralysed from the waist down in a devastating accident playing rugby for Wimbledon. Jane said: 'I wanted to give something back for all they've done for us. 'They are a charity who are with you lifelong and we will benefit from their support forever. That's quite something.

"They are famed for being at each other's throats in a bloody feud that rocked the Appalachians more than a hundred years ago. But the Hatfield and McCoy families, whose saga of murder, marriage and betrayal claimed 12 lives from 1865 to 1890, have finally found a common interest - distilling liquor. Descendants of the legendary William Anderson 'Devil Anse' Hatfield and Randolph McCoy have formed a business alliance to bottle and sell branded moonshine made from an old family recipe. Scroll down for videos . Hooch, not war: Hatfields, who once fought and killed their McCoy neighbors, now produce moonshine at $32.99 a bottle out of their West Virginia brewery. Pictured above are Nancy Hatfield, the oldest living family member, and her son-in-law Chad Bishop, who runs the distillery with the help of McCoy business know-how . Long-running: The feud between families claimed at least 11 lives between 1863 and 1890. Shown above at the Hatfield family, posing at their West Virginia home . Rough justice: The Hatfields, pictured above in a 2012 dramatic adaptation starring Kevin Costner as Devil Anse (left, in black), rounded up and killed McCoy family members . Deadly: The feud escalated into open conflict in the battle of Grapevine Creek, depicted above . Their distillery in Gilbert, West Virginia, sits on old Hatfield land, not far from the Kentucky border, across which they would trade legal challenges and deadly vigilante raids with McCoy rivals in an escalating feud. But despite the decades of bad blood between them, the two families have united behind Devil Anse's recipe for home-brewed hooch. Chad Bishop, who joined the Hatfield clan by marrying Devil Anse's great-great-great granddaughter, now runs the business. Amber, his wife, and her mother Nancy - the oldest living Hatfield - also work at the distillery to produce their flagship 'Drink of the Devil' white corn whiskey, which sells at $32.99 for a 25oz bottle. Promotional material says their moonshine will 'go down smooth but kick like a mule'. Product: The family's white corn whiskey, named The Drink of the Devil, is made to an old Hatfield family recipe . Unity: The families have combined for a commercial enterprise some 150 years after first striking out at one another . Where it happens: The brewery is on old Hatfield land in Gilbert, West Virginia. The McCoys lived just over the border in Kentucky . Old-fashioned: In the above photo, Bishop shows off a fermentation tank where the liquor is made in small batches . Ronald McCoy, the great-great grandson of Randolph, worked as a consultant when the brewery started up, helping to refine the product and marketing strategy. The bloody history of the family feud dates back to the civil war, when a Hatfield Confederate militia named the Logan Wildcats reportedly gunned down Asa Harmon McCoy, a Union soldier who had come home injured. Years later bad blood worsened after the Hatfield family were accused of stealing a McCoy hog, but were acquitted in what the Kentucky family saw as a rigged court. The feuding peaked when three McCoys killed Elliston Hatfield, Devil Anse's brother, in 1882. The men were arrested, but Devil Anse organised a vigilante group who captured and killed them before their trial. Hold-up: A group of Hatfield gunmen are pictured above in the late 19th Century holding up men, possibly McCoys, on the roadside . Back and forth: This newspaper illustration imagines the scene as the McCoys storm a Hatfield stronghold in West Virginia . Six years later, Randolph McCoy's house was burned to the ground by the Hatfields, and several fleeing McCoys were shot dead, injured and beaten. In reprisal, a group of McCoy-led vigilantes rode over the border into West Virginia, killed several Hatfields and rounded up nine men to stand trial in Kentucky. All the men were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison, except for Ellison Mounts, Devil Anse's nephew, who was publicly hanged. The controversial legal process caused the Supreme Court to intervene, as West Virginia argued its citizens were illegally extradited so couldn't face trial. But the court decided their was nothing to stop the prosecution once the family was in Kentucky, and the court's punishments were exacted in full, putting a stop to the bloody exchanges.

"Carl Djerassi, the chemist widely considered the father of the birth control pill, has died. Djerrasi died of complications of cancer Friday in his San Francisco home, Stanford University spokesman Dan Stober said. He was 91. Djerassi, a professor emeritus of chemistry at Stanford, was most famous for leading a research team in Mexico City that in 1951 developed norethindrone, a synthetic molecule that became a key component of the first birth control pill. Innovator: Carl Djerassi, the chemist widely considered the father of the birth control pill, died at his San Francisco home on Friday at the age of 91 . 'The pill' as it came to be known radically transformed sexual practices and women's lives.  The pill gave women more control over their fertility than they had ever had before and permanently put doctors — who previously didn't see contraceptives as part of their job — in the birth control picture. In his book, 'This Man's Pill,' Djerassi said the invention also changed his life, making him more interested in how science affects society. In 1969, he submitted a public policy article about the global implications of U.S. contraceptive research, according to the Stanford News Service. In 1970, he published another article about the feasibility of a birth control pill for men. 'The thoughts behind these two public policy articles had convinced me that politics, rather than science, would play the dominant role in shaping the future of human birth control,' he wrote. Later in life, Djerassi, a native of Austria who came to the U.S. in 1939 with his mother, wrote poems, short stories and plays. He used stock earnings from the company that made the pill to help collect Paul Klee art work, which he donated to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Inventor: Djerassi, a professor emeritus of chemistry at Stanford, was most famous for leading a research team in Mexico City that in 1951 developed norethindrone, a synthetic molecule that became a key component of the first birth control pill . 'Carl Djerassi is probably the greatest chemist our department ever had,' Richard N. Zare, the Marguerite Blake Wilbur Professor in Natural Science at Stanford, said in an obituary released by the university. 'I know of no person in the world who combined the mastery of science with literary talent as Carl Djerassi.' 'He also is the only person, to my knowledge, to receive from President Nixon the National Medal of Science and to be named on Nixon's blacklist in the same year,' Zare added. Djerassi told the Chronicle last year he was tired of talking about the pill. 'Carl did many things in his life — he was a true Renaissance man and scholar,' Philip Darney, a contraceptive scientist and director of the University of California, San Francisco's Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health, told the Chronicle. He is survived by a son, Dale Djerassi; a stepdaughter, Leah Middlebrook; and a grandson, Alexander M. Djerassi.","Carl Djerassi passed away at his San Francisco home on Friday .

"A U.S. defense contractor confirmed Sunday that two of its American employees were shot at in Saudi Arabia, marking the second time in less than four months that the company's staff has been targeted. Friday's shooting is likely to deepen the sense of unease among the Western expatriates working in the kingdom, which is part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants and has been on heightened alert about possible terrorist attacks. Vinnell Arabia said in a brief statement that the shooting took place in the oil-rich kingdom's eastern al-Ahsa province. 'Both employees were injured but are in stable condition at a local hospital. We are working closely with the Saudi authorities and the U.S. State Department in response to their ongoing inquiries,' the company said. The two Americans who were shot work for Vinnell Arabia, a U.S. defense contractor which trains the Saudi Arabian National Guard. Above, officers graduating from the Saudi National Guard in 2008 . The official Saudi Press Agency said the Americans came under fire 'from an unknown source' as they were traveling along a road in the city of al-Mubarraz at around 2pm local time Friday. It said only one of the Americans was injured. Authorities have launched an investigation into the shooting. In October, a Vinnell employee was killed and another was wounded in a shooting near the company's facilities in the capital, Riyadh. Saudi officials blamed that shooting on Saudi-American dual national Abdulaziz Fahad Abdulaziz Alrashid, 24, who had recently been fired from the company for drug-related issues. He was arrested by police. Vinnell Arabia is partly owned by Falls Church, Virginia-based Northrop Grumman Corp. It has been active in the kingdom for decades and is involved in training and providing additional support to the Saudi Arabian National Guard, which is a separate force from the country's military. From 2003 to 2007, al-Qaida linked militants carried out attacks in Saudi Arabia aimed at destabilizing the Western-allied monarchy, including deadly bombings of residential compounds housing foreigners in Riyadh in 2003.","Two employees of defense contractor Vinnell Arabia shot Friday .

"New grilling: Shrien Dewani during his trial in South Africa. The millionaire could face his first public questioning over his wife's death in a UK inquest . Shrien Dewani could face his first public questioning under oath over the murder of his wife Anni on their honeymoon in South Africa in a resumed UK inquest into her death. The North London coroner has reportedly told the care home millionaire he is considering resuming the inquest into the 2010 death, which was adjourned during the police investigation. A South African court in December cleared Mr Dewani of involvement in his wife's murder, but there were complaints from Anni's family that the Bristol-based businessman was not forced to testify. South African prosecutors had alleged that Mr Dewani was a bisexual who arranged his wife's murder to cover up for his double life as a client of sadomasochistic male prostitutes. North London coroner Andrew Walker has now emailed individuals linked to the case to tell them he is ready to resume the inquest into Anni's death, The Sun reports. The Sun says Anni's father, Vinod Hindocha, and her uncle, Ashok Hindocha, are due to meet Mr Walker on Tuesday to discuss the case. MailOnline contacted the coroner's office on Sunday morning, but no-one was able to comment or confirm the report. It comes after a formal complaint was last week lodged against the judge presiding over Dewani's trial. A group of academics and lawyers from South Africa's Higher Education Transformation Network (HETN) criticised Judge Jeanette Traverso's handling of the case last year, accusing her of 'gross judicial bias and misconduct'. The judge called a halt to the trial in December, two months into the hearing, after an application from Mr Dewani's counsel that the prosecution case was flawed. Mr Dewani, 34, fought a long UK court battle against extradition before being sent to South Africa where he was cleared of instigating a plot to murder Anni. The Swedish-raised engineer was shot dead as the couple toured a rough suburb of Cape Town on November 13, 2010. Tragic: Mr Dewani with his wife Anni, who was shot dead in a taxi after it was carjacked as it made its way through a rough suburb of Cape Town in 2010. Her husband was left by the side of the road . Grief: Vinod Hindocha weeps in court during Mr Dewani's trial. He has said the case was not fully heard because Judge Jeanette Traverso, right, threw it out before Mr Dewani took to the witness stand . HETN chairman Lucky Thekisho said: 'Article five of the Judicial Code of Ethics requires judges to act honourably not only in the discharge of official duties but to act honourably and in a manner befitting judicial office in a professional manner that enhances the public trust in or respect for the judiciary and the judicial system.' North London coroner Andrew Walker, who has emailed individuals linked to the case to tell them he is ready to resume the inquest into Anni's death . Lawyer Mr Thekisho urged South African judicial authorities to suspend Judge Traverso pending an investigation. Ashok Hindocha - the victim's uncle, and one of several members of her family to sit through the trial in Cape Town - told the Press Association: 'We agree that Anni did not get a fair trial. 'The case was not fully heard, she (judge Traverso) should have let Shrien take the stand.' Three men - Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni - already serving jail terms for their role in the killing claimed Mr Dewani arranged a hijacking-gone wrong in which he would survive and his wife would be killed. But Judge Traverso ruled their evidence was flawed and the case was thrown out before Mr Dewani could give evidence in the witness box. The trial was riddled with delays while swathes of evidence were dismissed or considered irrelevant to the case. German prostitute Leopold Leisser was lined up to testify about bisexual Mr Dewani's double life, but his court appearance was reduced to little more than a 15-minute offering after the judge decided it contributed little to the evidence already submitted as part of Mr Dewani's witness statement. Qwabe struggled to tell the difference between his right and left while another star prosecution witness - self-styled middle man Monde Mbolombo - was granted immunity by the state for testifying against the Briton. Mr Dewani, who had spent eight months undergoing treatment at a hospital on the edge of Cape Town after being extradited to South Africa, was not called to give evidence in his own defence. He returned to England at the conclusion of the case without ever commenting in public. He has always denied any involvement in his wife's murder.","Dewani was cleared of murder by South African court in December .

"The driver who survived being crushed between two big rigs in a nightmare pileup on an icy Oregon freeway is sharing details of his near death experience. Kyle Whitby says that he was not scared or nervous as the event unfolded, in just seconds, knowing that God had a plan for him - and that he is no luckier than any other person. 'I'm not better,' explained the 27-year-old, who has a pregnant wife and son at home.. 'I just know that I can't control it, the Heavenly Father does have a plan for us, and we have the ability to choose and make our own choices. But he does watch out for us.' Scroll down for video . Kaleb Whitby (above with wife Camille and his son) almost lost his life in a car crash . Miracle:  Whitby, 27, posed for this photo in the twisted metal ruins of his Chevy Silverado after a horror pileup on Saturday near Baker City, Oregon . After the escape: The crumpled driver's cab of Whitby's pickup was left behind, above, after he was helped out . Caught in the middle: Whitby was left facing oncoming traffic - including the second truck - and feared dying in the crash . In fact it was business as usual for him and his family the day after the crash, as they all went to church together he told The Oregonian. His wife Camille however can't even bring herself to see the photo. 'I knew it was bad. Smashed between two semis, it's not going to be good,' she said. 'It's unreal how bad it is.' To be safe though, she pinches him from time to time to make sure he is still there. Whitby has made on minor change he admits, saying; 'I make sure to say thank you more often.' No wiggle room: The two big rigs, right, ended up practically sandwiched together in the pileup, which did not kill anybody . Whitby, 27, made headlines when a photo of him staring calmly from the mangled wreckage of his Chevy Silverado taken after the two semi-trucks smashed into each other on the I-84 in Oregon with him in the middle went public. Despite his precarious position wedged between the two metal trailers, and with a steering column tight against his leg, Whitby emerged from the deathtrap almost entirely unscathed. He posed for the photograph, taken by another truck driver involved in the  50-driver pileup, which left 18-wheelers sprawled across the icy freeway outside Baker City, Oregon. Whitby described the terrifying moments before his unlikely survival, saying he swerved to avoid a jackknifed truck - only to get crushed by another out of control big rig. He had been driving up an incline behind the vehicle for a while, Whitby said, but backed away because the fog was so thick. The next time he saw it, the big rig was splayed across the lanes of the freeway, leaving him nowhere to go. He tried to swerve round it, but hit the back end and was left sat on the road, side-on to approaching traffic. Smashed up: Whitby was caught between the two trucks pictured above in the icy, foggy and windy crash . Huge: As many as 50 vehicles, mostly trucks, were caught up in the wreckage . Next, he noticed a second big rig barreling towards him, with no way to avoid him. 'I just braced and hoped that everything would be all right', Whitby said. The next thing he knew, the crash was over and he was surrounded by broken glass and mangled metal - but was otherwise unharmed. Whitby, a farmer from Pasco, Washington, managed to cut himself free of his seatbelt, and move the steering column from his leg. He then shouted for help - and was rescued by Sergi Karplyuk, who drove the second truck in the crash. Whitby, now safe, posed for the incredible picture before getting out. After looking himself over, Whitby realized he was hardly injured at all. He told The Oregonian: 'I've got two Band-Aids on my right ring finger. And a little bit of ice on my left eye.' Twelve people were taken to hospital as a result of the pileup, one of whom was in critical condition Sunday. The freeway has since been re-opened. More than 20 cars piled up on I-76 in Philadelphia after freezing rain on Sunday morning . At least four people have died and dozens more injured after freezing rain hit the Northeast on Sunday morning. A pair of multi-car pileups - including one involving dozens of vehicles - in icy conditions on interstates in the Philadelphia area claimed at least three lives as authorities reported hundreds of crashes were reported across eastern Pennsylvania. A crash involving an estimated 30 to 50 vehicles on Interstate 76 early on Sunday killed one person, state police said. The crash blamed on 'flash-freezing' prompted closure of the highway in both directions, although one lane was reopened in the afternoon. Two other people were killed in a crash involving multiple vehicles on Interstate 476, police said. In Connecticut, police cited slippery conditions in a crash that killed an 88-year-old woman who struck a utility pole in New Haven. Splayed: This mail truck and another container vehicle were badly damaged on the Oregon road . Caved cab: Another busted big rig is pictured on the road amidst the devastation caused by the pileup .

"The 103-year-old campaigner and inspiration behind civil rights film Selma has spoken of the savage beating she received that became the iconic image of police brutality at the time. Amelia Boynton Robinson said she 'froze' after seeing Alabama state troopers on horseback riding towards protesters with batons and gas masks in scenes that shocked the world. After being struck repeatedly, she lost consciousness - and the harrowing image of the 52-year-old widow in the arms of a fellow protester helped secure voting reform in the state for black people. Scroll down for video . Seen around the world: Amelia Boynton Robinson is held after being violently beaten by Alabama State Troopers during an attempted protest march from Selma to Alabama's state capital ­Montgomery . On March 7, 1965, Ms Boynton Robinson and 600 others attempted to march from the town of Selma to Alabama's capital ­Montgomery. They were protesting the fact that African Americans were being denied the right to vote in the state. The monumental event has now been immortalised on the big screen with a highly-acclaimed new movie Selma - about Martin Luther King's civil rights movement. Ms Boynton Robinson, whoo has campaigned for equality all of her life, believes the timing of the film's release is fitting as protests continue in America over the killings of black men by police officers. Lifelong campaigner: Amelia Boynton Robinson is still fighting for equality half a century on from the incident that shocked the world . Speaking to The Sunday Mirror about the moment protesters were charged, she said: 'I think I was frozen. It was not because of fear. It was ­amazement, of people being beaten. 'I saw blood on the highway, I saw people falling. An officer on horseback hit me across the back of the shoulders and on the back of the neck. I lost consciousness.' She later added: 'It's ­important that young people know about the struggles we faced to get to the point we are at today. Only then will they ­appreciate the hard-won freedom of blacks in this country.' Ms Boynton Robinson was raised in a time when black Americans were prohibited from sitting near the front on buses for from drinking from 'white' water ­fountains. Addressing the shameful period in American history, Selma is now a favourite for best film at the Oscars on February 22. It has also been nominated for four Golden Globes, including a best actor nod for British star David Oyelowo as Dr King, . Released in the UK on Friday, the film focuses on what became known as Bloody Sunday, and two other marches - organised around Ms Boynton Robinson's kitchen table in Selma. Happy to see movie: The 103-year-old believes the timing of the film's release is fitting as protests continue in America over the killings of black men by police officers . Tribute: Ten years ago a monument in Amelia Boynton Robinson's honour was unveiled at the bridge where she was beaten unconscious by Alabama state troopers . At the time of the real event, segregation laws in the Deep South meant it was even illegal for more than two black people to congregate in the street. Of the 30,000 people who lived in Selma, half were black - but only 156 could vote because of the ridiculous red tape set in place by the state. Ms Boynton Robinson was one of the first lack people to vote in 1932 after passing literacy tests and paying fees beyond the reach of many people. After campaigning to change the prejudiced local voting rules, she came to the attention of Dr King and other national civil rights leaders. Like Dr King, she advocated non-violent acts of civil disobedience and when she set off at the head of the march she says she was 'not looking for notoriety.' Portrayal: Ms Boynton Robinson is played by Lorraine Toussaint in Selma - the highly-acclaimed new movie about Martin Luther King's civil rights movement . Cast: (L-R) Colman Domingo, David Oyelowo, Ava DuVernay and Tom Wilkinson at the 'Selma' film premiere, London last week . She vividly recalls the line of police waiting for them on a bridge ad recalls being hit across her shoulders, back and neck with a police baton before losing consciousness. She was left for dead by police officers who pumped tear gas into her eyes and throat - before being dragged to an ambulance by a young stranger. After discharging herself from hospital two days later she joined Dr King on a second march to Montgomery and soon discovered her face had been seen around the world. President Lyndon B Johnson changed voting laws in reaction to the incident and five months later invited Ms Boynton Robinson to the Whte House as he signed the .

"A man who received more than $1 million in compensation after he fractured his neck at a rugby league match has spent almost all of it within four months, a tribunal has heard. Jason Cooper was at a Canberra Raiders game at Canberra Stadium when he broke his neck trying to catch a football at half-time as part of an audience competition on August 6 2006. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal heard Cooper claimed a lump sum of $1,025,000 for personal injury last year, meaning he would no longer be eligible to receive Centrelink support until 2017. Cooper said that he received a net amount of $516,236.65 from the settlement money after disbursements, consisting of $440,000 from the settlement itself and a Medicare refund. Scroll down for video . Jason Cooper broke his neck trying to catch a football at a Canberra Raider's match in August 2006 . When the Canberra resident received the settlement payment in February 2014, he decided to buy a three-bedroom home near Bateman's Bay, south coast of NSW so his two daughters and grandchildren have a place to stay when they come visit. Cooper told the tribunal that his mother is currently living with him and during the time, he decided to buy new furniture and appliances because he did not want to use his mother's old items. Other items that Cooper purchased included a ride-on mower, mobility scooter, fishing equipment, vacuum cleaner and steamer, sport memorabilia, model cars and solar power installations. Cooper told the tribunal that he needed his stereo system and four television sets to help occupy his time . Along with his purchases, Cooper also bought a mobility scooter which set him back $5,500 . The tribunal said his purchases were 'unwise, irresponsible and unnecessary' after he was 'aware of the necessity to use the settlement money in a sensible manner and to set aside sufficient funds to meet his living costs during the preclusion period'. 'The Tribunal concluded that the expenditure of the settlement money was not reasonable and his circumstances, including his financial situation, do not give rise to special circumstances.' Cooper also repaid personal loans in full and gave his daughter $14,500 to help her boyfriend purchase a motor vehicle. He said it was a gesture of his appreciation for his daughter’s efforts to helping the family financially after his accident when he could no longer work. Cooper agreed that many items he purchased were not necessities but claimed that he was unable to check his spendings because he did not have access to internet banking. The tribunal said he made 'unnecessary' purchases from his own choices including his fishing equipment .

"There was a time not so long ago that when you bought milk, your choice wouldn’t stretch beyond full-fat, skimmed or semi-skimmed. But not any more. A whole industry has sprung up to offer a plethora of alternative milks — from almond and coconut to hemp and soya . They’re catering to the increasing numbers of Britons who are lactose-intolerant, who oppose the disturbing treatment of factory-farmed cows or who simply hate the taste of cow’s milk. Scroll down for video . There's a whole host of milk alternatives on the market these days, we've taken a look at what's on offer . Even Coca-Cola has a souped-up version, Fairlife. It is yet to launch in the UK, but the firm says thanks to a special filtration system, it will halve milk’s normal sugar levels, while increasing the calcium and protein content by 50 per cent. Here, top dietitians help Etan Smallman test six other milks on offer . . . LACTOSE-FREE . LactoFree (£1.35 per litre at most supermarkets) Sioned Quirke, the dietitian and spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association, says that lactose-free milk, such as LactoFree (£1.35 per litre at most supermarkets), offers all the positives of normal milk, but with the lactose (a natural sugar in milk that causes digestion problems for those who are intolerant) broken down by an added enzyme. As for taste, it is indistinguishable from cow’s milk, and the nutritional composition is almost the same. The LactoFree full-fat variety has 3.5g of fat per 100ml, 3.4g of protein and 57 calories. (Full-fat cow’s milk typically has 4g of fat per 100ml, 3.4g of protein and 68 calories). Sioned adds: ‘As with cow’s milk, the lactose-free milks come with different percentages of fat. So, unless you’re underweight, go for the lower fat version.’ Nutritionist and registered dietitian Nicole Rothband says: ‘The lactose is broken down into simple sugars so it doesn’t cause any gastro-intestinal disturbance.’ ALMOND MILK . Alpro Original Almond milk (£1.79 per litre at supermarkets nationwide) For those looking for non-animal-derived milk, almond milk has become hugely popular. David Cameron apparently has it on his cereal and in his tea as a calorie-reducing measure. It has 24 calories per 100ml — half that of semi-skimmed milk. But it also has much less protein. While semi-skimmed has 3.6g per 100ml, almond has 0.5g. Alpro Original Almond milk (£1.79 per litre at supermarkets nationwide) lists sugar as the second ingredient, which explains why it’s the sweetest-tasting of the bunch. It has a mildly nutty kick, although the actual almond content is just 2 per cent. Sioned recommends buying the unsweetened version, although one benefit of almond milk is that it contains vitamin E, which is good for the skin. SOYA MILK . Alpro Original (£1.39 per litre at supermarkets nationwide) Soya milk is the closest in protein levels to normal milk, with 3g per 100ml in Alpro Original (£1.39 per litre at supermarkets nationwide) and 40 calories. Taste-wise, it is pleasant with a slightly sweet flavour, but you can sense the difference in tea or coffee, and it does leave an after-taste. Sioned says: ‘Soya milk wouldn’t affect your cholesterol levels, as it has minimal levels of saturated fat. It is suitable for people on a lactose-free diet, as it’s a good source of protein and calcium.’ COCONUT MILK . Koko Dairy Free (£1.39 per litre at supermarkets nationwide) Koko Dairy Free (£1.39 per litre at supermarkets nationwide) contains 8.4 per cent coconut milk, with added calcium and vitamins D2 and B12. It has a sweet and tangy taste, with the coconut coming through strongly. Our dietitians point out that its protein content is very low (0.2g per 100ml), but while semi-skimmed milk has 1.8g of fat per 100ml, the coconut alternative has a full 2g, and 27 calories. HEMP MILK . Good Hemp (£1.99 per litre, available at Holland & Barrett) Hemp milk, such as Good Hemp (£1.99 per litre, available at Holland & Barrett) comes with 2.5g of fat per 100ml and less than 0.1g of protein, but it does provide half of your daily intake of omega 3 per glass. To my taste buds, it is the most neutral when taken with hot drinks or cereals. Sioned says: ‘With 2.5g of fat per 100ml, hemp milk is quite high and wouldn’t be good for your cholesterol levels.’ RICE MILK . Rice Dream (£1.38 per litre in most supermarkets) Rice Dream (£1.38 per litre in most supermarkets) is fortified with calcium and vitamins D2 and B12. It is low in fat (1g per 100ml), but also disappointingly low in protein (0.1g per 100ml). With 47 calories per 100ml, its energy content is identical to that of semi-skimmed. It has a light flavour that doesn’t really resemble cow’s milk, but with a slight sweetness. However, Nicole Rothband says: ‘Rice milk is not suitable for children under the age of five as a main drink because of the levels of arsenic in it [low levels of arsenic are found naturally in rice].’ DIETITIANS’ VERDICT . Sioned says: ‘If you have a need for a cow’s milk substitute, then these variations are great. But, if not, they tend to be more expensive, not as readily available and have a very different taste.’ Nicole says: ‘If it’s on a taste basis, that’s fine, but there’s a lot less protein in these types of milk. There are also a lot fewer calories, so people may find it useful if they’re trying to lose weight. ‘I would be wary of how much sugar has been added to these milks, and choose one that states that it has calcium and vitamins added. Otherwise, I would suggest people taste a variety and see which one they like best.’","A whole industry has developed around alternative milks .

"An Iraq war hero whose bravery earned him one of Britain’s highest military decorations is selling his medal collection because he is too ill to work. Colour Sergeant James Harkess, 46, hopes his medals – including the rare Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for ‘exceptional bravery’ – will sell for £120,000. He received the CGC after putting himself in the line of fire to lead his men through three firefights in just two months. Scroll down for video . Colour Sergeant James Harkess is to sell his Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, awarded for his bravery after he put his life at risk three times to save his men but ill health has meant he is now unable to work . In one, he and his Warrior armoured vehicle crew were lucky to survive a six-hour battle on June 11, 2006, fighting off 200 Mahdi Army soldiers in Al Amarah. The four-man team was attacked with rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns, sniper fire and blast bombs. Sergeant Harkess, who spent much of the battle exposed from the turret, said: ‘It was constant. There was no let-up, and I was firing all through. My crew took down 50 enemy in total easily. They were coming at us in waves – you could see bodies stacked up where we’d been killing them. ‘Guys would jump on rooftops five metres away and start firing. You’d put them down, then more would be there a minute later.’ The platoon sergeant with the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment, who left the Army last year after 22 years, said: ‘I loved the Army. I miss it but when it’s your time to leave, you have to go. I have all the memories I require.’ Sgt Harkess is due to sell his gallantry medal - one down from the Victoria Cross - for around £120,000 . Sgt Harkess is seen with Warrior fighting vehicles, previously helping off 200 soldiers from the Mahdi Army . Speaking of his medals, he added: ‘They should raise a substantial amount. I suffer from ill-health which has meant I have not been able to work. ‘Because of this I am dependent on my Army pension so the sale will help me financially.’ Sergeant Harkess, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, was also awarded his Conspicuous Gallantry Cross – just one down from the Victoria Cross – for two other battles. On May 23 2006, he rescued his platoon after securing a route to safety having been cut off by 50 militiamen. Sgt Harkess was part of a crew who took down 50 enemy soldiers, who he said were coming at them in waves . Then, on July 30 that year, he fearlessly led his crew towards the enemy after an ambush on a night supply convoy. With his men pinned down, he personally found the three snipers who had them cornered and killed two. Pierce Noonan, of London auctioneer Dix Noonan Webb, which is selling the medals on February 25, said: ‘James Harkess showed astonishing bravery and leadership during some of the most ferocious street fighting since the Second World War. Such men are a very special breed.’ Sgt Harkess is to sell a number of his medals, seen here (top right) with his belongings collected in Iraq . The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC) is the second highest military medal that can be awarded to members of the United Kingdom's armed forces. Presented in 'recognition of an act or acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations against the enemy', the medal was introduced in 1993 and is second only to the Victoria Cross. It was introduced after a review of the honours system as part of a drive to remove distinctions of rank in awards for bravery, replacing both the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal, and can also be awarded posthumously. All ranks of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force can be awarded the CGC, with further medal-worthy acts of gallantry honoured with a bar which can be added to the medal. The CGC is silver and in the shape of a cross, with a laurel wreath underneath and is mounted on a white ribbon with blue and crimson stripes. A recipient's rank, name and unit are engraved on the reverse. Corporal Wayne Mills was the first gazetted recipient of the CGC. While serving with the 1st Battalion The Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) on UN Service in Bosnia in 1994, his patrol came under  fire, from a group of Bosnian Serbs. The patrol returned fire, killing two of the attackers but became vulnerable to futher attack when they reached an open clearing. Corporal Mills then  turned back into the wood and engaged the attacking group, delaying them long enough to allow the rest of his patrol to cross the clearing. Corporal Mills shot the leader of the group, causing the rest to scatter and returned to his patrol safely.","Colour Sgt James Harkess was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross .

'The rest of the week is looking much drier, though the cold weather will continue.' The coldest temperature recorded so far this winter was -12.5C in Scotland on January 18. Helen Rossington, forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: ‘The cold spell won’t end for a while yet – until late next week at least. The cold air was brought in by northerly winds last week and a high pressure system means it has stayed with us.’ The bone-chilling temperatures follow the sunniest January in more than ten years. Meanwhile, the extreme conditions are believed to have contributed to the death of a climber killed in an avalanche in the Scottish Highlands on Friday. Mountain rescue teams and the Stornoway coastguard helicopter searched for the man, who was with one other climber, on Friday night but were forced to call it off because the weather was so bad.

The search resumed on Saturday afternoon and one of the climbers was found walking out to find help - but tragically when rescue teams reached his companion he was already dead. Heavy snow and strong winds, persistent in the Highlands over the last month, are believed to have played a part in the avalanche. A force spokesman said: 'On the Friday night police were alerted to two overdue climbers who had undertaken climbs on Coireag Dubh Mor in the Torridon area of the western Highlands. 'Torridon Mountain Rescue Team were alerted and air assistance was provided by Stornoway coastguard helicopter. 'Poor weather conditions made for difficult search conditions.

A report is being submitted to the procurator fiscal.' Both men - from Suffolk - were experienced climbers with the proper equipment, police said. In 2012, the last full year for which figures are available, rescue teams helped 720 people with 240 injured and 25 fatalities in Scotland's mountains. Advice was issued earlier this year to walkers, climbers and skiers. Mark Diggins, from the Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service, said: 'Many thousands of enthusiasts enjoy the Scottish mountains every winter. 'However, the fast-changing weather, with its snowfall, avalanche hazard, strong winds and poor visibility, requires us to be much more prepared when going into the mountains in the winter.

Extreme conditions plagued the whole of the UK last week with a rare 'thundersnow' storm causing icy roads and leading to widespread travel disruption. Also predicting more severe conditions, George Goodfellow, a forecaster at MeteoGroup, added: 'Temperatures are looking widely low single figures, with really strong northwesterly winds making wind chill a factor. There will be some quite cold nights with sub-zero temperatures. 'We are expecting a lot of places could be dry but there may be some showers on the east coast and the north, which could get icy.' Met Office amber warnings are in place across much of northern England with more snow and cold weather predicted until Thursday and gusts of up to 60 and 70mph in some places. Heavy snow was expected to settle in highland areas of northern Scotland by as much as 25cm (10in). The man and his companion, who survived, went missing while climbing on Coireag Dubh Mor in the Torridon area of the western Highlands . A group of cyclists carry their mountain bikes around the edge of Mam Tor overlooking the Edale valley in the Derbyshire Peak District . The alert read: 'Colder conditions will arrive from the north during this coming weekend. The cold accentuated by strong winds at times. Snow showers will affect a number of areas through this period. More sheltered southern areas of England will see fewer showers. 'Overnight frosts will give icy stretches on untreated surfaces, with the possibility of widespread ice. Less cold conditions might develop later next week.' It warned the public to take care on the roads during the period.

"They made her Britain's most-hated scrounger - and Josie Cunningham's latest publicity-hungry stunt involved celebrating the anniversary of her NHS boob job. The mother-of-three sported a blonde wig and a tiny orange crop top on a wild night out in London's Soho to celebrate the second birthday of her taxpayer-funded breasts. Ahead of her night out, she took to Twitter to say: '2 years today I got my pair of double D's David and dwight. Cameron's a right t** - just like mine xxx'. Scroll down for video . Dubbed the most hated woman in Britain, Josie Cunningham hit London's Soho on Friday night to celebrate the two-year anniversary of her NHS boob op . After playing up to the cameras on her night out, she was pictured falling over and looking worse for wear . Playing up to the cameras, she blew on party horns and pinned a large badge reading 'It's my birthday' on the back of the skintight grey leggings. And true to form, pictures showed her stumbling around the streets, flashing the birthday boobs and eventually end up on the floor. Earlier this month, the wannabe glamour model shamelessly invited Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to her celebrations, adding she wanted to show him she was 'grateful' for the operation. She tweeted the MP: 'Having a birthday party for my boobies at the end of the month. 'To show how grateful I am… Wanna come?' Sporting a blonde wig, Miss Cunningham stepped out in a tiny orange crop top and pinned a birthday badge to her tight grey leggings . Ahead of her night out, the mother-of-three tweeted her excitement at celebrating the anniversary of her op . Miss Cunningham first hit the headlines two years ago when she sparked fury after receiving a £4,800 boob job on the NHS, taking her from a 32A to a 36DD. The tale, about how the single mother on benefits, was given a free breast enlargement, sparked instant outrage in a Britain just emerging from recession. She followed that appearance with another, this time on Page 3, which showed off the results of the operation and left little to the imagination. Revelling in the furore, she then made appearances in which she played on her new-found infamy, most notoriously when she stepped out topless with her nipples covered with NHS-branded tape. Miss Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her unborn child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother of three later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

Posting on Instagram and Twitter, Cousins included a screenshot of the tweet and a caption: 'Today's the day!! Let's all show him some love!!' A few hours later, Travis tweeted back to Cousins that he'd be donating to charity in his name for the tweet. 'Funny and well played,' Travis wrote Friday. '$5k to your charity of choice.

The book includes 200 eerie images of 'urban decay,' according to Amazon, and Ellis said he spent a lot of time doing research on the locations he photographed. 'It's one thing to write up an article for the internet, but having it in print meant there was a lot of pressure to get things right,' Ellis told Untapped. He said the book has been in the works for the last two years and he is excited to 'finally get it into people's hands.' Scroll down for video .

"Ministry of Justice officials have been forced to remove 'terribly wrong' guidance for disabled people which suggested that suspects had to prove their innocence when accused of a crime. A leading QC condemned the error saying it went against a 'fundamental' cornerstone of British law which placed the burden of proof on the prosecution. The simplified guide, which was aimed at those with learning difficulties and a limited grasp of English, used illustrations and text to help people understand the court process. The simplified guide used illustrations and text to help people understand the court process . The presumption of innocence is a right with origins that can be traced back to the Magna Carta . It said: 'If you say you did not do a crime, you may have to go back to the Court on a different day, to show the Court you did not do the crime. This is called a trial.' Mukul Chawla QC, who highlighted the error on Twitter, said: 'What on Earth? Has the Ministry of Justice changed the law on the burden of proof anyone noticing?' He told The Independent: 'They've got it so terribly wrong here... It's the most fundamental thing that the burden of proof will always be on the prosecution and if you're producing an easy-read guide to these proceedings, the last thing you want to do is misrepresent something as basic as that. Mukul Chawla QC highlighted the error on Twitter and said: 'Has the Ministry of Justice changed the law on the burden of proof anyone noticing?' 'While I'm delighted that anyone wants to produce easy reads to difficult subjects including going to court, the basic principle has to be that they get the law right.' The presumption of innocence is a right with origins that can be traced back to the Magna Carta, which has its 800th anniversary this year. Experts said the MoJ document must have been produced by people with no legal experience and then published before it was checked. Legal blogger Jack of Kent said: 'What makes this particularly worrying is that it is in an official document – supposed to be authoritative and reliable – aimed at people with learning difficulties facing trials for serious crimes (the Crown Court is for serious crimes and its trials are with juries, the magistrates' courts do not have juries and are for less serious crimes). 'What has probably happened is that the copywriter had no legal qualifications or experience. And the Easy Read was then published without anyone with legal qualifications or experience at the MoJ bothering to check that the Easy Read was accurate – that is, before publishing it for people with learning difficulties to rely on when they are accused of serious crimes. 'The MoJ is not in a good state internally; but telling people with learning difficulties that they are guilty if accused of serious crimes unless they can prove they are innocent is surely a low-point.' A MoJ spokesman said: 'Easy read guides are an important way of providing information to people in simple and straightforward language. It is crucial to ensure these documents are precise and as helpful as possible.

The port-a-loos quickly catch on fire, with sparks flying over the road at the portable toilets swing dangerously all over the road . Several men in the cabin can be heard retching, on the verge of vomiting as the stench fills the air. NT Police duty superintendent Bob Harrison says he is well aware of the crime, thanks to the criminals conveniently uploading footage of their stupid stunt, according to NT News. He condemns their deplorable actions and cannot believe that the people responsible would be so stupid to not only engage in the stunt but make the incriminating footage public. ‘I have no understanding of what makes grown men behave in such a manner, I would have to question their IQ,’ Supt Harrison told NT News. “The fact that it emitted sparks poses a danger to anyone in the area,” he said. “They are obviously proud of their achievement but I would say that their age matches their shoe size.” Police are investigating the theft, the dangerous nature of the motor crime and the damage to property, including the port-a-loos and the roads.

"Fifty Shades of Grey is set to feature more sex on screen than the 100 raunchiest films released in 2014 put together, making it the most erotic mainstream movie in a decade. The film, which premieres on Valentine's Day features a dozen sex scenes, which make up 20 minutes of its total 100-minute running time. This follows an interview with actor Jamie Dornan, who plays main man Christian Grey, where he says he 'does not believe it is pornographic or even erotic.' Scroll down for video .

Fifty Shades Of Grey, which stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Dornan as the BDSM-loving  Christian Grey, is one of the most eagerly awaited films of the year, and its trailer has already been viewed more than 45 million times on YouTube. But Mrs Taylor-Johnson, 47, said that although the film is true to E L James's best-selling book, it may not be as explicit as people might be hoping for. 'The thing that was most difficult was how and where to pepper the sex, and to not make it feel like it was gratuitous,' she said. 'So it had to be a really strong part of the story, and I had to give characterisation to each sex scene, to make them different.

'I didn't want it to be graphically explicit, and I know that's going to be disappointing to some people,' Mrs Taylor-Johnson, who is married to British actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson, 24, added in an interview with The Guardian newspaper: . 'It's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality. So I don't think it goes into the realm of porn.' Asked if he felt he had lived up to E L James's fantasies, Dornan, 32, told the Sunday Times Culture supplement: 'Nobody can walk in and embody what she wants. It doesn't exist. 'But I hope I'm the closest thing. I hope I'm a good enough actor, and it's passable.' The father-of-one also said that although the film is sexual, he does not believe it is pornographic or even erotic. 'I just wouldn't use the word 'erotic' - it brings up different ideas for me.

"Andy Murray lost to Novak Djokovic after a well-fought battle at the Australian Open court earlier today. The Scotsman may have missed out on the trophy but his fiancée Kim Sears, 27, was on hand to console the tennis champ while Novak celebrated his triumph alone as wife Jelena, 28, remained at home in Monte Carlo, with their three-month old son. It’s just the latest on-court meeting between Andy and Novak and as Murray prepares to fly home, we examine how their off-court partners– who share seemingly identical tanned good looks, perfect hair and sparkling engagement rings – match up. Scroll down for video . Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic have fought a close battle throughout their careers. Their partners Jelena Djokovic and Kim Sears are equally matched. FEMAIL looks at the Tennis WAGs. Andy's loyal fiancee Kim is attracted even more attention courtside today than usual with her statement sweater and long golden locks, a position usually mirrored by Novak's wife Jelena, 28, were she not needed at home to babysit their young child. The two women share many traits - they are both known for their outlandish support of their partners in the bleachers and  the press love to follow their fashion choices at every competition. The ladies are also both huge dog lovers, close to their family and place an emphasis on maintaining  interests outside of their famous partner's sporting commitments. Both tennis stars have also widely credited their WAGs for keeping their feet on the ground in what is an extremely nomadic and fraught career path. So FEMAIL put the two women head-to-head, to see who wins the TWAG trophy (the cup that REALLY matters): . Jelena wells up while watching Novak at Wimbledon in 2011 (left), while Kim (right) is caught telling one of Andy's opponents to to mouth 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***' at the Australian Open last week . Courtside manner: . Kim and Jelena both find it impossible to keep a poker face when watching their partners battle it out on the tennis court. The women regularly appear on the brink of tears or react angrily to the decisions made by the umpire. Jelena once said of her inability to control her emotions during competitions: 'You can get very passionate when watching your boyfriend from the players' box. 'We just want them to be happy. You don't want to see them in pain. If they are not happy, neither are you.' Just last week, Kim was caught on camera mouthing 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***' at the Australian Open last week to Andy's opponent Tomas Berdych.. Kim shows off her diamond engagement ring at the Australian Open Tennis Championships last week (left), while a pregnant Jelena cheers on Novak at Wimbledon last summer . Relationship Status: . Andy Murray proposed to his girlfriend of eight years last autumn with a three-carat diamond ring said to be worth around £200,000. The couple have already been living together in a mansion in Oxshoot, Surrey, for more than three years. Childhood sweethearts Jelena and Novak married last July in the grounds of Montenegro's exclusive Aman Sveti Stefan resort. Jelena, who was pregnant at the time with the couple's first child, wore a dressed designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen. The couple have since welcomed their son Stefan into the world, in October last year, which is the reason that Jelena is missing from her usual court-side spot at this year's Australian Open.

Kim Sears fans envy the 27-year-old as much for her long bouncy locks as for her money-can't-buy courtside seats. The golden barnet is now so well-known that it has spawned a twitter handle of it's own - Kim Sears Hair, which describes itself as: 'I'm fabulous. I am the gorgeous mane you all love.'

In the early days of her relationship with Novak, Jelena was a successful model, starring in several high profile campaigns, including Figleaves (pictured above).

"Eric Garner's daughter believes it was not racism but pride that led officer Daniel Pantaleo to choke her father to death. Protesters chanting 'black lives matter' have stormed the streets of New York for days since a grand jury refused to charge Pantaleo over Garner's death last July. But his daughter Erica Garner dismissed the anti-racism chants, saying: 'This is not a black and white issue. This is a national crisis.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Pride not racism: Erica Garner said she thinks Daniel Pantaleo killed her father in a chokehold to be 'top cop' Protests: Thousands have taken to the streets to protest racism after a grand jury refused to indict Pantaleo . She continued: 'It was about the officer's pride. It was about my father being 6'4"" and 350 pounds and he wants to be the top cop that brings a man down.' Pressed by CNN's Don Lemon on whether race played a part in her father's death, Erica responded: 'I really doubt it'. She said she will never forgive officer Pantaleo and called on him to admit guilt. The interview on Thursday came amid national outcry over the grand jury decision to indict neither Pantaleo nor Darren Wilson, who shot dead unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9 this year. And even former president George W Bush remarked that he felt it is 'it's sad that race continues to play such...an emotional, divisive part of life.' 'I thought how sad. The verdict was hard to understand,' Bush told CNN's Candy Crowley in a clip on an interview the network plans to air during Crowley's show on Sunday, adding that he 'hadn't seen all the details.' 'I really doubt it': Ms Garner dismissed suggestions of racism surrounding her father's death last July . Distraught: She said she will never forgive Pantaleo and called on the officer to admit guilt in the case . Police arrested 223 people in New York City on Thursday night and into Friday morning as protesters took to the street for the second night of demonstrations. Demonstrators also turned out in cities including Washington D.C., Seattle, Atlanta and Oakland a day after the decision not to charge Officer Daniel Pantaleo for his role in the July incident. Although there have been no reports of violence from protesters, police made a number of arrests as scores of demonstrators shut down traffic on the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. Many arrests were made in Times Square, where police pushed back against protesters just before 11pm, and others were later arrested at Eighth Avenue and 51st Street and at Madison Avenue and 57th Street, ABC7 reported. Anger: Police are bracing themselves for days, if not weeks, of continued unrest in New York and elsewhere . Mass outcry: The grand jury verdict came after a similar decision in Ferguson, Missouri, over Michael Brown . Eric Garner's case converged with the Ferguson shooting and investigations out of South Carolina and Cleveland to stir a national conversation about racial justice and police use of force. On Facebook, a page used to aggregate protests in New York City listed plans well into the days and weeks ahead. Two rallies and a candlelight vigil were planned for later on Friday, while Saturday featured a rally in Brooklyn against police brutality. The case and that of Akai Gurley, shot dead by a rookie NYPD officer in Brooklyn, has sparked national debate . Police arrested 223 people on Thursday night and into Friday morning on the second day of demonstrations . Saturday's plans included a rally protesting the case of Akai Gurley, an unarmed black man shot and killed by a New York police officer last month in the stairwell of a public housing project. The Brooklyn District Attorney said on Friday that a grand jury would look into the case. Police officials have said the officer's gun may have discharged by accident when he was patrolling a dark stairwell.

"Prince Charles’s private office came out fighting yesterday after a controversial biography claimed he is riven by insecurities and undermined by his aides’ feuds. Officials reacted angrily to the heir’s portrayal as a man ‘driven by guilt’ who flies into fits of ‘royal rage’ but cannot control his courtiers’ internal squabbles. Clarence House insisted the book by Catherine Mayer – called Charles: The Heart of a King – was in no way authorised by the palace. Officials reacted angrily to Prince Charles' portrayal in a new biography as a man ‘driven by guilt’ who flies into fits of ‘royal rage’ Royal aides said the book's author Catherine Mayer (pictured) did not have 'exclusive access' to the heir to the throne . Attempting to refocus attention on the Prince’s extensive charity work, aides last night described him as a man who ‘cares deeply’ about his country and has frequently been ‘ahead of his time’. Charles is at the heart of a massive international charity empire that in recent years has helped raise more than £100million a year for his good causes – which range from rescuing historic buildings to helping young people get a start in life. A Clarence House spokesman said Charles had devoted most of his working life to ‘helping individual and organisations make a difference for the better – and not for personal gain’. She added: ‘He takes an active interest in the issues and challenges facing the UK and around the world through his own work and that of his charities. ‘Over the past 40 years in his role as heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales has visited countless places and met numerous people from every walk of life. He carries out over 600 engagements a year. ‘This gives him a unique perspective which has often led to him identifying issues before others which might otherwise be overlooked. Clarence House insisted the book by Catherine Mayer – called Charles: The Heart of a King – was in no way authorised by the palace . ‘He is often described as being ahead of his time and the evidence for this has been well documented – and includes leading the work on corporate social responsibility from as early as the 1980s, demonstrating the benefits of organic farming, as well as finding ways to help young people who are not in employment, education or training through his Prince’s Trust.’ Journalist Miss Mayer, editor at large for Time magazine, claims in her biography that she was given ‘remarkable access’ to the Prince and achieved ‘exclusive interviews’ with his inner circle. She was afforded a rare interview with Charles for an article published in 2013 and attended a private dinner at Dumfries House – the Ayrshire stately home Charles helped save for the nation – where she was given a tour of the estate by the heir. It is also clear she was given access to a number of Charles’s friends, including actress Emma Thompson, and senior aides past and present. Some very close to him – such as former foreign advisor Clive Alderton and long-serving private secretary Elizabeth Buchanan – allowed their comments to be reported on the record, which would never have happened without Royal approval. But Clarence House stressed the biography was not an ‘official’ one and Miss Mayer had no ‘exclusive’ access. The Prince’s spokesman said: ‘Catherine Mayer was only given access to the Prince of Wales briefly for the writing of a Time magazine feature over a year ago. ‘She is often allowed to attend events, as part of the rota like any other member of the media.’ The book, extracts of which are being serialised in The Times, says Charles feels compelled to get involved in national affairs because of the ‘guilty’ privilege of his birth. It also describes him as the ‘Prince of Wails’ with a short fuse and compares his household to Wolf Hall – a reference to the treacherous world of Henry VIII’s court as evoked in Hilary Mantel’s novel. The Prince’s spokesman added: ‘Clarence House employs over 100 hardworking professionals, many of whom have been there for decades and whose work and dedication is appreciated by Their Royal Highnesses.’ The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are planning to hire a live-in maternity nurse to help them care for their second child, it was claimed yesterday. The couple already have a nanny for 18-month-old Prince George but are thought to be looking for an extra set of hands to help with their second child, who is due in April, including looking after night feeds. Royal aides have apparently been in contact with the Norland Agency and Royal Nannies in London to find a suitable candidate to work for at least the first three months. It is thought the Duchess is hoping for a swift return to her charity work after giving birth. In a break from royal tradition, the couple did not hire a maternity nurse for George. Instead, Kate, 33, spent almost a month at her parents’ Berkshire home. A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Kate and William loved the early weeks with Prince George but it was hard work and the sleepless nights took their toll. Kate especially was exhausted.’ Last night a spokesman for William and Kate declined to comment.","Clarence House insist new Charles biography was not authorised by palace .

"In an action branded as 'callous' by the RSPCA a bag of dead puppies has been found on the banks of the Burnett River in Queensland. Brandon McMonigal's day of leisurely fishing was ruined when he happened across the bag of death near Kirby's Wall on Saturday morning. 'The tide came up and dumped the bag on the banks of the river,' he told News Mail. 'I thought it was just rubbish and went to collect the bag. 'I saw the hair and thought it was a rug at first.' The bag of dead puppies was found on the banks of the Burnett River in Queensland . It was only after taking a closer look that Mr McMonigal realised what was actually inside. He was shocked and disgusted at what he saw. 'It's disgusting and feral behaviour,' he said. 'Why would you do something like this?' Bundaberg Regional Council health and regulatory services spokesman Wayne Honor confirmed its animal control department investigated a report of puppies dumped in the Burnett River. 'This is an inexcusable act of animal cruelty which was quite distressing for all council staff involved,' he said. Three weeks ago a person left a female german shepherd dog tied to a tree in bush off the Isis Hwy. The dead dog was found by a Department of Mains Road worker at 1pm on January 9. RSPCA Queensland spokesman Michael Beatty said nothing had come from the investigation so far and described the latest incident as a 'callous act'.","Fisherman finds bag of dead pups after they are washed up on the banks of the Burnett River in Queensland .

"A Saudi woman who worked on a liberal blog with jailed activist Raif Badawi has been freed after almost three months in prison, her daughter has said. Suad al-Shammari was jailed for insulting Islam after co-founding online discussion group the Saudi Liberal Network with Badawi, who was sentenced to ten years jail and 1,000 lashes for his blogging. As outrage mounts on the kingdom over Badawi's sentence, al-Shammari has been released after 90 days at a women's prison in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, her daughter Sarah al-Rimaly said. Scroll down for videos . A female activist who worked with Raif Badawi, pictured, on a liberal blog in Saudi Arabia has been free after spending 90 days in prison for insulting Islam after commenting on Twitter about Islamic religious leaders . Protesters enact a flogging in front of the Saudi embassy in Washington on January 15, 2015 in a protest against Badawi's sentence of 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes . 'She's released now, thanks be to God,' Ms Rimaly told AFP, adding that her mother left jail three days ago after signing a pledge 'to reduce her activities'. Saudi Arabia's new King Salman late on Thursday issued an amnesty for some prisoners, but Miss Rimaly said her mother's release was unconnected to this. She added that she does not think the amnesty will cover Badawi, whose flogging was on Friday postponed for the third week in a row. Badawi's corporal punishment had been set to be dealt out piecemeal each Friday but he has so far endured only one set of 50 lashes. The 31-year-old won support from governments and human rights groups around the world after he was sentenced to the hefty jail time, the lashes and a £177,000 fine. Ensaf Haidar, wife of Saudia Arabian blogger Raif Badawi, pauses while speaking at a news conference in Ottawa, Canada, where she has fled with their three children after her husband's conviction . Al-Shammari, who helped Badawi set up the Saudi Liberal Network, was arrested in late October for insulting Islam after posting comments on Twitter about Islamic religious leaders, Saudi activists said at the time. The charges against Badawi were also brought over criticism of clerics and the Saudi Arabia's notorious religious police, who have been accused of a heavy-handed enforcement of sharia Islamic law. Paris-based watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) described the SLN Internet site as 'an online discussion network whose aim is to encourage political, religious and social debates in Saudi Arabia'. Badawi endured the first 50 lashes of his sentence outside a mosque in Jeddah on January 9, but two subsequent rounds of punishment were posted on medical grounds. It is not clear why the latest round of flogging was postponed, according to Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar, who has since fled to Canada with their three children. Speaking to reporters and lawmakers in Canada, where she has sought asylum with their three children, she said on Thursday that Badawi's health is 'bad and it's getting worse'. Last week, Badawi's spokesman said there was a chance he could have his jail sentence reduced. Dr Elham Manea, who is a professor at the University of Zurich, said the Saudi ambassador in Germany had told a broadcaster of the development. In a posting on her Facebook page, she wrote: 'Saudi ambassador in Germany informed NDR-TV that flogging will not continue and #RaifBadawi maybe not (sic) have to serve the whole time in prison.' Badawi is among more than a dozen 'prisoners of conscience' behind bars for their peaceful activism in Saudi Arabia, according to rights group Amnesty International.","Suad al-Shammari spent 90 days in a women's prison for 'insulting Islam'

"A Florida fishing tournament is drawing criticism after a Hammerhead shark died during its release back into the ocean Friday. From its beginning, the three-day long Blacktip Challenge shark tournament drew criticism from local beachgoers and lifeguards with safety concerns, according to CBS. And now, the tournament has angered animal rights activists. During the catch and release fishing challenge, a Hammerhead shark died, prompting the presence of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, WPTV reports. Scroll down for video . Hammerhead: During the catch and release fishing challenge, a Hammerhead shark (photographed)  died, prompting the presence of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission . Though there were no violations because the shark died during its release, animal rights activists say the tournament is doing more harm than good. 'Any dead animal is attracting sharks to the area as well as any fish that they used for the last three days to attract the sharks to the beach,' Jim Abernethy, shark expert, told WPTV,  'It's going to attract more sharks.' That was the initial concern when fishing began Wednesday at Ocean Reef Park on Singer Island, WPTV reports. There were so many sharks in the area that lifeguards were forced to close the beach to swimmers for six hours. The fishermen in the tournament use bait to draw the sharks near in an effort to catch, photograph, tag, and release them back into the water. Respect: Josh Jorgensen (photographed), who founded the tournament in 2008, that the anglers who participate respect the animals . But, even without the bait, South Florida's coastline typically sees more sharks this time of year than any other because of the Blacktip shark migration. 'Honestly, the sharks are going to be here no matter what...whether we are fishing or otherwise,' Eddie Reese, a fisherman in the competition, told WPTV. Thousands of Blacktip sharks and spinner sharks head south for the winter months, in fact, up to 15,000 sharks were counted off Palm Beach County in one day during 2013's migration, according to the Huffington Post. Challenge: Dozens of competitors took part in the Blacktip challenge which began Wednesday and ended Friday . Migration: Here, hundreds of Blacktip sharks and spinner sharks swim in Florida waters during their annual migration south . Though this may prove to be a nightmare for beachgoers, it's prime fishing season for fishermen. Dozens of competitors took part in the Blacktip Challenge which began Wednesday and ended Friday. The FWC said that the fishermen are not breaking any laws as long as they stay away from guarded swim areas, WPTV reports. The participants -- who must posses a Florida fishing license -- work in teams of up to five people to catch a shark, measure it, photograph it, place a tracking tag on it, and release it, according to the challenge's website. Teams: The participants work in teams of up to five people to catch a shark, measure it, photograph it, place a tracking tag on it, and release it . Opinions: Here, a Facebook user expresses her opinion about the annual tournament . Stay Off: In this Facebook post, one Facebook user tells Blacktip fishermen to 'stay off our public beaches!' Josh Jorgensen, who founded the tournament in 2008, told WPTV that the anglers who participate respect the animals and are sure to release the sharks back into the water quickly. 'I wish people that criticize would just come and see how much these anglers respect the animals, you know, maybe next year,' Jorgensen said. Jorgensen holds that the tournament, while an entertaining sport, contributes to shark research as well, according to the website. Through the challenge, Jorgensen works with both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Apex Predator Cooperative Shark Tagging Program and the International Land-Based Shark Fishing Association. Measurements taken in the catches are used by researchers in estimated weight formulas and the application of tracking tags aids in research as well. The fisherman are prohibited from using chum and gaffs in the tournament and are only permitted to fish on the beach. Prizes in the annual competition include trophies, sponsor prizes, and cash prizes of up to $10,000.","The Blacktip Challenge shark tournament is drawing criticism after a Hammerhead shark died during its release back into the ocean Friday .

"Arrest: Jose Osorio, pictured, was arrested on Friday after witnesses reported he fired multiple shots at two parked cars . A Massachusetts man faces multiple charges after allegedly shooting cars left in parking spots that had been shoveled of snow after the blizzard. Jose Osorio was arrested on Friday after witnesses reported that he fired multiple shots at two parked cars that were in spaces that had been shoveled on a street in Fall River, Massachusetts. Neighbors also overhead him banging on doors and yelling about the cars that were parked in the street shortly before he opened fire. Lt. Ronald Furtado, of the Fall River Police Department told ABC News: 'During the course of the investigation the fact came up that he was observed yelling and banging on doors in the neighborhood about vehicles parked out in the street. He added: 'Additional facts came to light that he had produced a handgun and fired at two of the vehicles.' Furtado  believes that Osorio had shoveled the parking spaces that were then occupied. He added that when officers arrived they found Osorio in the area and later found a handgun at his address. The gunman now faces multiple charges, including carrying a firearm without a license, carrying a firearm after being convicted of a violent crime and discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a dwelling.

"‘You can’t trust people whose cuisine is so bad,’ joked the then French President Jacques Chirac in his infamous put-down of the British with other world leaders. The Gaullist leader generated headlines around the world after being caught ridiculing English gastronomy alongside other world leaders at a summit in 2005. Mr Chirac said: ‘The only thing they have ever done for European agriculture is mad cow disease. After Finland, it is the country with the worst food.’ But 10 years on, exports of the most British of British delicacies – the greasy fry up – are rocketing, according to new figures. Scroll down for video . Exports of the most British of British delicacies – the greasy fry up – are rocketing, according to new figures . British bacon is now being exported around the world - including to Denmark – with exports of sausages, eggs and even black pudding soaring. In 2013 British bacon producers exported over £33million worth of the sandwich staple to nearly 70 countries, with another £1.3million worth of black pudding sold to foreign countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway. British eggs, meanwhile, are worth nearly £88million to the British economy – with exports to 57 countries in 2013. Sales of bakes beans, smoked kippers and British jams are also booming, Government figures show. From 2010 to 2013 exports of baked beans to Saudi Arabia have increased by 46 per cent, while exports of bread have risen by 131 per cent. In 2013 we exported nearly £25m of baked beans to 92 countries. Smoked kipper - the traditional Victorian breakfast - is showing signs of a comeback, with exports to 14 countries last year, bringing in £724,000 to the economy. British bacon is now being exported around the world - including to Denmark – with exports of sausages, eggs and even black pudding soaring . Jam to Jamaica . Overall, the UK sent £94million of jam around the world in 2013, from Japan to Jamaica – with over £8million going to France. Peanut butter to Pakistan . In the last two years we exported £251,000 of peanut butter to Pakistan – with £8.6m exported in 2013. Honey to New Zealand . New Zealand’s Manuka honey may be renowned the world over, but they still want to import our UK natural honey, with a 162% increase in exports to New Zealand from 2010-2013. We exported UK natural honey to 64 countries in 2013, worth £13m. Porridge to the Middle East . The traditional winter breakfast is gaining popularity… in the Middle East, minister said. In 2013 we exported £578,000 to 32 countries, including growing amounts to the United Arab Emirates. Since 2010, 600 new markets for food businesses have been opened up. In 2013 exports of UK food and drink were worth £18.9 billion, an increase of £1.2 billion since 2010. Exports of our fruit and vegetable juices have also rocketed – up almost 40 per cent since 2010 to a total of £65 million in 2013. Apple and orange juice are among our biggest international sellers with £35 million in sales. British juices are now shipped to 96 countries including fruit havens Spain, Italy, Brazil and America. The demand for our fruit and vegetable drinks has soared by almost 40 per cent since 2010 making the UK the fourth biggest juice exporter in the EU. A spokeswoman in the Environment Department claimed ‘the Danes can’t get enough of our streaky bacon’, adding: ‘Our black pudding is enjoyed from Spain to Norway, our eggs are boiled in Brazil and our baked beans are the toast of Saudi Arabia.’ She added: ‘Our natural honey exports to New Zealand have trebled over three years and the Italians are hooked on our kippers.’ Ministers said the figures show Britain is now ‘leading the way in exporting the foods eaten around the world for the most important meal of the day – breakfast’. Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said: ‘Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and no-one does breakfast like the British. ‘Our traditional full English breakfasts are legendary, and people all around the world are buying our top-quality UK produce to make their own fry-ups—from premium pork sausages to quality British eggs.' Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said British breakfasts were 'legendary' She added: ‘From old favourites like porridge oats to more modern products like granola our unique strength lies in the combination of innovation and tradition that makes our food and drink so popular the world over. ‘We’re opening new international markets every week to help a record number of home-grown food and drinks companies sell their delicious produce abroad, providing more jobs and generating millions for our growing economy.’ Food manufacturing is larger than car production and aerospace combined, and one in eight people are employed in the UK food chain. Westaway Sausages . West country sausage producers Westaways produce 250,000 sausages every day, and export them around the world—currently about 5 per cent of their sausages are destined for foreign shores, but this figure is rising every day. This week alone, sausages were sent to Portugal, Malta, Hong Kong, Bermuda and Barbados. Lizi’s Granola . For the health conscious, new and innovative businesses like Lizi’s Granola are selling their low-sugar and low-fat alternatives to the fry-up worldwide. Based in Cardiff, Lizi’s launched ten years ago and now exports to all continents other than South America. Three years ago Lizi’s began exporting to China, where the expanding middle class means healthy eating trends are on the up. Daioni . Daioni—which means ‘goodness’ in Welsh—exports its organic milk and dairy products around the globe, as well as its flavoured milk drinks. Daioni products are all made from organic milk from farms in England and Wales, and are exported to China, Hong Kong, The Middle East and Europe. Last year the business's exports grew by 500 per cent.","Exports of the greasy fry up are rocketing, according to new figures .

"The Yorkshire Ripper is enjoying a cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, it was claimed yesterday. Despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers, Peter Sutcliffe, 68, is allowed visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours. He is said to have money to spend in the psychiatric hospital’s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions. It has been claimed that Sutcliffe is now a Jehovah’s Witness. Scroll down for video . Relaxed: Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe (pictured above) is said to enjoy a relaxed life in Broadmoor with an MP3 player, an X Factor habit, four-hour visits and money from penpals to spend in the hospital's own shop . Sutcliffe, who killed 13 women and tried to murder seven others between 1975 and 1980, has been held at Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire (pictured) for more than 30 years. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia . In the evenings, he watches TV shows such as The X Factor and I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, the Sun on Sunday reported. The mass murderer – who savagely killed 13 women – also has his own MP3 player and can read emails. A new image of a relaxed-looking Sutcliffe – the first for 20 years – supports the easy lifestyle claim. There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard. Sutcliffe has certainly piled on the pounds. One report estimated his weight at 19 or 20 stone. He has type 2 diabetes, but rather than hit the gym to get fit he is said to enjoy chocolate and burgers. Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor for more than three decades after he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed, he tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree. The claims about his lifestyle have angered victims’ families. Roofer Neil Jackson, 56, whose mother Emily was Sutcliffe’s second victim, said: ‘He tore apart our family and this just looks like he’s being rewarded. He’s getting an easy life and he’s clearly enjoying every minute. I hope the lifestyle kills him. ‘It doesn’t matter how many years go by, it doesn’t make the pain of what he did any easier.’ Lifestyle: The high-security hospital houses more than 200 patients, many with severe psychiatric disorders . Corridors: Inside Broadmoor looks like any other hospital, but patients like Sutcliffe are closely monitored . Connections: This photo showed the moment Sutcliffe was introduced to Frank Bruno by disgraced entertainer Jimmy Savile in 1991. Boxer Mr Bruno said he was duped and did not know who he was meeting . Attack: Sutcliffe after he was first assaulted by another inmate in 1983. Several other attacks would follow . Greg Mulholland, a Liberal Democrat MP in Leeds where Sutcliffe attacked a number of women, said: ‘Every time there are reports of Peter Sutcliffe’s life it is hugely distressing to the relatives of his many victims. 'Considering the enormity of his despicable crimes people need to have confidence that his life behind bars is not a soft touch.’ Although Sutcliffe has gone grey, the new photo reveals that he still has his full head of frizzy hair, beard and moustache, familiar dark staring eyes and arrogant smirk. Change: Sutcliffe's apparent weight gain is a far cry from photos which circulated of him in the 1980s . He is smartly dressed in a pink shirt and patterned red tie. The picture is said to have been taken in a playroom normally used for the children of people visiting the high-security institution in Berkshire. Sutcliffe posed for it with an unidentified visitor and was watched closely by guards in the room. When shown the photo he is said to have commented: ‘Oh God, I look so old.’ It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell. Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected. In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. His health has deteriorated in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and later suffered from a debilitating cough. Medication has made him put on weight and has increased his blood pressure. Two months ago he suffered an attack of angina. He has reportedly been banned from eating fried breakfasts and must have cereal instead. Sutcliffe used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England. He believed he was on a ‘mission from God’ to kill sex workers. Victims: Jacqueline Hill, 20, from Leeds (left) and Yvonne Pearson, 20, from Bradford (right) were both killed .","Report claims 13-time murderer has several penpals at psychiatric unit .

"San Francisco police arrested a man on suspicion of murder Saturday in connection with a suitcase found on a downtown street stuffed with dismembered human remains. Mark Andrus, 59, had been spotted on surveillance footage near where the suitcase was discovered and was booked into county jail hours after he was detained as a 'person of interest,' Officer Grace Gatpandan said. The bag was discovered Wednesday in the city's SOMA neighborhood and contained a male's body's parts, though not his head or hands. Scroll down for video... Grisly: Mark Andrus was seen in news footage Friday covered in a bed sheet as he was led away by San Francisco street following an arrest on charges he murdered a man then stuffed his dismembered body into a suitcase . Pictured: Gatpandan said she could not comment on exactly how police linked Andrus to the body, but said they were aided by the surveillance footage and witness statements . Police said other body parts were found in a nearby trash can. Gatpandan said she could not comment on exactly how police linked Andrus to the body, but said they were aided by the surveillance footage and witness statements. She did not have any additional information about Andrus, the body parts found in the suitcase or a possible motive. According to WPTV, police acted on an anonymous tip. Andrus' family told the San Francisco Chronicle he had run-ins with the law, kept to himself and drifted so far from them that they didn't know where he was or how to reach him. 'We haven't heard from him in, oh my gosh, years and years and years,' said Helen Andrus of Spokane, Wash., who is married to Mark Andrus' older brother, Jon. Horrific: Police in San Francisco last week found body parts in a suitcase and a trash can in the city's SOMA neighborhood . 'My husband at one point tried to reach out and find him, but I'm guessing it's been 20 years now since we last saw him.' The newspaper said Andrus had arrests in Missoula, Montana, in the 1980s and '90s for suspected drug possession, theft, burglary and jumping bail. Police received a call on Friday night on the department's anonymous tip line that a 'person of interest' in the suitcase incident had been spotted in the city's Tenderloin neighborhood, Gatpandan said. They responded and detained two people, including Andrus. Police had released photos of Andrus from the surveillance footage earlier in the day showing him in a striped baseball cap, light blue jeans and a blue and orange jacket. Video evidence: Homicide detectives were on the scene and trying to recover surveillance footage from nearby businesses . The suitcase was found Wednesday afternoon outside a Goodwill thrift store in the city's South of Market neighborhood. More body parts were found in a trash can nearby. The San Francisco medical examiner determined that the remains belong to an unidentified light-skinned man. Authorities will now turn to a DNA laboratory to identify him. The condition of the man's torso had police considering the possibility that organized crime or a gang was responsible for the remains, Officer Albie Esparza told the Chronicle before the announcement of Saturday's arrest. He did not elaborate in the story. Gatpandan said she did not know whether the second person who was detained remained in custody Saturday.

"Shocking figures: The annual number of sex offenders under the age of ten has doubled in the last three years. A four-year child was investigated by police for rape while 800 youngster under the age of ten have sexually assaulted other children in the last six years. The shocking revelations are a terrifying insight into the child abuse crisis plaguing Britain - with experts blaming internet porn and the sexualisation of children for the rise in offences. The figures, obtained by The Sunday Mirror, also show that the annual number of sex offenders under the age of ten has doubled in the last three years. Child protection experts believe the majority of the youngsters will have been abuse victims themselves. But they are also deeply concerned about the accessibility of extreme online pornography and the effect this can have on children who watch it. Their comment comes two years after David Cameron vowed to ensure pornography is blocked by internet providers on demand from the householder. Figures obtained by the Sunday Mirror through a Freedom of Information (FoI) request from 33 police forces across England and Wales showed 776 children aged up to nine had been investigated for sex crimes. No legal action was taken over the incidents as the criminal age of responsibility in England and Wales is 10. NSPCC spokesman Jon Brown told the Sunday Mirror: 'These figures may seem hard to believe but, unfortunately, there are cases of children as young as three committing sexual offences. 'These children may well have experienced very severe trauma and abuse themselves. That kind of behaviour won't just have come out of nowhere. They will undoubtedly have been victims of sexual abuse. It's terrible. 'There should be no cases like this. These children are not paedophiles - they are victims themselves.' Shocking data released by the Metropolitan Police appears to show a four year old was recorded as suspected of committing rape between January and September 2014. Scotland Yard refused to disclose if the child was a boy or girl. And officers from Greater Manchester Police dealt with 18 horrific cases of children under 10 raping other children between 2009 and 2014. Disturbing: In one shocking case revealed through a Freedom of Information request, a nine-year-old girl was quizzed for taking or making ­indecent photos of other children . The offenders included a boy aged six, five boys aged seven, seven boys aged eight and five boys aged nine. Dozens more children under ten were found to have committed sexual assaults in Greater Manchester, including a seven-year-old girl who sexually assaulted a boy. A leading psychologist has claimed not enough is being done to prevent youngsters from watching porn on the internet. Dr Linda Papadopoulos wrote a report for the Home Office in 2010 discussing ways in which children could be protected from exposure to x-rated images. Only a tiny portion of her 36 recommendations were implemented, including the introduction of new age ratings for music videos. Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, she claimed the Government needed to do much more to tackle the problem. A nine-year-old girl was quizzed for taking or making ­indecent photos of other children. Rape by children at such a young age constitutes penetration of their victim other than sexual intercourse. The paper said the number of children committing sex crimes had doubled from 128 in 2012 to 254 last year and the figures could be higher as several forces did not respond to its FoI request. Figures from the Met suggest they recorded a total of 2,823 crimes of all types perpetrated by one to 10 year olds between 2011 and 2014. But the force warned there were errors in the recording of some its data, citing a rape suspect's age being entered as one and many other ages simply recorded as zero because the suspect's age was unknown to the officer entering the data. Against this, Donald Findlater, research director at the Lucy Faithfull ­Foundation, warned the statistics were more likely to be the tip of the iceberg as many of the crimes go unreported. He claimed it was 'tragic' when children as young as three display sexualised behaviour and said there was a lack of services available for such youngsters. Warning: Psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos, above, has claimed not enough is being done to prevent youngsters from watching porn on the internet . The Lucy Faithfull Foundation has produced a guide for parents, teachers and playgroup leaders focusing on children who display sexual behaviour. Calls and emails to its Stop it Now! helpline have more than doubled since 2004, rising from 110 to 225 last year. The charity even discussed the sexual behaviour of a two-year-old boy with a concerned caller. A Government spokesman said: 'The age of criminal responsibility is set at 10 years old. Social services work with the families of children under this age whose behaviour gives cause for concern. 'If a child is found to have committed a serious offence, councils can apply to the Family Court to place the child under supervision, or take them into care. 'They could also be placed under the supervision of a youth offending team for up to 12 months.'

"Australian journalist Peter Greste has been released from Egyptian prison and is on his way back to Australia after more than a year behind bars. Mr Greste was freed by order of Egypt's president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, under a new law that allows foreign prisoners to be deported. His brother Andrew Greste confirmed the Al-Jazeera reporter 'has left Egyptian airspace' and will arrive home in Brisbane on Monday. His overjoyed sibling wrote on Twitter: 'Hard to believe but YES @PeterGreste is a free man. His butt has left Egyptian airspace yippeeeeee!!!!! Think I'll go and get drunk :):):).' Mr Greste arrived in Larnaca, Cyprus, on Sunday night after flying out of Cairo on an EgyptAir flight alongside one of his brothers. The family was ecstatic and called for the world to respect his brother's privacy and to give him time to appreciate his freedom. A Canadian journalist also being held in Egypt will also be released 'within days', security officials have revealed. Al Jazeera journalist Peter Greste stands inside the defendants' cage in a courtroom during his trial on terror charge in Cairo, Egypt . Baher Mohamed (left) Canadian-Egyptian acting Cairo bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy (centre), and Mr Greste (right) appear in court . Mr Greste's Canadian-Egyptian colleague Mohamed Fahmy is set to be released after officials negotiated for him to be deported to North America. The pair were jailed for at least seven years alongside Baher Mohamed for fabricating the news, despite no evidence of this ever being shown to a court. The officials who confirmed his release spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media. Sunday marked the 400th day since Mr Greste's arrest and imprisonment, along with his two colleagues. The trio were convicted of fabricating news footage on behalf of the Muslim Brotherhood of ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, despite no evidence being produced. Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Mr Greste is desperate to return to Australia. 'I spoke to Peter Greste shortly after his release and before he departed Egypt,' she told reporters in Sydney on Monday. 'He was immensely relieved and he was desperate to come home to Australia and reunite with his family.' Ms Bishop confirmed he was now in Cyprus and had been met by Australian consular officials. 'From my discussion with him, he was very keen to be back on a beach and lying in the sun in Australia,' she said. His brother Andrew Greste confirmed the Al-Jazeera reporter 'has left Egyptian airspace' The overjoyed sibling sent a message of thanks to all of their support in fighting for Greste's release . Events moved very quickly overnight with the minister saying Greste was given short notice he would be released 'unconditionally'. 'We moved as fast as we could to make arrangements for his immediate departure,' Ms Bishop said. 'He will make his way home in his own time. 'He wants a bit of rest and recreation and to be re-united with friends and family as soon as possible.' Ms Bishop said Greste had gone through a long ordeal and she was relieved and delighted he was finally on his way home. 'Australia has been at the forefront of calling for his release,' she said. 'We have worked very hard behind the scenes, working directly with the Egyptian government.' Ms Bishop also thanked a number of other governments around the world who had supported his cause and, at Australia's request, made representations on his behalf to the Egyptian government. 'I personally spoke with the foreign minister in Egypt and made a number of representations, oral and in writing, and spoke to President al-Sisi,' she said. Mr Greste's Canadian-Egyptian colleague Mohamed Fahmy is also set to be released . 'I particularly mention the government of Latvia, given Peter's family background - the Latvian government were also of great assistance.' Ms Bishop also paid tribute to the role of consular staff in his release, noting that Greste had thanked the Australian government, the public and journalists who has rallied to his cause. 'He told me that it had sustained him through the very long time that he spent in jail.' A statement from Al Jazeera welcomed the news that Mr Greste had been freed, but said it would continue to fight for his colleagues' release. 'We're pleased for Peter and his family that they are to be reunited. It has been an incredible and unjustifiable ordeal for them, and they have coped with incredible dignity,' the statement said. 'Peter's integrity is not just intact, but has been further enhanced by the fortitude and sacrifice he has shown for his profession of informing the public. 'We will not rest until Baher and Mohamed also regain their freedom. The Egyptian authorities have it in their power to finish this properly today, and that is exactly what they must do.' Earlier this month Egypt's Court of Cassation ordered a retrial of Mr Greste and his colleagues. At the time, his family said they were pinning hopes for their son's freedom on his chances of being deported before a second trial. Mr Greste (centre) manages to smile during his trial in Cairo . Andrew (right), Lois (centre) and Juris Greste, parents and brother of Australian journalist Peter Greste, are pinning hopes for their son's freedom on his chances of being deported before a second trial . Greste, Egyptian-Canadian Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Mohammed Baher were sentenced to at least seven years in prison on terrorism-related charges last year in a trial described as a sham by rights groups. There was no immediate word on the other two journalists. The three were arrested over their coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in 2013. Egyptian authorities accused them of providing a platform for Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, now declared a terrorist organization. Rights groups and several media outlets condemned the verdicts as political, saying the three were doing their job during a tumultuous time. According to a law passed late last year, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has the power to deport foreign defendants or convicts if it's considered to be in the interest of national security. The law was seen as providing a potential legal instrument with which to free the journalists. El-Sissi had repeatedly said he wants to end the case, which has prompted a storm of international criticism.","Al-Jazeera reported Peter Greste released and deported from Egypt .

"She provoked outrage when she had her breasts enlarged on the NHS because her flat chest upset her. Now aspiring glamour model Josie Cunningham is risking the wrath of taxpayers yet again for taking council-funded taxi trips worth nearly £6,000 a year – because she says she is too scared to take the bus. The 24-year-old claims she is so hated following publicity about her breast operation that she cannot use public transport to take her two young children to and from school. Mother: Josie Cunningham infamously had her 32A breasts enlarged to a 36DD with taxpayers' money . She told her GP that the stress was giving her anxiety attacks and that her children, aged six and three, were missing school and nursery as a result. Leeds City Council has reportedly now accepted an application for free school taxi trips on health grounds. It means Miss Cunningham, a single mother who is five months pregnant, is receiving around £150 of free fares a week – the equivalent of £5,700 per school year. Comparing herself to former glamour model Katie Price, she  said: ‘You wouldn’t see Katie Price get a bus — and I’m much more hated than her. ‘Why should I foot the bill when it’s the public who cause me so much discomfort? They can pay for it. I couldn’t get a bus again. I’m too well recognised and the amount of hate I receive makes it impossible to get public transport.’ Scroll down for video . Before and after: Her breast enlargement operation came after she was recommended for funding by her GP . And, in a brazen interview with the . Sun, she added: ‘Taxpayers should be grateful it’s only taxi fares and . not private hire cars.’ Yesterday she refused to comment further and . referred all questions to her agent. Miss . Cunningham shot to notoriety last year when she had a £4,800 operation . to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been . bullied since she was 14 for having a  flat chest. Her operation was . carried out by the same NHS trust that had refused to fund surgery that . would have enabled a two-year-old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to . walk. Miss Cunningham later claimed her breasts were ‘so big’ she found them embarrassing and said the NHS should pay for a reduction. Then she tried to placate public opinion by promising to pay back the cash. But . when she became pregnant after working as a £1,000-a-night escort, she . admitted she cannot uphold her pledge – and now continues to be a drain . on public funds. Indeed two months ago she boasted she would be having £2,500 of free dental work now she is expecting. Since . last month, Miss Cunningham and her children have been driven . two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school, twice a day. The . journey would cost around £30 a week by bus. Accepted: Leeds City Council chiefs (based at Leeds Civic Hall, pictured) have granted Miss Cunningham's request to take her children to and from school every day by taxi - costing £150 a week . This year Leeds council is having to make savings of £50million from its budget. A . spokesman said: ‘We are not able to comment on individual cases. However, the council takes matters relating to attendance at school . extremely seriously.’ Miss Cunningham’s neighbours were not impressed. A . father of four, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It seems like . she’s doing it to annoy people. Thousands of pounds are being wasted and . there are people out there who need it. ‘She’s . just money grabbing and gives genuine claimants a bad name. Parents are . struggling to put food on the table and she gets the school run for . free in a comfortable taxi.’ A . young mother said: ‘I see the taxis come and go. They are nice black . and white taxis as well. It’s ridiculous. No one gets special treatment . like her and she doesn’t care. She loves the attention.’ Yesterday hundreds of readers posted messages on Mail Online to condemn Miss Cunningham – and Leeds council for funding her. One . reader said: ‘Make her walk! It’s just outrageous  that she is still . fleecing the taxpayers and has no regrets,’ while another wrote: ‘Sack . the person who okayed paying for this  taxi service.’","Josie Cunningham infamously had 32A breasts enlarged to 36DD on NHS .

"A teenager battling cancer with just days to live has fulfilled his last wish by taking his girlfriend to his school prom. Jak Trueman was applauded by tearful classmates at the event, organised at the last minute, after doctors told him he was dying. More than 200 teachers and pupils from West Calder High, West Lothian, Scotland, watched the 15-year-old keep his promise to take girlfriend Hannah Boyd, 14, to the prom. The young couple have been going out for almost two years. Scroll down for video . Jak Trueman, pictured at prom with girlfriend Hannah, was applauded by tearful classmates at the event, organised at the last minute, after doctors told him he was dying. And it was the youngster's dying wish to accompany her to their last school event together at Livingston Football Club near his home in Mid Calder, West Lothian. The teenager had to receive much-needed pain relief to make the prom after he deteriorated on Thursday and his family feared he wouldn't survive the night. His mother Alison revealed they were living 'minute by minute, hour by hour' desperate for him to improve. Jak has terminal T-Cell Lymphoma, which was diagnosed in August last year. He was in line to take more treatment until scans showed early last week the cancer had spread throughout his body. 'We will just take it minute by minute hour by hour,' she said. 'The prom was about my boy and Hannah. 'He managed to make the evening for 10 minutes through wonderful courage and determination.' She added: 'Jak and Hannah are exceptionally close and I think it is absolutely magical that the school brought the prom forward, what they have done this for both of them . 'It is overwhelming what the school has arranged.' The youngster's dying wish to accompany Hannha, who he has been dating for almost two years, to their last school event together . Jak vowed to dedicate what time he has left to raising cash for Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research charity. Thanks to hundreds of supporters worldwide, he has raised more than £33,000 in less than a week. 'A phenomenal amount for my phenomenal boy - making things a little easier knowing others will benefit,' Mrs Trueman added. He hopes to raise enough cash to set up the charity 'Team Jak' which will offer additional support for youngsters battling cancer. The young goalie will also have his name chanted by thousands of football fans at the Scottish League Cup semi-final between Celtic and Rangers today at the Hampden ground in Glasgow . A call-out went viral on fans' websites yesterday. Jak, a Rangers fan, was desperate to attend the game but family fear he is now too ill to make the journey. Jak has terminal T-Cell Lymphoma, which was diagnosed last August last year and he has since vowed to use his remaining time to raise money for a cancer charity . Breaking the news to his friends, he wrote: 'Well, that's it. 'Worse case scenario has happened. I have been preparing myself for this answer all day although it still came hard to take. 'My very experienced Doctors and Professors have looked at the PET scan from today and the disease has spread into all my bones and organs. 'They have decided not to go any further with any more treatment.' He added that he has not been told how long he has left. 'I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it. 'I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past 6 months, they have tried their best for me.' Jak, who is a goalie with Mid Calder Colts Under-16s, is desperate to be well enough to attend the Old Firm cup clash at Hampden today. Fans yesterday paid tribute to the youngster with a standing round of applause.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott should take a page out of his arch-nemesis Kevin Rudd's book by getting on social media and mingling more with the community. That's the suggestion of the owner of the country pub Mr Abbott dropped in on last week, after the nation's leader was told he needs to get away from his 'latte-sipping' advisers and put his policies to the 'pub test'. Mr Abbott chugged a couple of beers at the Union Club Hotel in Colac for around 40 minutes last Friday and today hailed his visit to the pub as a 'thrill' in a 'make or break' speech today. Publican Warwick Newman said it was 'great' to have the Prime Minister drop in and buy punters drinks. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott is pictured with local MP Sarah Henderson pouring local 'Jimmy' a glass of beer at the Union Club Hotel in Colac . Mr Abbott said it was a 'thrill' to visit the pub in Colac - although locals advised he should head out of the office more and press the flesh as Kevin Rudd does . Mr Abbott today announced he was ditching his paid parental leave scheme and pledged not to raise the GST without a political consensus . 'He was great,' said Mr Newman. 'He was very, very accommodating. 'He had a lot of selfies. He just had a few beers.' 'No one was hitting him up with the hard questions,' he said, and there wasn't any curly questions about his knighting of Prince Philip. But Mr Newman said it wouldn't hurt for Mr Abbott to take some inspiration from his predecessor, Mr Rudd. 'I think as the prime minister of the country a lot of your day is orchestrated - people are expecting you, you're opening something. 'To go and do something totally like, ""I'm in the car, let's go to the pub"", I guess it was probably a little bit different for him because people weren't expecting it of him. I think it's something he hasn't done. 'They could probably learn a bit off someone like Kevin Rudd - voted in by young people based on social media and his presence in the community, in that respect. 'Tony Abbott's probably a little more straight down the line. It's probably not going to hurt.' Former prime minister Kevin Rudd often went on walks through Queen St Mall in Brisbane, hosted community cabinets and was very popular on social media . 'They could probably learn a bit off someone like Kevin Rudd - voted in by young people based on social media and his presence in the community, in that respect,' Mr Newman said . Colac, a town of around 10,000, is located in the federal seat of Corangimite. It was a Labor seat prior to the 2013 federal election, when  Liberal MP Sarah Henderson swept previous member Darren Cheeseman from power. Reflecting on Mr Abbott's recent decisions, Mr Newman said he thought Prince Philip was deserving of the knighthood, based on his record. But he still had a dose of real talk for the PM. 'He's done a lot for Australia. There' s a lot of facts behind it. 'Whether it's a slap in the face to someone like Dawn Fraser, who knows.' 'He's deserving, yes. Should he have been given it? Probably not.' National Party MP Michael McCormack last week urged Mr Abbott to visit the Royal Hotel in Grong Grong, west of Wagga Wagga NSW, to get an 'honest appraisal' of how the government could improve. In an interview with Fairfax Media, Mr McCormack said Mr Abbott needed to get away from the 'texting, latte-sipping, keyboard warriors who frequent the tapas bars of Sydney and Melbourne'. Mr Abbott today said he had been 'warmly' welcomed at the Colac pub.

"A California woman who started a program to teach hunting and other outdoor pursuits to children has begun receiving death threats from animal-rights activists. Jen Cordaro, who calls herself 'Jen the Archer' on her Facebook page, started a program two months ago called #BringAKidHunting, which claims to teach children responsible hunting habits. Cordaro's Facebook page, which includes photos of her and her young students in the field, has caught the attention of animal-rights activists, who want to stop all hunting in California. Scroll down for video . Jen Cordaro, who calls herself 'Jen the Archer', started a program several months ago to teach hunting and other outdoor pursuits to children that has attracted the anger of animal-rights activists in California . Cordaro's Facebook page, which includes photos of her and her young students in the field, has caught the attention of animal-rights activists, who want to stop all hunting in California . The hunting and angling enthusiast has received dozens of messages including: 'I would not let my children near such a vile, sadistic murderer as this piece of human trash.' Another post said: 'Give me 5 minutes in a room with her and I would make sure she feels the same pain and cruelty she dished out!' As well as angry comments on her social media pages, an online petition has been launched which calls Cordaro a murderer and demands that she stop hunting. The Change.org petition accuses Cordaro of teaching children to become animal murderers. 'Cordaro claims to be someone who promotes wildlife conservation and all she does is kill innocent animals and post them on social media for the world to join her in celebrating murder,' writes Dusti Lee, who launched the petition on Wednesday. 'She brainwashes children into believing that murdering animals is a positive activity in the world and then helps them brag about their kills by turning to social media for the accolades of trophy pictures,' he writes. 'She brainwashes children into believing that murdering animals is a positive activity' claims Dusti Lee who has launched a petition calling for her to stop . The petition has so far received over 2000 signatures. Cordaro told KNSD that the threats have made her uncomfortable. 'It's a little intimidating, I'm not going to lie. It's a little scary,' she said. She has also received support as well, including one post that read: 'Keep it up and silence the haters.' Parents of children she has taught have also come forward to offer her support. Shannon Caldwell told 10News that her daughter MacKenzie had a wonderful experience. 'Not only hunting, they took her to an archery range, to lobster hooping, to learn how to shoot a gun; just all around fun. Kept her outdoors, she never touched her phone or other electronics around. It was overall one of the best weekends. She said it was like Christmas every day,' she said. Ironically Cordaro used to be a vegetarian, but she says the local, sustainable food movement got her interested in harvesting her own meat.

'Being the eaters, I think its important to be responsible meat eaters. Hunting is, in my opinion, the most responsible way for me to go and acquire meat,' she told XETV. Despite the online abuse, she hasn't contacted police about the threats and hopes things will die down. 'I'm not going to run. I'm right here and I'm going to stay here and advocate for outdoors and hunters and for kids in the outdoors.

"Two elderly cousins who lived together for 40 years have killed themselves because they feared being sent to separate nursing homes, it was revealed yesterday. Frail Stuart Henderson, 86, and Phyllis McConachie, 89, paid around £6,500 each to die together at a Swiss clinic. Mr Henderson, who was virtually blind, and Miss McConachie, who was almost deaf and had suffered several strokes, lived at a sheltered housing complex in Troon, Ayrshire. The complex in Troon, Ayrshire, where cousins Stuart Henderson and Phyllis McConachie had been living . After both suffered falls, they were convinced social services would intervene if their health deteriorated further. Campaigners who helped them to contact the Swiss assisted dying group Eternal Spirit said they were ‘completely interdependent’ and had threatened to jump from a nine-storey building together if they could not reach Switzerland. Workers from the foundation helped them travel to an apartment owned by Eternal Spirit in Basel. There, they were assessed by two doctors who sanctioned their death. After receiving lethal doses of medication, they kissed each other goodbye and died hand-in-hand on November 10 last year, according to Eternal Spirit’s president Dr Erika Preisig. She said the pair, who had few surviving relatives, kept their plans secret: ‘They were very, very afraid someone would find out and stop them. 'Their biggest wish was that they should be allowed to die together and not to live apart. They told me they hoped the law would change in Britain to allow them to have an assisted voluntary death at home, but that they could not wait because they were so afraid they would be separated. ‘Mr Henderson had fallen recently and I’m sure his hand was broken but he refused to see a doctor because of that fear. They were both very sure they wanted to die.’ The cousins made contact with Eternal Spirit in July last year and submitted medical reports and personal letters explaining why they wanted to die. Neither Mr Henderson, a retired mechanical engineer, nor former council secretary Miss McConachie had a terminal illness. The late MSP Margo McDonald, who introduced the Assisted Suicide (Scotland) Bill. It is currently being scrutinised by the Scottish government . Their medical reports were examined by two Swiss doctors and the foundation’s ethical board before Dr Preisig met the cousins at their home in August to assess if either was being pressured into a suicide pact by the other. She said: ‘They were very, very ill and very old but both were very sure they wanted to end their lives together, after having lived together for so long. It was very difficult for them to make the journey to our apartment and it was distressing for them – they found it cruel that they had to travel – but once they were in Switzerland they were relaxed and full of joy.’ In Scotland, the Assisted Suicide (Scotland) Bill, introduced by the late Margo MacDonald is being scrutinised at Holyrood. Since her death last year following a long battle with Parkinson’s disease, the Bill has been championed by Green MSP Patrick Harvie. If the proposed legislation became law, seriously ill people over the age of 16 would be able to request help from a GP to hasten their death. Dr Peter Saunders, campaign director of Care Not Killing, called the cousins’ case ‘a great tragedy’. ‘This tragic case strongly underlines the need for comprehensive and affordable patient-centred care in which people’s social and spiritual needs and not just physical needs are provided for,’ he said. ‘Failure to provide this support, particularly if accompanied by a change in the law to allow assisted suicide, will have the effect of steering more vulnerable elderly people towards taking their lives.’","Stuart Henderson and Phyllis McConachie died together at a Swiss clinic .

"Two Catholic bishops yesterday condemned the BBC drama Wolf Hall as inaccurate and ‘perverse’. They claimed it painted a twisted picture of Thomas More, one of English Catholicism’s most revered saints. The historical series – based on the books of Hilary Mantel – has drawn rave reviews but has baffled some viewers with its complicated plot. The Right Reverend Mark Davies, Bishop of Shrewsbury, and The Right Reverend Mark O’Toole, the Bishop of Plymouth, have claimed BBC drama Wolf Hall has painted a twisted picture of Thomas More (pictured) The second episode, which was broadcast on BBC2 last Wednesday, drew an audience of 2.9million compared with 3.9million for the series opener. The Right Reverend Mark Davies, Bishop of Shrewsbury, disputed the way the leading characters – More and his nemesis Thomas Cromwell – were portrayed. He said: ‘It is an extraordinary and perverse achievement of Hilary Mantel and BBC Drama to make of Thomas Cromwell a flawed hero and of St Thomas More, one of the greatest Englishmen, a scheming villain. ‘It is not necessary to share Thomas More’s faith to recognise his heroism – a man of his own time who remains an example of integrity for all times.’ He said it would be sad if Cromwell was held up as a hero for later generations, adding: ‘We should remember Wolf Hall is a work of fiction.’ The Right Reverend Mark O’Toole, the Bishop of Plymouth, said there was a strong anti-Catholic thread in the series, which stars Shakespearean actor Mark Rylance as Cromwell, Anton Lesser as More, and Damian Lewis as Henry VIII. Bishop O’Toole, who is a lifelong admirer of More, accused Dame Hilary and the BBC of connecting More and his Catholic faith to modern religious fundamentalism. ‘Those modern parallels need to be cautiously drawn,’ said Bishop O’Toole. ‘Hilary Mantel does have this view that being a Catholic is destructive to your humanity. ‘It is not historically accurate and it is not accurate in what the Catholic faith has to contribute to society and to the common good. ‘There is an anti-Catholic thread there, there is no doubt about it. Wolf Hall is not neutral.’ One of Rt Rev O’Toole’s first acts when he was ordained Bishop of Plymouth last year was to visit Buckfast Abbey in Devon to pray at More’s hair shirt, which is kept by Benedictine monks there. ‘Did More make mistakes?’ the bishop asked. ‘Yes. Does it mean he is not a saint? No. Mainstream histories seem to recognise that. Wolf Hall is not presenting Thomas Cromwell through a neutral perspective. There is an anti-Catholic element. ‘It is hard for me to say that Cromwell was driven by principles instead of by darker motives.’ Thomas Cromwell, played by actor Mark Rylance . Thomas More . Thomas More became Henry VIII’s powerful Lord Chancellor when Cardinal Wolsey was thrown out of office for failing to persuade the Pope to grant the king a divorce. More was known for having held Protestant heretics prisoner in his own home, and is said to have enthusiastically supported the punishment of six men burned at the stake for heresy while he was in office. He fell out of favour when Henry decided to achieve his divorce by taking control of the church in England. More was arrested for treason and held in the Tower of London when he refused to swear an oath to confirm Henry’s break with Rome. An opponent of the Reformation, he also refused to accept the annulment of Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon. He was beheaded on July 6, 1535, at the age of 57. Catholics regard More as a martyr and he was beatified in 1886. In 2000, he became patron saint of statesmen and politicians. Thomas Cromwell . The son of a Putney brewer and blacksmith, Thomas Cromwell (played by Mark Rylance) ran away to the Continent as a youth, learning the arts of war, trade and diplomacy. On returning to London he trained as a lawyer and rose to become a key adviser to Wolsey and later the favourite fixer of Henry VIII. He was instrumental in arranging the execution of More and later that of Anne Boleyn. And he was a central figure in the dissolution of the monasteries. But Cromwell fell from favour in 1540 after arranging the disastrous marriage between Henry and Anne of Cleves. Religious conservatives also persuaded the king that Cromwell’s reforms had gone too far. He was beheaded on July 28, 1540, aged 54 or 55.","Catholic bishops condemned BBC's Wolf Hall as inaccurate and ‘perverse’

"Tesco protest: Emma Thompson wants the supermarket to stay away . What are the biggest threats facing London today? Its soaring house prices? The continually expanding national debt? Extreme Islamist terrorists? Apparently not, according to Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson. For her, the most urgent problem is the terrifying ogre of another source of fresh, reasonably priced food. She is campaigning to stop a new Tesco Express opening in Belsize Park, a charming neighbourhood near Hampstead Heath in North London, the heart of luvvie-dom and home of Left-leaning millionaires for half a century. ‘Belsize is a villagey area. It has no need of a Tesco and its very nature will be threatened,’ Thompson said in an open letter to Tesco. ‘The people who live there do not want it. They already have food shops, ones they trust and that retain a local feel to them. Wherever Tesco goes, the local feeling is destroyed by staff who neither know nor care to know the inhabitants.’ Thompson doesn’t actually live in Belsize Park — she lives in West Hampstead, two miles away from the proposed shop on Haverstock Hill. Still, why should that stop an actress with an inflated sense of self-worth telling genuine locals where they should do their shopping? She isn’t the only one. Other actors to sign a 2,900-strong petition to stop the shop opening in a former bank include Dame Janet Suzman and James Corden. ‘This idea of plonking chain-store locals into village High Streets, I think, is damaging,’ said the Shakespearean actress at a local meeting to discuss the new shop. ‘What it does is put a kind of unwanted marker down in our manor.’ Leading the protest is another actor, Tom Conti, who says independent shops are the lifeblood of the area. A photograph of Conti’s face greets you at the tills of nearby supermarket rival Budgens, also on Haverstock Hill. Next to his picture is the printed slogan: ‘WE DONT [sic] NEED, WE DONT [sic] WANT TESCO.’ Conti, best known for his roles in the 1989 film Shirley Valentine and as Miranda’s father in the BBC TV sitcom Miranda, is a one-man protest band in North London. In recent years he has also fought a housing development in nearby Kentish Town. I’ve lived in millionaire luvvieland all my life — first in my parents’ house in Islington, North London, and now in Kentish Town, a mile away from the proposed Tesco. And I’d be delighted if a new Tesco store opens. In fact, I’m delighted every time a cheap, reliable shop selling useful things, such as food and drink, opens. Conversely, my heart sinks when shops offering overpriced organic food and pointless knick-knacks start up. Celebrity protests against cheap food outlets are nothing new. I can remember the ‘Battle of McDonald’s’ that raged through the Georgian High Street of nearby Hampstead in the Eighties. For 12 years, from 1980 to 1992, the fast-food chain fought to open an outlet there, opposed by local activists who launched a ‘Burger off!’ campaign. Among them were Tom Conti, of course, and the novelist Margaret Drabble. ‘My loathing of McDonald’s is intense,’ Drabble said at the time. ‘There are advantages in development, provided it is the right sort, but there are already too many takeaway restaurants in Hampstead.’ Leading the protest is another actor, Tom Conti (left) while comedian James Corden (right) is among celebrities to sign a petition against the store's construction . That campaign was led by the now-deceased Peggy Jay, a Labour councillor and the mother of Peter Jay (the broadcaster and son-in-law of Labour PM Jim Callaghan). You might have thought Labour supporters would be keen on food that is popular with less privileged voters. Not, though, when it’s being sold on their own doorstep. When McDonald’s finally triumphed — after a battle in which the local council spent £25,000 of taxpayers’ money and which ended up in the High Court — a condition was that the restaurant had to be a middle class-friendly outlet. So it was given a discreet facade and classical music was played inside. The only other time McDonald’s faced such opposition was in Martha’s Vineyard, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts — America’s equivalent of Hampstead luvvieland. There, the chain failed to open an outlet thanks to heavyweight objection from gilt-edged Nimbys including singer Carly Simon and actress Mia Farrow. What must make the Tesco row even more infuriating for objectors is that the alternative plan for the site, which Tesco saw off, was a bid for a new restaurant from Nigel Platts-Martin, who owns five restaurants, including The Ledbury, a two-Michelin-starred establishment in even ritzier Notting Hill. Now you see what the Leftie protesters are really after — upmarket, super-priced food. ‘What do we want? Lobster, tomato butter and basil, like at the Ledbury! When do we want it? After a first course of scallops, shaved kohlrabi [fancy cabbage], seaweed oil and frozen horseradish!’ A four-course lunch at The Ledbury, without wine or service, costs £80 — nothing for a multi-millionaire actress. For many Londoners, though, that’s a day’s wages. But ordinary people don’t get a word in edgeways when they are drowned out by celebrities, who also don’t seem to care that Tesco is offering to provide 20 new jobs. ‘What on earth has it got to do with Emma Thompson?’ says Mark Bostridge, a writer who lives near the proposed shop. ‘She is a colossal busybody.’ The site of the proposed new Tesco store on Haverstock Hill, Belsize Park, London. Objected to by Emma Thompson and other celebrities . ‘Residents — many of whom live on limited budgets — are currently paying over and above what they could pay,’ said local Joseph Zarfaty in a letter to the local paper. To be fair, about half the residents I talked to shared Emma Thompson’s views. For example, Neville Lewis, a retired barrister, said the Budgens was adequate. ‘There’s a fair range and it’s a pleasant place to shop. Another Tesco will impact on local grocery shops.’ Meanwhile, there’s another celeb protest brewing in this neck of the woods — against the mansion tax. This, too, is surrounded by a whiff of Left-wing hypocrisy. The tax, which Labour says it would immediately introduce on houses worth more than £2 million if it wins the General Election in May, could mean people living in such homes having to pay, on average, an extra £23,595 a year. Boy, oh boy! The traditionally Labour-supporting bigwigs in this neck of the woods — normally so keen on tax rises and punishing the rich — are dead against it. Most of them live in £2 million-plus houses. This month Lord Mandelson, the Labour politician who lives in a house thought to be worth £8 million, attacked the tax, as have Labour peers Melvyn Bragg, who lives in a multi-million-pound home in Hampstead, and fertility doctor Professor Robert Winston. Critics claim a branch of Tesco will have a damaging effect on local shops in the area (pictured above) Tom Conti is also against such a tax being levied on the valuable Hampstead home he bought for a song 30 years ago. Last May, when the Lib Dems were proposing a similar tax, Conti said: ‘If the Stalinist Mr Clegg ever got his desire for a mansion tax, we wouldn’t be able to live here.’ The fact is, the millionaire celebrities want to keep this part of North London just as it was when they arrived here a generation ago. Or 55 years ago, in the case of Emma Thompson, who lives in the same West Hampstead street in which she was brought up. In the golden days of the Sixties and Seventies, people could buy a double-fronted house in desirable North London for £30,000. Now those same houses are going for £5 million and these fabulously rich actors want to preserve their neighbourhood just as it was, pulling up the drawbridge behind them — in just the same way that Labour politicians who went to grammar schools prevented others following their path by dismantling the selective schools that had done so much to help social mobility. It’s increasingly hard to afford to live in North London these days. And if this anti-Tesco campaign has its way, fewer people will be able to do their shopping round here, either.","Emma Thompson and other celebrities protesting against Tesco Express .

"A kind act by a grocery store employee in Canada ended up warming hearts around the world. Mary Cogswell, 72, has long been a customer at Halifax's Sobey's grocery store and three months ago she met employee Austin MacNeill. As she's legally blind, she often relies on the staff's help. 'She's just a really nice lady,' MacNeill, 22, said of her. 'She's just friendly to everybody and she knows exactly what she wants when she goes around and it makes it easy for us.' This image of Mary Cogswell, 72, being walked home from shopping at Halifax's Sobey's grocery store by employee Austin MacNeill has gone viral as an act of goodwill . He's helped her walk to her nearby home several times over the last few months but on Friday the simple act went viral when someone took a picture and put it online. Within one day of hitting Facebook the image had more than 13,000 likes and 5,000 shares. MacNeil said he never expected to be so well known, but hopes the image might inspire others. 'One of the ladies from the blind community, she said, ‘You’re more popular than the Queen right now’,' MacNeil joked to Global News. MacNeil said Cogswell is a nice woman who always makes it easy for the staff to help her . Cogswell said in the six years she's shopped at Sobeys the staff has helped her for five. She was declared legally blind in 1987. 'It would be hard. If they weren’t able to help me then I would have to make extra trips down there to get what I need,' she told reporters.","Mary Cogswell, 72, has long been a customer at Halifax's Sobey's grocery store and three months ago she met employee Austin MacNeill .

"Bill Montag, father of reality star Heidi Montag, has been abandoned by his family following his arrest in Colorado on Thursday night on charges of sexual abuse. Nobody visited the 67-year-old on Sunday at Pitkin County Jail as it's feared his wife Terri has fled town, leaving concerned neighbors to take care of their two dogs. A friend of the family told MailOnline that his 'life is in ruins' even if he's found innocent on charges of sexual assault on a child and incest. Wearing an orange jumpsuit behind bars Bill cut a lonely figure during visitation, 10-11am, and was seen staring vacantly at the floor in a communal area while making a short phone call, a witness told MailOnline. 'Abandoned': Bill Montag, father of Heidi, cuts a lonely figure in Pitkin County Jail after being charged with child sex abuse. According to neighbors in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, his wife has fled their home . Allegations: Montag, 67, (pictured with his reality star daughter) was accused of abuse by a different relative . The source revealed how Bill is much older the other inmates – many of which spent free time in the morning pacing the corridors - and stands out like a sore thumb. A friend of the family, Melody Morris, reveals she spoke to wife Terri Montag on Thursday night by text message. Terri did not explain the situation but asked Melody to 'look after and feed my dogs,' without giving any indication how long for or when she plans to return. Three days have passed and Terri is yet to contact Melody, a manager at a resource engineering company and lives opposite the Montag house, to tell her whereabouts or intentions to come home. Melody, 52, said: 'His life is in ruins now. Even if he's proven innocent that dark cloud will still loom over him. 'Fled': Neighbors told MailOnline that Montag's wife, Terri Montag, has not been home for days . Melody Morris, who is dogsitting for Terri, told MailOnline reporter James Robertson, no idea where she is . 'They are a lovely couple and amazing neighbors so nobody would have seen this coming. We're friends so I'm just concentrating on looking after the dogs. 'Terri sent me a message asking me to take care of things here, I haven't asked her about the case because it's so awkward. 'She hasn't told me where she is or when she'll be home – just that I'm in charge of making sure her dogs are fed and watered. She could be anywhere. 'It's a difficult situation for me to be in but nobody knows how they'll react until it happens to them. I'm just helping Terri.' Terri's current location is unknown and all three family vehicles are parked on the driveway of their modest detached bungalow that backs on to a freeway in Glenwood Springs. Bill's been suspended from his job after cops arrested him without incident at his place of employment, Aspen Valley Ski and Snowboard Club. The Aspen Police Department was notified by the FBI that Bill was skiing at Aspen Highlands, he was arrested when he returned to the ACSC offices, police said. Bill was picked up on a failure to appear charge for three counts each of sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust and one charge of aggravated incest. Records claim the abuse lasted for four years. The victim says the abuse began in 1993 and continued until 1998. He is torn between two jails in the process of being extradited from Aspen to Arapho and is incarcerated without possibility of bail. Shocked: According to Morris, the neighborhood was shocked by the news as the Montags are 'lovely' Suspended from work: Bill has been suspended from his job after cops arrested him without incident at his place of employment, Aspen Valley Ski and Snowboard Club . Capt. Larry Etheridge of the Araphoe County Sheriff's office said: 'Allegations were brought forward by a woman, who is now an adult, who had alleged a sexual assault a little more than 15 years ago during a period of time when she was between 14 and 17.' Etheridge said Bill 'denied it all' and 'did not admit guilt' but refused to go into further details regarding the investigation which launched in June. According to NBC 9, 'Due to the statute of limitations, Montag is only eligible to be charged with crimes that occurred after July 1st 1996, when the victim would have been 16 years old.' The victim bravely told she is coming forward after more than a decade in silence to protect other possible victims and young girls. Neither Heidi or sister Holly are considered a victim in the case. TMZ reports Heidi is certain her father with be exonerated and the woman making the allegations 'is determined to destroy the family,' and had previously stalked her and husband Spencer Pratt. If convicted, he could face a prison of four to 12 years and a fine of up to $750,000.","Bill Montag, 67, was charged with sexual abuse on Thursday night .

"The mother of a girl with a fatal disease yesterday begged to be allowed to have Britain's first 'three-parent' baby. Vicky Holliday wants to be able to implant DNA from a donor egg into one of her own eggs which would be fertilised by her partner's sperm. This would stop her passing on her own faulty genetic material to a second child, who would effectively have three parents. British scientists have spent 15 years researching the IVF technique – and MPs will vote tomorrow on whether to make it legal. Vicky Holliday wants to be allowed to have Britain's first 'three-parent' baby, pictured with her daughter Jessica . Supporters – including five Nobel prize winners – have hailed it as a godsend to parents who need to avoid passing incurable diseases to their children. Opponents say that creating 'designer babies' crosses an ethical line and the science is unproven. Miss Holliday's daughter Jessica, who was born in 2013, has Leigh syndrome, which is caused by her mother's faulty mitochondrial DNA. The crippling illness targets the vital organs and means the one-year-old will never walk or talk and is likely to die within a few years. Miss Holliday, a 38-year-old management consultant from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, told the Sunday Times: 'We adore Jessica. To us she's special and unique but to have another child knowing what they could suffer doesn't bear thinking about. 'If MPs vote to allow the treatment it will not only be fantastic for us but help so many others too. 'When you're given the worst possible news it helps to have a little bit of hope. It would mean so much to us to be able to have a healthy child.' Around one in 5,000 Britons are believed to suffer from mitochondrial disorders, which are passed from mother to child, and researchers believe around 2,500 women of child-bearing age are carriers. The Rev Dr Brendan McCarthy said the Archbishops’ Council did not believe there has been sufficient scientific study or consultation into the ethics, safety and efficacy of the technique . Many children with the conditions are disabled and die in infanthood and women carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly. International charities and campaigners wrote an open letter to MPs to lobby them to change the law, saying it 'offers families the first glimmer of hope that they might be able to have a baby that will live without pain and suffering'. It said: 'Mitochondrial disease is unimaginably cruel. It strips our children of the skills they have learned, inflicts pain that cannot be managed, and tires their organs one by one until their little bodies cannot go on any more. 'We know that no novel medical procedure is without risk. We have absolute confidence in the expert scientific panel that has extensively scrutinised these techniques.' Miss Holliday is being treated by Doug Turnbull, a neurology professor at Newcastle University who has pioneered the mitochondrial replacement technique. He is expected to be the first to carry out such treatment, which involves replacing faulty mitochondrial DNA in a mother's egg with healthy cells from a donor. Sally Davies, the Government's chief medical officer, has likened the technique to 'changing a faulty car battery'. But critics including Lord Deben – former Tory minister John Gummer – want a committee to consider if the science is safe before any change to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. A recent safety report by the watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, said the procedure should not be used to create babies until further tests had been carried out. Miss Holliday hopes to watch the vote in the House of Commons from the public gallery with daughter and her partner Keith Newell. If the change is approved by MPs and peers, it will not become law until October. The Church of England has warned against making a decision without knowing more about how hereditary characteristics are passed on by mitochondria – the tiny 'engine rooms' that power cells in the body.","Vicky Holliday wants to be allowed to have Britain's first 'three-parent' baby .

"Ash dieback has spread the length and breadth of England, official data shows. The devastating disease affecting ash trees, first detected in Britain in East Anglia in 2012, is now found from Cornwall to Northumberland. It has also spread into a handful of sites in Scotland and Wales, information published by the Forestry Commission shows. The number of British woods affected by the disease has tripled in little over two years, with nearly 1,000 sites showing signs of the fungus that causes it. Ash dieback, first detected in Britain in East Anglia in 2012, is now found from Cornwall to Northumberland . In December 2012 the microscopic fungus chalara fraxinea was found in 291 sites. On January 6 this year officials found the disease in 949 sites. Most experts now accept there is little chance of killing the disease, with all activity focused on simply slowing its spread. But the new report suggests that the Government's efforts so far have made little impact. More than £16.5million has been spent tackling ash dieback and other tree diseases, including trying to find a strain of ash resistant to the chalara fungus. That search has so far been fruitless and scientists believe the ash problem will eventually spread into every woodland in the country. The problem is the biggest threat to British woodlands since Dutch elm disease killed off 25million mature trees in the 1970s and 1980s. It could have a huge impact on other species. A total of 955 species rely on ash trees, including wood mice, squirrels, bullfinches, wrens, bats and beetles. Of these, 45 species rely solely on ash, including the large ash bark beetle, centre-barred sallow moth and scarce yellow pinter crane fly which are all likely to become extinct in Britain. Elizabeth Truss, Environment Secretary, said: 'We are doing all we can on ash dieback. It is a serious issue' Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss accepts there is no quick answer to the problem. 'We are doing all we can on ash dieback. It is a serious issue,' she told The Sunday Telegraph. 'We're looking at various ways of dealing with it but we don't have a magic bullet. We don't have a solution and we're still carrying out research on that.' The disease, which causes rapid leaf loss, works particularly quickly on young plants, killing them within a year. Older trees can withstand the initial infection but tend to die after several seasons of attacks. The disease was first recorded in Poland in 1992, but was unheard of in Britain until late 2012. It is believed to have been introduced by spores blown across the Channel or by imported saplings. Restrictions on the movement of ash plants were introduced two years ago but the disease has continued to spread.","Disease affecting ash trees first detected in Britain in East Anglia in 2012 .

"Sir Jeremy Heywood has been asked to urgently set out who will be Prime Minister after the General Election, if there is a hung parliament . Britain's top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood has been asked to urgently set out who will be Prime Minister after the General Election, if there is a hung parliament. MPs have warned that the increasing likelihood of neither the Tories nor Labour winning a majority on May 7, means that the public must be told what 'the rules of the game' are. But they risk controversy by calling for the all-powerful Cabinet Secretary to clarify whether David Cameron will remain in office until a new Government is formed and what his powers would be. In 2010, then prime minister Gordon Brown was accused of 'squatting' in Downing Street for five days after the election, until the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were able to form a coalition. And five years on, MPs on the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee say in a report out today that there is 'continuing dispute' what the rules are if there is no overall winner. While these decisions should be made by cabinet ministers, the MPs note that no minister has responsibility for updating the Cabinet Manual, the book which lays out all government procedure. They recommend that despite confusion over the role of the incumbent prime minister who stays on, there principle that there 'must always be a government…is unambiguous'. The convention is that the previous prime minister does not offer their resignation straight away, due to the need to have a Government in office in case 'of a natural disaster or another meltdown in the Eurozone or some foreign policy or military emergency in the Balkans or the Middle East where we need a Government that can act', it is explained in the report. But the MPs note that this is not set in stone and 'it remains to be seen whether or not these examples will be regarded in future as having established a constitutional convention.' 'For the benefit of the media and the general public, the Cabinet Secretary should set out clearly, and well in advance of the forthcoming general election, the Government's view of the constitutional principles which underpin the continuance in office or otherwise of administrations following a general election', the report says. Polls suggest the Conservatives and Labour are neck and neck, with both facing the possibility of ending up as the largest party . Polls suggest Labour and the Conservatives are neck and neck, with both facing the possibility of ending up as the largest party, but needing to negotiate a coalition with one or even two other parties. The report says the public must be clear on what the rules are, so they will expect the incumbent leader to stay on until an alternative government is a position to ask the Queen to take office. Committee chair Graham Allen MP said: 'For example, in the aftermath of the 2010 election, as the makeup of the new coalition Government was being negotiated, the conventions governing when the sitting Prime Minister should resign were not clear and poorly communicated. 'In the absence of a written constitution these things are governed by convention, so you can see how in some circumstances an impasse or power vacuum could arise. It would be much better to have clarity, and to have the rules of the game clearly set out.' The report notes: 'It is surely vital to a properly-functioning democracy that the public has access to clear, objective and unambiguous information about the process whereby administrations are formed and the roles of the key players.'","MPs have warned that neither Tories nor Labour might win majority .

The Oregonian reported that Beard saw other hunting-related engagement snaps and wanted the couple to try a new spin. She is a dental hygienist and Hogevoll is a tugboat captain, according to the newspaper. In an interview with the news outlet, Beard said 'So I told Brady, ""What if we did one, and we hung you from the tractor?"" And he looked at me and was like, ""Well, by my ankles?""'

The Oregonian reported Hogevoll tested knots ahead of the engagement photo shoot, and Beard's father created the sign. Beard passed the photo along to the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the newspaper reported. On the foundation's Facebook page, over 163,000 Facebook users have already 'liked' the photo, and over 30,000 have shared it online. According to The Oregonian, the couple has known each other since the age of nine. 'Hunting is just a small part of our lives. It just happened to go viral,' Beard told the newspaper. She also said of seeing the photo everywhere 'At first, it's really shocking. You don't ever expect for your face or your picture to go all over the country.' Beard and Hogevoll are planning to marry September 5 this year.","Stevie Beard and Brady Hogevoll's engagement photo is now being widely circulated online .

"Vic Emery filed three claims including one for mileage to attend the funerals of the crash's victims . The head of the organisation that oversees Police Scotland charged hundreds of pounds to the taxpayer to attend funerals of victims of the Clutha helicopter tragedy. Vic Emery was accused of leaving an ‘exceptionally bad taste’ after demanding money to pay his respects. Mr Emery, the £90,000-a-year chairman of the Scottish Police Authority (SPA), attended the funerals of pilot Captain David Traill, PC Tony Collins and PC Kirsty Nelis. He filed three claims, including one for £135, and another for £540, as well as mileage. He has since used the money to make a donation to the Clutha Trust, which supports disadvantaged young people. However, frontline officers were horrified that he ever thought it was appropriate to charge expenses. Brian Docherty, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, said: ‘Hundreds of police officers willingly gave up their own time to attend the funerals and memorials of the Clutha victims and did so simply because it was the right thing to do.’ Mr Traill, who was attached to the Police Scotland air support unit, and the two constables were killed when the Eurocopter EC 135 crashed on to the Glasgow bar in November 2013. Patrons John McGarrigle, Mark O’Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins and Samuel McGhee were killed and Joe Cusker later died in hospital, taking the death toll to ten. The Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) is set to publish its conclusions into the cause of the crash soon. The funeral of Captain Traill was held at the University of Glasgow. PC Collins was buried on Arran and a funeral was held for PC Nelis at St Andrew’s Cathedral in Glasgow. The £90,000-a-year chairman of the Scottish Police Authority, pictured above at the funeral of Constable Tony Collins, said the services were 'professional commitments' Scores of uniformed officers attend the funeral of PC Collins. Critics said Mr Emery's actions were in 'exceptionally bad taste' However, the SPA chief defended his decision. Mr Emery said: ‘I felt it important to ensure that the SPA was represented at each of these occasions, and we all judged that these were professional responsibilities as well as personal commitments. ‘We will clearly reflect on these examples in considering our future commitments and will seek further clarity from the Scottish Government on what constitutes corporate and personal activities.’ A spokesman for the police watchdog said: ‘Senior police officers made attending these events a priority for their professional time. The SPA also shared that approach. ‘SPA members are non-executives and are remunerated at a day rate for their duties, plus travel expenses. ‘It is SPA’s view that all of the activities listed are appropriate activities for non-executive board members to have undertaken as corporate responsibilities and commitments, and to have included within the range of duties for which they are reimbursed.’ Ten people died as a result of the accident which saw the helicopter crash through the pub's ceiling (above)","Vic Emery filed three expenses claims over funerals of crash victims .

"Thousands of immigrants seeking legalization through the U.S. court system have had their hearings canceled and are being told by the government that it may be 2019 or later before their futures are resolved. Some immigration lawyers fear the delay will leave their clients at risk of deportation as evidence becomes dated, witnesses disappear, sponsoring relatives die and dependent children become adults. The increase in cancellations began late last summer after the Justice Department prioritized the tens of thousands of Central American migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, most of them mothers with children and unaccompanied minors. Maximiano Vazquez-Guevara, left, his wife Ashley Bowen, and their 6-year-old daughter, Nevaeh Vazquez, would benefit from Vazquez-Guevarra recently winning his appeal to become a legal permanent resident. But his case still needs to go in front of an immigration judge one last time, and it has been pulled from the docket . Immigration lawyers in cities that absorbed a large share of those cases, including New York, San Antonio, Los Angeles and Denver, say they've had hearings canceled with little notice and received no new court dates. Work permits, green cards, asylum claims, and family reunifications hang in the balance. Denver immigration lawyer David Simmons said he's never seen such a standstill in nearly 30 years of practice. 'There is no maneuverability,' he said. 'It's as if we have no court at all.' One of Simmons' clients, Maximiano Vazquez-Guevarra, 34, recently won his appeal to become a legal permanent resident. But his case still needs to go in front of an immigration judge one last time, and it has been pulled from the docket. Vazquez, who is from the Mexican state of Guanajuato, entered the U.S. illegally in 1998. He has been fighting deportation since 2011, when he came to authorities' attention after his second driving under the influence charge. He lives in suburban Denver with his American wife, Ashley Bowen, and their 6-year-old daughter, and they are expecting their second child in August. Meanwhile Vazquez's brother in Mexico is dying of kidney failure, and Vazquez can't leave the country. 'It's sad,' Vazquez said in a telephone interview. 'I feel bad not seeing him, to say one last goodbye.' Before July, only immigrants in detention were considered a priority for the courts. Under the new policies, unaccompanied minors and families facing deportation also have priority status, regardless of whether they're in detention. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, the Justice Department body that oversees the nation's immigration courts, could not say precisely how many hearings had been canceled. But it said more than 415,000 immigrants who are not in detention have cases pending. Hearings are being rescheduled for Nov. 29, 2019, as a way to keep cases on the docket, said Lauren Alder Reid, legislative and public affairs counsel for EOIR. Most, however, are likely to receive other dates - either earlier or later, as docket times become available, she said. Simmons said thousands of non-priority cases in Denver alone have had hearings canceled. Thousands of immigrants seeking legalization through the U.S. court system have had their hearings canceled and are being told by the government that it may be 2019 or later before their futures are resolved . When the surge hit last summer, immigration courts there were already short two judges because of retirements. Two of the three remaining Denver immigration judges are hearing, via videoconference, cases of families detained in a new detention center in South Texas. The third Denver judge is hearing cases involving unaccompanied minors who've been placed with relatives. David Martin, a law professor at the University of Virginia who worked for two Democratic presidents, criticized Congress and the Obama administration for not funding more immigration judges. 'You fund more investigators, more detention space, more border patrol, almost all of these are going to produce some kind of immigration court case,' he said. 'You are putting a lot more people into the system. It's just going to be a big bottleneck unless you increase the size of that pipeline.' San Antonio's immigration courts, which like Denver's are handling a large number of unaccompanied children and detained families, also have seen the cancellations of all non-detainee hearings, which are not considered priority. Lance Curtright, a San Antonio lawyer, said hearings have been postponed for hundreds of cases his firm is handling. Longtime green card holders facing deportation over minor crimes or procedural issues are going to suffer needlessly, along with their families, he said. 'This is their home, and they don't know if they are going to be forcibly removed from it,' he said. 'And they are not going to get any resolution on that until 2019.' Limbo does not jeopardize all immigrants facing deportation as many are still able to work under existing permits until their cases can be heard. Limbo does not jeopardize all immigrants facing deportation as many are still able to work under existing permits until their cases can be heard . The delays might even provide some immigrants with weaker petitions more time to build a stronger case. 'Moving the docket back four years to some people will be devastating,' said Anthony Drago, an immigration lawyer in Boston. 'To other people it's, wow, four years in the United States.' Asylum seekers, who often have had to leave behind families in countries ravaged by war and violence, are among the hardest hit, said Bryan Johnson-Xenitelis, an immigration lawyer in New York. His firm has had eight case hearing cancellations so far, including that of a severely disabled young man from Ukraine with an asylum petition. Another dozen asylum claims at his firm have not been scheduled. Many fear that cases like these will linger indefinitely at the bottom of the pile if there's another wave of Central American migrants. 'Starting May or June, there is likely going to be another surge of unaccompanied kids or families,' said Manoj Govindaiah, a lawyer for the San Antonio-based Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. 'Presumably this issue is going to continue.'","Some immigration lawyers fear the delay will leave their clients at risk of deportation as evidence becomes dated, witnesses disappear, sponsoring relatives die and dependent children become adults .

"New York's Uber drivers will soon be allowed to turn their black cars into yellow cabs. The Taxi and Limousine Commission have approved a pilot program that will let up to 400 drivers convert any TLC car less than two years old into a yellow taxi. The move comes after a number of yellow cabbies who had painted their cars black in order to work for Uber are now regretting making the switch. The city hopes the program will bring down expenses for drivers, as well as make it easier for hacks to switch from working in one part of the industry to another. Scroll down for video . Pilot project: Some Uber drivers will soon be able to paint their black cars yellow and use them as city cabs . Like regular taxi cabs, the drivers would still need to lease a cab medallion, which costs about $120 a day, before hitting the road. 'We're hoping to make it easier for drivers to move between segments and maximize their economic opportunities,' said TLC spokesman Allan Fromberg to the New York Post. Uber has also given its support to the program. 'Anything that opens up more opportunities for drivers, as the Uber app did three years ago, is great for riders and great for cities,' said spokesman Matt Wing. A number of yellow cab drivers were lured to Uber because of the freedom the company supposedly offers with the ability for drivers to pick and choose when they want to work. Not so hot: Uber is disputing claims drivers are leaving en masse, pointing to company surveys that claim its New York drivers make around $30 an hour, which they say is twice what yellow cab drivers earn . Regular taxi drivers have to lease their cars from a garage by the shift or by the week. However, often they are locked into multi-year contracts, making it very difficult to make a move. This new program will allow drivers to pick and choose. However, a number of cabbies are disenchanted with Uber, which often runs promotions guaranteeing new drivers as much as $10,000 a month for a limited time if they make the switch. 'I've spoken to many cab drivers who have left say who say they weren't happy with the money they were making, and the leasing arrangements with their cars,' Michael Woloz, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Taxi Cab Board of Trade, which reps medallion owners told the Daily News. Crossover: The new pilot program marks the first time in nearly 20 years that the city has allowed drivers to use previously owned cars as yellow cabs . 'They're coming to the garages, and saying they want to come back.' Uber disputes claims  drivers are leaving en masse pointing out that drivers can earn $30 an hour in New York which is double that earned by those driving yellow cabs. Under the new rules, cars on the TLC's list of approved vehicles - including the Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus, and Chevrolet Impala - can be repurposed into yellow cabs, complete with a meter. Drivers must have a valid TLC taxi driving license, and the car must have been previously used as a for-hire vehicle.","The Taxi & Limousine Commission has quietly adopted a pilot program .

"The anti-immigration party Ukip has been mocked for sending out propaganda leaflets delivered by a migrant from Bulgaria. Labour councillor Peter Wallace said he witnessed 'hypocrisy of the highest order' when he received the six-page party pamphlet posted through his door in Kent by the Eastern European. When the leaflet, promoting anti-EU candidate David Little, was delivered  last month the Dover district councillor decided to approach the courier and find out where he was from. Labour councillor Peter Wallace has mocked Ukip as 'a party of hypocrites' after it had leaflets promoting anti-EU candidate David Little (right) delivered by a Bulgarian migrant . Councillor Wallace said: 'After the leaflet came through the door I went up to a man and asked if he delivered it. He said he did deliver it but his English wasn't too good. 'He said in a thick accent he didn't like the leaflets but he was being paid to do it. I thought ""bloody hell"" it's a Bulgarian delivering these leaflets, that's a bit weird. 'It's particularly weird he's Bulgarian because last year Ukip were saying ""the Bulgarian's are coming, they are going to take your jobs"". But now we see that it's them who are employing them.' Councillor Wallace added: 'It's hypocrisy of the highest order, as well as flat out incompetent.' The original tweet about this incident has been shared on Twitter more than 1,000 times. However, Ukip's Parliamentary candidate claimed his party is boosting the local economy by employing people and this case shows his party is 'non-discriminatory'. The six-page pamphlet delivered by the Bulgarian. The man said he did not agree with what was inside but was 'just doing what he was paid to do' Little has since applauded the Bulgarian man, who is employed by Kent Distributions, for handing out the leaflet on January 22. He said: 'We wouldn't ask if they have got any Pakistanis, Jamaicans or people with ginger hair working for them, would we? We are a non-discriminatory party. 'I think it's absolutely fantastic UKIP is employing people and boosting the local economy. Shouldn't that be applauded? 'The young Bulgarian man has come here to make a better life for himself and he's been doing a fantastic job for us.' Both Labour and Conservative parties have used the leaflet company in the past, according to the distributors list of clients on its website. Little previously came under fire after he posted a cartoon of Great Britain with an arrow showing African immigrants coming from 'Bongo Bongo Land' and 'millions and millions' of migrants coming from Eastern Europe.","Labour councillor Peter Wallace said it was 'hypocrisy of the highest order'

"A brave toddler who is gravely ill with cancer has been targeted by a sick Twitter troll who say the little boy 'deserves to die'. Riley Hoult, who is 23 months old, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma a few months ago, and was forced to undergo gruelling chemotherapy over Christmas. His ordeal has inspired thousands of people - including reality TV star Kim Kardashian - after his mother Sophie set up a social media diary to chronicle his battle with cancer. Ill: Toddler Riley Hoult is battling an aggressive form of childhood cancer called neuroblastoma . Inspiration: Riley's mother Sophie has used social media to chronicle his battle with the illness . But now a vile Twitter account called @funny-cancer has stolen Riley's photograph and used it to mock cancer sufferers. The social network has acted quickly to delete the offensive profile - but police are unlikely to take action against the anonymous web troll. Ms Hoult, 20, said she was 'disgusted' to find the account using a photograph of her with a bandage and feeding tube. The profile - which claims to be based in Riley's hometown of Leeds - uses the tagline 'Cancer is funny because people die lol.' Its heartless tweets include: 'People with cancer deserve to die.' Vile: A Twitter troll has used a photograph of Riley to mock cancer sufferers . Treatment: The toddler faces a year of treatment including chemotherapy and surgery . After Ms Hoult contacted West Yorkshire Police about the account, they advised her to get in touch with Twitter, which proceeded to ban the profile. 'I reported it to Twitter that Riley was being harassed,' she said. 'I'm disgusted. I suppose they got access to a picture from the Facebook page. Because it's a picture of Riley I just think it is aimed at Riley. 'I think it's absolutely disgusting. Can you imagine all those families that have had people die of cancer? It's awful, they are sick in the head.' Twitter user Ashley Gilkes wrote online: 'This page is sick. Have reported this to Twitter. Riley is a beautiful brave boy. Cancer is not funny and neither are you.' Ordeal: Riley had to undergo 48 hours of chemotherapy at Christmas after being diagnosed . Support: Reality TV star Kim Kardashian has tweeted about Riley as part of the social media campaign . A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said that the force was unlikely to take any action over the messages. Sending 'grossly offensive' messages online can be a crime under the Malicious Communications Act 1988 - but authorities would have to identify the person behind the account before they were able to prosecute. Riley has drawn the attention of the world thanks to his mother, who set up a page called Riley's Journey to track his battle with the disease. In December, Kim Kardashian tweeted: 'I'm praying for you little man. Be strong. Love you.' At the time of Riley's hospital stay at Christmas, doctors said his treatment would take around a year to complete. He faces months of chemotherapy followed by operations to remove the multiple tumours which have formed around his skull.","Riley Hoult is battling neuroblastoma with chemotherapy and surgery .

"Three holidaymakers from France have been deported and banned from Cambodia after they were caught taking naked pictures of each other at one of the largest religious sites in the world. The Frenchmen posed in the buff at a Buddhist temple within the sprawling Angkor complex for a series of cheeky snaps that angered and offended authorities. After they were arrested at Banteay Kdei temple last Thursday the tourists faced a swift trial, and were convicted of producing pornography and ‘exposure of sexual organs’, the Cambodia Daily reported. Three French tourists were deported after taking naked pictures of each other at the Angkor temple complex . As punishment the cheeky travellers– identified by Cambodian media as Rodolphe Fourgeot, 21, Alexandre Vix, 21, and Vincent Bocquet, 20 – were given six-month suspended sentences and a fine of one million riels (approximately £160), and their camera equipment was confiscated. They have been banned from returning to Cambodia for four years as the Siem Reap provincial court attempted to set a precedent to discourage similar acts at the Unesco World Heritage Site. Deputy prosecutor Sok Keo Bandith told the newspaper: ‘We used the procedure of deportation in order to warn other foreigners.’ Authorities said the exhibitionists confessed to making a mistake and asked for forgiveness from Cambodians. CambodiaExpatsOnline.com published photos of the travellers. Authorities said the men have taken similar photos of each other during their travels around the world . The historic Angkor complex covers approximately 150 square miles and is best known for its Angkor Wat temple, the largest religious monument in the world and Cambodia’s most famous tourist attraction with more than 1.5 million visitors a year. Angkor was the home of the Khmer empire from the 9th to 15th centuries and contains the remains of different capitals. Chau Sun Kerya, a spokeswoman for Apsara Authority, which manages the complex, said the men’s photos were intended for personal use. Vincent Bocquet, 20, was one of three holidaymakers arrested after posing nude at an Angkor temple . The exhibitionists, including 21-year-old Rodolphe Fourgeot,  asked for forgiveness from Cambodians . A prosecutor said it was believed the men, including Alexandre Vix, 21, would use the photos in a calendar . She told the Cambodia Daily: ‘Based on their answers, they had no intention to do business with these pictures, and they used to take photos for fun like this in other countries, too.’ But prosecutor Koeut Sovannareth told AFP that authorities believe the men intended to use the nude photos in a calendar. The case came just days after Apsara Authority launched an investigation into online photos that showed a young woman posing topless. As the photos went viral on social media it was claimed they were taken at the Angkor Archaeological Park, but investigators said it appeared the woman was 'photoshopped' into images of the religious site. The Frenchmen faced a swift trial after they were arrested at the Banteay Kdei Buddhist temple . A spokeswoman for the complex's manager said the men’s photos were intended for personal use . The Frenchmen aren’t the first tourists to run afoul of the law while visiting the complex. Last October a 40-year-old woman from New Zealand admitted to breaking a Buddha statue at the Bayon temple. She was questioned by police and released, and had left the country by the time authorities attempted to arrest her the following day.","Authorities were angered when the Frenchmen were caught in the buff .

"New details surrounding the murder of drug kingpin Carl Williams have emerged, claiming he was bashed to death in jail over fears he was being 'downloaded' by police. Williams, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for playing his part in the murder of four people, was murdered at Barwon prison in April 2010. Reports have surfaced that Williams was being used by police as a source of information on unsolved gangland crimes in Victoria and crooks were becoming increasingly worried about what he would reveal. Scroll down for video . New details surrounding the murder of drug kingpin Carl Williams have emerged, claiming he was bashed to death in jail over fears he was being 'downloaded' by police . Williams was beaten to death with an exercise bike by fellow inmate Matthew Johnson in 2010. Johnson was sentenced to a minimum of 32 years in prison for the gruesome murder. Williams, known as the baby-faced killer, was a key figure in Melbourne's brutal underworld war of the 1990s and immortalised in the popular TV series 'Underbelly'. He was a central figure in Melbourne's violent criminal war which began in the late 1990s and eventually claimed more than 25 lives, with a sentencing judge describing him as a 'puppet master' who decided who lived and who died. Williams, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for playing his part in the murder of four people, was murdered at Barwon prison in April 2010 . Before he was killed, 39-year-old Williams had been assisting detectives with the murder of police corruption witness Terry Hodson. His father, George Williams, has revealed that police had been putting pressure on Williams to help with several other criminal cases. It is believed that if Williams had not been murdered, he may have helped to solve a number of high profile cases.

"This is the shocking moment where Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane's wrist was snapped during a brutal tackle at the Super Bowl. It was the first quarter of the Super Bowl XLIX game and New England Patriots were poised to score and take the lead during their second possession when Lane intercepted a poor attempted endzone pass by the New England Patriots' Tom Brady. The Seahawks cornerback was running the ball back to the 14-yard-line where he was tackled by Julian Edelman. Scroll down for video . Ouch! Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane lands badly after a tackle-  his wrist bending backwards at a 90 degree angle . Sent flying into the air, Lane lands badly. As these gruesome pictures show, the 24-year-old landed on his wrist which was bent back to an unnatural angle before it snaps. He was rushed off the field and into the locker rooms for an x-ray but, unsurprisingly, he did not return to play for the rest of the game. The injury signaled bad luck for the Seahawks who lost the game to the New England Patriots 24-28 on Sunday. Lan's wrist was broken after he was tackled by New England Patriots' Julian Edelman as he ran back to the 14-yard line . Lane was carried off the field and taken to the locker rooms for x-ray- he didn't return for rest of the game . Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane had just intercepted an attempted endzone pass by Tom Brady when he was tackled . Jeremy Lane had made the first big play to negate a nearly eight-minute drive by the Patriots with a leaping interception at the goal line late in the first quarter. Lane made his first pro interception, but was replaced by Tharold Simon after the injury, who got torched by Brady the rest of the way. Brady overcame a second interception and threw for four touchdowns, while Malcolm Butler intercepted Russell Wilson's pass in the end zone with 20 seconds left, helping the New England Patriots beat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 Sunday night for their fourth Super Bowl title. The game ended with Seahawks linebacker Bruce Irvin being ejected in the final seconds for instigating a near-brawl, delaying the celebration for the Patriots. Sunday's Super Bowl was a record-breaker for New England Patriots quarterback Brady who surpassed Joe Montana's record of 11 Super Bowl touchdowns. Brady has equaled Montana with four Lombardi Trophies and three Super Bowl MVPs. He stands alone with 13 Super Bowl touchdown passes. The Patriots are still being investigated for using for those under-inflated footballs the AFC championship game. With New England Patriots holding a 28-24 lead in the final minute, the game temporarily spiraled out of control after Patriots quarterback Tom Brady tried to run out the clock .

"Angry passengers complained of ‘chaos’ while they were stuck in long queues at Edinburgh Airport last night after security workers failed to show up for work. Hundreds of travellers became trapped in the queues with many reporting delays of an hour while staff scrambled to clear the backlog – just a few hours before the start of National Sickie Day. Passengers claimed to the Edinburgh Evening News that they were told 13 out of 14 security workers called in sick, but the airport insists only three staff members were absent. Angry passengers complained of ‘chaos’ while they were stuck in long queues at Edinburgh Airport . At the height of the disruption, queues filled with disgruntled holidaymakers stretched from security checkpoints to check-in desks. David Mason told the newspaper he waited more than an hour before passing through security prior to his flight to Dublin. The 56-year-old management consultant said: ‘I was told that 13 out of 14 security staff members had called in sick. The crowd is being very patient at the moment, but I’m sure that could change. There has been absolutely no information given to passengers.’ A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport told MailOnline Travel the delays occurred when a 'high number' of passengers arrived while some employees were absent. Travellers reported delays of an hour at Edinburgh Airport as staff scrambled to clear a backlog . He said: ‘We did have a period last night where we had a lot of passengers arrive at the airport in a short period of time. ‘Things were resolved pretty quickly and there haven’t been any repeat issues since.’ The spokesman said a ‘huge amount’ of passengers arrived between 5pm and 7pm, and the situation resolved itself at about 8pm as the backlog cleared. He said he doesn’t know why so many workers were absent on the same day, adding it was ‘certainly not a protest’. Queues filled with disgruntled holidaymakers stretched from security checkpoints to check-in desks . Edinburgh Airport said individual passengers were called forward so they wouldn't miss their flights . The spokesman added: ‘It was an unfortunate incident but our teams on the ground were working really hard to get people through as quickly as possible. ‘If a flight was getting ready to depart we were calling people forward so they didn’t miss it.’ Frustrated passengers sent tweets to the airport’s Twitter account or to their own followers while they were stuck in a queue. Gareth Price wrote: ‘Chaos at #edinburgh airport this evening!! Very long queues to get into security!! Arrive early!!’ Edinburgh Airport responded to its followers with a series of tweets apologising for the delays. After being flooded with tweets Edinburgh Airport sent a series of messages apologising for the delays . Edinburgh Airport said the delays were caused by an influx of passengers while some staff were absent . Some Twitter users speculated the mass absence had something to do with National Sickie Day. The first Monday of February is traditionally when the highest number of workers ring in sick on a single day. Others wondered if it had anything to do with the Old Firm derby involving Celtic and Rangers. In November, best-selling Scottish author Ian Rankin lashed out at Edinburgh Airport security after he was caught in a lengthy queue with other travellers. The 54-year-old Inspector Rebus author vented his frustration on Twitter, where he complained about the airport’s ‘overrun’ system while he was delayed. Edinburgh Airport denied his claim that the delay he experienced was due to the trialling of a new £25m security hall alongside its existing one.","Passengers claimed they were told 13 out of 14 workers called in sick .

"Have you ever been spooked by a bump in the night? Chances are it was the heating kicking in, or a draught slamming a door shut. But there are a some who are so convinced such sounds have paranormal origins that they spend their life looking for evidence. Now one such investigator has devised a so-called ‘pocket ghost detector’ that wouldn’t seem out of place in the Ghostbusters film. Called GhostArk, the detector was designed by Italian paranormal investigator Massimo Rossi.

Typically, the ‘voices’ aren’t heard at the time, and are only identified during playback. ‘I must say that paranormal research isn’t based on the strongest foundations,’ said Mr Rossi. ‘A paranormal researcher is more like a Victorian explorer than a scientist, he’s seeing a wide unknown territory to be explored, which can contain myriads of exotic plants and animals. ‘When Darwin saw the Galapagos, they were already known for almost 300 years. I’ve never been to Galapagos, yet I have no doubt in my mind that they exist. ‘We know that the ‘not visible’ exists even at a scientific level, while on the transcendent level we call it the ‘other world’. We know that both of these exists and we need to prove it.

They are categorised in three ways - voices that are very clear and easily understandable, known as Class A voices, Class B voices are clear and heard through headphones, while Class C voices are soft and often indecipherable. Paranormal experts believe that the spirits use energy to ‘electronically manipulate sound’ to make the noises caught on tape. ‘What derives is that a researcher cannot exclude what he cannot see or what he cannot demonstrate. ‘All he has to do is keep being stubborn and keep at it, no matter if he’s being discounted or ridiculed.’ GhostArk is available for pre-order from the manufacturer’s website for a discounted price of $199 (£132), although the scanner will retail for $249 (£165) when it goes on sale later this year.

Ghosts topped the adult’s list on 55 per cent, followed by aliens on 51 per cent and UFOs on 42 per cent. God was at the bottom of their list of beliefs on 25 per cent, behind angels on 27 per cent.

"Daniel Moxen, 27, of Crawley Down, West Sussex, accidentally set fire to his girlfriend during a row which broke out while they were on a train . A roofer who set fire to his girlfriend after they got into a furious row on a train has been spared jail. Daniel Moxen, 27, had started flicking his cigarette lighter on and off 'in frustration', when the flame suddenly caught onto his girlfriend's cardigan. The pair, who had been at a concert together, began desperately patting down the flames in front of terrified passengers. The drama unfolded as the pair were travelling from London Victoria to their home in Redhill, Surrey, in July last year. Luckily, the couple, who the court heard had had 'too much to drink', managed to extinguish the flames and no damage was caused. Moxen, from Crawley Down, West Sussex, who had 28 previous convictions but none relating to arson, had admitted arson on the first day of his trial last year. But the court heard Moxen's girlfriend was standing by him and 'wants him to come home'. Today, a judge at Guildford Crown Court sentenced Moxen to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months. Talking about the victim, defence counsel Irena Ray-Crosby said: 'There was a letter handed in today to Your Honour. 'She has not been allowed to contact the defendant but she is fully in support of him and wants him to come home. 'She is financially dependent on him for the mortgage and he has been meeting her father to pay his share.' She added that Moxen, who had a 'troubled upbringing', accepts that his behaviour was 'exceptionally foolish'. She said: 'The couple had both had too much to drink and he was flicking his lighter on and off in a gesture of frustration and he realised he could smell burning and it was her cardigan. 'Happily no-one was hurt and there was no damage to people or property.' The father-of-one, dressed in a white shirt and grey blazer, stared straight ahead as the judge passed sentence. Judge Neil Stewart said: 'You accept you argued with the complainant and felt agitated, you relieved your stress by flicking a lighter. 'As soon as you realised what had happened, you patted down the flames. The incident broke out after the flame from the lighter (right) caught onto the girlfriend's cardigan as the pair were travelling from London Victoria (left) to their home in Redhill, Surrey (file pictures) 'This all happened on a train and other passengers were unsurprisingly alarmed. 'This is a serious offence. The consequences of causing a fire speak for themselves. Terrible things can and do happen. Fortunately in this case, no harm was caused.' Moxen must also complete a six-month supervision requirement and pay £400 costs.","Daniel Moxen was travelling from London Victoria to Redhill with girlfriend .

"Hannah Hawke, 25, a glamour model from Rawtenstall in Lancashire drove her car drunk and with her baby son in the back . A drunken mother who left two of her young children at home alone while she went for a drive in the early hours has avoided jail. Aspiring model Hannah Hawke, who had drunk several glasses of wine, took her 12-month-old baby boy along in the car. She left his six-year-old brother and three-year-old sister asleep in their beds, making sure the front door was unlocked – so they could ‘run out if there was a fire’. Police later found the bewildered children at the house, distressed and crying and searching for their mother. Hawke, 25, a single mother, had started drinking after putting the children to bed at 8pm. In the early hours her lover rang and asked if she could pick him up from a night out. She decided to take her baby boy with her on the 3am trip as he had woken up. At 3.45am police were alerted to reports of a couple arguing in a Tesco Express car park in Accrington, Lancashire, and of a woman drink-driving. They arrived and found Hawke in the car with her baby boy crying in the back. Officers breathalysed her and she was found to be twice the legal limit. When questioned about the whereabouts of her two other children, Hawke lied and said they were with their aunt. Police went to her sister’s home but when they realised the children weren’t there they went to Hawke’s address. There they found the children in the ‘extremely untidy’ and ‘unclean’ house, desperately searching for their mother. ‘The front door to the property was closed but unlocked and upon entry they saw a little boy standing at the top of the stairs in his underclothes and could hear a young child crying,’ Stephen Parker, prosecuting, told Burnley Crown Court. ‘The girl was crying and had wet herself and her bed. The bed had no sheets covering the mattress and the mattress was wet. The three-year-old asked why her mummy wasn’t there.’ Hannah Hawke (pictured on nights out left and right) left her three-year-old and six-year-old children home alone while she went on a 3am drink drive jaunt with her baby son in the back seat . Hawke admitting to leaving the children unattended at her home in Rawtenstall, for perhaps ‘a little longer’ than half an hour and accepted it was wrong. She admitted drink-driving and child neglect but she escaped jail and was given an 18-month community order with a 10pm to 6am curfew. She was also banned from driving for 16 months and her children have been taken into care. James Heyworth, defending, said Hawke had a ‘regrettable lapse in judgment’ and is now ‘working hard’ to get her children back. But Judge Jonathan Gibson said she would have to ‘bear the consequences’ of her behaviour.","Hannah Hawke had drunk several glasses of wine before getting in her car .

"If you're a family who likes to plan ahead while also enjoying your own space - this £20,000 holiday home could be just what you've been looking for. The hidden nuclear bunker, built in 1960 during the Cold War, was designed to withstand an atomic blast and monitor the aftermath of such an attack. Surrounded by farmland near the village of Ashwell in Hertfordshire, the 20ft by 8ft underground lair is now on the market - boasting a modest bathroom and a monitoring chamber with the ability to connect to a phone line in the event of a catastrophe. Scroll down for video . On the market: This hidden bunker in Hertfordshire, built in 1960 during the Cold War to withstand an atomic blast, can be bought for £20,000 . The bunker, accessible only by a narrow shaft, was constructed by the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) as a military outpost - one of more than 800 across the UK. The small space is currently uninhabited and subject to planning approval but could be put to multiple uses - including a wine cellar, a holiday home or even a doomsday storage unit. Business development director Mark Bradbury, 46, who bought the bunker in 2006 after it was sold to the Ministry of Defence in 1993, claims the possibilities for usage are endless. Mr Bradbury, who lives in Ashwell, just a mile from the hideaway, said: 'The bunker has got a fascinating history, with its origins dating back to the height of the Cold War. View of the countryside: The underground bunker, accessible only through a narrow shaft, is situated around 300 yards from the village of Ashwell in Hertfordshire . Main chamber: The monitoring room takes up most of the bunker's space and can be connected to a phone line in the event of a disaster . 'However you can date the site's military connections even further back to 1931 when the area was used as an outpost to spot foreign military aircraft. 'Back then, it was merely an observation platform on raised stilts, and it was often still used during World War Two for the same purpose. 'It wasn't until 1960 that this role changed when the RoC moved their focus towards the nuclear threat from overseas.' According to official RoC documentation, a team of three would be expected to live underground in the event of a 'nuclear incident', providing reports on the levels of radioactivity in the area. Manned by members of the RoC, drawn mainly from the local community, it was their job to report their findings to the RoC headquarters in Bedford. However the site was decommissioned on September 30 1991 following the global nuclear de-escalation that spelled the end of the Cold War. Mr Bradbury added: 'Despite its military history, I've actually considered converting the space into a bunker themed bed and breakfast. Modest bathroom: The bunker, built as a military outpost by the Royal Observer Corps, also features a toilet . Waiting for interest: Current owner Mark Bradbury says he is yet to have any offers but believes bunkers such as these are popular with those preparing for an apocalypse . 'But I've just not had the time to commit to such a project. 'I've had a few offers come in for it so I'm sure someone with the time and resources will come and put it to use' 'I've heard nuclear bunkers are in demand by preppers looking for a place to hole up in the event of a disaster.' Among the 800 ROC nuclear bunkers were 29 sprawling stations which served as secret headquarters. Many of these larger spaces have now been transformed into luxury properties - including a five-bedroom timber-clad eco-house in Somerset. The underground bunker is surrounded by farmland near the village of Ashwell in Hertfordshire . Britain's secret nuclear bunkers are being put to use in all sorts of ways - from houses and vets' surgeries to recording studios and even a laser tag arena. Much larger than the Hertfordshire hideaway newly on the market, many of these sprawling HQ stations were built with bedrooms, canteens, generators and decontamination rooms. One bunker in Exeter, Devon, has been turned into a post-apocalyptic laser tag arena while another in Yeovil, Somerset, has become a five-bedroom timber-clad eco-house - which was recently on the market for almost £700,000. Nestled into the side of a hill, it was converted after years of laying derelict and being broken into by explorers and the homeless. The entire bunker's ventilation system was overhauled and is now being used to make the house more energy efficient. Secret history: Britain's Royal Observer Corps HQs once held 70 volunteers each who would have helped rebuild Britain after a nuclear war. This one, nestled on a hillside in Yeovil, Somerset, lay empty and derelict for years (pictured) - and has now become a five-bed eco-house . Bunking down: One of the former Yeovil bunker's five bedrooms, with barely a nod to the site's secret Cold War past. It is just one bunker that has found an unusual new use - others include a recording studio, a laser tag arena, a vets' surgery and a mock house for police training. More comfortable: The newly-built house offers a few more home comforts and fewer foil-packed government rations than its previous form . Demise: Almost half of the 29 ROC headquarters have been demolished (in orange) since closing down. The HQs were part of a larger, complex network which also included 11 regional seats of government, two of which have been restored, and hundreds of tiny monitoring posts .","Hidden bunker was built in 1960 as military outpost in event of nuclear war .

"WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . A father and daughter who belonged to a Chinese cult have been executed for beating a woman to death with an iron bar at a McDonald's restaurant as customers watched. Zhang Fan, 29, and Zhang Lidong, 54, were among five members of the banned Quannengshen cult convicted of attacking the woman after she reportedly rebuffed their attempts to recruit her. The pair 'were put to death by the Intermediate People's Court of Yantai city', China's official news agency Xinhua said. Scroll down for video . Zhang Lidong, left, and daughter Zhang Fan, right, were executed for beating a woman to death in a McDonald's . A video emerged after the incident which showed cult members Zhang Lidong beat the victim with an iron bar . China uses both lethal injection and shooting for executions, but the method was not specified. State media gave the executions prominent coverage on Monday, broadcasting CCTV showing the Zhangs in court, as well as replaying a film of the attack. Shortly after the brutal attack in May last year, a three-minute video circulated online showing the incident at a McDonald's in Zhaoyuan, in China's Shandong province. At the time, the clip caused uproar as it showed customers watch while the woman screamed in agony as she was beaten to death. No-one was reported to have tried to help her. The graphic video showed a man resembling Zhang Lidong strike out angrily with a pole and shout: 'Damn you, devil! Go to hell!' Pictured from left, cult members Zhang Fan, Zhang Lidong, Lyu Yingchun, Zhang Hang and Zhang Qiaolian in court on murder charges in August last year . After Zhang's friend joined in the attack, the victim, who is only known as Miss Wu, died at the scene . A three-minute video circulated online and caused uproar as customers were seen watching as the woman was beaten to death . A woman is also heard in the clip screaming: 'Kill her! Beat her to death!' The footage, apparently shot on a mobile phone, only included a fraction of a second showing the person thought to be the victim, only known as Miss Wu. Reports said the victim was having dinner at the fast food restaurant when a man, identified as Mr Zhang, asked for her phone number. When she refused, the violence unfolded over a brief 20-minute period - and Zhang used an iron bar to beat Miss Wu to death right in the middle of the restaurant. Chinese media reported Zhang's friends joined in and also beat Miss Wu, kicking her in the head as she lay on the ground in a pool of her own blood. They then proceeded to use an iron-handled mop to strike her in the head and continued to do so until the handle broke. Miss Wu, 37, who was a mother, died at the scene. Three others convicted over the attack -- including another daughter of Zhang Lidong's - were given prison sentences, ranging from seven years to life, for offences including 'undermining law enforcement using heresy'. Zhang Lidong beat the victim to death after she reportedly rebuffed his attempts to recruit her to his cult . Lyu Yingchun was jailed at the Yantai Intermediate People's Court in Yantai city, after the attack . In the wake of the killing, state media said 1,000 Quannengshen members had been arrested including 'high-level organisers and backbone members'. At the time, Xinhua accused members of the group as being 'responsible for numerous suicides and murders, in which many victims were the perpetrators' family members'. Similar numbers were held at the end of 2012, when the organisation was under the spotlight for predicting an apocalypse and the state-run Global Times said it had called on members to overthrow the Communist Party. Quannengshen, whose name can be translated as Church of Almighty God, believe that Jesus has been reincarnated as a Chinese woman. They refer to the ruling Communist Party as the 'great red dragon'. Reports said the victim was having dinner at the fast food restaurant when a man, identified as Mr Zhang, asked for her phone number . When she refused, the violence unfolded over a brief 20-minute period - and Zhang used an iron bar to beat Miss Wu to death . On its website, where one section is headed 'The Maturer the People Become, the Sooner the Great Red Dragon Will Collapse', the group describes the authorities as 'the persecutor of God and the enemy of God'. The group was outlawed by the government in the mid-1990s and its founders moved to the United States in 2000, Xinhua said. In the months after Miss Wu's murder a number of entries on the group's website attempted to distance it from 'these several ruffians'. The posts claimed that the murder was used by the party as a pretext to crack down on Quannengshen. 'It's not difficult to see that the 'May 28 incident' is completely a false case created by the (party) to frame and condemn the Church of Almighty God,' one post said. 'Prisoners admit a confession by torture. Whatever the (party) asks them to say, they have to say it.' China has previously cracked down harshly on groups it labels 'cults', most notably the Falungong spiritual movement, which was banned in the late 1990s. It has since detained tens of thousands of its members, according to rights groups, with some saying they have been tortured for refusing to give up their beliefs. Falungong insists it is targeted because the Communist Party views it as a threat.

"Dopey: Renea Lucero got her friends arrested after she set up a drug deal with a friend of a friend - who just happened to be a police officer . When Renea Lucero picked up her phone and started dialling last week, she thought she could make a fast buck hawking some heroin or cocaine to a friend of a friend. So when the her call was picked up, the 30-year-old from Albuquerque, New Mexico, made her pitch and arranged to meet the addict close to the city's international airport. Stuffing a small package of heroin into her bra - for safety's sake - Lucero called on her friend Luciano Navarro to drive, and girlfriend Selina Padilla for moral support, and the trio made their way to the McDonald's on San Mateo and Gibson, in Albuquerque's south. The buyer was there, waiting. The gang pulled over and Lucero dug out the drugs and handed it to Navarro, who weighed out the correct amount and exchanged it with the buyer for just $30. The deal, it seemed, had gone down without a hitch and the trio drove off to enjoy the modest spoils of their illegal trade. Except, minutes later, Navarro, Lucero and Padilla were all under arrest. The person Lucero had called, it turned out, was not who she thought - it was an Albuquerque police detective who knew her from a prior criminal case. Court documents filed by the detective, seen by KOB-TV, say that at 2.15pm last Wednesday he picked up a phone call to his department-issued cell phone and got an unexpected offer. 'Do you need anything?' Lucero allegedly asked the detective. The quick-thinking cop played it cool. 'What have you got?' he asked her vaguely. 'Black or white,' she replied, using local slang terms reportedly referring to heroin and cocaine. Of course, it was an offer he couldn't refuse, and he used the opportunity to set up a drug sting. Bad friends: Selina Padilla (left) and Luciano Navarro (right) made the drive to McDonald's for what they thought was a drug deal . Scene of the crime: The McDonald's on San Mateo and Gibson where undercover officers met up with the trio and bought $30-worth of heroin. All three were arrested shortly afterwards . Lucero was arrested on trafficking charges. In questioning, she admitted to detectives that she had called him, and that she mistook him for a friend of her boyfriend, court documents said. She's alleged to have told police she was just trying to raise enough cash for gas to get to Las Lunas. It was not known if she had an attorney, according to the Associated Press.","Renea Lucero thought she was calling a friend of her boyfriend .

"Heather Mack, 19, cradled her growing baby bump as she learned she would stand trial over the murder of her socialite mother on Bali . A heavily pregnant American teenager tenderly cradled her growing baby bump as she was told she will face trial over the murder of her socialite mother on the resort island of Bali. Heather Mack,19,  who is seven months' pregnant, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack and stuffing her body in a suitcase. The young lovers will face a firing squad if they are found guilty. Mack appeared drained as three judges rejected a last ditch attempt by the Chicago couples' defence teams to have the case thrown out. They had  claim that there were 'inaccuracies' on the indictment and it should be annulled at the hearing in Denpasar. The case is now set to resume later this week. 'The indictment is fully qualified both formally and materially according to the law,' said presiding judges Made Suweda. 'Therefore, the defence objections are rejected.' Dressed in matching  white shirts, Mack and Schaefer were handcuffed to each other as they arrived at the District Court. Miss Mack's bulging baby bump was clearly visible. The pair were sent to the island's notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of their trials. They were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the badly beaten body of Mack's 62-year-old mother stuffed inside a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel in Nusa Dua. The accused are being tried separately with the same judges and prosecuting teams at the Denpasar District Court. Prosecutors charged them with premeditated murder, which carries a maximum penalty of death. Scroll down for video . Heather Mack and her co-accused lover, Tommy Schaefer, 21, appeared at court in Denpasar wearing matching white shirts . The pair are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack, pictured, and stuffing her body in a suitcase . Their lawyers argued earlier that inaccuracies in the indictment could lead to multiple interpretations of the suspects' activities and the crime scene, raising questions of whether other people had entered the victim's room and killed her. They also objected to the citing of communications between the defendants on their mobile phones as evidence of premeditated murder, arguing that they are prone to manipulation. Prosecutors have alleged that the couple sent text messages about their initial plan to disguise a murder as suicide on the beach. Both defendants sat quietly as the decision to proceed with the trials was read out by judges. Unlike previous hearings, Schaefer did not dissolve into tears . The young lovers were handcuffed to each other as they arrived at court on the resort island . The pair were sent to the island's notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of the trial . In their indictment, prosecutors said the couple plotted the murder because von Wiese-Mack did not approve of their relationship, and that Mack once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000 before their visit to Bali. It said that an argument over the hotel bill made Mack's mother angry and she scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur, and Schaefer then battered her with a fruit bowl handle. Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, helped stuff her mother's body in the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it, the indictment said. They then hired a taxi and placed the suitcase in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did.

"Tinder is set to launch its much awaited 'Tinder Plus' app allowing users to 'undo' accidental deletes in the US within weeks. The service has already been tested in the UK, but is now about to launch in the US, according to Techcrunch - with an expected price of $6.99 per month. The paid update is expected to allow allow users to search in other locations, although they may be charged extra for this. Scroll down for video . Tinder (screenshots pictured) is rolling out an 'undo' button which will let users undo swipes - letting them revisit profiles that they may have accidentally rejected. The function is due to be rolled out in the UK and elsewhere, but will require a premium subscription to Tinder Plus, which could cost up to $20 (£12.50) a month . Tinder Plus will be the premium version of the free Tinder dating app. Tinder Plus will include an 'undo' button which will let its users undo their swipes - meaning they can revisit profiles they may have been too hasty to dismiss and swipe left. A 'Passport' button will also allow users to search for dates in extra locations. Currently, the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user’s location, whereas Tinder Plus users will be able to toggle between different locations. 'Both of Tinder’s mobile apps recently received updates on the respective app stores where the feature was mentioned in the app’s update text – hinting at an imminent arrival,' Techcrunch said. 'However, Tinder says that Plus is not yet being enabled for end users in the U.S. at this time – and the app’s update text descriptions will be edited to reflect this. 'Instead, the dating service says its U.S. launch is still on track for a mid-to-late March time frame.' The current version of the free dating app allows users looking for love to swipe right to ‘like’ someone and left to pass. If both users like each other, they can chat and share photos with each other. Tinder sees more than 850 million swipes and more than 10 million matches made every single day, with 2 billion matches made to date - but so far has not monetised its app. A new version of the app will display a big yellow ‘undo’ button on the home screen, which members of Tinder Plus will be able to use, but regular users of the free version of the app will be able to see – in a bid to lure them into paying for the service. The app also plans on launching a button on its home screen called Passport, which will let users search for potential dates in extra locations. Currently, the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user’s location, whereas Tinder Plus users will be able to toggle between different locations. The new feature could offer restaurant and sightseeing recommendations in a variety of locations. While this feature may well be used by well-travelled bachelors to plan holiday hook-ups, the company hopes it will be useful to people who travel frequently for work and hope to meet the love of their life. CEO and President of Tinder, Sean Rad (who will be leaving the firm as CEO) told TechCrunch: ‘The most-requested feature we get is a button to go back and have a second chance with people that users swipe left on.’ Mr Rad said: ‘We often hear that people want to be able to start swiping in a location before they’ve left to go on a trip or vacation…We also hear people saying that they want to get recommendations for places to go and where to eat in a new city and Tinder Plus can do better at that.’ There is no date when Tinder Plus will launch in the UK and the trial will only be available to around 40 per cent of users in the first instance. Tinder says this is because it is testing different prices to see whether 99cents (62p), $4.99 (£3.10), $9.99 (£6.30), or $19.99 (£12.50) will be the best fit for consumers. ‘We want to find that sweet spot that most users can agree on,’ Rad said.","Tinder is set to monetise its app by launching a Tinder Plus subscription .

"We were feeling woozy by the time Madame Stella started pouring her 2004 vintage, but at the end of the dimly lit tasting room, the children were as bright as buttons. William, our four-year-old, proudly announced that he could taste a hint of fresh strawberry. Megan, aged two, declared that she'd identified the tang of chocolate. My wife Katie and I, sniffed and slurped, and tried not to hiccup too loudly when Stella asked if 'ze beautiful smooth finish' of her decade-old claret was 'agreeable'. Wine tasting, family style: With a few glasses of grape juice, everyone can detect 'notes of chocolate' It was mid-afternoon at Chateau Bardins, a small winery roughly half an hour's drive from the city of Bordeaux, and we'd reached the stage in every wine-tasting session when fugginess descends. The children had been over-indulging, too. But before anyone calls social services, read on: for while we'd been quaffing fine plonk, they'd enjoyed nothing more intoxicating than a few glasses of alcohol-free grape juice, and some macaroons. These were among the many local delicacies on offer during the Chateau's 'family gastronomic excursion', a guided tour for adults and children, of the local cuisine. This corner of south-western France is gastronomic mecca - but my two free-spirited children's idea of refinement is baked beans, chips and a good food fight. Luxurious: The Grand Hotel de Bordeaux decided to start catering for the family market a few years ago . Transformation: A floor of the palatial, 18th-century building has been largely given over to 'family suites' Treat: Children will be thrilled to discover gift bags containing toys, teddy bears, colouring books, stickers, and sweets in their rooms . Luckily, the Grand Hotel de Bordeaux, a luxurious, 130-room landmark decided to start catering for the family market a few years ago. While it retains all the uniformed flunkies and marble hallways of a five-star establishment, a floor of the palatial, 18th-century building has been largely given over to 'family suites', where there is no tut-tutting at inky-fingered young guests or their parents. The fun began at check-in, where William and Megan met the hotel's 'children's concierge', a charming young man who specialises in everything from babysitters and bottle warmers to child-friendly day-trips (we made use of all three). Then they were thrilled to discover gift bags, with their names on, containing toys, teddy bears, colouring books, stickers, and sweets. In the bathroom were toddler-sized dressing gowns, and cute slippers. An escape zone among the vineyards: The small winery of Chateau Bardins sits just outside Bordeaux . After a hearty lunch, we set off on a guided walking tour of Bordeaux. William and Megan were thrilled by the fearsome gargoyles that inhabit its limestone buildings. The highly prized wine has also made Bordeaux one of France's wealthiest and most glamorous, cities. Its historic centre, filled with mansions and grand public buildings, sits on the Garonne river, from where local products are shipped across the world. Once-grimy buildings are now whitewashed so they have the warm, hue of mature brie. Squares are filled with public art and fairground carousels. A new tramway has been laid, parks contain smart adventure playgrounds (where we spent many happy hours), and the streets are filled with boutiques, buskers, bars and wine shops. A city of charm and elegance: With Saint Andre cathedral at its heart, Bordeaux looks great on camera . But William and Megan's favourite was the famous mirroir de l'eau, a sort of vast civic paddling pool, where they'd have gladly splashed around all weekend. We spent our final afternoon in the rural seclusion of Chateau Bardins - mainly in the tasting room. We drank, the children ate. We made tasting notes; they tried to identify the flavour of each snack from picture cards. No food was thrown. As Madame Stella put it, France's food capital had successfully turned two more young philistines into petits gastronomes.

"Katy Perry's spectacular halftime show at the Super Bowl has been somewhat overshadowed by her unusual choice in backing dancers. The two dancers dressed in shark costumes have won their own league of fans after their awkward moves and depressed expressions went viral. Perry's performance of her hits California Girls and Teenage Dreams saw her appear with dancing palms, beach balls, surf board and sharks. On Monday, dancer Bryan Gaw came forward to admit he was the shark on the left - posting a picture saying 'Yep. The rumors are true. Yours truly.'
