"Washington (CNN) -- Four State Department employees placed on leave after last year's deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, won't be fired, a decision that irritated key congressional Republicans insisting on accountability for security and other shortcomings. A senior State Department official said the employees would be assigned to different jobs, and an agency spokeswoman followed up by saying that an independent review of the matter found problems and raised questions but did not conclude any breach of duty. ""Clearly things could have been done better. I think that's patently obvious to everybody who's followed this for almost a year now,"" said Deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf. ""We have to let the facts lead where they may, and these are people with real lives and real careers, and we can't just take action that's not warranted against them just to make us all feel better."" The sanctioned employees included Eric J. Boswell, who the State Department said had resigned from his post as assistant secretary for diplomatic security but remained with the department while on leave. The other three were not identified. It was not clear what new responsibilities Boswell and the other three would be given. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, who has pressed the State Department to punish employees who lawmakers contend ignored security warnings in advance of the attack last September 11, reacted sharply to the decision by Secretary of State John Kerry. ""Instead of accountability, the State Department offered a charade that included false reports of firings and resignations and now ends in a game of musical chairs where no one misses a single day on the State Department payroll,"" Issa said. He said his committee would expand its investigation to include how the independent analysis of events by the Accountability Review Board resulted in Kerry deciding ""not to pursue any accountability from anyone."" The four employees were placed on leave after the review board in December uncovered bureaucratic failures at the State Department before the attack. Lawmaker: If CNN can interview suspect in attack, why can't FBI? Kerry ordered a review the board's report and studied the workers' careers. In the end, he affirmed the board's finding that no one should be fired, the senior State Department official said. Why Benghazi matters . Issa criticized the department's review of the four employees, saying on Tuesday that it ""did not include interviews with them or their supervisors to either substantiate or challenge allegations."" The Benghazi incident involved scores of militants using rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons against the U.S. diplomatic compound and a nearby predominantly CIA-run annex. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed. The attack has become a flashpoint in the partisan-fueled climate in Washington with Republicans, especially, criticizing the Obama administration's handling of security beforehand and botching the response after. Benghazi attack timeline . Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on 'The Lead' that someone has to be held accountable. ""There is not a single thing that was done to protect of fortify that facility, nor did (Secretary of State Hillary) Clinton do anything to give them more personnel,"" he said. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, ""I don't understand how this administration will ensure accountability at one of our most vital government departments without disciplining those who fail in their duties."" CNN's Evan Perez, John King, Elise Labott, Jamie Crawford and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Four employees had been on administrative leave since December .

"London (CNN) -- When John Steinbeck wrote ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" the 1939 novel about the plight of tenant farmers driven from their Oklahoma home, he was intending in his own words to ""rip a reader's nerves to rags."" In doing so, the Californian author was also fulfilling what British researchers have proved, that literature mirrors the economic conditions of the previous decade. The so-called ""Literary Misery Index,"" devised by statisticians at Bristol University, shows how often words associated with sadness appeared in print, year by joyless year. They compared their index to a standard ""Economic Misery index"" -- based on rates of unemployment and inflation -- and concluded that there is a link between the two. The study, made public on a dreary day in January, showed a distinct correlation -- with an 11-year delay -- between the two indices. In other words, about a decade after you have an economic crisis -- you tend to get more expressions of sadness in literature. The heavy-hearted conclusion: Hard times make for miserable books. So phrases like ""a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize..."" is just what Steinbeck should have been writing in 1939, 10 years after the Wall Street crash known as Black Tuesday, and at the end of a wretched decade for the U.S. economy that saw a severe decline, double-digit unemployment, drought and dustbowl. And the painfully high inflation and unemployment of the 1970s and early 1980s may have had an influence on Bret Easton Ellis, whose first novel, ""Less Than Zero,"" came out in 1985. ""Dark"" and ""darkness"" runs through the novel, whose motto is ""Disappear Here."" ""Trent calls me the next night and tells me that he's feeling depressed..."" writes Easton Ellis, as Clay. The researchers contend that it's not only novels which are influenced by economic despondency. The research includes all types of publications. Of the millions of books used in the study, only around 10% were fiction. It means biographies, histories -- maybe even cook books -- which were written in the aftermath of economic decline will statistically speaking contain more ""sad"" words... like ""sorrow"", ""weeping"" or ""melancholy"", . Professor R. Alexander Bentley, Head of the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, at Bristol University, said: ""To me the study confirms that we do have a collective memory that conditions the way we write, and that economics is a very important driver of that."" Maybe that's why they call it the ""dismal science."" Even though John Steinbeck was writing about America in the 1930s -- ""The Grapes of Wrath"" contains many themes which will have a grim resonance for today's readers. ""The bank is something else than men. It happens that every man in a bank hates what the bank does, and yet the bank does it. The bank is something more than men, I tell you. It's the monster. Men made it, but they can't control it."" (""The Grapes of Wrath"") While that passage doesn't include any of the sad words (the mood is more the ""wrath"" of the novel's title), it taps into the collective consciousness of America just as any of the ""sad"" adjectives might. Steinbeck's book was definitely intended to expose the excoriating cruelty of the Great Depression. This study says that even authors who aren't ostensibly writing about conditions in the economy are somehow infusing their experiences into their work. Our most recent financial and economic crisis began in earnest with the fall of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and many people around the world today are still experiencing the effects. U.S. unemployment hit 10% in October 2009 -- and it's only now beginning to fall to more ""acceptable"" levels. So it seems, going by this study, that we are in for a miserable few years in literature. The dreary deluge should begin in around 2018. By then, the economy may be in a better place. Novelists will still be working it out. And if your new recipe book sounds a little bit depressing -- now you know why.","British researchers have proven that literature mirrors economic conditions of previous decade .

"Qusayr, Syria (CNN) -- Qusayr is a ghost town these days. Only a few people can be seen scavenging through the rubble hoping to find anything worth salvaging from the carcasses of residential buildings in this war-ravaged city in western Syria. But there isn't very much to salvage after a major government offensive ousted rebels from the city, which is strategically located near the border with Lebanon and very close to the main highway connecting Damascus to Syria's coast and to northern cities like Aleppo. ""Of course we want to come back here,"" an elderly man told me. ""We are hoping for government support to make this Qusayr worth living in again."" The man's name is George. He said his family have just returned after fleeing to the city of Homs when rebels took over the town more than a year ago. George was cleaning up his house and led me through ransacked rooms. ""They stole everything,"" he said. He means the anti-government forces, whom the Assad government labels as terrorists but are supported by many Western and Middle Eastern countries. George then showed me a hole in the roof. ""Rocket."" That was his only word as we looked up at the sun that now shone in through the gap in his ceiling. The opposition took over control of Qusayr in February 2012. The town became an important supply hub for weapons for rebel fighters in central Syria because of its proximity to the Jordanian border. It is also important for the government because it is located near a vital supply line for the Syrian military fighting in Idlib, Aleppo and other places in the region. After a long siege of the city by pro-Assad forces, Syria's military enlisted the help of Hezbollah, the radical Islamist Shiite militia from Lebanon. Assad's army and Hezbollah forces launched an offensive in early June of this year and re-took Qusayr on June 5. But the cost of re-taking the city was clearly immense. Driving through town we could not find a single building left unscathed. In the central square, the iconic clock tower was destroyed. An ancient mosque had also suffered several direct hits with a gaping hole left in the minaret. And the city's only church had substantial damage both inside and out with some of the icons defaced. Syrian military personnel on the ground claim Islamic rebels are to blame. A senior commander later showed us on a map how the army moved into Qusayr. ""First we surrounded the city and then we attacked it from all sides. And of course we killed a lot of them and there were a lot of wounded,"" he recalled. ""The rest of them ran away through the valleys and the mountains, mostly to Lebanon. And now we can announce that Qusayr and its suburbs are totally cleansed of Islamist fighters."" The town might be ""cleansed,"" as the officer put it, but in many places in and around Qusayr, the earth is literally scorched. Most of those now returning to the town are Christians, highlighting the increasingly sectarian nature of the conflict in Syria. George is a Christian as well. He says his son was kidnapped by Islamist fighters and he clearly blames some of his Sunni Muslim neighbors for collaborating with the opposition. ""We have been living with the Muslims for generations,"" his wife said as we stood in their ruined apartment. ""I don't know why they did this, why they helped them."" George also took us to his brother's house, which was almost razed to the ground. Many of the rooms were burned from the inside. George said his brother fled when one of his sons was killed by rebel fighters. ""My brother is an engineer. His son came to the door and they shot him because they think all Christians are against them,"" George tells me. Both George and his wife say they could forgive their neighbors but it is hard to see how this community, which before the crisis was majority Sunni Muslim with a substantial Christian minority, could ever go back to what it used to be, even if more people return. The opposition has called the Syrian military's offensive a massacre and called for the international community to intervene. Meanwhile the Assad government blames the rebels for the carnage in Qusayr and says it intervened because of pleas from the population. No matter who is at fault, Qusayr is completely destroyed -- a once peaceful community on the Syrian-Lebanese border that might never be restored again.","Pro-Assad forces re-took city on Lebanese border from the rebels .

"(CNN) -- Two years ago this week, the Obama administration hailed the advent of the ""Summer of Economic Recovery."" The president's stimulus bill had passed a Democratic-controlled Congress just over a year before, accompanied by rosy predictions on job creation from the administration. President Obama claimed that ""the economy is headed in the right direction,"" and Vice President Joe Biden confidently predicted the creation of 250,000 to 500,000 new jobs a month. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner published an op-ed in The New York Times boldly entitled ""Welcome to the Recovery."" Two years later, Americans are still waiting for the recovery. Today's job figures are well below the 250,000 to 500,000 jobs per month that Vice President Biden forecast. This year, the economy created a dismal 77,000 jobs in April and just 69,000 jobs in May, less than half of the 150,000 jobs needed each month just to keep up with population growth. Unemployment, which the White House predicted would shrink below 6% by April 2012, has remained at or above 8% for 40 straight months. It doesn't take an economist to realize the president's economic policies have spectacularly failed to make things better. Yet, the president doesn't seem to understand just how badly Americans are hurting. Despite the more than 23 million Americans who remain unemployed or underemployed, the president recently claimed that the private sector is ""doing fine"" and that what America actually needs is more government spending and more government workers. In other words, more of the same. More stimulus spending from Washington that explodes the debt. More government picking winners and losers. More taxes. More regulation. It's time to try something new. Republicans have a plan to get our economy moving again. First, we need to ensure businesses are confident enough to expand and hire more workers. That means stopping the job-killing regulations that are strangling small businesses and reforming our burdensome and complicated tax code to fuel economic growth. It also means stopping a large tax increase, which is scheduled to hit next year unless Congress acts. The threat of this massive tax hike is creating serious economic uncertainty and discouraging companies from hiring more workers. We can create tens of thousands of new American jobs by encouraging the development of America's vast energy resources and supporting truly shovel-ready projects like the Keystone XL pipeline, which would create an estimated 20,000 jobs, according to TransCanada, while boosting domestic energy production. We also need to protect jobs by repealing the president's health care law, which is driving up health care costs and making it harder for small businesses to hire workers. The director of the Congressional Budget Office testified that the health care law will mean 800,000 fewer jobs over the next decade. Those are jobs Americans can't afford to lose. Finally, we need to cut reckless government spending and tackle the mounting debt crisis. America's brightest days are ahead. But if we don't take action soon, our country could end up in the kind of financial disaster Greece and Spain are facing. Our children and grandchildren should not have to pay for Washington's inability to stick to a budget. We owe it to the next generation to leave the country better than we found it. The first step on the road to real recovery is not doubling down on the failed policies we've seen over the past 3Â½ years. Republicans are ready to get to work to jump-start our economy. We hope Democrats will join us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Thune.","John Thune: Two years ago this week, Obama claimed that economy will improve .

"(CNN) -- A Texas judge Friday denied Planned Parenthood's request to be included in the state's newly revamped women's health program. Judge Stephen Yelenosky said he denied the organization's request for a temporary injunction because it was unlikely Planned Parenthood would win at trial, since federal funds are not at issue in the case. ""If, as plaintiffs argue, a successor program must be Medicaid-funded then the only legal remedy would be for this court to shut down the state-funded women's health program, not to order the inclusion of Planned Parenthood,"" Judge Yelenosky wrote in the ruling. Texas lawmakers applauded the ruling. ""This is great news for Texas women and further proves that Planned Parenthood's case attempting to derail the Texas Women's Health Program lacks merit,"" Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement. He added that the injunction request was ""nothing more than a desperate move by an organization more concerned with obtaining taxpayer money than with helping women get care. With this ruling, our state can continue caring for Texas women,"" Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said he was pleased the agency would not ""skirt"" the law. ""The Texas Attorney General's office will continue to defend the Texas Legislature's decision to prohibit abortion providers and their affiliates from receiving taxpayer dollars through the Women's Health Program,"" Abbott's communications director, Lauren Bean, said. A state law that went into effect with the new year requires the state to fully fund women's health clinics with the exception of those that are affiliated with abortion providers. With that new law, Texas is no longer eligible for federal funding for women's health and, therefore, Planned Parenthood and other such establishments in the state will no longer be able to receive federal funding. Previously, such organizations in Texas obtained 90% of their money through the Social Security Administration and other federal funding. Late last month, a Texas judge denied the group's request for a temporary restraining order that would have extended the organization's ability to participate. Planned Parenthood and fellow plaintiff Marcela Balquinta of McAllen, Texas, filed the request for a temporary restraining order seeking exclusion from the new law, arguing the organization provides preventative women's health care not associated with abortions to nearly 50,000 Texas enrollees annually. The organization says more than 90% of the services its clinics provide are for preventative measures aimed towards cancer screenings, birth control and testing for diseases. ""Governor Rick Perry should not be able to decide which health centers a woman can go to for birth control, well-woman exams or cancer screenings,"" Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said. ""This case isn't about Planned Parenthood â€” it's about the women who rely on Planned Parenthood health centers for basic care every day. Ending funding for birth control, annual exams, or cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood would hurt the millions of American women and families that rely on Planned Parenthood health centers for health care,"" Richards added. ""That is why women and men in Texas and across the country strongly oppose attempts to deny funding to Planned Parenthood health centers, and will fight with us to ensure Planned Parenthood health center doors across America are open today and open tomorrow."" Late last month, a Texas judge denied the group's request for a temporary restraining order that would have extended the organization's ability to participate.","NEW: Judge says with no federal funds involved, Planned Parenthood doesn't have a case .

"(CNN) -- At least two of the five Egyptian diplomats kidnapped in Libya on Friday have been released, according to Egyptian and Libyan state news agencies. Egypt's agency, MENA, is quoting the Libyan Defense Minister Adel El-Faadey as saying that the remaining two will be released Monday. News from Libyan news agency LANA on Sunday said that five diplomats and an embassy worker were abducted. CNN is working to confirm the news about the embassy worker. LANA quotes an official source Sunday saying that two diplomats and the embassy staffer were released and arrived at their residence in Tripoli in good health. LANA also reported that a senior Libyan foreign ministry official met with the freed diplomats at their residence to check that they were OK. Gunmen carried out the kidnappings from the Egyptian Embassy in Tripoli. The embassy was evacuated Saturday. Libya's Justice Minister Salah al-Maghani stridently condemned the abductions and called for their freedom. A spokesman for the Libyan Foreign Ministry, Said Al-Aswad, earlier told the Egyptian MENA news agency that the motive behind the kidnapping was unknown and that Libyan authorities were investigating. On Saturday, the Libyan ambassador to Egypt said that the kidnappings could be in retaliation for the Friday arrest of Shaaban Hadiya in Alexandria, Egypt. Hadiya is also known as Abu Obedia El-Zawy and he heads the state-funded militia group Libyan Revolutionary Operations Room, or LROR. According to news sources, El-Zawy's group was responsible for the kidnapping of Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan last October. The Libyan General National Congress, which is drafting a new Libyan constitution, has demanded that Egyptian authorities release El-Zawy immediately. Earlier this week, a South Korean trade official was rescued after being taken from his car in Tripoli last Sunday. His kidnappers were detained, authorities said. Libya's government and fragile state security forces are struggling to impose law and order in a country awash with weapons left over from the 2011 war that ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian, Jomana Karadsheh, Leslie Holland and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","At least two of five Egyptian diplomats kidnapped in Libya have reportedly been released .

"(CNN) -- Anna Fenninger probably wishes every race was held on December 28th. The Austrian alpine skier won for the third straight time on that day, taking a women's giant slalom at home in Lienz. Fenninger overturned a 0.02-second first-run deficit Saturday to follow victories in a giant slalom in Lienz in 2011 and Semmering -- also in Austria -- in 2012. Sweden's Jessica Lindell-Vikarby finished 0.50 seconds behind Fenninger, with reigning slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S. a further 0.01 second adrift. ""I can't explain why I am successful on that specific day,"" Fenninger told the website of alpine skiing's governing body, the FIS. ""It's just amazing to win again. I have good memories of my fist victory here and it helps a bit for sure. ""I really love Lienz and the slope."" Fenninger moved into second place in the overall standings behind Tina Weirather, who was a distant 17th Saturday. ""I was a bit disappointed with my last giant slalom results,"" said Fenninger, on the podium for the first time in five giant slalom races this season. ""We had a lot of speed events recently and I didn't get much time to train my giant slalom skills. I didn't know I could be able to win today but I was ready to give it all. It is just great it turned out to be such a big day for me. ""Winning in front of a home crowd makes it very special for sure."" Lindell-Vikarby extended her advantage in the giant slalom standings. ""I am glad to be on the podium and to keep the giant slalom red bib,"" she said. ""In Val d'Isere (last week) I finished sixth and was a bit frustrated with myself because of the mistakes I made. Today was different. I am very happy.""

"(CNN) -- Austria has produced many of the world's greatest skiers, and another made her mark on the history books in front of her home crowd on Sunday. Marlies Schild claimed the 35th World Cup slalom victory of her career in Lienz to take sole ownership of the record from Switzerland's Vreni Schneider. It also put the 32-year-old behind only compatriot Annemarie Moser-Proll's 36 downhill titles for the most in any World Cup discipline. ""It is just amazing. I didn't really expect it after my first run that was far from perfect,"" said Schild, who was sixth after the opening leg. ""Even after crossing the finish line in the second run, my feeling wasn't that good. I thought that was not going to be enough for the win. The upper part didn't work out the way I wanted but I pushed in the lower section and it paid off."" It was the 2011 world champion's second successive slalom victory after topping the podium in the French Alps earlier this month. ""Tying the record in Courchevel took some pressure off,"" she said. ""But I was still very nervous today. It is always special to race at home. I am extremely happy right now."" American teenager Mikaela Shiffrin, who won the world title in February, followed up her third place in Saturday's giant slalom at the same venue by taking second ahead of Germany's Maria Hofl-Riesch. It kept the 18-year-old two points ahead of Schild in the slalom standings, while Hofl-Riesch now has the same advantage over previous leader Tina Weirather in the race for the overall World Cup title. Meanwhile, Aksel Lund Svindal moved 195 points clear in the men's World Cup with the 25th victory of his career in Sunday's downhill in Bormio. The Norwegian, third at the Italian course last year, finished 0.39 seconds ahead of Austria's defending champion Hannes Reichelt. Canada's Erik Guay, who won the last downhill in Val Gardena, was third. ""Bormio is a tough race. Usually it is decided on the last section; when everyone is tired you have to try and push that bit extra,"" Svindal said. ""I am going south to do some windsurfing and relax on the beach for four days over New Year's. I want to have some fun before the World Cup continues in January. It's healthy for me to walk barefoot on the beach and relax a bit after being in the cold all the time.""","Maria Schild wins a record 35th World Cup slalom race on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- A top U.S. diplomat known for her expertise in genocide arrived in the violence-wracked Central African Republic on Thursday to gauge the growing sectarian unrest there between Christians and Muslims. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is leading a delegation to Africa, first visiting the Central African Republic, and then off to Nigeria and Chad. She will be inquiring into whether crimes against humanity have been committed, she told CNN's Christiane Amanpour from the capital, Bangui. ""I don't think we even yet ... know the full scale of what has happened here in recent days, weeks and months,"" she said. ""But I certainly agree that what appear to be crimes against humanity have been committed."" Power cited how both sides of the conflict are responsible for the violence: the Muslim Seleka militias that overthrew the president earlier this year and the rival Christian groups that sprung up in retaliation. ""We met with one 20-year-old woman today who watched her husband get stabbed to death right in front of her,"" she said. He was ""then covered with kerosene and then lit on fire -- literally burned to a crisp before her very eyes."" That happened, she said, just last Thursday. Though the situation has calmed somewhat, Power still senses ""palpable fear on the ground and palpable mistrust,"" she said. An expert on the issue of U.S. politics and genocide, Power is well-positioned to understand and respond to the outbreak in violence. She authored "" 'A Problem from Hell,' America and the Age of Genocide."" That 2002 book examines the U.S. reactions to genocides. The Central African Republic has seen violence and chaos since the Muslim-backed Seleka militia and other rebel groups from the marginalized northeast seized the capital, Bangui, in March. President Francios Bozize fled to Cameroon, and Michel Djotodia, who had been one of the Seleka leaders, made himself President. The U.S. mission at the United Nations said Power is meeting with government, U.N., French and other officials ""to assess and support recent efforts of African Union and French forces to protect civilians, stabilize the country and restore humanitarian access."" In Nigeria and Chad, she'll be meeting with officials ""to discuss cooperation on a range of issues from promoting human rights and good governance to coordinating on regional security."" Nigeria and Chad are joining the U.N. Security Council as nonpermanent members in 2014. Power's delegation includes Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Linda Thomas-Greenfield. France has sent 1,600 troops under a U.N. mandate into Central African Republic to assist African troops. The United States, though not contributing troops, is using its airplanes to ferry in troops from across Africa. Former French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner offered an impassioned plea for intervention. ""Were we supposed to let them die? We were facing an eventual or the beginning of a bloodbath,"" he told CNN on Tuesday. ""I agree,"" Power said. ""It really could have descended very, very quickly into a bloodbath."" ""One of the reasons that the president asked me to take the trip here is to assess the situation up front, to try to look ahead and see what will be needed,"" Power said. It is important, Power added, that ""we walk and chew gum at the same time."" In other words, ""deal with the crisis at hand"" but also make sure that if ""it was deemed necessary to bring in a peacekeeping mission, that we be in a position to do that more quickly than otherwise,"" she said. A group of independent U.N. human rights experts urged all parties ""to pull back from the brink of all-out war with the terrible consequences that this entails and to establish an immediate truce to enable dialogue and peace talks to begin,"" they said in a statement. ""The current shocking violence in the Central African Republic threatens to descend into a full-scale sectarian conflict between Christian and Muslim communities, but it can and must be halted now,"" said the special rapporteurs, which are honorary, unpaid positions appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council. The surge of sectarian violence has been well-documented, and rights activists are urging quick and tough action to stop the violence. War crimes reported . Amnesty International said former rebels in the Central African Republic killed almost 1,000 people in a two-day rampage this month. War crimes and crimes against humanity are being committed in the country, Amnesty International said. ""Crimes that have been committed include extrajudicial executions, mutilation of bodies, intentional destruction of religious buildings such as mosques, and the forced displacement of massive numbers of people,"" said Christian Mukosa, Amnesty International's Central Africa expert. Djotodia later officially disbanded the Seleka, but as many as 15,000 kept their arms and instead continued to wreak havoc in Bangui and elsewhere. They mainly targeted Christian communities, which in turn formed their own vigilante group, the anti-balaka (literally ""anti-machete""). Anti-balaka forces staged an early morning attack in the capital on December 5, going door to door in some neighborhoods and killing approximately 60 Muslim men, Amnesty International said. De facto government forces, known as ex-Seleka, retaliated against Christians, killing nearly 1,000 men over a two-day period, according to the rights group. A small number of women and children also were killed. In a statement, Amnesty International called for the deployment of a ""robust"" U.N. peacekeeping force, with a mandate to protect civilians, and enough resources to do so effectively. ""The continuing violence, the extensive destruction of property, and the forced displacement of the population in Bangui are feeding enormous anger, hostility and mistrust,"" said Mukosa. ""There can be no prospect of ending the cycle of violence until the militias are disarmed and there is proper and effective protection for the thousands of civilians at risk in the country. Residential neighborhoods must be made safe as an urgent priority in order to allow people to go back to their homes and resume their normal lives."" Violence in Bossangoa . In a separate report, Human Rights Watch cited a surge in violence around the northern town of Bossangoa since September, adding that concerned countries should immediately bolster the African Union peacekeeping force in the country and support efforts by France to protect civilians. In the report, Human Rights Watch said Christian militias attacked Muslim communities, cutting the throats of children while forcing parents to watch. Muslim groups retaliated, setting fire to Christian homes and killing their occupants with the apparent approval of commanders present, Human Rights Watch said. The recent violence has created a humanitarian crisis. Both sides have burned down large swaths of villages in the northern Ouham province, the rights group said, adding that relief workers have found it difficult to provide help, particularly emergency medical aid, as aid workers have also been the targets of attacks. ""The brutal killings in the Central African Republic are creating a cycle of murder and reprisal that threatens to spin out of control,"" said Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. ""The UN Security Council needs to act quickly to bring this evolving catastrophe to a halt."" The Central African Republic is about the size of France and is rich in resources, including diamonds, gold, timber and ivory. The former French colony has rarely seen political stability or economic growth in the 53 years since it gained independence.

"(CNN) -- Russia will host a Formula One race for the first time in 2014, its Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced on Thursday. A seven-year deal has been agreed to host the race at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, running through to the 2020 season. The city will also host the 2014 Winter Olympics. ""We have reached an agreement with the principal owner of Formula One that Sochi would host the Russian Grand Prix from 2014 to 2020,"" former President Putin told Russian business leaders, as quoted by state news agency RIA Novosti. Formula One surpremo Bernie Ecclestone also confirmed Russia's imminent introduction to the elite motorsport category's calendar. ""I am very happy that Formula One will take place in Russia,"" he told the UK Press Association. ""I hope that Formula One will contribute to the development of Sochi which can be seen here."" Russian motorsport commentator Alexei Popov has hailed hosting a grand prix as one of the biggest events in sport. ""Such an ambitious project became possible only due to the political will of high-profile officials,"" he told business newspaper Vedomosti. ""After the Olympic Games and the World Cup, this is the most spectacular sports event."" The sport has been keen to expand into new regions in recent years, with Korea making its F1 debut later this month and India being added to the racing calendar for the 2011 season. The new race could lead to the creation of Russia's first F1 team, according to Igor Yermilin of the Russian Motor Racing Federation. ""The signing of the agreement to stage a Grand Prix in Sochi will help put a Russian team in F1,"" he told RIA Novosti. Vitaly Petrov this year became the first Russian to drive in F1 after securing a race seat with the Renault team. The 26-year-old, who signed a one-year deal with the option of two more, is 13th in the drivers' standings on 19 points -- 95 behind Polish teammate Robert Kubica.","Russia to host its first Formula One race in Sochi starting in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- It was a penalty shootout that summed up Manchester United's season -- errant, careless and ultimately forlorn. This was the team that have dominated English football for years, one of the biggest on the planet. Yet here they were, slugging it out from the penalty spot with lowly Sunderland in the semifinal of the English League Cup, with a place at Wembley at stake. Usually so composed in pressure situations, United's players blinked, four of them missing from 12 yards out as this interminable season took another turn for the worse. Since Sunderland last won silverware in 1973, Manchester United have won 25 domestic trophies, but before the end of January the only competition they are still in with a realistic chance of winning is the European Champions League. Yet the man who presided over the majority of those 25 trophies -- Alex Ferguson -- has gone and the man who had replaced him is looking more beleaguered by the day. David Moyes trudged off the field as Sunderland players swarmed around their goalkeeper Vito Mannone, who saved the penalty that sent them to the final of England's second most prestigious cup competition. They will now face Manchester CIty in the final on March 2 while United, and Moyes especially, will face more intense questioning about the direction his club is going in. ""Criticism is fair if you don't win at this football club,"" Moyes told Sky Sports after the game. ""Credit to Sunderland -- they played well and we didn't. We've played well in a lot of games this season and not got the rewards but we didn't deserve any rewards tonight. ""When we had the chances to get a second goal we didn't finish it off. I've got no problem them getting through -- they deserved it."" In the end, United were fortunate to force the game into penalties after goalkeeper David De Gea fumbled a shot from Phil Bardsley into the net -- a gaffe that appeared to have handed Sunderland victory in the final seconds of the game. Luckily for the Spanish keeper, just 60 seconds later a dramatic goal from Javier Hernandez with practically the last kick of the match gave United one last shot at redemption. One which they couldn't take. Of De Gea's mistake Moyes said: ""David's been really good this season. People do make mistakes but it was a costly one. That's football and that's the way it is just now."" Of the four missed penalties from his side Moyes simply added: ""That was poor. I would expect better."" Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, United took the lead on 37 minutes through Jonny Evans to level the scores on aggregate. But with no more goals at the end of 90 minutes the match went into extra time. Knowing they needed to score to go through Sunderland piled men forward in search of a winner but no-one at Old Trafford could have been prepared for the tumult that was to come. Phil Bardsley, who spent five years as a Manchester United player, fired in a low shot from outside the box that De Gea found too hot to handle. As Sunderland's players celebrated in front of their 9,000 traveling fans, Moyes rolled his eyes as the prospect of a Wembley final ebbed away. But just over 60 seconds later it was United's fans celebrating as Hernandez turned in a cross to lock the scores up on aggregate and send the tie to penalties. With the tension around the stadium palpable, the first three players to take spot kicks missed, before Darren Fletcher put Manchester United 1-0 up. But that was the only success United would register from 12 yards as successful penalties from Marcos Alonso and Ki Sung-Yueng put Sunderland 2-1 in front, either side of an Adnan Januzaj miss. Phil Jones was the next player to go wide, ballooning his effort over the bar, before Sunderland's Adam Johnson squandered the opportunity to settle the tie. All of which meant Rafael had to score to keep United in the match, but his spot kick was saved by Mannone, sparking wild scenes of celebration from the visitors. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet, who is battling to keep his side in the Premier League, told Sky Sports: ""This feeling is for the fans. It has been a difficult season but look at them now, this is for them. ""To have a day of football like today is great for everybody and great for football. It is a great story -- let's see if we can go one better. ""The things that happened today were incredible but the players were outstanding, they are trying hard to learn so credit to them.""","Manchester United knocked out of English League Cup by lowly Sunderland .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- In the busy street markets of Kabul, stacks of cash sit in piles as moneychangers shout the day's exchange rate to shoppers bustling by. Currency is bought and sold in the open air. But all the money changing hands on the streets is barely a drop in the bucket compared to all the cash being siphoned out of the country in suitcases, and that is not a metaphor. ""It's hard to estimate exactly how much is going out of Afghanistan, but I can tell you in 2011, 4.5 billion was (flown) out of Afghanistan,"" said Khan Afzal Hadawal, deputy governor of the bank of Afghanistan. That is just what is moving out of the Kabul airport. It is estimated $8 billion in cash was lugged out of the country last year by car, private jets and border crossings. That is almost double the entire country's budget for 2011. The government is trying to stop the outflow of money to other countries and encourage investment in Afghanistan. It has capped the amount of cash that can be taken out of the country at $20,000. ""We are very serious on this. It is not an easy job. Definitely there are challenges. People will try to use other channels but we will not let anybody take the physical cash out of Afghanistan,"" Hadawal said. Military: Bales left base twice during rampage . At a dusty construction site on the outskirts of Kabul, workers use everything from a hand-powered rebar cutter to a huge tractor and loader. They are building a multimillion-dollar community. It is the dream of Afghan developer Haji Hafizullah Caravan, who hopes the government's plan works. He and his family have made a huge investment in the capital, Kabul, constructing large self-contained communities complete with mosques, schools and hospitals. The idea is to make people feel safer by creating a tiny city within a city. The price per apartment starts at $70,000. ""Kabul was mostly destroyed in wars. There is need for construction in Afghanistan and the amount of housing that is needed is not being fulfilled,"" Caravan said. The projects have created dozens of jobs for people like Abdul Wahab, who has 13 family members to provide for. ""It's hard to find work and to find good work,"" Wahab said after using all his body weight and strength to lean on a lever linked to a device that cuts rebar. If it wasn't for this job, he said, his family would suffer greatly. Caravan said he wants others to help rebuild instead of storing their cash in already posh Dubai. ""We are Afghans and should build up our own country by any means. We should be proud of our country,"" he said. But he said he understands why people have moved out large sums of cash. There is a looming fear that when NATO forces leave, so will any semblance of security, both physical and economic. Three NATO soldiers killed . ""We are worried about security, that it doesn't get worse. We want a stable system here in Afghanistan after foreign troops' withdrawal. We worry about this and nothing else,"" Caravan said. The 10-year war has brought heartache, but also more stability. Foreign aid is propping up Afghanistan's economy. The question on every potential investor's mind is whether Afghanistan will be able to sustain itself when the war is finally over.","It is estimated $8 billion in cash was lugged out of Afghanistan last year .
The country limits cash leaving the country at once to $20,000 .

"(CNN) -- Russia's anti-gay laws are ""no problem whatsoever,"" according to a leading Olympic official. Lamine Diack, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, has called for Russian law to be respected ahead of his sport's world championships, which begin in Moscow on Saturday. Russian President Vladimir Putin last month signed into effect a law which bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear. It has been condemned by Russian and international rights groups as highly discriminatory. ""I don't feel there is a problem whatsoever,"" Diack, a member of the International Olympic Committee, told reporters. ""Russia has their laws. Each athlete can have their own private life, so we won't call upon people about this and that. ""This law has to be respected. We are here for the World Championships and have no problem whatsoever and I'm not worried at all."" The new laws have led to calls for the 2014 Winter Olympics, set to be held in the city of Sochi, to be taken away from Russia. A 320,000-signature petition protesting the country's stance on gay rights ahead of the Games was presented to Olympic bosses in Switzerland on Wednesday. Responding to the petition, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge reaffirmed the Olympic movement's commitment to freedom of expression. ""The Olympic charter is clear. A sport is a human right and it should be available to all, regardless of race, sex or sexual orientation,"" said Rogge in a statement. "" As far as the freedom of expression is concerned, of course, this is something that is important."" According to the IOC's statement, the Russian government has confirmed the new legislation will not apply to athletes and tourists during the Games. ""This legislation has just been passed into law and it remains to be seen whether and how it will be implemented, particularly as regards the Games in Sochi. ""As a sporting organization, what we can do is to continue to work to ensure that the Games can take place without discrimination against athletes, officials, spectators and the media. ""To that end, the IOC has received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games."" Rogge's words were welcomed by All Out, the gay rights group which delivered the petition to the IOC's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. ""This is the strongest and most direct statement we have received from the IOC,""All Out co-founder and executive director Andre Banks said in a statement. ""It shows the IOC is listening to the global outcry against these laws and demanding real answers, not propaganda, from the Russian government. ""When he mentions the importance of freedom of expression, Rogge is right. Fundamental freedoms are eroded for all Russians -- gay and straight -- under these laws. ""Pierre de Coubertin created the Games with the dream of 'changing the world through sport'. In that spirit, we are calling for the IOC to clearly denounce the anti-gay law and do everything in its power to see that it is removed before the Olympics."" Russia's sports minister Vitaly Mutko, speaking at the same press conference as Diack, urged journalists to ""calm down"" before defending the new law. ""In addition to this law, we have a constitution that guarantees all rights to private life,"" insisted Mutko. ""This law is not intended to deprive any people of any religion, of any race, of any sexual orientation, but to ban the promotion of non-traditional relations among the younger generations. ""All sports athletes and organizations should be relaxed. All their rights will be protected. ""You have to respect the laws of the country you are coming to. This is a sports festival and we only have to talk about it."" U.S. President Barack Obama spoke out on the issue on Tuesday's Jay Leno show, condemning the laws as against the spirit of the Olympics. ""I've been very clear that when it comes to universal rights, when it comes to people's basic freedoms, that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, you are violating the basic morality that I think should transcend every country,"" said Obama. Obama this week canceled a one-on-one meeting with Putin which had been scheduled for September. The reason given by the White House was Russia's decision to grant asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and ""lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control,"" while also mentioning human rights issues. World Sport Presents: An uneven playing field . In June Obama visited Diack's native Senegal, where homosexuality is illegal. Obama called for all African citizens to be treated equally, but Senegal's president Macky Sall insisted the country is ""not ready"" to decriminalize homosexuality. British broadcaster Stephen Fry penned an open letter to his country's prime minister David Cameron, International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge and London 2012 chief Sebastian Coe calling for the Games to be taken away from Russia. There has been a groundswell of international concern over the anti-gay propaganda law and its potential impact on visitors to Russia for the Games. Protests have ranged from a number of bars around the world announcing a boycott of Russian vodka to calls from some quarters for a boycott of the Games themselves. However, some gay athletes insist the Games must go ahead in Sochi. ""I'm fully against a boycott,"" New Zealand speed skater Blake Skjellerup told CNN. ""The Olympics have been very important to me and I know that a lot of people like myself have worked very hard for these Games. ""It's very important for the world to show up in Sochi and be united in this issue, to bring light to and start a conversation about what is going on."" U.S. figure skater Johnny Weir, who is married to a Russian-American man, says the flamboyant nature of his sport means that he can make a stance in Sochi. ""I'm quite well known in Russia so my sheer presence is a big statement against this anti-propaganda law,"" he told CNN. Former Olympic diving champion Greg Louganis says it is difficult to balance the sporting desires of athletes with the need to make a political point against the Russian law. ""Boycotts hurt the wrong people, they hurt the athletes, but we can't ignore what's going on in Sochi,"" said the American, who missed the 1980 Moscow Olympics due to a boycott and was also affected by Eastern European retaliation in snubbing the 1984 Los Angeles Games. ""It's a birthright to pursue love and not be incarcerated for loving and wanting to find love,"" he told CNN.","IAAF president Lamine Diack has ""no problem whatsoever"" with Russia's anti-gay law .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- An Indian fast-track court on Monday began hearing the case of five men charged in the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi, the latest step in a case that has appalled and transfixed India. The five adult suspects in the December 16 incident appeared at the hearing. But details about what was said in court cannot be reported under a judge's ruling imposing restrictions on coverage of the case. The suspects are alleged to have attacked the woman and her male companion on a bus, robbed them and dumped them by the side of the road. The woman, badly injured in the attack, died two weeks later despite being flown to Singapore for treatment. Her companion survived. The five men are charged with murder, rape and kidnapping and could face the death penalty if convicted. A sixth suspect, who is believed to be too young to be tried as an adult, is facing proceedings in a juvenile court. Indian rape debate: Why death penalty is no solution . The case is being heard in a ""fast-track"" court, which India introduced to try to expedite cases in a justice system bogged down by red tape. It means sessions of the trial, once it begins, should take place nearly every working day until a verdict is reached. The hearing Monday was a procedural step at which the charge sheet detailing prosecutors' accusations against the suspects was submitted. The trial will begin once the prosecution's arguments are made in court. The next hearing is scheduled for Thursday, according to defense lawyers. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court is due to hear a plea from the lawyer of one of the accused to shift the trial outside of New Delhi. The magistrates' court that initially heard the case imposed restrictions on what the news media can report about events in court. That practice is common in rape cases in India, and the magistrate said it was also necessary to protect the suspects' safety amid intense media coverage and widespread anger. The case has prompted rallies in cites across India and an uproar over the treatment of women. Authorities have not released the name of the woman, but Indian protesters have been calling her Damini, which means ""lightning"" in Hindi. ""Damini"" is also a 1993 Bollywood film whose lead female character fights for a housemaid, a victim of sexual assault. The government has pledged to strengthen laws against sexual assaults after the outrage over the case. The events have also focused the attention of the Indian news media on attacks against women around the huge country. Newspapers and television stations have been reporting other shocking rape allegations on an almost daily basis. The number of reported rapes in India -- a country where a cultural stigma keeps many victims from reporting the crime -- has increased from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011, according to official figures. Most women in India have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, the Indian Council on Global Relations says.

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Half a mile underground, the hollow echo of the Chilean national anthem rings out. And slowly, the red, white and blue Chilean flag is hoisted up a makeshift metal flagpole. These are the opening images of a new, nine-minute video the 33 miners sent Saturday from the cavern where they're trapped 700 meters (2,300 feet) down. They were putting a brave face on disaster to celebrate Chile's Independence Day in their own way. It was left to Bolivian Carlos Mamani, the only one of the men who is not Chilean, to record an Independence Day message. ""I would like to send a special message to Chilean President Sebastian Pinera for helping us all in this difficult time. I would also like to send a message of thanks to Bolivian President Evo Morales who has been supporting my family,"" said Mamani, originally from the Bolivian mining town of Oruro. At one point in the video, Mario Sepulveda waves a white towel in one hand and his miner's helmet in the other and demonstrates some nimble footwork as he dances Chile's national folk dance known as the ""cueca."" Other miners clap and music plays from one of the MP3 players rescuers have sent into the mine to entertain the men. Sepulveda jigs around in lightweight rubber boots, a red T-shirt and blue shorts -- items of clothing that were sent down to him and the other miners via an 8-cm (4 inch) borehole nicknamed the ""umbilical chord."" The hole was drilled into the mineshaft after they were discovered alive on August 22. Since then, all emergency supplies, including food, water and clothing, are sent down the narrow shafts. The San Jose mine, in the northern Atacama Desert, caved in on August 5 and the men were initially feared dead. Prior to the accident, Sepulveda's job was to drive a backhoe, known as a ""scoop,"" inside the mine. Since then, he has emerged as a quick-witted joker and has taken the role of narrator in the videos the miners have sent to the surface -- recounting their plight with good spirits and humor. At one point, the video shows a live news broadcast projected onto the wall of the cavern where the miners have been holed up and which they have dubbed ""Refuge 33."" The news show covered Independence Day celebrations across Chile. The miners now have permanent communication with rescuers on the surface via a telephone line and a fiber-optic cable for video-conferencing. A TV signal can be piped into the mine and run through a handheld projector, which beams out a 21-inch image. As a special Independence Day treat, the miners were given a menu of traditional Chilean ""empanadas,"" a pastry filled with a mixture of meat, onions, olives and raisins. The video showed them receiving the ""empanadas"" vacuum-sealed in a plastic wrapper and dispatched from the surface in a metal cylinder rescue workers call the ""carrier pigeon."" On the surface, the miners' families continue to wait in a makeshift tent village at the mine entrance called Camp Hope. Many organized cook-outs -- a typical part of Independence Day celebrations -- and barbecued ribs, filet steak and chicken wings. But the family of trapped miner Victor Zamora said they had little to celebrate this year. ""We're sad because Independence Day is a family day and we used to go for a walk with my baby in our favorite park,"" said Zamora's wife, Yesica Cortes. ""But today we're sad."" Inside, Zamora's mother Nelly Bugueno prepared broth and chopped salad. She said she was sure the miners were just putting on a show for the camera in the videos they had recently sent to the surface. She said she believed they were depressed and distraught by their plight. ""Victor's pain is my pain,"" Bugueno said. ""For me, there's nothing to celebrate. It's just that Victor asked us to be together this day. As long as they are underground, there's nothing to celebrate. We'll celebrate independence when they come out."" Zamora, who has a 4-year-old son Arturo, has emerged as the poet among the 33 trapped miners. He has composed rhymes praising the rescue workers and the valor of his fellow miners. ""He's discovered something beautiful down there,"" his mother said. ""He writes letters likes poems."" ""I guess he's discovered that talent because he was was in pain being so far from his loved ones,"" wife Cortes said. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera is scheduled to visit the San Jose mine and inspect rescue operations Sunday. As evening fell Saturday, three military helicopters overflew the mine in what government officials said was a ""practice run"" for Sunday's presidential visit. Sources among the rescue workers said Pinera may mark his visit by flipping the switch on a powerful oil drill that has been transported to the mine to assist in the rescue. The Canadian-owned Rig 421 drill has been assembled but not yet begun drilling. Mine experts say that the drill -- known as Plan C -- could be the fastest way of punching a hole through rock that is wide enough to hoist the miners back to the surface. However, two other drills, a Schramm T-130 (Plan B) normally used for boring water holes and a Raise Borer Strata 950 (Plan A) normally used for drilling ventilation chimneys in mines have been operating for around three weeks. On Friday, the Schramm T-130 reached a depth of 623 meters (2,044 feet) and penetrated the roof of the workshop area close to the miners' shelter. However, the shaft is only about 12 inches wide and the drill must make a second pass to widen the hole to a maximum 28-inches (70 cm). The Chilean government says the miners could be rescued by late October or early November, an improvement on earlier predictions that the operation could take until Christmas.","Miners put a brave face on a disaster in its 44th day .

"(CNN) -- Asiana Airlines will not pursue a lawsuit against a Bay Area TV station for allegedly damaging the company's image by reporting erroneous and offensive names of the pilots in the recent crash at San Francisco International Airport. The company said Wednesday it wouldn't file a suit after KTVU offered an official apology. The bogus names, which phonetically spelled out phrases such as ""Something Wrong"" and ""We Too Low,"" were read during KTVU's noon broadcast Friday. The airline called the report ""demeaning"" and said it was ""reviewing possible legal action."" The Asiana 777 fell short of its approach and crashed on the runway at the airport on July 6. Three people were killed and more than 180 others were hurt. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. The early stage of the investigation has focused heavily on the actions of the crew during the landing attempt. Asiana jokes: Racist or just bad taste? Over the weekend, the Korean airline had said it would sue the NTSB and the station after an intern at the NTSB mistakenly confirmed ""inaccurate and offensive"" names as those of the pilots. But at the beginning of the week, the airline seemed to have a change of heart. A spokesman said the company didn't have plans to file a separate suit against the NTSB. The agency apologized for the ""inaccurate and offensive"" names, which it said were erroneously confirmed by a summer intern. A government official with knowledge of the situation said Monday the intern is no longer with the agency. As for KTVU, in Oakland, anchor Tori Campbell read the names Friday. The news station, a CNN affiliate, later apologized on air and on its website. But the airline continued to move ahead with a defamation claim against the TV station until the Wednesday announcement. Ken Paulson, president of the First Amendment Center and the dean of the College of Mass Communication at Middle Tennessee State University, said ""it's very difficult to conceive of a defamation suit prevailing here."" The key to such a case is to determine whether what was said damages an entity's reputation and causes injury, and what care was taken, if any, to prevent that, he told CNN. Passengers begin legal action against Boeing . ""Everyone who heard this understood it was a prank. And as ludicrous as the report was, at least the news station made a call to try to check,"" he said. Paulson notes that the real names of pilots were not given in the news report. ""Where is the real damage? Yes, it was tasteless and undoubtedly it caused some short-term emotional distress, but nothing that rises to the level of litigation,"" he said. It was not immediately clear who produced the fake names, but the NTSB said it was not the intern. ""The names were presented, by the station, to the intern for confirmation,"" NTSB spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. ""The intern did not make up the names and provide them to the station."" The NTSB said it does not release or confirm the identities of crew members or other people involved in transportation accidents.","KTVU is a local station based in Oakland, California .

"(CNN) -- Six-time former major champion Nick Faldo said that big questions surrounding the future of Tiger Woods still remain despite the world No. 1 apologizing for his ""irresponsible and selfish behavior"" in a public statement on Friday. The apology from Woods -- which was broadcast around the world from the headquarters of the PGA Tour in Florida -- was the first public statement from the golfer since the 34-year-old admitted to ""transgressions"" following a Thanksgiving car crash. However, in an exclusive interview with CNN, Faldo said the comments had done little to answer key questions: ""It was a pretty complete apology and very embarrassing for him, to take the world stage and to apologize for what he has been up to."" ""However, he still left the big question that we as golfers all wanted to know, and that's when he will come back to the course. Tiger has only delayed the hard questions that will surely follow . ""Instead he's decided to head back to therapy -- which I find difficult to understand as this man had an extremely strong mind on the the golf course. ""I assume he's paying the bill as I can't believe that a man in a white coat would be telling Tiger what to do,"" Faldo added. Faldo, who won the U.S. Masters on three occasions, added that Tiger faced a ""long road"" back to the top of the game. ""He is the center of attention -- there's so much talk and gossip behind his back [now], none of it very pretty. To come back now knowing that so many people are talking behind his back ... it will take a long road [as] he's asking for the world to like him again. ""He seems like he is going to put the barriers up -- he wants it completely private.  All the leading PR experts would say that he needs to face the music and you need to get it over and done with, but Tiger wants it his way. But the bottom line is it stills looks like a long road to get him back on the golf course."" Golf.com: Players react positively . Nike, a major Woods sponsor, reacted to his remarks with the following statement: ""Tiger has apologized and made his position clear. Nike fully supports him and his family. We look forward to him returning to golf."" Elsewhere, PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem told CNN that Woods' words contained a message of good news after some months of bad headlines. ""The good news from today is that one, he plans to return to golf; two, it could be by the end of the year, and three, he's taking the right steps to return. All of that pleases us a great deal."" In response to the criticism Woods faced over refusing to take questions at the press conference, Finchem said: . ""I don't know the extent to which the media will allow him the opportunity to return in the way he wants. Hopefully we can maintain the decorum we have had at our tournament in the past, and we'd ask golf fans to react positively to his requests."" Fellow golfer John Daly sent his message of reaction via his Twitter account: ""The biggest major Tiger is going to win now -- is going to keep his family and I hope he succeeds! I wish him all the best! JD."" Earlier in the day, Spanish golfer Sergio Garcia said in a press conference at the WGC Accenture Match play in Arizona: ""I'm looking forward to seeing him back on the tour, seeing him play, that's what we love doing. Other than that, I'm not really worried about the rest."" Fellow European and world No. 11 Ian Poulter agreed: ""The sooner he comes out to tell us all when he's going to be coming back to play golf -- great.

"ATHENS, Greece (CNN)   -- The wildfires that have scorched southern Greece, killing dozens of people, reached the ancient city of Olympia, birthplace of the Olympic games, an official said Sunday. Smoke rises Sunday in ancient Olympia, close to the archaeological site in western Peloponnese, Greece. The city is ""in danger,"" said fire department spokeswoman Janis Stamoulis, explaining that the flames are encroaching on an old museum and archaeological center. None of the city's historical sites has been destroyed, she said. Officials said Sunday they have arrested and charged two individuals in connection with the fires that have razed dozens of villages and killed at least 51 people, Fire Brigade Officer Nikos Tsogas said Sunday.  Watch how the death toll continues to rise » . One of the individuals is a 65-year-old man, who witnesses said they saw torching areas in the southern Peloponnese region near the town of Areopolis, located 190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Athens.  Map » . The second person was a 77-year-old woman who reportedly started a fire while cooking in her garden in Zaharo, one of the hardest hit areas in the south. Tsogas said authorities are deeming her behavior criminal neglect. Meanwhile, officials are also investigating a gas canister explosive device found attached to a cell phone on the outskirts of Athens. About 30 meters away rags drenched in petrol were found underneath parched brush and twigs, Tsogas said. Witness reports indicate two ""suspicious"" individuals were seen near the site. Tsogas said authorities were treating the case seriously. Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis declared a nationwide state of emergency Saturday night, mobilizing all resources.  View photos from the blaze and aftermath » . In a nationally televised address, Karamanlis suggested the blazes might have been deliberately set by political extremists ahead of next month's national elections. The fires have placed a damper on campaigning. ""So many fires sparked simultaneously in so many places is no coincidence,"" Karamanlis said, vowing to punish those responsible. No one has the right to take human lives and destroy the environment, he added. He described the situation as a ""battle that has to be won"" and ordered all resources mobilized to fight the fire. Many firefighters said they are suspicious of the fire's source, given several witness reports that the blazes cropped up simultaneously along a 20-kilometer (12-mile) front of lush greenery in southern Greece. Scores of people have been hospitalized with severe burns and respiratory problems, state-run television reported. As of Sunday a total of 45 villages have been evacuated in the parched southern region and at least three villages north of Athens. Efforts to temper the flames have been stymied due to the sweltering heat wave gripping the area, which has left forests and scrubland parched. That, coupled with strong winds fanning the flames, have led authorities to call this the country's worst fire season on record. Since June more than 3,000 fires have razed thousands of hectares of forests and scrubland across the country -- nearly triple last year's total -- according to officials. Heavy smoke billowing Saturday afternoon above Mount Hymettus southeast of Athens signaled that a new fire had broken out. The worst-hit area stretched for 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the western towns of the Zaharo, within the highlands of the western Peloponnese, to the southern tip of the peninsula, Mani. A mother, her child and at least seven other people died while trying to flee a burning, wooded area in the mountainous villages in the western Peloponnese, near the town of Zaharo, according to a fire brigade official. Farther south, six people -- including two French tourists found by rescue crews in an embrace -- were killed in a forest fire that swept near their hotel in the town of Areopolis, located 190 km (120 miles) southwest of Athens. Greece's elections are set for September 16. The ruling party has called for a temporary suspension of political campaigning as a sign of respect to those who died in the flames, and flags on government buildings were flying at half staff Saturday. The modern Olympics began in 1896, but the ancient games can be traced to 776 B.C. The games were staged on the plains of Olympia for 12 centuries until 393 A.D. when Emperor Theodosius issued a ban on ""pagan cults,"" according to the International Olympic Committee.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- A British private security firm is denying claims its employees administered electric shocks and injected inmates with anti-psychotic drugs at a maximum security prison it ran in South Africa. The claims came to light through Ruth Hopkins, a human rights investigator with the Wits University Justice Project, who said she started her probe after receiving dozens of letters detailing abuse at the Mangaung Correctional Centre near Bloemfontein, in the central part of the country. Leaked videos also made their way to Hopkins, including one in which she says the sound of electric shocks can be heard, and someone screaming in excruciating pain. The security company, G4S, told CNN it does not use any form of torture or shock treatment, and that G4S staff and Mangaung Correctional services do not administer medication nor have access to it. G4S insists only independent, certified medical staff administer medications, not G4S security personnel. ""The role of G4S staff is to prevent prisoners who are being treated from causing harm to other prisoners and staff. This is in accordance with the relevant legal guidelines,"" the company said in a statement on its website Monday. A representative for the company said the allegations are being taken very seriously and the company would be launching its own investigation into the matter. The South African government is also investigating the actions of G4S and the independent medical team based at the prison. The results of that probe could come as early as Friday. Although it no longer runs the facility, G4S said in its statement there is ""an active and independent inspection regime in place at the Mangaung prison, and there have never been any allegations or concerns regarding anything of this nature."" Hopkins told CNN that her investigation also revealed ""that the prison was also forcibly injecting these inmates with anti-psychotic medication, according to the accounts of the inmates."" One video leaked to Hopkins shows uniformed G4S employees holding down a struggling inmate as he is given an injection. ""I am not an animal!"" he is heard screaming. Hopkins said a health care worker reported that a certified medical staffer who is not a G4S employee gave the inmate an anti-psychotic drug despite no record of psychosis. The videos were shot by G4S employees themselves. According to its contract with the South African government, the security team is obligated to document its actions and only allowed to use force under strict guidelines. The company says it cannot verify the authenticity of the videos and strongly denies all allegations of mistreatment at the prison, which houses 3,000 inmates and is the second-largest private prison in the world, according to G4S. Documents obtained by Hopkins suggest the problems at the prison have been going on for some time. In 2010, a Department of Correctional Services employee filed a classified memo to his superiors stating that the ""state is being milked for work not done"" and that the company uses ""the cheapest methods"" at the prison, describing the use of electric shock as routine. More than 300 G4S employees at the prison went on strike earlier this month, complaining of being ill-equipped and understaffed. The company responded by firing hundreds of them, which was followed by more violence at the notorious prison. The government ended up firing the firm, saying it had ""lost effective control over the facility."" GS4 has contracts across the globe, including with U.S. Customs, Baghdad International Airport security, the Wimbledon tennis championships and dozens of red-carpet events. But it's not the first time the company has come under scrutiny. GS4 won the lucrative London Olympics contract to provide security staff for events, but wasn't able to perform all its duties, forcing the British government to call in additional troops to secure the games.","The Mangaung Correctional Centre houses 3,000 violent offenders .

"(CNN) -- Peanut butter makers not affected by the deadly salmonella outbreak linked to a Georgia peanut plant are trying to get consumers to keep buying peanut butter. It could be an uphill battle. J.M. Smucker Co. wants to assure consumers that its Jif brand of peanut butter is safe to eat. Companies such as ConAgra Foods Inc. and J.M. Smucker Co. have started running ads and offering coupons, trying to lure peanut butter customers as sales have plunged at least 20 percent since the salmonella outbreak. Eight people have died and nearly 600 have been sickened in the outbreak. The original peanut butter recall launched weeks ago has expanded to include more than 1,000 products. On ConAgra's Web site, a letter assures customers that the company's peanut butter is safe. ""ConAgra Foods, the maker of Peter Pan Peanut Butter, has confirmed that none of the ingredients used to make Peter Pan Peanut Butter come from Peanut Corporation of America, the company linked to the government's current salmonella investigation,"" the letter says. ""We are extremely confident in the safety protocols."" J.M. Smucker, maker of Jif peanut butter, had a similar message for customers. ""Our Smucker's peanut butter brand and peanut butter products are safe for consumption. The J.M. Smucker Company does not purchase peanuts or any ingredients from Peanut Corporation of America,"" its Web site says. The Peanut Corporation of America is under investigation by the Food and Drug Administration, and the FBI searched its Blakely, Georgia, plant on Monday, CNN affiliate WALB-TV in Albany, Georgia, reported. Americans have shied away from peanut butter despite the FDA's assurances that major-label peanut butter in grocery stores is safe.  Watch a senator express outrage at the outbreak » . ""With eight dead and almost 600 sick, it's a time to be prudent,"" said Dr. Douglas Powell, an associate professor of food safety at Kansas State University, which is the home of the International Food Safety Network. There's another problem, Powell said: ""None of these companies are really coming out and saying this is what we do to ensure safety. They say, 'Yeah, we test for salmonella.' But are those tests public? They're not."" Shoppers are wary because they don't know which products are safe, he said. Tainted peanut butter and peanut paste were shipped by Peanut Corporation of America to institutions such as schools, nursing homes and prisons, not to grocery stores. But that isn't preventing consumers from playing it safe. Powell said he understands. ""If you're a parent packing a lunch and you have all the hectic things going on in the morning, is it really realistic to say, hey, before you put that peanut snack cracker individually wrapped item into your kid's lunch, you're going to go onto the Internet and check a Web site? I think that's a bit much. I think it's prudent to avoid this stuff until we see where this is going,"" he said.","Makers of Peter Pan and Jif distance firms from salmonella contamination .

"Washington (CNN)  -- Comedian Bill Cosby received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor on Monday after refusing to accept the award twice in the past. Cosby, known for his clean acts that do not include profanity, declined the previous prizes because he was turned off by language used at the first Mark Twain Prize ceremony in 1998 honoring the late comedian Richard Pryor. ""I made it clear that there were certain people who misunderstood what Richard was about and how they were using words, ""Cosby said. 'And I was not about to have that celebrating Mark Twain and Bill Cosby."" Cosby accepted this year after the Kennedy Center promised not to repeat ""the foolishness at Richard Pryor's celebration,"" Cosby said. Stars including comedians Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld, musicians Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis and ""The Cosby Show"" co-stars Phylicia Rashad and Malcolm-Jamal Warner helped honor Cosby during the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Comedian Sinbad, who is also known for his clean comedy acts, said Cosby showed him that comedy without foul language could still have ""bite."" ""[Bill] Cosby showed me that a person could be clean and make money and be effective,"" Sinbad said. ""Bill Cosby is one of the greatest comedians this country has ever produced,"" said comedian Carl Reiner, a past Mark Twain Prize recipient. Cosby's career spans more than four decades. He started out performing stand-up comedy in small clubs in Greenwich Village in New York. He eventually landed a pivotal co-starring role in the 1960s television series ""I Spy."" One of his best-known roles was as Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable on the 1980s sitcom ""The Cosby Show"" The show portrayed an upper-middle-class African-American family and is credited with helping revive NBC's fortunes and for blazing a path for other shows featuring African-Americans. ""How far I could go had barriers in front of it. And it is because of civil rights, because of the winning of the people of all color ... we're here today,"" Cosby said. ""I just feel like a master. I feel good. And I'm comfortable."" The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor is awarded to performers who use comedy to influence American society. Past recipients include George Carlin, Billy Crystal, Steve Martin and Whoopi Goldberg. The event is scheduled to air on PBS on November 4.","Mark Twain Prize is awarded to performers who use comedy to influence society .

"(CNN) -- Didier Defago is hitting form just at the right time. The reigning Olympic downhill champion produced a storming run in the Super-G on Kitzbuehel's famous Hahnenkamm mountain on Sunday to claim only the fourth World Cup win of his career. The 36-year-old Swiss racer crossed the line in a time of one minute 10.38 seconds, edging out America's Bode Miller by just 0.05 seconds. Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal and Max Franz of Austria finishing joint third after finishing 0.15 off Defago's pace. ""When you push so hard in your run, you cross the finish line and you have this something inside that needs to go out,"" Defago said, FIS-SKI.com reported. ""It's a great feeling... it must be all the energy I collected over the months that need to go out. ""I was not sure my run would be fast enough to win until the very end of the race but when I came down and I saw that I beat Bode and Aksel I knew I had a good run."" Defago's last win came in a downhill race in Bormio, Italy in 2011, but he will head to Sochi for the Winter Olympics, which get underway on February 7, with renewed hope that he can successfully defend the downhill title he won in Vancouver. It was also a good day for Switzerland in Cortina, Italy as Lara Gut won the final women's Super-G race before Sochi. Gut's time of one minute 27.81 seconds was 0.12 seconds better than Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein while Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch was third, 0.61 seconds behind the Swiss.","Reigning Olympic downhill champion wins fourth World Cup race of career .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi worshiped World Cup hero Diego Maradona, Roger Federer revered Grand Slam winner Pete Sampras while Sebastian Vettel idolized Formula 1 champion Michael Schumacher. But all Kamui Kobayashi had to look up to when he was growing up was his dad -- a sushi restaurant owner. Nonetheless, determination and desire drove the 26-year-old to the top of Formula One and on Sunday, he became the first local driver to stand on the podium at a Japanese Grand Prix since Aguri Suzuki in 1990 -- and only the third man from his country to finish in the top three at an F1 race at all. ""When I was growing up, I had nobody who I really wanted to be,"" Kobayashi, who now lies 11th in the drivers' championship standings, told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""I had no idea who the racers were, since my father just has a sushi restaurant and I never really watched a race. I maybe saw some Nascar races or whatever but I didn't care who the driver was -- I just wanted to drive the car. That was my only dream when I started."" Latest Formula One standings . Kobayashi's appreciation of F1 was hindered by both the inconvenient broadcast times of many of the races (particularly those in Europe) and by being the only member of his family with any interest in motorsport. At one point, he even turned his thoughts to entertaining a very different kind of audience. ""I wanted to become a comedian -- Amagasaki is quite popular for Japanese comedians. But I found I wasn't talented enough,"" Kobayashi told the sport's official website last month. Instead, comedy's questionable loss is undoubtedly F1's gain with the ever-smiling Sauber driver -- affectionately nicknamed ""Cowboyashi"" and ""Ko-Wasabi"" by sections of the media, and ""absolutely crazy"" by a smiling Jenson Button -- proving a popular figure on the circuit. And his exploits at Suzuka, where Vettel took the checkered flag to move just four points behind championship leader Fernando Alonso after the Spaniard retired early on, may just have inspired a new generation of Japanese drivers. The fans who thronged the famous track on Sunday had a nervy wait to see the first podium by a Japanese driver since Takuma Sato in 2004 as Kobayashi had to fend off a determined attempt by Button to pass him in the final laps. Chants of ""Kamui"" broke out from the grandstands as he was introduced at the post-race awards ceremony, before F1's only Japanese driver was eventually chased to his garage by delirious fans who had managed to infiltrate the paddock. ""This I cannot put into words. It was a fantastic feeling to see all the people in my home country so emotional and happy,"" was how the Amagasaki-born Kobayashi described his first podium to Sauber's official website. ""It gave me such a lot and I will never forget that moment. I want to thank the Japanese fans for the great support they gave to the Sauber F1 Team and to myself."" Prior to the race, Kobayashi had told CNN he believed the presence of so many impassioned supporters would not put him under pressure but simply give him more power. So it proved, as he completed his greatest F1 triumph just a couple of hours' drive from his home town -- sparking a huge party at Suzuka on Sunday night, with another celebratory event at the same venue attracting 5,000 fans on Monday morning. The timing of Kobayashi's success was perfect, not only because the driver's future with Sauber is uncertain but also because of Japan's reduced investment in F1 in recent years. Since 2008, economic reasons have prompted both Honda and Toyota to withdraw from the constructors' championship and Bridgestone to opt against renewing its contract to supply tires to F1 teams. ""I hope that with this kind of result there is fresh impetus for companies to come in. It's very important for the race in Japan, for F1 in the country, because now they have a driver who has given such a great performance,"" says Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn. Yet Kobayashi's place on the podium did not come easily, with a man who was appointed an international ambassador for sports and tourism by the Japanese government in September having long battled the odds to calmber to the top of F1. Even though his parents -- who choose not to own a car -- had limited interest in motorsport, his father, whose sushi delivery business is based in Amagasaki, backed Kamui in the well-worn path of go-karting when he was just nine. ""Sushi restaurants are a completely different world to racing but I just really wanted to do racing and it felt like destiny when I started,"" explained Kobayashi. ""My father was always supporting me but it was very difficult at the beginning because racing is quite expensive and it cost more than we expected. It was a really hard time but when I got a chance with Toyota, it was a great start and I gradually improved step-by-step until I progressed to F1."" After signing for Toyota's Driver Academy in 2004, Kobayashi graduated to being a Toyota F1 test driver before finally contesting his first F1 drive in 2009. ""In my time, there was a lot of support from manufacturers towards young drivers but now it's really difficult to find that,"" he says with a deep sense of gratitude. ""We had belief though, good results and kept working really hard to achieve the dream of becoming an F1 driver. In any job, talent is very important but the most important thing is to never give up."" This quality served Kobayashi well when Toyota retired from F1 three years ago, a decision which even found him thinking about working for his father's sushi business despite his stated dislike of raw fish. But the Japanese's skills, hard work and aggressive driving style were rewarded when Sauber picked him up shortly after. ""I think we're improving every year and this year, our car is really strong even though our budget stopped. After BMW left Sauber (in 2009), we spent a really difficult time but we're working hard every year and the car is getting more amazing,"" he says. This was proven when Kobayashi's speed meant that only double world champion Vettel and Ferrari's Felipe Massa finished ahead of him on Sunday, a day when he believes he came of age. ""I've always felt that if you ever want to look back and regard yourself as an F1 driver, you have to have been on the podium at least once,"" he told Sauber's website. ""Without such a photo, it's a bit as if you had never been there. So it means a lot to me. ""I instantly relaxed when (I crossed the line and) all the pressure came off. Without doubt it was a very important race for me in my career. And I felt: yes, now we will be having more strong races and really go for 5th place in the constructors' championship."" Sixth-placed Sauber's 116 points are 20 fewer than Mercedes and while he battles for his team, Kobayashi needs a strong finish in the season's five remaining races to not just continue his hard-fought F1 career but also to provide a hero for Japan's next generation.","Kamui Kobayashi thanks Suzuka fans for support after Sunday's podium finish .

"(CNN) -- Tyler Sampson, a middle-schooler from Frisco, Texas, doesn't let his differences get in the way of his dream. The seventh grader was born with only half of his right arm, but he still excels on the football field. This week, he was part of a different kind of victory. His story was included in the NFL's ""Together We Make Football"" contest, which highlighted inspiring, heartwarming and empowering stories from football fans around the country. Sampson and his parents had no idea that when a camera crew came to film a pep rally at his school, it meant he had won. Standing in the middle of his school's gymnasium, Sampson was surprised by his favorite player, DeMarcus Ware. Ware had another surprise, too -- tickets to this year's Super Bowl. Ware has been an inspiration to Sampson since they met in a grocery store a few years ago. Ware had taken a moment to encourage Sampson to follow his dreams of playing football. Four other special football fans also won the grand prize, including Lee Krost, who is the quarterback of a flag football team at age 75.

"(CNN) -- Mohamed Morsy considers himself still to be Egypt's leader, despite his ouster more than four months ago in a military coup, he said in a statement read by an attorney Wednesday. ""I am still the legitimate president of the Egyptian republic,"" Morsy said, according to the statement read by a lawyer who was part of a team of Muslim Brotherhood attorneys who visited with him in prison. Morsy, 62, called his ouster ""a high treason."" Opinion: Egypt and the death of liberalism . In the statement, which was read by Mohamed Al-Domati, Morsy said that he was kidnapped on July 2 by the Republican Guard and taken three days later to a naval base, where he and his aides have been held for the past four months. After a court hearing on November 4, he was then taken to the heavily guarded Borg Al-Arab Prison in Alexandria. The nation's first democratically elected president added that he had yet to meet with any representatives of the armed forces or of the Egyptian media. Morsy said no one has visited him except for EU Foreign Affairs Representative Catherine Ashton, a delegation of the World Elders Organization and four investigators, ""whose questions I refused to answer because their interrogation is a violation of the constitution."" Opinion: How to rescue the Arab Spring . In an apparent reference to mobile phone video of him speaking to unidentified persons that was leaked to the Egyptian media, he said, ""Everything that was attributed to me is baseless."" Morsy faces charges of incitement to murder, which are connected to protests against his rule last December and could result in the death penalty. Egypt's state-run news agency Ahram Online said Tuesday that the five-member delegation included his son, Osama, and that they urged Morsy to name a defense lawyer. But in the first trial session last week, Morsy refused to recognize the court. Under Egyptian law, criminal courts appoint a lawyer if a defendant refuses to engage one. Defendants are not allowed to represent themselves. The hearing, which was the first public sighting of the ousted president since his overthrow, was adjourned to January 8. Lawyers plan to challenge the court's jurisdiction on the grounds that the country's president shall not be tried without the consent of parliament, El-Damaty said, according to Ahram Online.

"(CNN) -- The year 1989 launched the Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament and the baseball film 'Field of Dreams' but the latter's famous line about how building a sports field in an unlikely setting would draw in major players can certainly apply to both. In fact, there are few better examples than what is today the Emirates Golf Club. Twenty-five years ago, the course was surrounded by acres of barren desert -- with barely a skyscraper to be seen in what was little more than a sleepy United Arab Emirates trading post. Nonetheless, the rulers of Dubai had the finances and inclination to back their extraordinary vision for what is reality today. They also had the verbal skills to persuade European PGA Tour organizers to stage an event far from their traditional home -- and in Asia for the first time. The results have been spectacular. On Tuesday, the roll call of champions that turned out to celebrate the Dubai Desert Classic's 25th birthday included some of the greatest names in the sport: Tiger Woods, Jose Maria Olazabal, Ernie Els, Fred Couples and Colin Montgomerie among others. Mark James, the first man to win a tournament originally called the Karl Litten Desert Classic, was also in attendance. The only one of the 21 former winners to miss the anniversary was Seve Ballesteros, who died three years ago, but the legendary Spaniard was represented by son Javier. The 23-year-old law student, who made his debut on the Challenge Tour last April, went round in a respectable two-over par. Yet most eyes were, as usual, on Woods, especially after the world No. 1's disastrous seven-over round at the weekend at Torrey Pines, a course where he has recorded eight victories. Woods finished in a tie for eighth position, paying the penalty for a double bogey after finding water on the 18th, but he seemed wholly untroubled by his poor start to the season as he played alongside Fred Couples and Stephen Gallacher, who won last year's Desert Classic. ""Playing with Fred is always a blast,"" Woods told the Dubai Desert Classic's official website. ""I have known him for so long and he is almost like a big brother to me."" The 14-time major winner first played in Dubai in 2001, when his reported appearance fee of $3 million generated plenty of global headlines. He has gone on to win the tournament twice, with his last victory coming in 2008 -- the same year as his last major triumph. Tuesday's event was won by Sweden's Henrik Stenson and Rafa Cabrera-Bello of Spain, who share the Champions Challenge trophy after both finished six-under par. ""It's a great place for me, it's always good fun to be back and celebrating the 25th anniversary this year is also very special,"" said world No. 3 Stenson, who lived in Dubai for nearly a decade. ""There's not many tournaments going on for that many years and we had a great roll of champions here so it's been a good event."" Yet the real contest will take place on Thursday, with a strong field featuring Woods, Stenson and Rory McIlroy among others. There will also be a special place for Barry Lane, the 53-year-old Englishman who is the only player to have contested every single edition of the tournament. Having finished sixth in the inaugural event, he has witnessed at first hand the remarkable transformation of Dubai from empty space to thriving international metropolis -- a genuine field of dreams.","Some of golf's biggest names celebrate the 25th birthday of the Dubai Desert Classic .

"(CNN) -- It was a fitting end to a remarkable era -- Alex Ferguson celebrated his final home game as manager of Manchester United with a dramatic late victory against Swansea on Sunday. While the result made no difference to either side's season, the jubilation that followed a rare winner from veteran defender Rio Ferdinand brought echoes from some of the 71-year-old's long list of triumphs in more than quarter of a century at the helm. ""My retirement doesn't mean the end of my life at the club. I will be able to enjoy watching them rather than suffering with them,"" Ferguson told the crowd in pouring rain at Old Trafford, which included his 11 grandchildren in the stands. ""But if you think about it, those last-minute goals, comebacks, even the defeats, are all part of this great football club of ours. It's been an unbelievable experience so thank you for that. ""I'd also like to remind you that when we had bad times here the club stood by me, the players stood by me, and your job now is to stand by our new manager. That is important."" Ferguson's replacement will be David Moyes, who is leaving United's English Premier League rivals Everton after more than a decade as manager. He will begin preparations for United's title defense when he formally takes over in July, with Ferguson's legacy being 13 league championships, two European Cups, five FA Cups, four League Cups, one European Cup Winners' Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. This season United regained the EPL crown from bitter rivals Manchester City, securing it with four games to play. ""It has been the most fantastic experience of my life. Thank you,"" said Ferguson, the most successful manager in English football. ""I have been very fortunate, I've been able to manage some of the greatest players in the country let alone Manchester United. ""All these players here today, they have represented our club the proper way and have won a championship in fantastic fashion. Well done to the players."" United took the lead six minutes before halftime through striker Javier Hernandez, but Swansea stunned the home fans when Michu volleyed in at the near post just four minutes after the interval for his 18th league goal this season. If the Spaniard's effort was a typically predatory strike, Ferdinand's stunning 87th-minute volley came out of the blue -- the former England center-back's first goal in more than five years. It also capped a home farewell for 38-year-old midfielder Paul Scholes, who announced on Saturday that he is retiring for the second time and will return to the club's coaching ranks. ""Paul is one of the greatest players this club has ever had and ever will have,"" said Ferguson, who brought Scholes into the first team from the youth ranks along with a ""golden generation"" that included David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville. ""I wish you a great retirement and I know you will still be around annoying me!"" added the Scot, who will remain at Old Trafford as a director on the board and as a club ambassador. One player who didn't feature in the match was England striker Wayne Rooney, who watched from the stands before joining the celebrations on the pitch. Ferguson later confirmed that Rooney has asked to leave the club, so he thought it was best to give the 27-year-old time to reflect on his decision. ""I think he wants to think it through in his mind -- I think that's a good idea. We're not going to let him go,"" Ferguson said. ""I think maybe he is a bit frustrated. He has been taken off once or twice in the past couple of weeks."" Ferguson also revealed that he had made his decision to retire last December because he wanted to spend more time with his wife Cathy, who had recently lost her sister. The win put United 13 points clear of City ahead of Ferguson's 1,500th and final United game away to West Brom next Sunday. City's season suffered another setback on Saturday with a 1-0 defeat to lowly Wigan in the FA Cup final, which has sparked speculation that manager Roberto Mancini will be sacked. While City sealed the second of England's Champions League places last weekend, the other two are still up for grabs. Tottenham moved above London rivals Arsenal into fourth place with a 2-1 win at Stoke on Sunday, as Emmanuel Adebayor scored the decisive goal with seven minutes to play. Stoke led early through Steven Nzonzi but Clint Dempsey -- who set up Adebayor's winner -- equalized before the home side had Charlie Adam sent off just after halftime. Arsenal can regain fourth place with victory over Wigan on Tuesday in a match that the third-bottom team needs to win to have any chance of avoiding relegation. Moyes will leave Everton in sixth place following a 2-0 win over West Ham, with both goals coming from Belgian striker Kevin Mirallas. Liverpool stayed seventh with a 3-1 win at Fulham as a hat-trick from striker Dean Sturridge meant the London side may need a point in the final round to avoid relegation. Newcastle and Norwich both won on Sunday to ensure another season in the top flight, respectively beating bottom club Queens Park Rangers 2-1 and eighth-placed West Brom 4-0. Sunderland could have condemned Wigan to the drop just a day after the club's biggest success at Wembley, but drew 1-1 with Southampton to stay in the relegation mix.","Alex Ferguson farewells Manchester United fans with 2-1 home victory on Sunday .

"Washington (CNN) --  ""So gimme a stage . Where this bull here can rage. And though I can fight, . I'd much rather recite . That's entertainment!"" -- Jake LaMotta, rehearsing his stage routine, from the movie ""Raging Bull"" It sounded like a good way to pass a snowy Washington day when the rest of the federal government was shut down because of the weather: watch a potentially entertaining Supreme Court oral argument, when the issue was about a Hollywood movie and the colorful life of a professional athlete. The appeal deals with a 1963 book and screenplay on the life of boxer Jake LaMotta, the former middleweight champion who wrote it with his childhood friend and business partner Frank ""Peter"" Petrella. LaMotta's story was made into the 1980 movie ""Raging Bull,"" starring actor Robert De Niro. But the underlying issue Tuesday was surely more dry: equitable defense and tolling for remedies in civil copyright claims. The dense subject matter was enough to temper the court's creative, even mischievous streak -- no pop culture references to showbiz or sports; no clever rhetoric about this being a ""knockout"" legal fight; and no justice who would admit ever seeing the Oscar-winning film. On purely aesthetic grounds, the justices' public review of the case was a disappointing script, the ending of which won't be known for months. At issue is whether Petrella's daughter waited too long to file a copyright infringement lawsuit over the original screenplay and the subsequent rights to the story. Her father died a year after the movie's release. Federal copyright law gave Paula Petrella the right to renew the copyrights before the term expired, which she did in 1991. But her lawsuit was not filed until 2009. MGM Studios and 20th Century Fox -- the movie's distributor -- say that violates the established legal principle of ""laches,"" which bars most claims that are unreasonably delayed, on the theory it would unfairly burden the adverse party. Both sides also dispute what ownership rights the studio retained after the elder Petrella's death, and which were subsequently returned to his daughter. Paula Petrella claims she is the sole owner of the book and the original screenplay, and that the subsequent film infringes on those copyrights. Paula Petrella seeks damages dating back three years from the filing of the lawsuit, and an injunction on further distribution of the work without compensation. Her lawyers claim the yearslong delay was caused by fear of retaliation, lack of money to file the suit and being told by the studio that ""Raging Bull"" was no longer making money. MGM and Fox say they have invested heavily to convert the film to formats such as DVD for home viewing, and for overseas distribution. The companies say having an open-ended period to file copyright claims makes it hard to make future business decisions. Justice Sonia Sotomayor posed tough questions for both sides. ""You see, counselor, this is my problem. I sort of disagree with you fundamentally, because I don't know that you're entitled to injunctive relief,"" she told Petrella's lawyer, Stephanos Bibas. ""The government says you might be entitled to payment for the use of your copyright because it belongs to you and there shouldn't be some adverse possession right that the other side gets. But in terms of injunctive relief, given their [studio's] reliance on your failure to act for 18 years, they shouldn't be put out of business and told that they can't continue in their business."" Later, the studio's attorney Mark Perry called the plaintiff's claims a ""bizarre argument."" He added Petrella sought to ""skim the cream"" and pick an opportune time to file her claim, after the studio invested so much in the movie over the years. ""What's so bad about that?"" asked Sotomayor. ""You've gotten a lot of profits in those 18 years and, in fact, at one point when she did reach out to you, you told her, 'Why sue? You're not going to get any money. We're not making any.'"" The movie won two Oscars, including best actor for De Niro, who portrayed the boxer. LaMotta is 92 and not a party in the appeal. The fighter also known as the ""Bronx Bull"" held the middleweight title from 1949-51. The case is Petrella v. MGM, Inc. (12-1315).","Daughter of screenwriter filed copyright infringement case .

"London (CNN) -- English soccer's most successful manager -- Manchester United's Alex Ferguson -- is retiring at the end of the season after more than a quarter of a century at the helm, the club announced Wednesday. The 71-year-old Scot has managed the English club, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and loved by millions of fans around the world, from Manchester to Manila and Montreal, since 1986. Everton manager David Moyes is the bookmakers' favorite to succeed his compatriot, and the 50-year-old will be confirmed as the next United boss on Thursday according to widespread British media reports. During his 26 years in charge, Ferguson -- a supporter of Britain's Labour Party who's renowned for dressing down players with the ""hairdryer treatment"" -- has won more than 30 trophies, including 13 league championships. Many fans took to Twitter to voice their appreciation, using the handle #thankyousiralex. He became Sir Alex when knighted by the queen more than a decade ago for his services to the game. 'Thank you for everything,' say Manchester United fans . As well as dominating on the pitch, Ferguson has helped build the century-old soccer club into a huge business operation whose progress is followed on stock exchanges around the world. Its shares dipped nearly 5% in early trading Wednesday. The Old Trafford club is owned by the American Glazer family, who oversaw the club's listing on the New York Stock Exchange last August. For the 2011-2012 season, United increased revenues by £14.2 million to £117.6 million ($182.4), the highest of any club in the Premier League. But it lost the top spot as the world's most valuable sports franchise in this year's Forbes list to Spanish soccer club Real Madrid. Forbes valued Manchester United at $3.17 billion, still ahead of Barcelona, another Spanish soccer club, and two U.S. outfits, the New York Yankees in Major League Baseball and the Dallas Cowboys in the NFL. Ferguson will bow out after the club's last game of the season, an away match against West Bromwich Albion, on May 19, according to a statement from Manchester United. Watch: Alex Ferguson's legacy . Before then he will have one more home game for the ""Red Devils"" at Old Trafford on Sunday, against Swansea City. 'A bright future' It's not clear who the club will choose to replace him. Ferguson will join the club's board as a director and ""ambassador,"" Manchester United said. ""The decision to retire is one that I have thought a great deal about and one that I have not taken lightly. It is the right time,"" Ferguson said. ""It was important to me to leave an organization in the strongest possible shape and I believe I have done so."" The quality of the team, the balance of the players' ages and its upcoming youth squad will contribute to its continued ""success at the highest level"" and ""ensure that the long-term future of the club remains a bright one,"" he said. Seven moments that defined Ferguson's managerial career . Ferguson paid tribute to the club's ""players and staff, past and present,"" thanking them ""for a staggering level of professional conduct and dedication that has helped to deliver so many memorable triumphs. Without their contribution the history of this great club would not be as rich."" He also expressed gratitude to his own family, the Glazer family, and the club's many supporters, at home and abroad. ""Alex has proven time and time again what a fantastic manager he is but he's also a wonderful person. His determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable,"" Joel Glazer said. The club also quotes former Manchester United and England captain Bryan Robson as saying Ferguson is the ""greatest there has ever been."" 'Extraordinary success' Gavin Hamilton, editor of World Soccer magazine, told CNN he considers Ferguson to be unsurpassed as a manager in his time. ""In the modern era, where's he's dealt with the players on huge salaries and the corporate world that is now football, he has had extraordinary success,"" he said. ""He's tough and uncompromising and, I think, completely dedicated to being a winner."" Whoever takes over at Old Trafford has a hard act to follow, Hamilton said -- but Manchester United will have been planning carefully for this moment. ""There will definitely be someone in place, I think -- the big question now is who that person will be because it's been kept a secret from everyone until now,"" Hamilton said. Whoever it will be has a daunting, if exciting, prospect ahead. ""It's the largest football club in the world, it's the biggest management job in the world, and on top of that is the task of following the most successful manager in the club's history,"" Hamilton said. While Moyes is favored for the job after more than a decade with EPL club Everton, other names on the bookmakers' list include: Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho, formerly of Chelsea and currently at Real Madrid; Borussia Dortmund's Jurgen Klopp; Michael Laudrup of Swansea City; and former Manchester United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, currently managing Norwegian team Molde. Health concerns? Fans' thoughts are bound to turn quickly to the 2013-2014 season, starting in September, as Manchester United prepares to defend its domestic title and attempts another win in Europe. As recently as last week, Ferguson suggested that he was fully involved in those future plans, promising the club would be ""competitive"" in the summer transfer market. Speaking to Inside United, the club's official magazine, Ferguson said: ""Hopefully the players we bring into the club in the next year or so will be of the quality we need."" Manchester United coasted to this year's English Premier League title with a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa in April, with four games in hand. Ferguson is due to undergo hip surgery this summer, according to UK media reports, but it's not clear how much of a role health concerns have played in his decision to stand down. ""I think retirement's for young people because you can do something else. When you get to my age, if your health is good, you like to work,"" he told CNN in a 2010 interview. Sports writer Mihir Bose said he was surprised by the timing of Ferguson's decision, despite his upcoming surgery, saying he had expected him to carry on as manager for another couple of years. Ferguson -- who is seen as a kind of father figure by some of the young players he developed -- has ""that ability to reach out to people,"" said Bose, but he is also a skilled political operator. ""He could be delightful but he was a man who made sure that he controlled the agenda,"" he told CNN. ""If you crossed his path he made it very clear that he controlled everything at Manchester United."" Those who got the famous ""hairdryer treatment"" -- loud shouting directly in someone's face -- included many sports journalists over the years. Ferguson would also refuse to speak to reporters if he didn't like what they said. Despite that thorny relationship, Ferguson will be remembered as an iconic figure in English football history, said Bose. The big challenge now is how Manchester United will manage the transition to ensure continued success, he added. 'A sad day' Former Manchester United and Denmark goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel told CNN he was still trying to make sense of the news. ""It is a sad day. I'm shocked, I'm sad, I'm disappointed. It's a day I think everyone who loves Manchester United, everyone who's worked with Sir Alex -- it's a day that we've been expecting, but I have to be honest I didn't think it would be now -- I thought it would be a couple of years down the line."" Schmeichel said he was certain that Ferguson had not been forced out but had made the decision himself, given his record of success and changes already happening on the club's board this summer. He paid tribute to Ferguson's knowledge, skills and philosophy as a manager, particularly his ability to bring on young players. Internationally known footballers like David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville and Nicky Butt were all created by Ferguson, Schmeichel said. ""He is the best manager in the world and he's the best guy as well. He's a really good friend as well."" Ferguson's talent has been in managing players individually rather than as a group, Schmeichel said. ""The end result is that everyone plays really well for the team,"" Schmeichel said. ""Yes, he can be hard, he can be tough. ... In a way he becomes your second dad. He has to educate you in life, he has to prepare you for what comes next in life after football."" 'Vision, energy, ability' David Gill, who will step down as chief executive of Manchester United in June, said it had been a ""tremendous pleasure"" to work alongside Ferguson over the past 16 years. ""We knew that his retirement would come one day and we both have been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the squad and club structures are in first class condition,"" he said. ""Alex's vision, energy and ability have built teams -- both on and off the pitch -- that his successor can count on as among the best and most loyal in world sport."" Ferguson began his career on the soccer pitch, playing for Scottish clubs Queen's Park, St. Johnstone, Dunfermline, Glasgow Rangers, Falkirk and Ayr United. But it was when he returned to the game as a manager, working at East Stirlingshire, St. Mirren and then Aberdeen that people really began to take notice. He led Aberdeen to three Scottish titles, four Scottish cups, one League Cup and one European Cup Winners' Cup before moving to Manchester United in November 1986 following the dismissal of former manager Ron Atkinson. It didn't take long for the Scotsman to start turning things round at a club that was then near the bottom of the league. Since then, Ferguson has dominated the English game -- his string of victories making him, according to the Manchester United website, ""the most successful manager in British football history.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court appeared cautiously willing to uphold its decades-old precedent giving labor unions the power to collect dues for collective bargaining from public sector workers, even those who choose not to join the union. That could avoid a major political upheaval in the national labor movement. But a number of justices indicated Tuesday during oral arguments they may rule more narrowly on the case at hand -- and exempt some home-care health providers from being designated ""state employees"" and forced under Illinois law to pay those fees. It is an economic and legal issue sharply dividing the business community and its allies on one side -- with the unions, some states, and the Obama administration on the other. At issue is whether the free speech and association rights of non-union personal assistants are being violated when Illinois negotiates exclusively with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) over wages, hours and working conditions. The court, as usual, went ahead with its public session despite the rest of the federal government shut down because of the winter weather. Three separate oral arguments took place into the afternoon. The justices almost never cancel them, operating largely on their own schedule, apart from the rest of official Washington. All members of the court were present, and even retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor watched attentively from the sidelines as a spectator in the crowded courtroom. It's called the 'agency shop' Lawyers from both sides faced sometimes withering questioning from the bench. ""I'm just going to use the word here, it is a radical argument,"" Justice Elena Kagan told the attorney for the non-union employees. ""It would radically restructure the way workplaces across this country are run."" But Justice Anthony Kennedy said the free speech aspect was important, such as the debate over negotiating the size of the government workforce. ""I'm talking about whether or not a union can take money from an employee who objects to the union's position on fundamental political grounds. I'm asking the justification for that under the First Amendment,"" he said. ""In an era where government is getting bigger and bigger, this is becoming more and more of an important issue to more people."" The Supreme Court has issued a series of incremental rulings over the decades. No worker can be forced to join a union, but the justices have recognized labor organizations carry a legal obligation to represent all employees. Under the ""agency shop"" dynamic, that means the non-union workforce must still pay their ""fair share"" for the costs of negotiating and administering binding contracts with the company. The theory is that all benefit from the fruits of collective bargaining, and that allowing individual workers to opt of the contribution -- for financial, personal, or ideological reasons -- would offer no incentive for anyone to pay the fair share fees, called ""free riding."" And the high court has said that arrangement can be important to maintain a stable workforce and ""industrial peace."" In 1977, the justices extended its precedents to include public-worker unions. But such fees cannot be used by unions to support purely political activities, such as backing electoral candidates. Forced to subsidize union lobbying? Under the cooperative federal-state Medicaid program for poor and disabled Americans, Illinois decided a decade ago to expand its authority over the estimated 28,000 home-care aides in the state. Illinois lawmakers justified the change by arguing even though the workers are typically employed by the individual patient, they are reimbursed under state-controlled Medicaid funds. Those home-care assistants are considered state workers only for the purposes of collected bargaining, with SEIU the exclusive representative for the separate Rehabilitation and Disabilities programs administered by Illinois. During arguments, William Messenger said his handful of clients -- many of whom provide home health services for their own family members -- were being ""forced"" to subsidize the union's efforts before the state, which he said was lobbying and ""political in nature."" ""But how does it differ from the typical bargaining that a union does? It asks for a wage rate and it asks for various benefits,"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, skeptically. ""So are you saying that when it's in the public sector, it gets converted into something else?"" ""What stops the people who oppose the union policy from sending a letter, asking a meeting, expressing their disapproval in any forum they want and in any way they want to whatever policy a union is advocating? Is there anything that stops them from doing that?"" asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor. When told there was nothing stopping them, she continued, ""So where's the First Amendment abridgement?"" Justice Antonin Scalia later added, ""So you're essentially destroying not just the [agency] shop, but you're destroying the ability of the union to get money even from the people who don't agree with what it's doing."" Justice Stephen Breyer put the question in more practical terms. ""You're asking us to overturn a case that's been the law for 35 years... I guess there are millions of instances in which employees and employers and others have relied on it in collective bargaining,"" he said, wondering ""why we should upset reasonable expectations over so long a period of time."" But some on the court were concerned these home-care workers were being treated differently than others in the public sector. When pressed by Chief Justice John Roberts, the attorney for the union, Paul Smith, said home-care workers could be forced to pay for the union's efforts to raise its Medicaid rates, but not public school teachers, whose union may be doing the same thing. Smith said since home-aid workers are paid directly through Medicaid, such negotiation and advocacy was ""perfectly appropriate."" ""So the same speech with respect to one union is a speech on a matter of public concern, but with respect to another union, it's not?"" Roberts asked, with his hand on his face. State says union representation helps all . The state argues state-compelled union representation has increased wages and benefits, reduced turnover and improved training and supervision for home-care workers who typically do not operate in a centralized workplace. And officials say allowing patients to be cared at home by those aides instead of permanent institutionalization has saved the state more than $630 million in Medicaid costs. But those aides bringing suit say the government has not justified its control, since no one in the state directly supervises them. And they say unions negotiating with the state naturally involve matters of public concern, which deserve greater protection from compelled free speech and association. Among the plaintiffs is Susan Watts, who cares for her daughter, Libby, in their home because of the girl's quadriplegic cerebral palsy, a stroke and numerous surgeries. She says being designated a ""state employee"" is not proper, since Illinois merely subsidizes a participants costs of hiring a provider for her daughter, which happens to be herself. She attended the arguments and told CNN afterward she was hopeful of prevailing. Near the end of the public session, Justice Samuel Alito raised the elephant-in-the-room issue, the suggestion the state's interest in having the union represent the home-care workers was about political payback. ""Do you think that the specific factual background of what occurred here provides a basis for skepticism about Illinois's reason for adopting this?"" The federal government's lawyer, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, replied the state -- as the ""manager"" of the Medicaid reimbursement program -- should not have its motives questioned. ""I thought the situation was that Gov. [Rod] Blagojevich got a huge campaign contribution from the union and virtually as soon as he got into office [in 2003] he took out his pen and signed an executive order that had the effect of putting, what was it, $3.6 million into the union coffers."" The current conservative majority on the court has been accused of being overly sympathetic of big business over worker and union rights. Two years ago, in a related case, the court hinted it may be willing to rethink its views on union fees in the larger context of free speech. The question could turn on whether the specific facts in this dispute would be enough to cast aside precedent, and allow a sweeping ruling against the union. The case is Harris v. Quinn (11-681). A decision is due by late June.","Non-union employees challenge Illinois negotiations .

"(CNN) -- From a 2-0 defeat at Oxford United on November 6, 1986 to a English Premier League coronation party through the streets of Manchester on May 13. Alex Ferguson's 26-year reign at Manchester United has seen the club transformed from a sleeping giant to a relentless, trophy-winning juggernaut in both the football arena and the sports business world. Following Wednesday's announcement that the Scot, the most successful coach in English football history, will end his Old Trafford tenure, CNN marks seven moments which have defined Ferguson's career. Sacked by St Mirren . Ferguson's managerial career has been littered with glorious highs, but it has not been without its lows, none more so than in 1978 when Ferguson was in charge of Scottish team St Mirren. He oversaw a remarkable upturn in St MIrren's fortunes which saw the unheralded club win the second-tier of Scottish football in 1977 with a squad which bore classic hallmarks of a Ferguson team, notably his faith in young players. That St Mirren side had an average age of just 19. But he was unceremoniously sacked by then St Mirren chairman Willie Todd for what he described as ""breaches of contract"" relating to the manager's decision to join Aberdeen. ''I regret the fact Alex did not stay longer at St Mirren and I regret the circumstances of his departure, but I still believe that the club had no alternative,"" Todd told Scottish newspaper the Herald in May 1999. ""There were no grudges. I've met him several times at football matches since then and our relationship is quite amicable."" Aberdeen roll over Real Madrid . Ferguson was finally appointed as Aberdeen manager in June 1978 and unprecedented success followed for the Scottish club. He broke the duopoly of Glasgow Rangers and Celtic, guiding Aberdeen to three Scottish League titles in 1980, 1984 and 1985. However, arguably Ferguson's finest moment with Aberdeen was on the European stage. Following a Scottish Cup triumph in 1982, Aberdeen qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup. Ferguson's team reached the final, with a 3-2 quarterfinal second-leg victory over Bayern Munich one of the many highlights of an impressive campaign. In the final, held in Gothenberg on May 11, 1983, Aberdeen faced Spanish giants Real Madrid, managed by the great Alfredo Di Stefano. The match finished in a 1-1 draw after 90 minutes, before striker John Hewitt scored the winner for Aberdeen in extra-time. Jock Stein's death . One of the most poignant moments of Ferguson's career arrived just over a year before he was appointed to the United job. Ferguson was part of Jock Stein's coaching staff with the Scottish national team ahead of a crucial 1986 World Cup qualifying match against Wales in Cardiff. Scotland needed a point to reach the tournament in Mexico, which they duly acquired following a 1-1 draw. But the match was overshadowed when Stein, the first British coach to win the European Cup with Celtic in 1967, collapsed after the final whistle. ""I grabbed for him as he started to fall,"" Ferguson recalled, when talking to the Daily Mail in 2012. ""The medics came out of the tunnel. I held him until he was helped inside. ""When I left to speak to the press I saw Graeme Souness and he was crying. 'I think he's gone,' Graeme said. I couldn't believe it. ""When we filed on to the bus there were thousands standing outside and the quiet sadness of the atmosphere was unforgettable. The abiding memory is of a solemn silence. It was as if the king had died. ""In football terms, the king had died."" Ferguson coached Scotland at the 1986 World Cup, but the team headed home after the first round following a group phase campaign which yielded just one point. After watching the pressures of football get the better of his mentor, it raises the question of whether Stein's death played a role in Ferguson's decision to bow out on his own terms. FA Cup redemption . After a trophy-laden spell at Pittodrie with Aberdeen, Ferguson headed south to join United in 1986, but his early days at Old Trafford were a world away from the glorious success he enjoyed in the 1990s and 2000s. Two seasons passed without a trophy and after eight league games without a win, it was suggested Ferguson would be sacked if United lost an FA Cup replay against Nottingham Forest on January 7 1990 . Substitute Mark Robins scored the winner to send United into the next round and, allegedly, save Fergie's job. Ferguson went on to mastermind a 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace in an FA Cup final replay after the first match finished 3-3 to secure the Scot's first trophy at Old Trafford. The silverware continued to flow, with an English Premier League title -- the club's first in 26 years -- arriving in 1993. Deja vu? Ferguson's retirement was originally scheduled for 11 years ago. The Scot announced in 2001 that the forthcoming season would be his last, hoping his decision to break the news in advance would allow the club to make suitable succession plans. But it had the opposite effect and, by November 2001, defending champions United sat ninth in the Premier League table. By January 2002, after an eight-match winning run, United had risen to the top of the table and the next month Ferguson reversed his decision to retire from the game by signing a new three-year contract at Old Trafford. The rest, as they say, is history. Six further English titles have followed, along with an FA Cup triumph and the Champions League in 2008. The Flying Boot . In addition to the trophies and the accolades, there have been plenty of spats, with numerous star players feeling the heat of Ferguson's infamous ""hairdryer"" treatment. Notably when a ""one in a million"" flying boot caught David Beckham above the left eye, an incident which dominated the headlines like no other flare up between Ferguson and one of his charges. Following a 2-0 FA Cup defeat to Arsenal in February 2003, Ferguson launched a tirade at his star midfielder which, according to Beckham's autobiography, went along the lines of ""David, what about the second goal? What were you doing? . . . We told you about it before the game. The problem with you is you don't let anyone talk to you. You don't listen'. ""I felt like I was being bullied in public,"" explained Beckham, who now plays for Paris Saint-Germain. ""I was being backed into a corner for no other reason than spite. I was trapped."" Beckham swore at Ferguson and bedlam ensued. ""The boss took a step or two towards me,"" Beckham continued. ""There was a boot on the floor. He swung his leg and kicked it. At me? At the wall? It could have been anywhere, he was that angry now. ""I went for the gaffer. I don't know if I've ever lost control like that before. Suddenly it was like some mad scene out of a gangster movie."" Beckham's teammates held him back, but after the incident, the then England captain appeared with a medical dressing over the cut above his eye. ""It was a freakish incident,"" Ferguson reportedly said. ""If I tried it 100 or a million times it couldn't happen again. If I could I would have carried on playing!"" An increasingly tempestuous relationship between the two personalities came to an end on 1 July 2003, when Beckham left Manchester United to join Real Madrid. Treble . May 26, 1999, was a night which simultaneously defied belief and defined Ferguson's Manchester United reign. United were chasing history. The league title had been wrapped up, beating Arsene Wenger's Arsenal to the Premier League title by just one point. FA Cup success followed. Goals from striker Teddy Sheringham and midfielder Paul Scholes secured a straight-forward 2-0 win over Newcastle United in the final at Wembley. Ferguson's team were one step away from securing an unprecedented Premier League, FA Cup and European Champions League treble. United's opponents in the European Cup final at Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium were Bayern Munich and the Germans looked set to win the showpiece match after Mario Basler's first-half free-kick put them 1-0 ahead. In search of a way back into the match, Ferguson threw on substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. As the game ticked into extra-time, United earned a corner. Goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel raced forward in a desperate attempt to force an equalizer. The initial cross was cleared, but the ball fell to Ryan Giggs whose low shot from the edge of the box was turned into the net by Sheringham. Cue jubilant celebrations among United players, fans and coaching staff, but uncontained joy was to follow seconds later. United earned another corner kick in the final seconds of injury time. Sheringham flicked on Beckham's cross at the near post and Solskjaer flung his right leg at the header to send the ball flying into the back of the net. Bayern were beaten, United had completed an historic treble. As Ferguson remarked to ITV after the incredible climax, ""football, bloody hell.""","Alex Ferguson will retire as Manchester United manager at the end of the season .

"(CNN) -- A pen and a phone may not seem too dangerous, but in the hands of President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats, they have proven to be devastating. Just four years ago, when Democrats controlled Congress, Obama called then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and turned over our country's health care policy to the Democrats.

Jim Matheson and Mike McIntyre -- two of the most vulnerable Democrats in the country -- recently announced their retirements, taking two seats completely off the board for House Democrats. Remember, Matheson held the most Republican district of any House Democrat in the country and McIntyre's district wasn't far behind. Obama, the pain and fear must be named . These aren't the only tragic blows for House Democrats. Bill Owens from New York recently announced his retirement too, leaving open a district in which Republicans are in a solid position to win. And one of their prized recruits, Pete Festersen in Nebraska, dropped out of his race just weeks after announcing. Seems the toll of Obamacare and Obama's anemic approval ratings are proving insurmountable for both incumbents and candidates. This year's State of the Union is a defining test for Obama . In contrast, Republicans have had a string of recruitment successes. Our pickup opportunities are all over the country, from California to New Hampshire. We have top-tier candidates like Air Force veteran Martha McSally in Arizona, son of Cuban exiles Carlos Curbelo in Florida, and former Democrat Evan Jenkins in West Virginia -- who was so tired of Obama's ""war on coal"" that he switched parties to challenge vulnerable Democrat Nick Rahall -- just to name a few. Obamacare is not going away as a political issue. The failures we've seen so far are just the beginning, and the consequences aren't just political. Bottom line, the American people don't need a pen and a phone. What they really need is a job and a paycheck. 7 things you didn't know you didn't know about the State of the Union .

"(CNN) -- Pitchers Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine headline 19 newcomers to the National Baseball Hall of Fame ballot, the Baseball Writers' Association of America announced Tuesday. Maddux and Glavine -- both 300-game winners who won multiple Cy Young Awards -- are on the ballot for the first time. Other notable first-timers include Frank Thomas, Jeff Kent and Mike Mussina. Another newcomer is Eric Gagne, who was named in baseball's Mitchell Report on performance-enhancing drug use. Gagne admitted in 2010 to using human growth hormone. He joins other players from the heart of the steroid era who are back on the ballot: Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. But many of this year's newcomers are perceived to have had clean careers, making this ballot one of the best in history. Maddux won four consecutive National League Cy Young Awards from 1992 to 1995. He also won a record 18 Gold Glove Awards in his 23-year career. Maddux won 355 games with a 3.16 earned-run average, led the NL in ERA four times and won at least 15 games for 17 consecutive seasons. He played for the Chicago Cubs, Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres. Glavine won the NL Cy Young in 1991 and 1998 and was a 10-time All-Star. He won 305 games in 22 seasons with the Braves and the New York Mets. He won 20 games in a season five times and won four Silver Slugger Awards. Thomas won back-to-back American League MVP Awards with the Chicago White Sox in 1993 and 1994. He finished his 19-year career with 2,468 hits, 521 home runs and 1,704 RBIs. Kent was named the NL MVP in 2000 and hit 377 home runs in his 17 seasons spanning the San Francisco Giants, Mets, Dodgers, Toronto Blue Jays, Cleveland Indians and Houston Astros. Mussina won 270 games and had a career .638 winning percentage in 18 seasons with the Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees. A total of 36 players will be on this year's ballot. The complete ballot is: Moises Alou, Jeff Bagwell, Armando Benitez, Craig Biggio, Bonds, Sean Casey, Clemens, Ray Durham, Gagne, Glavine, Luis Gonzalez, Jacque Jones, Todd Jones, Kent, Paul Lo Duca, Maddux, Edgar Martinez, Don Mattingly, Fred McGriff, McGwire, Jack Morris, Mussina, Hideo Nomo, Rafael Palmeiro, Mike Piazza, Tim Raines, Kenny Rogers, Curt Schilling, Richie Sexson, Lee Smith, J.T. Snow, Sosa, Thomas, Mike Timlin, Alan Trammell and Larry Walker. Last year, for the first time since 1996, no one was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Candidates need at least 75 percent of the vote to be elected, and a player has never been unanimously voted into the Hall of Fame. Results will be announced January 8. Inductions will be July 24 in Cooperstown, New York.","Cy Young Award winners each won more than 300 games in their careers .

"(CNN) -- The Golden Globes are the height of Hollywood glitz and glamour -- not exactly where you'd expect to find gritty reality at every turn. And yet, many of Sunday night's biggest winners were honored for roles and films based on real life. Recent films such as ""Argo"" and ""Lincoln"" racked up awards last year, but the 2014 Golden Globes were especially good to those who honored the past by recreating it. Both of this year's best pictures, ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""American Hustle,"" were, as they say, ""based on actual events,"" with Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence picking up individual honors for ""Hustle."" Leonardo DiCaprio earned a Golden Globe for playing real-life convicted fraudster Jordan Belfort in ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" and Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto received trophies for another true tale, ""Dallas Buyers Club."" Complete coverage of the 2014 Golden Globes . The trend even extended to television, where the Golden Globes honored the Liberace biopic ""Behind The Candelabra"" and its star, Michael Douglas. And to music, as U2 effusively praised the late Nelson Mandela when the group accepted its award for a song from ""Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom."" In all, 10 Golden Globes went to films and actors that brought drama rooted in reality to the screen. As if to underscore the power that real-life stories can bring to film and television, two of the night's biggest ovations went not to actors or directors, but to people portrayed on film this year: Philomena Lee, the woman searching for her long-lost son, played by Dame Judi Dench in ""Philomena,"" and Niki Lauda, the legendary Formula One racer played by Daniel Bruhl in ""Rush."" As he spoke, Lauda removed his cap to show his head, scarred by the fiery, near-fatal crash at the movie's center. The audience at the Beverly Hilton Hotel cheered him, and ""Rush"" star Chris Hemsworth beamed -- the man who plays ""Thor"" obviously thrilled to share the stage with a real-life action hero.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- With foreclosures and bankruptcy affecting millions of homeowners, CNN's Larry King on Tuesday talked to several experts in the real estate industry to get advice on handling the mortgage meltdown. Barbara Corcoran says homeowners have ways of getting mortgage companies to pay attention to them. His panel on ""Larry King Live"" was made up of real estate expert Barbara Corcoran, correspondent Michael Corbett, developer Jorge Perez, real estate magnate Donald Trump and financial expert Robert Kiyosaki. Larry King: Is this a good time to sell a house? Barbara Corcoran: Of course it's not a good time to sell a house. The question is, if you must sell a house, how do you unload it, considering the enormous competition that's out there?  Watch the panelists respond to questions » . King: Suppose you have to sell. Corcoran: There's one way you can always sell a house in any old market. You can intentionally under-price it. If you go out to your own marketplace and intentionally under-price your home 20 percent to 25 percent less than you think it's worth, or that a credible appraiser tells you it's worth, you will sell that house within the week. There's no such a thing as an unsellable house. It's always a question of numbers. King: What's the biggest mistake people facing foreclosure make? Michael Corbett: The biggest mistake right now is when you get that default notice, you ignore it. People think that if they just ignore it, it will buy them more time. It's absolutely the opposite. The first thing they should do when they get those notices is contact either the lender or go to HUD [the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]. Get a certified counselor. There's free counseling out there for people, because if you just go ahead and ignore these notices, they automatically trigger legal action. And that moves it faster. If you want to buy some time, call the lender, call a counselor. King: Let's take a call from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Caller: I have a loan with Countrywide, and they will not refinance our interest-only loan, because they say our debt-to-income ratio is too high, and their workout department won't even look at us because we've never been behind on our mortgage and we're not currently behind. It's going to reset in August. What can we do? Corbett: Unfortunately, a lot of the mortgage companies and the banks don't want to talk to you. It's very sad, until you're actually in arrears. Their loss mitigation or their workout department, they don't want to help you until you're two months or three months in debt. King: Barbara has a solution. Corcoran: I have a solution, and it's a fall-back solution, but it sure gets attention. You can make an appointment, or not make an appointment, go over there with the deed to your property and the keys to your front door and say, OK, I've had it. Here's my deed, here's my keys, and you'll get attention. One other thing, you should always put your requests by certified mail. By law, the banks don't have to answer phone calls. But by law, they have to answer certified mail, and a lot of people don't use it. King: We have an e-mail question from S.O.S. in California: ""I got a condo in April of 2005 for $500,000. Now it's only worth about $400,000. Could I refinance it to get a better interest rate, or should I try to negotiate with the mortgage company to adjust the payment?"" Jorge Perez: I would definitely negotiate with the mortgage company. Lenders are having tremendous problems right now. They have a huge amount of REOs, real estate-owned properties, and they do not want your house or condominium. We are advising all the people that we know that have those problems to go talk to their lenders, and they will talk to their lenders. I think one of the biggest problems, nevertheless, is that a lot of people borrowed on variable rate interests when they had mortgages at 1 and 2 percent that grew up over time. And their jobs have not gotten better, and now they're paying much higher interest rates than when they got their mortgages. And this is a big, big problem in real estate today . King: We have an e-mail question from Debbie in Orlando, Florida: ""What's a family to do if they lose their home to foreclosure? How can they find a suitable place to live? Aren't they going to be rejected as renters on grounds of poor credit?"" Donald Trump: This is now the time to go out and try making a deal, try buying a house. The banks are there. It's already financed. You don't really need the money because it's already financed. They are already in. They are already wet. I don't recommend renting now. I recommend now is the time to buy. Buying is much better than renting. King: Even if you've been foreclosed? Trump: Absolutely. You can make deals. So many people are being foreclosed. Millions and millions of people. It's no longer got that horrible stigma. This is the time to go out and make a deal. The money has already been put in. It's not like they are putting in new money. The money has already been put in. They own a house. They want somebody to live in that house. King: What's your advice, Robert? Robert Kiyosaki: Back in the '80s, I got my butt kicked in the market. That's when interest rates were about 18 percent to 20 percent and I was trying to make deals at 18 percent to 20 percent. And it really taught me a good lesson that I had to get smarter. So when I got pounded in the late '70s and early '80s, I at that point said I better get smarter, and today, I have made millions of dollars because of a bad experience. But if you're not -- if you don't learn from the experience and you think the government is going to bail you out, then you've wasted a big opportunity to learn something.","Barbara Corcoran: Under-pricing is a way to sell a home .

"Baton Rouge, Louisiana (CNN)  -- My son, Gordon, died aboard the Transocean Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20, 2010. That statement, standing on its own, might say everything about my life these days. But in truth it says little. Although I am consumed with grief over the loss of Gordon, because I am a lawyer, I am needed elsewhere. Gordon's older brother Chris and I are directing all our energies to try to make right an outdated law that would deprive my daughter-in-law, Michelle, and her two boys, my grandsons, of ""more nearly fair compensation"" for the loss of their husband and father. I make careful use of the term ""more nearly fair compensation"" because no amount of money could ever compensate any of us for Gordon's loss. Our loss, and the loss of everyone who ever knew Gordon, is incalculable in mere dollars. But our system provides that money damages must be paid by wrongdoers when they cause the death of another. Judges and juries do their best to arrive at the ""most nearly fair"" amount to try to compensate loved ones for their losses. In a system that is imperfect, the Death on the High Seas Act stands alone in the draconian way it limits the recovery of damages for wrongful deaths on the high seas. It is a law passed in 1920, almost a century ago, and it was intended to provide for widows and others who lost breadwinners to wrongful acts at sea. But the law provides only for the recovery of ""pecuniary"" damages, known popularly as ""out-of-pocket expenses."" Michelle and her sons, one of whom was born a few weeks after Gordon was killed, are entitled to recover only the loss of the income Gordon would have earned, minus any income taxes, and minus whatever amounts it is determined he would consume himself. Once that figure is established, an economist would be employed to estimate the present day value of those future losses. As the law stands, that final number is all that BP has to pay Michelle and her sons. Common sense tells us, though, that the loss of Gordon's paycheck is relatively insignificant compared with the loss of Gordon himself. When Michelle tells her boys about their dad, she's not going to show them a pay stub. She'll tell them how much he loved them both, how funny he was, what a good golfer he was and how much others loved to be around him. One of the last things Gordon, a 1 handicap, got to do was to give Stafford, age 2, his first golf lesson. It was, of course, the last golf lesson he will get from his father. So how much is ""most nearly enough"" to compensate them for Gordon's loss? That will be for jurors to decide once they have heard evidence, not only about how the disaster happened, but about the loss that will always be felt by those who loved him. Senate Bill 3463, introduced by Sen. Patrick Leahy; and House Resolution 5503, by chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Rep. John Conyers, seek to address the inequities of DOHSA. Both proposals, which have multiple co-sponsors, allow for the recovery not only of pecuniary damages, but non-pecuniary damages as well. ""Non-pecuniary damages"" are defined as ""loss of care, company and companionship."" That definition is intended to describe the very great loss suffered by his survivors apart from his earnings alone. Few knowledgeable people dispute the growing evidence that BP was negligent in the way it bungled the completion of the well and caused this blowout, and that its negligence was ""willful and wanton,"" terms used in maritime law for centuries to provide for the award of punitive damages against this kind of egregious misconduct. Sadly, after the Exxon Valdez disastrous oil spill, the United States Supreme Court in Exxon v. Baker ruled that punitive damages may be awarded in maritime cases only on a 1:1 ratio with compensatory damages. Of course, that holding defeats the purpose of punitive damages. Punitive damages are assessed against wrongdoers for the same reasons we put criminals in jail: to punish the wrongdoer; to teach the wrongdoer not to act that way again, and to set an example for others. The punitive damages as reduced by the Supreme Court in Exxon v. Baker did none of those things. So Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse has introduced Senate Bill 3345, which simply provides that in computing punitive damages in maritime cases, the amount of compensatory damages is not to be considered. As I testified before the House Judiciary Committee, making BP pay punitive damages will hit BP where its heart would be, if it had a heart. Support for these bills is growing, but we expect opposition from all the companies who don't want to pay fair compensation when, by their fault, someone on board their vessel is killed. Cruise lines have consistently opposed changes to DOHSA. Many of their passengers are, because of their youth or advanced age, not providing financial support to anyone. If a cruise ship crew member negligently kills one of these passengers, the cruise line is liable for funeral expenses and nothing more. All companies involved in offshore drilling and shipping have been vigorously opposed to  changes in DOHSA. The argument these companies make to congressmen and senators is simple: We don't want to pay ""more nearly fair"" compensation when we kill people. It will cost us too much money. They probably go so far as to claim a change in DOHSA will inevitably result in the loss of valuable jobs in each congressman's district. The Transocean Deepwater Horizon disaster has shined a bright light on the deadly results of negligence on the high seas. It is time for Congress to recognize that a reprehensibly unfair situation has existed for decades. Now is the time for cruise lines, the petroleum industry and the shipping companies to finally stop using their economic might to prevent reform. They must support -- not oppose -- these bills. The American people will be watching. More and more learn each day about the unfairness of DOHSA. Legislators who listen to lobbyists instead of their constituents may regret that choice in November. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Keith D. Jones.","Keith Jones' son Gordon died on BP oil rig leaving behind wife, two sons .

"(CNN) -- The captain and second officer of a container ship that ran aground last year resulting in New Zealand's worst maritime environmental disaster, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a range of charges. At a court in Tauranga in northeastern New Zealand, the two men pleaded guilty to ten of eleven charges brought by Maritime New Zealand, which included operating a vessel in a dangerous manner, discharging harmful substances and perverting the course of justice by altering ship documents. The identities of the men, both Filipinos, have been suppressed. Currently remanded on bail, they will be sentenced on May 25, according to a statement from Maritime New Zealand. Willfully perverting justice carries the heaviest maximum penalty of the charges, with seven years of imprisonment. The cargo vessel, Rena, hit a reef off Tauranga in clear conditions on October 5. At least 350 tonnes of fuel oil spewed into the sea, killing thousands of sea birds and contaminating the beaches of Tauranga's Bay of Plenty. Efforts to clean tainted beaches and salvage the containers and debris from the stricken ship are still underway.","Captain and second officer plead guilty to charges including operating a vessel in dangerous manner .

"(CNN) -- The Texas Giant roller coaster reopened Saturday with improved safety measures and long lines of eager riders, nearly two months after a woman plunged to her death while on the ride. Riders lined up at the roller coaster just after Six Flags Over Texas opened at 10:30 a.m., and long lines were still there by evening, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The Texas Giant had been closed since July 19, when Rosa Esparza, 52, fell out of a car and plummeted to her death. Her family filed a civil wrongful-death lawsuit Tuesday, accusing Six Flags of negligence. At 14 stories, the wood-and-steel coaster boasts a steep drop of 79 degrees and a bank of 95 degrees, according to Six Flags. The improved safety measures include a test seat at the ride's entrance so riders can voluntarily check how well they fit into the seat. Cars have a newly designed ""T-bar"" restraint along with seatbelts, WFAA reported. A nearby diagram shows the right way for the bar and belt to fit: both snugly at the rider's waist. The wrong-way diagram shows the seat belt in the correct position but the metal bar well above the rider's waist. ""You can tell they're being extra-careful,"" one rider told WFAA of park officials Saturday. According to the lawsuit, Esparza's daughter, who was riding in front of her mother, heard screams and turned around to see her mother being thrown out of the car. Esparza was thrown against the ride and catapulted onto the metal roof of a tunnel below, the lawsuit says, dying from traumatic injuries. ""As Rosa Esparza's tragic death starkly illustrates, errors on the part of the Six Flags Defendants turned a thrilling illusion into a nightmarish reality,"" the lawsuit says. ""Customers of the park expect mock scares and delighted screams as they ride the Texas Giant roller-coaster, but they certainly do not expect to be placed in any real danger, whatsoever."" Six Flags spokeswoman Sandra Daniels responded in a statement Thursday, ""While our thoughts and prayers remain with Ms. Esparza's family and friends, there are a number of inaccuracies contained in the recent lawsuit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously."" Park officials said in a statement Tuesday that an investigation at the Arlington, Texas, park revealed that there had been no mechanical failure on the ride, but it declined to release more information because of pending litigation. Texas state officials have approved the reopening of the ride, the statement said, adding that it had undergone extensive testing. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","The roller coaster at Six Flags Over Texas has been closed since the July death .

"(CNN) -- Millions of Syrians, living in desperate conditions, are hoping that the peace talks in Switzerland will bring some immediate changes. But the difficulty in reaching agreement even on humanitarian access -- let alone the issue of a transitional government and the future role of Bashar Al Assad -- illustrates the difficulties in translating the elite-level Geneva meetings into real changes on the ground. The Syrian government has come to the table because it thinks it has gained the upper hand politically, especially since it has become clear that Western countries do not have the appetite to intervene militarily. Meanwhile, the regime's key allies, Iran and Russia, continue to back it strongly, partly because they see Assad as a force against jihadi terrorism. The recent U.S.-Iranian rapprochement has not encouraged Iran to change its position on Syria; the opposition and its Gulf allies are worried that it has done the opposite. They argue the U.S. has in effect signaled to Iran that it is only interested in the nuclear issue, and is thus willing to ease sanctions on Iran despite its continued involvement in the violence in Syria. The Syrian government now says the U.S. has resumed arming ""terrorist groups"" in Syria, which may be intended to puncture any such complacency. But arming the opposition is unlikely to tip the balance decisively when opposition forces are facing a large state army backed by other states and by regional militias. Important absentees . Moreover, this form of high-level, international summit at a luxury resort is seen as well suited to interactions between states. It is not geared to represent the complex and fragmented mixture of non-state actors involved in the Syrian conflict. The opposition consists of many different, localized factions and militias. The armed groups that are controlling many areas on the ground are absent from the internationally brokered peace talks, raising concerns about how any conclusion would be implemented by the Syrian National Coalition (SNC); compare the difficulties that the Libyan transitional leaders, accepted by the international community, have had in actually imposing their authority over militias on the ground. There is also the problem of bringing the key regional players -- Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the Gulf states -- into any agreement. The issue of Iranian participation was badly mishandled on the eve of the talks. But there are ways to bring them in through proxies or parallel diplomatic processes. Saudi Arabia has signaled it may be willing to work with elements of the regime in a transitional government, but sees Assad as a red line. Both the role of Assad, and the broader question of Syria's role as a conduit for arms to Hezbollah will be major sticking points. A slow process . Western diplomats are trying to manage expectations, saying the Geneva talks are the start of a long process that could take many months. It is predictable that they have so far stalled over the issue of a transitional government. In theory it should be possible to build more of a consensus on humanitarian issues, such as allowing aid into the besieged city of Homs. But even food is politicized, as control of food supplies is being used as a political tactic to put pressure on opposition-held areas, and as the regime has now created a situation where agreeing to allow citizens to eat can be portrayed as making a ""concession."" The credibility of all the supposed political representatives is suffering from the ongoing agony on the ground. The regime is not showing seriousness in building confidence -- despite the many options it has to release imprisoned activists and to end the siege on hungry areas. Meanwhile, the SNC needs to place the needs of the internally displaced and refugees as a central priority; this does not mean compromising on their political goals, but would rather give them more credibility on the ground. In interviews in Turkey and Lebanon, many refugees have criticized the SNC for not paying enough attention to their humanitarian needs. Even in a best case scenario, the solution will involve many steps. The first should be reaching a ceasefire and an agreement on humanitarian aid. The suggestion by the regime, recently supported by Iran, of having a ""democratic election"" -- which is technically due to take place this year -- is hardly a realistic option when millions of citizens have been forced out of the country. The opposition needs to be prepared for a lengthy process. The SNC in particular need to try to open new channels of communication with different opposition factions and gain more support from all Syrian communities, to address the fears among some Syrians that even if there was a change of regime, they could just end up moving from one dictatorship to another. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Kinninmont and Abdullah Ali.","Syrian government and opposition representatives are attending peace talks in Geneva .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Two years ago, the sight of pristine-looking peas that had arrived all the way from Kenya to London made an impression on a would-be entrepreneur, Jenny Dawson. The peas had been tossed aside at a wholesale food market, getting ready to be sent to the landfill. Soon after that, on a friend's farm, crates of apples, deemed too small for their buyer, were left out to rot. Seeing all this waste pushed Dawson, 27, who formerly worked for a hedge fund, to start a business using surplus produce. The model for Rubies in the Rubble, her jam and chutney business, was born, with the goal using food that would otherwise get tossed to create foods that people would buy. ""Preserves seemed almost a natural thing to be doing with a glut of fruit and veg, because it then lasts up to 10 months,"" Dawson said. Infographic: Food waste; From farm to fork and landfill . The massive global problem of food waste has received more attention in recent years, and the figures are staggering. A U.N. report estimated last year that around the world, one-third of all food produced for human consumption is wasted. Many food banks now collect leftover foods from hotels and restaurants and redistribute them to those in need. Composting has become a common method of recycling food as fertilizer or soil amendment. Interactive: Businesses making the most of our food waste . But businesses like Dawson's have also cropped up to make use of food items that would otherwise end up in landfills. Awareness campaigns have helped the cause, she said, and change can be felt in the initiatives taken by supermarkets and restaurants. Waitrose, the U.K.-based supermarket chain, in October achieved its goal of sending zero food waste to landfills. Instead, unwanted food is donated or sent to anaerobic digestion plants to convert the material into biogas. Other major U.K. retailers are following suit, with Marks & Spencer announcing similar plans. And Dawson says consumers' attitudes have changed too. ""Two years ago, people didn't like the word 'food waste,' because people wanted to be seen as having the best, having the perfect thing,"" she said. ""Then as organic and being homegrown started to creep in, people actually liked the strange-shaped carrots or the small, different apples because it felt more organic and homegrown."" In California, two entrepreneurs saw an opportunity in the mounds of coffee grounds thrown out each day by cafes in their own neighborhood. They now run a thriving business based on reusing waste. Interactive: Human misery behind high food prices . Nikhil Arora and Alejandro Velez were business students at the University of California, Berkeley, when they first heard in class that mushrooms could be grown entirely on discarded coffee grounds. The concept piqued their interest and led to the formation of Back to the Roots, a business that has gone from farming mushrooms to selling mushroom-growing kits, all relying on used coffee that gets thrown out by 35 cafes in and around Berkeley.

""Since day one, our first vision for this company, why we fell in love with it, was this idea of 'waste to food' and 'waste to wages,' â€” that you could create a really cool company in an urban setting, create really good jobs out of what was waste, and something about that was so powerful to us,"" Arora said. The company's main product, a mushroom-growing kit, is a cardboard box that houses a plastic bag filled with coffee grounds and mushroom spawn. Slit open the bag and mist the contents with water, and pearl oyster mushrooms will begin to grow, until they are spilling out the side of the box, reaching their full-grown size in about 10 days.

Arora said they use ""a massive stack"" of coffee grounds per day, and it comes to about 18,000 kilograms of reused grounds per week. However he realizes it is still but a tiny contribution to relieving the amount of food products that go to waste. ""We know our mushroom kit's not going to solve world hunger, it's not going to themselves reduce the entire issue."" Arora hopes that growing one's own food could bring to individuals, especially children, a greater awareness of where food comes from. And he says that the idea easily engages a wide spectrum of the public, from foodies to children to environmentally-conscious people. ""We like to say if you're sitting on a flight, no matter who you're sitting next to, you could talk to them about this mushroom kit,"" he said.","Annually around one third of all food produced is wasted, according to U.N.

"London (CNN) -- The world's most influential political and business leaders are gathering in an upmarket ski resort in the Swiss Alps this week to discuss the biggest challenges facing society in 2012. Six hundred miles away from the snows of Davos, in rainy London members of the Occupy movement are celebrating 100 days since they set up camp outside St Paul's Cathedral, hoping to find solutions to some of the same problems. The protesters have been there since October 15 last year, battling both the elements and the authorities. Their decision to establish a protest village in the heart of London's financial district, the City, was a controversial one. Demonstrators had first attempted to occupy the nearby London Stock Exchange, but were quickly moved on. Instead they pitched their tents around the steps of St Paul's, one of the most famous landmarks in the city: A symbol of London's endurance during the dark days of the Blitz, and a site of celebration, as the venue for the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. The camp sparked rows between the authorities and the church, which stepped in to protect the occupiers from the police, allowing them to stay, despite threats of eviction. Two leading members of St Paul's later resigned over the row. Jesse Jackson: Occupy in memory of MLK . Occupy London spokeswoman Naomi Colvin says the movement has achieved a tremendous amount in its first 100 days. ""It has been an astounding success,"" she told CNN. ""It is very noticeable how all the political parties represented in parliament have been bringing themselves around to Occupy -- we are setting agendas that others then follow."" Protester Bryn Phillips agrees: ""We've raised a lot of important issues, we've made it possible to discuss a lot of subjects which were not being mentioned, and we have been able to include the public and people who are usually excluded in that discourse. ""Five years ago, if you talked about the problems of capitalism, you were branded a maniac, now even [Conservative British Prime Minister] David Cameron is talking about the nature of capitalism; we've made it possible to discuss it without people accusing you of being a communist."" Last week, the City of London Corporation won a high court fight to force the closure of the camp. The occupiers insist they will appeal, but Phillips concedes it may be time to move on. ""Personally, I think it is time for the tents to go,"" he said. ""They have served their purpose, but I think there is a risk of us becoming too emotionally attached to them. ""By occupying part of the City of London, we have found out a lot, we have raised a lot of issues: The lack of transparency, the lack of accountability, but we don't need to be outside St Paul's to do that any more."" Colvin insists, though, that any shift away from the original site will not signify the end of Occupy London -- quite the contrary: Whether or not the St Paul's camp survives, she says, the movement itself will continue to make its presence felt in the coming weeks, months and years. ""I think we will see day-long 'Occupations' in city centers, in shopping areas and in other locations, and I think Occupy will spread out more into the community,"" she said. ""We have brought a lot of people together, people with specialist knowledge, who have been able to create networks of expertise, and those links, those conversations will continue, whether the physical site is there or not."" Occupiers are already doing outreach work, giving talks in citizenship classes at local schools, and encouraging people to become more involved in democracy. Phillips says this and other community work is key. ""Our society has gradually been confiscated, fragmented over the past few years, and the point of Occupy is to help repair the severed links, to restore a sense of reciprocity and social cooperation. ""We need to get out into the boroughs and the parishes, and to support the non-economic institutions which are trying to do the same thing, whether that means churches or Citizens' Advice Bureaus."" And some camping will continue at Finsbury Square, which began as an overflow from the main site at St Paul's, and where there is, Colvin hopes, ""no threat of eviction"" -- occupiers there are hoping to create a sustainable eco village. Paul, from Lincolnshire, is a relatively new arrival at Finsbury Square. He says Occupy was never intended as a quick-fix. ""It's a long-term protest movement,"" he told CNN, sitting in front of a wood-burner to keep warm in the drizzle. ""We've seen huge one-day demonstrations before -- the march against the war in Iraq had 1.5 million people in it, but it didn't stop anything. ""The government is supposed to be there for the people, but they don't do anything for us when we ask,"" he said, explaining that he hopes that will change, in the face of a concerted and long-lasting Occupy campaign. Fellow occupier Jack, back at St Paul's, agrees. ""We won't be rushed -- we are only three months into a discussion which is so big, and so important, how can you expect us to have reached a consensus already? Give us a chance, be patient."" But Jack insists that Occupy is far more relevant to ordinary people than the World Economic Forum, which he says welcomes only the global elite. ""I think Davos is the complete opposite of Occupy -- Davos is there to represent the powerful, while we're here to represent the people. We're trying to balance things out as best we can, to show that there are alternatives to the system as it stands, to have a debate about it, but not to impose our views on people. ""Davos is very exclusive, whereas we welcome anyone, we are completely inclusive -- to the point of madness sometimes, because you do get the occasional crackpot -- and everyone is listened to. ""It seems very unequal, very unfair, because I don't believe that [the delegates at Davos] all want to make the world a better place for everyone, and yet they are the ones holding all the tools, they are the ones with a lot of the power to do that."" But there are Occupiers in Davos too. They may not have made it onto the stage at the World Economic Forum, or be taking part in debates with the likes of Angela Merkel and Al Gore, but they are here all the same, in a temporary settlement of igloos and yurts near the conference center. Blog: Meeting the Occupy Davos protesters . ""We are not just here to build igloos,"" David Roth told CNN. ""We are here to have protests on the streets. ""We should take the power back; we should not let the richest 1% have the power -- they cannot be the solution for our crisis, because they are the crisis, they are responsible for the crisis."" And there are signs that despite the icy temperatures, relations between the two camps, Occupy and the World Economic Forum, may be thawing. ""There have been attempts to broker a conversation,"" says Colvin. ""It may not happen this year, but we hope it can happen in future."" Robert Greenhill, WEF managing director, recently dropped in to the Davos camp to help build one of the igloos, and later hinted on Twitter that the groups have more in common than some might think. ""Different approach, same goal: Improving the state of the world."" CNN's Erin McLaughlin and Irene Chapple in Davos contributed to this story.","Occupy protesters in Davos have built igloos to camp close to the World Economic Forum .

"(CNN) -- As the saying goes, don't bring a knife to a gun fight. Or, in this case, don't try to hold up a gun store with a baseball bat and a knife. Authorities in Oregon say a man who tried to rob a gun store outside of Portland was just so under-armed when he tried to pull off a heist Thursday afternoon. The suspect ended up on the ground, taking orders from the store manager who held the man at gunpoint until police came. The would-be robber apparently was looking to step up his weaponry -- he smashed a glass display case at Discount Gun Sales and pulled a handgun from the display, the Washington County sheriff's department said in a news release. The store manager then drew his own handgun and ordered the suspect to drop his bat, his 9-inch knife and the purloined handgun. Washington County deputies responded to the call and found the suspect on the floor when they arrived. Derrick Mosley, 22, was being held at the Washington County, Oregon, jail, with bond set at $250,000, the sheriff's department said. He was charged with first degree robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm, according to the news release.","A would-be robber smashes a a glass display case at a gun store in Oregon .

"(CNN) -- Chinese authorities were explicit: Tear down the nation's first sex-themed amusement park before it gets going full steam. Visitors catch a glimpse of Love Land, billed as China's first-ever sex theme park, in southwest China. Love Land had not opened its doors yet, but authorities in the city of Chongqing -- a sprawling metropolis on the banks of the Yangtze River -- got all hot and bothered over the park's plans to display naked human sculptures, giant replica genitals and a photo gallery on the history of sex, the state-run China Daily reported. Lu Xiaoqing, park manager, told the newspaper he got the idea for building Love Land after a visit to a sex park in Jeju, a popular destination in South Korea. Love Land would include sex-technique workshops and sex education to help adults ""enjoy a harmonious sex life,"" Lu said. ""Sex is a taboo subject in China, but people really need to have more access to information about it,"" he told the newspaper. ""We are building the park for the good of the public."" Whatever Lu's intentions, the newspaper said Chinese officials saw it another way: ""vulgar, ill-minded and misleading."" The park was to open in October but was demolished over the weekend -- thongs, replicas of derrieres and all. Reactions posted on the Internet were varied, according to the China Daily. Some thought sex was best left behind closed doors, while others argued that a real need for sex education existed in China. ""Sex is a matter of privacy. It is not for publicity,"" said Xia Xueluan, a sociology professor at Beijing University. The officials in Chongquing apparently agreed.","Love Land was to display giant replica genitals and photo gallery on history of sex .

"(Rolling Stone) -- The ""heady fwendship"" between Erykah Badu and Wayne Coyne, formed on the grounds of her guest feature on ""The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends"" Record Store Day LP, has hit a rough patch. Badu posted a lengthy tweet chastising the Flaming Lips frontman for the NSFW video released for their collaboration, ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"" which went viral on June 1. In the video, Badu soaks naked in a bathtub singing the airy lyrics, interrupted by shots of her little sister Nayrok getting deluged by liquid corn starch, gold glitter and a milky substance. (Badu is no stranger to taking her clothes off for cameras. Her video for ""Window Seat"" shows the Queen of Neo-Soul stripping to her knickers while strolling through her native Dallas.) While Badu first called ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" video ""cosmic"" in a tweet, she criticizes Coyne for releasing an unapproved version of the visuals, and she went as far as calling him ""self serving"" in the TwitLonger message. ""I never would have approved that tasteless, meaningless, shock motivated video,"" Badu wrote. In the message, she claimed Coyne misled her in their collaborative process. ""Yu did everything wrong from the on set,"" she wrote. ""First: You showed me a concept of beautiful tasteful imagery (by way of vid text messages). I trusted that. I was mistaken. Then u release an unedited, unapproved version within the next few days. That all spells 1 thing, Self Serving. When asked what the concept meant after u explained it, u replied ,""it doesn't mean anything, I just want to make a great video that everyone is going to watch."" I understood, because as an artist we all desire that. But we don't all do it at another artist's expense. I attempted to resolve this respectfully by having conversations with u after the release but that too proved to be a poor excuse for art."" Back in March, Badu talked to Rolling Stone about the collaboration, saying Coyne interrupted her 29 times during the recording process until she was forced to say, ""C'mon man, just let me sing it!"" Badu bought this up again in her retort, posting, ""I should have followed my first mind back in studio when recording the vocals 'your way.'"" Badu fans were outraged by the NSFW video, forcing Coyne to take full responsibility for the footage on Twitter. The Lips camp has since also released the following statement: . ""The video link that was erroneously posted on Pitchfork by the Flaming Lips of the Music Video 'The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face', which features Erykah Badu, is unedited and unapproved. Sorry!! We, the Flaming Lips, accept full responsibility for prematurely having Pitchfork post it. It has outraged and upset a segment of fans and we apologize if we offended any viewers!!! This is a Flaming Lips video which features Erykah Badu and her sister Nayrok and is not meant to be considered an Erykah Badu or Nayrok statement, creation, or approved version."" Despite the Lips trying to make amends, Badu still had these last words: ""you can KiSS MY Glittery A**."" See the full story at RollingStone.com.

"(CNN) -- You're bound to find all the usual suspects on television pretty easily on Christmas Day -- ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Home Alone,"" ""Miracle on 34th Street."" But what if you're feeling like the Grinch, or you want something a little different this holiday season? Something where strange little creatures spread anarchy through a small town? Or kids home from college run wild on drug binges? Or Santa turns out to be evil? Then we've got the film for you, with plenty of nostalgia as your wrapping paper: . 'Bell Book and Candle' (1958) Think the only Jimmy Stewart Christmas movie is ""It's a Wonderful Life""? Check out this enchanting story about a man who falls under the spell of a witch on Christmas Eve (one of the inspirations for the TV show ""Bewitched""). Stewart reteams with his ""Vertigo"" co-star Kim Novak, the witch in question, who uses her cat/familiar Pyewacket to get her upstairs neighbor to jilt his fiancee and fall for her instead, even if falling in love might make her lose her powers. Among her other charms -- she prefers to walk barefoot, even in the snow. 'Trading Places' (1983) In this twist on Mark Twain's ""The Prince and the Pauper,"" wealthy Dan Aykroyd switches life circumstances with a homeless Eddie Murphy at Christmastime. During his lowest point, Akyroyd dresses as a grubby Santa Claus in order to crash a Christmas Eve party at his former employers' house, so that he can try to plant drugs in Murphy's desk and perhaps get his job (and life) back. This, needless to say, does not work -- and probably placed him smack dab on Santa's naughty list. 'Fanny and Alexander' (1982) One of the most ornately decorated homes for the holidays you'll ever see is in Ingmar Bergman's ""Fanny and Alexander,"" in which the Ekdahl Christmas party takes up the first third of the film (especially if you watch the televised versus theatrical version, which gives a generous amount of time to the decadent feast, including recipes). It's the most lavish and luxurious party you'll get an invite to this season. 'Gremlins' (1984) Yes, there's a cute mogwai as a Christmas present, and tons of mischievous gremlins who really know how to decorate a Christmas tree, but ""Gremlins"" does more than create total anarchy out of the holiday season; it also exposes its heartbreak. Phoebe Cates delivers a chilling monologue about how her father broke his neck trying to climb down the chimney, and she learned there was no Santa Claus. Not for kids of any age who still believe. 'Lethal Weapon' (1987) ""Jingle Bell Rock."" Drug busts in Christmas tree lots. And if you've ever agonized about what to give someone for the holidays, consider the present Mel Gibson gives Danny Glover -- the unfired hollow-point bullet he would have used to commit suicide. See, it really is the thought that counts. Honorable mention: ""Die Hard."" 'Less Than Zero' (1987) ""Are you coming home for Christmas?"" Jami Gertz asks her very recent ex, Andrew McCarthy. He thinks he has a shot at getting her back, even after discovering she's been sleeping with his best friend, Julian (Robert Downey, Jr.). But as he learns at a very fabulous and very pink ""F*** Christmas"" party, decorated with fake penguins on fake ice glaciers, the only snow they're going to get this Christmas is cocaine. Julian is in the throes of a serious drug habit, and despite his friends' best efforts, it only gets worse. The whole piece is impossibly glamorous, decadent, and sad. 'Brazil' (1985) Christmas is not what you might expect in Terry Gilliam's classic. A mother reads to her children about Tiny Tim, and as they ask about how Santa will come visit if they don't have a chimney, a team of police intruders drops through the roof and takes their father away on sabotage charges. ""Father Christmas"" turns out to be the minister of information, and a bomb goes off in a department store during peak shopping hours -- one of the many swipes the film takes at Christmas commercialism. Geeks' most beloved holiday classics . The Tim Burton trio: 'Edward Scissorhands' (1990); 'Batman Returns' (1992); 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (1993) It always snows at Christmas because of the ice sculptures that Edward Scissorhands creates for the girl he loves. Mistletoe provides an occasion for Batman and Catwoman to kiss (OK, lick). Even Gotham's own Santa Claus (Christopher Walken) and the Penguin (Danny DeVito) can't ruin Christmas, despite their manipulation of the good-will-toward-men spirit. So of course Jack Skellington (as directed by Henry Selick) wants some Christmas, too -- all of Tim Burton's creations do. 'Love Actually' (2003) Several stories intersect around the holidays (including those of Hugh Grant; Martin Freeman, before he was a hobbit, as a porn star stand-in; and Keira Knightley as the unavailable object of affection for ""The Walking Dead's"" Andrew Lincoln), revolving around the ensemble cast's different relationships. Check out the terrible cover of ""Love is All Around"" -- ""except,"" as aging rock star Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) explains, ""we've changed the word 'love' to 'Christmas.'"" 'Children of Men' (2006) Most Christmas movies aren't about the Christmas story at all. Sure, they've got the trappings of the holiday -- even the ones mentioned on this list have presents, stress, mistletoe, snow, Santa Claus and/or parties. But in contrast, ""Children of Men,"" set in a dystopian future where humanity has given up hope after 18 years of mass infertility (no more babies, no more future of civilization), is about a woman who miraculously becomes pregnant. She reveals her state to Clive Owen in a manger of sorts, to which he declares, ""Jesus Christ!"" And when she gives birth, the baby's cries cause a ceasefire -- at least long enough to get them out of the building. Peace on earth still has to wait another day. A Stocking Stuffer -- 'Rare Exports' (2010) Santa exists, but this Finnish film reveals that the man credited with giving gifts to children all around the world is more about the naughty than the nice. After being trapped in a grave for centuries, he's free, and he's on a killing/kidnapping spree. Be careful you don't make his list.","""Trading Places"" is a twist on Mark Twain's ""The Prince and the Pauper""

"(CNN) -- For more than three years, Hallie Twomey has struggled with the suicide of her 20-year-old son, C.J. She searched his belongings for a note with a clue of what tormented him. She sought counseling and attended support groups. Nothing helped, she said. Now, a plea initially to Facebook friends throughout the United States to help C.J. ""see the mountains that he never got to climb, see the vast oceans that he would have loved, see tropical beaches and lands far and away"" by scattering his ashes has turned into an international effort. Strangers from India to Jamaica are spreading his ashes in tribute to the adventurous young man. A separate Facebook page called ""Scattering CJ"" has more than 4,000 likes. ""How do you say thank you for that?"" Twomey asked in an interview with CNN. ""It's been so much and so amazing but I'd give it all back if I could have C.J. It doesn't go past me that it's Christmas, and holidays are so hard for us. I just wish I had him and none of this."" Still, the outpouring of support since her ""Scattering CJ"" page went up November 11 has been a source of comfort. On Facebook, the pictures and videos chronicle the places: From the Grand Canyon to the Caribbean, from Australia to Morocco, C.J.'s ashes have been spread. ""Quite frankly, I spent the first two weeks doing nothing but crying,"" Twomey, of Auburn, Maine, said. ""I just wasn't prepared for what people were sharing and how somebody who has absolutely no connection to me could be affected."" Along with the ashes, Twomey sends a note and a small photo of C.J. in a Boston Red Sox T-shirt. His ashes have even been scattered at Fenway Park, home of his favorite team. His mother asks the recipient to think about her son and the people he helped through organ donation. She also asks that in their thoughts, they remind him that ""Mom and Dad love him, and that Mom is sorry."" Many of those scattering the ashes have also been affected by suicide or have outlived their children, she said. ""I'm so touched,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Johannes Mehserle, a former San Francisco Bay Area transit police officer, is appealing his involuntary manslaughter conviction for the killing of 22-year-old Oscar Grant in Oakland. The move has deeply angered Grant's family, who say the appeal is an attempt for Mehserle to clear his name so that he can become a police officer again. ""I'm here to denounce his attempt to clear his record. He committed such gross negligence that he should not be allowed back on the streets to protect and serve again,"" said Grant's mother Wanda Johnson at a news conference Friday in Oakland. The appeal to overturn the conviction was filed this week and argued during a court hearing on Wednesday, according to Michael Rains, Mehserle's defense attorney. The appeal questioned some of the evidence and instructions that were given to the jury at Mehserle's 2010 trial. The three-judge panel of the First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco could make a decision on the appeal in 90 days. Mehserle was accused of fatally shooting Grant on New Year's Day 2009 on a platform of a Bay Area Rapid Transit station. Mehserle said at the trial that he intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun. He was sentenced to two years in prison for the involuntary manslaughter conviction, but was released last year because of a California law that allowed him to reduce his sentence to nearly a year. Grant's family members said they were also angry that they were not informed about the court hearing. ""We're angered. We are hurt,"" said Cephus Johnson, Grant's uncle. ""We were denied our right to be at this hearing. We applied to be informed about any hearing that pertained to Johannes Mehserle. This proceeding is an example of shutting victims out of the process. The family is outraged."" This case has been controversial in California's Bay Area community for years. The 2009 shooting was captured on a bystander's cellphone video camera. The video showed Mehserle pulling his gun and fatally shooting Grant in the back as another officer knelt on the unarmed man. The video was widely circulated on the Internet and on news broadcasts, and it spurred several protests in and around Oakland. CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","Johannes Mehserle was convicted in 2010 of killing an unarmed man .

"(CNN) -- Paris police on Tuesday continued to search for the man who shot a photographer twice near the heart with a shotgun in the lobby of the French daily newspaper Liberation on Monday. The victim was in intensive care, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said. The gunman fled after the attack, and authorities released photos showing a 5-foot-6-inch to 5-foot-8-inch tall man with a ""European appearance"" and graying hair. He was estimated to be between 35 and 45 years old. Police said he was carrying one or two bags and was wearing a khaki parka or a green pullover, a dark sleeveless vest, green-and-white basketball shoes and a dark cap. On Tuesday, police released another image of the suspect that showed him wearing what appeared to be a red parka, blue T-shirt and pale brown knitted hat. Paris police had no information about the man's motive, and prosecutors issued a plea for witnesses who may have seen a man ""making death threats while carrying a gun,"" according to a statement. The suspect apparently also opened fire in front of Societe Generale towers in Paris, the international bank said on Twitter. There were no injuries in that shooting, and police are investigating, the bank said. Another man told police he was carjacked in the neighborhood of La Defense. The bank's towers are in the same neighborhood. The man said he dropped the assailant off near the Champs-Elysee, the city's main street, according to police. On Friday, a gunman broke into BFMTV, threatening journalists before fleeing. The description of the man at Liberation is similar to that of the man at BFMTV, and the gun used was of similar caliber, police said. But it has not been established that it was the same man. 'A fundamental freedom ... critically injured' ""We will do everything in our power to catch this individual,"" Interior Minister Manuel Valls announced Monday. ""In our country, we cannot accept those who attack our fundamental rights, a right that women and men have always fought for all over the world. Lives have been lost over this right."" There had been no recent threats against the paper, and security was not high, managing editor Fabrice Rousselot told CNN affiliate BFMTV. ""Liberation is not and never has been a bunker. Liberation is a place of freedom,"" publisher Nicolas Demorand said. ""We do not want to work behind bulletproof glass. We do not want to work behind iron curtains. ... ""We don't know the motivation, whether this was an act by a madman, but we can see today that a fundamental freedom has been critically injured."" Demorand told BFMTV that the 23-year-old assistant photographer was ""a little better"" Tuesday, but still in critical condition.

"(CNN) -- You may tell your airline if you prefer an aisle seat to a window seat or if you'd rather have chicken than pasta. Some things, however, like the fact that you pick all the cashews from the mixed nuts, or that you always drink a gin and tonic in the airline lounge, you might not. Lately, though, airlines have a way of knowing your preferences, even when you don't tell them. The culprit? Social media, of course. Recently Qantas started a tryout to monitor digital conversations on social-media sites like Twitter or on Facebook. The technology comes from Australian start-up Local Measure, and it allows corporate clients to search not by keyword but by GPS coordinates. As a result, when a customer posts a picture on Instagram (even one without a caption) from one of ten Qantas airport lounges, the customer care team is alerted immediately. ""It allows us to pinpoint customer feedback to a specific location. If someone raises an issue, it gives our lounge staff the ability to step in and resolve the problem,"" says Jo Boundy, head of digital communication at Qantas. If a customer groans on Twitter about a long line at the coffee counter or a broken printer in the business lounge, Qantas can respond in real time. According to Jonathan Barouch, chief executive at Local Measure, other airlines will be soon introducing the technology to their lounges as well, allowing the companies not only to respond to problems, but to anticipate them as well. ""It helps our clients better understand what people are thinking about their experience,"" he says. Read more: How high-end airline meals are made . For example, Barouch says, a customer recently tweeted a picture of cereals on offer at the Qantas first-class lounge and noted that his favorite was absent. The next time he visited the lounge, the cereal was there. ""Qantas knew how to surprise and delight the consumer. It's all little things, but they do add up,"" he says. Because of the speed with which a staff member can respond on Twitter or Facebook, social media has quickly become a favored platform for airlines' customer service. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines employs 130 people to monitor different social-media platforms, including VKontakte, a social networking website popular among Russian-speaking users, and Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Social media has become such a popular medium for KLM customers that the company introduced an estimated service response time to their Twitter account, even though the ability to do so isn't built into Twitter (KLM works around this by updating the background image every five minutes). For the most part, response times hover around one hour. Read more: Airline upgrades are now up for action . ""We decided to put our money where our mouth is and show our real-time performance,"" says Martijn van der Zee, senior vice president of e-commerce for Air France-KLM. Reflecting how attuned the company is to their online followers and customers, their suggestions help KLM create new products and services, including one introduced last week that allows non-passengers to purchase upgrades and gifts for friends and family traveling with the airline. Other ideas developed from social media are destination guides based on cabin-crew favorite spots, and a service that allows staff members sweep planes for forgotten wallets, tablets and mobile phones, and contact the customers (sometimes before they realize their item is missing). ""If these were suggested to me four years ago, I might have said, 'These aren't relevant,' but now we know that they are, because we get messages coming in every day telling us they are,"" says van der Zee. ""We have 30,000 interactions a week. That's a lot of input, and it's motivated us to keep pushing the envelope.""","Social media has become a favored platform airlines' customer service .

"New York (CNN) -- The final bid for a trading card that the National Baseball Hall of Fame calls ""the Holy Grail"" topped $2.1 million -- the highest price ever paid for a baseball card in a public auction. The 1909 card of Pittsburgh Pirate shortstop Honus Wagner -- one of only about 50 in existence -- was auctioned off by Goldin Auctions in West Berlin, New Jersey. Bidding started at $500,000 on February 25. The buyer chose to remain anonymous after the successful bid, but Ken Goldin, owner of Goldin Auctions, told CNN he is ""best described as a wealthy individual investor and a baseball fan."" Goldin said the buyer did not indicate what they planned to do with the card. A total of 15 bids were made for the prized item. The card is in short supply because Wagner made the American Tobacco Company recall it when he discovered it had made the card without his permission. He didn't want kids to buy cigarettes, the auction house said. The card was released as Wagner was on his way to winning his seventh batting title and about to lead the Pirates to their first World Series win. It's garnered such a place in baseball history that it has its own plaque at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The winning bid came in at $2,105,770.50, including the buyer's premium, according to a statement from Goldin Auctions on Saturday.

"(CNN) -- Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is facing yet another corruption charge. A preliminary indictment by a judge in Naples alleges that the 77-year-old bribed a senator to change sides and supported his party in 2006, Berlusconi's lawyer said Wednesday. Sen. Sergio De Gregorio's change of allegiance eventually helped bring down the center-left government of Romano Prodi in 2008, paving the way for Beruslconi to become prime minster for a third time. The senator is cooperating with prosecutors and a first court hearing is scheduled in Naples for February 11. Berlusconi says he is innocent, according to his lawyer, Michele Cerabona. The former Prime Minister has been the subject of multiple corruption and bribery charges over the years. In August, Italy's high court upheld a four-year prison sentence for tax fraud, and this month, a lower court ruled that Berlusconi should be banned from public office for two years. Because of his age, it's unlikely Berlusconi will spend any time in prison. Silvio Berlusconi, so long! Berlusconi gets 7 years in underage sex case .

"(CNN) -- Actor Matthew Lewis, who spent the last 10 years portraying Neville Longbottom, the awkward, nerdy pal to the trio of students at the center of the Harry Potter films, is moving on. As the last of eight films based on the books by J.K. Rowling hits movie screens across America, Lewis spoke with CNN about his journey as Neville and how it has not just affected him, but prepared him for a career as an actor. CNN: Neville Longbottom starts out as a pretty psychologically wounded character, and you have been able to portray his journey of personal growth. Most people pay a lot of money to psychologists to make a journey like that. What life lessons have you learned from Neville? Lewis: Oh wow. the great thing about Neville -- what message he conveys that J.K. Rowling wrote for him -- was that you can have any kind of disadvantage at the start of your life and it doesn't define you. You can still go on to be whoever you want to be. As long as you have friends around you and you have a belief in doing the right thing, you can go on to be a hero. It doesn't matter what humble beginnings you came from. I think that's really inspiring. I think that's a really nice life lesson. CNN: What do you think fans like best about Neville? What do they identify with? Lewis: It's really the underdog success story of it all. Everybody loves an underdog, but crucially, it's the message that a lot of people can have a pretty lousy time at school. A lot of people struggle in their younger years and I think people can relate to that. And Neville shows that's not the be all end all. You can still go on to do great things in your life. What I've gathered from fan mail and meeting people is that that's quite inspiring, and it helps some people get over bullying at school or whatever difficult problems they're having in life. As an actor, that's the loveliest thing in the world to think that something you're doing, what your job is, is inspiring people. CNN: Is there a difference between U.K. and U.S. fans' reaction to Neville? Lewis: You know, it's a very similar reaction only it's different in terms of -- how do you explain it? -- I guess Americans tend to be quite a lot louder. But the responses are the same with varying degrees of excitement. CNN: A lot of people are probably surprised by the man you grew into. Your nerdy look in the films, even your slightly crooked teeth, were very endearing to fans, and you look quite different now. What has coming out the other end of Harry Potter been like for you personally and professionally? Lewis: Well, it's a really exciting time to be honest with you. When the films finished I obviously had a degree of sadness about it all coming to an end. Having done something that you've loved so much for such a long time, it's obviously going to be sad when it comes to an end. But it's also an exciting time because for the first time in a decade, I don't know what's coming next. And really, it's the opportunity now for me to show that I'm not just Neville Longbottom, there is more that I can do, and I really just want to sort of push myself. It's a transitional period at the moment, and we'll have to see what happens next. CNN: Do you like the fantasy genre as an actor, or is there a different genre that inspires you? Lewis: Genre is not something I particularly look at. I just want to be an actor -- in theater, on television, in film. I love the idea of being able to become somebody else, and it's like being a child and never having to grow up. I can dress up in fancy dress and play make believe as a job and people pay me to do that. It's fantastic. I never have to get old. But I would love to do something grittier. I'd love to do sort of a war picture or a gangster film or something much more real life. But I can't begrudge the fantasy genre. I'm a huge fan of ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Harry Potter"" and ""Star Wars,"" science fiction, that kind of stuff. CNN: What's your favorite memory from your total Harry Potter experience? Lewis: I've got two. One's Harry Potter related and one's definitely not, but it came about because of Harry Potter. The first one, the Harry Potter one, was my first week at work. It was in Annik Cathlin in Northumberland, England, and it was the broomstick lesson when Neville Longbottom gets on the broomstick and is flying around and crashing into walls. I just remember being so frightened of the whole process of being in this big, big film. And then I was told by Christopher Columbus that the first scene I would be doing was all about me and I would be working with the stunt team. It was very nerve-wracking, but he put me at ease and made me relax, and it ended up being the most fantastic week. I remember being very excited for the next six months or so. Little did I know that it would go on for another decade. And the other thing that I will never, ever forget is being able to meet Sir Paul McCartney, which definitely came about because of Harry Potter, and I'll never forget that. He's a personal hero of mine. What a fantastic night. CNN: Has J.K. Rowling let you know what she thinks of how you brought her character to life? Lewis: Yes. And it's obviously something I was really concerned about. J.K. Rowling is just the most incredible author, and I've loved her stories since I was a boy of 9 years old. I was so focused on getting it exactly how she imagined it in her head. And a couple times I spoke to her at premiers and she came to the studio and said, you know, I'm doing it right. It's exactly how she wanted it. And as a compliment you can't get much better than that. To have J.K. Rowling say that, it was just the most amazing feeling. And she was so lovely. She mentioned it on the red carpet, as well, on [last]Thursday in London, and it's a nice thing to hear. It's great for the fans to love what we do, but for J.K. Rowling to enjoy it, too, it just means so much. CNN: What will you do now? After a thrilling end to such a consequential pop culture event, many people might say, ""I'm going to Disney World."" Where are you going? Lewis: I've been doing theater for the past six months in the U.K. Alan Rickman told me to do theater, he recommended theater, and so I did. And it was really a learning experience for me. I wanted to expand my ability, and I want to try and learn as much as possible and really add another string to my bow, if you like. I feel like I've grown in confidence as a person and an actor in theater. It really is a foundation for all acting, whether in television or film. It really is where it all started. So I would not mind going back in the theater at all, but I've got a couple of things that I'm reading through at the minute. I've got a meeting when I get back to London, as well, in a couple of weeks. I want to take what I've learned in the theater and what I've learned on Harry Potter in the last decade and really just take it to the next level. Forge out an acting career. And I'm not focused on trying to better Harry Potter, I'm not focused on trying to get a leading man role, I just want to act. I very much see myself as a jobbing actor who needs to work, and so I just keep looking to get back on the wagon and keep working.","Matthew Lewis takes inspiration from his character Neville Longbottom .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian police arrested former Prime Minister Hisham Qandil in an apartment in Giza governorate, according to state-run news agency EGYNews. Qandil had been sentenced by a court to one year in prison for contempt. It said he failed to carry out a ruling to nationalize a private company while he served under now-deposed President Mohamed Morsy. Qandil was a little-known water minister who became the nation's youngest prime minister when Morsy picked him for the position in July 2012. Morsy, backed by the Muslim Brotherhood and the nation's first democratically elected president, was forced out of office in July, 2013, with detractors saying he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values. Morsy is in custody, facing charges of incitement to murder in connection with protests against his rule last December. He has refused to recognize the court. The interim Egyptian government has cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood, and in September a court ruled the group's activities are illegal. The military and police have detained large numbers of Brotherhood officials and supporters since the Morsy's ouster. Several hundred people have died in clashes between pro-Morsy demonstrators and security forces since the military removed him.","State media: Qandil was arrested at an apartment and will serve one year in prison .

"(CNN) -- Robin van Persie officially arrived at Manchester United from Arsenal on Friday, declaring he was ""honored"" to be spearheading the Old Trafford club's hunt for a 20th English league title. The Dutch striker is in line to make his United debut in Monday's Premier League fixture against Everton after signing a four-year deal until 2016. He has never won a league title with Arsenal -- where his only trophy was a domestic cup seven years ago -- or at his previous club Feyenoord. ""I am looking forward to following in the footsteps of so many great strikers, bringing my experience and playing my part to help the team compete for the biggest trophies in the game. I can't wait to get started,"" the 29-year-old said in an official statement. Van Persie, who finished last season as the English first division's top goalscorer with 30 goals, moved to Arsenal from the Netherlands in 2004. He went on to score 96 goals in 194 appearances, being named club captain last season. Which clubs will win Europe's top leagues? He had been linked with United's crosstown rivals, Premier League champions Manchester City, as well as Italian league winners Juventus. ""In these situations, when you have to make a hard decision in your life, I always listen to that little boy inside me. What does he want? That boy was screaming for Manchester United,"" Van Persie told reporters on Friday. ""Everyone knows me by now. I love football. I am quite principled in that perspective. It is always difficult to find the perfect match but I do feel this is the perfect match for me. ""Manchester United breathes football. If you look at all the players from Manchester United, the stadium and manager, my choice was made very soon."" Manchester City's Barcelona acquisition . United manager Alex Ferguson hopes Van Persie can combine with England forward Wayne Rooney, who finished second behind his new teammate in the goalscoring stakes last term with 27 goals. ""Robin is a world-class striker with a proven record in England and in European football,"" said Ferguson. ""His talents need no introduction to our fans -- he has scored a number of goals against us in some classic battles with his former club. His movement, finishing and all-round ability are outstanding. ""If you go back six months ago, I couldn't see us getting him. I thought Arsenal are not going to let him go. When I read he had refused a new contract, that is when we acted. It has been a long haul."" Following the recruitment of Van Persie, Ferguson drew parallels with United's current strike force and the group of goalscorers he had at his disposal when the club won a treble in 1999, being crowned European champions and English league and FA Cup winners. ""In 1999 I had Dwight Yorke, Andy Cole, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the four best strikers in Europe,"" Ferguson told reporters. ""We are going towards that now. They (Rooney and Van Persie) are two fantastic players and it will be great to have both of them. It gives us more strength and more combinations up front. ""It is a fantastic collection of players and hopefully I pick the right combinations. It is great to have a player of Robin van Persie's qualities to come into the squad. I am very pleased."" His arrival will almost certainly mean the departure of Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov, who was the Premier League's joint top scorer in 2010-11 but spent most of last season on the bench as Danny Welbeck and Javier Hernandez partnered Rooney. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will look to new signings Lukas Podolski of Germany and France's Olivier Giroud to fire the Gunners to a first trophy since beating United in the 2005 FA Cup final. ""We have regret because we have lost a great player,"" Wenger told a press conference ahead of Arsenal's season opener against Sunderland. ""He had only one year left on his contract and he wanted to go. We had anticipated this situation might happen therefore we have bought Podolski and Giroud. We were prepared."" Van Persie may not be the last player to leave the Emirates Stadium this transfer window, with reports suggesting midfielder Alex Song is on the verge of a move to Barcelona. When asked about Song's possible departure and a potential Arsenal move for Real Madrid's Nuri Sahin, Wenger responded: ""Both can happen."" Meanwhile, U.S. international Clint Dempsey is expected to leave Premier League club Fulham, having been linked with Liverpool. The 29-year-old attacking midfielder, who scored 23 goals in all competitions last season, has been fined for refusing to play in Saturday's opening game against Norwich, according to the UK Press Association.","Robin van Persie says he is ""honored"" to have signed for Manchester United .

"(CNN) -- This holiday season, the Colombian military is trying a unique angle to get guerrillas to lay down their arms: It is creating Christmas trees deep in the jungle in hopes the holiday spirit will tug the rebels back home. The first tree of ""Operation Christmas"" was decorated in the jungle of southern Colombia, the military said. Two units in two Blackhawk helicopters dropped in on a supply path that the guerrillas are known to use and picked a 25-meter (82-foot) tree to decorate with sparkling blue lights. A commercial made by the military shows the soldiers, dressed in camouflage uniforms and face paint, wrapping 2,000 lights around the branches and trunk. The tree was rigged with a motion sensor that will turn the lights on when someone walks by. A banner next to it says, . ""If Christmas can come to the jungle, you too can come home. Demobilize. At Christmas, everything is possible."" Officials hope the gesture will be enough to lure rebels away from the jungle. ""For us, the most important month is December,"" Colombian military spokeswoman Marcela Duran said. ""Many make the final decision about demobilizing this month."" She says that traditionally, the holiday season sees a larger number of defections as rebels reflect on the positives and negatives of their situation. When they were recruited, many of the rebels did not know that it would mean being isolated from their families, she added. The tactic is a shift from what has been an aggressive military campaign against the rebels this year. In September, a military raid claimed the life of the No. 2 leader in a Marxist guerrilla group that has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. Victor Julio Suarez Rojas, also known as Jorge Briceno Suarez and by the nom de guerre Mono Jojoy, was the military leader for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly called the FARC. It was one of a number of military successes for the government this year. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, a former defense minister, was known for his tough line against the rebels, but he also has a softer side, an analyst said. During his time as defense minister, the government began using billboards and radio advertisements in areas where the rebels operate at an unprecedented level, said Adam Isacson, senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America. Operation Christmas sounds a bit gimmicky, he said, but ""rather than trying to kill all the rank-and-file guerrillas, it's better to try to convince them to leave."" FARC leaders tell their followers that they will be killed if they turn themselves in, but the advertisements and Christmas trees give another message, he said. Despite the military successes this year, ""the challenge is that their recruitment at the youngest levels is very easy,"" Isacson said. The tree decorating is probably aimed at those young recruits. In all, 10 jungle trees throughout the country will be decorated as part of Operation Christmas. This year, 2,411 guerrillas have demobilized, including 140 during this holiday season, the military said. In 2009, a total of 2,638 rebels laid down their arms.","""Operation Christmas"" will decorate 10 trees in the jungle .

"(CNN) -- Moored on the waters of San Francisco Bay, just east of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge, is -- well, a mystery. Atop a barge docked at Treasure Island, site of a former Navy base, is a four-story structure made from shipping containers. The purpose of the structure remains unknown, but the safe money says Google is up to something on board. Officials won't say exactly what's going on there. But some sleuthing by the media in the tech-heavy Bay Area has pretty much nailed down that Google, headquartered about 40 miles south in Mountain View, California, is behind the project. Tech blog CNET reported as much on Friday, citing lease agreements, Treasure Island locals and ""tracking a contact tied to the project on LinkedIn."" News reports say an unknown company has been working on a major project, under tight security, in a hangar on Treasure Island since last year. Witnesses say materials from that hangar were transferred onto the barge. Google did not respond to a request to comment for this story. So, even if the suspicions about Google and the barge's mysterious cargo are correct, that leaves the obvious question: What are they building in there? Early speculation has centered on a data center. Google has banks of servers stored in warehouses all over the world, and floating data centers aren't unheard of. Sitting on that much water would provide an obvious source of cooling, which is a big concern for data centers, and possibly even a source of power. And Google has a patent for such a project. But San Francisco station KPIX, a CNN affiliate, threw a twist into the narrative, quoting unnamed ""sources close to the project"" as saying the structure will be retail space -- a sort of floating Google store. Google hopes to tow the structure across the bay to San Francisco, where it would be used to market Google Glass, the company's connected eyewear, KPIX reported. Google Glass, the company's big leap into wearable technology, puts computer capabilities into eyeglasses. The headsets so far have been released only to early testers and are expected to go on sale to consumers in the coming months. An official with the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission told KPIX that there have been discussions with Google about ""hypothetical operations"" on the bay. But work on the project suddenly stopped a few weeks ago. One possible reason: An insider close to the commission told KPIX that Google ""can't park this barge on the waterfront without a permit, and they don't have one.""","""Mystery barge"" on San Francisco Bay may be a Google project .

"(CNN) -- CNN Flims' ""An Unreal Dream: The Michael Morton Story,"" describes in chilling detail how a young father's life was turned upside down and forever changed after his wife was murdered and he was wrongly convicted of the crime. Like nearly all the 311 DNA exonerations in the United States, Morton's story exposes enormous flaws in the criminal justice system. Morton almost certainly would have never been convicted if the prosecutor had not failed to turn over critical evidence pointing to his innocence. But if there can be a silver lining to a situation in which someone serves nearly 25 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit, Morton's case has revealed a valuable tool for holding errant prosecutors accountable for their deliberate misconduct. Morton was exonerated of the 1986 murder of his wife, Christine, after DNA testing of a bloody bandana that was found in the woods near the couple's Williamson County, Texas, home was shown to contain the blood of Christine and Mark Allen Norwood. Norwood, who has an extensive criminal history, was subsequently convicted of Christine's murder. Based on DNA testing conducted during the Morton investigation, Norwood has also been charged with the long unsolved murder of another young wife and mother, Debra Baker, who was killed under chillingly similar circumstances two years after Christine Morton's murder. During the Innocence Project's investigation of Morton's case, we learned that the prosecutor, Ken Anderson, who was subsequently made a judge, failed to turn over evidence to Morton's attorney. That evidence was a detailed account of the murder from Morton's 3-year-old son Eric. Eric told his maternal grandmother that Morton was not the attacker. Other evidence that wasn't shared also pointed to a third-party assailant. Last month, in an extremely rare instance of a prosecutor being criminally punished, Anderson entered a plea ""not to contest"" proceedings of ""criminal contempt of court"" related to Morton's case, according to Williamson County, Texas, court documents.  Anderson was sentenced to 10 days in jail, a $500 fine, 500 hours of community service and was forced to permanently surrender his license to practice law. He had submitted his resignation from the bench a few weeks earlier. Read more about Morton's case and Ken Anderson's response . Texas was able to prosecute Anderson with criminal contempt because there was evidence he had violated a specific court order and made false statements to a judge. During the trial, when it became clear that Anderson was not planning to call the lead investigator in the case, Morton's trial lawyers became suspicious and brought it to the judge's attention. The court in turn ordered Anderson to turn over the investigator's complete report for it to review. At that time the judge also asked Anderson directly whether he had any evidence that would be favorable to the defense to disclose, and Anderson said he did not. Because there was evidence that Anderson violated a direct order of the court, he was charged through a unique Texas procedure called a Court of Inquiry with criminal contempt and concealment of official records for deliberately disobeying the trial judge's directives. Because court orders have been shown to be the key to holding prosecutors accountable, courts should routinely order prosecutors to look in their files or a specified police file for all exculpatory material and to disclose it in a timely fashion. The prospective standard for determining what is exculpatory should be a version of the American Bar Association Rule of Professional Responsibility 3.8(d) that by law applies to prosecutors in 49 states and the District of Columbia. It has been adopted by the Department of Justice, and requires prosecutors to disclose all evidence that ""tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense."" Most importantly, the order should clearly state that ""willful and deliberate failure to comply is punishable by contempt."" Wording here is significant. It means that negligent, inexperienced, stupid or even reckless prosecutors will not be held in contempt, but those few prosecutors who deliberately and willfully suppress exculpatory evidence can be. Experienced and ethical prosecutors will recognize that the issuance of such orders will be an effective tool for teaching new prosecutors about their obligations and will help expose those ""bad apple"" prosecutors who discredit the profession. These orders create a mechanism for judges to deal with unscrupulous prosecutors in a way that directly addresses the problem. In cases where there is a deliberate violation of such an order, judges can punish offenders directly through contempt citations. Because contempt is generally not subject to statutes of limitations, prosecutors can be punished even if it takes years -- or decades -- to uncover the failure to disclose, which happened in the Michael Morton case. The orders -- which are known as Brady orders -- also make it easier for state bar disciplinary systems to sanction prosecutors. Prosecutors yield enormous power over life and liberty, and there must be effective systems in place for making them accountable. While the number of prosecutors who deliberately break the rules is small, history shows they tend to be repeat offenders. If there is to be justice for Michael Morton and all the other people who have been wrongly convicted at the hands of unscrupulous prosecutors, every state and federal judge in the nation will start Brady orders tomorrow to deter those few prosecutors who would otherwise deliberately violate their ethical and legal duties. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Barry Scheck.","Michael Morton spent nearly 25 years in prison for a murder he didn't commit .

"(EW.com) -- James Cameron, in ""Avatar,"" is the one American filmmaker -- at least to my eyes -- who has truly knocked the 3-D ball out of the park. (Sorry, but I wasn't on board with Scorsese or Spielberg for their overly fussy and busy 3-D experiments, ""Hugo"" and ""The Adventures of Tintin."") So perhaps it's no surprise that with ""Titanic 3D,"" Cameron has once again engineered the rare effective -- and even tasteful! -- use of 3-D technology. In the early underwater scenes, when a robot-cam pokes around the wreck of the ""Titanic,"" with Bill Paxton and his team of hipster techies hovering in anticipation, the ocean debris flies right out at the audience. That, however, is the only time in the movie that Cameron uses 3-D to conjure a comin'-at-ya View-Master effect. For the rest of Titanic 3D, he employs the technology in a ''subtle'' way: to heighten the images and lend them a bold sculptural clarity. For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive. Of course, that might also be because no movie ever needed 3-D less than ""Titanic."" It was already a heightened spectacle, with images grand enough to sear themselves into your cinematic memory bank. As scrupulous a job as Cameron has done, I can't really say that I recommend ""Titanic 3D"" in order to experience this landmark movie with an added dimension. I recommend it, rather, for the opportunity to see, once again on the big screen, the only disaster film in history that can truly be called a work of art. It is also, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made. We hardly have the vocabulary to describe a cornball love story, built around images of catastrophe startling enough to make your eyes pop, that isn't just swoony or awesome but, in fact, profound. One that hits us on a primal level. That's ""Titanic."" Seeing it now, for the first time since 1997, I was slack-jawed at what an enthralling experience it still is. There are two ways that it now looks different -- and, if anything, they're both examples of how a movie can age almost karmically well. Fifteen years ago, the movie's class-war theme -- the swells in their tuxedoes lounging amid the Titanic's creamy classical splendor, versus the lugs in steerage, led by Leonardo DiCaprio's penniless rapscallion bohemian Jack -- seemed a fairly standard old-movie trope. Hollywood, after all, has never stopped fingering the rich as villains, and Cameron's portrayal of a gilded class seemed (intentionally) locked in its time. What a difference one global economic meltdown and the rise of our own gilded one percent makes! To me, Billy Zane's unctuous performance as Rose's jerk-of-high-finance fiancÃ© looks more resonant and less cartoonish than it did then. It now speaks to a sense of entitlement that's on the rise in our world. The other way that ""Titanic"" has gained with the years is that it's all but impossible to watch the sinking of the Titanic itself -- an instant human abyss almost beyond imagining -- without thinking of 9/11. And by that I don't mean to imply that Cameron, in some mystical way, anticipated the 21st century's most infamous day. I mean that it's more potently clear than ever that the levels of dread and tragedy he packed into this movie cannot be consigned to some iconic historical event from 1912. That kind of mass death and horror is something that technology, in different forms (a gargantuan ocean liner; a gargantuan building and a speeding airplane), makes possible, and always will. Then there's that love story. Some have called it callow, but I implore you to go back and see Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in this movie and watch how dazzlingly spontaneous and multi-faceted their chemistry is. DiCaprio seemed so much lighter then -- not because he was ganglier and less filled out, but because he didn't have the weight of superstardom hanging on him. His Jack, who has nothing and therefore nothing to lose, lives every moment in a state of cat-eyed discovery. And Winslet, as the adventurous rich girl Rose, is heartbreakingly lovely and determined: an angel on fire. In recent years, a hint of off-putting harshness has crept into Winslet's work (in ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""Mildred Pierce,"" she did too much gloomy suffering for our sins), but in ""Titanic"" she plays Rose as a spiky princess, trapped by privilege, who allows herself to melt like a girl and, in doing so, melts her own prison and finds herself as a woman. A starry-eyed youth romance that collides with history and disaster: That's the ''concept'' of ""Titanic."" Yet there's so much more going on in this movie, with its deftly structured mythological framework, its heart-of-the-ocean timelessness, and -- yes, I'll say it -- its hauntingly gorgeous Gaelic-pop theme music. The Titanic, that splendid vessel, is like the 20th century itself, launching forth in all its looming luxe and promise, with Jack as the symbolic new man on the rise -- the aristocrat of the spirit who uses his charm and talent to enter realms from which he would previously have been barred. Rose, with her hint of a Jane Austen dilemma (if she follows her bliss and goes off with Jack, it will leave her family in ruins), is the young feminist who now has the peril, as well as pleasure, of choice. And once the ship scrapes up against that iceberg, Cameron's filmmaking turns humanly brilliant, as the prospect of sudden death unmasks -- in the most touching and shocking ways -- who each and everyone on board really is. Jack's death scene in the water has the shuddery majesty of the greatest silent films, because it's a moment that touches how vulnerable and precious life really is. To watch ""Titanic"" again is to do nothing less than enter a movie and come out the other side, with one's spirit feeling just a little bit larger. Grade: A . See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- First it was Chinese tourists apparently being targeted by criminal gangs in Paris. Roma pickpocketing crews were reportedly picking on Chinese travelers because of their habit of carrying plenty of cash with them. Now the tables seem, in a way, to be turned. French authorities suspect Chinese organized criminals to be behind the circulation of thousands of fake tickets to Paris' Louvre -- the world's most visited art gallery -- in a scam worth hundreds of thousands of euros. The museum was alerted to the swindle at the beginning of August when a staff member became suspicious of a ticket handed over by a Chinese tour guide, France 24 reports. The ticket ""felt strange to the touch and the paper quality was not good. All our staff were immediately put on the alert,"" a Louvre spokesperson told Le Parisien. Upping their game . But the criminals behind the scam appear to have upped their game at some point -- or more than one gang is operating. Days later, the Louvre discovered fake tickets that at first appeared ""in every way identical to the genuine article,"" the spokesperson said. Then, at the end of August, Belgian customs officers seized more than 4,000 forged Louvre passes in a parcel from China. The counterfeit tickets being worth at least â‚¬36 ($48) each, that haul alone would have saved the scammers at least â‚¬144,000 (about $191,000). Read more: Chinese tourists targeted in Paris pickpocketing spate . The Belgian discovery has sparked a French criminal investigation into whether criminal gangs in China are collaborating with Chinese tour operators in Paris to profit from the fake tickets, the Louvre said. However, French officials are reportedly wary of commenting publicly on the investigation for fear of causing diplomatic embarrassment with China. Scope of scam uncertain . The Louvre as yet has no idea of the scope of the scam. ""Our tickets are valid for a year. There's no telling how many are in circulation and there's no way as yet of calculating the cost of this scam to the museum,"" the Louvre said. The gallery would ""enhance [its] anti-counterfeiting system"" in response to the forgeries, the gallery told the Beijing Times, emphasizing that it continued to welcome Chinese tourists. French diplomats may be right to tread warily around the incident. Comments on Chinese social media expressed concern about the damage the scam could do to China's image. ""Can you please stop forging? This is so embarrassing!"" read one post on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter (link in Chinese language only).

"(CNN) -- Deep in a remote, hot, dry patch of northwestern Australia lies one of the earliest detectable signs of life on the planet, tracing back nearly 3.5 billion years, scientists say. At that time, the Earth -- relatively speaking -- wasn't into its adulthood yet. Scientists estimate the planet formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago; minerals known as zircons, indicating water, and continents existed within 100 million and 200 million years after that on what was still a scalding planet. The existence of water suggests that life was possible. But what did it look like, and when did it start? The discovery from the Dresser Formation, a much examined outcrop of rocks in Western Australia's Pilbara region, documented in a paper published online this week in the Astrobiology journal may help answer those questions. New species discovered in Australian rainforest . It centers on something called microbially induced sedimentary structures, commonly shortened to the acronym MISS. It's a mouthful to many, but some scientists believe this phenomenon could be the key to finding the first demonstrable evidence of life. A MISS forms via a process involving microorganisms (found in what's called microbial mats) with rocks (or sediment), something that can only happens under certain conditions. As the study's lead author, Nora Noffke of Old Dominion University, notes, ""The signal of early life forms has been preserved more clearly in MISS"" compared with other prehistoric finds. Another unique thing about them, unlike some other geological phenomena, is that a MISS structure formed a few billion years ago can look much like one a few hundred-thousand years old. Yet another is that it can show not just evidence of one organism but an entire ecosystem, one in which living things coexisted with one another. That's exactly what the study's co-authors -- Noffke, Daniel Christian, David Wacey and Robert Hazen -- say they found in Australia, noting that ""this MISS displays the same associations that are known from modern as well as fossil"" finds. The MISS also shows microbes that act like ""modern cyanobacteria,"" which the co-authors explain are ""known to be the first oxygen-producing organisms in the fossil record."" Given all that, the scientists write: ""We conclude that the MISS in the Dresser Formation record a complex microbial ecosystem, hitherto unknown, and represent one of the most ancient signs of life on Earth."" Ancient African coins that could change history of Australia . The fact this find was in Western Australia is no accident. The area has long been a treasure trove for Earth scientists delving into the past. Stromatolites found in Warrawoona trace back about 3.45 billion years, while microfossils from Marble Bar go back to 3.47 billion years, notes University of Washington scientist Roger Buick. ""The Dresser Formation is the oldest rock succession of sedimentary rocks that was never affected by any tectonics,"" or big changes in the surface caused by earthquakes and the like, said Noffke. ""Those rocks were just sitting there, nothing ever happened to them. That means any life is nicely preserved."" The oldest MISS previously known, though, came from South Africa and dated to 3.2 billion years ago. That's young relative to the Dresser Formation find, which the Astrobiology report says is about 3.48 billion years old. 20 Australia discoveries . The fact this MISS from Australia has a very similar makeup to recent ones is telling, Noffke said. A pessimist may see this as indication that there's been little evolution in that respect over that very considerable stretch of time. On the flip side, this shows that things were pretty complex even way back then. ""It was not that individual cell that was fighting for itself,"" Noffke said. ""It was intelligent enough to function in this environment very, very successfully. If cells work together, they have access to a larger set of experiences."" The Australia discovery features ""a complex system of microbial mats,"" which are ""complex communities of microbes"" -- or extremely small living things -- ""usually organized into layers that can be seen with the naked eye,"" notes NASA. ""They were one of the earliest ecosystems on Earth."" The U.S. space agency is interested in MISS and microbial mats because scientists are looking for them on Mars to possibly show life once existed there. The Western Australia discovery could help in that regard, the latest study's authors point out, especially give ""the similarity of the early history of Earth and the early history of Mars."" ""If there was life,"" said Noffke, ""then MISS is one of the likely targets."" Rare 'Asian unicorn' caught on camera .","NEW: Discovery shows life was fairly complex 3.48 billion years ago, scientist says .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney went head-to-head on China, taxes, and jobs on Wednesday as the two campaigned throughout Ohio. Both sought to illustrate what the next four years would be like under their leadership as new polls indicated Obama exceeding 50% support among likely voters in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania. Those are all swing states that combined will account for nearly a quarter of the electoral votes needed to win the White House. Surveys suggest that Romney has lost his edge on the economy, the centerpiece of his campaign to highlight slow growth, trade tensions, and stubbornly high unemployment under Obama's leadership. The economy remains the top issue for Americans as well when it comes to their vote for president, but Romney says he's not worried about the new surveys. ""Polls go up and down, but frankly you're going to see the support that I need to become president on Election Day,"" Romney said in an interview with CNN National Political Correspondent Jim Acosta. His campaign pivoted back to the economy on Wednesday after two days of campaign themes centered around foreign policy with tensions over Libya, Iran and Syria dominating headlines as world leaders gathered at the United Nations. Romney's campaign released a new ad saying Obama's policies aren't working for most Americans and told a crowd near Columbus that there is a right way and a wrong way toward economic progress. ""I know what it takes to get this economy going again. I care about the people of America,"" Romney said. ""And the difference between me and President Obama is I know what to do and I will do what it takes to get this economy going."" At the American Spring Wire plant in Bedford Heights, Romney took a hard line against China over currency manipulation, saying it has pushed U.S. jobs overseas. He said, as president, he would adopt policies favorable to manufacturing in response to lost employment. Manipulating currency can make doing business overseas cheaper. ""And that is why one thing I will do from day one is label China a currency manipulator. They must not steal jobs in an unfair way."" The Obama administration alleges China has illegally subsidized automotive exports and undercut American suppliers. Ohio is a manufacturing center for auto parts. Industry research shows that 800,000 jobs in Ohio are tied to the auto industry, which also has railed against Chinese currency policies. Obama said his opponent's rhetoric on China was disingenuous. ""He says he's gonna take the fight to them, he's going to go after these cheaters, and I've got to admit, that message is better than what he has actually done about this thing,"" Obama said at Bowling Green State University. ""It sounds better than talking about all the years he spent profiting from companies that sent our jobs to China. The candidates also diverged on tax policy and the deficit. Obama vs. Romney: How they'd handle the $7 trillion fiscal cliff . Obama said Romney's economic policies - trickle down economics - would not work. Instead, Obama said he wanted to grow the economy ""from the middle out,"" not the top down, to chip away at the budget deficit. ""I want to keep taxes low for middle class families and working class families, but if we want to close the deficit, we have to ask people like me to spend a little bit more,"" Obama said. Obama won Ohio by five points in 2008, but the GOP answered back big in the 2010 midterm elections and took back the governor's office and five House seats held by Democrats. Early voting in Ohio starts on October 2, a day before the first presidential debate in Denver. Why Romney is losing must-win Ohio . As both Romney and Obama campaigned through Ohio, a Quinnipiac/CBS News/New York Times poll indicated the president leading Romney 53%-43% among likely voters in the state. Ohio, with 18 electoral votes, is crucial to winning the White House. In modern times, no Republican has won the presidency without carrying the state. It put George W. Bush over the top in his 2004 re-election and Obama won it four years ago by five points. The Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times survey in Florida indicates the president at 53% and Romney at 44%. Florida is another state that Obama turned from red to blue four years ago. Some partisan polling indicates a closer contest. In Pennsylvania, the new Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times survey puts the president at 54% and the former Massachusetts governor at 42%.

"(CNN) -- This week, Time magazine named Miley Cyrus a finalist for Person of the Year, the annual award bestowed on the person editors think has ""most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year."" A true testament to the global influence of twerking, she was the only nominee from the entertainment industry. Her co-nominees included Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, President Obama, Pope Francis, and gay rights activist Edith Windsor. The pope was the winner, but one thing's for certain: Miley Cyrus makes an impact. Regardless of whether you care about her latest performance or haircut or provocative, eyebrow-raising declaration to the press, it's likely you'll have heard about it. In part, that's owing to her affinity for ever-media-friendly shock, delivered in the form of a raunchy, nudity-filled music video; a raunchy, nudity-filled photo shoot with photographer Terry Richardson; and a raunchy awards show performance that likely would have contained some nudity had it been allowed. It did, however, contain a foam finger and a latex bodysuit. And a tongue that was a performer of its own. Shocking behavior isn't uncommon in the entertainment industry, and especially in music. Shock, like sex, sells. But it's quite possible Cyrus isn't selling just shock, and albums. She's also selling drugs. Earlier this year, Miley ended months of speculation that one of her song lyrics referred to ""Molly,"" the nickname for psychedelic drug MDMA, or a form of Ecstasy. When she was asked if she was referring to her own name or the drug Molly in the song ""We Can't Stop,"" she told The Daily Mail, ""If you're aged 10, it's 'Miley.' If you know what I'm talking about, then you know."" In September, she offered a second endorsement, telling Rolling Stone that marijuana and Molly are ""happy drugs -- social drugs. They make you want to be with friends."" What effect might the former Disney star's drug advocacy have on the legions of tween and teen fans who follow her every move? A 2008 study looking at the influence of technology, media and pop culture on criminal behavior concluded that while young people are influenced by pop culture, and more so than adults, it was difficult to empirically study the cause and effect of pop culture on their behavior. And certainly, the glorification of vice in music is not at the hands of Miley Cyrus alone: A 2008 study out of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine found that 33% of the top 300 songs on the top of the Billboard charts portrayed drug or alcohol use -- an increasing number of them pop songs -- which means that kids receive about 35 references to substance abuse for every hour of music they listen to. That said, what we do know: Exposure to excessive violence in video games can increase aggressive attitudes, behaviors and values, particularly in children. And adolescent exposure to music, a powerful social force often linked to identity, memories and mood, is much more frequent than it is to any other form of pop culture. According to the Pittsburgh School of Medicine study, most teens listen to an average of 16 hours each week of music, compared with about six hours each week for movies. Perhaps more than any other entertainment medium, the study authors wrote, ""music is well known to connect deeply with adolescents and to influence identity development."" And so it's hard not to argue that Molly is likely reaping the benefits. The numbers are there: A 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that 12.4% of Americans between 18 and 25 had experimented with MDMA, while a report released last week by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration stated that emergency room visits related to MDMA increased 128% between 2005 and 2011 among people younger than 21. ""Everyone wants to try it,"" a recent Teen Vogue article quoted a 19-year-old named Samantha as saying, and indeed many are: In recent months, there were multiple suspected MDMA-related deaths and hospitalizations reported along the East Coast, and in October, MDMA was linked to 10 Chicago-area deaths. Music might not make kids do drugs. But it's naÃ¯ve to think that music isn't having an impact on kids' behavior and perception -- and that all this attention Cyrus is getting isn't teaching them something about what it takes to get noticed. (Meanwhile, all the attention MDMA is getting will, naturally, serve to pique curiosity.) Cyrus is an adult. She can sing about and ingest whatever she wants -- but naming her a Person of the Year? Well, it's a tough pill to swallow. Unless, of course, you're a drug named Molly. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Peggy Drexler: That Miley Cyrus was a finalist for Person of the Year shows her impact .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's army said Sunday it has killed 60 ""terrorists"" as it battles to wrest control of part of the country from the Taliban. Five soldiers were killed in the last 24 hours of the assault, the military said. Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, pictured in November 2008. But the Taliban claimed they had killed 68 Pakistani security forces in the last day. Pakistani Taliban spokesman Azam Tariq told CNN by phone that only one Taliban fighter had been killed and three injured in that time. He said the Taliban had killed the Pakistani troops with roadside bombs and in combat. He said the anti-government forces had ""huge quantities"" of weapons ""which we got during the war against Russia and it is sufficient for us for many years,"" he said, presumably referring to the Soviet Union's 1979-1989 occupation of Afghanistan. Pakistani troops launched the massive ground offensive backed by air power this weekend in South Waziristan, a refuge and a power base for insurgents operating in Pakistan and along the Pakistani-Afghan border. The highly anticipated offensive comes after a wave of suicide attacks in Pakistan. It has prompted the exodus of tens of thousands of civilians, the U.N. refugee agency said. Although the offensive is not the first, it is the most important, military spokesman Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN, ""because we have concluded that this area has become the center of gravity of the problem."" Pakistan said it was not targeting civilians. ""In some areas, people (including women) raised white flags; they were left off after search,"" Pakistan said in a statement. One military official said Pakistani troops seized control of Kotkai, the home village of Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, where Mehsud has lived with fellow Taliban commander Qari Hussein. Hussein is the mastermind of some of Pakistan's deadliest suicide attacks. Airstrikes from jet fighters and helicopter gunships targeted militant hideouts in Kotkai and the villages of Badar, Barwand, and Khisur -- all strongholds of the Taliban and their late leader Baitullah Mehsud, another official told CNN.  Watch how the offensive began » . The officials asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media. Four Pakistani soldiers were killed and 12 others were wounded on the first day of the battle, the military said. The ground offensive in South Waziristan was launched Saturday morning after the military received clearance from the government, said Gen. Athar Abbas, the Pakistan military spokesman. He said the region's eight entry and exit points have been sealed by troops. Asked by CNN about the potential that the Taliban militants might flee, Abbas said, ""there's a huge presence of security forces in the area."" When the main arteries in and out of the area are closed and the militants' freedom is restricted, ""I think half the battle is over for them,"" he said. But the government doesn't want help from U.S. drones, he said. ""The policy of the government is very clear,"" Abbas said. ""... The government feels it does more harm than it helps."" A peace deal is not an option, according to Abbas. When militants lay down their arms and surrender, ""only then it will be accepted you are not fighting,"" he said. Pakistani officials said about 10,000 to 15,000 militants linked to the Taliban or to al Qaeda operate in South Waziristan, a harsh terrain familiar to militants but difficult for others to navigate. About 28,000 Pakistani soldiers have moved into the epicenter of Taliban activity in the region to counter their activities, officials said. Elsewhere in Pakistan's tribal region -- in the Mohmand Agency -- at least eight militants and one soldier were killed on Saturday when they exchanged gunfire near a military checkpost, the military said. For months, the military had been targeting militant hideouts in South Waziristan and other hotspots in Pakistan's tribal areas. Earlier this year, troops launched a large operation targeting militants in the Swat Valley, in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province. But despite these efforts, insurgents have continued to strike with relative impunity inside Pakistan, brazenly targeting government, police and security locations. The latest attack occurred Friday in the northern city of Peshawar, when a suicide car bomber detonated near a police station, killing 13 people -- most of them civilians. The recent wave of deadly attacks has raised concerns about the ability of Pakistan's security forces to maintain control. The attacks heightened internal and international pressure on the government to take swift and effective action. On Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama approved an additional $7.5 billion in assistance to Pakistan over the next five years.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Photographer Ahn Sehong walks into the Nikon building in Tokyo with his photos under his arm. They're pictures of elderly women, part of his exhibit that was scheduled to take place at the Nikon gallery. That is, until Nikon canceled it without explanation. It's not the quality of his work that's the problem, says Sehong, but the content. Sehong's photographs are portraits of the Korean women known as comfort women, victims who were forcibly taken from Korea and used as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during WWII. Now 80 to 90 years old, they're the living but dwindling history of the decades-old war crimes. Some Japanese extremists believe the crimes against the comfort women never happened. Others would prefer to stop discussing Japan's ugly war history in modern times. Sehong knocks on the door of the Nikon gallery manager's office. A middle-aged man opens the door. The gallery manager knows who Sehong is and asks him to wait. He closes the door. ""In the beginning I was angry and frustrated,"" says Sehong, referring to receiving the notice that his exhibit was canceled, as he waits outside the manager's door. ""But this is not a matter of being angry. I believe there is a problem with the Japanese government. They're discriminating against the comfort women."" The letter Sehong received didn't state why the exhibition was canceled, and while Nikon told CNN that public complaints had been lodged before its planned opening, a representatives said that wasn't the reason the exhibition was pulled. Sehong's pictures are emotional but don't appear to make a political statement about the Japanese. In one portrait, a woman appears to be crying. Her face is deeply lined, her back slouched with age, her hands spotted with freckles. The picture is black and white, carrying a timelessness that betrays the endless grief the woman carries. It is just one of dozens of portraits of the elderly, poverty-stricken Korean women, quietly living out their twilight years in rural China. ""The reason I do this work is for these grandmothers,"" says Ahn. ""The government and some Japanese people just hope these women will die and history will be erased. It's not right."" Japan has a track record of downplaying its war crimes. Most recently, Japan's government says two delegations met with the mayor of Palisades Park, New Jersey, asking the city to remove a memorial dedicated to comfort women. The city says the Japanese officials offered cherry blossom trees if the city would take down the memorial, a small, unremarkable rock that has a single bronze etching on the side. The city says it refused the offer. Japan's government would not confirm it offered Palisades Park any gift in exchange for the removal of the memorial. The move, widely reported through the Korean American community, reopened old wounds. ""They think it's an anti-Japanese monument, trying to attack Japan, but it's not,"" says Chejin Park, staff attorney for the Korean American Civic Empowerment, based in New York. ""We don't want to repeat that kind of massive, government-organized human trafficking. The only way we can stop that kind of human rights violation is remembering that human rights violation. The best way to remember it is to have a memory of it."" Korean American activists say Japan needs to accept and properly acknowledge its war crimes instead of trying to eradicate its history. The Palisades Park effort backfired on Japan, says Park. ""Their request was helpful for our movement. It's helping us to do more things for the comfort women issue. Many more communities now want to have memorials in their communities."" Japan's government has formally apologized on numerous occasions for the atrocities against the women. Japan helped establish the Asian Women's Fund in 1995, which is supported by government funds and provides assistance to comfort women. The AWF has received donations from Japanese people equaling US$7 million. Japan has resisted direct payments to individual victims, leading to complaints among activists and victims that the country appears to be avoiding officially acknowledging its history. The lack of direct reparations continues to support a culture of discrimination against the women, say activists. That's why Ahn believes Nikon could so easily cancel his photographic memorial to the women. Nikon's gallery manager reappears out of his office and tells Ahn his exhibit remains canceled. He won't explain why. Ahn is disappointed. He had hoped to teach young Japanese people about their history and challenge them to reconcile it. ""These grandmothers were forced into slavery 70 years ago,"" says Ahn. ""They lived and survived alone. Afterwards, no one remembers them."" Ahn gathers his pictures and heads to the gallery's exit. ""Will they be blown away in a bleak wind and dispersed and vanished to the back stage of history?""","Nikon cancels a photo exhibition by Ahn Sehong on Japan's comfort women in Tokyo .

"(CNN) -- The year is 2063. By now, all of Europe's volcanoes have come to life and erupted, spewing out thick plumes of ash into the atmosphere. Dense black clouds of dust envelop the murky sky, plunging the entire continent into total darkness. The whole of Europe lies in a pile of rubble. There is no sun here, the air is polluted, unbreathable, and chaos has descended -- to survive, one must flee south, to the only place where the sun continues to shine: Africa. Set five decades from now, Usoni is a Kenya-based TV production that turns the issue of migration to Europe upside down. The futuristic show depicts Africa as mankind's last cradle of hope in the wake of a series of natural disasters. Usoni follows the compelling story of Ophelia and Ulysse, a young couple who are desperately trying to escape Europe's terrible conditions and head to Africa, the land of the sun that holds the promise of a better future for them and their unborn child. Setting off from Lampedusa, the Mediterranean port serving as the gateway to the African oasis, the two protagonists embark on an arduous journey fraught with peril and sacrifice as they try to reach Lake Turkana in east Africa. Read this: 'Star Wars' town swallowed by desert . Usoni creator Marc Rigaudis, a Kenya-based French filmmaker and author, says the show is portraying the reversal of immigration trends against the backdrop of climate change and stagnant economies. ""It's put in the future just to talk and show what is happening now,"" says Rigaudis. ""The message is very strong and universal,"" he adds. ""It's putting the world in front of the mirror, like exposing the injustices of the world for so many centuries -- everything is very symbolic."" Reversing trends . Nothing is more symbolic than setting the story's opening scenes in Lampedusa. The small Italian island on the southern edge of Europe is a frequent destination for refugees seeking to enter EU countries. Each year, tens of thousands of people set out on crammed and rickety wooden boats to cross the rough waters of the Mediterranean Sea, fleeing poverty and conflict in search for a better life. The journey is dangerous and deadly shipwrecks are common -- more than 300 African migrants died last October after their ship sank off Lampedusa's shores. Read this: 'Half of a Yellow Sun' on big screen . ""I was looking at those people crossing the sea from Africa, taking so many risks and getting killed in the process,"" says Rigaudis, explaining how he came up with the idea for Usoni. ""If they don't get killed, they come to Europe which supposedly is going to give them a better way of life. Most of the times this is not the reality and their harassment is continuing,"" he adds. ""This is so unjust, when you think that Europe has made a lot of its wealth and power from places like Africa and now these people -- who are living on one of the richest continents of the world and shouldn't be poor -- have to move because the way things are being done,"" continues Rigaudis. ""I thought that was so unfair, and then I started thinking it would be interesting if all of a sudden this was reversed."" Changing perceptions . Rigaudis, who's written several books in the past and made films in Japan and Kenya, including a documentary about the last surviving members of the El Molo tribe in Lake Turkana, had originally developed the concept for a feature film. But when he was appointed last year as film productions director at Nairobi's United States International University (USIU), he decided to give the topic of his film to his students to help them get working in a professional way. Together, the experienced professor and the energetic students adapted the idea into a TV series and named it Usoni, which means ""future"" in Swahili. Guided by Rigaudis, the 22-member student crew filmed a 30-minute pilot episode last October and November in locations around Nairobi and Mombasa. Cherie Lindiwe, the 21-year-old director of Usoni, says the show's concept could resonate with people across the world, not just Africans. ""It's basically a story that people could watch and then form a discussion and critique, giving them the chance to talk about the issues that really matter in the society,"" she says. ""We want to talk to people living abroad, to people living in the West, to change their perceptions in what they think about Africa, and also to give a message of hope to Africans."" While Rigaudis is still planning to turn his idea into a feature film, dubbed ""Future,"" he is also in discussions with Kenyan and international channels about developing it into a full series to air on TV. One condition, he says, is that this must be an African production, if it eventually gets picked up. ""On top of everything I would like to show on this film, the message I'd want to give to the world is that we can do something like this in Africa,"" says Rigaudis. ""I really want to have the production in Africa, with Africans, instead of having a film about Africa from outside,"" he adds. ""We can make very beautiful films -- there is everything here to make a beautiful cinema."" The pilot episode of Usoni, which was first screened in late November at USIU, will have its premiere Monday at the Alliance Francaise, the French cultural center in Nairobi.

"(CNN) -- This is not how Stanislas Wawrinka dreamed it would go. He hadn't dared to imagine beating the two finest players in men's tennis to become a grand slam champion. The unassuming Swiss hadn't even pictured climbing to No. 3 in the world rankings. Eclipsing his decorated compatriot Roger Federer as Switzerland's top tennis player had never crossed his mind either. But that was before Sunday, before Wawrinka beat Rafael Nadal in four sets to become the Australian Open champion. ""I never dreamed about that, never expected to be in that situation and that's just crazy,"" the 28-year-old told CNN, the day after his 6-3 6-2 3-6 6-3 over world No. 1 and 13-time major winner Nadal. ""You don't really know what's happening, I started to tell myself 'You just won a grand slam.' It's something amazing for me."" Wawrinka even had to take a second glance at the rankings to confirm he hadn't been dreaming of his new elevated status in the top four of the men's games. ""Just checking!!!"" he tweeted on Monday. He needn't have worried. Wawrinka, seeded eighth in Melbourne, comfortably took the first two sets but surrendered a third to Nadal, who was playing through the pain barrier with his movement restricted by a back injury sustained in the warm up . Despite his best efforts Nadal lacked the power to punish his opponent and Wawrinka eventually found himself serving to become Switzerland's second male grand slam champion. ""I had to really take my time, focus on each point,"" explained Wawrinka, who after breaking Nadal for a second time in the fourth set punched himself a few times in the head -- seemingly urging himself to concentrate. ""He broke me the game before, I was rushing a little bit. I had new balls. I knew it was all on me. ""I knew my serve was good yesterday. Before match point I took my time, enjoyed the crowd a little bit and tried to make a good plan to win the last point."" A forehand was enough for Wawrinka to seal success, a new high in a career which also includes men's doubles Olympic triumph with Federer in 2008. ""The Olympics will always be something special for me because it was my first big victory, with Roger, a good friend, playing for Switzerland,"" he said. ""I'm always proud to play for Switzerland and that will always be something really special. But I have to say right now, winning a grand slam title ... I'm really happy with that.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In the usually sleepy world of Hong Kong stock exchange filings, a new document is gaining attention for its unintentionally hilarious descriptions of nightclub life. The 378-page prospectus lays out the risks and potential rewards of investing in a new stock offering for ""Magnum Entertainment Group Holdings,"" the owner of three nightclubs in Hong Kong. In doing so, the document puts exact definitions on terms that may seem obvious to anyone who has ever stayed out past midnight. Clubs, for example, are defined as establishments that include ""a dance floor and high-energy music."" The prospectus elaborates, explaining that ""they are equipped with DJ booths where music that is intended to motivate customers to dance is played, and the volume of such music is usually high."" Club-goers apparently tend to buy lots of beverages, including champagne and something called a cocktail, which is ""generally known as alcoholic beverages served by glass and prepared by bartenders mixing different alcohol and ingredients."" Want to understand more late-night lingo? The prospectus tells us ""there has been a trend of 'club-hopping' developing in Hong Kong in recent years which means customers have the tendency to visit multiple clubs in one night."" VIPs are given special privileges, including free entry, discounts and other perks. ""For instance, the managers of the Clubs may assist VIP Customers to store their unfinished bottle of liquor or wine upon request."" Another great revelation? In addition to liquor licenses, Hong Kong clubs are required to have ""dancing endorsements."" Without such permission, it seems the club could turn into a scene out of ""Footloose."" Of course, the prospectus isn't supposed to be a guide to Hong Kong nightlife. The document is aimed at potential shareholders, not potential clubgoers. With Magnum shares already trading at nearly twice the offering price, those investors may be laughing all the way to the bank.","Prospectus on three nightclubs in Hong Kong contain descriptions of nightlife .

"(CNN) -- Japanese star pitcher Masahiro Tanaka is only 25. He just pitched a perfect 24-0 season with a 1.27 ERA. For non baseball fans, that's unbelievable form. It's thanks to this form that he's signed a seven-year, $155 million contract with the famous New York Yankees -- a young player with the best years of his career ahead of him. But some U.S. baseball watchers are skeptical. The reason? Tanaka has thrown a worryingly high number of pitches. According to Sports Illustrated's Tom Verducci, Tanaka has thrown more innings at a young age than anybody in the major leagues in few decades. As a pro, the Japanese star had thrown 1,315 innings by age 24, a number unrivaled by virtually any young player today. Even as a high schooler Tanaka was a powerhouse: during Japan's Koshien Tournament he set a national record with an astonishing 742 pitches in 6 games. Unlike in American baseball, where pitchers are often warned that throwing too many times leads to early injury, Tanaka has played for years in a Japanese sporting culture that values repetition as a way to achieve perfection. ""The [Japanese] philosophy is repetition, hard work: If I put in more, it's going to make a better pitcher and it's going to take care of everything,"" explained Japan-based pitching instructor Lyle Yates, to MLB Network Radio. ""It's not in my opinion always focused properly, and the body does need recovery time,"" he added. Today, few American pitchers exceed 100 pitches in a game. Yet in a recent game in Japan, Tanaka threw 160 pitches - and topped it off with another 15 pitches the very next day. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman acknowledged in a conference call with reporters there were ""concerns"" about those two games. ""But with his age, his talent and the scouting assessment, and with the pitching market the way it is, we were willing to take the risk,"" he said. Reaction on social media was divided. ""Yankees overpaid for Tanaka 1300+ innings and he's only 24. That's got Tommy John written all over it,"" wrote Twitter user @Derick_Anderson, referencing the nickname for the elbow surgery first undergone by former major league pitcher Tommy John. ""Tanaka's usage isn't that much different than prospects or even major league pitchers of similar pedigree and age. He will be fine,"" argued Twitter user @bkblades. In the end, it's clear Tanaka is ready to prove his own worth. ""I cannot speak English, but I would like to appeal with my performance,"" Tanaka told reporters in Japan Thursday. ""I hope I can perform what I have built up so far on the pitcher's mound.""","Yankees' newest pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, 25, is a star pitcher in Japan .

"(CNN) -- For two years, Google has pushed its Google+ as more than a social network or cool video-chatting tool. This week, it is working to hammer home that point with a spate of new features. Google+ isn't an answer to Facebook or Twitter, Google says. It's the connective tissue that more and more is tying Google's most popular products together -- and it will not be ignored. Since it debuted in June 2011, Google+ has seeped into all other parts of the Google ecosystem, tying into other Google offerings like search, Gmail and YouTube. Sometimes the product feels like an invasive species, especially when using it is required to benefit from the coolest features in other Google products. ""I'm not sure that it's forced. I think there are some people who may have a misunderstanding of what we're trying to accomplish,"" said Vic Gundotra, the Google senior vice president who leads Google+. Creating one unified Google identity for each user is the primary purpose of Google+. When the project was started, the company was trying to solve the problem of disconnected online identities. ""One of the core insights we had when we started Google+ was that Google itself was deeply fragmented,"" said Gundotra. ""Google treated identity as something that was fragmented and different, when (people) were on YouTube they had one identity, when they were on Android they had a different identity, when they were on Gmail they were someone else, when they used search they weren't even logged in."" But the reality is that many people still have multiple online identities and Gmail addresses. There might be one for work, another for personal, and a dedicated e-mail address for signing up for services and e-mail lists to collect all the resulting spam in one convenient bucket. Instead of giving those up and using one Google identity, many people choose to juggle their accounts. To get people to use Google+ the way Google imagines it, the company is working to make the benefits of using one primary Google identity too good to ignore. During Wednesday's Google I/O developer's conference keynote address, Google+ played a big part in many of the more exciting product announcements, even though it wasn't always called out. The redesigned version of Google Maps will recommend restaurants based on what your Google+ friends have reviewed and visited. The new Google Music All Access service will also use your social graph to hone in on music you might enjoy. ""That unification of Google, of bringing Google together, makes for amazing things,"" said Gundotra. One feature demonstrated on stage was a voice search for a person's recent vacation photos. If you are logged into Google Search under the same e-mail you use for Google+, and if you also use Google+ to upload and share your personal photos, you can get these types of customized search results. Those tie-ins could play a more important role in getting people to embrace, not just grudgingly accept, Google+ than the service's stand-alone features. However, a lot is being done to improve the stand-alone Google+ experience. On Wednesday, Google unveiled a sleek new redesign, some very impressive photo tools, and a feature that automatically combs posts on the social network and adds appropriate hashtags. In an impressive Googley twist, it can even identify what's in a photograph to add hashtags like ""concert"" or ""cat."" When there is breaking news, like the Boston bombing, people will refer to it with different terms and finding out more information requires you to leave Google+. That's in stark contrast to Twitter, current king of breaking news, where hashtags and discovery tools make it easy to stay on top of important events in real time. ""You've got to figure out how to canonicalize that 'bombing in boston,' 'disaster boston,' 'marathon disaster,' are all the same thing. And you have to bring all of that together and then say, this is the recommended tag. And if you click on it, we understand the related entities. That's a deep understanding of the knowledge graph. In real time, as its happening,"" said Gundotra . In addition to trying to clean up user identities and make Google+ a more engaging experience, Google+ is also unifying existing Google products that overlap. The new Hangouts messenger service allows people to chat via text, share photos, and talk over video with one or multiple people, between phones, tablets and desktops. Instead of separate products for Video Hangouts, Google Talk and Google Messenger, there is just one tool. This new product could take on existing chat platforms like WhatsApp and BlackBerryMessenger, though Gundotra said that wasn't its main goal. ""Obviously, we knew that there were real time communications products. We're not going to tell you we didn't know that there were these products out there. We were watching the growth of them and that was powerful data for us, that there was a need out there for a better solution,"" said Gundotra. ""Frankly we were looking at our own problems, and our customers were telling us, Google: Unify these things"" Gundotra said.","Google Senior Vice President Vic Gundotra explains the real goal behind Google+ .
All the big Google product announcements tied into the social network in some small way .
The social network is Google's attempt to clean up fragmented user accounts ."
"(CNN) -- Something was different in 2013. Unlike recent years, when some of the major events were powered by groups and movements -- think revolutions that seemed to materialize out of nowhere, public squares occupied without visible leadership -- this year, it was individuals who created the most unexpected or dramatic events. Some of this year's crucial stories resulted from the interaction of individuals challenging institutions, organizations or the status quo. Sometimes they failed miserably. Other times, they succeeded. But mostly they gave a shove to history, trying to knock it onto a different path. These are my candidates for what defined 2013: . The spies got out-spied . Edward Snowden hadn't yet turned 30 when he threw back the curtain, exposing the astonishing scale of surveillance by the National Security Agency. While the NSA had its sights on other things, a single contractor in its midst triggered an earthquake. Snowden left his NSA job with hundreds of thousands of documents, revealing how the NSA was gobbling up ""meta-data,"" records of telephone calls and e-mails, even from world leaders and U.S. allies. The revelations showed an almost omnipotent NSA, capable of learning any of our secrets. And yet, it bared an agency that could be embarrassingly bested by a single man. To some a hero, to others a traitor, Snowden forced an examination of how far society is willing to allow the government to spy on people's lives. If Snowden didn't act, would we have slipped quickly and easily into an Orwellian state without knowing what our government had been doing? A Pope more concerned with inequality than sexuality . In March, Catholic cardinals gathered in Rome to choose an Argentine priest as the new Pope, the first non-European pope in nearly 1,300 years. Pope Francis has emerged as the most innovative pope in living memory. CNN Poll: Pope's approval rating sky high . He is challenging the mighty forces of tradition in the Church, wearing a benevolent smile while surely facing murmurs of dissent behind Vatican walls. The Pope decried the Church's obsession with homosexuality, abortion and birth control, prodding Catholics to fight poverty and inequality instead. He has become an endless source of surprises, phoning his newspaperman to cancel his subscription, paying his hotel bill in person and refusing to move to the papal residence. Can Pope Francis succeed in bringing lasting changes to one of the world's oldest, most conservative institutions? We will find out. Struggling Iran pulls a rabbit out of the hat . The dispute with Iran over its nuclear weapons began a new chapter with the surprise election of Hassan Rouhani. The new Iranian President sharply shifted to conciliatory tones, but much doubt remains about whether that will result in real changes. Obama put the odds for a final deal at 50/50. It is Rouhani's boss, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in Iran. Nothing happens without his approval, not even a change of tone. It is not clear he has decided to change the goals of Iran's nuclear program. Almost two decades have passed since the United States and other countries started imposing sanctions on Iran, aiming to prevent what they believe -- and Iran denies -- is a nuclear weapons program. Iran and the Washington-led world powers made an interim deal to slow some of Iran's progress for six months and roll back some sanctions. That created excitement in some quarters and consternation in others, especially because Iran appears to have found a way to continue enriching uranium even though the United Nations had specifically demanded it stop. Who wins? Some would say Iran, thanks to Rouhani. Obama scored self-goal with Obamacare rollout . When it comes to individuals challenging the status quo, the President of the United States is not exactly Everyman, but Barack Obama took on the system and then trampled himself in it. The story might have been the political dysfunction and the government shutdown that left Americans disgusted with Washington. Obama seemed to be scoring points after standing firm against Republicans. What tripped him most painfully required no intervention from his critics. It was the disastrous rollout of the signature achievement of his presidency, the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. When Americans stopped shaking their heads at the shutdown, they discovered the Obamacare rollout disaster unfolding. Obama's approval rating took a plunge, made steeper by his initial denial that there was a problem. When a contrite Obama declared ""That's on me,"" he found little disagreement. In Syria, Obama fumbled and al-Assad stays in power . When 2012 drew to a close, we knew the suffering of the Syrian people was nowhere near its end. Who would have guessed that by the end of 2013, the Syrian regime would be strengthened? After calling for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down in the face of mounting deaths, Obama, along with much of the West, seemed to have no clear idea what to do next. He worried that the opposition fighting against his dictatorship would give rise to a new regime dominated by Islamist extremists. Obama drew a ""red line,"" saying the use of chemical weapons by al-Assad would change his calculus. Then al-Assad used chemical weapons, and Obama announced he had decided the United States had to intervene. Obama is not a natural risk-taker. When he decided to take action in Syria, he went out on a limb, but quickly he reversed course, afraid to challenge public opinion. He surprised everyone with the announcement that he would await congressional authorization. The congressional green light looked doubtful when Secretary of State John Kerry off-handedly suggested intervention could be prevented if al-Assad surrendered his chemical weapons. Syria's ally Russia picked up the idea and launched into a diplomatic offensive that saved al-Assad from Western attack and saved Obama from political shame. As Russia's Vladimir Putin made his victory lap, the Syrian people continued to endure relentless assault by al-Assad and his Lebanese ally, Hezbollah. The death count has continued to climb, and the winter weather is adding to the misery of Syria's civilians. Putin outwitted Obama, and another dictator gets the last laugh. As we look back on 2013, it's worth remembering that we are all not just witnesses; we are the protagonists of our time in history. Individuals can change history, for better or worse.

"(CNN) -- Today, August 19, the world's top bartenders will compete at the International Bartender's Association's World Cocktail Championship in Prague, shaking, stirring, pouring and flaring in their attempts to make 2013's best cocktail. To mark the occasion, we've found 12 weird and wonderful cocktails worth seeking out around the world. Doug Laming's Margarita . There are apparently only two Cointreau Caviar Spherification Kits in Australia, and the Rabbit Hole Bar has one of them. This magical piece of kit allows barmen to create pearls of booze that burst in the mouth. ""I love the different reactions you receive from first-time patrons when you bring it to the table,"" says Matthew Smith, assistant manager at the Rabbit Hole Bar. Barmen use sodium alginate, calcium lactate and the spherification kit to create balls of Cointreau. Other cocktails served include a ""Jellied G & T"" -- a jelly cube of Hendricks' gin. Rabbit Hole Bar, 82 Elizabeth St, Sydney NSW 2000; +61 02 8084 2505; Doug Laming's Margarita: $11 . Coquetier . Served in an eggshell, the ingredients for this drink include rum, chocolate and cinnamon. Antoine Amédée Peychaud was an apothecary known for the brandy toddies he served out of egg cups at New Orleans Masonic gatherings in the 18th century. Two hundred years later, the team at Pret a Diner have recreated this historic cocktail. The key ingredients are rum, chocolate, cinnamon and of course the chicken egg in which the cocktail is served. Fans of the drink include supermodel Bar Refaeli. Pret a Diner, Zinnowizerstr.7, Mitte district, Berlin, Germany; Coquetier: $9.30 . Camel milk cocktail . A non-alcoholic cocktail originally created for Muslims fasting during Ramadan. Compared to cows' milk, camel milk is three times as rich in Vitamin C and is full of iron, unsaturated fatty acids and B vitamins. The camel milk drinks will be available after Ramadan at Mijana, the Ritz-Carlton's Arabic restaurant. ""Camel milk mixologist"" Mohammad Daoud originally created his range of camel milk cocktails for Muslims celebrating Ramadan.

The Sour Toe cocktail served by the Sourtoe Cocktail club can be any drink -- what turns it into the Sour Toe cocktail is the addition of a real, preserved amputated toe, which is dropped into the glass. Although nobody seems sure of the origins of the drink, it first appeared in 1973 when drinkers who consumed a glass of Champagne or beer that contained the toe could then declare themselves true ""sourtoers."" Today, the toe can be placed in any drink but one rule still applies: ""You can drink it fast, you can drink it slow -- but the lips have gotta touch the toe.""

"(CNN) -- Life is good for Maria Sharapova right now. She's won two titles this year, added a new lucrative new sponsorship deal -- and has finally confessed to tennis' worst-kept secret, that she is dating young men's star Grigor Dimitrov. They were caught kissing in Madrid the day after he beat world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, and she playfully wrote on a television camera after her Friday quarterfinal win in the Spanish capital: ""How did you catch us??"" While the 21-year-old Dimitrov was unable to follow up his shock victory, Sharapova has cruised into the final of the women's tournament after beating former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic 6-4 6-3 on Saturday. ""We're official. We've been seeing each other for a while,"" the world No. 2, who has been fending off questions about their relationship since January, told reporters after the 500th victory of her career. ""You know, it's just news to us that someone took a picture of us now after this time. It's nice to have something in life that you're able to have for yourself, because so much of your lives are in the public eye."" Sharapova has never before played in the final of the Madrid tournament, and faces a daunting task if she is to lift the trophy on Sunday. Her opponent is defending champion Serena Williams, who has the beaten Russian in their last 11 meetings -- including March's final in Miami, where the American came back from losing the opening set. ""It's always tough against her,"" said Sharapova, who will reclaim the top ranking if she can win her 50th career WTA final. ""I haven't had a win against her in a long time, but the great thing is I'm setting myself up in a position where I can try to change that around. ""I thought I did really well against her in Miami for the first set and a half -- obviously that's not enough, but the goal is to keep that level for the whole match this time. ""It's been a while since we played on a clay court, too, and every match is different -- a different tournament and a different environment. I'm looking forward to it."" Williams won last year's event when it was held on blue clay -- an unpopular experiment that was later banned by the tennis authorities -- but she has not played in a final on red dirt since 2002. ""I feel like this whole tournament I've only played clay-court players from my first round to now, and everyone was also smaller than me,"" the 31-year-old said after Saturday's 7-5 6-2 win over Italian seventh seed Sara Errani -- beaten by Sharapova in last season's French Open final. ""So I think tomorrow will be a really good match -- a different game, more power obviously, but still a lot of the consistency. So I'm looking forward to it."" World No. 1 Williams is seeking to become just the 10th player to win 50 WTA titles, in her 66th final. ""Obviously I love being No. 1 -- in my heart I feel I'm No. 1. But I also love to win tournaments. So I think if I just win as many tournaments as I can, I'll be No. 1. Hopefully."" In the men's tournament, Rafael Nadal cruised into Sunday's final with a 6-0 6-4 win over 113th-ranked compatriot Pablo Andujar. The Spaniard, who has now reached seven successive finals since his comeback from knee injury in February, will next face Swiss 15th seed Stanislas Wawrinka. Wawrinka, who beat Dimitrov in the third round, earned his place in the final with a 6-3 4-6 6-4 victory against world No. 6 Tomas Berdych in just under two hours. Nadal, who won the tournament in 2005 and 2010, is seeking a record-extending 23rd Masters-level title. He was also the runner-up in 2009 and 2011.","Maria Sharapova will play Serena Williams in Sunday's final of Madrid event .

"(CNN) -- The John F. Kennedy who was elected in 1960 was not going to change the world. His major charge against the Eisenhower administration was that it was not prosecuting the Cold War vigorously. He believed that its policy of Massive Retaliation in the event of any attack meant America would be incapable of a flexible response to a non-nuclear communist aggression in the Third World, where, he believed, the Cold War would be won or lost. He aimed to close any missile gap (actually non-existent) with the Soviets. He aimed to beat the Russians to the moon. He planned to calm business fears by appointing a Republican Secretary of the Treasury. He wanted to avoid coercive civil rights legislation or the use of federal troops to enforce segregation because he put his faith in white southern moderate leaders. The John F. Kennedy who was assassinated in 1963 had begun to change the world. Admittedly, the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion did not lessen the enthusiasm of either the president or his brother, Bobby, for covert action and counter-insurgency. The military advisers committed to Vietnam were part of a flexible response -- but so was the inspirational Peace Corps. But chastened by confronting the Russians over Berlin and missiles in Cuba, and reassured by the knowledge that the missile build-up had guaranteed a measure of Cold War stability, Kennedy moved to lessen Cold War tensions and the dangers of nuclear war. He started a backchannel correspondence with Khrushchev. He negotiated, in the face of military opposition, a Test Ban Treaty which aimed to eliminate nuclear tests in the atmosphere. He was the first American president in the Cold War to talk about the Soviet Union as an adversary with whom the United States should peacefully compete, rather than an enemy to be defeated militarily. Except in the Yom Kippur war in 1973 the world never again came close to a nuclear holocaust. Under JFK the first steps to dÃ©tente were taken. Kennedy was the first president to understand the Sino-Soviet split. At home, he proposed a tax cut, not as a result of a budget surplus, but despite a budget deficit, in order to stimulate the economy. As a result of the crisis created by violent resistance in the South to civil rights protest, the president was forced to do the two things he did not want to do. He sent in federal troops to force the admission of a black student to the University of Mississippi. After the Birmingham demonstrations and the defiance of Governor Wallace on the steps of the University of Alabama, he went on national television to promise strong civil rights legislation and acknowledged for the first time that civil rights was an inescapable moral issue. Kennedy's assassination and Johnson's masterly leadership guaranteed the eventual passage of the civil rights bill and the tax cut. It did not interrupt the progress towards dÃ©tente. But Kennedy's death did put an end to third-party efforts to normalize relations with Cuba. Kennedy might have gone on to re-orient policy towards China. Would he have avoided the Vietnam disaster? Kennedy's defenders argue passionately that, protected by a big re-election win in 1964, he would have withdrawn American troops from Vietnam. But his Vietnam policy in late 1963 in which he acquiesced in the overthrow of President Diem's government was already locked in a policy of sustaining a South Vietnam government that was ready to fight the communists. He had effectively narrowed the options available to his successor. There is little evidence that he would have sanctioned the ""loss"" of South Vietnam. Faced with the impossibility of finding a government that was both popular and willing to fight the Vietcong, how would Kennedy have avoided the commitment of ground troops in 1965? Advised by McGeorge Bundy and Robert McNamara, who guided Vietnam policy under both JFK and LBJ, would Kennedy have been prepared to scale down the American commitment and see the South Vietnam regime collapse? British Ambassador and friend of the Kennedys, David Ormsby-Gore, tried to console Jackie Kennedy by telling her that the late president, ""had great things to do and would have done them."" The jury may be out on that judgment. But the British reacted with the same grief as the Americans to a lifer cut short, to the cruel death of a young man whose vigor and youth contrasted so markedly with the contemporary political leaders of an older generation: De Gaulle, Adenauer and Macmillan. They established at Runnymede, the site of the signing of Magna Carta, a memorial funded by popular appeal and driven by cross-party consensus on an acre of land permanently ceded to the United States. David Ormsby-Gore, as Lord Harlech, was the first chair of the Kennedy Memorial Trust which also awarded scholarships to the ""best and the brightest"" of British students to do graduate work at Harvard and MIT. On Friday, as current chair of the Trust, I will be laying a wreath at the memorial. Why does JFK's memory still resonate? Perhaps it is because contemporary American politics is dysfunctional and anti-intellectual fundamentalism is so rampant in American public life. Kennedy was familiar enough with congressional gridlock and only too aware of the paranoid style of American politics on the extreme right. But he was the modern American president who was most comfortable in his own skin, who surrounded himself with intellectuals and delighted in their company, and who made government service an honorable calling after the ravages of McCarthyism. Kennedy may not have changed the world and his assassination may not have significantly altered America's future, but 50 years on it is not surprising that his memory still evokes a profound sense of loss.

"(CNN) -- For millennia, cultures throughout the world have observed the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, as a sacred event. In the Northern Hemisphere, the winter solstice occurs on December 21 or 22, when the sun appears at its southernmost point in the sky. Ancient peoples whose survival depended on a precise knowledge of seasonal cycles marked this first day of winter with elaborate ceremonies and celebrations. Spiritually, these celebrations symbolize the opportunity for renewal, a casting off of old habits and negative feelings and an embracing of hope amid darkness as the days once again begin to grow longer. Many of the ancient symbols and ceremonies of the solstice live on today. Here are five extraordinary places to experience something magical during winter's relentlessly long night: . Travel Snapshots: See the year's best . England: Cornwall and Stonehenge . Better known for pirates than the solstice, the town of Penzance on the southwest coast of England is reviving a delightful array of Cornish solstice events over a six-day celebration leading up to December 21. The Montol Festival is a fun mix of pagan customs and more recent Christmas traditions that were once common throughout Cornwall. Early in the week, join in caroling, take a mask-making workshop and attend a mummers play (traditional English folk drama) and storytelling night. On the solstice, referred to here as Montol Eve, get your dancing card ready for the Guise, a community dance in which people dress in masks and other ""topsy-turvy"" disguises based on a 19th-century tradition of the rich dressing in rags while poorer citizens effected a ""mock posh"" look, all of which might involve a bit of gender-bending. 9 sparkling North American Christmas markets . You can also don your finery for torch-lit processions. The merrymaking only continues when the revelers disperse to pubs around town. Another focal point of the celebration is the burning of the ""Mock,"" a piece of wood representing a yule log. Here, the tradition takes on a Cornish twist: drawing a stick figure on the log for good luck before tossing it into the fire. With some planning, it's also possible to incorporate a trip to Stonehenge, the UK's most famous site for solstice celebrations. On the solstice, visitors have the rare opportunity to enter the towering, mysterious stone circle for a sunrise ceremony run by local pagan and druid groups. Organizers expect a record number of visitors this year: English Heritage, which manages Stonehenge, just unveiled a brand new visitor center that features hundreds of archaeological artifacts from the site, many on public display for the first time. The trip from Penzance to Stonehenge takes less than four hours by car, making it entirely feasible to spend the night of December 20 in Salisbury, the nearest town to Stonehenge, and rise before dawn for the ceremony among the stones. (Bundle up -- it's been known to snow.) Hang around to tour the new visitor center before returning to Penzance for Montol Eve. Sweden: Santa Lucia, yule and aurora borealis . Sweden is rich with solstice traditions, and Swedes start the party a bit early: December 13 is Santa Lucia Day, also known as the festival of lights. It commemorates an early Christian martyr, Lucia, who is celebrated in Scandinavia as a bringer of light in this dark northern land. Traditionally, the young girl chosen to be Lucia leads a procession of singers wearing a long white gown and a wreath of candles on her head. Elements of the yule, Northern Europe's ancient winter solstice celebration, are also incorporated into modern festivities, including gathering around bonfires, feasting, drinking and telling stories. A great place to experience all of these traditions is at Skansen, an open-air, living history museum that represents life in Sweden before the Industrial Revolution and features characters dressed in period costumes. On December 21, an all-day event at Skansen called Fire and Ice features a concert with original solstice compositions, ice carving and fire performers. Not to be missed throughout the season is the Christmas Market, where you can buy local crafts, admire lavish holiday decorations in Skansen's historical buildings and sample traditional Swedish cuisine. Continue to marvel at this seasonal interplay of light and darkness by heading for the Arctic Circle to see aurora borealis, the northern lights, in the Swedish Lapland. The Aurora Sky Station in Abisko National Park is an ideal place to catch the show. Another is the tiny village of JukkasjÃ¤rvi, where you can stay at an ice hotel that provides local guides to help you spot the lights. Bundle up and take a dog sled or snow mobile tour, then hibernate in front of a roaring fire with a steaming cup of glÃ¶gg. Maya country: The apocalypse is so 2012 . According to some popular myths about Maya prophesy, the end of the Maya calendar last year, on December 21, was supposed to signal the end of the world. Tourists flocked to sacred sites, prompting indigenous groups to protest the exploitation and misinterpretation of traditional Maya beliefs. With that frenzy safely behind us, now is a great time to experience a solstice celebration that teaches visitors about today's Maya and their ancestors. In Belize, a dance group that started last year as part of local celebrations of the conclusion of the last Maya calendar's cycle will perform again this year on December 21 and 22 at the Maya Center Village. It's about a 2.5-hour drive from Belize City, and the setting is spectacular. Maya Center is in the lush Maya Mountains at the entrance of the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, home to the world's first jaguar preserve. The Oxlajuj Baktun dance group is not a show for tourists, but respectful visitors are welcome to attend. Its purpose is prayer, purification and guidance for younger generations of Maya to connect with ancestors to ensure the continuation of their traditions. To inquire about attending, write to mayamuseum@yahoo.com. Visit the National Institute of Culture and History for further background and the Maya Center Mayan Museum Facebook page for updates. In Mexico, consider visiting Chichen Itza, the spectacular ancient city of temples, columns and pyramids that was once a great center of science and astronomy. The Temple of Kukulkan, with its 365 steps (one for every day of the year), is just one stunning example of the impressive engineering and astronomical feats of the Maya. No wonder this is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Chichen Itza is a 2.5-hour drive from Cancun. If you're planning to take a guided tour, choose tour operators who work with local Maya communities and use expert guides. Private tours are another option: Although pricier, they can offer a more comprehensive experience and are often led by experts. Sacred Earth Journeys is one company that offers private tours to the site led by a former director of Chichen Itza. India: Makar Sankranti and kite festivals . Unlike people in other places in the Northern Hemisphere that mark the solstice in December, Hindus in India celebrate Makar Sankranti, one of the most important festivals of the year, on January 14. Fundamentally, it is a celebration of the sun's journey toward the Northern Hemisphere, bringing longer days and the end of winter, which will make possible a good harvest. But Makar Sankranti is associated with many other themes, including strong family relationships and a renewed opportunity to rid oneself of negativity and embrace a better way of living. Different regions have different names for the festival and celebrate in a diversity of ways, usually involving bonfire pyres, feasting, singing and prayer. It's a day when pilgrims make their way to the holy river Ganges for a spiritual cleansing. The island of Gangasagar is one particularly special place for the faithful, who arrive from all over India to bathe in the Ganges where it meets the Bay of Bengal. Another popular event associated with Makar Sankranti are kite festivals, now held in cities across India. Jaipur, Mumbai and Ahmedabad host some of the most well-known kite festivals. Kite makers sell their wares in public markets in the days leading up to the festival, and soon the sky is filled with colorful, elaborate kites flown from balconies, stadiums, parks and beaches. Vancouver, British Columbia: Lantern festival . Vancouver's Winter Solstice Lantern Festival is a sparkling celebration of solstice traditions from around the world. The Secret Lantern Society assembles a wide array of music, dance, food and spectacular lantern-lit processions through many of the Canadian city's best-known neighborhoods. Staging areas for the main events include Granville Island and the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden. The Roundhouse Community Arts and Recreation Centre will feature African, gypsy and First Nations dance performances, and music that ranges from traditional solstice songs to jazz. Here's one of the best parts: Before the solstice, neighborhoods throughout Vancouver host lantern-making workshops. For $10 to $25, you can construct and decorate your own lantern to participate in one of several processions through the city on December 21 that lead to the indoor venues for music, dance and art-making. Don't miss the Labyrinths of Light with more than 700 lanterns laid out in circular patterns. Visitors can participate in a ""self-guided ceremony"" emphasizing the release of old attachments and opening oneself to new opportunities. After your spiritual cleansing, top it all off by participating in an all-night, all-ages dance party.","Cultures around the world celebrate the winter solstice .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Syria needs lots of things right now. One of them is George Clooney. Let me explain. As the Geneva II talks this week made clear, there is no end in sight for the bloody three-year war in Syria. In the meantime, more than 100,000 people have been killed, the country is destroyed, and millions of Syrians have fled their homes, half of them children. This is the defining war and humanitarian crisis of this decade, which was underscored by my visit to Syrian refugees here this week. And yet there is no outcry from the broader rich-country public to end the suffering there. To the extent that the media cover Syria, it is a diplomatic and political story. My media contacts say they need a ""fresh angle"" on the humanitarian aspect of Syria in order to get it covered. My friends on Capitol Hill say they're hearing nothing about Syria from their constituents, after a surge of opposition to the idea of punitive airstrikes this summer. My fellow fundraisers share my frustration that we can't get much traction with donors around Syria. Contrast that to a major natural disaster like the recent typhoon in the Philippines. When a catastrophic, photogenic act of God kills thousands of people and makes millions more homeless in an instant, news crews get mobilized, benefit concerts get arranged, the public gets generous, and the needs on the ground get met. But what if the killer is a complex, drawn-out, difficult-to-cover war with no clear good guys and bad guys, as it is in Syria? Well, those people need George Clooney. Here's one example of why: Mercy Corps, the global humanitarian organization I work for, raised more charitable dollars for the Philippines in three days -- about $1.5 million -- than we have raised for Syria in almost three years. Tragic as the typhoon was, the Philippines is on a road to rehabilitation. Syria, on the other hand, is slowly bleeding to death. 'Courage and magnetism' We need a telethon. We need vigils. We need letters to members of Congress. Of course that kind of activism alone isn't going to end the war and get Syrians everything they need, but it is a great place to start. That's where someone like George Clooney comes in. Clooney is a rare public figure with the credibility, courage, and magnetism to take an urgent, complicated issue and make it matter to Americans. To be clear, I am suggesting that Syria needs George Clooney more figuratively than literally. The authentic involvement of cultural icons helps form a movement, and that makes Syria more than some distant quagmire. Some shared sense of urgency and ownership is critical to breaking the horrific stasis of the situation in and around Syria, a situation that is perpetuated in part by the rich-world public generally sitting Syria out. Sometimes when I have this conversation with someone, they'll ask why people should get engaged on issues overseas when there are so many problems at home in the United States. It's an important point, but keep in mind that of all the charitable donations Americans made in 2012, only 6% went to international causes. Aid workers are often dismissive of entertainers who get involved in their causes, and there are plenty of cases of unhelpful dabbling. But look at George Clooney and Don Cheadle on Darfur. Angelina Jolie on refugees. Ben Affleck on Congo. Bono on just about everything. These celebrities, when working in partnership with policymakers, companies, philanthropists, and aid groups on the ground, can become the hugely powerful advocates that desperate people need. Like the people I met this week at the Ouzaii Collective Center in southern Lebanon. These 153 families fled Syria with little and are living packed together in an unfinished office building. Cinder blocks. Exposed rebar. Dodgy wiring. Limited water and sanitation. No glass in the windows. No school, no privacy, and no end in sight. They are totally dependent on the generosity of others, and yet neither charitable nor government funds are sufficient to meet their needs right now. Right now, the people of Syria need powerful friends to speak up, and George Clooney - so often the hero, on-screen and off - could call together the voices of support that these people so deserve. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeremy Barnicle.","There is no-end in sight for Syria's bloody war, writes Mercy Corps' Jeremy Barnicle .

"(CNN) -- The man raced toward the school gate, flailing a knife as terrified youngsters scattered. A little girl raises her arm to try to defend herself but fails. She falls to the ground, losing her pink backpack near the entrance gate. After a few minutes of horror, the attacker chases other students as they try to flee the school grounds. By the end of the man's rampage, at least 23 elementary students were wounded, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The knife attack at Chenpeng Village Primary School in China's Henan province took place on December 14, the same day an American gunman killed 20 student and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

Recently released surveillance video from the front of the Chenpeng school shows children and adults tried to fend off the attacker with brooms. Authorities say 36-year-old Min Yongjun first stabbed an elderly woman in Chenpeng before breaking into the elementary school, Xinhua said. Police said Min was driven to commit the attack by ""doomsday"" rumors, according to Xinhua. Authorities also said Min testified he was inspired by TV reports about a kindergarten killing in 2010. ""He thought he was doomed and hoped to do something to impress his existence upon the world before he died,"" police said, according to Xinhua. Initial assessments suggest the attacker is mentally ill, the state-run Chinanews.com said, citing Guangshan county authorities. China suffered a spate of knife and cleaver attacks targeting school children in 2010. A number of measures were introduced at the time, including increased security at schools across the country and a regulation requiring people to register with their national ID cards when buying large knives. But in Chenpeng, the only visible line of defense appeared to be elementary students and nearby adults with brooms.","The video shows children and adults trying to fend off the attacker with brooms .

""The circumstances were horrendous, and it highlights the incompetence of the school,"" said Perecman, who has also filed a legal claim of the family's intention to sue the city, school officials and the police. The teen's family, meanwhile, will hold a private funeral Saturday at Greenwich Village Funeral Home in Manhattan. There will be a Mass and lunch to celebrate Avonte's life, according to Penni Horwich, who is assisting in the funeral arrangements. ""We plan to stand outside and release around 300 white balloons,"" Horwich said. ""I thought it would be really nice."" In an October notice of intention to file a lawsuit, Fontaine accuses city and education department officials as well as the Riverview School, which her late son attended, with failing to adequately and properly supervise the boy. The notice of claim also alleges that officials failed to take appropriate and timely action to prevent him from the leaving the school, and did not immediately notify the police department. Additionally, Fontaine accuses the police department of failing to provide proper and appropriate security to the boy's school, of failing to design and implement a security system, and of being grossly negligent for the safety and well being of her son. A notice of claim is a precursor to a lawsuit, which Perecman said will be filed within the next couple of months. The claim seeks $25 million for serious and permanent emotional harm, psychological injuries, loss of earnings, and incurred expenses. ""This involves a terrible tragedy, and the City's thoughts are with Avonte's family. We will review the legal case thoroughly once it's received,"" the City Law Department said in a statement. Avonte, who had the mental capacity of a 7- or 8-year-old, according to his mother, went missing from his school on October 4. Surveillance footage showed him walking out of the school. Last week, police said a human arm, legs, underwear, dark jeans and a size 5Â½ Air Jordan sneakers washed up on the Queens side of the East River, police said. On Tuesday, DNA tests confirmed that the remains were those of Avonte, according to the medical examiner's office.","Avonte Oquendo went missing from his school on October 4 .

"(CNN) -- An anonymous video that appears to show several police officers torturing young male suspects in Argentina has outraged many people in the South American country. The video prompted a swift reaction from Argentine authorities. Eduardo Sylvester, security minister in Salta province, asked a judge to issue arrest warrants against the police officers accused of being involved in the incident, according to Telam, Argentina's state news agency. Five officers were arrested Thursday night, the agency said. On Friday, a sixth officer was arrested, said a police official who asked not to be identified because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media. The video, posted on YouTube, shows two young men wearing only their underwear. They are surrounded by several men in civilian clothes who are apparently the police officers implicated in the case. The suspects are being held in a patio. A high concrete wall is seen in the background. The men in civilian clothes are shown pouring water on the suspects. At one point, an interrogator asks a question. The suspect in the foreground replies in a fearful voice, ""I swear to you that I don't know anything about it."" He repeats the sentence several times. His interrogator then covers his head with a plastic bag, ties it around his neck and grabs the suspect by the head. The suspect starts yelling, then shaking and finally drops to the floor. The interrogator takes the bag off his head and the suspect is seen on the floor gasping for air. Another suspect is shown kneeling on the floor with his hands tied behind his back and being held up by one of the interrogators while another pours water on his head. The police source said officials believe the video was shot by one of the arrested officers. Officials don't know who posted the video to YouTube he said. Sylvester told CNN affiliate Canal 13 that officials acted quickly because, ""We, the government of Salta province, are strongly convinced that these police officers are not representative of who we truly are and we are not going to tolerate under any circumstances that officers commit this kind of crime."" The video was shot in the town of General Guemes in the northwestern Argentine province of Salta. It was filmed between September and November 2011, the police source said. The two suspects had been detained for misdemeanors and were freed soon after the incident, the source said. They are expected to testify against the officers, he added. Maria del Carmen Verdu, the director of an organization that monitors police brutality, known by its Spanish acronym CORREPI, said such incidents are common throughout Argentina. ""Torture is a common tool which is applied constantly in many detention centers and even to suspects held at police station cells before their court appearance,"" Verdu said. ""We have been able to prove it multiple times in court through oral testimonies of the victims."" The police source said, ""I don't agree that it's a common occurrence, but I can't deny that this happens either."" Argentines are especially sensitive to police and military brutality. It is estimated as many as 30,000 people were killed or disappeared during the country's military dictatorship, the period known as the Dirty War, which lasted from 1976 until 1983. Guillermo Fontana in Buenos Aires contributed to this report.","Six officers are arrested after video appears on YouTube .

"(CNN) -- With the world's eyes on her after a media frenzy over her former partner's alleged affair, France's former first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, said Monday she was doing fine and told people not to worry about her. The former partner of French President Francois Hollande made her first public appearance two days after bidding farewell to the Elysee presidential palace, following global headlines about Hollande's alleged affair with an actress. Smiling and dressed in a salmon pink top, Trierweiler addressed reporters during a trip to Mumbai, India, where she is lending her support to an anti-hunger charity. ""I feel good, I feel very happy to be here,"" she told a news conference intended to highlight the work of the Action Against Hunger charity in India. ""Do not worry about me."" Trierweiler left Paris discreetly on Sunday. On arrival in Mumbai she was greeted by a media scrum, which followed her as she visited a hospital and met patients in a campaign against child malnutrition. The trip had been planned months ago. During the news conference, Trierweiler described the emotion she felt holding a young child. ""I will continue to fight against (child malnutrition). This trip has been in the works for months. I would not have missed this engagement for anything,"" she said. Goodbye message . Hollande meanwhile traveled to Turkey on Monday for a state visit. The trip is his first public appearance since declaring on Saturday that his relationship with Trierweiler was over. ""I wish to make it known that I have ended my shared life (partnership) with Valerie Trierweiler,"" Hollande told the Agence France-Presse news agency. Trierweiler sent a goodbye message Saturday via Twitter to the staff at the presidential palace. ""All my gratitude goes to the extraordinary people at the Elysee. I will never forget the devotion or emotion at the time of leaving,"" she wrote. Hollande's private life has been the subject of global headlines since the French magazine Closer claimed this month he'd been having an affair with actress Julie Gayet for two years. French president says it's over . U.S. trip planned for February . Hollande has not confirmed or denied the alleged affair but did threaten legal action. At his first news conference of the year, Hollande said he and Trierweiler were going through ""painful moments."" The allegations had left Trierweiler's position in some doubt ahead of a planned trip to Washington in February. She had been Hollande's partner for several years. An arts columnist for weekly magazine Paris Match, she was not married to Hollande but assumed the role of first lady at official functions following his election in May 2012. Last week,Trierweiler left the hospital where she had spent a week being treated for stress and fatigue, Paris Match reported. The magazine also said she would recover for ""several days"" in an official residence in Versailles. Hollande, 59, has seen his personal approval ratings plummet since his election, although this has been attributed to dissatisfaction with his leadership rather than disapproval of his private life. A recent survey by French pollster Ifop with the weekly Le Journal du Dimanche found that more than 80% of respondents had not changed their opinion of the President based on the allegations of an affair. Hollande has four children from a previous relationship with Segolene Royal, a senior member of his Socialist Party and a 2007 presidential candidate. Royal announced their separation just after she lost the 2007 election to Nicolas Sarkozy.","Former first lady is in India to lend support to anti-hunger charity .

"(CNN) -- While there's plenty to be said in favor of the new, sometimes the best things stem from a solid original foundation. Industrial structures like warehouses and factories are finding new incarnations as luxury hotels, challenging designers to get creative with old bones and drawing in guests who seek a sense of history and character. In New York, the Wythe Hotel (Brooklyn) and the Refinery Hotel (Manhattan) were resurrected from a cooperage and a hat factory respectively. In Istanbul, the brand-new Shangri-La Bosphorus brings opulence to the banks of the river in the form of elegant rooms converted from a former tobacco warehouse. And the remote Fabriken Furillen, once a limestone refinery, is an isolated 16-room property on a Swedish island, where neighbors are few but the scenery is stunning. Here are seven cutting-edge hotels that come from humble origins. Your most spectacular travel photos . 1888 Hotel, Sydney . One of Sydney's trendiest accommodations, 1888 Hotel opened its doors in July, welcoming guests to its 90-room boutique property in the Pyrmont neighborhood. The guest rooms feature 10-foot ceilings; windows and desks constructed from recycled timber; and a lobby, an atrium and a bar studded with reclaimed wooden beams and exposed brick. Despite the vintage details, the five-story hotel takes a modern approach to technology: Each room comes with an iPad and Instagram users with more than 10,000 followers are entitled to one complimentary night's stay. The staff wears denim work shirts in a cheeky nod to the heritage-listed building's previous life as a woolshed. Rooms start at $150; 139 Murray St.; 61-2/8586-1888; 8hotels.com. Fabriken Furillen, Gotland, Sweden . While most former industrial buildings are found in ports or in cities, Fabriken Furillen is a rural outlier on the island of Gotland, off Sweden's southeastern coast. Once a limestone refinery, the 18-room hotel (including two cabins) is a haven of sharp-edged Scandinavian design in a stunningly scenic -- almost lunar -- setting. Rooms are painted in white or gray and feature luxury beds, Bang & Olufsen technology (some rooms have televisions, others have radios; the cabins are electronics-free) and bucolic touches like sheepskin rugs and blankets made from Gotland wool. The restaurant serves simple, elegant meals made with island-grown vegetables and herbs. Rooms start at $315; Rute Furillen, 624 58 LÃ¤rbro; 46-498/223-040; furillen.com. Top U.S. spots to visit in 2014 . Wythe Hotel, Brooklyn, New York . Brooklyn is home to plenty of reclaimed industrial spaces, but the Wythe Hotel is one of the newest (it opened in May 2012) and chicest. Floor-to-ceiling windows in many rooms look straight out onto the Manhattan skyline over the East River, letting in copious amounts of sunlight to play off the exposed-brick walls and custom-made wallpaper. Original cast-iron columns, masonry and 13-foot-high timber ceilings speak to the building's history as a cooperage. The concrete floors are heated (a detail the former tenants might have appreciated as they rolled out barrels on the Williamsburg waterfront); the furniture (beds were constructed from pine taken from the ceilings) and artwork is made locally. Rooms start at $180; 80 Wythe Ave.; 718-460-8000; wythehotel.com. Refinery Hotel, New York . A century-old neo-Gothic building in the heart of New York's Garment District, the Refinery started out as a millinery factory. It is now an elegant, eclectic 12-story hotel with amazing structural features and plenty of luxurious amenities. Opened in May 2013, it features lobby details (a 72-foot custom-designed runner, vaulted ceilings, plaid-patterened finished-walnut walls) that evoke an old New York feel. In the rooms, steel-and-leather headboards reinforce the industrial ambiance, while wooden bedside lockers add a touch of nostalgia. On occasion the hotel's loading dock becomes Hatbox, a gallery space hosting art exhibits and fashion shows. Rooms start at $460; 63 W. 38th St.; 646-664-0310; refineryhotelnewyork.com. Departures: World's best design hotels . Sir Albert, Amsterdam . Though Sir Albert may have a fictional host at its helm (the gentleman of its name is a made-up character), the hotel has a very real former life as a 19th-century diamond factory. Despite the space's original connection to gems, the decor has a distinctly masculine feel, thanks to brown curtains, dark wood furniture in the guest rooms and cowskin-patterned cubes for sitting in the study -- a cozy public space with deep leather armchairs and well-stocked bookshelves. Plenty of bright northern sunshine streams in through the high windows in most rooms, which harkens back to the legacy of the diamond workers, who needed the best possible light to practice their craft. Rooms start at $270; Albert Cuypstraat 2-6; 31-20/305-3020; siralberthotel.com. Departures: High-design airport terminals . Waterhouse, Shanghai . Formerly a dockyard warehouse on the Huangpu River, Waterhouse is now a high-design hotel. While plenty of its earliest features have been preserved -- the window frames are original metal and the wall behind the reception desk looks positively ancient -- the refurbished concept (by the lavishly praised Neri & Hu Design and Research Office) is a modern masterpiece. Playing with conventions of internal and external spaces, the design allows guests to peek into private quarters from public areas and vice versa. Gloriously sleek and minimalist, the 19 rooms contrast nicely with views onto the neon-lit Bund, which is crammed with unconventionally shaped skyscrapers. Rooms start at $195; Maojiayuan Road 1-3, Huangpu District; 86-21/6080-2988; waterhouseshanghai.com. Departures: Spectacular casino hotels . Shangri-La Bosphorus, Istanbul . Originally a tobacco warehouse in the 1930s, this Shangri-La property opened in May 2013 with the largest guestrooms in Istanbul. Situated on the European side of the city, with many rooms overlooking the Bosphorus Strait, the hotel pays homage to the opulence of its Bosphorus neighbor, DolmabahÃ§e Palace. Chandeliers glitter, specially commissioned artwork dazzles, and Turkish-marble bathrooms come stocked with Bulgari bath products. The hotel's architects even restored the Neoclassical faÃ§ade of the original warehouse. For unparalleled views, check out the Shangri-La Suite, which has three private terraces and overlooks the Old City (the Asian bank of the strait) and the Bosphorus Bridge. Rooms start at $740; Sinanpasa Mah, Hayrettin Iskelesi Sok, No.1, Besiktas; 90-212/275-8888; shangri-la.com. See more industrial-chic hotels . © 2010 American Express Publishing Corporation.

"(CNN) -- Before the interview for Talk Asia, all I knew about Julio Iglesias was that he sings love songs -- and that the ladies seem to love him. What I didn't know, was this is a man who was born to be famous and not even a life-threatening injury from a car accident would stop him. His story is one made for the silver screen. It has all the elements that tug at your heart strings: family drama, near-death experience, triumph over adversity, ultimate success, and a plot that just keeps on going. Iglesias' renowned voice has made him a superstar worldwide but his first foray into the spotlight wasn't through his voice, it was his feet. The football pitch was where he got his first taste of what it feels like to be adored by the crowds. Real deal . From a young age, Iglesias showed his fancy footwork in Real Madrid's junior league. Rising through the ranks, he would eventually become goalkeeper for Real's reserve team. Iglesias humbly admits he was never a real football talent but he had the discipline which would see him play with the biggest names of that generation. While his dream to play for the Primera Division would never be realized, just being in close proximity to the players and playing in the same stadium was enough to feel the call of something big. ""You feel 50,000 people in the stadium and you go on the grass and the magic starts. You feel like are something else. All the dreams that you have for years come back in a reality and you are in front of so many people playing a match and you win, you lose. It's passion, it's courage,"" he said. Accident . Perhaps it's that courage that saw him through one of the most challenging times of his life. When he was 19, a drive home after a party with two friends ended in tragedy. While taking a curve in the road, the car he was driving crashed, leaving him clinging on to life. What would come would crush his dreams of ever playing football again. The crash compressed a nerve in his spine leaving him paralyzed from the chest down; a paralysis that would see him bed-ridden for two years. ""All I felt at that time was 'Why? Why has this happened to me?' ""I'm someone who believes there's a reason for everything. Sometimes that belief is challenged but more often than not, I believe events take place that force you to think, feel, and act in ways you may never have before. I believe people come into your life for a reason."" For Iglesias, that belief was crystallized in that devastating moment, and those challenging two years changed his life. What he did not realize at the time was that it would all change for the better. Musical discovery . A nurse who was treating him brought Julio a guitar. The gesture was two-fold: a distraction from the depression of what kind of a life would lie ahead, and a means to exercise the dexterity and strength in his fingers and hands. He discovered a passion for music that he didn't know he had. And perhaps more than anything, a renewed purpose in life. ""I started to move my toes. I started to get up, I started to walk albeit painfully, and I started to realize that I could survive ... I started to think that I could be alive again ... So from that day I took chances. I disciplined my life. Without discipline I would not be here. I would not be talking to you, I would not be a singer, and I would be nothing. Discipline woke up my life again."" The rest as they say is history. Devoted following . Eighty albums released in 14 languages, over 300 million records sold worldwide, and a devoted following of women who hear that something in his voice that knows no boundaries of language. Despite claiming to be ""not that great"" of a singer, Iglesias' ability to connect to a global audience has served him well. He says it's his passion for music and for people. Perhaps, though, what they see is his vulnerability, a quality he himself says ""is the most attractive thing that an artist can have."" ""Since that time I understood that music, and the passion for music, was my life ... I was not a good singer, I didn't even know how to write a song ... but I realized what an incredible opportunity I had. The life came back to my eyes and I became a singer.""","Heart throb Julio Iglesias tells how his life was changed be a car crash .

"(CNN) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed legislation that requires the state to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states while such marriages were legal in California. California will recognize same-sex marriages from a period of time before Proposition 8 was enacted. Same-sex marriages performed elsewhere between June 16, 2008, and November 5, 2008, are to be legally recognized, as are in-state marriages performed during that time. The end date represents when a ballot initiative, Proposition 8, added a ban on same-sex marriage to the state constitution. Proposition 8 bars the state from recognizing any marriage performed outside the state outside those dates. The state Supreme Court ruled after the proposition passed that marriages performed before the ban would remain on the books. But Senate Bill 54 splits a legal hair and requires the state to recognize such marriages as ""unions,"" providing ""the same legal protections that would otherwise be available to couples that enter into civil unions or domestic partnerships out-of-state,"" the governor said. ""In short, this measure honors the will of the people in enacting Proposition 8 while providing important protections to those unions legally entered into in other states,"" Schwarzenegger said in a signing statement accompanying his signature. He signed the bill Sunday. Proponents of Proposition 8 lambasted the governor. ""The governor's signing of SB 54 illustrates his disregard for the sovereign authority of California's voting citizens,"" said Everett Rice, a spokesman for the California Family Council. ""In 2000 and 2008, the voters expressed their desire at the ballot box to protect traditional marriage. They emphatically affirmed that marriage should retain its historical definition and identity. However, today the governor has joined with other elected representatives by choosing to place the demands of special interest groups over more than 7 million California voters.""","Bill requires California to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states .

"(Mashable) -- Despite recent troubles, Netflix is a major force on the Internet, accounting for 32.7% of peak U.S. downstream traffic, according to a new report. Sandvine Intelligent Broadband Networks' report analyzed 200 Internet service providers in 80 countries and found that real-time entertainment apps take up 60% of peak downstream traffic, up from 50% last year. Netflix has more than half of that share. Sandvine considers the hours between 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. to be peak times. Like others, Sandvine has also noticed a shift away from PCs to access such content. The company found 55% of traffic volume in North America is consumed on game consoles, set-top boxes, smart TVs and mobile devices. Only 45% is being accessed by laptops or PCs. Video makes up 32.6% of peak downstream mobile traffic, of which YouTube is the largest contributor. The report comes as Netflix recently lost 800,000 paid subscribers in its most-recent quarter. The company's stock is now trading at less than a third of the amount it was in July. See the original article on Mashable.com . © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Shanghai (CNN) -- So, they apparently did it again. For the second time in a decade, 15-year-olds in Shanghai have scored at the top of the PISA global education assessment, ranking number one in the world in reading, math and science. The Chinese city has a top performing system thanks in part to the strong drive and self-belief of its students, says OECD special advisor on education policy -- and PISA survey head -- Andreas Schleicher. ""In Shanghai, you have nine out of ten students telling you, 'It depends on me. If I invest the effort, my teachers are going to help me to be successful,'"" Schleicher tells me during a taping of CNN's ""On China"" on location in the city. The Shanghai exam results have come under fire for shutting out the city's migrant children and not being representative of the city's total student population -- something the OECD refutes. But one thing is for certain. The results are not representative of a nation. China as a whole does not take the PISA exam. Data on a number of Chinese cities and provinces is not yet published by PISA. China as a whole is expected to be included in the 2015 assessment. Data from the Rural Education Action Program (REAP) at Stanford University in the United States provides a stark picture of how Shanghai's education success is not repeated in China's less wealthy, rural interior. While 84% of high school grads in Shanghai go to college, less than 5% of China's rural poor make it to university. High school attendance is just 40% in poor, rural areas of China. And as they struggle with poverty and debate the opportunity cost of simply going to class, a significant number of rural students start dropping out in middle school. Why are students dropping out? Across the world's second biggest economy, the education system is vastly unequal. But incredibly, Schleicher tells me a child from a poor background in China has a better chance to be well educated than poor, rural students in other countries. ""The learning environment you would encounter there, the quality is a lot higher than what you'd encounter in a similar context almost anywhere else in the world,"" he says. Seated across from Schleicher during the ""On China"" panel discussion in Shanghai is Andrea Pasinetti, the founder of Teach for China -- a non-profit that brings graduates from China and the U.S. to teach at some of China's most under-resourced schools. Pasinetti reveals a particularly bullish view on rural education in China: ""A lot of these (rural) schools tend to be boarding schools. So the school provides not only a context for classroom instruction, it also provides a context for personal growth and exploration."" Pasinetti's views are distinctly out of sync with that of educator Jiang Xueqin, currently the Deputy Principal of Tsinghua University High School. ""Kids in the rural regions are at a huge disadvantage. Teachers and school are under-resourced,"" he says. ""The other issue is that in the rural regions, there's a lot of movement so parents move to the cities leaving their kids behind in the schools. So there isn't that parental support and guidance that kids need to thrive. ""Rural schools are under a lot of cultural stigma. No one in China believes they will succeed."" Though Jiang's assessment is in line with what has generally been reported about China's rural education challenges, Pasinetti calls it an ""irresponsible perception."" ""It is a huge misconception that local communities aren't invested in the education of their children and grandchildren,"" says the Teach for China founder. ""I speak to grandmothers who are illiterate, who live often on two or three dollars a day... who would do anything and stop at nothing to make sure that the child they have in their home is able to achieve a great education. ""The big difficulty is that oftentimes, they don't know where to start."" The Chinese government is attempting to tackle the challenge. In 2010, China released a 10-year national education reform plan. Among other objectives, it plans to focus less on tests and get the best teachers into the rural communities that desperately need them. ""Every discussion you have with Chinese officials about education reform revolves around the question of equity,"" says Pasinetti. But Jiang is not optimistic about the prospects for education equity in China. ""Over the years it will become worse and worse,"" he says. ""The rich and powerful are choosing to detach themselves from the traditional school system."" Jiang sees a China where the wealthy will move education resources to a system of new private schools that cater only to them. And that is the dark future China must avoid. ""If you don't change the school system now, you'll get people buying themselves out of it,"" says Schleicher. ""That's basically the challenge that China has.""","15 year olds in Shanghai rank number one in the world in reading, math and science .

"(CNN) -- When a new president strolls into the White House, there's a kick in his step and a twinkle in his eyes. This photo illustration projects what President-elect Barack Obama may look like in four years. But as the years go by, the high-stakes decisions, constant criticisms and the fluctuating public opinion chip away at the president. His shoulders slump a little and his energy may seem sapped. The president ages twice as fast while in office, according to a theory advanced by Dr. Michael Roizen, a chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic. ""The typical person who lives one year ages one year,"" he said.  ""The typical president ages two years for every year they are in office."" Using public information, Roizen looked through medical records of previous presidents back to Theodore Roosevelt. Assessing factors such as diet, blood pressure, physical activity and lifestyle habits, he calculated that the leader of the free world ages more quickly. Roizen, who is the author of ""RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be?"" has not assessed the ""real age"" of President-elect Barack Obama, who is 47, because of lack of medical data. ""Barack Obama is a fairly young guy and doesn't have great of a risk,"" Roizen said.  ""If he's president for eight years, he ends up having the risk of disability or dying, like someone who is 16 years older."" Former president Bill Clinton entered the office with a robust head of salt-and-pepper hair and a healthy habit of running.  After bitter partisan battles, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and impeachment by the House, Clinton left office with wrinkles and powder-white hair. ""Chronic stress can produce lots of wear and tear on the body,"" said James A. McCubbin, a Clemson University professor of psychology and senior associate dean of the College of Business and Behavioral Science. ""This is what we see in the changes in the appearance in the beginning and end of the presidency."" Roizen points to the experience of Ronald Reagan. ""When Reagan came into office, he stood up absolutely straight. He was joking and incredibly quick-witted about current events. When he left office, he was hunched over. The age signs on face was there. His jokes were those of olden days rather than current events,"" he said.  See the toll of the presidency » . On Wednesday, Obama, President George W. Bush, and all three living former presidents -- Jimmy Carter, George Herbert Walker Bush, and Clinton -- are meeting in the Oval Office and then having lunch together at the White House. After eight draining years in the Oval Office, an outgoing president like George W. Bush can reverse the tolls of stress by exercising and spending time with friends, Roizen says. ""Do as many healthy things as you can adopt,"" Roizen suggested.  ""The main thing he should do is finding what he wants to do with the rest of his life, which is tough for presidents to find something meaningful to do."" During his second term, Bush dealt with a troubled war, a struggling economy, and sagging approval ratings.  But the avid runner, mountain biker and fisherman showed that his reflexes haven't slowed. ""I mean, did you see him dodge that shoe?"" said David Zinczenko, editor-in-chief of Men's Health magazine, referring to a December news conference in Iraq where an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at the president and Bush swiftly ducked the flying footwear. Twice. The incoming president is also no slacker. Although accused by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of having skinny legs, Obama regularly frequents the gym and plays basketball. The president-elect was on the cover of Men's Health in November. ""This is not a broccoli-shunning, pork rind-eating, McDonald's-popping guy. I mean, this is someone who eats arugula and guacamole and Hawaiian pizza,"" Zinczenko told CNN.   Watch a report on presidential aging » . ""If the worst that happens is that your hair goes a little gray, so be it."" Many recent presidents have turned to sports to decompress. Presidents have enjoyed mountain biking (George W. Bush), golf (Clinton, Gerald Ford, Dwight D. Eisenhower), tennis (Ford, Carter, George H.W. Bush), jogging (Clinton, Carter and both Bushes), swimming (Ford), bowling (Richard Nixon), horseshoes (George H.W. Bush) and horseback riding (Reagan). Check out projected aging of other political leaders . ""The daily routine of a president is really grueling,"" Ron Nessen, Ford's press secretary, told CNN. ""It's hard to get thinking time. Ford talked about how when he was swimming laps, it gave him time to think about things."" During the Democratic primaries, Obama worked out at the gym in the Cleveland Clinic the morning of his debate with then-rival Hilary Clinton. Living up to his nickname ""No Drama Obama,"" the candidate was remarkably calm, considering a high-stakes debate was to take place that night, Roizen recalled.

"(CNN) -- A libertarian from The Cato Institute and a progressive from Public Citizen may not often agree on politics or what the proper role of government should be, but we agree the public has been kept in the dark on the ""too big to jail"" issue for too long. Just over a year ago, many were stunned when the Department of Justice decided not to indict HSBC, headquartered in London an one of the world's largest banks. The Justice Department made this decision despite the fact that the bank willfully failed to comply with anti-money laundering laws. HSBC's criminal activities seemed to most observers to provide a strong case for the government. These activities included permitting narcotics traffickers to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of drug proceeds through HBSC subsidiaries. It also facilitated hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions on behalf of customers in countries that are sanctioned by the United States: Cuba, Iran, Libya, Sudan and Myanmar (formerly known as Burma). But instead of charging HSBC, the Justice Department entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. Under its terms, the government agreed not to prosecute the company for its actions in exchange for HSBC acknowledging wrongdoing, paying a fine and agreeing to cooperate with the government and remedy its compliance programs. The back's CEO issued a statement accepting responsibility and saying: ""The HSBC of today is a fundamentally different organisation from the one that made those mistakes."" One can question the wisdom of our drug war and whether banks should be drafted into law enforcement duties, but those policy questions do not change a bank's duty to comply with the law. In a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing after the settlement, U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, asked Attorney General Eric Holder why the government chose not to indict HSBC. Holder responded by saying he was not talking about HSBC in particular but that, ""I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy."" From Holder's statements, it appears that the government was so worried about the dangerous repercussions that could result from prosecuting such a large, complex and globally significant institution that it shielded HSBC from criminal liability. In a subsequent House Financial Services Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing that examined the ""too big to jail"" problem, members of Congress asked repeatedly how the Justice Department decides which financial institutions are ""too big to jail"" and what information it relies upon to make those decisions. The witness, Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman, was evasive, and left Congress and the public without answers. Now, over a year after the HSBC settlement, those questions still loom. Justice has yet to explain its policy and practice concerning the prosecution -- or refusal to prosecute -- large, complex financial institutions. Without clear answers about how the Justice Department decides which financial institutions are ""too big to jail"" and what information it relies upon to make those decisions, we are left to wonder about the extent to which the department might be undermining its mission to enforce the law and ensure fair and impartial administration of justice. If it bases enforcement actions on a bank's size and economic significance, the Justice Department would be taking on the role of financial regulator. While we may not agree on the wisdom of allowing bank regulators to designate certain entities as ""systemic,"" congressional intent is clear that such a decision is the purview not of Justice but of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. We have yet to see any evidence that the department conferred with the Oversight Council or any financial regulator in determining whether HSBC, or any other institution, was indeed ""systemic."" Were the Justice Department to maintain a policy of basing enforcement decisions upon an entity's perceived impact on the national economy, one result would be to further entrench ""too big to fail."" Such an arrangement would allow these favored companies to borrow at subsidized rates and to capture market-share from smaller competitors, ultimately making these same ""too-big-to-fail"" companies even bigger. ""Equality under the law"" demands that companies are treated similarly under the law, regardless of their size. There cannot be a separate justice system for the large and another system for the small. If certain institutions are being provided preferential treatment under the law, then the Justice Department should publicly acknowledge that that is the case, as well as its reasoning for doing so. After passing the one-year mark, we hope that our policymakers reflect on this unresolved issue and respond appropriately. The public deserves no less. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Authors: Federal prosecutors declined to indict HSBC for wrongdoing a year ago .

"London (CNN) -- The British Prime Minister's former media chief listened to a hacked voice mail message left by actress Sienna Miller for actor Daniel Craig, when he was editor of the now defunct News of the World tabloid, a former reporter told a London court. Andy Coulson, editor of the Rupert Murdoch mass-selling tabloid paper until 2007 and then Prime Minister David Cameron's head of communications until 2011, heard the voice mail left for the James Bond actor, Dan Evans, a former News of the World journalist told London's Old Bailey Court on Tuesday. The revelation came at the trial of former News of the World editors Coulson and Rebekah Brooks and the paper's former managing editor, Stuart Kuttner. All are accused of conspiring between October 2000 and August 2006 ""to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority."" They deny the charges. Voice mail message . Dressed in a blue suit and red tie, Evans took the stand as a prosecution witness after pleading guilty to hacking phones. He described how he hacked Craig's voice mail and heard a female voice saying: ""Hi, it's me, I can't speak, I'm at the Groucho (club) with Jude. I love you."" Evans told the court he looked up the number and found that it was Miller's. He then said he played it for Coulson and several other senior figures at the paper. ""Later in the day, Andy came over, he wanted to hear the tape,"" Evans said. ""Andy told me to make a copy of the tape, put it in a jiffy bag; take it down the the front gate and say it's been dropped anonymously,"" Evans said. He added that another senior figure at the paper, upon hearing the message, told Evans: ""You're a company man now."" Phone hacking furor . When asked by the prosecution if he had ever had any other direct communication with Coulson concerning phone hacking, Evans said: ""Not that I can think of, no."" He then listed Coulson among figures at the newspaper who he said definitely knew he was hacking into phones. Evans also admitted to recreational drug use, and to being arrested. He said he was now clean. On Monday, Miller's former partner, actor Jude Law, attended the trial. The court also then heard that Evans had already admitted to conspiring to hack phones at the Sunday Mirror paper between February 2003 and January 2005, and the same offense at the News of the World up to 2010, according to Britain's Press Association news agency. He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office, it said. Coulson became Cameron's top communications adviser after leaving News of the World in an earlier round of the hacking scandal. He has denied knowledge of phone hacking. At the height of the phone hacking furor in July 2011, which resulted in the closure of the News of The World, Cameron said he would make a profound apology if it turned out that Coulson had lied about his knowledge of phone hacking. The hacking allegations prompted Cameron to set up an independent inquiry, led by Lord Justice Leveson, to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the media with the public, police and politicians.","Court hears former reporter describe hacking Daniel Craig's phone .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's public service broadcaster, the BBC, was caught up in a growing furor Saturday over claims that a late children's TV presenter sexually abused young women and girls, sometimes on its premises, in the 1960s and 1970s. The abuse claims, which come almost a year after presenter Jimmy Savile died, were made by five women in a documentary screened by rival broadcaster ITV Wednesday. Those interviewed for the film, titled ""Exposed -- the other side of Jimmy Saville,"" gave detailed accounts of sexual assault while as young as 14 or 15. One said she was raped by him at age 16. Interviewed on a BBC program Saturday, BBC Director of Editorial Policy David Jordan gave what appeared to be the strongest confirmation yet from the broadcaster of wrongdoing on its premises. ""I think the fundamentals of the story are now well established,"" he said. ""We now know that a number of women were appallingly sexually abused by Jimmy Savile, sometimes on BBC premises, at times during the 1960s and 1970s."" The police are now involved in the matter and the BBC says it is cooperating fully. London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement Friday that its officers had met with representatives from the BBC and a national child protection charity. ""We are now collating information gathered from a range of sources across the UK and will continue contacting individuals who have made allegations in relation to the late Jimmy Savile over the coming weekend,"" it said. ""We do not expect to have a clear picture of exactly how many women may have suffered abuse until next week and want to allow time for victims to reflect on what they may have experienced."" Savile, who hosted popular children's TV programs including ""Jim'll Fix It"" and ""Top of the Pops,"" was a household name in Britain for decades. He was also well known for his charitable work, having raised millions of pounds, and was awarded a knighthood. He died last October aged 84. A BBC statement released earlier this week said it was horrified by the claims that have emerged. ""A number of serious and disturbing allegations have been made over the past few days about the sexual abuse of teenage girls by Sir Jimmy Savile,"" it said. ""Some of these allegations relate to activity on BBC premises in the 1960s and 70s. We are horrified by allegations that anything of this sort could have happened at the BBC -- or have been carried out by anyone working for the BBC. ""They are allegations of a serious criminal nature which the police have the proper powers to investigate."" A nephew of Savile, Roger Foster, said he had ""every faith"" his uncle was innocent of the claims and would have defended himself ""vigorously"" had the allegations been made in his lifetime. ""It seems to me a terribly one-sided program. How can anybody defend themselves if they are not here to do that?"" Foster said in a recent interview with Britain's Telegraph newspaper. ""It just seems to be very, very sad that these comments have come out now. If there was any truth to them at all, why didn't they come out years ago when it actually happened?"" The controversy has prompted a wider examination of an apparent culture of sexism at the BBC in past decades that may have fed into abusive behavior. Liz Kershaw, a DJ who started working at BBC Radio 1 in 1987, just after Savile left the station, described the environment then as ""like walking into a rugby club locker room."" She told BBC Radio 4 on Saturday that his behavior was an ""open secret"" within the station, saying, ""round Radio 1 everybody joked about Jimmy Savile and young girls."" She was also routinely groped by another radio presenter while live on air, she said -- and her complaints about this were met by ridicule. Kershaw acknowledged that the broadcaster would treat such a complaint differently now, but said that at the time she was groped its response had been out of step with public views on acceptable behavior. The BBC has also come under pressure to explain why its own flagship Newsnight program, which looked into a previous police investigation into abuse claims against Savile last year, decided not to run the story. That police investigation was dropped for lack of evidence. The program's editor, Peter Rippon, said the decision was made solely for editorial reasons.","Claims of sexual abuse have been made against a late BBC children's TV presenter .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama faces a real dilemma as he prepares for the State of the Union. Most Americans believe our country is on the wrong track. A majority oppose Obamacare, for a variety of reasons. Five years into his presidency, there is still a very weak economy, and 74% of Americans believe it feels like we are still in a recession. In addition, he has had a terrible year in which his major policy initiative failed spectacularly and his administration was caught misusing the IRS against political opponents, many Americans were startled to discover the scope of electronic government surveillance and details continued to trickle out about a number of other scandals. And 53% recently indicated they believe the Obama administration is simply incompetent. The President is now so unpopular in some parts of America that incumbent Democrats hide when he comes to their state. The President recently tried moving to the left with rhetoric about income inequality to arouse his base. That strategy so alienated independents that the White House is now suggesting the State of the Union will focus on upward mobility and helping people achieve higher incomes through growth (core Republican themes) rather than on income inequality. The Obama dilemma is simple. He can move to the left and his base will be relatively happy (except on the NSA spying, where they may be the angriest opponents of the President's policies). But the base is too small to win the Senate races this fall. He can move to the center, and the base may be bored and stay at home while the independents remain alienated by the economy and Obamacare. Tuesday night, the President will be playing a weak hand. He will get a standing ovation a number of times, of course, and the State of the Union is always a spectacle centered on the president. Most speeches like this have an impact for three days. We will see if the President has found a formula that is more effective and lasting. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Newt Gingrich.","Newt Gingrich: President Obama facing tough headwinds as he gives State of the Union .

"(CNN) -- Spring is in the air, and now, on the ground. CNN talked to garden experts to get the scoop on this year's best destinations to view beautiful, budding flowers. Missouri Botanical Garden's Orchid Show When: Through March 27 Where: St. Louis Cost: $4 to $8 . For an unforgettable display of orchids, the Missouri Botanical Garden offers 7,500 individual orchid plants. This year's Mayan theme pays homage to the Long Count calendar, which some say predicts the world's end in 2012. Moss-covered mannequins wearing imposing headpieces made of dried botanicals, a serpent fountain and replicas of Mayan stone sculptures are mixed into the tropical display. ""You're going to see a pretty diverse landscape when you go to Missouri,"" Daniel J. Stark, executive director of the American Public Gardens Association, said of the Botanical Garden. ""They have wonderful and different kinds of gardens."" Chicago Botanic Garden When: Spring Where: Chicago Cost: Free . Lauded as having the most notable display gardens in the Midwest, the Chicago Botanic Garden features four natural areas and 24 display gardens, all on nine islands surrounded by lakes. ""They have unbelievable blooms in the spring,"" Stark said. The Graham Bulb Garden, for example, has narcissus, tulips, ornamental onions, fritillaries and lilies. A double-planting technique utilized in the garden makes it look like the bulbs are blooming longer. ""People travel from all over to see spring flowers at the Chicago Botanic Garden because of the quantity, quality and diversity of flowers,"" said Kris Jarantoski, the garden's executive vice president and director. Dallas Blooms When: March 5 to April 10 Where: Dallas Cost: $8 to $12 . For the ""greatest flower display"" in the Southwest, the Dallas Arboretum is home to more than 500,000 spring-blooming bulbs, said Justin Hancock, senior garden editor for Better Homes and Gardens. The arboretum's Dallas Blooms festival is now in its 27th year. Tulips, daffodils and hyacinths populate the 66-acre garden, and ""bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush offer a fun red and blue combo,"" Hancock said. Beginning at the same time, the Fairy Tale Castles exhibit will feature castles from ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""The Little Mermaid,"" to name a few -- all interspersed between the flowers. ""[Dallas Blooms] is a world-class tulip show,"" said Terry Lendecker, public relations manager for the Dallas Arboretum. ""In fact, it is the spot this side of Holland to see the most tulips in the world."" The New York Botanical Garden When: March 5 to April 25 Where: Bronx, New York Cost: $6 to $20 . The New York Botanical Garden's ""The Orchid Show: On Broadway"" utilizes a Tony award-winning set designer to bring the charm of the theater outdoors. The show stars 5,000 orchids. ""They're spectacular in the spring,"" Stark said. ""They're going to be focused on making sure everything is popping at the right time."" There will be more than 300 types of orchids on display, showcased with high drama in curtains, arcades and chandeliers. Philadelphia International Flower Show When: March 6 to March 13 Where: Philadelphia Cost: $15 to $30 . With more than 2,000 entries, Philadelphia's is the largest indoor flower show in the world. ""It's just amazing beyond belief,"" Hancock said. ""The theme this year is springtime in Paris, so you know it's going to have a very sophisticated feel."" The show has progressed from its humble beginnings in 1829 to what it is today: 10 acres of beautiful blooms and diverse designs. Some of the major exhibitor presentations will be put together by the American Orchid Society, the Pennsylvania Bonsai Society and Tourism Ireland, to name a few. ""The atmosphere inside the Pennsylvania Convention Center is a celebration of early spring,"" said Alan Jaffe, public relations manager for The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. ""It's not quite there on the calendar, but amid the spectacular displays and wonderful scents of fresh blooms, there is a sense of hope, renewal and excitement."" Santa Barbara International Orchid Show When: March 11 to March 13 Where: Santa Barbara, California Cost: $10 to $12 . Orchid enthusiasts won't want to miss Santa Barbara's displays, which include hundreds of different species from all over the world. Displays ""from the beautifully sublime to the exotically unusual"" attract visitors from as far away as Australia and India,"" said Heidi Kirkpatrick and Sandra Russell, publicists for the show. Now in its 66th year, the ""Get Your Kicks with Orchids"" theme celebrates Route 66 and the ""spirit of adventure and discovery,"" according to the website. Aside from the stunning orchid displays, the show also offers culture and potting demonstrations, flower and corsage arrangements, and an orchid-themed art show. Guests can also purchase orchids, supplies and paraphernalia from local, regional and international vendors. Canada Blooms When: March 15 to March 20 Where: Toronto, Ontario Cost: $14 to $75 . For those willing to make the trek north of the border, Canada Blooms is the biggest flower show in Canada and includes six acres of display gardens, Hancock said. There will be more than 250,000 plants, trees and flowers on exhibit. Started in 1996 by the Garden Club of Toronto and Landscape Ontario, Canada Blooms is now a spring destination for visitors across Canada and the United States. Canada Blooms will include five JUNO Rocks gardens, paying homage to Canada's music awards, now in their 40th year. Atlanta Blooms When: March 22 to May 1 Where: Atlanta Cost: $13 to $19 . The Atlanta Botanical Garden promises 100,000 new bulbs, spread out to span early, mid- and late blooms. The spring-blooming bulbs will include tulips, daffodils, hyacinth and crocus, among others. ""By March, people are starved for springtime,"" said Danny Flanders, a spokesman for the Atlanta Botanical Garden. ""After this particularly cold winter in the Southeast, we think visitors are going to be mesmerized by all the color."" The bulbs will join existing perennials, pansies, phlox, daphne, spring wildflowers, native azaleas and deciduous magnolias. Tulip Fest When: March 25 to May 1 Where: Woodburn, Oregon Cost: $5 to $20 . The 26th annual Tulip Fest will highlight tulip and daffodil fields and display gardens at the Wooden Shoe Tulip Farm, 45 minutes from Portland in Woodburn, Oregon. ""It features 40 acres of spring-blooming bulbs,"" Hancock said. ""That's more tulips than most people can even imagine in one place."" Guests can buy cut flowers or order bulbs for fall planting. ""There is nothing like wandering out in the middle of a tulip field in full bloom,"" said Barb Iverson, representative for Wooden Shoe Tulip Farm. ""On those warm days in the spring when we are in full bloom, the field literally glows."" National Cherry Blossom Festival When: March 26 to April 10 Where: Washington, D.C. Cost: Free for most events . Commemorating the gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Mayor Yukio Ozaki of Tokyo to Washington, D.C., the National Cherry Blossom Festival is a celebration of the ""lasting friendship between the United States and Japan and the continued close relationship between the two countries,"" according to the website. More than 1 million people visit each year to take in the blossoming cherry trees and attend events such as the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade and the Lantern Walks. The website estimates April 4 as the peak bloom date, though an accurate prediction won't be available until 10 days before peak bloom. The blooming period can be as long as 14 days. ""The particular arrangement of the cherry blossom trees around the Tidal Basin and monuments is truly spectacular,"" said Danielle Piacente, communications manager for the National Cherry Blossom Festival. ""When the cherry blossoms are in bloom, you know it's springtime."" Longwood Gardens When: April 2 to May 27 Where: Kennett Square, Pennsylvania Cost: $8 to $18 . Longwood Gardens is one of the best-known gardens in the United States for a good reason: There are 1,050 acres of gardens and meadows, covered in 11,000 types of plants and more fountains than any other garden in the country. ""They draw audiences from long distances to see their spring blooms,"" Stark said. Those blooms include azaleas, dogwoods, hyacinth, irises and tulips. The 20 outdoor gardens are teeming with lively flowers and beautiful fountains, and cover about one mile in distance. ""There is a renewed energy and vibrancy at Longwood in early spring,"" said Patricia Evans, a spokeswoman for Longwood Gardens. ""Our visitors delight in seeing spring blossom throughout the outdoor gardens and to see the Longwood's famed fountains once again jet to life."" Bluebonnet Festival When: April 9 and 10 Where: Chappell Hill, Texas Cost: Free . Though Texas is chock full of wildflowers and bluebonnet festivals, Chappell Hill's is the only ""Official Bluebonnet Festival of Texas,"" as declared by the Texas Legislature. ""Bluebonnets and other wildflowers are very, very plentiful in Washington County,"" said Ladonna Vest, administrative director of the Chappell Hill Historical Society. ""Visitors can 'come to the country' and have a wide variety of choices of sites to see."" With more than 250 exhibitors, country-style food and live entertainment, as well as fields filled with the iconic bluebonnets, it's easy to see why the festival was voted one of the most popular in Texas.","The Chicago Botanic Garden is said to have the best display gardens in the Midwest .

"(CNN) -- If the global economy remains sluggish, a small corner of the British horse racing hub of Newmarket is very much bucking the trend. It is nearly quarter of a millennium since Richard Tattersall founded his eponymous bloodstock auctioneers and, in 2013, Tattersalls' business is booming. Back in October behind the gates of Tattersalls Park Paddocks, a record was set for the most ever spent on a horse in Europe -- $8.4 million (£5.25 million) -- for the Galileo filly by Alluring Park. In a nod to its old roots, all sales are still priced in guineas (effectively a pound and a shilling) so Qatari Sheikh Joann al Thani parted with five million guineas for the honor of buying this prestigious filly. Excitement, though, is building at Tattersalls once more with the first offering from Frankel having retired and gone to stud with the pregnant Dancing Rain undoubtedly the most mouth-watering prospect going under the hammer at the two-week December sale, which starts on November 25. Dancing Rain won both the Oaks and its German equivalent and it is more than 50 years since an Oaks winner carrying her first foal has been sold in public auction. The fact the foal she is carrying is the offspring of Frankel, with 14 wins from as many races and undoubtedly the most acclaimed horse of its generation, makes the prospect all the more exciting. Jimmy George, the marketing director at Tattersalls, is loathe to say he expects the record to be broken but big money will undoubtedly change hands. ""We never expect to break records; records by their nature are unexpected,"" says George. ""We've got some huge excitement to come at the December sale with mares carrying the first Frankel foals,-- in all there are 10 mares in foal to Frankel -- of which Dancing Rain is the pick. That will be huge. ""This is the very best mated to the very best. Combining those two, you're narrowing the angles and quite possibly producing the ultimate racehorse. She's a very valuable mare particularly as it's very rare to find a mare of that calibre on the market."" Another horse set to test the spending power of horse racing's power brokers is Immortal Verse, winner of the Group 1 Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville, in foal for the first time to Dansili, whose wins included Priex Messidor, Prix Edmond Blanc and Prix du Muguet, and with an already impressive breeding record. ""Along with Dancing Rain, Immortal Verse promises to be the highlight of our December sale,"" adds George. ""That said, there's plenty others in there too."" In some ways, Tattersalls, which employs 45 full-time staff in Newmarket and another 20 at their Irish base in Fairyhouse, is like a different world. While much of the rest of the world is still feeling the economic pinch, it can at times act like a playground for global millionaires. In all, some 40 countries are expected to be represented at the December sale but there is no solitary powerbroker. British and Irish buyers, notably JP McMcManus and John Magnier, remain major players with an increasing number of established and emerging figures from the Middle East as well as an increasing number from the Far East. For all the money exchanged, there is a remarkably simple process to the Tattersalls sales. The horses come to Tattersalls pre-sale in one of the 850 stables on a 47-acre site and are there to be viewed by prospective buyers before being led into the sales ring. Once there, the auction begins. As the prices go up and up, George explains it is ""great theatre."" But he also admits: ""It's not quite like there are gasps. You have some people attending hoping to see drama and excitement unfold but the vast majority are there in a professional capacity. ""But there wasn't one person not caught up in the moment when that filly went for five million guineas."" With some 10,000 horses sold each year, the turnover of horses is rapid so, as such, almost as soon as the horses are bought, they are off to their new homes, once the necessary veterinary checks are carried out. Can a horse, though, ever truly be worth as much as five million guineas? No one at Tattersalls, which takes a 5% cut from each sale, is about to say so. But while there are the auction highlights, there are also immense bargains to be had. Treve, the French horse and winner of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, was snapped up at another auctioneers for a mere £50,000, a bargain considering its worth now after winning the $6.25 million Longchamp classic. By the same token, horses do not necessarily go on to live up to their high price tag, making such bidding a risky business, a type of high-risk poker. ""You get superstars whose first appearance in public is quite underwhelming,"" says George. ""That's one of the beauties of it. No one can predict the future so hence you get some surprises."" Once those horses are sold, though, Tattersalls work is not done and they continue to follow their progress for future potential worth and future potential sales. Tattersalls remains the name when it comes to bloodstock auctions but, as George points out, they still have to work at it. ""We're the world's first and Europe's largest but we have to work hard to keep the company in that position,"" he says. ""There's competition out there and the day we think there isn't, is the day we're in trouble. ""So we need to keep working hard, to build on our history and make sure we cover as many bases as we possibly can."" Last year, the company turnover was $355.4 million but still some way shy of the firm's record year in 2007 $411.4 million. Should the December sale be a success, Tattersalls are on course to match, possibly exceed that figure. With those sorts of numbers, the company looks likely to stay at the forefront of the industry for some time hence.","A look inside Tattersalls, the oldest bloodstock auction house in the world and biggest in Europe .

"Rason, North Korea (CNN) -- When Bernt Johansson crossed the mountainous countryside of North Korea into the city of Rason, the crowds there reminded the Swedish biker of the adulation that greeted his 1976 Olympic gold finish in Montreal. ""Street after street was packed with people. When I waved, they cheered. And when I waved with both hands they cheered even more,"" he said. ""It was fantastic."" North Korea is famous for many things -- allegations of human rights violations and nuclear missile threats for a start -- but not for co-hosting international sporting events. But when some 40 Western cyclists from seven countries crossed the Tumen River between China and North Korea early Monday morning, it was the first time that a bicycle race -- or any sports event -- had started in China and finished in North Korea, according to event organizers and local officials. Only a few months ago North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un threatened to attack both the United States and South Korea and told foreign embassies in Pyongyang to consider evacuating staff. Now, Seoul and Pyongyang have moved to ease tensions. At a wrestling competition earlier this month in North Korea, the South Korean national anthem was played and its flag raised for the first time since the division of the two countries. Last week, the joint industrial park in Kaesong -- one of the key symbols of cooperation between North and South Korea -- reopened after a five-month hiatus. The North Korean government also revealed plans last month to develop its tourism sector, starting direct flights to Pyongyang from China, Southeast Asia and Europe, according to North Korean state media Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). ""The North Korean government is clearly on a charm and smile offensive. They are being nicer to the outside world,"" said Professor Brian Bridges of the Lingnan University in Hong Kong ""We see a change of leadership style from the young leader, although we still haven't seen any change in economic policies or political reforms."" Monday's event, officially named ""Nordic Ways Vasa China - DPRKorea International Cycling Tourism Festival,"" was a non-timed 50-kilometer race that was part of a larger bicycle competition in the Jilin province, northeast China. Nordic Ways, a Swedish company that promotes Nordic-style sports in China, organized the race. ""We've been negotiating with the Chinese and North Koreans for more than a year,"" said Gåvert Wååg, chairman of Nordic Ways. ""With sport we build bridges and break boundaries. This gives North Korea a window to the West."" After leaving Chinese territory on Monday, the cyclists were bussed to the North Korean side of the river and then instructed to lead the bikes back to the middle of the bridge to re-start. While the cyclists were good humored, edgy border guards, guides and government officials carefully monitored their every move ahead of the mass start. The North Korean path was a demanding track, many bikers said, yet stunningly beautiful. Steep serpentine roads took the riders up to high peaks, offering breathtaking views of the scenic countryside with its widespread cornfields, pine trees and small villages. Peasants and villagers stood by the road. Some clapped, while curious children stood watching wide-eyed in amazement at the spectacle. Police officers posted alongside the roads occasionally gave a discreet nod as bikers passed. However, it was when the riders rolled into the city of Rason that the real magnitude of the event came into view. The streets were lined with thousands of cheering spectators, waving flags and taking photos with mobile phones. In buildings people were leaning out of windows or standing at balconies to get a glimpse of the Western cyclists, with state media following their every move. ""I've never experienced anything like this before,"" said 47-year-old Mike Evans from London after passing the finishing line. ""And I will probably never experience anything like it again."" Thirty-seven-year-old Brit Helen Simmenes from Norway said it was ""just wild"" and the greatest day in her life as a cyclist. It was also a big day for North Koreans. During the welcoming and prize ceremonies, high-ranking politicians praised international friendship and the development of economic cooperation with North Korea and the Rason Special Economic Zone. ""You who have participated in this international cycling tourism festival held in Rason city for friendship and development of relationship of economy and cooperation, (and you) will be able to see the beautiful view of Rason City which is developing to a world-class economic and trade city,"" Chon Dong Chol, head of the Rason tourism bureau, told the racers after the finish. ""You should be proud of yourself that you are the first foreign tourists who have visited northern seaside of the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea, the land of morning calm, by bicycle."" The entire event was steeped in propaganda. After the race, the bikers were entertained by a dance performance of little children with songs hailing the ""Great"" and ""Dear Leaders"" Kim Il Sung and his son, Kim Jong-Il. That was followed to a visit to a greenhouse full of flowers named after Kim Jong-Il and a foreign-language bookstore filled with tomes dedicated to the Kim dynasty. The day ended with a lavish dinner party at Rason's top hotel with plenty of boozing and singing. Although the participants were told to keep their opinions about the North Korean regime to themselves, many of the bikers quietly expressed reservations about the bizarre fact that starvation and labor camps were not far away from their oversized dinner tables. But unease about joining the event was tempered by the idea that ""something good may come from it,"" one biker said. But the signals being sent by North Korea on the international stage remained mixed. Pyongyang rescinded an invitation last month to a U.S. envoy to discuss American prisoner Kenneth Bae. Planned reunions of North and South Korean families were recently canceled. And satellite images of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility last month have again raised questions about whether the country has restarted its plutonium production reactor, which Western experts see as a key component in the development of a nuclear weapon. ""Unfortunately, what good comes out of these quiet and informal contacts could easily be erased as soon as North Korea starts threatening to shoot missiles again,"" Professor Bridges said.","Earlier this week, Western cyclists raced from China across the North Korean border .

"(Lonely Planet) -- So you're ready to go. You've booked your flight, arranged your accommodation and booked a rental car. Awaiting is a week of motoring through Italy's magical countryside. But what's it really like to drive in Italy? Is it as nerve-wracking as it's made out to be? Do you need the skills of a Formula One driver to cut it on the nation's dog-eat-dog superstrade? Certainly, driving in Italy's main cities can be a white-knuckle experience but head out to the country and you'll find that the pace slackens and the roads are a lot less stressful. To help you on your way here are some insights based on years of experience and tens of thousands of kilometers. Lonely Planet: Italy for honeymooners . Driving styles . Italian drivers are fast, aggressive and skillful. Lane hopping and late braking are the norm and it's not uncommon to see cars tailgating at 130km/h. Don't expect people to slow down for you or let you out. Rather, seize the moment. As soon as you see a gap, go for it. Italians expect the unexpected and react swiftly but they're not used to ditherers so whatever you do, do it decisively. Road etiquette . Much driving etiquette is dictated by unwritten rules. Flashing, for example, means 'Get out of the way' or 'Don't pull out 'coz I'm not stopping'. But if an approaching car flashes you, it's warning you that there's a police check ahead. Similarly, the car horn can mean everything from 'Watch out' to 'Ciao' to 'Let's celebrate, the traffic light's just turned green'. City challenges . When driving in cities watch out for traffic restrictions. Many city centers are off-limits to unauthorized traffic and if you slip into a ZTL (zona a traffico limitato -- reduced traffic zone) you risk being caught on camera and fined. City driving also involves dealing with one-way systems, scooters appearing out of nowhere and narrow streets better suited to horse-drawn chariots than modern cars. To escape the worst mayhem, drive in the early afternoon when traffic is at its lightest and parking is easier. Which brings us to... Parking . Parking is a major headache. Space is at a premium in towns and cities and Italy's traffic wardens are annoyingly efficient. Car parks do exist but they usually fill up quickly, leaving you to park on the streets. If you park between blue lines make sure to get a ticket from the nearest meter (coins only) or tabaccaio (tobacconist) and display it on your dashboard. Note, however, that charges don't apply overnight, typically between 8pm and 8am. Lonely Planet: Driving Burgundy's Route des Grands Cru . Petrol stations . You'll find filling stations all over but smaller ones tend to close between about 1pm and 3.30pm and on Sunday afternoons. This isn't as irritating as it might sound as many have self-service (fai da te) pumps that you can use any time. Simply insert a bank note into the payment machine and press the number of the pump you want. Remembering, of course, to distinguish between benzina (petrol) and gasolio (diesel). What to carry in the car . Apart from your driving license, car documents, insurance papers and reflective safety vest, which you're legally obliged to carry, it's worth having some coins for parking meters. Also, if you're travelling with kids, keep some plastic bags to hand. Car sickness is a real possibility on winding country roads and things can prove messy unless you're prepared. Car hire . Hiring a car in Italy is easy enough -- agencies are widespread and all the usual rules and regulations apply. But bear in mind that a car is generally more hassle than it's worth in cities, so only hire one for the time you'll be out on the open road. Also, think about what kind of car to get. Rural road surfaces are not always the best and many agriturismi and beaches lie at the end of long, axle-busting tracks. Similarly, road signs can be iffy in remote areas, so consider paying for sat nav. Top drives . Here are a few roads to try out. • Bolzano to Cortina d'Ampezzo, Dolomites. • Montepulciano to Montalcino via Pienza, Tuscany . • Sulmona to Pescasseroli via Scanno, Abruzzo . • Chia to Porto Teulada, Costa del Sud, Sardinia . • Vietri sul Mare to Sorrento, Amalfi Coast, Campania . • Potenza to Metaponto, Basilicata .

"(CNN) -- It was a big year for women, 2013. In the past 12 months, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg called on her fellow females to ""lean in"" to their careers. And lean in they did: Janet Yellen was nominated to become the first woman to head the U.S. Federal Reserve and General Motors named Mary Barra the auto industry's first female CEO. In a new epilogue to her book ""The End of Men: And the Rise of Women,"" Hanna Rosin wrote that, thanks in part to strong political women like Kirsten Gillibrand, Tammy Baldwin and Claire McCaskill, the patriarchy is officially dead. But not all landmark moves by women were points scored. A few of the year's biggest missteps serve as powerful reminders of what NOT to do in 2014: . Say things in private that you wouldn't in public: As part of a lawsuit filed by a former employee, erstwhile beloved celebrity chef Paula Deen admitted to having used racial slurs, including the N-word, and admiring a plantation-style event where the ""whole entire wait staff was middle-aged black men."" It was a particularly ironic revelation, given that she'd built her reputation on being something of a comforting, maternal figure. She was promptly fired by the Food Network and lost endorsements with, among others, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Target, and Sears. Tweet without thinking: Just before the holiday, PR exec Justine Sacco pressed send on a last-minute tweet before boarding a 12-hour flight: ""Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!"" She had just a few hundred followers at the time. But the Internet has a way of making the intimate go viral, and by the time Sacco landed in South Africa, she was the biggest Internet story of the week. She endured public excoriation and, ultimately, lost her job. And though Sacco's words were insensitive at best, the outrage that followed -- which included some death threats -- proved that Sacco isn't exactly the only one lacking empathy. Tell only half the story: Lara Logan's deeply flawed report on Benghazi that aired on ""60 Minutes"" threatened the long-running news program's credibility and called into question journalistic practices across the board. The worst part: The mistake was avoidable, according to a CBS review that stated the accounts provided by the report's key source differed from versions provided to the FBI. As a result, Logan and her producer were suspended. Stay silent in the face of criticism. When the website for Obamacare launched -- or, more accurately, failed to launch -- it was Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius who took most of the heat. Millions called for her firing, and the voices only grew louder as Sebelius initially refused to testify  before Congress about the nearly inoperable website. Muddle the message. Miley Cyrus' butt-shaking, foam-finger-waving performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in August was a lesson in how shock sells. Though the act spawned much outrage -- Vogue reportedly pulled its plans to feature her on the cover, and longtime boyfriend Liam Hemsworth moved on  as well -- album sales climbed. But then she followed it up with a topless photo shoot with Terry Richardson; a not-quite-pornographic music video; and an admission that, yes, she is singing about drugs (sorry, kids!). In the end, the takeaway was clear: The act overshadows the talent. Chances are good that as we move into 2014, it's the foam finger we'll remember more than Miley's songs. Use shame to motivate. California mother of three Maria Kang became headline news for a photograph she posted to her Facebook account in which she appeared toned and tanned in a sports bra and short shorts beneath the provocative caption, ""What's Your Excuse?"" After the photo went viral -- and Kang was bashed for ""fat shaming"" -- she claimed she'd only intended to motivate others. What ensued brought out bullies on both sides, and served to undermine any positive conversation Kang might have envisioned. The fact is that by posting the photo, Kang was issuing judgment on others. And she was judged in return. Assume all women want the same things. Even one of the year's more inspiring messages for women contained elitist notes: In calling for women to ""lean in"" to their careers, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg assumed that all women want to ""have it all"" -- or even want the same things, period. Her book, ""Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,"" ignited a powerful discussion. But in some ways her experiences are so far from the norm of the majority of women in the workforce, and her edict about what women ""should do"" is so absolute, that her larger message, unfortunately, got lost at times. Frida Ghitis: 10 women who shaped 2013 . Of course, 2013 was filled with many gains -- Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis' pro-choice filibuster, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer standing by her decision to ban working from home, then seeing the company's stock soar, and Angelina Jolie's very public double mastectomy among them. For every errant twerk, pop culture saw its share of positive messages for women, including Malala Yousafzai's ""I Am Malala"" -- a Pakistani girl's tale of being shot by the Taliban for speaking out about the rights of women -- and the consistent challenging of the Hollywood body ideal in Lena Dunham's ""Girls."" Missteps are part of the normal course of life; they aren't a step back. But it's key to remember, as we enter 2014, as women make greater strides in the battle toward complete gender equity, that their words and actions matter. Greater gains, after all, also mean more people are watching. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Peggy Drexler: 2013 saw big gains for women but some mistakes we can all learn from .
She says Paula Deen, Kathleen Sebelius, Miley Cyrus, Lara Logan were some who stumbled .
Drexler: Janet Yellen, Mary Barra were among the trailblazers in the rise of women this year ."
"London (CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II can expect a sweet 5% raise next year, thanks in large part to record profits from real estate. The Crown Estate, a public body that manages property for the monarch, posted a record profit of 252.6 million British pounds ($387.2 million) for the last financial year -- up by 5.2% from last year. The good news for the nation is that all the profit from the estate is paid into the public coffers. The queen is then paid a grant each year by the Treasury equal to 15% of the profit from two years before. That means the monarch, who celebrated 60 years on the throne last year, will receive income of nearly 38 million pounds next year, according to the estate's annual report, released Thursday. The Crown Estate is owned by the queen as monarch but is not her private property, meaning she has no direct control over it. The total portfolio is now valued at 8.1 billion pounds (nearly $12.4 billion). The estate's revenue comes from everything from chic central London stores to offshore wind farms and rural housing developments. Even U.S. retailer J. Crew helped swell its profits in the last year -- it's one of a number of international brands to open a new store on Regent Street, in the heart of London. Apple, Banana Republic and Anthropologie are three more of the big American firms to find a home on the Crown Estate-owned street. As for energy production, about 300 new offshore wind turbines came on line over the year. The estate manages almost all of Britain's coastal waters and some of its finest parkland, including Windsor Great Park, by Windsor Castle. It is also one of the country's largest rural landowners, holding about 356,000 acres of agricultural land and forests, together with mineral resources, homes and commercial property. In the past year, it put 250,000 pounds into creating new mountain bike trails at the Glenlivet estate in Scotland and invested 1 million pounds to support coastal communities and care of the marine environment. According to its website, the estate's vision ""is to be the UK's most respected property business because of the way in which we manage this portfolio of assets on behalf of the nation."" Overspending . The queen's grant for 2012-2013 totaled 31 million pounds, jumping to just over 36 million pounds for the current financial year. She spent 2.3 million pounds more than the allotted grant last year -- when she was ""exceptionally busy"" with travel and events to mark the diamond jubilee -- the annual report said. The extra cost was met from a reserve fund. The queen had 288 public engagements in the year to March 31, 2013, and her husband, Prince Philip, had 275, the report said. The queen didn't travel abroad in the last financial year, but other members of the royal family, including Princes William and Harry, undertook 30 foreign engagements on her behalf. Spending last year on royal properties included 700,000 pounds (just over $1 million) so far on the refurbishment of an apartment at Kensington Palace for William and his wife, Catherine, who are expecting their first child in July. Work on the apartment, which was built to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren, architect of London's landmark St. Paul's Cathedral, is due to be completed this fall. The ""Sovereign Grant"" came into effect in April of last year, after the passage of new legislation that consolidated public funding for the monarch's official duties and royal palaces in return for the profits from the Crown Estate. The queen has her own private estate, which includes Balmoral, in Scotland, and Sandringham, her country retreat in Norfolk. The Crown Estate's record profits will be welcome news for the Treasury, as the government struggles to bring the nation's debt and spending under control. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced more cuts to public spending Wednesday in his 2013 Spending Review. CNN's Susannah Palk and Max Foster contributed to this report.","NEW: Spending last year includes $1 million for work on apartment for William, Catherine .

"(CNN) -- Admit it. Just once in your life you'd like to feel like the hero in a chick flick, with all the schmaltzy romance, the elaborate plots, the happy endings. Even if it's just for the amount of time it takes to say those big four words: Will. You. Marry. Me. You want it to be in someplace exotic: in a romantic setting, away from family and friends, on a vacation never to forget. Prince William certainly wanted it that way. He trekked around Kenya carrying Princess Diana's ring in his backpack until he found just the right place to propose to Kate Middleton. In a remote log cabin with no electricity that was accessible only by air or -- bizarrely -- horseback, Wills got down on one knee and asked Kate to be the future queen of England. It was the ultimate destination proposal, and it shows William knew exactly what was expected of a 21st-century proposal. The proposal trip: cashing in on the trend . If there wasn't already a growing trend for guys to pop the question on vacation, then this single event made it one. It was one royal move that men everywhere could confidently copy (if not in Kenya, exactly). When Phil Govey asked Rachel Amamoo to marry him in front of the Trevi Fountain in Rome, Rachel says time stopped, just like in the movies. ""It was kind of like we were in a little bubble, because there were lots of people around, but it was like it was just us two,"" she says. ""It was so romantic."" David Mendelsohn got it equally right when he proposed to his girlfriend, Isika, in Lake Como, Italy. ""Everything fell into place like it was prewritten,"" says David. He proposed beneath a 200-year-old oak tree made famous by the James Bond film ""Casino Royale."" Isika said yes, and, she added, ""By the way, I'm pregnant."" Destination proposals are now de rigeur in the story of a couple's romance, according to Jonathan Krywicki, whose Melbourne, Australia-based company Pitch & Woo helps guys create unforgettable proposals for their girlfriends. Krywicki says one in three of his clients plan to propose while away from home, often while abroad. A consumer survey by American Express found a similar result, with 30% of consumers citing a weekend trip or vacation as the best time to pop the question. ""It's a really popular thing to propose while you're away from home because it's all about creating that fairytale fantasy,"" says Krywicki. ""There's something about being in an unknown area that adds to the allure of the moment."" The right way to ask . The proposal doesn't have to be overly complicated, as long as the setting is right. Just ask Naomi Tarszisz, whose husband proposed to her in Central Park. They were visiting friends in New York at the time and Phil Rushton was carrying a diamond in his pocket. Walking around the city on an overcast April day, Rushton decided all his ideas -- the top of the Empire State Building had been at the head of the list -- were lame, so he guided Naomi to a green patch of lawn in Central Park. They sat down for a chat and the sun suddenly appeared. When Naomi stood to leave, Rushton got on one knee and said, ""Naomi, will you do something for me? Will you make me the happiest man in the world; will you marry me?"" Being asked was nice, says Naomi. Being on holiday in the couple's favorite city was great, but being able to look directly into her future husband's eyes made it perfect. ""He got up on one knee,"" says Naomi, who is a foot shorter than Rushton. ""I appreciate the down-on-one-knee gesture, but it's also just the easiest way to look into my eyes. ""I hadn't imagined a proposal, but if I did it probably would have been on an escalator or something."" Knowing your partner -- and her expectations about the proposal -- are the key to proposal success, says Krywicki. In his booklet, ""The Seven Biggest Mistakes Men Make When Proposing,"" Krywicki says the first mistake is timing. Is she ready? Is your relationship ready? The second is expectation. ""You really need to know what her expectations are,"" Krywicki says. ""Most women, not all of them, but most women have this fantasy of how this special day will take place. ""Now, if you've got a partner that's innately private and you go and do a public proposal and she feels pressured to say yes because everybody's looking at her -- that's not a good thing."" The wrong kind of obligation . If only Kirsten Thomas's ex-fiance had been operating with such expert advice. He proposed while the couple was on holiday in South Africa, only to break it off 10 days later. When she asked why he'd proposed in the first place, he told her he'd felt pressured to carry it out while they were on vacation. Which begs the question: Is planning a ""destination proposal"" all becoming a bit of an industry, something so expected that it's no longer a surprise, even a bit clichÃ©? Rachel and Phil's romance had all the hallmarks of a fairy tale. They met in New York while Phil was on a secondment from his London law firm and began dating casually. Then, one day when they were running a half-marathon together, Phil suffered an aneurism and was rushed to the hospital in a coma. Rachel kept vigil at his bedside and when he woke, they fell in love over a tray of bad hospital food. Rachel eventually moved to London to be with Phil and expected a proposal would follow. ""I was kind of expecting a destination proposal for a long time,"" says Rachel. ""Every trip we went on -- Paris, New York, Corsica, Sicily -- I was always like, 'Oh, this is romantic' waiting for the proposal that didn't come."" Then they took a trip to Rome and it happened. While the moment was romantic -- let's not forget the bubble she found herself in -- the story they tell these days is more about how that bubble was burst by a street vendor trying to sell them a rose. ""That really brought us back into the commercial aspect of hanging out around the Trevi Fountain in Rome,"" says Rachel. Perhaps Katherine Burgdorf got the balance right when she proposed on a park bench during a coffee break from work. The big surprise here is not that she was a woman proposing to her boyfriend, but that it was a warm, sunny day in London. ""It was a beautiful day, so we went and had a coffee at our favorite coffee stand,"" says Katherine. ""We sat on a park bench under a beautiful apple tree. ""I think I was overwhelmed by the weather and I thought, 'Oh my God, I'm going to ask!' ""I totally surprised myself. I had the shakes afterward. And he was like, 'Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.""' Did you get engaged while on vacation? Wish you had? Share your story in the comments section below.","The site of the proposal is a big part of the story of the modern couple's romance .

"(CNN) -- Spain international Santi Cazorla has joined English Premier League club Arsenal from Malaga on a long-term deal. The versatile midfielder has been signed for an undisclosed sum -- believed to be around $23.5 million -- with the length of his contract also unspecified by Arsenal. The 27-year-old was a key player in the Malaga side, which finished fourth in La Liga last season to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in the club's history. ""Santi Cazorla is a great signing for us,"" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said. ""He is a player with good experience at both club and international level, who will add significant quality to our squad. ""He is a versatile, attacking midfield player who can play comfortably on either side of the pitch or centrally. He has good pace, is technically gifted and will be a huge asset to Arsenal."" Will big football club's beat Financial Fair Play rules? Named Spanish Player of the Year in 2007, Cazorla joined Malaga in 2011 following two stints with Villarreal. He has been capped 45 times by Spain, and was part of their winning squad at this year's European Championships and in 2008. ""I'm so excited to be joining one of the greatest teams in Europe and also in the Premier League,"" he said. ""I will do my best to help Arsenal challenge for trophies and make all the supporters happy."" 'Supporter for sale' finds new home at Spurs . Malaga recently announced it was undergoing a process of ""internal restructuring,"" with owner Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nassar Al-Thani -- a member of the Qatar royal family -- reportedly wanting to sell up after only two years. Cazorla's arrival at Arsenal follows the club's summer signings of Germany forward Lukas Podolski and France international striker Olivier Giroud. With the start of the Premier League season less than a fortnight away, the focus will now switch to whether Arsenal captain Robin van Persie will stay at the Emirates. Last month the Dutch striker, who has a year left on his contract, revealed his intention not to sign a new deal with the London club. So far Manchester United, Manchester City and Juventus have made bids for the 28-year-old -- all of which have been rejected by Arsenal. ""I've thought long and hard about it, but I have decided not to extend my contract,"" said Van Persie. ""You guys, the fans, have of course the right to disagree with my view and decision and I will always respect your opinions.""","Spanish footballer Santi Cazorla joins Arsenal for undisclosed sum .

"(CNN) -- A total of 20 pilot whales have been found dead on an island off southwestern Florida, possibly driven ashore by high seas, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday. A boater reported the whales early Thursday afternoon near Kice Island, south of Naples, said Blair Mase, NOAA's Southeastern stranding coordinator. Their bodies were found above the normal tide line, suggesting that seas whipped by strong westerly winds may have led to their running aground, Mase said. It's the second time this week that pods of pilot whales, which can reach sizes up to 25 feet, have found themselves in danger off the state's southwest coast. Of the 14 whales that were found off a state park near Fort Myers on Monday, eight died, including one pregnant female, NOAA said. Necropsies on those animals have produced no significant findings that would point to a cause of death, Mase said. Some of the whales appeared emaciated, but others appeared to be in good shape, she said. And in December, 51 pilot whales were stranded on the edge of Everglades National Park; only 29 survived. About 2,400 pilot whales are believed to live in the Gulf of Mexico, according to NOAA.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Students at a high school in Virginia prepared Thursday for the funeral of a popular classmate, the victim of a deadly drug-resistant strain of bacteria that has turned up in schools across the country recently. It's called MRSA, short for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and is responsible for more deaths in the United States each year than AIDS, according to new data. Ashton Bonds was a senior at Staunton River High School in Moneta, Virginia, who was diagnosed with MRSA. ""I was standing beside his bed and ... I said, 'Baby, we're supposed to be having a graduation this year, you've got to come up out of this and get better,' "" his mother, Veronica Bonds, remembered.  After struggling with the infection for a week, the 17-year-old died on Monday. Students at his school organized a rally, saying the school needed to be cleaned up before they went back to class. ""If we sent the whole student body back into the school, then more people would just come down [with] it and maybe even result in another death,"" student Chelsea Woods told CNN. ""So we sent out a bunch of text messages, got on MySpace and posted a few bulletins, and decided to have a rally around the flagpole to make sure this doesn't happen again.""  Watch crews disinfect schools in Bedford County, Virginia » . Another Staunton River student, Ashleigh Shuffler, told CNN's ""American Morning"" she took the school superintendent on a tour of the school. ""We walked around the school, showed him a couple of bathrooms and the hallways and pointed out everything that wasn't sanitary and he was very surprised,"" she said. ""I don't think he realized we were as serious as we were.  I think he thought we were exaggerating."" Officials closed all 22 schools in Bedford County for cleaning this week. The situation at Staunton River High was not an isolated incident. On Wednesday, school officials in Connecticut confirmed that one student at Weston High School and one at Newtown High School had been diagnosed with MRSA. In Rockville, Maryland, at least 13 students have been diagnosed with MRSA. Cases have been reported in Ohio, Michigan and other states. Although school principals have observed that the bacteria predominantly affects student athletes, cases have been reported in children of elementary school age as well. A study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that MRSA infections occurred in nearly 95,000 Americans in 2005. Based on those figures, an estimated 18,650 people died due to their MRSA infection in 2005. That death rate is higher than the HIV/AIDS death rate for that year, and the number of MRSA related deaths is much higher than previously thought. Pat Mshar, an epidemiologist for Connecticut's Department of Health -- which contributed data to the JAMA study -- said the consolidation of statistics was groundbreaking. ""This is the first time that we've been able to measure this in a population basis in which we've been able to quantify the impact,"" she said. According to the Centers for Disease Control, some 25 to 30 percent of the population carry staphylococcus bacteria -- one of the most common causes of infection -- in their bodies. While such infections are usually minor, invasive MRSA infections can become fatal because they are caused by drug-resistant staph. Dr. Julie Gerberding, the director of the CDC, says these infections are not new. ""It's important to appreciate that many of these infections are the same infections moms have been dealing with for decades. They're very preventable,"" she says. ""If you see a skin infection that looks like the redness is getting bigger or if it's associated with a lot of swelling around the wound or if the individual has a fever, those are reasons to definitely seek doctor's attention. But most of the time these are things that can be treated with the same kind of common sense approach that is we've been using for years."" Mshar emphasized that the highest rate of MRSA deaths -- 58 percent -- is found in hospitals. ""The healthy person in the community -- like the high school student -- generally is going to be able to be treated adequately without adverse outcome,"" she said. So long as an infected student seeks treatment, covers open cuts or lesions and avoids direct skin contact with other students, ""it's OK to go to school."" ""Certainly the publication of the article and the death of the student has heightened concern,"" she said. ""Parents are more aware of MRSA now than they ever were before."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- In the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, Seattle Seahawks player Derrick Coleman Jr. probably expected an onslaught of encouragement from his fans. But one earnest letter from a young fan posted on Twitter stood out, prompting the Super Bowl-bound fullback to write his own heartfelt response. The letter-writer was identified as 9-year-old Riley Kovalcik, who is hearing impaired, according to CNN affiliate KOMO. Kovalick is from Roxbury, New Jersey. In a hand-written letter tweeted to the player, Kovalcik tells Coleman that she, like him, wears hearing aids. Her father tweeted the player a photo of the letter. Coleman is the first legally deaf offensive player in the NFL. ""Here are some things we have in comen [sic],"" Kovalcik wrote in the note, which her father posted online. ""I where [sic] two hearing aids. I love sports."" Kovalcik goes on to say that her identical twin sister also wears hearing aids, and wishes Coleman luck in the Super Bowl. ""Just try your best,"" she wrote. Riley's father, Jake Kovalcik, tweeted the letter to Coleman on Tuesday, accompanied by the message: ""You've inspired my little girls in a way I never could. THANK YOU!"" The tweet quickly made the rounds on social media, spurring a hand-written response, which Coleman posted on Wednesday. ""Thanks for the letter,"" Coleman wrote. ""Really was great hearing from a friend who I have so much in common with. I appreciate you rooting for the Seahawks and me and hope you continue to do so when we play in the Superbowl!!!"" ""Even though we wear hearing aids, we can still accomplish our goals & dreams,"" he wrote. In a CNN.com column in December, the fullback said that being deaf has ""made me who I am."" ""The struggle, pain, tears, happiness and joy has put me in the position where I am today,"" he said.","Seahawks fullback Derrick Coleman Jr. is NFL's first legally deaf offensive player .

"(CNN) -- They called him ""Scary Gary."" Gary Shteyngart had a bong named Big Blue. There's a photo of him in his new memoir, ""Little Failure,"" high on mushrooms. Another photo shows him drunk. He was a one-man party. In one scene in the book, he is carried out of his Oberlin dormitory because his loud merrymaking disturbed his roommate. (Or maybe he was carried into his dormitory. He doesn't remember.) At his Manhattan high school, he spent three years ""drunk and stoned."" Or so he claims. But mostly he says he struggled to fit in. Throughout his life, well before college or high school, he confesses to feeling lonely, or angry, or anxious. Rarely genuinely happy. Could this really be Gary Shteyngart? The laugh-out-loud author of ""Absurdistan"" and ""Super Sad True Love Story""? The Gary Shteyngart who can find absurdist comedy in overseas revolutions, economic collapse and small electric appliances? That Gary Shteyngart? One and the same, says the author in a phone interview from a tour stop in Los Angeles. ""The truth of the matter is I was a jerk in many, many ways,"" he says. 'Humor is the armor' Let's be clear: Shteyngart didn't rob a bank or maim an old widow. He was merely a bright kid who was sometimes out of control. Still, ""Little Failure"" is an attempt to revisit his life -- that of the Russian Jewish immigrant who made his way in the United States -- and get at the root of his woe. Much of it originated at home with loving but wounding parents. Shteyngart was born in 1972 and spent the first seven years of his life in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), in an apartment with a Russian TV that was always in danger of exploding. His parents, stifled in many ways, bickered. When his family moved to the United States, he couldn't help but be impressed by the riches of the West. ""We didn't have to go to a store in order to feel like we were someplace completely and insanely (different). You land at the international arrivals building -- the Pan Am terminal -- at JFK and it's shaped like a flying saucer. It looked like something from the 21st century,"" he recalls. ""You saw a Chevrolet Corvette and wondered if this was an airplane without wings on the ground."" It took time to make the adjustment, he observes, especially since finding his way at school was as difficult as doing so at home. It helped that he had a nimble mind. In the book, he talks about the stories he wrote, including a rewrite of the Torah; he called it the ""Gnorah,"" after his adolescent nickname, ""Gnu."" He details the long stretches of the computer game Zork he played with his friend Jonathan. Shteyngart being Shteyngart, he can't help but make the mundane amusing. His family came over with orange suitcases (and dark jackets) of ""real Polish leather."" The boy popping a wheelie on the box of Honeycomb cereal becomes ""an important role model."" His family receives a letter from Publishers Clearing House, addressed to ""Mr. S. Sh*tgart,"" and believes it has just won $10 million -- though, to be sure the judges approve, he and his parents fill out everything and sign up for several magazines. Even the later stories, about his drunkenness and a disturbed girlfriend, have a comic spin. This laughter in the face of sadness comes naturally given his Russian-Jewish heritage, says Shteyngart. ""I'd call it 'laughter from the edge of the grave,' "" he says. ""Yes, it's quite tragic, but at the same time, if you don't laugh at it, the other solution is to wrap yourself in a shawl and die. Humor is the armor and the sword that you are given."" 'I tried to write this in the most loving way I could' He says he had lots of help in putting together ""Little Failure."" He interviewed family and friends, including an old girlfriend who had saved his lengthy letters. ""I was very grateful she'd done that,"" he says. ""Because, as readers will know, at Oberlin I wasn't sober 100% of the time, (so) it was very helpful to discover these letters and reconstruct what had happened."" Reviewers have approved. "" 'Little Failure' is as entertaining as it's moving,"" wrote Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times. "" 'Little Failure' ... is a much more straightforwardly soulful account than many of his readers might expect.,"" wrote Lisa Zeidner in the Washington Post. Shteyngart still hasn't heard from his most important reviewers, however: his parents. He hopes he did right by them. ""I tried to write this in the most loving way I could, because I do love them very much. They made a lot of sacrifices."" But there's still a language barrier. ""Their English may not have all the nuances needed to read something like this. I'm usually translated into Russian, so I think the ultimate test is to see what they think of a version published in Russian,"" he says. However, he says that another observer, his longtime psychoanalyst, hasn't disapproved. Of course, he hasn't approved, either. ""I'm such a bad analysand. In traditional Freudian analysis you're supposed to lie there, and instead I whip out my phone and start typing in the stuff that just came up so I won't forget exactly how it happened,"" he says. ""And because it's traditional analysis, the analyst doesn't rebuke me or say anything, so I get away with it."" Maybe, he adds, the book is a capstone of sorts, and it's time to move on, anyway. He's already progressed, he says. ""Unlike most New Yorkers I only see mine four times a week as opposed to the five times a week that's traditional. So I'm something of an outlier,"" he says. ""But it's only been 12 years and we're ready to stop soon.""","Gary Shteyngart's new book is a memoir, ""Little Failure""

"(CNN) -- Former Bosnian Serb army chief Ratko Mladic refused to testify Tuesday at the genocide trial of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in the Netherlands and denounced the U.N.-backed court as ""satanic."" Both men are on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, or ICTY, for their role in the conflict that followed the breakup of the former Yugoslavia two decades ago. But Mladic said he does not recognize the court in The Hague and rejects it as satanic. ""It is not a court of justice, and it is trying us because we are Serbs and are trying to protect our people from you,"" he said. The former army chief, who was arrested in May 2011 after a decade on the run, is being tried separately from his former ally, Karadzic, but was called Tuesday as a defense witness in latter's trial. Mladic agreed to answer only the first of six questions put to him -- on the positions held during his military career -- arguing that his testimony could harm his own case. Karadzic faces two counts of genocide, among other charges, one of which relates to the massacre of nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in July 1995. The second question put to Mladic by Karadzic's defense was, ""Did you ever inform me, orally or in writing, that prisoners in Srebrenica would be, were being, or had been executed?"" The next was, ""Did we have any agreement or understanding that the citizens of Sarajevo should be subjected to terror by shelling and sniping?"" Mladic was also asked about the reasons for the shelling and sniping in Sarajevo, and what he had told Karadzic. More than 10,000 people, most of them civilians, died in the lengthy siege of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, by Bosnian Serb forces that pounded the city every day from higher ground. Mladic was also asked if he and Karadzic had any agreement ""to expel Muslims or Croats residing in Serb-controlled areas"" -- a question related to the second genocide charge faced by Karadzic. Karadzic: From psychiatrist to 'Butcher of Bosnia' Elaborate disguise . The court proceedings are now in recess, the ICTY said. There was already an early break in proceedings after Mladic asked to be brought his dentures before he answered questions, said ICTY spokeswoman Magdalena Spalinska. Karadzic was captured in 2008 after more than 13 years of hiding in plain sight in Belgrade. He had adopted an elaborate disguise that included long hair and a full beard, and was practicing alternative medicine in the Serbian capital. His trial started in 2009, and the prosecution rested its case in May 2012. The defense case began in October of that year. Mladic is accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in a trial that began in 2011. Both men would face life in prison if convicted. The court cannot impose the death penalty. Balkans conflicts . The ICTY is still prosecuting a number of cases of alleged war crimes committed during the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. The Srebrenica massacre became an emblem of the dissolution of Yugoslavia -- once a multiethnic state of Serbs, Croats, Muslims and others -- into six countries during a bloody and brutal conflict. Other defendants at the court include Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic, accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes; and Vojislav Seselj, a Serb nationalist politician who faces charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The tribunal says ""the most significant number"" of its cases have dealt with alleged crimes by Serbians or Bosnian Serbs. But there have been convictions for crimes against Serbs by others, including Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Kosovo Albanians.

"(CNN) -- The Philippines has reached a preliminary agreement with Muslim rebels after 15 years of talks, the president announced Sunday, marking a major milestone after decades of militant insurgency in the nation's troubled south. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front has fought for decades for an independent Islamic state in southern Philippines. It has been blamed for rampant attacks in the region. President Benigno Aquino III described the deal as a ""framework agreement"" for establishing a new autonomous region to be administered by Muslims in the south. It comes after 15 years of negotiations between the government and the rebels. 2009: Rebels bomb electricity tower, official says . ""This framework agreement paves the way for a final, enduring peace in Mindanao,"" Aquino said. ""It brings all former secessionist groups into the fold; no longer does the Moro Islamic Liberation Front aspire for a separate state."" It also provides a framework on issues such as power structure and revenues in the southern region. ""This means that hands that once held rifles will be put to use tilling land, selling produce, manning work stations and opening doorways of opportunity for other citizens,"" he said. The new autonomous region will be named Bangsamoro. ""It deserves a name that symbolizes and honors the struggles of our forebears in Mindanao, and celebrates the history and character of that part of our nation,"" the president said. The preliminary deal marks a major milestone after years of negotiations with the Moro group to help end an insurgency that has killed tens of thousands. The Moro group is estimated to have 12,000 members, but military sources say it may have been splintered when government troops conducted offensives in 2000. British and American officials applauded the agreement. ""I wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of the framework agreement ... to bring peace and development to Muslim Mindanao,"" Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. ""This is a testament to the commitment and vision of the parties."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the agreement ""a testament to the commitment of all sides for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the southern Philippines."" The new region is expected to replace the current one by 2016, when the president's term ends, according to officials. Ex-Philippines president arrested on corruption charges . Journalist Maria A.

"(CNN) -- Facebook follows you everywhere. It's on phones and computers, at work and home, and in the news. So it's understandable that people might need a little rest from the social network. New research suggests that Facebook fatigue may be setting in with some users. Twenty-seven percent of Facebook users surveyed in the U.S. plan to spend less time on the site in 2013, compared with only 3% who plan to spend more time, according to a study from the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. (Another 69% of Facebook users say they plan to spend the same amount of time on the site this coming year.) The Pew study also found that 61% of Facebook users have taken a break from the service for several weeks or more. During these breaks, the vast majority of Facebook vacationers don't delete their profiles. The site boasts that it has more than a billion active users. Pew found that two-thirds, or 67%, of American adults who are online use Facebook. The reasons people gave for taking a sabbatical from the network were varied. The most common motivation was not having enough time for the site, with 21% of people saying they were just too busy with real-life responsibilities to spend time reading posts, liking and commenting. Other reasons for leaving: Ten percent called it a waste of time, 10% cited a lack of interest in the content, and 9% said they were unhappy with the amount of drama and gossip on the site. Only 4% of people mentioned privacy and security concerns as their reason for taking a breather. Among the comments from those who took Facebook breaks: ""I was tired of stupid comments."" ... ""(I had) crazy friends. I did not want to be contacted."" ... ""I took a break when it got boring."" ... ""It was not getting me anywhere."" ... ""You get burned out on it after a while."" ... ""I gave it up for Lent."" ... ""People were (posting) what they had for dinner."" ... ""I didn't like being monitored."" ... ""I got harassed by someone from my past who looked me up.""... ""It caused problems in my (romantic) relationship."" Not everyone who leaves Facebook comes back to the site. According to Pew, 20% of online adults who currently don't use Facebook formerly maintained a profile on the site. The number of Facebook users in the U.S. may be plateauing, as only 8% of non-users said they would be interested in joining. Mark Zuckerberg's company needs to keep its users active on the site and mobile apps, especially since the pool of untapped of potential new members in the U.S. is dwindling. If Facebook starts to feel stale, more of its active users could take longer breaks or leave altogether, like they did with such formerly hot social networks as Friendster and MySpace.","Pew Research study: 61% of Facebook users have taken a break from the site .

"(CNN) -- Minors under 17 will be prohibited from using commercial tanning beds in New Jersey, and those under 14 will be banned from spray-tanning procedures in tanning facilities, under a new law signed by Gov. Chris Christie. In remarks made at the time he signed the bill Monday, Christie noted that New Jersey already banned those under 14 from using tanning facilities. But, he said, ""the new restrictions imposed by this bill followed a single, but breathlessly reported, incident of a parent bringing a minor child into a tanning facility."" In February, a New Jersey grand jury declined to indict a woman accused of child endangerment for allegedly allowing her 5-year-old daughter to use a tanning bed, resulting in leg burns. Patricia Krentcil was arrested in April 2012 after school officials noticed burns on the girl's legs and reported the injuries. Prosecutors accused her of allowing her daughter inside a stand-up tanning booth at a salon in the northern New Jersey town of Nutley. Christie said Monday the child was not permanently injured and the salon was fined by the state Department of Health. ""Confidence in the current laws, rather than a rush to add new and perhaps unnecessary provisions, would have seemed the appropriate legislative response,"" the governor said. ""Nonetheless, I sign this bill because of the documented and well-understood risks associated with misuse of indoor tanning systems."" California and Vermont have also banned indoor tanning for minors, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Wisconsin also prohibits indoor tanning for those under age 16. A handful of other states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Oregon, Michigan and Virginia, require parental permission. Indoor tanning exposes users to both UV-A and UV-B rays, which cause skin damage and can cause cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Indoor tanning can be particularly dangerous for young users; research has shown that those who begin tanning before age 35 have a 75% higher risk of melanoma. The American Suntanning Association, however, criticized the new law, saying it would only drive teens to ""riskier alternatives like home units and beaches."" In a statement, the association said it was ""disappointed that Gov. Christie and the New Jersey legislature have decided that government should have more of a say in teenagers' lives than their parents,"" and notes it has ""worked diligently to offer a compromise including stricter regulations, more enforcement and fines and greater parental control.""","New Jersey bans those under 17 from using commercial tanning beds .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's president says comments he made more than two years ago that are being criticized as anti-Semitic were taken out of context, Egypt's official news agency reported Wednesday. President Mohamed Morsy said the statements, made in 2010, were about Israeli aggression against Palestinians in Gaza, not about the Jewish people, according to a statement published in Egypt News. U.S. senators visiting Cairo on Wednesday confronted him about the comments, according to one of the senators. ""In our meeting with President Morsy, we voiced our strong disapproval of statements he made a few years ago that have recently surfaced,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said in a written statement. ""We had a constructive discussion on this subject. We leave it to the president to make any further comments on this matter that he may wish."" The congressional trip also included Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina; Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island; Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York; Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut; and Chris Coons, D-Delaware. The group met with leadership, business and other Egyptian groups. Morsy told the American delegation he is committed to respecting religions, and to the principle of freedom of belief and religious practice. Morsy backs Syrian calls for al-Assad to face war crimes . ""President Morsy also added that it's necessary to separate between Judaism and the Jewish people, and the violent practices against the unarmed Palestinians and the assaults on their lives and properties,"" according to the Egyptian News report. On Tuesday, the Obama administration strongly condemned Morsy's recorded comments and called on him to repudiate what he said. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland called the comments ""deeply offensive ... language that espouses religious hatred."" In the recording, Morsy says Arabs and Muslims ""must cut off all relations with this plundering criminal entity"" and ""besiege the Zionists,"" whom he calls ""bloodsuckers,"" ""warmongers"" and ""descendants of apes and pigs."" ""We want to see President Morsy make absolutely clear to his own people, to the international community that he respects people of all faiths,"" Nuland said on Tuesday. The White House, in a clearly coordinated statement, also condemned Morsy's statements. Spokesman Jay Carney told reporters, ""This kind of discourse has been acceptable in the region for far too long and is counter to the goal of peace. President Morsy should make clear that he respects people of all faiths and that this type of rhetoric is not acceptable or productive in a democratic Egypt."" The comments, which Morsy made as a then-leader of the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, immediately raised questions about whether he can be trusted to respect Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Even as she condemned Morsy's remarks, the State Department spokeswoman noted that since he has been president, Morsy ""has reaffirmed again, and again"" Egypt's commitment to peace with Israel. ""He has been willing to work with us, and with Israel, on shared objectives, including the cease-fire in Gaza,"" Nuland said. ""He's been committed to our bilateral relationship. So ... that is the basis on which we are continuing to work together going forward."" She added, however, ""We will judge him by what he does ... but we'll also judge him by ... what he says. And we think that these comments should be repudiated and they should be repudiated firmly."" Asked whether Morsy's comments could damage relations with the United States, Nuland said U.S. officials hope that making the administration's views clear to the Egyptian leader and inducing him to publicly step away from his comments might tamp down what could be an angry reaction from members of Congress. She told reporters, ""We certainly have made the Egyptians aware that we are continuing to seek economic support funds for Egypt on the Hill, and they are very well aware that these kinds of issues are of concern there, too."" Last autumn, Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, chairwoman of the Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, placed a hold on $450 million in U.S. economic support for Egypt after that nation cracked down on democracy support groups.","Morsy says his ""apes and pigs"" comment was aimed at Israeli aggressors .

"Editor's note: The following article was translated from Spanish to English using Duolingo. (CNN Espanol) -- It's relatively easy to find English, Spanish, French and German courses online. But, what if you want to learn Latin, Silbo Gomero, Mayan or Basque? Or a fictitious language such as Dothraki from ""Game of Thrones"" or Klingon from the ""Star Trek"" saga? Then it gets more complicated. The supply for online language education is dominated by the most frequently spoken languages in the world for obvious reasons: They are the most useful for communication and are therefore in most demand. However, linguistic diversity is a world heritage that's at risk of disappearing. According to studies, 10 languages disappear every year, and this process is accelerating over time. But technology could come to the rescue. Duolingo, the successful language-learning app, has announced the launch of an ""incubator"" that will allow any user to create new courses for different languages. 'Crowdsourcing' to create the courses . Any user? Yes, any user as long as they know the language they want to teach and the language from which it will be taught. For example, if a user knows how to speak Spanish and Latin perfectly, they will be able to create a Latin course for Spanish speakers. Duolingo's plan is to appeal to collective intelligence and ""crowdsourcing"" to recruit an army of volunteers to develop these courses. ""There is only going to be one course for each language; and for each language, we will choose between two and three moderators through an application system and a selection process. Then these moderators can choose teams of people to help them,"" explains Luis von Ahn, the Guatemalan creator of Duolingo and one of the pioneers of crowdsourcing. According to Duolingo, one person working 40 hours per week would require about four months to develop one of these courses, so bringing together a good team will be necessary for the initiative to succeed, something that von Ahn is not concerned about. The task of creating a language course seems to only be within the reach of expert linguists, but the method that Duolingo has developed is ""pretty restricted, with a concrete lists of words and the order in which they must be used, with easy phrases,"" says von Ahn. The language incubator guides the user so they only have to follow a few standardized steps to create any course. The system has a number of consistency algorithms that verify the quality of the courses. Once finished, they start out as beta versions that will improve according to user feedback. If the established learning metrics are not achieved, Duolingo closes the course and invites the moderator to improve it until it is effective. What's the incentive? It seems like creating a course on Duolingo will be hard work, but the company is clear on the fact that it will not pay any of the collaborators who participate. ""Our objective is to teach the world languages for free, so we also expect others to collaborate for free,"" says the creator of Duolingo. At the moment, Duolingo is financed by $18 million of venture capital and with translations that the system generates. The names of the course creators will be displayed, and they will receive all the credit. Will that be enough incentive? Von Ahn, also famous for being one of the inventors of the authentication method known as ReCaptcha, says he had received ""more than a thousand e-mails in the last year and a half from people willing to collaborate."" There are also organizations interested in this new Duolingo tool, among them a foundation in the south of Mexico that wants to develop courses of indigenous languages in the area. Several schools and universities in the world are already using Duolingo to teach languages, and according to estimates from the company, there are close to 30,000 students that follow its method. The Duolingo philosophy . In a short time, Duolingo has become one of the most popular methods for learning languages because it requires only an Internet connection and a smartphone to be immersed in the learning experience. According to Duolingo, which also has apps for iOS and Android, between 60,000 and 70,000 people register to the site every day (there are 10 million total registered users). The app has been downloaded more than six million times in the Android version and more than seven million times in the iOS version for iPhone and iPad, which makes Duolingo the most downloaded educational app in Google Play and iTunes, respectively. The whole philosophy of Duolingo is based on teaching its users about 3,000 basic words of each language, as well as a series of basic structures for expressing ideas in different verb tenses.

"(CNN) -- When Nike signed a multi-million dollar deal to add Rory McIlroy to their ranks they must have salivated at the thought of the world's top player going head-to-head with stablemate Tiger Woods. Imagine the marketing potential of their twin titans battling it out down the stretch at major championships for years to come, bedecked, of course, in Nike gear. That dream may well be realized in time, and Woods at least has one title to his name this year, but at the most high-profile tournament of 2013 to date both crashed and burned at the first hurdle. World No. 1 McIlroy was eliminated in the first round of the World Match Play Championship by Ireland's Shane Lowry in Arizona, to add to his missed cut at his only other appearance this year, in Abu Dhabi. Woods, the world No. 2, didn't fare any better, losing to Charles Howell III. The other two top seeds, South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen and England's Luke Donald, the world No. 3, went safely through to round two. McIlroy squandered early chances against Lowry, who came to life on the back nine, chipping in for birdie at 11 and 12 before an eagle at 13 put him in the driving seat. The Northern Irishman won 16 to reduce the deficit to one shot but Lowry, ranked 68, held firm to sink a four-foot putt at the last to claim a famous triumph. ""I didn't make enough birdies in the end,"" McIlroy told the PGA Tour's official website. ""Shane had a nice little stretch around part of the back nine. I hung in there, but I just didn't do enough."" ""Deep down I knew I could beat him,"" a jubilant Lowry said. ""I'm not here for no reason. I'm not here to make up the numbers. ""I said to Darren, my caddie, walking down 11 or 12, 'He's not liking this one bit. He's the one under pressure, I've got nothing to lose, so let's have a go from here.' ""I'm feeling quite good now, but it's important not to get too high now because it's only the first round, and I've got another match tomorrow."" Heavy snow curtailed the first day and delayed the start on Thursday as the course was prepared for play. And in fading light, Woods and Howell decided to continue playing in near gloom to reach a conclusion. Woods squared the game on 13 but Howell birdied the 15th and 16th to go two up, wrapping the match up on the 17th. Woods was naturally disappointed in defeat but was pleased with his performance. ""I played well, I really did,"" Woods said. ""I hit a lot of good shots out there. ""It's the nature of the format. You've just got to beat the guy you're playing against, and I didn't do that today. Chucky won the match."" Elsewhere, defending champion Hunter Mahan moved into the second round after a comprehensive 5&4 victory over Matteo Manassero. Donald, the 2011 champion, fought hard to beat Germany's Marcel Siem on the final hole while fellow Englishman, and European Ryder Cup hero, Ian Poulter beat Stephen Gallacher 2&1. Graeme McDowell edged a close game with Padraig Harrington, Jim Furyk defeated Ryan Moore while 2012 Masters champion Bubba Watson and 2012 U.S. Open winner Webb Simpson moved into round two. There were other high-profile departures in the form of 2011 U.S. PGA champion Keegan Bradley, Lee Westwood and 2012 British Open winner Ernie Els.","Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy both lose in first round of Match Play Championship .

"(CNN) -- Hispanics in the United States are less likely than whites to access the internet, have a home broadband connection or own a cell phone, according to a study by the Pew Hispanic Center released Wednesday. The study found that differences in educational level and income are likely behind the digital gap, as the divide in most cases disappears when adjusted for those two factors. Latinos also lag behind African-Americans in home broadband access but have similar rates of internet and cell phone use, the study found. While about two-thirds of Hispanic and African-American adults went online in 2010, more than three-fourths of white adults did so, the study found. As for broadband use at home, the gap between Hispanics and whites is significant, the study says. ""The difference in internet use between Hispanics and whites is driven in part by the fact that Hispanics tend to have less education and lower incomes than whites,"" study author Gretchen Livingston wrote. ""When education or income are controlled for, the ethnic differences in internet use disappear."" Educational attainment is also correlated with internet use, according to the study. While only 42% of Latinos without a high school diploma are online, that share increases to 68% for those who have completed high school. And 91% of Latinos who have attended at least some college say that they go online. Household income is also strongly associated with internet use, the study says. In households with incomes under $30,000 a year, some 57% of Hispanics use the internet, the study says. That number jumps up to 79% for Hispanic households that make between $30,000 and $49,999. And more than 90% of Latinos in households with incomes of more than $50,000 are online, the study found. In sum, what the report found was that ""Hispanics and whites who have similar socioeconomic characteristics have similar usage patterns for these technologies."" The report was based on two national surveys. The Pew Hispanic Center's 2010 National Survey of Latinos was a survey of 1,375 adults and had a margin of error of 3.3%. The second survey was the Pew Internet and American Life Project in August 2010, which surveyed 3,010 adults and had a margin of error of 2.5%.","Hispanics are less likely than whites to access the internet or have broadband, study says .

"Qadem Khel, Ghazni province, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The day begins with a count of the necessities for a joint operation with Afghan troops -- among them 85 halal MREs (Meals Ready To Eat). Around the tactical headquarters, soldiers of the 172nd Infantry get a taste of home before setting off into the wilder fringes of lawless Ghazni province. There's baseball televised from Fenway Park, replete with a rendition of the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" by Rose Newton, aged 11. One lieutenant has his mortgage approved by email; another exclaims how he just can't wait to go home. This is FOB ""4 Corners."" And tonight these soldiers plan an air assault into an area called Qadem Khel, where the Taliban is basically the law. Neither this unit, nor other U.S. forces, will get to do many more of these as the drawdown of Allied forces gathers pace. Adding an air of anticipation to the mission, the men at 4 Corners believe two of the men they most want to take off the battlefield are in the area. They have a photo of one of them, with and without a heavy mop of hair. The helicopters arrive and, with the assistance of night vision for the Americans and some careful footwork by their Afghan colleagues, they climb aboard. The helicopters touch down in a huge expanse of desert. The troops huddle in the coldest moment before the dawn, and then begin their approach. The mantra now is ""Afghan-led,"" part of NATO's bid to make this an Afghan-only war. The Afghan soldiers are mostly from the north or northeast of Afghanistan and to many locals they are strangers almost as foreign as the Americans. They lead the way, set the tempo. And, for a mission that many of the Americans thought might have been one for special forces, that tempo is pretty relaxed. In large numbers, in daylight, they amble into town. They're allowed into most homes; would you say ""no"" when four dozen armed men arrive at your door? When they meet a locked door, the Afghans seem to turn away, particularly when a pocket knife can't prise the lock. It is remarkable to watch, and their casual attitude is contagious to the Americans, who are soon also ambling, in between the occasional grimace at how this operation is being led. Soon it becomes clear that their prey has probably fled unless they're remarkably lazy. Sergeant Richard Snader admits that ""once they hear the birds they probably leave immediately."" But still they carry on, house to house, the first contact this village has had with the Afghan government in over six months. At times, it has an almost random feeling. Two boys are caught riding banned motorbikes. One Afghan soldier considers shooting the bike's fuel tank as a punishment, but decides that's probably too dangerous even for him. So the soldiers let the tires down, and then the more sheepish biker is given a couple of heavy slaps around the head. Instant justice, Afghan-army style. Far from western jurisprudence, but in rural Afghanistan, this is often what passes as the law. As they pass through the village, locals seem bemused, friendly. As though visited by aliens, rather than caught in a war. This is not a place where NATO has power, or Afghanistan's government even exists. Captain Chris Barlow says he's been told by locals that when the Taliban lay booby traps for NATO, they issue a warning to villagers over the mosque loudspeakers. This is their form of law. Barlow, with eight weeks left in his tour, accepts it's likely American forces won't return to Qadam Khel soon. Eventually, the insurgency makes an appearance. The Americans are searching a house where weapons had been found previously when shots are fired. There is confusion and the Afghan army seem to relish the fight ahead. U.S. airpower arrives quickly, with one of the heavily armed A10 warplanes buzzing the likely insurgent position. But after 20 minutes, it's clear children and women are near the insurgent firing position. The Americans dispense with any idea of an assault. They head back into the village, and at dark move again -- across wide open fields to the landing zone. A whirr of Chinook blades and a cloud of dust later, the Americans are gone, perhaps for the last time.","American soldiers plan air assault into Afghan area where the Taliban is basically law .

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Dozens of Roman Catholic bishops in South America say human trafficking has seen ""alarming growth"" in the region. The 60 bishops from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay issued a statement after a meeting in Argentina last week, calling the practice ""a shameful and outrageous reality"" and pledging to do more to fight it. ""We warn of the existence of organized mafias that use smaller networks that are present in nearly all of our cities and towns,"" the statement said. Learn more at The CNN Freedom Project . Citing reports from global nonprofit groups, the bishops noted that child sex trafficking rings were also operating in the area. The bishops pledged to raise awareness of the problem, push for legal reforms and assist victims -- noting that within the church there had been ""an absence of proposals dedicated to attracting young people (to the church), and the absence of a more decisive and broad response to the problem (of human trafficking)."" Such an approach is not surprising, said Sergio Rubin, a journalist who has written extensively about the Catholic Church in Argentina. ""The church is assuming its role, and they believe that they must work a lot more in the formation of religious values,"" Rubin said. Mario Ganora, a lawyer who works with La Alameda, an Argentinian nonprofit that helps victims of human trafficking, said the increase in human trafficking was connected to an increase in drug consumption. ""How? ... The women who are used for sex trafficking are also used for the delivery of drugs,"" he said. According to official data from Argentina's Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, 176 people were rescued from human trafficking networks in Argentina in April, a higher number than the entire previous trimester.","Catholic bishops warn of ""organized mafias"" that run trafficking networks .

"(CNN) -- Lebron James has revealed an interest in joining forces with David Beckham to bring a new Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise to Miami. The Miami Heat forward told reporters Monday that preliminary talks were underway with interest from both sides. ""David has become a good friend of mine over the last few years, and I think it would be great for this city to have a football club for sure. There's interest on both sides. It's preliminary talks but there is some open dialogue,"" James said. If a partnership is agreed it would be James's second investment in the sport -- the 28-year-old is already a minority shareholder in English Premier League team Liverpool. ""I've grown a great interest in watching the game ... it's a pretty intense sport and my kids love it as well. I've grown to the point where I know exactly what's going on when I'm watching the game."" Beckham, who retired from the professional football in May, publicly expressed his desire to become a club owner at a book launch last month. Read more: David Beckham 'passionate' about being club owner . ""I'm passionate about staying in football and being an owner of a team is something I'm passionate about. Miami is one of the places we looked at, and we've looked at others too,"" the 38-year-old said. The former England international's groundbreaking contract signed with LA Galaxy in 2007 gave him the option to create a new MLS team for $25 million. ""When I signed my contract six, seven years ago, my manager Simon Fuller actually got a clause in the contract that enabled me to have a franchise at the end of my playing career and obviously now I've stopped playing,"" he said. Beckham and James appear undeterred by the city's previous foray into MLS which saw Miami Fusion close for business in 2002 after only four years in the league. Today, the MLS supports 19 teams with a 20th club -- New York City FC -- set to launch in 2015. James says research into the viability of a franchise is ongoing but he doesn't doubt Miami's potential. ""I think this could be huge, but you never know. I think this is a great town for soccer. There's a lot of soccer players here and great youth soccer players here and people love the city as well so that will definitely help,"" he said. Beckham, as you would expect, was typically enthusiastic when quizzed last month about soccer's long-term prospects in the U.S. ""It's going to get better and bigger,"" said Beckham.

"London (CNN) -- Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"" -- ""the world's most stolen work of art"" -- has gone on display in London ahead of its sale in New York next month, where it is expected to fetch more than $80 million. The work is one of four versions of the same subject created by Norwegian artist Munch (1863 - 1944) in the 1890s -- and the only one still in private hands. Simon Shaw, of Sotheby's in New York where the piece will go under the hammer on May 2, said ""The Scream"" was ""the second most famous work of art in the world, after the 'Mona Lisa.'"" Copies of the painting have appeared on everything from postcards and umbrellas to mousemats. The image inspired Wes Craven's ""Scream"" film franchise, and was referenced in posters for the ""Home Alone"" movies, starring Macaulay Culkin. ""It has a double life,"" Shaw told CNN. ""It is a key image in the history of modern art, but on the other hand, it has also become a cornerstone of popular culture: We all know it from the films and the cartoons, the parodies, the pastiches and the toys. ""What is fascinating for me is that while everybody knows 'The Scream' -- it is one of the most recognizable paintings anywhere -- relatively few people have actually seen the original. What we know are the cartoons and the parodies."" Shaw, head of Impressionist and Modern Art at the auction house, said the picture's status as a high-profile target for thieves had only boosted its popularity. ""Of the four versions, three are in public collections in Oslo, and of those, two have been stolen in the past 20 years,"" he said. ""Happily in each case the work was recovered, but that status as 'the world's most stolen work of art' has only added to its celebrity. ""The thefts got 'The Scream' onto the cover of newspapers and on television around the world, so it became more and more famous. ""When the National Gallery of Norway had its version stolen in 1994, visitor numbers actually went up -- people came from around the world to look at the nail and the empty piece of wall where 'The Scream' was supposed to hang."" The picture -- a vivid pastel, produced in 1895 -- is owned by Petter Olsen, a member of the Olsen shipping dynasty. His father Thomas was a friend and neighbor of Munch, and amassed a large collection of the artist's work. Olsen is selling ""The Scream"" to fund the construction of a museum and arts center, Ramme Gaard, at Hvitsten, Norway, in which he plans to display the rest of his paintings. The new venue is set to open next year, the 150th anniversary of Munch's birth. ""I have lived with this work all my life, and its power and energy have only increased with time,"" said Olsen. ""Now, however, I feel the moment has come to offer the rest of the world a chance to own and appreciate this remarkable work."" Sotheby's says it expects huge interest in the piece, which it says has the potential to draw visitors from around the world to any collection which stumps up the cash to buy it. ""The opportunity for a museum or a private collector to buy one of the great icons of art history is unlikely to be repeated any time soon,"" said Shaw. ""We know there is a lot of demand, and very little supply. It has truly global appeal, and could go anywhere.""","""The Scream"" on display at Sotheby's in London ahead of its sale in New York .

"(CNN) -- You may have heard it before: billions of years ago Mars probably looked more like Earth does now, with clouds and oceans and a much thicker atmosphere. It may even have had some type of microbes. But now it's a barren, frozen desert. So what happened? Where did the air and water go? NASA is launching a new spacecraft to try to find out. It's called MAVEN, which stands for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution. It's the first mission dedicated to studying the red planet's upper atmosphere. ""We expect to learn how the modern Mars works, really in detail. To see its climate state, to understand how the atmosphere is lost to space -- how Mars may have lost a magnetic field -- to take that information and map it back in time, "" said NASA's James Garvin. The earliest liftoff time for MAVEN is Monday, November 18, at 1:28 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket will launch the probe into space on a 10-month trip to Mars. It's scheduled to arrive September 22, 2014. The solar-powered probe is about the length of school bus -- 37.5 feet (11.43 meters) long -- and will weigh about 5,410 pounds (2,454 kg) at launch. What killed Mars? New spacecraft will find out . ""MAVEN will fill in a very big gap in our understanding of the planet by exploring the upper atmosphere and its influence on the Martian environment,"" principal investigator Bruce Jakosky, from the University of Colorado, says on his NASA webpage. He says he's ""excited that we're providing one step along the path of answering questions about whether life ever existed on Mars."" Jakosky's team will use the spacecraft's three instrument suites to try to meet three key objectives: . â€¢ Determine the composition of upper Martian atmosphere . â€¢ Determine how fast Mars is losing what's left of its atmosphere . â€¢ Determine the history of the atmosphere . MAVEN won't make a cool, daring landing like the Mars Curiosity Rover, which has been roaming Mars for more than a year now. Instead, it will orbit between a low of about 93 miles (150 kilometers) above the surface to a high of about 3,728 miles (6,000 kilometers). It also will make five dives, flying as low as 77 miles (125 kilometers) in altitude. NASA says the mission will cost $671 million.

"(CNN) -- Google Chairman Eric Schmidt has been thinking a lot about our digital future. Maybe that's not a big surprise for a man whose company has played a major role in shaping our 21st-century lives, from how we find information to how we use our phones. It's that role, perhaps, that has made Schmidt's new book, ""The New Digital Age: Reshaping the Future of People, Nations and Business,"" so widely anticipated. The book, out Tuesday, is co-written with Jared Cohen, a former U.S. State Department terrorism adviser who now heads up Google Ideas, the company's think tank. In it, the authors consider what our world will be like when everyone on Earth is connected digitally. (Schmidt believes this will happen by the end of the decade). Read: Let's get everyone online ASAP . A universal Web, the authors say, will be an inevitable outcome of a world that's increasingly being driven by technology. But instead of an ominous sci-fi vision of a planet run by robot overlords, they envision a world that will be shaped, for better or worse, by us. ""This is a book about technology, but even more, it's a book about humans and how humans interact with, implement, adapt to and exploit technologies in their environment, now and in the future ...,"" they write. ""For all the possibilities that communication technologies represent, their use for good or ill depends solely on people. Forget all the talk about machines taking over. What happens in the future is up to us."" Here are six predictions Schmidt and Cohen make about the future of the Web: . Online privacy classes will be taught alongside sex education in schools. ""Parents will ... need to be even more involved if they are going to make sure their children do not make mistakes online that could hurt their physical future. As children live significantly faster lives online than their physical maturity allows, most parents will realize that the most valuable way to help their child is to have the privacy-and-security talk even before the sex talk."" Conversely, they say, ""Some parents will deliberately choose unique names or unusually spelled traditional names so that their children have an edge in search results, making them easy to locate and promotable online without much direct competition."" The rise of the mobile Web means the entire world will be online by 2020. ""What might seem like a small jump forward for some -- like a smartphone priced under $20 -- may be as profound for one group as commuting to work in a driverless car is for another,"" they write. ""Mobile phones are transforming how people in the developing world access and use information, and adoption rates are soaring. There are already more than 650 million mobile-phone users in Africa, and close to 3 billion across Asia."" One example they cite of how mobile is already changing lives: Congolese fisherwomen who used to take fish to the market, only to sometimes watch their catch spoil, now leave their fish in the water and wait for calls from customers. News organizations will find themselves out of the breaking-news business, as it becomes impossible to keep up with the real-time nature of information sources like Twitter. ""Every future generation will be able to produce and consume more information than the previous one and people will have little patience or use for media that cannot keep up,"" the authors say. ""News organizations will remain an important and integral part of society in a number of ways, but many outlets will not survive in their current form -- and those that do survive will have adjusted their goals, methods and organizational structure to meet the changing demands of the new global public."" Online ""cloud"" data storage will continue to emerge as the norm, and that's going to radically change how we view privacy. ""The possibility that one's personal content will be published and become known one day -- either by mistake or through criminal interference -- will always exist. People will be held responsible for their virtual associations, past and present, which raises the risk for nearly everyone since people's online networks tend to be larger and more diffuse than their physical ones,"" they write. ""Since information wants to be free, don't write anything down you don't want read back to you in court or printed on the front page of a newspaper, as the saying goes. In the future, this adage will broaden to include not just what you say and write, but the websites you visit, who you include in your online network, what you 'like,' and what others who are connected to you say and share."" As the Web expands, revolutions will begin springing up in nations with oppressive governments ""more casually and more often than at any other time in history."" ""With new access to virtual space and to its technologies, populations and groups all around the world will seize their moment, addressing long-held grievances or new concerns with tenacity and conviction. Many leading these charges will be young, not just because so many of the countries coming online have incredibly young populations ... but also because the mix of activism and arrogance in young people is universal."" More people will use technology for terror. But a Web presence will make those terrorists easier to find, too. ""Many of the populations coming online in the next decade are very young and live in restive areas, with limited economic opportunities and long histories of internal and external strife. ... Terrorism, of course, will never disappear, and it will continue to have a destructive impact,"" the authors write. ""But as the terrorists of the future are forced to live in both the physical and the virtual world, their model of secrecy and discretion will suffer. There will be more digital eyes watching, more recorded interactions, and, as careful as even the most sophisticated terrorists are, even they cannot completely hide online.""","In new book, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt says Web will be everywhere soon .

"(CNN) -- American military aircraft will fly African and European peacekeepers to the Central African Republic, which is in the midst of a bloody internal conflict between various proclaimed Christian and Muslim militias and other rebel factions. The decision announced the Pentagon was followed by a statement from President Barack Obama, who called on the country's citizens to reject violence and urged the transitional government to join ""respected leaders"" in Muslim and Christian communities in calling for ""calm and peace."" ""Individuals who are engaging in violence must be held accountable in accordance with the law. Meanwhile, as forces from other African countries and France work to restore security, the United States will support their efforts to protect civilians,"" Obama said. Pentagon spokesman Carl Woog said ""the United States is joining the international community"" in aiding the peackeeping effort ""because of our belief that immediate action is required to avert a humanitarian and human rights catastrophe."" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel responded after talking with his French counterpart, Yves Le Drian, on Sunday from Afghanistan, Woog said, adding that France asked for ""limited assistance."" The request for near term help involves U.S. air support to enable the prompt deployment of African forces ""to prevent the further spread of sectarian violence,"" Woog said. Violence has raged in the former French colony east of Cameroon since a coalition of rebels deposed President Francois Bozize in March. It was the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence. Bozize fled the country after his ouster. Left uncontrolled, militia groups are uniting along religious lines. Christian vigilante groups have formed to battle Seleka, the predominantly Muslim coalition behind the President's removal. More than 400,000 people -- nearly 10% of the population -- have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations. The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a resolution last week authorizing military intervention by an African Union-led force backed by French troops to protect civilians, restore humanitarian access and stabilize the country. As part of the effort, the United States will fly troops from Burundi to the Central African Republic capital of Bangui. The Pentagon will provide security for its planes, but there is no indication about the number of troops involved. The operation is expected to be relatively small. Violence on the ground, which has included machetes, knives, rifles and grenades, will be a ""big factor"" in any U.S. operation, a U.S. official told CNN. ""It's a concern,"" the official said. French President Francois Hollande said in Paris over the weekend that the goal is to hold elections once security is restored. Hollande will visit the Central African Republic on Tuesday, his office said, after he first attends the memorial service for former South African leader Nelson Mandela. No time was specified. Those displaced include people hiding in the bush without shelter, food, or drinking water, Doctors Without Borders has said. In a statement on Monday, the international medical organization called for all parties to let the wounded and sick ""safely obtain medical care,"" and for ""an end to violence and threats against patients, civilians, and medical staff"" nationwide.

"(CNN) -- As the more than 76 million babies born in the ""Baby Boom"" of 1946 to 1964 approach and enter retirement, many thought they would finally be driving across the country in that decked out RV or spending more time spoiling the grandkids. However, with their parents living longer than ever, many boomers have learned that unexpected obligations can cause their retirement plans to veer off-course. According to data from the National Alliance for Caregiving, an estimated 65 million people in the U.S. are unpaid family caregivers. Seven in 10 of those caregivers take care of someone 50 years of age or older, according to research done in conjunction with the AARP. Caregiving for loved ones the 'new normal' for boomers . Sixty-one-year-old Karen Jones from Virginia Beach, Virginia, burns the candle at both those ends. ""I never thought I would be doing this,"" said Jones. The retiree takes care of both her elderly parents, who are in their 90s and live two houses down from her. At this point in Jones' life, her previous retirement fantasies of traveling have been replaced with the reality of being a caregiver and on call, 24/7. ""Travel plans now include very expensive trip insurance so I can rush back to take care of them,"" said the active retiree, who still surfs. ""An extended trip to Scotland to visit my husband's relatives has been put off twice because it's hard to leave my parents for a month at a time."" Citing a strained relationship with her parents and no siblings nearby, Jones felt compelled to assume the caregiving role, ""knowing that I am doing the right thing and that I am cleaning up my karma and putting old hurts to right,"" she said. Many take this route instead of hiring a third party because it gives not only the child but the parent peace of mind, says Ellen Breslau, editor-in-chief and senior vice president of Grandparents.com. ""They will naturally feel more comfortable with you than with non-family members, which can impact the caregiving and their well-being,"" said Breslau. Chrissy Carew's late mother moved in with her family in Nashua, New Hampshire, in spring 2003. ""When I was a child I always told my parents, when one of you goes, I am going to take care of the other one. I always knew this was my role,"" she said. According to experts, boomers in the caregiving role encounter their own set of unique challenges, physically and emotionally. ""Caregiving often involves physically lifting your parent, helping them walk, sit and do everyday functions like getting dressed. This can have a big impact on your own body, which might not be as strong as it once was,"" said Breslau. Seventeen percent of caregivers felt their health has gotten worse as a result of caregiving, according to the National Alliance for Caregiving. The Family Caregiver Alliance estimates that 30% to 59% of caregivers have symptoms of depression, which can lead to more health problems. Building relationships amid memory loss . ""My age wasn't my concern. My biggest concern was I was exhausted. In the last few months of my mother's life, I moved into her room and didn't get more than two hours of sleep in a row,"" said 59-year-old Carew. There's also the loss of freedom: About half of caregivers say that their caregiving takes time away from friends and other family members. ""When my parents were my age, their parents were dead and they were having fun white-water rafting down the Snake River and here I sit -- two houses down,"" said Jones. There are also the typical difficulties of caregiving that people face, regardless of birth year: balancing work and dealing with the financial burden, among them. According to a 2011 AARP Public Policy Institute study, the estimated economic value of unpaid caregivers was approximately $450 billion. While the burden of caring for elderly parents can be great, experts like Breslau say the benefits can be equally powerful. Looking after a parent allows you to get to know them better. You are often able to spend more quality time together, talking and learning from one another. You can ask them the questions you've always wanted to ask, and hear stories of their life. It is an excellent time to learn your family history and record it, Breslau said. ""It is also a time to give back to your parents in a way that is unique,"" she said. ""They raised you and cared for you, and now the cycle has come full circle to a point where you can do the same for them."" Caregivers like Carew couldn't agree more. ""Bottom line is, loving and caring for my mother was spiritual and the deepest level of fulfillment I have ever known,"" she said. ""What is really cool is that I believe that connection we have will continue to grow and there are deeper levels of fulfillment to come."" ""I am the luckiest daughter alive.""

"(CNN) -- CNN's Freedom Project has broken new ground by exposing the horrors of child labor, the shame of forced marriages, the brutality of child militias and the injustice of the routine everyday discrimination practised against millions of girls, denied even the most basic of education -- most blatantly revealed in the shooting by the Taliban of Malala Yousafzai. This year I foresee the Freedom Project gaining new momentum as young people take to the streets and airwaves, grow more vociferous in championing their rights and prove that they are more assertive in seeking change than the adults tasked with their care. This week a global petition calling for justice for young women in India has attracted more than one million signatures, principally from young people, as a result of the campaigning energies of Avaaz, the global online petitioning movement. Young men and women dominate this month's countrywide anti-rape demonstrations, but all across Asia young people have hit the streets in record numbers at the start of the year. In Bangladesh, young people are leading a movement to demand ""child marriage-free zones"" to end the practice of girls aged 10, 11 and 12 being forced into loveless marriages against their will. I have met some of these brave girls who are proving more determined in standing up against child marriage than their parents. Desmond Tutu: Time for men to challenge treatment of women . In Nepal, days before India's anti-rape protests, young people were already marching, demanding an end to men's violence against women and last week demonstrators voiced their outrage at a tense meeting with the prime minister. In India, another set of street demonstrations is also gaining ground. Young people who have escaped, often when just eight or nine, from bonded labor, have been leading a march to end this form of child slavery, a march that the Chief Justice of India joined and endorsed. And in Burma (also known as Myanmar), where Aung San Suu Kyi led demonstrations for democratic rights 25 years ago, 200,000 young people demonstrated against child trafficking. Already in response to worldwide revulsion at violence against women, major demonstrations are being organized in Africa and Asia in February. These demonstrations build on the role played by young people in the Arab Spring, the growth of an ""indignant"" youth movement in Spain and the student demonstrations about tuition fees and rights to study that have characterized countries as diverse as Canada and China, all of which have focused on the dearth of opportunities for young people. By the end of January, three million people will have signed the Malala petitions, calling for girls to be given their rightful opportunities to go to school. But what is most noteworthy is that one million of these signatures are being assembled by young Pakistani children who are denied a place in school. When I visited Pakistan recently, I was struck by the determination of schoolgirls Kainat and Shazia, friends of Malala who were also injured in the Taliban attack. Both girls determined, in spite of the dangers, to stand up to the intimidation, return to school and study to be doctors. Dictating daughters' destinies . The same determination is displayed by Imran, a young Indian from Bihar who wishes to return to school and train to become a teacher. Promised a chance to send home money to his family, he was forced to work unpaid in a sweatshop for 14 hours a day. Thankfully Imran was rescued by the Global March Against Child Labour. Now his cause, and that of thousands of others like him, will lead to the presentation of a petition to the Indian parliament calling for the abolition of child labor. Indeed it is expected that in advance of the Indian parliament's vote on the issues, one million more mainly young people will add their names. The act of creating ""child marriage-free zones"" reminds us that even in 2013 patriarchs still attempt to dictate their daughters' destinies. The zones also demonstrate patriarchy will not hold back girls' aspirations forever. Protests against male violence against women remind us that too many men still treat women as their chattels, to be exploited and brutalized, but the scale of protests illustrates that the men who are violating rights are being challenged. The demand from girls to go to school is also a reminder that for most of history, adult generations have been able to dictate whether the next generation is free to dream of better futures or not. Now, girls are saying that their elders can no longer trample upon their rights. You don't need to fall for a technological determinism to understand that the Internet is helping to radicalize a new generation of young people thanks to our new-found capacity to communicate instantaneously across continents. Just as opinions during the Arab Spring spread rapidly via new technologies, so young people in Asia are today communicating, exchanging views and learning more about other young people. They are making connections across old borders, breaking down traditional barriers, crossing ancient divides and smashing long-established walls of prejudice. 'Frightened' India child bride annuls marriage . In the 1960s John Kennedy talked of crossing a new frontier. In 2013, because of the advances of technology, young people are finding that there is no frontier. Indeed the sheer scale of the anti-child slavery demonstration of 200,000 young people in Rangoon shows that regimes can repress for a time but they cannot maintain their repression indefinitely. The marches against child trafficking show that the truth will eventually come out and the victims' cries for help will not be silenced forever. It is not technology however that is driving young people's concerns, it is the yawning gap between the promise of globalization and its reality that brings young people out on to the streets. The promise is that every young person has the chance to rise as far as their talents can take them. Young people are, however, coming to understand the reality of globalization -- that their opportunities and rights depend more on where they were born and who they were born to than on their merit, their effort or their talent. It is this growing awareness of the gap between what you have in yourself to become -- and yet what you are -- that is fueling the demand for change. Our task is to offer a pathway out of exploitation and into freedom, out of exclusion and into education. When as much as 80% of global inequality is explained by birth and background, education should be the counterweight, the driver of equal opportunity. The case for global investment in basic education (we need at least two million more teachers and four million classrooms) is not just that individuals will benefit from educational opportunity but that countries will too. Indeed, mobilizing the talent of young people is the only sure way of unlocking the potential of the poorest countries in the world. We spend 250 times more in the West schooling a child up to the age of 16 than we do on the average African child. Our pattern of educational spending compounds rather than corrects or compensates for these glaring inequalities. Annual educational aid is only $14 per African child. An April summit, led by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and World Bank President Jim Kim, will demand concrete action from off-track countries to move children from the violation of their basic rights to the guarantee of their right to education. In the coming year I hope the U.N. will hold a debate in its General Assembly on systematic violations of children's rights, demanding that, instead of the exploitation these young people suffer today, we open the doors to opportunity in education. My aim for 2013 and beyond is to move millions of children from the abyss of exploitation today into the opportunity of education tomorrow. This is the one way we can not only release children from abuse but break the cycle of poverty which is at risk of being transmitted from generation to generation.","Gordon Brown says 2013 already being defined by young people prepared to demonstrate for rights .

"(CNN) -- A man caught on camera beating a woman in front of her child has pleaded not guilty to first-degree attempted murder, Essex County prosecutors say. Shawn Custis, 42, allegedly forced his way into a Millburn, New Jersey, home around 10 a.m. on June 21 and brutally beat the woman while her child sat motionless on a nearby couch. He fled the house with an undetermined amount of jewelry, Millburn police said. The entire episode was caught on the family's home security camera. Custis is also charged with first-degree robbery, second-degree burglary and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, said Katherine Carter, a spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. In the home video obtained by CNN affiliate WABC, Custis repeatedly punches the woman in the face while her child watches nearby. He throws her to the floor, chokes her, kicks her multiple times and throws her down a flight of stairs. He does not hurt the child. After he leaves, the woman goes upstairs to retrieve another child and waits with her two children for police to arrive. The woman who was beaten told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey that she made a conscious decision to try to remain silent in an attempt to protect her daughter. ""I knew that if I started screaming, my daughter would too, and I was afraid that she would get hurt. I took it. I didn't cry the entire time,"" she said. The woman was later taken to an area hospital, where she was treated for injuries to her face and legs, police said. Custis was arrested Friday in New York City by the FBI Fugitive Task Force and detectives from the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. He was taken to the Essex County Detention Center, where he remained until his arraignment Tuesday. CNN's attempts to reach an attorney representing Custis were unsuccessful. Millburn is a small suburban community about 10 miles west of Newark. No court date has yet been set, Carter said.","Shawn Custis, 42, is accused of forcing his way into home, taking jewelry .

"(CNN) -- A judge set bond at $2 million Thursday for a 35-year-old woman who faces charges in the case of a woman whose baby was ripped from her womb. Darlene Haynes, pictured with one of her other children, was found slain in her apartment closet, authorities said. Investigators detained Julie A. Corey on Wednesday afternoon and charged her with being a fugitive from justice. They found her with a newborn in Plymouth, New Hampshire, during an investigation into the death of 23-year-old Darlene Haynes, whose body was found Monday in the closet of her home in Worcester, Massachusetts. Haynes was eight months pregnant. Haynes was last seen July 23, and police suspect she had been dead for several days when her body was discovered, wrapped in bedding.  Watch neighbors describe victim » . A friend told CNN affiliate WHDH that she received a text message from Haynes at 11:20 p.m. July 23 that said she was having wine coolers with a friend at her apartment. Officers received tips from women who became suspicious of another friend of Haynes' who turned up with a newborn girl when Haynes disappeared. Worcester police said they learned that ""a woman connected with Ms. Haynes"" told her acquaintances she had delivered a baby sometime during the night of July 23 or morning of July 24 at an undisclosed Massachusetts hospital. ""When the woman appeared with the newborn baby girl in Worcester on Friday, July 24, the suspicions of a number of this woman's acquaintances were piqued. In the aftermath of the discovery of Ms. Haynes' body and the information that her fetus was missing was reported in the media, several of these acquaintances advised detectives of their suspicions,"" the police statement said. Police sought and found Corey and determined she and a man had moved to New Hampshire, the statement said. The two were brought in for questioning and Corey was arrested on suspicion of being a fugitive from justice. ""This charge is supported by probable cause developed by the Worcester Police Department alleging the kidnapping of the infant child found in the custody of Julie Corey,"" the Worcester police statement said. The baby was determined to be a few days old, said Michele Hutchins, spokeswoman for Speare Memorial Hospital in Plymouth. ""She is in good condition and doing just fine,"" Hutchins said. Hospital officials are expecting to transfer her custody to Massachusetts child welfare workers. ""As the story began to unfold more over the last 24 hours, and then of course with the arrest of someone here in Plymouth tied to that, and then subsequently a baby coming into our hospital, a lot of people are certainly touched and hoping for the best,"" Hutchins said. During an arraignment Thursday, Corey did not waive extradition to Massachusetts. She is scheduled to appear in court again on August 31.

"(CNN) -- Arsenal returned to the top of the English Premier League Thursday as previous leaders Liverpool slipped to fourth with a 2-1 defeat at fellow title challengers Manchester City. A full Boxing Day EPL program saw a pair of Theo Walcott goals help Arsenal to a 3-1 win at struggling West Ham before Liverpool became the latest side to find City in unbeatable form at fortress Etihad Stadium. The late kick off was a hard-fought affair and Liverpool took a 24th minute lead as Philippe Coutinho scored after Raheem Sterling beat the offside trap from a Luis Suarez pass. Liverpool continued to make the running, but City equalized after 31 minutes when Vincent Kompany headed home from a corner. Alvaro Negredo put the home side ahead on the stroke of halftime as his shot found its way past visiting goalkeeper Simon Mignolet following good work from Samir Nasri and Jesus Navas. The second half saw chances for both title contenders, with Sterling missing the chance to level when he blazed over from a Suarez assist. City leapfrogged Liverpool to move up to second and remain the favorite with most bookmakers to claim the title. But earlier Arsenal returned to winning ways in timely fashion to beat West Ham at Upton Park. Carlton Cole put West Ham ahead just after halftime before Walcott leveled with the first of his double inside three minutes. German international Podolski set the seal on an excellent day for the Gunners by scoring after coming off the bench. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger praised the spirit of his league leaders after claiming the vital three points. ""We couldn't take our chances in the first half and we responded very well in second half, in the end winning the game in a convincing way,"" he told the Press Association. ""I am proud of the character of this team because they are always focused and try to do well."" Jose Mourinho's Chelsea also remained in the hunt in third place -- two points behind Arsenal -- with a 1-0 home win over Swansea. Eden Hazard scored the only goal of the game in the first half, but Mourinho was left frustrated by their inability to press home their advantage. ""They kill me. Every game I'm tired in the end,"" he said. ""At halftime we all should be relaxed with a comfortable result and we weren't."" Everton's challenge faltered with a 1-0 home defeat to Sunderland as all three bottom sides at the start of the day secured surprise away wins. Crystal Palace beat Aston Villa 1-0 and Fulham overcame Norwich 2-1 with former England international Scott Parker grabbing the winner. Parker's former team Tottenham Hotspur were held to a disappointing 1-1 home draw by West Bromwich Albion in the first game since Tim Sherwood was confirmed as manager. Newcastle secured a seventh win in nine games against nine-man Stoke, who had Glenn Whelan and Marc Wilson sent off in the first half. Oussama Assaidi had put Stoke ahead but two men short they were always struggling and Loic Remy scored twice as well as missing a first half penalty. Cardiff fans protested against owner Vincent Tan before their side's 3-0 home defeat to Southampton, which leaves manager Malky Mackay's future in more doubt. Jay Rodriguez scored twice for the Saints with fellow England international Rickie Lambert getting the other.","Manchester City beat Liverpool in top of table clash .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Geronimo was a beautiful painted quarter horse. Geronimo ""was irreplaceable,"" says the woman who owned him. ""He was a type of horse that he got along with everybody,"" says owner Ivonne Rodriguez. She had Geronimo for five years -- until his slaughtered carcass was found under a tree. For Geronimo, home was a 10-acre pasture in a rural area of Miami-Dade County. The horse, Rodriguez says, made many people happy over the years. ""He was ridden by everybody,"" she says. ""He was irreplaceable."" Geronimo had a distinct look -- brown and white, with a thick white stripe that ran from his forehead to his nose. It was this mark that helped a neighbor identify Geronimo after he was reported missing. Someone is killing horses in Southeast Florida. Since January, 19 horses have been reported butchered -- 17 in Miami-Dade County and two in Broward County. And that might be just a conservative estimate. ""That number is extremely low,"" says Richard ""Kudo"" Couto of the South Florida Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""There are many more slaughters in South Florida."" Couto, an SPCA investigator, says many butcherings are going unreported by people who do not want to get involved with law enforcement. Police concede that underreporting of such animal cruelty crimes is a concern. The reported deaths are being investigated by a multiagency team that includes Scott Andress from the Miami-Dade Police Department. ""In the majority of these cases, the carcasses exhibited signs of being slaughtered and dismembered, and the meat removed from the bodies,"" Andress says. Couto says the killing of horses for their meat is South Florida's ""dirty little secret."" But it is a secret no longer, with the number of reported horse deaths on the rise. ""At this point in the investigation, we're attempting to confirm the existence of a black market demand,"" Andress says.  Watch why horse owners are terrified » . Law enforcement authorities say it may be  premature to focus solely on a killing-horses-for-meat theory. But Couto believes that is exactly what is happening And, he says, it has been going on for years. The SPCA's Couto says he knows firsthand that there is a black market for horse meat. He even quotes prices -- a pound of horse meat might sell for anywhere from $7 to $20, with one recent report of $40 for a pound in Broward County. The interest in the meat stems from cultural demand, according to Couto. The Miami area is a melting pot, he says, made up of many nationalities. ""In their country of origin, horse meat is legal to buy and eat,"" Couto explains. He also says people may be interested in horse meat because of a false belief that it will cure medical ailments such as AIDS or ease the side effects of chemotherapy. Andress may not want to pinpoint a motive yet, but he does admit that killing the animals is not the perpetrator's main goal. The goal comes afterward, he explains, with ""whatever activity they engaged in postmortem."" In some instances of the grisly ""activity"" to which Andress refers, the only evidence of a crime is a bare carcass left at the scene. Like Geronimo. ""Not only was my horse stolen, he was butchered,"" Rodriguez says. She believes her beloved horse was tied to a palm tree, and she points out stains that appear to be blood. She thinks he was an easy target. ""Geronimo is a type of horse -- my goodness, if you had an apple in your hand, he's your best friend."" Whoever slaughtered Geronimo concealed the carcass with a tarp and palm fronds. It was found in a rural area near the pasture the animal called home.","SPCA investigator calls horse slaughterings South Florida's ""dirty little secret""

"(CNN) -- Some people like Christmas. Some people love Christmas. And some people are so overcome by their love for the holiday season they decorate homes, gardens, even their vehicles in decorations so spectacular you have to worry about their energy bills. CNN asked people across the world to send in the most stunning and outrageous Christmas displays they had seen. We received submissions from the Dominican Republic to Russia, all of which displayed the inventiveness of people during the holiday season.

""I think the show's significance is to make people feel the excitement and happiness of Christmas in the middle of a busy district,"" he said. ""It brings people together, friends and families."" Meanwhile in the Caribbean, Misael Rincon sent in a series of colorful, Day-Glo shots of Christmas decorations in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. But while the decorations are playful, the sentiment behind them rings true for Misael. ""[Christmas is] a moment to share with family, the arrival of loved ones who are living outside the country,"" he said. ""[It's about] love, faith and hope for the coming of God in a humble manger."" Of course it's not just homes, stores and public spaces that benefit from a sprinkling of tinsel and fairy lights -- many like to deck out their vehicles as well. Paul Tamasi, from Cambridge, Vermont, spotted this decked out truck festooned with lights and couldn't resist taking a quick shot. ""I saw this this truck drive by my restaurant,"" the pizza parlor owner said. ""I jumped in my truck and followed it until I saw it make a stop. My hands got pretty cold capturing it!"" And decorations don't have to be massive to have an effect. Daniel Incandela started collecting quirky Christmas tree ornaments three years ago. A ""Star Wars"" Stormtrooper with a Christmas hat is one of his latest finds to festoon his Christmas tree. ""I have a fair share of decent Christmas decorations that range from Robots to a Harrods Bear to Elvis,"" he said proudly.

"(CNN) -- ISON, the most closely watched comet in recent years, may be falling apart as it nears its close encounter with the sun. Comets are giant snowballs of frozen gases, rock and dust that can be several miles in diameter. When they get near the sun, they warm up and spew out some of the gas and dirt, creating a tail that can stretch for thousands of miles. Most comets are in the outer part of our solar system. When they get close enough for us to see them, scientists study them for clues about how our solar system formed. When ISON was first discovered, hopes were high that it might become visible to the naked eye, meaning everyone might be able see it, not just those with good telescopes who took the trouble to find it. There was talk it might even rival some of the Great Comets like Halley's or Hale-Bopp and spread a huge tail across the sky. But some observers on Tuesday reported online that the comet is not nearly as bright as it has been in recent days and that it may be pouring out dust. This could mean the comet's core, or nucleus, has ""completely disrupted, releasing an enormous volume of dust,"" NASA's Comet ISON Observing Campaign says in its November 25 online update. But other observers say images taken by NASA's STEREO spacecraft are ""encouraging evidence that the comet still exists,"" Padma Yanamandra-Fisher with the ISON campaign told reporters on the campaign's Facebook page. She added that it's too early to tell what kind of shape the comet is in, though. ""I believe the next couple of days will be crucial to determine the post-perihelion appearance of the comet,"" Yanamandra-Fisher said. Perihelion is the point in an object's path that is closest to the sun. 5 things to know about Comet ISON . Whatever its final fate, she said, ISON has ""provided a wonderful window into the world of comets. The full understanding of this comet and its place in the taxonomy of comets will only come in hindsight."" ISON was discovered in September of 2012 by astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok using a telescope near Kislovodsk, Russia, that is part of the International Scientific Optical Network (ISON). ISON -- officially named C/2012 S -- was 585 million miles away at the time. Its amazing journey through the solar system has been chronicled by amateur astronomers and by space telescopes. NASA has even created a toolkit for ISON fans. Confusion about its fate isn't new for ISON watchers. ""From the moment of discovery, ISON has been a confusing, frustrating, dynamic and unpredictable object. In other words, it has been a very typical comet!"" said Karl Battams, an astrophysicist with the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington. The glare of the sun has blocked most ground-based observations, but NASA has a fleet of spacecraft watching as ISON plunges toward the sun. If it hasn't already broken up, it will skim about 730,000 miles above its surface on Thanksgiving Day and could put on a sky show in early December when it moves out of the glare of the sun. The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 26, and, no, it won't hit us. But for now, we wait to learn ISON's fate. ""I am excited at marking the progress of this comet that has captivated the world from its discovery and the possibility of it being a Great Comet,"" Yanamandra-Fisher told CNN.com. ""I am glad that I was able to be part of its journey.""","Comet ISON may or may not be breaking up .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's beleaguered government huddled with various political parties Wednesday, trying to come up with a way forward on an anti-corruption bill as ailing, elderly campaigner Anna Hazare continued his fast for a second day to protest legislation he slammed as too weak to deal with endemic graft. On Tuesday, the national assembly's lower chamber, the Lok Sabha, cleared the bill, aimed at creating a citizen ombudsman called the Lokpal. However, after a marathon session, legislators defeated a key federal motion to accord constitutional powers to the new watchdog. Now, the legislation is expected to be taken up by the upper house of elders, called the Rajya Sabha, where the ruling Congress party does not have a majority. In order for the anti-corruption bill to become a law, it has to be approved by both chambers of the Indian Parliament with a majority vote. ""We are talking to everyone and trying (so) that this bill gets passed in the Rajya Sabha,"" Rajiv Shukla, the country's junior parliamentary affairs minister, told reporters Wednesday. It is not immediately clear though when the bill will be debated in the upper chamber in the current, extended sitting of Parliament. Meantime, a leading constitutional analyst feared that the legislation, even if it is passed into law, would become vulnerable to legal challenges for reserving slots for religious minorities in the proposed institution. ""The (Indian) constitution allows no religion-based quotas,"" noted Subhash Kashyap, a constitutional expert. Slots in government establishments are only reserved for lower-castes, he said. ""This bill is more political than a serious attempt to fight corruption,"" Kashyap said. Several political parties, including the Congress party, are trying to woo Muslim minority groups ahead of upcoming state elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh province, where the community forms a sizeable voting bloc, he explained. Family scion Rahul Gandhi, son of Sonia Gandhi -- the Italian-born head of the Congress party -- had earlier this year suggested a constitutional designation for the Lokpal to protect it from being dismantled by ordinary laws in the future. ""Huge slap on govt (government)'s face"" read a stinging headline on the Pioneer newspaper Wednesday, referring to the failed attempt at securing parliamentary approval for a constitutional status to the ombudsman. ""Lokpal bill passes, statute change fails,"" said a bold header on the Asian Age daily. Meanwhile, Hazare, who brought the corruption issue to the fore, fell ill while keeping up his hunger strike. Doctors warned him to end his fast as did his supporters, while ambulances stood by at the Mumbai commercial complex where the elderly crusader was staging his protest, his third this year. In his remarks Tuesday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh defended his government's bill stoutly. ""There are some very special moments in the life of a nation. This is one such moment,"" Singh said during the Lok Sabha debate. ""Others can persuade and have their voices heard,"" he said, alluding to Hazare. ""But the decision must rest with us. ... We have seen how public anger has manifested itself in the last one year. Let us, therefore, endorse this bill as proposed."" But opposition leaders said Singh was leading a corrupt party -- Congress's reputation has been marred by scandals -- that had put forth a weak anti-graft bill. In a new Transparency International survey published last week, 64% of Indians said they had paid a bribe to police, the highest corruption rate of any institution. And less than a quarter of those surveyed thought their government's efforts to fight corruption were effective. One point of contention in the proposed legislation is that it excludes the Central Bureau of Investigation or federal police from the purview of the Lokpal. ""Without an investigative agency, what is the purpose of Lokpal?"" Hazare said in a December 17 letter. ""It's better we don't have such a Lokpal."" Corruption has been a part of daily life in India for many years. But it was a series of high-profile scandals that rocked the current administration and investor confidence in Asia's third-largest economy. In April, a former government minister was among a dozen defendants charged in a multibillion-dollar telecom scandal. Andimuthu Raja, a former telecommunication minister, is accused of being involved in a scheme involving the underselling of cell phone licenses at the height of India's lucrative telecom boom. Police have questioned several high-profile executives in connection with the suspected below-price sale of radiowaves or broadcast spectrum in 2008. Politicians, bureaucrats, and corporate officials linked to the probe have denied any wrongdoing. Investigators also probed complaints of financial malfeasance in the Commonwealth Games that India hosted in October last year. Several politicians, military officials, and bureaucrats have also been the subjects of a separate inquiry for allegedly taking apartments meant for war widows.","Ailing campaigner continues his hunger strike .

News of the change to the so-called ""drum major"" line was first reported Friday afternoon in the Washington Post. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has given the National Park Service 30 days to consult with the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation, members of the King family and others to decide on a more accurate version of the quote, the official said. The quote holds a prominent place among more than a dozen King's most notable lines at the site. The memorial site features a commanding 30-foot statue of King, arms folded across his chest, emerging from a ""Stone of Hope."" The quote in question is inscribed on one side of the stone. The abbreviated and paraphrased version of the line sparked controversy last summer when acclaimed poet and author Maya Angelou said it made the civil rights leader appear to be arrogant. The line reads: ""I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness."" In fact, King's original words, from a 1968 sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, were: ""If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter."" Angelou said that leaving out the ""if"" changes the meaning. In an interview in October, Martin Luther King III said the quote would be changed, but did not elaborate. ""It's going to be corrected. First of all is what we understand. But I don't know exactly how it got to that place. That was not -- number one, that was not what dad said,"" he told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield. ""The issue is addressed, because it's going to be corrected."" Now the Interior Department is taking action. The MLK memorial sits on the Tidal Basin between the Lincoln Memorial and the Thomas Jefferson Memorial. The ""drum major"" quote was not the only point of contention when it came to the monument, which was more than two decades in the making. Some criticized the foundation for choosing a Chinese sculptor, Lei Yixin, to carve the statue. Others believe it does not accurately depict the civil rights icon. Martin Luther King Jr. Day will be observed across the country Monday. Dozens of students from an elementary school in Washington took turns Friday reciting King's ""'I Have A Dream"" speech. ""We are humbled to be here today in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the enduring legacy of his vision for a nation united by respect, integrity and justice,"" said Watkins Elementary School assistant principal Suriya Douglas Williams. ""Our fifth-graders have studied and prepared diligently to share Dr. King's message with you, a message which still resonates today, nearly five decades after he first delivered it."" CNN's Greg Clary contributed to this report.","Inscription on King memorial in Washington to be corrected .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The leader of a promising rock band, Lights Over Paris, allegedly funded his ""lavish lifestyle"" of travel and a luxury bus by submitting false documents for millions of dollars in bank loans, prosecutors said Friday. Robert Brandon Mawhinney, whose stage name is Robb ""TaLLLLL"" University, has been ordered held without bond because he was deemed a flight risk by U.S. Magistrate Judge Charles F. Eick in Los Angeles, prosecutors said. Mawhinney, whose 30th birthday was Friday, travels abroad frequently and has sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to Cyprus, said spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's Office. Mawhinney, who appeared in federal court on Thursday, was arrested earlier this month at Miami International Airport after he returned from Buenos Aires, prosecutors said. Mawhinney is charged with making a false statement in a loan application, authorities said. He allegedly applied for loans by submitting phony brokerage statements showing he had almost $9 million in assets, but the real statements showed less than $10,000 in the brokerage accounts, authorities said. His attorney wasn't available for comment Friday. A Comerica loan officer and her supervisor visited Mawhinney in a Burbank, California, studio to assess his creditworthiness, and Mawhinney falsely told them he owned the studio with friends Jason and Matthew Salazar, court papers said. Those two friends are brothers who owned the studio, and they were charged Thursday with conspiracy to commit loan fraud, authorities said. The brothers are planning to plead guilty, according to their attorney and prosecutors. Mawhinney told the bank representatives that he was a successful ghostwriter for various artists, the documents said. He protrayed the studio as a side business and said his real passion was writing music, court papers said. Mawhinney needed the loan for equipment purchases and finishing the recording room in his studio, court documents said. The bank representatives told him they would need his tax returns and financial statements, court papers said. Mawhinney is accused of falsely stating he had $9 million in a Charles Schwab savings/brokerage account in May 2010, court papers said. ""At the center of this case are the false documents (such as the Charles Schwab brokerage statements) that the defendant gave to the banks to frustrate their efforts to verify that he was credit-worthy, that there was sufficient collateral for the loans,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Ranee A. Katzenstein told CNN in an e-mail. In August 2011, Mawhinney left a voice mail for the bank loan officer saying he would take care of his outstanding loan payments, but he was in a lot of pain and on heavy medication after having been in a car accident, court papers said. Mawhinney's tax returns showed a Culver City, California, certified public accountant as having prepared the returns, but the CPA told authorities he never heard of Mawhinney, court papers said. Lights Over Paris was deemed an up-and-coming band by Billboard.com in August 2010, when it ranked its ""Turn Off the Lights"" album at No. 6 on the ""heatseekers albums"" chart, which is composed of top-selling albums by new or developing acts. The band describes itself on its website as ""a mix of melodic rock hooks with pulsating dance rhythms and a taste of hip hop."" ""Their headlining 52-city 'Turn Off The Lights' tour electrified audiences and inspired new fans with their unrivaled style and eclectic approach,"" the band's website says. Mawhinney allegedly obtained four loans amounting to $6.25 million from Comerica Bank and then defaulted, prosecutors said. The bank lost about $6 million, authorities said. JP Morgan Chase, Zions Bank and Bank of America also lost money on loans to Mawhinney, prosecutors said. Mawhinney used the loans ""to pay for travel, entertainment and a luxury tour bus that cost well over $750,000,"" the prosecutor's office said. If convicted, Mawhinney faces up to 30 years in prison. He will be arraigned February 11. He lives in the luxury WaterMarke Tower in downtown Los Angeles, authorities said. In the related case involving Mawhinney's two associates, Matthew Salazar, 29, of Valley Village, California, and his brother, Jason Salazar, 28, who has California addresses in Grover Beach and Fresno, have agreed to plead guilty, authorities said. The brothers own Matt Salazar Recording Productions of Burbank, California, and are part owners of LA Sound Gallery, also in Burbank, authorities said. ""They admitted in court documents that they provided false documents to Bank of America, Greystone Bank and Huntington National Bank to obtain about $1.7 million in loans for their music business,"" the prosecutor's office said. If they plead guilty, each brother would face up to five years in federal prison, the prosecutor's office said. Their Los Angeles attorney, Mark Werksman, said the brothers have been cooperating with federal investigators and will enter guilty pleas ""sometime in the near future."" ""They committed these offenses at the direction of Mr. Mawhinney,"" Werksman said.","NEW: Band leader told bank loan officers he was a successful music ghostwriter .

"(CNN) -- Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano rumbled Saturday with explosions and expulsions of ash and gas, prompting authorities to bar people from getting close to a crater that is within sight of Mexico City and many of its 19 million residents. The country's National Center for Disaster Prevention reported that -- following 12 ""low-intensity"" emissions of a small amount of water vapor and gas -- there was ""an exhalation with some explosive component"" around 9 a.m. (10 a.m. ET). This was ""followed by a spasmodic tremor ... with moderate to large amplitudes, which has been accompanied by a continuous emission of ... ash and water vapor,"" according to the government agency. At that time, the emissions had gone at most 400 meters (1,300 feet) above Popocatepetl's crater. Ash had fallen on the towns of San Nicolas de los Ranchos and Huejotzingo, as well as the northern part of the city of Puebla. As the day wore on, the volcanic material soared even higher. An updated government report at 2 p.m. -- three hours after the first one went out -- indicated that ash, steam and gas were spewing an average of 500 meters up into the sky. Mexican authorities restricted access within 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) of the volcano. Located in a national park southeast of Mexico City, Popocatepetl can be seen from there on a clear day. It is one of Mexico's highest peaks and last had a major eruption in 2000. But there have been rumblings since then. Last April, for instance, scientists observed a continuous column of water vapor and moderate amounts of ash rising from the crater.","Ash and water vapor soar above Mexico's Popocatepetl crater .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- After awaiting reforms that may or may not come, thousands of young undocumented immigrants have abandoned their American Dream voluntarily or because they were deported. They still consider themselves DREAMers, but now they dream in Mexico. ""I returned (to Mexico) because in the U.S. I always wanted to study dentistry. When I graduated from college, I ran into the problem that my great hope, the DREAM Act, still had not been approved,"" said Pedro Hernandez, who lived in Los Angeles for eight years. The DREAM Act -- Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors -- would remove a roadblock to education and a future in the United States for such youths. Undocumented immigrant youths have the right to study through high school. After that, they can study at private universities -- with high costs and without access to student loans -- or in public universities -- most of which charge them tuition at an ""out-of-state"" rate, which can be double what in-state students pay. Only some states have laws allowing undocumented students to attend state universities at in-state rates. Those who manage to graduate tend to find job offers for unskilled workers, offering low wages. ""I think I returned because I know that my parents left to give us a better education, and while I was there, I felt that all of that effort was for naught if I worked as a florist, caring for someone's baby or working at a butcher shop"" 27-year-old Maru Ponce said. She immigrated to New York when she was 8 years old. Now she works in the Mexican capital as a sales operation analyst for a company and dreams of doing graduate studies in the same area. In general, undocumented immigrants in the United States cannot get a driver's license or credit cards, and cannot travel freely in the country. ""I couldn't move around like I wanted, and to go to school I had to drive with fear,"" said Moises Zarco, 27. Originally from Mexico's east-central state of Hidalgo, Zarco lived in Georgia for eight years. Six states recently approved laws that allow the undocumented to have driver's licenses. ""Everything seems nice on the surface, but you don't really belong to that place and you're never going to be American even if you have your papers,"" said Samantha Hernandez, who voluntarily returned to her city, Tijuana. Between 2005 and 2010, more than 1.4 million Mexicans returned to their country after living in the United States, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. It is estimated that more than 400,000 of those who returned in the past decade were youths, according to a government-supported survey. In June 2012, President Barack Obama instituted a policy of deferred action that granted lawful status to undocumented youths who had arrived before their 16th birthdays, were in school or graduated, and had no major criminal records. The impact of returning . Only 5% to 35% of those who returned to Mexico during the past five years and remained there did not go back voluntarily, the Pew Hispanic Center estimates. The range is wide because ""data on who is sent back and what happens to them are sketchy,"" it says on its website. The majority had experienced a lack of educational and job opportunities, and increases in anti-immigrant policies, the center says, citing government data from both countries. In Zarco's case, police stopped him on the state line between Georgia and Florida, and he was detained for being in the country illegally. He spent three months in a detention center in Miami and later returned to Mexico City, where his mother awaited. ""When I arrived I was very happy to see my family, but at the same time very sad because I had left everything behind,"" he said. ""All my dreams had collapsed."" Zarco now works at a call center in Mexico City and dreams of studying dentistry at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The majority of these youths migrated to the United States because of their parents' decisions and more than half crossed the border illegally. Initially it wasn't them, but their parents who sought the dream. ""My mother was living in the U.S. and she decided to take me there,"" Zarco said. ""I didn't want to go because I didn't want to leave my friends and my relatives."" Back in Mexico, he now tries to find his own dream. In addition to having been deported or having returned voluntarily, these youths must unlearn the routines they grew into in the United States, where they spoke Spanish and ate tacos at home while they learned the American culture and honored the U.S. flag. They find themselves immersed in a bicultural reality that can create feelings of not belonging, even when they return to Mexico. ""I never felt like a U.S. citizen, I always felt like a Mexican,"" said Daniel Arenas, who lived in the United States for 14 years. 'From here and from there' While it is true that the obstacles the youth face depend on individual circumstances, ""100% go through traumatic events because of the separation and lack of belonging,"" according to Jill Anderson, author of a book called ""The Other Dreamers."" Humiliation over a supposed failure and feelings arising from the combination of culture tend to be common, Anderson said. ""It's hard to understand that they can be both from here and from there,"" she said. ""You belong to a country that you have not lived in, that you don't know,"" said Marco Antonio Castillo, president of the Popular Assembly of Migrant Families, a Mexico City-based group that helps advise migrants. The loneliness and confusion in dealing with the new environment can push many youths to join organized crime, Castillo said. ""For example, those who arrive in (the state of) Guerrero, if they have a criminal record, will not find opportunities in the formal economy,"" Castillo said. ""But he can put his English to use for organized crime, acting as a translator or smuggler of drugs toward the United States."" Drowning in paperwork . Anderson leads a group that shares the name of her book, whose members insist on finding the Mexican Dream and seek opportunities in their country. The group, formed by youth immigrants who returned to Mexico, was born out of the impact they suffered upon their return, feeling lost among the legal paperwork and social customs. They used a Facebook page to orient themselves on how to maneuver through the Mexican bureaucracy. Many don't speak Spanish well and the Mexican system doesn't have programs for social reinsertion. ""The migrants don't know how to do the paperwork and to what agencies to go to,"" Anderson said. ""Returning to Mexico and not speaking Spanish or dressing a certain way, or liking a certain type of music, also creates conflict,"" Arenas said. To study in Mexico, the education ministry requires that all documents be translated and bear the seal of the institute that issued them. Unable to complete this step, these youths ""are treated like undocumented immigrants in their own country,"" Anderson said. Sometimes, a lack of family support or economic resources keep needed paperwork from being completed. ""There are times when the schools in the United States ask for their former student to show up in person to pick up documents, even though they've been deported,"" she said. In most cases, the young immigrants left their families in the United States. They dream of returning to see them or to earn a livelihood in Mexico to bring them over. The loneliness and emotional exhaustion can bring feelings of not belonging to any place. But that is not true in every case. ""I felt that I arrived and was here in my place here in Mexico from day one,"" Hernandez said. Once they adapt to Mexican society, many feel free. They enjoy not having to hide. They feel thankful for the country that once again is their home. ""It's true, I am achieving my Mexican Dream now in this moment, but my life is incomplete,"" said another youth, Pedro Hernandez. ""I am far from my family.""","More and more Mexican immigrants in the United States are returning to Mexico .
The so-called ""DREAMers"" go back for lack of opportunities stateside .
They have to face challenges in reintegrating themselves to Mexico .
Some don't speak Spanish well and blend cultures ."
"(CNN) -- Airport dining doesn't have to be terminal. A new wave of airport restaurants is elevating airport cuisine above the level of greasy burgers and wilting sushi, as celebrity chefs and regional food heroes bring their magic to the one-time culinary wasteland of the airport. Many of the chefs involved are Michelin-starred, and their offerings rate alongside the finest restaurants in their cities. The better restaurants that are located in the public areas of their respective airports, such as Hong Kong's Hung's Delicacies and La Moraga in Malaga, Spain, have become magnets for non-traveling locals, achieving the hitherto unthinkable by turning the airport into a foodie destination. Across the industry, there is a broader recognition that many among the captive audience of travelers are looking for something more substantial than simply filling a hole in their stomachs, and would place a premium on quality food in stylish surroundings. Industry awards such as those made by Skytrax include categories recognizing the best airport restaurant offerings. This year the top five awards went to Hong Kong International, London Heathrow, Munich, Singapore Changi and Amsterdam Schiphol, in that order. Here is CNN's pick of restaurants that are raising the bar in terms of airport dining. One Flew South, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, USA . Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport lays claim to the title of the world's busiest airport. But in Terminal E, at One Flew South, you can find respite from the commotion. Executive chef Duane Nutter's upscale, Southern-influenced cuisine includes crowd-pleasers such as his signature pork-belly sliders, pecan-dusted scallops and pulled duck sandwiches, while the bar runs a strong selection of classic and original cocktails. See also: Celebrity chefs create mile-high menus . Hung's Delicacies, Hong Kong International Airport . Hung's Delicacies began as humble side-street bistro in Hong Kong in 2003, but soon earned a sizzling reputation on the city's food scene for its distinctive dishes, cooked in a secret marinade. Favorites include duck tongues in Chinese liquor, sliced goose in marinade and chicken leg tendons in sesame oil. The original restaurant has won a Michelin star three years running, and its airport offshoot is even drawing local residents to the airport for a meal. ""I treat every customer as a gourmet and listen to their opinions. That's the reason why I can cook unique dishes,"" chef Lai Wai-Hung told CNN. La Moraga, Malaga Airport, Spain . La Moraga, in Terminal three of Spain's Malaga Airport, is a stylish gastrobar serving contemporary tapas, desserts and more substantial creations. Typical fare includes the oxtail burger, and cherry gazpacho. The restaurant is the brainchild of Andalusian master chef Dani Garcia -- a recipient of the National Gastronomy Prize from Spain's top culinary authority -- who has won Michelin stars for his restaurants Tragabuches, in Malaga, and Calima in Marbella. Plane Food, London Heathrow Airport, UK . Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, recipient of more than a dozen Michelin stars across his restaurant portfolio, has brought his winning formula to London Heathrow Airport. Plane Food, his stylish restaurant in Terminal five, offers fare such as crumbed fried pork, steamed sea bass, and a short rib burger. Heathrow's restaurant offerings were voted the world's second-best at this year's Skytrax awards. Bubbles Seafood and Wine Bar, Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam, The Netherlands . Bubbles Seafood and Wine Bar is a place where passengers can enjoy ocean-fresh oysters, lobster and champagne amidst designer surroundings -- next to an aquarium of tropical fish. What's not to like? Schiphol was voted the world's fifth best airport for restaurants at this year's Skytrax awards. Altitude, Geneva International Airport, Switzerland . Fine dining and fanastic views combine at Altitude, where travelers can enjoy the creations of Michelin-award winning chefs Gilles Dupont, Thomas Byrne and Fabien Legon, while taking in sweeping views over the Jura Mountains. Selections include Kamchatka crab ravioli, duck foie gras with quince and pepper chutney, beef tartare and, of course, Swiss cheeses.","A new wave of restaurants is bringing upscale cuisine to airports .

"(CNN) -- 1980s nostalgia is about to intensify. This week, ABC television will premiere its new show ""The Goldbergs,"" a sitcom about a suburban middle-class family in the 1980s that loves to yell and scream. The pilot promises to bring back memories of colorful leg warmers, REO Speedwagon, Sam Goody stores, and Simon electronic game units. ""Before there were parenting blogs, trophies for showing up, and peanut allergies,"" the network's online description says, ""there was a simpler time called the '80s."" While the program will showcase the lighter side of American culture in the 1980s, we should remember the decade was anything but simple when it came to politics. There were huge changes that took place in this pivotal decade that continue to shape politics today. Tax cuts and deregulation: The roots of our current economic policies lie in the 1980s. With Ronald Reagan in the White House, Republicans were able to have a huge impact on taxation and regulation. One of Reagan's signature changes was the tax reduction of 1981, which significantly lowered income tax rates and weakened the ability of the federal government to raise revenue. While there have been tax increases since that time, the trajectory of the overall rate structure has generally moved downward, making it extremely difficult for the government to finance new programs without raising the deficit. The Reagan administration was also very successful at promoting economic deregulation. The idea of deregulation had already gained bipartisan support in the 1970s. Democrats like Sen. Ted Kennedy pushed for the deregulation of the airline industry to help consumers, while conservative economists like Milton Friedman championed deregulation to free up markets. But Reagan sold the idea like no other politician before him. He believed that markets were superior to government at almost every turn. His aggressive push for deregulation of markets would continue to influence debate in the 1990s as Democrats joined the GOP in dismantling New Deal programs that had monitored financial markets. The nation paid the price with the devastating financial collapse of 2008. Life and politics in the 1980s . The end of the Cold War: The end of the Cold War started in the middle of the 1980s. While young Americans such as Barry -- the middle child in the television show and the family upon which it is based -- were mostly worried about what cassette tapes they should buy and getting their first car, Reagan entered into a series of historic negotiations with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev between 1985 and 1987 that culminated with the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987. Following the treaty, the Soviet Union would collapse in the years when George H.W. Bush was in the White House. Since the 1980s American foreign policy has been characterized by a shifting and murky battle against rogue states and terrorist networks. The battle lines have never offered voters or politicians the same kind of clarity as existed in the Cold War, often making it more difficult to mobilize long-term support behind military operations and producing confusion about what policymakers are even trying to achieve. This was true even after 9/11 as the U.S. became bogged down in a war in Iraq that had little to do with the source of the attack. Liberalization of social and cultural values: Even with Reagan and Bush in the White House, American culture continued to embrace the values from the Age of Aquarius. During this decade, Americans were listening to more explicit lyrics in their music, watching television shows and movies that had more sexuality and violence, and listening to radio shows such as Howard Stern's which abandoned the social inhibitions of the 1940s and 1950s, when the original ""Goldbergs"" aired on radio and television. Beyond entertainment, public health crises -- most importantly the spread of the deadly AIDS virus -- required policymakers to have more honest talks with the public about sexual relations. In 1987, hundreds of thousands of activists marched on Washington to call on the federal government to devote more resources to combating AIDS. As homosexuality became less of a taboo, more gay Americans came out of the closet. There were also celebrities who made a difference. In 1985, the publicist of the actor Rock Hudson, a very close friend of the president, announced that Hudson had AIDS. Although his people said it had resulted from a blood transfusion, the media soon reported that Hudson had been gay. Americans were also living in a country that was becoming even more ethnically and culturally diverse, as the waves of immigration that had swept into the nation since the immigration reform of 1965 remade the cities and suburbs. Americans became familiar with the world that Asian, Latino and other immigrants were building. In recent years, Americans have been giving their strong support to gay rights and rejecting those who warn that recent developments, such as same-sex marriage, are pushing the nation in the wrong direction. There is also very little support for efforts to impose regulations on popular culture, and much more comfort that there is no danger in Americans' having more honest discussions and cultural exposure to sexuality. While some conservatives adhere to hard-line positions on immigration restriction, national polls show that most Americans support a path to citizenship. The 24-hour news media: In 1980, CNN began, and the erosion of the era of network news dominance was under way. The network news established in the 1960s had revolved around three nightly news shows, each approximately a half-hour in length. CNN broke the mold when it began the 24-hour news cycle from its Atlanta studios. With CNN, the flow of information was constant and it was much harder for politicians to respond to the emergence of stories. Other cable news networks soon emerged, including Fox News, CNBC and MSNBC, as cable became a dominant mode of information. The Internet followed this same model, making the news cycle even more intense. This media cycle had a number of effects. It fragmented and decentralized the distribution of news information, making it more difficult for politicians, including the president, to reach broad national audiences, since viewers could tune in to a much wider variety of stations. Once the Fairness Doctrine, which had required stations to give opposing viewpoints equal airtime, came to an end in 1987, the cable networks could air more partisan newscasts. The proliferation of channels and the 24-hour cycle intensified the competition among news outlets to release information as fast as possible and to find stories about political scandal and conflict that would attract viewers. This fueled the partisan polarization that was taking place in Washington during this decade. As viewers watch the antics of the Goldbergs, remembering or learning about what life was like in long-ago suburbia, it's worth thinking about the bigger changes that were taking place outside the home that have continued to shape our politics. The 1980s are much more than nostalgia. We live in the fast-changing world of the 21st century, yet ours is a society that owes much to the way things were three decades ago. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: New TV show may add to nostalgia for the 1980s .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The economic might of India may bring to mind technological savvy and overseas call centers. But to understand the Indian economy, a visit to a roadside dentist like Raj Kishore is more illuminating. The Indian economy is fueled by independent workers such as Radha Kumar. ""I can extract, I can fill up, I can scale, I can make dentures, I can make bridge metal or non-metal."" Kishore said as he fitted dentures for a customer. One thing he can't do is show a license to practice -- like many roadside dentists sitting on sidewalks awaiting customers. While information technology and outsourcing has earned India the nickname as ""the world's back office,"" the sector employs a fraction of India's population -- only 2 million of India's more than 500 million workers, according to NASSCOM, an IT and business process outsourcing trade organization. So where do the majority of people work in India? The International Labor Organization and economists say as many as 95 percent of the workforce makes a living in what is known as the informal or unorganized sector. ""Roughly today about 50 percent of the production is from the unorganized sector,"" says New Delhi-based economics professor Arun Kumar, referring to jobs and services that exist without a storefront, union to represent the workers, or corporate structure. Although things are changing and the economy has boomed in recent years, Indians are still emerging from poverty. Finding employment can be tough so people have literally created jobs out of sheer necessity, such as roadside dentist Kishore. Kishore says he learned his trade from a dentist and a dental course but he does not have a degree in dentistry. He and those around him provide a service to customers who couldn't dream of affording a licensed dentist in an office. That is just one of thousands of jobs that make up India's informal economy. Radha Kumari is a Mehandi artist. She uses henna to make intricate traditional designs on women's hands and feet. It's an old art that is steeped in tradition and is typically worn by brides the day before the wedding ceremony but is also popular during other Indian holidays and with tourists. She learned the trade from her sister at age 10 and started working as a teenager. ""I started doing this work because I was needy. I have no parents; my sister has done everything for me so it was very important for me to work,"" said Kumari, a mother of two, while she swirled henna on the hand of a customer. She makes 25 to 50 rupees (50 cents to $1) per hand, she said. She and other henna artists are often ""troubled"" by city authorities or police who come to kick them off of the sidewalks or ask for bribes -- technically Kumari and others are breaking the law by setting up shop on government property. City government authorities showed up while CNN was interviewing Kumari, causing the henna artists around her to pack up and run away. It's a tough life. ""If there can be anything better, I would definitely love to do it,"" she said. ""Here there is no certainty. Today I'm allowed to sit here, tomorrow I may not be."" But Kumari says it's better than nothing at all. Experts say the informal economy helped keep India out of recession, since it is not tied to the global markets. While the ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit has help the Indian economy growing, the largely unregulated workforce promises to have negative impacts on the Indian economy as well, as transactions are often in cash and difficult to trace and tax. But the working conditions and low pay leave millions living in poverty. ""Their conditions are very poor because they have no protective gear of any kind, they have no real social security of any kind,"" said Arun Kumar, an economics professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

"(CNN) -- When United recently announced that it would install inflight Internet on all its mainline aircraft beginning next year, it might not have seemed like a big deal. After all, airlines have had Internet on board for a couple of years now and it has become quite common. This, however, is different. This is the first effort by a U.S. airline to provide Internet on intercontinental flights. You might recognize AirTran, Alaska, American, Delta and Virgin America as airlines that have been aggressively installing Internet aboard their aircraft over the last few years. Those airlines, however, are constrained by geography because of the system they use. All those carriers contract with Gogo to be their Internet provider, and Gogo transmits its signals from the ground: It has stations all over the United States that allow aircraft to connect to the Internet. But these aren't installed in the water, so fairly soon after you go ""feet wet"" on your flight, the Internet stops working. Airlines like this system because it's easy to install (it can be done overnight on an airplane), the system is relatively inexpensive and the bandwidth is cheap. That makes for a winning combination, but it does have constraints. That's why United is going a different route. United is installing satellite-based Internet on its airplanes. As long as the aircraft is in range of the satellite, then Internet can flow freely. United is far from the first airline to do this. In fact, Southwest has been installing satellite Internet for a while now as well, but there is one big issue. The problem with satellite-based Internet in general is that it's more expensive. You would expect that to be the case -- satellites don't come cheap. There are also considerations about the amount of weight added to the aircraft from the antenna, the cost and the amount of time it takes to do an install (longer than the overnight required by Gogo). Boeing's luxury offices in the sky . Airlines have been hesitant to sink a lot of money into something that, so far, hasn't seen much usage. Though reports are spotty, most airlines have hinted at single-digit percentage usage on aircraft. Some see more, like Virgin America and its more tech-savvy demographic, but in general, it's not a lot. United, however, is making a bet that it will catch on in greater numbers and it will be an important amenity. How much will it cost you, the traveler? We don't know, because United hasn't said anything. But we can look at its partner airline Lufthansa to get an idea of how other long-haul airlines are pricing the same system. When you fly Lufthansa today, you can pay â‚¬10.95 for one hour (about $15) or â‚¬19.95 for 24 hours (about $27). United will certainly come up with its own pricing, but this gives you a sense of what you're looking at. Five extraordinary airport lounges . Now that United has made the move, we have to wait and see if others will follow. A Delta spokesperson says the airline is ""reviewing international connectivity options for our customers but (we) don't have further details at this time."" It might not actually be United's move that pushes others to offer long-haul Internet but rather technological advances. Last month, a new satellite was launched into space, and it will provide faster, cheaper Internet. (It uses a different technology than the service United has signed up with for its long-haul flights). JetBlue subsidiary LiveTV has been offering this option, and JetBlue itself will begin installing it on its fleet next year. Will Delta and American eventually fall in line and put Internet on their long haul fleets? I would imagine so, but when it happens and with what technology still remains to be seen.","United to become first U.S. airline to provide Internet on intercontinental flights .

"(CNN) -- Her ankles bound, her mouth covered with duct tape, Christina Anderson was bashed at least 12 times in the head. Her 8-year-old son Ethan's body was burned beyond recognition. Those were some of the grisly details released this week by the San Diego Medical Examiner's office investigating the deaths connected to the Hannah Anderson kidnapping case, a case that captured the nation's interest last month. In August, Christina Anderson, 42, and Ethan were killed by family friend James Lee DiMaggio, who then set fire to his house and kidnapped 16-year-old Hannah, authorities said. This led to a multi-state manhunt that ended with the FBI shooting DiMaggio, 40, in the Idaho woods and Hannah's rescue. DiMaggio's sister: Hannah Anderson was 'trouble' Few details had been released about the deaths of Christina and Ethan Anderson. But the autopsy reports obtained by CNN give shocking details. Christina Anderson's ankles were bound by a plastic cable tie, and duct tape was wrapped around her neck and mouth, her autopsy report said. Her right arm and both legs were fractured, and there was a cut on her neck. Her body was found in the garage of the burning home, alongside a family dog that had been shot. Ethan was found in another part of the home, burned beyond recognition. It was believed, according to the autopsy, that the boy died because of the fire. Ethan also had skeletal fractures that could have been caused by events that day. San Diego County deputies searching DiMaggio's charred home found a handwritten note, handcuff box, camping equipment, a DNA swab kit, two used condoms and letters from Hannah, according to an affidavit. Contents of the letters and the handwritten note were not revealed in the affidavit. In an interview since the ordeal, Hannah called herself a survivor. ""In the beginning I was a victim, but now knowing everyone out there is helping me, I consider myself a survivor instead,"" she told NBC News. ""My mom raised me to be strong.""

"(CNN) -- With nothing more than a piano, a little black dress and a microphone, Adele rouses crowds using her emotions and her voice. It's her modus operandi, and it's likely how viewers will see the British songstress perform at the Grammy Awards on Sunday. The awards show will be Adele's first time taking the stage since she underwent laser microsurgery on a benign polyp on her vocal cords in November. That, in addition to the fact that she's credited with the music industry's 2011 uptick, means all eyes will certainly be on her. Nominated for six Grammy Awards, including nods for album of the year and song of the year, Adele surprised fans when she tweeted about her impending performance. Keith Caulfield, the associate director of charts at Billboard, said he expects the singer to captivate viewers on Sunday night, just as she did at the BRIT Awards in February 2011 and then again at the MTV Video Music Awards in August. ""On the off chance that she has a bum note, everyone has survived from a not great performance,"" Caulfield said. ""I don't expect anything less than really good."" And still, a simple performance will be enough, he added. ""You don't see pyrotechnics and fog behind Adele,"" Caulfield said. ""She doesn't need that. ... There are no bells and whistles. It's just her, great song writing, a beautiful voice and great charisma."" Having already spent 18 weeks atop Billboard's Hot 200, sold more than 6 million albums and spawned three chart-topping singles, Adele's ballads have also become anthems for scorned lovers everywhere. ""Every year, some album ends up at No. 1,"" said David Bakula, Nielsen's senior vice president of analytics for entertainment. ""There's always going to be something that rises to the top. But when it's this unique and sales are this unprecedented, it's special."" Album sales rose in 2011, marking the music industry's first uptick since Usher's ""Confessions"" sold 8 million units in 2004. And Adele is partially to thank for the boom. Sales from her two albums -- her 2008 debut, ""19,"" and ""21,"" her sophomore album, released early last year -- accounted for 2% of all industry album sales in 2011. ""19"" sold 460,000 units in 2009, the year Adele won two Grammys for the album. But, more than three years after its release, the singer's catalog title had its best week in December, selling 71,000 units, Bakula said. And so Adele finished out 2011 with two of the year's best-selling albums. ""It does take a very special artist, and a very special song and album release, to move the type of quantities we're talking about here,"" Bakula said. According to Nielsen SoundScan, ""21"" is the first album to sell more than 1 million digital copies in a year. ""People say, 'How can there still be 100,000 people who don't have this album?' ... It just shows the latent demand for great music out there,"" Bakula said. And there's a good chance that after Adele performs at the Grammys, the numbers will continue to grow throughout 2012, he added. ""Every day, more and more people are just discovering her, or just being convinced that they should buy her album and not be content with listening to her on Spotify or YouTube,"" said Caulfield, the associate director of charts at Billboard. Speculation was heavy as to whether the British chanteuse would be able to perform at the Grammys after her surgery. Since the debut of her sophomore album, there have been breathless reviews and almost constant praise heaped upon the single-named singer. She's even crossed over into meme territory in the form of a ""S*** Adele says"" video. During her February 2011 appearance on E!'s ""Chelsea Lately,"" Adele said she sees the constantly evolving interest in her music firsthand at her shows. ""I love seeing the way people respond to my music,"" she said. ""I love it when, like, a husband or a partner gets dragged along who doesn't want to be there, and you've got to win them over because they're giving you the evil (eye). ... And by the end, they're hugging their girlfriend ... or crying. I love it."" Because her vocal cord issues forced her to cancel the remainder of her 2011 appearances, she wasn't able to convert the disillusioned partners that might have been present at her shows. After falling ill, Adele stayed off the radar to rest up, Caulfield said, adding, ""Meanwhile, her singles are going to No. 1, her albums continue to sell -- that's the kind of career an artist would kill for. ... Everyone else is slogging around ... doing TV shows and concert tours."" Bakula agreed, referencing artists such as Lady Gaga and Katy Perry, who made their presence known in 2011 with advertisements and various appearances. Yet, Adele's singles are still permanent fixtures on the radio, but not in the same way that Bruno Mars and the Black Eyed Peas are, Yahoo.com music columnist Paul Grein said. ""(Some pop artists) live and die by their latest hit single,"" Grein said. ""And Adele, even though she's having big hits, too ... you have the sense that her career probably won't always be as a big radio star."" She could be compared to someone like Sade, he said, ""who has had hits, or not had hits, but has sold albums throughout a very long career."" Regardless of how we're hearing her music, Caulfield said, many people are finding it ""refreshing that it isn't necessarily programmed for your enjoyment."" In fact, some people have said her music is actually programmed to play in the background while you weep. And there's a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch to prove it. One Boston Globe writer even profiled a few people brave enough to admit to crying along to Adele's ""Someone Like You."" ""(Adele) really struck a chord at the right time,"" Bakula said. ""As soon as people heard it, it was gold. Well, platinum, in this case.""","Adele will perform at the Grammy Awards on Sunday night .

"(CNN) -- Pigeons and mole rats are some of the stars of his stories. To a nation of toddlers, they are heroes. Children's author Mo Willems has written more than 40 books, and he's at it again. Willems, who started as a writer and animator on ""Sesame Street,"" draws animals who aren't usually associated with starring roles. He depicts deep desires that he says all children -- and adults -- share. In ""Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!"" a bird pleads with readers to let him steer when a bus driver takes a break. His latest star is a fat goose in a story called ""That is Not a Good Idea!"" which also features a fox and a big bowl of soup. Willems is a novelty in his industry because he illustrates most of the stories he writes. Many of his books are fixtures on the shelves of children ages 5 and under. His name appears often on New York Times best-seller lists of children's picture books. Young readers might also be familiar with the misadventures of Knuffle Bunny, a stuffed animal who is loved and lost in a series of books. Like all of Willems' protagonists, the bunny is easy for young fans to draw. Willems, who lives in Massachusetts, welcomes his fans' attempts to doodle their own versions of his characters. He told CNN how he creates classic children's tales from a garden of ideas, and encourages copyright infringement from his young fans. Below is an edited transcript. CNN: How did you come up with the notion that every 2-year-old wants to drive a bus? Willems: If you had an opportunity to drive a bus, would you do that? I mean, it's primal. It's absolutely primal. Have you ever walked by a bus and the bus driver isn't in it? I mean you really have to pull all of your power not to just jump in. We don't go, because we know we're going to get arrested, or we'll be late for work, and it'll be bad on our credit score. But if all that stuff disappeared, and you walked by a running bus without a driver in it, you would get in that bus. CNN: Have you seen some of your fans drawing the pigeon? Willems:  Oh yes. Absolutely. I love it. I get a box every month filled with (letters from) kids infringing on my copyright. It is a legalistic nightmare, and a complete joy. And I post on my blog my favorites. But I just love it. I started out drawing Charlie Brown and Snoopy. And then I would have my own characters interacting with them. When I start seeing kids draw their characters interacting with the pigeon, you see that the creative crutch is going away, and that they're really becoming authors. For me, it's so important to doodle and draw. In my house, every night at dinner we have a big piece of paper that we put on our dining room table as our tablecloth and we doodle. I fear that grownups just don't doodle anymore. There is a day in everybody's life when they realize that they're not going to be a professional basketball player and they're not going to be a professional cartoonist. It's usually the same week. But people keep playing basketball. And they stop drawing. And I just think that that's such a waste. CNN: What inspires you? Willems: I'm very lucky to write for children, because I don't have to deal with popular culture. I can just deal with core fundamental issues: jealousy, love, hatred, sadness, joy, wanting to drive a bus. The fundamental core emotional things. And just asking questions like, 'How do you know when you're in control? What is a friend? What are relationships between people?' These are all things that I haven't figured out yet. I'm very lucky in that I don't understand the world yet. If I understood the world, it would be harder for me to write these books. CNN: How do you create a timeless tale? Willems: That's a tough question. Besides dumb luck, I'm not sure. I do have a couple of rules that I place for myself in my books. The first is a mantra, which is: Always think of your audience, but never think for your audience. What that means is to leave it open to interpretation. I'm not telling things, I'm asking questions. And I'm asking questions that I don't necessarily have the answers to. The other formal thing that I do is that I make sure that the characters in my books -- in this ('That Is Not a Good Idea!') case, the chicks in particular -- are characters that a 4- or a 5-year-old can draw: infringe on my copyright with great ease. So a lot of my design work is reductive. I make drawings, then I try to take as many lines out, so that it's at its easiest to copy. CNN: Which comes first: the characters or the ideas? Willems: It all depends. A lot of people think of ideas as objects, or animals that you hunt. You go into the woods, you find an idea, you capture it and you bring it home. And ideas really are more like gardens. And every day, you're planting lots and lots of ideas. Some of them get eaten by birds, and never go anywhere. Some of them grow up to be really horrible things. Some wither and die. Every now and then, over time, some idea grows up to be big and beautiful and filled with fruit. You can cut that down and burn it for profit. So it's an evolution. CNN: What was the inspiration for your latest book? Willems: I think this one is about the question of: 'What is control?' And also about pacing, and suspense, and being helpless. In 'Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!' you yell 'No!' and you change the situation. The pigeon doesn't get to drive the bus because you yelled no. In this, you're yelling, 'That's not a good idea!' but it's still going to happen. You're seeing that truck wreck about to occur. It's about trying to change the world, and maybe not being able to. I don't know. I don't know what it's about. And you know what? Frankly, it's not my job. My job is to make the book. You guys figure out the meaning. Come back to me, you tell me what it's about. CNN: What made you want to transition from television into writing children's books? Willems: Books have a lot more space for the individual. I'm very interested in things like failure, which most television executives don't think is a theme that they want to have. And just on a technical level, my books can be small. They can be long. They can be tall. A television is always the same size. I can be much more individual.

"(CNN) -- Arnold Schwarzenegger is on the road a lot, whether he's filming a movie in Bulgaria or presenting awards to ridiculously fit people in Spain. So who better to offer tips on working out while traveling? It's obvious the former bodybuilding champ has kept in shape. In a video he posted on Instagram on Thursday, Schwarzenegger barely breaks a sweat as he tackles the elliptical and several weight machines in his hotel gym. ""Someone on Reddit asked what it was like for me to train in hotel gyms or other unfamiliar gyms on the road,"" Schwarzenegger posted. ""The answer is: just like it is for you. There is no waiting to train until you have perfect circumstances. I improvise with whatever is available. ""I walk in and my only rule is to keep moving, for a pump and cardio at the same time. Rest as little as possible. After an hour, you will feel fantastic and your muscles won't know what hit them."" The actor trains every day for at least an hour to be in shape for movies like ""Escape Plan,"" which releases in theaters tonight. A Reddit user posted a link to the Instagram video on the site, and Schwarzenegger, a frequent Reddit contributor, jumped on to offer some more advice. ""The point isn't the machines or the exercises,"" he wrote. ""The point is that you can create a workout for your goals anywhere. Even if you just use a chair for dips, a table for rows and the floor for pushups."" Schwarzenegger said he enjoys working out in unfamiliar gyms, even if sometimes he'd prefer to be at home. ""I like shocking my system,"" he wrote, ""so I look at the bright side."" You have to wonder if the bodybuilder-turned actor-turned governor-turned-actor ever gets interrupted during his workout. Occasionally, he said, but mostly people keep to themselves. Fair warning to fans in New Orleans, where Schwarzenegger is filming ""Maggie"": The actor said he welcomes people who want to say hello to him while he's resting between sets, but ""don't slow me down while I'm working."" Maybe it's just us, but we would never bother someone with these biceps mid-grunt. Of course, staring at him oddly isn't a good idea either.

"(CNN) -- After two years of claiming that his views were ""evolving,"" President Obama said on Wednesday that he has finally reached a conclusion and supports same-sex marriage. Obama's public endorsement is an important step in the right direction, but it does not undo the fact that he has a mixed record on gay rights. This defining moment came only after the issue was pushed to the headlines by Vice President Joe Biden's open support for same-sex couples. When Obama first took office, many had high hopes. After all, six months in, a press release was sent out entitled: ""President Obama Announces Benefits for Gay Partners of Federal Employees."" It seemed like a momentous occasion, the fulfillment of a promise by the candidate who had vowed to become a ""fierce advocate"" of gay rights. Instead, what followed was mostly a charade, and a very successful one. At the time, almost everyone thought Obama was extending equal rights to same-sex employees in the government. Why wouldn't they? There was a White House ceremony, seen around the world, that showed the president signing some sort of impressive-sounding document regarding federal benefits and nondiscrimination. Give the Obama team credit for a successful political maneuver. But the discrimination against same-sex federal employees did not end. Not even close. Benefits for gay federal employees are much closer to those of their heterosexual colleagues, if they are posted abroad. So if you want the federal government to stop discriminating, you basically have to leave the country. It also turned out that federal employees cannot sign up their partners -- even their legally married ones -- for benefits as basic as health insurance. Obama's highly touted memorandum gives partners of same-sex federal employees the ability to apply for private long-term care insurance, with no discernible advantage over what they would find elsewhere. Let's be clear -- it's not Obama's fault that Congress passed and Bill Clinton signed the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which says marriage refers only to heterosexual couples. Obama has said that he opposes the legislation. But the Obama administration has gone out of its way to create an impression that it has done much more for gay people than it actually has. In fact, Obama's Justice Department actively defended the anti-gay Defense of Marriage Act in court until last year. When Karen Golinski, a federal lawyer, managed a rare victory in obtaining coverage by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program for the woman she legally married, the Obama administration made sure the benefits would not extend to anyone else. In light of these contradictory -- almost deceptive -- moves by his administration, it's no wonder that Obama has found himself swirling in turbulence over his wobbly position on gay rights. Comparatively, discrimination on employee benefits is not controversial and it requires much less ammunition than fighting against other forms of discrimination. Americans reject it decisively. Several years ago, two-thirds of Americans told Gallup that ""gay and lesbian domestic partners should have access to health insurance and other employee benefits."" And that was before support for gay marriage became broader. The president can only gain from taking a strong position against same-sex discrimination. It will energize his base and help him look like an advocate for fairness and not just another cynical politician. The people who strongly oppose equality in employee benefits would never vote for him anyway. Everyone else would probably find it refreshing to see a politician march out of the morass of ambiguity and double-talk and for once take a clear strong position. Ironically, Obama has mocked Mitt Romney for flip-flopping on gay rights. In fact, both of them have tried to play all sides of this issue, coldly calculating political advantage. Some have thought that Obama's personal experience as the African-American son of a mixed-race couple would make him into a fierce advocate of equality and justice. Instead, many in the gay community have derided him for his ""cowardice."" But the president's record hasn't been all misses. He achieved an important victory when he had don't ask, don't tell overturned. But until he seemed to have no choice, he remained extraordinarily quiet on gay issues, even though he continues to collect millions of dollars in donations from gay activists. He has spoken out only when absolutely necessary and sometimes not even then. Gay leaders implored Obama to lend support before a close vote on gay rights in Maine. They blamed him partly for the loss. On the recent North Carolina constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, Obama issued a statement against the amendment through a spokesman, and declared that he was disappointed only after it passed. Obama's claims that he cares about equality for gays have not seemed sincere. Now that he has emphatically stated that same-sex marriage should be legal, he ought to make passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act a priority. He should take a stand personally, not through press releases and spokesmen, against discrimination. He should support the bill that calls for the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act. Now he should follow up his landmark statement with actions that will have practical, not just symbolic impact . As country after country removes barriers to equality for gay couples, the United States should take a lesson. Same-sex marriage, one of the highest hurdles, is already recognized legally in places as different as Canada, Argentina, Israel, South Africa and Spain, among others. Nondiscrimination in employee benefits is far more common, not just for reasons of fairness but also because it allows organizations to compete for the best talent. The decision to at long last finish the evolution and come out in support of gay marriage is a major step. But, Mr. President, when it comes to fighting discrimination, there are principles to defend, promises to keep and miles to go before you sleep.

"(CNN) -- A day after losing the first presidential debate, President Barack Obama and his campaign accused his Republican challenger Mitt Romney of being dishonest about tax policy and other issues. ""If you want to be president, you owe the American people the truth,"" Obama said at a campaign rally Thursday in Denver. ""So here's the truth: Governor Romney cannot pay for his $5 trillion tax plan without blowing up the deficit or sticking it to the middle class. That's the math."" Romney's pledge: No tax cut for the rich . The president's top aides were even more blunt. ""Romney's performance was one that's probably unprecedented in its dishonesty,"" senior adviser David Plouffe told reporters. Still, senior campaign adviser David Axelrod acknowledged Obama will examine his debate strategy for the next two contests -- on October 16 in New York and October 22 in Florida. The president opted against ""serial fact-checking with Governor Romney, which can be a never-ending, exhausting pursuit,"" Axelrod said. ""Obviously, going forward, we're going to have to look at this, and we're going to have make some adjustments."" What's next: Can Obama recover or will Romney run up the score? Meanwhile, Romney continued to push his debate theme that there's been much federal spending under Obama, complaining of ""trickle-down government"" that has failed to solve the nation's economic woes. ""Trickle-down government that the president proposes is one where he will raise taxes on small business, which will kill jobs"" he said in an unannounced visit Thursday to a conservative conference in Colorado. ""I instead want to keep taxes down on small business so we can create jobs."" He and his vice presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, then appeared together Thursday night in Fisherville, in western Virginia. Ryan touted the National Rifle Association's endorsement earlier in the day of the GOP ticket, adding that he's looking forward to when ""after we elect Mitt Romney president, I can take my daughter deer hunting."" Both the Wisconsin congressman and Romney, who followed him onstage, referenced the previous night's debate as demonstrating ""a clear choice"" for voters. ""Last night was an important night for the country, because people got the chance to cut through all the attacks and the counterattacks and all the theatrics associated with the campaign, and instead they were able to listen to substance,"" said the former Massachusetts governor. Analysis: Five reason the president fumbled the debate . ""As a result ..., the American people recognize that (Obama) and I stand for something very different,"" he said, before vowing, ""I am going to help the American people get good jobs and a bright future."" His supporters crowed about his debate performance, saying it reshaped a race that Romney had appeared in danger of losing. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who played the role of the president in debate rehearsals for Romney, said the GOP candidate had a ""terrific night"" in discussing Obama's record, talking about his own policies and setting ""the record straight on ... misleading ads."" ""He did exactly what he had to do for the undecided voter in Ohio or around the country,"" Portman said. To Ed Gillespie, a senor adviser to Romney, the GOP challenger brought focus to the sharp contrast between the candidates by showing voters that ""we can't afford four more years like the last four years."" While both sides were in full spin mode Thursday, it was widely felt that Romney won the debate itself. Analysis: Romney seizes the story . ""A week ago, people were saying this was over. We've got a horse race,"" said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, who called the debate Romney's best so far after the 22 the former Massachusetts governor took part in during the GOP primary campaign. Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor, expressed surprise at Romney's strong performance, saying he ""rose to the moment"" and seemed to benefit from the multiple primary debates. ""It looked like Romney wanted to be there and President Obama didn't want to be there,"" noted Democratic strategist and CNN contributor James Carville. ""The president didn't bring his 'A' game."" The CNN/ORC International poll of 430 people who watched the debate showed 67% thought Romney won, compared with 25% for Obama. Obama joked Thursday that a different Romney appeared at the debate from the conservative candidate who won a grueling primary campaign to challenge him on November 6. ""When I got on to the stage I met this very spirited fellow who claimed to be Mitt Romney,"" Obama said told the crowd of more than 12,000 at a Denver park. ""But it couldn't have been Mitt Romney because the real Mitt Romney has been running around the country for the last year promising $5 trillion in tax cuts that favor the wealthy. The fellow on stage last night said he didn't know anything about that."" In Denver and later in Wisconsin, Obama also went after Romney's pledge during the debate to cut funding for public broadcasting, referring specifically to the popular Sesame Street character Big Bird. ""He'll get rid of regulations on Wall Street, but he's going to crack down on Sesame Street,"" Obama joked about Romney's pledge to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act that reforms the financial sector. ""Thank goodness somebody is finally getting tough on Big Bird,"" Obama added. ""It's about time. We didn't know that Big Bird was driving the federal deficit."" 5 things we learned from the presidential debate . During Wednesday's 90-minute debate, neither presidential candidate scored dramatic blows that will make future highlight reels, and neither veered from campaign themes and policies to date. Moderator Jim Lehrer of PBS had trouble keeping the duo within time limits for responses, especially Obama, who ended up speaking four minutes longer than Romney. Romney criticized Obama's record and depicted the president's vision as one of big government, while the Democratic incumbent defended his achievements and challenged his rival's prescriptions as unworkable. But Romney came off as the more energized candidate overall by repeatedly attacking Obama on red-meat issues for Republicans such as health care reform and higher taxes, while the president began with lengthy explanations and only later focused more on what his opponent was saying. The former governor's strongest moments came in criticizing Obama's record, saying the nation's high unemployment and sluggish economic recovery showed the president's policies haven't worked. Complete coverage of CNN fact-checking the candidates . ""There's no question in my mind if the president is re-elected, you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze,"" Romney said, adding that another term for Obama also will mean the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, ""will be fully installed."" At another point, he noted how $90 billion spent on programs and policies to develop alternative energy sources could have been devoted to hiring teachers or other needs that would bring down unemployment. Obama argued his policies were working to bring America back from the financial and economic crisis he inherited, and that Romney refused to divulge specifics about his proposed tax plans and replacements for the health care law and Wall Street reform that the Republican has pledged to repeal. At crossroads of economic crisis, debate disappoints . In one of his strongest lines of the night, Obama said Romney lacked the important leadership quality of being able to say ""no"" when necessary. ""I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party,"" Obama said in reference to his challenger's swing to the right during the primaries to appeal to the GOP's conservative base. Romney rejected Obama's characterization of his tax plan, insisting it won't add to the deficit, and criticized the president's call to allow tax rates on income over $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals to return to higher 1990s rates as a job-snuffing tax hike on small business. Romney repeatedly went after Obama on the health care reform bill, criticizing the president for focusing so strongly on a measure that passed with no Republican support instead of devoting more attention to creating jobs. ""I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people,"" Romney said. ""The right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care,"" Romney added, quickly noting his plan would include popular provisions of Obamacare such as allowing children up to age 26 stay on family plans and preventing insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- An American woman traveling in northern India was allegedly gang-raped Tuesday after she accepted a ride with three men in a truck, police said. Authorities said the 31-year-old woman was on her way back to Manali, one of the region's most popular tourist destinations, when she got into the truck with the men around 1 a.m. They allegedly took her to an isolated area and raped her, police said. The director general of police in the state of Himachal Pradesh ordered an immediate investigation into the incident and directed state police to scour the area for the alleged perpetrators. No information has been released on the woman's condition, authorities said. She has been assigned a police escort as the investigation continues. Violent rapes in India have made headlines recently. A 4-year-old girl died after being sexually assaulted by a 35-year-old man in Ghansaur in April, and a 5-year-old girl was allegedly raped two weeks earlier in New Delhi. Two men were arrested in that case. Six men are facing rape and burglary charges after allegedly raping a Swiss tourist in March. And a 23-year-old woman was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi in December and later died of her injuries. Five men were charged in the case, but one has since died in prison. That attack spurred protests across the nation, where most women have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations.","The 31-year-old woman was traveling in northern India .

"(CNN) -- The ""girl on bike"" is a familiar trope in the motorcycle world, which is why the editor of American motorcycle blog Asphalt & Rubber didn't pay much attention last year when images surfaced of a woman draped across the latest Ducati. But when the dealership responsible for the sexy images re-created them using men -- all bulging muscles and body hair, farmers' tans and booty shorts -- they caught his attention. These were the images he wanted to talk about. ""The conversation I really wanted to have is if you can put a girl on a bike, you should put a guy on a bike. And, if that looks silly to you, (then) you should rethink the other,"" said Jensen Beeler, editor of Asphalt & Rubber. ""I'm kind of tired of the 'pinup girl on motorcycle' theme that our industry does, so it was kind of fun to see someone poke that in the eye,"" Beeler said. ""I thought to myself, these are guys with a good sense of humor. They're not afraid of pushing boundaries, which is what motorcycles are all about."" But the images didn't go beyond the motorcycle world until just last month when they became a viral sensation. You probably saw them on Facebook or Twitter or on one of numerous news websites that showed them off. The overwhelmingly enthusiastic response was far different from the one Beeler got on Asphalt & Rubber in August 2012 when reactions ranged from, ""It's nice to see it go the other way for once,"" to ""Why oh why!!!!! Really?????? WTF!!!!!!!!!"" Or, as one American motorcycle PR firm said, ""Half of this made us throw up in our mouth a little bit."" But where did the photos come from, and why did they surface again now? Both sets of images were the brainchild of Arun Sharma, general manager of MotoCorsa, a Ducati dealership in Portland, Oregon. Last year, he wanted his shop to be the first to circulate promotional images of the hotly anticipated Ducati 1199 Panigale. He wanted them to be sexy but tasteful, so fans wouldn't have reservations about using them as wallpaper on their office computer. ""It's not a big secret that beautiful women and motorcycles go together, but we're not into G-strings,"" Sharma said in a phone interview. ""There are smarter ways to go about it."" Photographer and ""Moto Lady"" blogger Alicia Mariah Elfving helped style and shoot both sets of images. She also wanted to distinguish the photos of the female model from the ""pervy images"" that have defined motorcycle marketing; she prefers to see women riding bikes rather than hanging off them, she said. But as long as women were modeling, ""we wanted to do something that was classy and better looking, so the content would be accessible to a wider audience."" They shot the photos the same day the Panigale arrived in the shop. Sharma said he achieved his goal of being the first dealership to circulate images of the hottest bike on the market, bearing MotoCorsa's name and logo. As they spread throughout the world, much of the response was positive. There was some backlash, too. Tasteful or not, some said it was just another set of images of a model draped on a bike. Inspiration struck Sharma a few weeks later, he said, in one those ""You know what we should totally do?"" moments: ""We should totally do the same poses with the guys in the shop."" As Elfving remembers it, they had talked about the idea of responding to the backlash by reversing the gender of the models. ""Most people loved it, but others were like, 'Oh, a chick on a bike,' "" she said in a phone interview. ""OK, we'll give you something different then."" Sharma called a meeting and announced the plan to reshoot the images using MotoCorsa employees. A few refused to take part, he recalls, but most were enthusiastic. They drew numbers to choose who would pose for each shot. Senior technician A.J. Ralston was one of the last to choose. He is pictured precariously perched on all fours on the bike's seat. ""I thought it was a fantastic, hilarious idea,"" said Ralston, who has worked in the shop for 11 years. ""It seems like we always get a lot of flak from customers whenever we put something up on our Facebook page that has a beautiful woman on a motorcycle, so making light of all of that and having a good time doing it seemed like a good idea."" Holding the pose proved to be a challenge for the 5-foot-10-inch, 230-pound technician, especially in slingback shoes and booty shorts. ""It was that kind of day, when it was super-hot outside, so holding a pose like that with sweat everywhere and my knees slipping all over the place gave me a new appreciation for what models do,"" he said. Both versions of the images remained popular within the motorcycle community, sparking a few copycat male pinup shoots. It's not entirely clear why the images resurfaced again recently. Beeler from the Asphalt & Rubber blog said his referral traffic showed it got moving on Facebook, caught on in S&M social media circles, then moved into feminist media, catching the attention of mainstream media outlets. Sharma said he is thrilled with the renewed attention. There's been some negative reaction toward both versions, he said, but much more positive attention, overall. ""We just did it for fun, for the notoriety, and it went crazy,"" he said. ""A lot of people have turned it into something it wasn't intended to be, but that's the beautiful thing about artistic interpretation."" Beeler said he hopes it's a wake-up call to the motorcycle industry that female riders might be attracted by a more balanced approach to marketing. ""If you want more gender equality in the consumer base, we have to have more gender equality in marketing and the way you're approaching things,"" he said. ""Gender roles are still an issue that people find relevant, and I think that's why we saw it getting picked up in niches and exploding from there.""","Photo set of men posing on a Ducati motorcycle goes viral .

O'Brien, who replaced Jay Leno as host of ""Tonight"" for seven months until he was pushed aside in 2010, chose to joke about Passover and the Pope instead of his former employer, or the comedian who's now about to lose his high-profile gig on NBC to Jimmy Fallon.

"(CNN) -- Sheriff's deputies had been called to the home of Virginia state Sen. Creigh Deeds a day before the fight that left his son dead and the veteran politician with multiple stab wounds, investigators reported Wednesday. Deputies responded to a ""nonemergency call for assistance"" at Deeds' home in Millboro, in the rural western part of the state, on Monday, Virginia State Police said. The deputies made no arrests, and no charges were filed, the agency said. A police source confirmed that Deeds' son, Austin ""Gus"" Deeds, was taken to a local hospital under an emergency custody order for an evaluation by mental health professionals. The following morning, Deeds was stabbed multiple times during a fight with his 24-year-old son, who then shot himself with a rifle, according to autopsy results state police disclosed Wednesday. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Tuesday that the younger Deeds had been given a mental health evaluation under an emergency custody order. But Dennis Cropper, executive director of the Rockbridge Area Community Services Board, said that Austin Deeds had been released because no psychiatric bed could be found for him across a wide area of western Virginia, the newspaper reported. But three hospitals in the area told CNN Wednesday that they had beds available, and no one called them. All three are within an hour or two of the Deeds family home in Millboro, about 150 miles west of Richmond. Mental health: Warning signs parents can't ignore . Virginia law requires doctors to find a bed for a patient under an emergency custody order within four hours or release them. Sources close to the investigation told CNN that Deeds, the 2009 Democratic nominee for governor, was stabbed more than 10 times. He was in good condition Wednesday afternoon the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville. A cousin found the bleeding lawmaker walking down a road near his home after the fight and called for help, state police said. State troopers who went to Deeds' home found Gus Deeds suffering from a gunshot wound and were unable to save him, state police said Tuesday. The incident stunned the political community in Virginia, where Deeds is a well-known lawmaker who ran for attorney general and governor. The man who defeated him in both races, current Gov. Bob McDonnell, called Tuesday's events ""heartbreaking.""

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for a group of gay and lesbian couples in Utah have asked the Supreme Court to allow same-sex marriages to continue in the state, following a federal judge's ruling that found a law there banning the practice unconstitutional. Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued an emergency injunction on Tuesday, but was expected to issue an order as early as Friday afternoon on whether to grant the state's request for an injunction to temporarily halt same-sex unions. U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby struck down the statute as unconstitutional on December 20, and the state then asked the high court to block enforcement of that decision. Shelby said the law ""conflicts with the United States Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law."" The issue on enforcement is tricky since hundreds of marriage licenses have already been issued by some Utah counties in the nearly two weeks since the decision was announced. Voters there approved a law banning same-sex marriage in 2004. Any action from the high court on the enforcement question would be temporary and not offer the final word on the constitutionality of the state's ban on same-sex marriage. A Denver-based federal appeals court will take up the larger issues on an expedited basis in coming weeks, but in the meantime has allowed those marriages to continue.","Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued injunction on Tuesday .

"Valdosta, Georgia (CNN) -- New surveillance video released Wednesday in the case of a Georgia teen found dead inside a rolled-up gym mat raises more questions than it answers. There were 36 cameras inside and outside the gym of Lowndes High School in Valdosta, where the body of Kendrick Johnson was discovered. The video was released as a result of legal action, filed by his family, that CNN joined. Johnson's family suspects the 17-year-old was murdered and that someone has tried to cover up evidence in the case. One clip shows Johnson in the gym. A second shows him walking in, then running out of the frame. In both videos, students suddenly appear. Federal prosecutor will look into Kendrick Johnson case . An attorney for Lowndes County Sheriff Chris Prine said the video was not altered or edited by anyone within the sheriff's office. An attorney for the school likewise said that what was provided to the sheriff's office was the raw feed, with no edits. A third clip, which shows students playing in the gym and the mats where Johnson's body was found, is blurry. ""There are so many questions yet unanswered. As we've said before, this is a real-life murder mystery and there just seems to be more and more adding to the mystery,"" Benjamin Crump, a family attorney, told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""His parents have always said, all they want to know is the truth. And this video tape seems to tell us that the truth has not come out yet -- almost as if something was done with this one video to help conceal the truth.

Last week, a prosecutor said federal authorities will investigate the circumstances behind the death of Johnson, whose body was found on January 11. The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office had declared the death accidental. While warning his jurisdiction is limited as a federal prosecutor, Michael Moore, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said after lengthy review of evidence collected by authorities and the family's own investigator ""sufficient basis exists"" to warrant a formal review of the facts.

"(CNN) -- When fans approach Mike Tyson for photographs, they don't want the typical arm-around-the-shoulder celeb shot. Rather, they want the former world heavyweight champion to pose as if he's going to chomp their ear off. And he's OK with that. The former world heavyweight champion sat down with Rachel Nichols for a candid talk about his battles in an out of the ring with drugs and alcohol, and finally being at peace with his own life. Mike Tyson has been the fiercest fighter of his generation, done jail time, and even starred in a one-man show on Broadway. ""It's a big joke now,"" Tyson told Rachel Nichols of the infamous 1997 boxing match in which he bit off a portion of Evander Holyfield's ear. The incident disqualified him from the match and racked up fines and a host of legal woes for Tyson, whose bad-boy reputation had gone off the rails many a time. Both men starred in a recent Foot Locker commercial in which Tyson ""returned"" the ear, but he told Nichols that he is sincerely sorry. Nichols asked Tyson about the turning point in his career that was his cameo in the 2009 smash comedy film ""The Hangover."" ""For a lot of people 'The Hangover' movie was a real turning point,"" said Nichols. ""It was a very endearing performance."" Like his ""Hangover"" alter-ego, Tyson actually has had ""a few tigers"" as pets. ""You can't just throw them in the backseat like a dog, and have his head go out the window and go for a drive, right?"" inquired Nichols. ""You could,"" said Tyson, however ""they don't like the wind ... hitting them in the face."" ""So, you can go for a drive with your pet tiger,"" asked Nichols, ""just don't open the window?"" ""Well... just crack it a little bit,"" Tyson laughed. ""See, they pass gas."" In Tyson's earlier days, at the height of his boxing career in the late 1980s-early 1990s, he was knocking out his opponents at just 30 and 40 seconds into the game. Following what he described as a rough upbringing in Brownsville, Brooklyn, Tyson told Nichols he had been arrested more than 40 times by the time he was 12. But by 20 years of age, Tyson had become Heavyweight Champion of the World. ""Once you get there,"" asked Nichols, ""how difficult is it to deal with it?"" ""It gives you a false sense of security,"" Tyson told the CNN host. ""It makes you somewhat believe that you can't even die. And it turns you into a coward. This is what I know. People aren't born humble. Human beings have to be humbled in order to really appreciate the value of life."" Along with the fame and notoriety came great fortune. But the money came and went fast. ""I couldn't fathom the zeros,"" Tyson confessed. ""Just a lot of zeros... That money put a lot of demons in me. I'm not one of those guys that should have too much goodies and stuff. "" Chalking his monetary downfall to poor spending habits and managers who weren't looking out for his best interests, among other things, has inspired Tyson, now 47, to help young boxers avoid some of the pitfalls he fell prey to in his 20s in a new career turn as a boxing promoter. ""How are you doing it differently than the guys who promoted you?"" asked Nichols. ""I'll make sure my guys get their money at the end of the day,"" said Tyson, ""and they won't have to worry about that. They have to be responsible, like I wasn't. I wasn't a responsible fighter.","Mike Tyson is a guest on ""Unguarded"" with Rachel Nichols tonight at 10:30 p.m. ET on CNN .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy joined Muslim Brotherhood leaders at a Cairo court Saturday for a hearing, state-run Egypt News reported. Morsy faces several trials on various charges. Saturday's hearing was to address charges involving the deaths of protesters in 2012. Morsy is charged alongside 14 members of the Muslim Brotherhood. If convicted, they could face the death penalty. Saturday's was the third hearing to address these allegations. It was originally scheduled for early January, but rough weather conditions prevented the helicopter transporting Morsy from flying. Although lawyer Mohamed Selim El-Awa does not officially represent Morsy, he argued Saturday that the court does not have jurisdiction over the case under Egypt's new constitution. He added that once the court rules on his argument, he would announce to the court his intention to represent Morsy, who appeared last week in court in connection with an alleged 2011 jailbreak. El-Awa also argued that Morsy was still the president, and that as such, he has certain protections and procedures that must be followed to try him. However, the judge said he would rule on the argument that the case against Morsy is unconstitutional only after a verdict has been reached. He adjourned the case until next Tuesday. But it's still unclear who will officially represent Morsy as the case moves forward. Lawyer Sayed Hamed said he was assigned by the judge to represent Morsy, having been sent by Egypt's lawyers' syndicate to step in if Morsy doesn't delegate a lawyer. El Awa was only delegated to present Morsy's constitutional argument about the court's jurisdiction. When the judge announced he would deliver his decision about the argument with the final verdict, El-Awa said he wasn't sure he would represent Morsy or if the deposed President would give any lawyer powers of attorney. Denouncement . In last week's appearance, the nation's first democratically elected President denounced the process as unfair and unjust. Speaking from inside a soundproof glass enclosure, he demanded to know who was in charge. His lawyers told the judge that he was angry because he had not been allowed to see his attorneys or family. Jailbreak accusations . Nineteen Muslim Brotherhood members, including Morsy, allegedly broke out of prison in 2011, Egypt News reported. At the time, the Muslim Brotherhood was banned in the country. But the Islamist group became the nation's most powerful political force after longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak was toppled in February 2011. Morsy and dozens of co-defendants are accused of collaborating with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah to escape from Wadi-Natroun prison, the state-owned Ahram Online news agency said. The defendants are also accused of attempting to kill police officers, Ahram Online said. The Muslim Brotherhood views the trials as a sham and consider Morsy, who was ousted in a military coup, to be the legitimate leader of Egypt. CNN's Yousif Basil reported from Atlanta and Journalist Sarah Sirgany reported from Cairo. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Judge says he won't rule on the constitutionality of the case until after verdict is reached .

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania Methodist minister who was defrocked this week for performing a same-sex wedding said Friday he felt compelled to break church doctrine because it was an ""act of love"" for his son. When Frank Schaefer's son was in his teens, he was suicidal, torn by sadness that the church would think less of him for being gay, Schaefer said Friday on CNN's ""New Day."" When their son told his parents he was gay, the Schaefers recognized his pain and chose to embrace him. ""My wife and I said, 'Look, there's nothing wrong with you. This is the way you were created,' "" Schaefer said on ""New Day."" ""Obviously, he didn't choose this because he prayed to God to make him, quote-unquote, 'normal.' And when that didn't happen, he really went through this crisis,"" the minister explained. Years later, in 2007, Schaefer's son asked his father to perform his wedding. ""For me, to say no to him ... it would have denied everything we ever told him in terms of affirmations and love that we gave him,"" Schaefer said. The minister knew that performing the ceremony was going to stoke the ire of his superiors and that it was against church doctrine. So he was upfront with church officials. He told them. For six years, he didn't hear a word about the incident. Then, apparently, someone in the church filed a complaint about him this year. On Thursday, the minister at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in the small town of Lebanon was found guilty in a church trial for officiating his son's same-sex wedding, church officials said. The verdict came after a jury of 13 clergy members determined in November that the minister had been disobedient to the discipline and order of the church. After that determination came a 30-day suspension. The church asked Schaefer to decide whether his advocacy on behalf of the gay community would prevent him from fully complying with church law, according to a statement from Bishop Peggy Johnson of the United Methodist Church. The church told him that he could retain his standing if he never performed another same-sex wedding again. Schaefer refused, telling the Board of Ordained Ministry that he could not uphold the church's Book of Discipline in its entirety because it is discriminatory. That prompted the church to ask Schaefer to immediately surrender his credentials. He refused again, forcing church officials to defrock him. Losing his job shook the minister. ""Actually, I was in shock,"" he said on ""New Day."" ""I didn't realize it right away, but my wife told me, when we were in the car, she said, 'Look at your hand,' and I looked at it. I was shaking."" ""It really hit me harder than I thought,"" he continued. ""Look, I mean, six, seven years ago, I was ready to give up my career for my son. I never thought this would ever come back after that long of a time, so I went on ministering. I'm a pretty effective minister, so I never thought it would come to this. And especially not to the kind of attention that this has gotten nationwide."" The incident had received media attention across the globe. His son was recently interviewed, saying that he feels guilt for what has happened to his father, Schaefer said. ""I always tell him, 'Don't feel guilty about this. This really had nothing to do with you.' This is based on the exclusionary policies of the church. That's what causes this. We just have to stop the discrimination in the church."" The minister said that his views on homosexuality have evolved over the years. At one point, he believed that it was a sin. But when he went through seminary, he learned about ""different interpretations"" of scripture that addressed homosexuality. ""By the time my son came out, I would describe myself as tolerant,"" he said. But eventually, he became a ""silent supporter"" of his son, and once someone complained about the performance of his son's wedding, he decided to be vocal and open about his feelings. His church is divided, he said, and he's lost friendships. It has been a ""painful process."" But he wants to remain in the Methodist Church and work for change from within. He said he has already filed an appeal and hopes to become reinstated to the Methodist clergy. Schaefer's case will be reviewed by the appeals committee of the United Methodist Church's northeast jurisdiction. It could also go to the judicial council, which is equivalent to the supreme court of the church, according to Schaefer's attorney, Bill Ewing. The attorney expects the appeal to be heard in 2015.

El-Sisi has yet to announce whether he'll run, but the move by Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces essentially is an endorsement of him, said Ehab Badawy, a spokesman for Egyptian Interim President Adly Mansour. The council added in a statement to state television Monday night that it would be up to El-Sisi to decide, but that it considers his candidacy ""a mandate and an obligation."" Badawy said that El-Sisi, who was promoted from general to field marshal earlier Monday, would have to retire from the military before running for president. The interim government has not given a date for elections; candidates can officially declare themselves on February 18. El-Sisi, who was defense minister when the military ousted President Mohamed Morsy in July, had said he would run for president if the Egyptian people wanted him to, state media reported recently. The Arab world's most populous nation has seen months of political turmoil since the military deposed Morsy, of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood movement, on July 3 after mass protests against his rule. Demonstrators accused him of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. An interim, military-backed government was installed in Morsy's place, but Morsy's supporters have held near-daily protests since his ouster, demanding that he be reinstated. The protests often have devolved into violence. This month, Egyptians overwhelmingly approved a new constitution, with 98.1% in favor, the Electoral Commission said. But supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, which the interim government banned late last year, boycotted the referendum in response to the crackdown against it. Morsy was elected in 2012, a year after a popular uprising ousted longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak. Morsy's supporters say that he wasn't given a fair chance and that the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of Mubarak. CNN's Reza Sayah, Marie-Louise Gumuchian and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","NEW: Military council says choice is El-Sisi's, but it highly encourages his candidacy .

"(CNN) -- Call it odd, but I'm a self-appointed airport sleuth. I apply this title to travelers who weave their way in and out of airport terminals, bypassing lines, crowds and stress, and ultimately finding devilish gratification in knowing what others don't. As a longtime resident of Atlanta, I've passed through the world's busiest airport hundreds of times and have a few handy tricks that make life a bit easier, faster and more comfortable. It's not very sleuth-like of me to share my secrets, but my hope is you'll share yours, and together, we can expand our sleuth-like ways ... 1. If you're dropping off or picking up someone from the north or south side, use the downstairs entrance instead of the upstairs. There are check-in kiosks and baggage services below (south side only) and barely any lines or even cops to tell you to keep moving. It's guaranteed to save you time. Plus, you avoid the crowds and chaos above as you slip past the masses with ease. 2. There's a lesser-known security checkpoint with six lanes by the American check-in counter on the north side. Also, on the south side past Delta ticketing and the Brooks Brothers store, you'll see Delta's own set of four security lanes. If the main security is super busy, try either of these as a possible faster option, no matter which airline you're flying. Road warriors' best tips for smooth travel . 3. If you're lucky enough to be departing from the T Gate, enter through the side security lanes, (either north or south) and then walk to the T Gate. This is actually faster than going through the main security and taking the tram. I love the T Gate! 4. When heading to baggage claim after your flight arrives (from A, B, C, D or E terminals), be sure to board the very first car of the tram. This will let you out in front of the hordes of people now behind you and up the escalator to baggage claim first. Freedom! It's one of my favorite secrets, so shhh ... 5. Wi-Fi isn't free at the airport, unless you're at the E Terminal food court. Hojeij Branded Foods provides the free service that can help time slip on by. So if you have a long layover, take the tram to E Terminal, and maybe you'll have the added benefit of meeting a cute international man (or woman) of mystery. What airport sleuth wouldn't love that? 6. Exhausted from traveling, and have a long layover? Go to Minute Suites at B Terminal. Here, full-service secluded napping stations are offered for $30 an hour. Minute Suites was the first of its kind in the country. (Philadelphia International Airport is now the second.) Besides a daybed and blankets, each suite offers a high-definition television and workstation with a phone, desk, office chair and Internet. As soon as you find out your flight is delayed, be the sleuth that you are and leave your irked co-passengers behind in exchange for some quiet time with your feet up, door shut, blanket tucked and the TV tuned to ""Million Dollar Decorators."" (Oh, how I love that show.) This isn't the airline I signed up for . 7. Flying can be uncomfortable enough, so I believe in making airport time a bit indulgent. Concourse A (across from the food court) and C (opposite Gate C37) have an XPresSpa. Prices are $20 for a manicure or $25 for a 10-minute massage. Or grab an old-fashioned shoeshine offered at gates A20 and B17. A bit of glam goes a long way for the airport sleuth. 8. Sign up for Trak-a-Flight, the free service offered by Atlanta Airport that provides updated flight information to e-mail accounts, PDAs or mobile devices. This service provides instant access to any changes made to your flight. Knowledge is key if you want to take this title seriously. 9. Want to forgo fast food for a fine dining experience? Then head to the E Concourse and grab a seat at ""One Flew South."" A couple of entree highlights are Thyme Roasted Pork Belly and Fennel and Coriander crusted Lamb Tenderloin. The restaurant also has an excellent sushi menu. For dessert, I suggest the sublime red wine and ginger-poached plums that make you forget you're at an airport. Or if you're just in need of a scrumptious cocktail, saddle up to the bar for the ""Portrait of a Bartender,"" made with Finian's Irish Whiskey, St. Germain Elderflower and organic bitters. That delicious Elderflower makes me sigh with happiness every time. MatadorNetwork: Tips for speaking English abroad . Have some secret tips to share in navigating ATL or your own hometown airport?

"(CNN) -- Dutch international striker Robin van Persie has turned down a new contract at Arsenal, signaling his likely departure from the English Premier League side. Van Persie made the announcement Wednesday on his official website. The 28-year-old has only a year left on his remaining deal and Arsenal will likely have no option than to transfer him rather than see him depart on a Bosman free transfer. ""I've thought long and hard about it, but I have decided not to extend my contract,"" Van Persie said. ""You guys, the fans, have of course the right to disagree with my view and decision and I will always respect your opinions,"" he added. Van Persie is considered key to Arsenal's hopes of improving on their distant third place finish in the EPL last season behind Manchester City and Manchester United. He scored 37 goals in 48 games for the Gunners last season, including 30 in the Premier League. His efforts also won him the two major player of the year awards in English football, but van Persie said he was keen to win trophies. He has just the 2005 FA Cup win to show for his time with Arsenal since his transfer from Dutch side Feyenoord in 2004. To this end, van Persie said he had met with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and the chief executive Ivan Gazidis at the end of last season to discuss his future and their ambitions for the club. ""Out of my huge respect for Mr. Wenger, the players and the fans I don't want to go into any details, but unfortunately in this meeting it has again become clear to me that we in many aspects disagree on the way Arsenal FC should move forward,"" he added. ""I am very proud of being part of this fantastic club for the last eight years. As soon as Mr.Gazidis is back from his two-week holiday in America further meetings will follow and I will update you if and when there are more developments."" Van Persie has been heavily linked with a move to EPL champions Manchester City, while Serie A winners Juventus are also believed to be keen on his signature. He would be the most notable departure from Arsenal since Spanish star Cesc Fabregas left last summer to join Barcelona.","Robin van Persie says he does not want to extend contract at Arsenal .

"(CNN) -- Why not use those last few vacation days? Given an average of 14 annual vacation days, Americans left four days on the table over the past year, according to Expedia.com's 13th annual vacation deprivation study. That's twice as many as the previous year. ""No one retires wishing they'd spent more time at their desk,"" said John Morrey, Expedia's vice president and general manager, in a statement. ""There are countless reasons that vacation days go unused -- failure to plan, worry, forgetfulness, you name it. But rested employees are more productive employees, so taking regular vacations may well help the company more than failing to do so."" Workers around the world cite a variety of reasons for not using those days. Some 25% say they like to stockpile days for possible trips in the future. Other reasons include difficulty of scheduling vacations (22%), getting paid for unused days (18%), worry they can't afford a vacation (16%) and failure to plan (15%). But 8% point the finger not at themselves and instead at the atmosphere of their workplaces, saying they resist using their allotted days off because taking vacation days may be viewed negatively. These figures and more were determined by Harris Interactive, which conducted this survey online from August 20 to September 12 in North America, Europe, Brazil and the Asia-Pacific region. In all, 24 countries were included, and 8,535 working respondents over age 18 took part. People had to be employed full time, part time or be self-employed. Americans aren't the most vacation-deprived citizens. That honor goes to both Japan and South Korea. South Koreans take seven out of 10 vacation days, while Japanese workers take seven out of 18 vacation days. Worldwide, working people get an average of 20 vacation days. The French top the scale in vacation days, getting 30 off each year and -- get this -- taking all of them. Even so, 90% agree with the phrase, ""I feel vacation deprived"" despite the fact that they and other Europeans get more vacation time than most others. Even though they have fewer vacation days than the French, some 59% percent of Americans feel vacation deprived. Norwegians are much less likely to pout about their lack of vacation time: Seventeen percent say they feel vacation deprived. Fewer than half of those from the Netherlands (41%), Denmark (39%) and Mexico (38%) feel the same way. Once people do vacation, how successful are they at letting go? Nearly half of those surveyed say they leave work behind ""as soon as I leave on vacation,"" while 20% do when they arrive at their vacation destination. Only 10% can ""never"" truly relax while away. Yet 67% of Americans remain connected to their offices via e-mail or voice mail, they say. More than 90% of French, Indian, Thai and Mexican travelers stay connected. That so many French workers stay connected to the workplace while away may -- or may not -- serve as consolation to others.","Americans will not use four vacation days this year, study says .

"Cupertino, California (CNN) -- After Apple unveiled a pair of new iPhones Tuesday, Tim Cook & Co. made the phones briefly available for some hands-on (and fingers-on) testing. Several hundred bloggers and other guests -- including musician Elvis Costello, who had been invited by Apple to play a few songs -- were ushered to a nearby room to handle the phones. I got to spend some time playing with both devices. An in-depth review will have to wait, but here are my first impressions. Design of the iPhone 5S . The body of the iPhone 5S is the same shape andt design at the iPhone 5, but the company has rolled out some new color options. The rumored golden iPhone is real, and a very classy champagne shade of fake gold. The face of the phone is all glass over the screen and surrounding white frame, while the muted gold is only visible on the sides and back. The 5S also comes in silver and another new color Apple is calling ""space gray."" The gray iPhone is the only one in the 5S lineup that has a black faceplate instead of white. Fingerprint sensor . The most intriguing new hardware feature on the 5S is the fingerprint sensor in its Home button. It doesn't replace the old pass code and can even be turned off. The phone can be unlocked by using either a fingerprint or the code, so if you hand a friend your phone while you're driving, you can just tell them what number to enter. Each phone can record up to five individual fingerprints -- say one for each member of the family you don't mind using it (maybe purposefully leaving out the kids). To add a new print, you first must enter your security code. Pick a finger, preferably the one you use most to press the Home button. For most people, this will be their thumb. To record a print, you place your finger on the home button until it vibrates and then lift and repeat. This goes on for a number of times as it gets a full image of the finger. It also grabs a few impressions of the sides of your finger for a complete picture. To open the phone with a fingerprint, you press the Home button down as usual but then keep the finger on the small circle. It will automatically skip the pass code screen and take you to the home screen. You also can use a fingerprint to pay for purchases from the App Store or iTunes. It worked seamlessly when I tested it, though adding new profiles takes a bit of time. But it's a much faster way to open the phone than entering a pass code, and there is no ""reading your print now"" type of delay on screen. Camera . The new camera on the iPhone 5S is packed with a number of legitimately cool new features, the result of software and hardware improvements. The new burst mode, which takes rapid-fire photos at a rate of 10 per second, is meant for capturing moving subjects such as twitchy children or sprinting athletes. I took 40 shots in four seconds -- so many that scrolling through them created a neat time-lapse video effect. You can dig through all 40 images yourself to find the winners, but Apple has added a feature that identifies what it thinks are the best in the bunch automatically based on things such as exposure, blur and if the subject's eyes are open. Out of the 40 images, two were highlighted with a small gray dot. In the camera roll, the burst photos were lumped together in one pile so I could easily delete all the extras after I picked my final shots. With another new feature, I tried making a slow-motion video. The camera can record 120 frames per second, which is helpful for slowing down and stretching out detailed scenes. You scroll to the Slow-Mo setting before shooting the video. After the clip is recorded, you choose what section of it to slow down. The final video looked impressively professional, even though it was just of tech bloggers milling about a room. The room was a bit too bright to accurately test out the new flash. Apple claims the flash will automatically adjust color and intensity depending on the subject and lighting situation. It has two different colored LED lights instead of the usual one. A better flash would be a welcome improvement over the traditional LED flashes on iPhones (and most other smartphones) that flood scenes with harsh light. Graphics . The faster processor inside the 5S means everything is zippier, including the graphics. This is the case with every new iPhone, so it's hard to tell how much of an upgrade this one is. But the high-end game apps did look rich. Apple is calling the new graphics ""console level,"" so next time we'll have to test it head to head with an Xbox. iPhone 5C . The lower-priced iPhone 5C doesn't have as many fancy new hardware features. Instead, its pizazz is mostly on the outside. Apple rounded the corners down and encased the 5C in a smooth hard plastic shell instead of metal. Plastic has a reputation of being cheap and breakable, but Apple is pitching this as high-end plastic. Apple design head Jony Ive even says, ""The iPhone 5C is beautifully, unapologetically plastic."" The polycarbonate body does feel sturdier than other plastic phones, and the phone still has bit of weight to it. The entire back side of the phone is one seamless piece of plastic and comes in blue, green, pink, yellow and white. The colors look subdued in press images, but in person the green and pink are a bit more fluorescent and bright. Apparently Apple didn't think one super bright color was enough, so it also created a line of $29 soft silicon shells for the 5C. The blue, green, pink, yellow, black and white cases have a grid of holes in the back so you can see the original shade of the 5C through them as lines of dots.","CNN's Heather Kelly spent a few minutes with new newly launched iPhones Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- There's nothing like a beautiful winter scene to get you in the mood for Christmas, and the following sights are some of the most spectacular. Neuschwanstein Castle, Bavaria, Germany . If this beautiful castle looks familiar, don't be surprised, because Neuschwanstein inspired Disney Land's Sleeping Beauty castle. It's perched on a rocky outcrop high above the Bavarian village of Hohenschwangau and more than 60 million people have visited since it was opened to the public in 1886. King Ludvig used his personal fortune to build the castle to avoid spending public funds, and for two decades the construction site was the area's principle employer. ""Surrounded by the majestic Alps and pristine Bavarian Forests, King Ludwig II's enchanting Neuschwanstein is the world's most picturesque castle, mesmerizing onlookers' minds and transporting them into a fairy tale dreamland,"" says photographer Sheri Vitullo, founder of sherivitullophotography.com. ""It is, in the words of Ludwig II, 'a true blessing to the world.'"" How to get there: The castle is a short walk from the center of Hohenschwangau village, which is 75 miles from Munich.

Diana's Baths are a series of small waterfalls on the edge of Bartlett, a town in New Hampshire. This historic site is protected by the U.S. Forest Service and is located within the White Mountain National Forest. The pools are fed by Lucy Brook, which was named after the Lucy family who operated a sawmill next to the stream in 1892. ""What I find so enchanting about Diana's Baths is the multi-layered nature of the cascading falls,"" explains photographer Shawn Brace. ""Between the ledges, pools, and rock formations there's endless beauty for the curious mind and hungry eye."" How to get there: Diana's Baths are located on the outskirts of the village of Barlett, 14 miles from the town of North Conway in New Hampshire.

Jigokudani Yaen-koen has it all -- steaming hot springs, beautiful snow-covered landscapes and impossibly cute (and snow-covered) monkeys. The Joshinetsu-Kogen National Park is buried in snow for a third of the year, and although the clouds of steam rising from the springs, combined with the dramatic, steep cliffs, have led locals to nickname this area ""hell valley,"" the Japanese macaques (known as snow monkeys) certainly love it here. ""Winter time is when Jigokudani Yaen-koen becomes really special,"" says photographer Jasper Doest, founder of jasperdoest.com. ""When the outside temperatures drop below freezing and thick layers of snow cover the mountains the hot springs attract many macaques who come here to enjoy an ""onsen"" in this surreal world of fog and snow."" How to get there: The park lies to the north of the city of Nagano, which is a 90-minute train journey from Tokyo. More: Gratuitous photos of monkeys in hot springs . Aiguille du Midi, French Alps, France . Aiguille du Midi translates as ""needle of noon."" The mountain gets its name from its tapered shape but also from the fact that if you view it from Chamonix, it's approximately noon when the sun passes over the summit. For the best views, take the TÃ©lÃ©phÃ©rique de l'Aiguille du Midi to the summit. This cable car was the world's highest when it was built in 1955. You'll ascend 9,186 feet (2,800 meters) in 20 minutes and from the top the views over the Swiss, French and Italian alps are incredible. On a clear day, it's possible to see the Matterhorn on the border between Switzerland and Italy. ""The Aiguille du Midi is an amazing place,"" says photographer Colin Woods, founder of colinwoodsphotography.co.uk. ""The real beauty of it is the fact that it is one of the few places where the non-climber can get an idea of the high altitude world that is normally only accessible to the alpinist. ""At 12,476 feet above sea level, it's an airy summit on which the visitor is perched between two worlds. On one side, far below, is the comfortable world of Chamonix town. On the other is the beautiful but hostile world of eternal ice, of glaring sun and blinding wind driven snow, giant glaciers and granite spires."" How to get there: Take the Aiguille du Midi cable car from the resort of Chamonix, which is 49 miles from the city of Geneva. More: Europe's best budget ski resorts . Tallinn, Estonia .

The narrow streets are lined with old warehouses, churches and barns, many of which date back to the 11th century. ""There is something about the light in Tallinn, says photographer Paul Adams, founder of padams.co.uk. ""It's amazing, almost Mediterranean but not -- I can't quite put my finger on it.

NASA experts believe the current period of solar activity will reach its peak in December, making this month the best time to spot the Northern Lights. The lights can be seen from Alaska, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Canada, Russia and Scotland, but visitors who head to northern Norway stand the most chance of spotting them, thanks largely to the lack of light pollution and dry weather. The northern lights belt first hits the Lofoten Islands and follows the coast all the way up to the North Cape. ""In a nutshell, I think that the Auroras are spectacular not just because of the fact that they are one of our planets' most amazing and awe-inspiring natural phenomena, but also because of the fact that they are ever changing,"" says Andy Keen from aurorahunters.org. ""No one aurora is the the same as another, which makes them completely unique. Viewing the Northern Lights is somewhat like looking through a kaleidoscope -- they're captivating, mesmerizing and free-spirited."" How to get there: The northern lights can be viewed from several countries, but this year, visitors to Reykjavik in Iceland, Kiruna in Sweden and Tromso in Norway stand the best chance of spotting them.

In winter, the remote Yorkshire Dales in northern England transform into a bleak yet somehow welcoming swathe of hills and fields, with church spires, cozy, glowing pubs and the occasional sheep jutting out of the blanket of snow. You might even catch a glimpse of the North Yorkshire Steam Railway, which runs from Pickering to Whitby. Wharfedale, with its picturesque hamlets and rock-strewn hills, is one of the most beautiful areas, and the limestone crags of Malhamdale are equally spectacular. ""I have always felt a strong attraction to the unspoiled purity of the Yorkshire Dales,"" says photographer Chris Ceaser, founder of chrisceaser.com. ""During winter months this feeling of peacefulness is compounded by the arrival of the snows which add a sense of isolation, making the photographer feel at one with his surroundings."" How to get there: The Yorkshire Dales are located 243 miles from London, or 65 miles from Manchester. One of the area's largest towns is Richmond, which is well connected to most of the UK's cities by rail. More: Britain's oldest pub -- who deserves the crown?

When the weather's right, what's known as a cloud inversion can take place. The clouds below become locked within the valley and visitors on the summit can look down upon a sea of white. ""Winter in Whitefish is so magical probably because the mountain weather is so dynamic and extreme,"" says Brian Schott at Whitefish, Montanta Visitors' Bureau. ""Winter storms race in from the west coast and bump up along the continental divide, sitting over us for days dumping snow.

"(CNN) -- Hans Zimmer, the creative force behind some of Hollywood's best loved film music, including the Oscar-winning Lion King score, adjusts his chair in front of a sleek black instrument that looks something like the control panel of a stealth bomber. He raises his hands to the monochrome keyboard and presses gently. A familiar strain emerges from it: the opening lines of the Dark Knight theme, but today it sounds unlike it has ever sounded before. The 'Seaboard keyboard' is a tech forward interpretation of the piano, that attempts to reimagine what a keyboard can do. To test the device, CNN invited Zimmer to cast an expert eye over the British invention, and give a frank assessment of how it works. ""The Seaboard is really interesting,"" Zimmer says, ""because you're forever trying to figure out how to make music more expressive. I've always been involved in music and technology and this is quite a relationship we're developing here ... we're trying to figure out how to get beyond the boundaries of technology that was invented 600 years ago or so."" Developed in the UK, the Seaboard is the brainchild of multi-instrumentalist inventor Roland Lamb. While studying at the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London, Lamb decided to create a new keyboard that he hoped would be more expressive than the piano. ""The piano was the first object I truly loved,"" Lamb says. ""I played it all growing up ... but I became frustrated with its inability to modulate the timbre, and pitch and volume of each note. Essentially I was jealous of guitar players who could bend notes at will on a single note."" The Seaboard takes the basic layout of a piano but allows a player to 'bend' the sound of each note by using a range of different gestures that Lamb says are based very closely on the gestures people learn when they first pick up the piano. Moving a finger left on a key makes a note 'bend' downwards. Moving it right makes it go up a little. Lamb believes that this opens up the expressive potential of the instrument, and serves to counter the ""direct and unbending"" nature of notes played on a piano. Zimmer says that in this respect, Lamb has been successful: ""It behaves much more the way you imagine as a human being you would want to interact with your notes. It doesn't have that stiff 'plunky' thing that a piano has. It automatically has a sort of sensuality to it ... Look, if Debussy or Ravel had had one of these I think their music would have been X-rated."" The invention of an unusual instrument is nothing new of course. Earlier this year a device called the Artiphon came out, aiming to bridge the gap between guitar, keyboard and violin. Typically, new instruments have struggled to gain widespread traction, but some have been adopted by working musicians, such as the Swarmatron used by Trent Reznor on the Social Network soundtrack or the Reactable which, for a period, Bjork used in her live shows. Lamb says he would love to see a Seaboard in the hands of Herbie Hancock or Vangelis, but that seeing it played by Zimmer was a particular thrill. Lamb says that all of Zimmer's feedback was useful, but he was most surprised by the German composer's interest in the Seaboard's tactile qualities: . ""One of the most surprising pieces of feedback that I got from Hans was his emphasis on the importance of the touch. I've always known that the touch is kind of the core part of the Seaboard ... but he wanted to just go back and focus on the simplicity and the beauty and the expression of the touch and that was a really nice reminder to me of what was of the greatest importance."" The Seaboard goes on sale this week. CNN's Monique Rivalland takes a look at other unusual instruments piquing the interest of musicians around the world: . The Reactable . Music can be heard, felt and with the Reactable it can also be seen. Mostly used in live music production, the Reactable allows musicians to compose tracks by tweaking a series of objects placed on a multi-touch screen. Those motions then trigger real-time changes in the music as well as a visual feedback that means you can 'see' the song. Anton Funer, who forms part of a live techno act called Klangmechanik, says that the physicality of the Reactable ""allows us to act on our intuitive musicality."" He says: ""When I'm playing my songs, it's like I'm arranging the instruments of a band. Then I can build variations and mix it all together on the table surface in real-time. ""The visual feedback means you can actually see the music and it's also easy for the audience to understand what I am doing and connect to what I am playing."" Although Funer does admit that it has some glitches: ""One problem with the Reactable is that sometimes objects connect to each other by mistake, which can lead to loud interferences in your track."" The Fingerboard Continuum . An instrument not unlike the Seaboard, the Fingerboard Continuum by Haken Audio has a similar structure to a keyboard but allows you to play multiple notes at once and have ""integrated"" control over pitch, volume and timbre. Rob Schwimmer, an American composer and pianist who has worked with a number of high profile musicians ranging from Stevie Wonder to Chaka Khan, has recently recorded on the Continuum for Paul Simon. ""The Continuum blew my mind in that it is sort of a fabulous hi-speed collision between a piano and a Theremin and yet something totally unique and totally expressive. Also the sounds that have been painstakingly designed specifically for the instrument are gorgeous!"" says Schwimmer. See Schwimmer perform a version of ""Because"" by The Beatles. The Swarmatron . It has a funny name and it looks ancient but in fact there has never been an electronic instrument quite like it. ""Eight analogue oscillators hum slightly out of tune with each other, which is the reason for the name: the discordant chaos sounds like being in the middle of a swarm of bees,"" explains Roger Cordell from Big City Music, who are the main distributors of the Swarmatron. ""The artist can control the color, intensity and direction of the swarm with an array of controls, but never to perfection, so working with the Swarmatron is always an adventure."" Fans include Trent Reznor, who used it for the soundtrack to The Social Network and British producer Dan Carey, who has worked with big name artists including Franz Ferdinand, Hot Chip and most recently, Emiliana Torrini. ""It's such a sensitive piece of equipment that when you manipulate the controls there are almost an infinite number of harmonies. I've never heard anything like it before. The noises it makes are completely unique and otherworldly,"" says Carey. Carey's label Speedy Wunderground, on which he records tracks in just one day, has 10 commandments. Rule number seven is: ""Somewhere on each record the Swarmatron will make an appearance.""

"London (CNN) -- Celebrity chef Nigella Lawson spoke out angrily Friday against what she said were false claims of habitual drug use made against her in the trial of two former personal assistants. Sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo were each cleared of fraud Friday by the jury in the London court that heard the case. Francesca Grillo had been accused of defrauding Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi of 580,000 pounds ($950,000), and Elisabetta Grillo of defrauding them of 105,000 pounds ($172,000). Both had denied the charges. The case has gripped UK media, thanks to revelations of drug use by Lawson and insights into her troubled marriage to Saatchi, a millionaire art collector. The couple divorced this year. Lawson, who was a prosecution witness, said she was ""disappointed but unsurprised"" by the verdict, and she slammed what she said was a sustained campaign to ruin her reputation. ""Over the three week trial the jury was faced with a ridiculous sideshow of false allegations about drug use which made focus on the actual criminal trial impossible,"" she said in a prepared statement. ""My experience as a witness was deeply disturbing. When false claims about habitual drug use were introduced I did everything possible to ensure the (Crown Prosecution Service) was aware of the sustained background campaign deliberately designed to destroy my reputation."" 'Maliciously vilified' Lawson called for reform to the judicial system to allow witnesses to rebut false claims against them. ""I did my civic duty, only to be maliciously vilified without the right to respond,"" she said. ""Even more harrowing was seeing my children subjected to extreme allegations in court without any real protection or representation. For this I cannot forgive the court process."" Nigella Lawson admits using cocaine, denies drug problem . The TV chef said she had voiced her regret during the trial about having to talk about the end of her 10-year marriage. She said she'd also expressed concern about ""a campaign to circulate false allegations"" over the course of the past summer and eventually in court, as part of the sisters' defense. ""That concern remains,"" she said. At the trial, both sisters claimed to have seen signs of repeated cocaine and cannabis use by Lawson. However, both testified that they had never seen her take drugs. Saatchi likewise said he had never seen his ex-wife use drugs. Elisabetta Grillo told the court that Lawson had smoked cannabis with her two children from her marriage to her first husband, the late John Diamond. In her own testimony, Lawson confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times, during two periods of her life, and used cannabis in the past. But she denied being a habitual user. London's Metropolitan Police Service said Friday that it had no plans at this stage to investigate allegations of drug use made at the trial. The decision could be reviewed if any evidence that could be investigated comes to light, it said. Nigella Lawson: Flirtatious celebrity chef . 'Long, hard fight' Neither defendant was in the dock Friday to hear the verdict because of Elisabetta Grillo's ill health. Richard Cannon, a lawyer for the sisters, gave a statement on their behalf outside court. ""This has been a long, hard fight played out in the gaze of the world's media,"" he said. ""Elisabetta and Francesca would like to thank friends and relatives for their love and support and members of the public who expressed their best wishes."" Cannon said Elisabetta was ""very well."" The two sisters still face a civil case brought by Saatchi. In summing up, the judge told the jury that they must weigh up whether the prosecution had proved in the case of each of the sisters that they had acted dishonestly and knew they were acting dishonestly. The defense argued that the sisters had explicit and implicit authorization for their personal expenditure. During the trial, the Italian sisters told Isleworth Crown Court in west London that Lawson authorized their personal expenditures on Saatchi's company credit cards, including on designer shoes, clothes and trips abroad. Both defense lawyers questioned Lawson's credibility as a prosecution witness and said their clients' claims that she repeatedly used drugs were relevant to that issue. Jane Carpenter, giving the prosecution's closing argument in the case, said Thursday that the sisters had abused their position ""time and time again"" and that they ""grew bolder and greedier"" as time went by. The prosecution outlined dozens of transactions that it said were unauthorized by Saatchi or Lawson.

"(CNN) -- In early September my iPhone 5 fell off the roof of my Jetta wagon. The Jetta was traveling at highway speeds when it happened. I'd placed and forgotten the iPhone on the roof of the Jetta before driving off — something I'd done repeatedly with inexplicable witlessness in the past, though I somehow managed not to lose the phone on those earlier jaunts. Not so this time. I imagine the phone hurtling off the top as I rounded the bend (that I eventually found it lying beside) like a James Bond special deploying chaff (thankfully no one was behind me, and the phone wound up on the shoulder, though it may have been run over first). I was able to track it down a few hours later after I realized it was missing by using my wife's iPhone and the freebie Apple app Find My Friends. When I went to the local Apple Store to see what my options were, Apple offered me a choice: repair the screen right then and there in under an hour, or swap it for a brand new phone. The cost to swap for a new phone was $229, or just a little more than I paid for the phone outright on contract. The cost to repair the screen was $149: $99 for AppleCare plus $49 for the screen replacement. I chose to replace the phone outright, because it nearly a year old, I'm on contract and so wouldn't have been eligible to upgrade to the iPhone 5s (then unannounced, but presumptive), I didn't have AppleCare and I figured the fresh battery I'd get with a new iPhone 5 was worth the bargain. Which is all a longish way of saying that Apple's been offering iPhone repairs in-store for some time — and it looks like that repair program's about to expand significantly. 9to5Mac reports that Apple may be planning to offer additional in-store repairs that go well beyond the iPhone 5′s screen. Note that my phone's glass was cracked, but the underlying area and componentry was unfazed. Had those parts been distressed, I assume my only option would have been full phone replacement. 9to5Mac's sources say Apple is rolling out ""special machinery"" to allow the stores to replace and calibrate the touchscreens on the iPhone 5s and 5c, and that the cost for such replacement would be $149. The other items on the list of in-store replaceable parts are said to include volume buttons, the vibration engine, the rear-camera, the speaker system and the Home buttons — though in the latter case, it sounds like not on the iPhone 5s, which employs a more sophisticated Touch ID fingerprint button. The repairs should be free if you're covered under AppleCare, but you'll have to pony up if not — $79 for a new battery and $29 for Home button replacement, according to 9to5Mac's sources. When? 9to5Mac's sources say the machines are arriving in stores now, suggesting the program could launch soon. &copy 2012 TIME, Inc. TIME is a registered trademark of Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- Elan Gale, producer of ""The Bachelor,"" is under heat for his live-tweet-turned-hoax aboard US Airways over Thanksgiving weekend. His live tweets about a feud with a disgruntled passenger went viral and garnered him tons of attention and sympathy. Turned out the whole thing was made up. Gale admitted it on Twitter. Should Gale not have made up the woman in 7a whom he called Diane? Maybe. But then again he's in the creative industry. He's a writer. To me, what's more fascinating is how quick we are to jump on any interesting human interaction. Gale conceived of a short story on Twitter and it was so good that hungry media outlets seized on it and spread the story like wildfire. If Gale wanted publicity, he got it. If the media wanted a good and verified story, it should have done its job of fact-checking. Gale just happened to live-tweet a fiction. But the bigger issue is: Is it OK to live-tweet other people's conversations? Based on my own experiences, I'd say yes, to an extent. A few weeks ago, it was an unusually warm night in Brooklyn. I had a friend in town and we went up to the roof to enjoy the view. More groups of people came up and cluttered the smallish space. Suddenly a couple burst on to the roof. Simply put, they began breaking up on the roof, in front of everyone. It all seemed so familiar to me, the back and forth, the arguing between the couple. I'll tweet out what they're saying, I thought. I didn't think too much about it. It just seemed like a relatable situation. The breakup, #roofbreakup as it became known, started to pick up steam, and eventually went viral. I began to receive messages and tweets and e-mails from all over the world, with the overwhelming majority expressing their delight and joy in reading the tweet-sized transcript. But not everyone condones this behavior. Nisha Chittal, a social media content editor at MSNBC, posted an essay on Medium entitled, ""Please stop live-tweeting people's private conversations."" Chittal mentions my #roofbreakup, Gale's airplane feud (before it was revealed to be a hoax), a date someone overheard on Amtrak, and the time where Tom Matzzie overheard former NSA director Michael Hayden's phone conversation with reporters. Chittal says she believes it to be ""unethical and unfair to regular people to broadcast their lives to an audience against their will."" She's right in some ways. However, except in the case of Michael Hayden, the people in her examples are anonymous. They just as easily could have been fiction, as in the case of Gale's airplane feud, where the characters existed in an invented scenario to evoke people's sympathy. But there is no harm if a conversation with universal appeal is shared publicly as long as the people remain anonymous. For example, with my own live-tweeting of #roofbreakup, I didn't give any clues as to who the couple were. When sifting through the endless responses sent my way in the wake of #roofbreakup, time and time again I came across ""oh I've been there before"" and ""sounds like my last breakup."" The only explanation for the level of exposure that my #roofbreakup got is that people connected with the situation. It was gossiping in the 21st century, except instead of using specifics and pointing out the people, it remained ""guy"" and ""Rachel."" I didn't live-tweet a couple's private conversation; I live-tweeted any two people's breakup conversation. Technology is quickly changing our lives and we are adapting accordingly. It's so easy to communicate and share information and knowledge instantly. And now we have to deal with having private conversations in public spaces. But private and public are not always distinctly drawn lines. Sometimes the two mesh and things get blurry. As humans, we're intrigued with the lives of other people. When other people's lives parallel ours, we feel less alone in the world. The media knows this. Just as often as you read a headline about a natural disaster, you will see a headline about a personal disaster. Elaborate proposal videos go viral daily. Couples fighting in public get on YouTube. Go ahead and share the story you overheard on the street or cafe, just make sure to not give away the personal identities. A story with no specific names attached is no less fake than fiction. You may wonder: Did the #roofbreakup really happen? You can believe me or not, but I promise you it did. Had I witnessed the breakup on my roof five or six years ago, I would have told everyone I knew about the crazy exchange. I would have walked back into my apartment and re-enacted it for my then roommates, embellishing and recalling every line I possibly could. But I witnessed the breakup in 2013, and I communicated it in a way that seemed just as normal as any other. It just happens that I can tell the story to more people.

"(CNN) -- Former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley remained hospitalized early Sunday morning, two days after he fell ill. Daley, 71, was taken by ambulance to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago on Friday evening after he returned from a business trip to Arizona, the hospital said. Daley is in the hospital's intensive care unit for evaluation -- with his family by his side, the hospital said. A former state senator and county prosecutor, Daley was elected mayor in 1989, to complete the term of the late Harold Washington. He was re-elected over and over until he decided to not run for reelection in 2011. In all, he served a record 22 years as Chicago's mayor. His father, Richard J. Daley, also served as the city's mayor. President Barack Obama's former Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, succeeded the younger Daley. Since leaving public office, Daley has kept busy, including speaking engagements and as special counsel at a law firm.","Daley, 71, is in the hospital ICU for evaluation .

"(CNN) -- Two teenagers were killed and another wounded during a Christmas night shooting in Newark, New Jersey, authorities said Thursday. The shooting came less than 24 hours after three men were shot to death early Christmas morning outside a bar about a mile away, authorities said. The teens, identified as 13-year-old Zainee Hailey and 14-year-old Kasson Mormon, were pronounced dead at the University Hospital in Newark, police said. A 14-year-old who was not identified was in critical condition, the Essex County prosecutor said. Junior Clark, a Newark resident, told CNN affiliate WCBS he saw the gunman minutes before gunfire erupted. ""I saw the guy with the gun under his arm, under his jacket,"" Clark told WCBS, ""I heard when he shot."" Authorities said the motive for the shooting was unknown. The investigation was being handled by Newark's homicide major crimes task force, which includes officers from the Newark State Police, the Sheriff's Office and the FBI. Earlier on Christmas Day, a few minutes away in Irvington, three men were shot and killed outside Slick's Go Go Bar. The dead included the bar owner's son -- identified as Pierre Clervoyant, 34 -- and nightclub employee Woodley Daniel, 32. The identity of the third victim, who authorities said appeared to be an unintended target, was not released. Two other men were shot and wounded, and their identities and condition were not released. All five men were transported to University Hospital shortly after 1 a.m., where Clervoyant and Daniel were pronounced dead. Authorities said an altercation between the bouncer and the gunman appears to be a catalyst in the shooting, but the motive was being investigated.","Christmas night shooting leaves two New Jersey teens dead, another wounded .

"(CNN) -- Malky Mackay was ""relieved of his duties"" as manager of Cardiff City Friday just 11 days after being told by the English Premier League club's Malaysian owner Vincent Tan he must resign or be sacked. A statement on the club's official website confirmed the fate of the 41-year-old Scotsman, adding that a new first team manager would be appointed in due course. The departure of Mackay was widely expected after his very public falling out with billionaire businessman Tan, who has had a controlling share in the Welsh club since 2010. Tan sent Mackay an email on December 16, with the resign or be sacked ultimatum. He criticized Mackay's signings and the team's style of play and said he would be given no further funds in the next transfer window. Tan's intervention infuriated Cardiff fans, who were out in force in matches against Liverpool and Southampton during the Christmas period to protest over their manager's treatment. After the 4-1 defeat to Liverpool, Mackay was given a brief reprieve when club chairman Mehmet Dalman said he would remain the manager for the ""forseeable future."" But the 3-0 home defeat to Southampton proved his final match in charge as he becomes the sixth EPL manager to depart this season. Mackay was appointed by Tan in the summer of 2011, a year after the Malaysian took control and success came on the pitch with an appearance in the 2012 English League Cup final at Wembley. Cardiff narrowly missed out in the playoffs to secure promotion, but made no mistake last season by winning the second-flight Championship. Off the field, while the Cardiff fans welcomed Tan's investment into the club, there were protests when he changed the club's traditional blue strip -- they are nicknamed the Bluebirds -- to red. The majority appear to have been behind Mackay during the recent saga and there were several ""Tan Out"" banners unfurled at the Southampton game. The defeat left Cardiff in 16th place, one point above the relegation zone and the new manager -- former Manchester United star Ole Gunnar Solksjaer is the early favorite -- will be judged on their ability to avoid the drop.","Cardiff City sack manager Malky Mackay .

"Washington (CNN) -- The four U.S. military personnel being held in Libyan government custody have been released, a U.S. Defense Department official said late Friday. The four were believed to be held by the ministry of the interior, the official, with knowledge of the situation, said on condition of anonymity. It was not immediately known why the American personnel were in Libyan custody. ""We are seeking to further ascertain the facts and ensure their release,"" the official said. The four were in Libya ""augmenting security at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli,"" the official said. A second person -- a senior U.S. official -- also told CNN that the four military personnel had been detained. That official also spoke on condition of anonymity. The news of the detentions followed an announcement by the United States last month that it was stepping up military support for Libya's fledgling security forces, who have been overwhelmed by militia violence and unrest since the overthrow of dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Popular sentiment against the various militias has been mounting for months in Tripoli and other parts of the country, including the eastern city of Benghazi, which has been gripped by increasing violence, including political assassinations. The chaos in Libya hit home for Americans after U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed on September 11, 2012, in an attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi. The United States has offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of anyone involved in that attack. While U.S. authorities have filed charges in the case, no one has been arrested. A NATO air campaign helped overthrow Gadhafi two years ago, but ever since there has been widespread unrest and poor security. The detention of the four personnel also followed reports of a U.S. military operation in October that saw members of the elite Army Delta Force launch a raid in Tripoli to capture Abu Anas al Libi, an al Qaeda operative wanted for his alleged role in the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa. Libya's interim government called the capture a kidnapping and demanded an explanation from Washington about the raid. Barbara Starr reported from Washington, and Chelsea J. Carter wrote from Atlanta; CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Four U.S. military personnel were believed detained by the interior ministry, an official said .

"(CNN) -- Mike Tyson has always relied on a fighter's instinct -- both in and out of the boxing ring. The American was once idolized as the youngest heavyweight champion of the world only to be swiped off his pedestal by criminal convictions and drug addictions. But at the age of 47, and long since retired from the ring, the provocative pugilist told CNN he is only now facing his biggest battle. ""Being responsible - that's going to be the most difficult fight in my life,"" Tyson told CNN's Rachel Nichols for her Unguarded series. ""I've never been responsible before. Just being a good husband and a good father. This is the biggest fight. This is the fight I'm taking with open arms."" Tyson, who is married to Kiki, his third wife, and has fathered eight children, is determined to focus on his family and a new generation of young boxers after a high-profile and controversial career. Fatherhood for the man dubbed ""Iron Mike"" is framed against his own experience as a shy kid turned street fighter growing up in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn. ""Drugs, thefts, gang infested, crime infested,"" Tyson recalled of his childhood neighborhood. ""No hope. ""To this day, I can't figure how from there, at that particular time, I made it to where I am now."" A teenage Tyson, by now spending time in a reform school, found an exit when his talents in the ring were spotted by respected trainer Cus D'Amato. At the age of 18, Tyson turned professional and was soon undefeated in 22 bouts. Two years later, in 1986, the young American knocked out Trevor Berbick to become the youngest heavyweight world champion in history. Tyson went undefeated for another four years but, with the benefit of hindsight, he now sees that heady era of fame and fortune very differently. ""I don't like that time in my life,"" Tyson continued. ""I didn't like the person I was back then. ""Even with all that money and all that success I had, I didn't get anything done. My kids never saw me. I was a horrible father."" There were more life lessons for Tyson when in 1992 he was found guilty of rape and sentenced to 10 years in prison. On his release, the Brooklyn boxer returned to the ring but controversy soon followed in the infamous ""bite fight"" against Evander Holyfield. During the duo's second heavyweight title bout in 1997, Tyson chewed off a chunk of Holyfield's ear. He was later served with a one-year boxing ban. But just as Tyson's reflections of the highs have changed over time, the same can be said of these low points. Commenting on the so-called ""bite fight"" Tyson said: ""Even though I was an undisciplined it was the only way I could get any kind of relief. ""I'm sad I bit his ear. I really am sorry because I like Evander, he's a good guy, a really good guy."" Of the rape charges, Tyson contemplated: ""That may cause more controversy in my life, but that's not the lowest moment of my life."" In his interview with Nichols, he describes the tragic death of his four-year-old daughter Exodus in 2009 as his nadir. The highlights for the 47-year-old Tyson, who is tentatively clean from his addictions, remain ahead. ""I'm accomplishing so much and getting so much done now as a human being, than I could've ever done back then in the prime of my fighting career,"" he explained. ""The best I am, and the best I've ever been, is right now. This is the best I'm going to ever be, compared to who I was before. "" Tyson retired from the ring in 2005 and has been fighting his way out of bankruptcy with a one-man Broadway show, cameos in Hollywood films and now as author of his autobiography ""Undisputed Truth."" There is also a new project that may bring his career full circle. Tyson, under the umbrella of Iron Mike Productions, is now working as a promoter for a batch of promising young boxers. ""I'll give them the best advice I possibly can,"" said Tyson. ""I'm just never gonna baby them. This is just what it is, you know. ""They have to be responsible, like I wasn't. I wasn't a responsible fighter."" Out of the ring, Tyson, with his trademark black tattoo arcing over his left eye, is looking for responsibility and perhaps even redemption at last.","Mike Tyson found fame as the youngest heavyweight world champion in 1986 .

"(CNN) -- It has been a good week for Barcelona's Neymar. He netted a hat-trick against Celtic in the Champions League and got both goals Saturday as Barcelona -- still without Lionel Messi -- beat Villarreal 2-1 to move three points clear of idle Atletico Madrid and five clear of arch-rival Real Madrid in Spain. Neymar, who will be counted on by Brazil at next year's World Cup on home soil, opened the scoring at the Camp Nou from the penalty spot in the 30th minute and tapped home the close-range winner in the 69th against the Yellow Submarine. He was teed up by Pedro, who latched on to Cesc Fabregas' sumptuous chipped ball. Villarreal, promoted last season, stunned the locals when it leveled in the 48th minute through Mateo Musacchio's header from a corner. Having clawed to within three points of Barcelona, Real Madrid earlier slipped up when it drew 2-2 at Osasuna. Yet it could have been worse for Los Blancos, who had defender Sergio Ramos sent off for two bookable offenses before halftime and trailed 2-0. With blockbuster summer signing Gareth Bale substituted in the second half and Cristiano Ronaldo held in check -- he failed to score for the first time since the end of October -- Isco began the Real comeback in first-half injury time. Pepe headed home the equalizer in the 80th minute seconds after Francisco Silva's red card for the host. ""The first 20 minutes were very good and it is incredible that we went 2-0 down and had 10 men,"" Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""We responded well but we suffered a lot. ""We were showing quality and rhythm and we lost control after the first goal but we did show character and the right attitude to battle back."" Atletico Madrid will move level on points with Barcelona if it beats Valencia at home Sunday. Bayern increases lead . Bayern Munich's 18-match winning streak at home ended in midweek when it was upset by Manchester City in the Champions League but Bayern bounced back by beating Hamburg 3-1 at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. Mario Mandzukic, Mario Gotze and Xherdan Shaqiri accounted for the Bayern goals, although manager Pep Guardiola wasn't fully satisfied with the performance ahead of the Club World Cup in Morocco. ""The players had perhaps their holidays and Morocco in their heads,"" said Guardiola. ""We had a few problems in the second half, like we did against Manchester. We simply gave away too many balls. We have good players, but we have to stop such things happening."" Bayern, which will conclude 2013 unbeaten in the Bundesliga, went seven points ahead of Bayer Leverkusen -- which plays fourth-last Frankfurt on Sunday -- and 12 ahead of Borussia Dortmund. A late goal against Marseille ensured Dortmund's progress to the second round of the Champions League but challenging Bayern in Germany now looks unlikely after a 2-2 draw at Hoffenheim. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Lukasz Piszczek rescued a point for injury-hit Dortmund, which trailed 2-0 within 40 minutes. Nurnberg remains the lone side in the division without a victory after it blew a three-goal lead and drew 3-3 at Hannover 96. In France, the big two of Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco both registered two-goal victories on the road -- over Rennes and Guingamp, respectively. Paris Saint-Germain leads Monaco by two points atop the table. Bayern's semifinal opponent at the Club World Cup on Tuesday will be Asian champion Guangzhou Evergrande, which beat Egypt's Al Ahly 2-0. ""We will now play against one of the best teams in the world,"" said Guangzhou manager Marcello Lippi. ""You can lose 99 times every 100 times you play them, but you could win one. You never know.""","Real Madrid rallies from two goals down to draw Osasuna 2-2 on the road .

"(CNN) -- Harvard is caught up in a student cheating scandal that its dean of undergraduate education calls ""unprecedented in its scope and magnitude."" As a Harvard grad, I am embarrassed, but what has me really worried is that Harvard, despite officials acknowledging the seriousness of what has happened, gives signs of trying to finesse the consequences of the scandal where key athletes are concerned. The scandal centers on 125 students, as many as half of them varsity athletes from the men's basketball, baseball and football teams, according to The Boston Globe. They stand accused of copying from one another or plagiarizing on a take-home exam in a spring 2012 government course, ""Introduction to Congress,"" with an enrollment of 279. At Harvard the standard penalty for cheating is that a student can be asked to withdraw from the university for a year. In the case of athletes, withdrawal means the loss of a year of athletic eligibility, according to the NCAA, if they are forced to leave after they have registered for classes. Harvard is seeking to avoid that problem. The secretary of Harvard's Administrative Board, the body that rules on individual cheating cases, sent around an internal e-mail to resident deans saying that fall athletes might ""consider taking [a leave of absence] before their first game."" The internal e-mail, obtained by The Crimson, Harvard's student paper, and confirmed by a resident dean, sends a clear message. You may be guilty of cheating, but here is a strategy for reducing the damage you suffer to a year's unpaid vacation. This advice may be Harvard's idea of academic integrity, but it certainly falls short of what a university should aim for. Fortunately, there is an example Harvard might learn from -- that of West Point, which in 1951 experienced a massive cheating scandal that involved a disproportionate number of athletes. On August 3 that year, West Point announced that it was expelling 90 cadets, including the son of its legendary football coach, Earl ""Red"" Blaik, for cheating on their exams by passing along answers. The West Point honor code is clear. It says, ""A cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do it,"" and West Point authorities upheld their honor code despite the consequences. News: Allegations of widespread cheating in government class probed at Harvard . Academy authorities did not try, as Harvard already has, to figure out a way to follow the letter of the law but make sure there was minimal damage to its athletic program. When fall football practice opened in 1951, Army, a national powerhouse in 1950, was able to muster a squad that included only 31 players; just two of whom were lettermen. ""I guess we can take a losing season,"" Blaik told the media. That is exactly what happened. Army, which in 1950 was ranked No. 2 in the nation, became a losing team in 1951, winning only two games while dropping seven. It became a team nobody feared, losing to Navy by 35 points in its final game of the season. Maj. Gen. Frederick Irving, the superintendent of West Point, did not back away from the academy's decision to expel the 90 cadets caught cheating. ""The man who cheats at West Point cheats every man who will graduate with him,"" Irving told those who complained he was acting too harshly. At West Point the origins of the cheating scandal were traced to a small group of football players, and at Harvard the most noteworthy early withdrawals from the school are those of the senior co-captains on the basketball team, which in recent years has been faced with troubling questions about its players and coach. Last season, after decades of fielding mediocre basketball teams, Harvard was ranked among the nation's top 25 in basketball, and at the heart of the basketball team's success was a program dogged by controversy ever since Harvard hired former University of Michigan coach Tommy Amaker in April 2007. Getting Amaker to come to Harvard was not easy. It required the Friends of Harvard Basketball, an alumni group dominated by ex-players. chipping in money to improve Amaker's salary, with, The Harvard Crimson reported, the full knowledge of Harvard's athletic director. Amaker then got himself into hot water by recruiting players with lower academic profiles than his predecessor had recruited. He was investigated for a possible violation of NCAA rules for allowing a coach, whom he would later hire as his assistant, to work out with a player Harvard was trying to recruit. A five-month Ivy League investigation into Amaker's recruiting practices cleared him of wrongdoing, but the tone was set for a sports program based on cutting corners and winning at all costs. Before the 2008 season began, Amaker called in five players the previous coach had recruited and told them there were no spots for them on the varsity team. Their basketball careers at Harvard were finished. The ball is in the court of Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust to deal with the basketball program and the cheating scandal. The author of the widely praised history, ""The Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War,"" Faust has been a welcome change from her predecessor, Larry Summers, Bill Clinton's secretary of the treasury and for two years director of the National Economic Council in the Obama administration. In contrast to Summers, who constantly alienated faculty with his imperious ways, Faust has carefully built consensus. As a result, everyone connected with Harvard gave her enormous leeway in her decision-making. Now, Faust's period of grace is over, thanks to the national publicity surrounding the cheating scandal. The future of an ethics-skirting basketball program is in the spotlight, and so are the teaching practices that led massive numbers of students to cheat in a course many originally took because it had a reputation for being easy. Whether Faust, who has said the accusations of cheating ""go to the core of what is most valuable to us,"" will show the backbone that Maj. Gen. Frederick Irving did 61 years ago is an open question. But the least she can do is set the bar higher than Harvard's secretary of the administrative board did by advising the university's athletes how to beat the system by minimizing the consequences of their cheating. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","Harvard is embroiled in a cheating scandal involving 125 students, many varsity athletes .

"(CNN) -- Like a combination of disinfectant and vomit. That's how a Royal Caribbean cruise passenger described the ship's smell after hundreds aboard fell ill. Shannon Blace had boarded the ship in Cape Liberty, New Jersey on January 21 for with her fiance and 10 other friends and family members. Of the 12, nine got sick, she said Monday night. One of the women in her group got sick twice. By Tuesday morning, the number had risen to 10 when her fiance fell ill and was ordered quarantined in his room, she said. It was supposed to have been a 10-day cruise. But the liner announced it was cutting it short by two days as a result of the outbreak. The atmosphere in the ship's usually bustling promenade deck was subdued on Tuesday. ""Everywhere you look, you see dreary sad faces,"" Blace said in a telephone interview. ""Just unhappy people everywhereâ€”waiting to get back to New Jersey."" In all, 622 of the 3,071 passengers and 50 of the 1,165 crew members became ill, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They reported vomiting and diarrhea. A CDC vessel sanitation program epidemiologist, a contract epidemiologist and an environmental health officer boarded the ship in St. Thomas on the U.S. Virgin Islands to study the outbreak and the response on the voyage back to Cape Liberty. Five specimens were sent Sunday to the CDC lab for testing. The cause of the illness was not clear, though the symptoms are consistent with norovirus, the cruise line said. Noroviruses spread easily and are a common cause of gastroenteritis, which produces vomiting and diarrhea. ""The number of reported new cases of gastrointestinal illness has dropped sharply after a spike in the first days of the cruise, and most guests who fell ill are up and about,"" the cruise line said Monday in a Monday. ""The drop in new cases is encouraging. However, it is not unusual in an outbreak to still have smaller, secondary spikes. That is why, after discussions with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and our medical team, we decided the most prudent course for the health of our guests and crew was to bring the cruise home on Wednesday, two days earlier than planned."" The company said all passengers would get a 50% refund and a 50% credit for a future cruise. Those passengers who were ordered quarantined to their rooms will get an additional credit of one future cruise day for each day in confinement, it said. After returning to home port on Wednesday, the ship will be cleaned ""to make certain that any remaining traces of the illness are eliminated,"" the liner said in a statement. ""Guests scheduled for the next cruise on Explorer of the Seas can be confident that all possible measures will have been taken to prevent further problems,"" it added. Explorer of the Seas departed Cape Liberty on January 21 for what was to have been a 10-day cruise. It had been scheduled to call to Labadee, Haiti; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas; and Philipsburg, St. Maarten. It missed port calls in Haiti and St. Maarten. CNN's Tom Watkins and Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","More than 20% of passengers report being ill, CDC says .

"(CNN) -- Divers are recovering bottles of champagne that have been lying at the bottom of the Baltic Sea for about two centuries, an autonomous Finnish island official said Wednesday. About 70 bottles lie mostly undamaged at 50 meters deep [roughly 164 feet] south of the Aland Islands. ""The first bottle was brought to the surface in mid-July,"" Rainer Juslin, permanent secretary of the island's ministry of education, science and culture, told CNN via telephone from Mariehamn, the capital of the Aland islands. ""We believe this is the oldest champagne in the world."" Juslin said that the cargo was aboard a ship believed to be heading from Copenhagen, Denmark, to St Petersburg, Russia, between 1800 and 1830. It could have possibly been sent by France's King Louis XVI to the Russian Imperial Court. ""Champagne of this kind was popular in high levels [of society] and was exclusive to rich groups -- it was not a drink for common people then,"" Juslin said. Juslin said some of the bottles already retrieved had some cracks and a few corks on the bottles had corroded, leaving the possibility open that ""salt water leaked into some bottles ... but for the undamaged bottles, they could be very high quality [champagne]."" Some of the bottles were originally produced by Juglar, a premium champagne house no longer in existence, according to Juslin. He said the cold sea water was a perfect way to store the vintage bubbly, with the temperature remaining a near-constant 4-5 degrees Celsius [around freezing temperature in Fahrenheit, or 32 degrees] and no light to expedite the spoiling process. ""This was the ultimate conditions for storage,"" Juslin said. ""And it would never freeze."" Juslin speculated the ship carrying the cargo may have been Finnish or another Scandinavian ship. The island chain is at the entrance of the Gulf of Bothnia, in the Baltic Sea, and is an island of Swedish speaking people, though the island itself falls under Finnish control. The islands form an archipelago of more than 6,000 skerries and islands.","About 70 bottles lie mostly undamaged south of the Aland Island .

"(CNN) -- The attorney for a woman who accused Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston of raping her called Friday for a state inquiry into how authorities handled the now-closed investigation into her allegations. In a news conference Friday, attorney Patricia Carroll accused the Tallahassee police detective who handled the case of spending time and resources investigating her client instead of Winston. ""I would characterize the investigation overall as an investigation into a rape victim as opposed to a rape suspect,"" Carroll said. She said more than half of the 248-page investigative file authorities released to her consisted of records related to her client's telephone, social media and other records. She said only 11 of the pages contain references to Winston, and said some of the files released by authorities differed from those obtained by the woman's family. Carroll also questioned how investigators handled and tested evidence in the case and said investigators failed to get warrants to examine video surveillance, Winston's apartment and other potential evidence that could have proven crucial to the case. ""You have a rape kit, you have physical evidence, you have blood in the underwear, you have semen, you have marks and bruises, you have a sprained back, some scrapes on the feet,"" Carroll told reporters. ""So you have injuries, identification, you have an immediate report ... and he (the detective) doesn't issue probable cause to get a search warrant for Mr. Winston's DNA. Instead, he issues a search warrant into the victim's phone records,"" she said. Last week, Willie Meggs, the state attorney for the 2nd Judicial Circuit, which includes Leon County and Tallahassee, announced he would not file charges against Winston, whom the woman accused of rape in December 2012. Meggs' decision followed a police investigation that the woman's family has alleged included undue emphasis on Winston's role as a leading player on the nation's top-ranked football team. He is also a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, which honors the nation's most outstanding college football athlete. At the time, Meggs dismissed such criticisms, saying there was insufficient evidence even to arrest Winston, much less charge him with a crime. Winston has said through his attorney, Tim Jansen, that he had consensual sex with the woman. Carroll said Friday that what she called a botched investigation deserves attention from outside investigators ""because if victims are subjected on an ongoing basis to what this victim has been subjected to, this is a serious problem in the state of Florida."" Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has spoken with the head of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement about the possibility of an inquiry, but no formal request has been received, spokesman Jenn Meale told CNN on Friday. David Northway, the Tallahassee Police Department's public information officer, said, ""The case has been closed by the State's Attorney Office, and the department continues to support him in all of his endeavors."" According to police documents, the woman told investigators she had been drinking with friends at a Tallahassee bar called Potbelly's. She said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar. She said she did not remember much of what happened next but told investigators she remembered winding up in a ground-floor apartment, where a man took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections. She reported the alleged assault to campus police that night. The woman came forward a month after making her initial report to accuse Winston, but Tallahassee's interim Police Chief Tom Coe said last week that she ""broke off contact"" with investigators in February and said she didn't want to go forward with the case. The woman's family has said that a detective had warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a ""big football town"" and that her life could be miserable if she pursued the case. Carroll said the woman is not contemplating any civil litigation and is focusing on finishing final examinations at Florida State under special accommodations made by the school. She said the woman's sorority has been subjected to threats and has had some tires slashed. CNN's Marlena Baldacci, Devon Sayers and Tristan Smith contributed to this report.","Attorney for alleged victim says police focused on her client .

"New York (CNN) -- The New York City Police Department was searching Wednesday for a man who allegedly punched a 33-year-old woman in the back of the head in Brooklyn, in what could be the latest in a spate of ""knockout"" assaults. The incident occurred just before 3 p.m. on Saturday, but police released a sketch of the suspect Tuesday. The unidentified woman and her 7-year-old daughter were walking in the Midwood section of Brooklyn when the attacker approached her and punched her in the back of the head, knocking her down, then fled on foot, according to the NYPD. The woman sustained minor injuries to her knees and hands when she fell, police said. The suspect is described as about 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 9 inches tall, with short braids, and was wearing a black wool cap, green jacket, and dark-colored jeans, police said. This latest attack follows a series of assaults known as the ""knockout game,"" where teens try to knock random strangers unconscious with a single blow. At least nine suspected ""knockout"" attacks have been reported since October in New York, but police have said they see no evidence of a trend. A NYPD spokeswoman told CNN on Wednesday that police ""investigate each assault individually"" and that the latest attack was still under investigation. In November, a 23-year-old man was walking in the Bronx one afternoon when he was punched and knocked to the ground by men who continued to punch him after he was down. Authorities have reported similar incidents in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, Missouri and Washington. In New Haven, Connecticut, police said there were seven reported incidents possibly connected to ""knockout"" assaults, but it was unclear if they were carried out by the same person. There were no major injuries in the attacks, which occurred in the same three- to four-block area on November 17-18. The assaults stopped after police questioned a suspect, though no arrest was made. ""We have no reason to believe this is a hate crime,"" said Officer David Hartman, a New Haven police spokesman. Some previous assaults in the region have targeted Jewish people. Hartman said police believe the attacks were copycat crimes spurred by media attention. Youth violence expert Chuck Williams blamed the media and parents for what he called extreme aggression by America's youths. Negative attention, he said, is often rewarded. ""That's America. America loves violence, and so do our kids,"" he said. ""We market violence to our children and we wonder why they're violent. It's because we are."" Williams, a professor of psychology and education at Drexel University in Philadelphia, said some young people are desperate for attention. He called it the ""Miley Cyrus effect,"" where teens will do anything, no matter how unconscionable, to get noticed. ""These kids know the consequences,"" he said. ""They want to get arrested. They want to get caught, because they want that notoriety. They know they won't go away forever because they're kids. It's a win-win all around for them.""

"(CNN) -- Tattoos have had a variety of purposes over their 5,000-year history. In cultures from ancient Egyptian to Polynesian, they've served as medicine, rite of passage, good-luck charm, punishment, decoration, religious, political or status symbol, and, of course, tribute to a loved one. And many times, that loved one is Mom. ""Just about anybody that's heavily tattooed, if they don't have it already, [a mom tattoo] is definitely on their list of things to get,"" said tattoo artist Alan Flores, who works out of 13 Roses Tattoo Parlour in Atlanta. What's thought of as the ""traditional"" mom tattoo -- a heart with a banner, stereotypically seen on World War II-era sailors -- is still a popular design. ""I've done plenty of mom tattoos with banners around hearts,"" said Flores. But custom motifs, handwriting and even portraits are gaining ground -- check out the gallery above. ""I did one the other day on a guy; his mom is a tennis player, so I drew up a head with a tennis racket,"" said Flores. And sometimes customers just come to him with general ideas -- ""favorite flowers, things she likes"" -- and then ""it's up to me to create that image that they're picturing."" In Flores' experience, people usually get mom or dad tattoos as memorials for a parent after they've passed away. Of course, they can also honor a special occasion or serve as a tribute. Kyle Divine, in the gallery above, got his tattoo on Mother's Day in 2006, and John Clarke got his for his mother's 70th birthday. Amanda Clifton and her mom got matching tattoos during a mother/daughter vacation. ""When you have so much love for a person, it's hard not to show some love with ink,"" Clifton remarked. Pondering a tattoo of your own to honor mom? If you're thinking of a custom or unique piece, like a portrait, Flores recommends bringing in your tattoo artist from the start to refine your vision.

"(CNN) -- Three men were killed and two others wounded early Christmas morning in a shooting outside a New Jersey bar, according to the Essex County prosecutor's office. The son of the owner of Slick's Go Go Bar in Irvington -- identified as Pierre Clervoyant, 34, a resident of Elizabeth, New Jersey -- and nightclub employee Woodley Daniel, 32, of Irvington, died after the shooting, authorities said. The identity of the third victim, who authorities said appeared to be an unintended target, was not released.

"Shenzhen, China (CNN) -- Three weeks ago, hip-hop star Andre Young -- better known as Dr. Dre -- made news as his Beats Electronics line, a maker of premium headphones, was valued at more than $1 billion thanks to an investment from the Carlyle Group. But the former N.W.A. rapper is not the only one profiting from his headphone line. Across the Pearl River Delta in southern China, counterfeit Beats are flowing out of factories, assembly workshops and shops, attracting businesspeople that sell the headphones on global markets. A CNN reporter approached wholesale companies about buying in bulk in order to learn how the underground sale of knock-off headphones works. ""Business is very good,"" said a woman, who, with her family, runs a wholesale company selling copied headphones in one of Shenzhen's many mega-malls. ""You buy cheap from me, you sell expensive in your home country, we all make a lot of money,"" she added. To prove her point, she shows an Excel spread sheet on her laptop listing customers from all over the world: Italy, Denmark, United States, Canada, Dubai, Russia and more. She said she recently sold a large amount of counterfeit Beats by Dr. Dre for $50,000 to a British businessman who sent them to the UK by jet -- which is considerably more expensive than container ship -- and sold them as originals. While top-line Beats headphones retail for $400, the Shenzhen operators interviewed sell knock-off versions wholesale for $70. ""A lot of people are making a lot of money on Beats right now,"" she said. Factory owners here have a nose for what's hot and what's not. Nearly 70% of all fake goods -- including DVDs, clothing, and electronics goods -- seized worldwide from 2008-2010 came from China, according to the World Customs Organization. And looking at the shops in Shenzhen's Huaqiangbei commercial district -- a destination for buying electronics, especially fakes -- Beats by Dr. Dre are definitely hot, prominently displayed next to iPhones, Samsung gear and Nikon cameras. To look at them, some are clearly fakes with poor packaging and logo color schemes that are wildly different from those well-known products. Rise of high-priced headphones . Behind the shops and inside small rooms around the district, workers in their early 20s can be seen busily assembling counterfeit goods, such as smartphones and iPads. The long corridors are filled with cigarette smoke that drifts out from the tiny workshops as deliverymen rush by with their arms full of electronic components. Everywhere you hear the sound of packing tape being wrapped around cardboard boxes. The counterfeit boom is fed, these days, by the rise of high-end headphones that Dr. Dre's audio products helped kickstart with the launch of Beats in 2008, analysts say. Just a few years ago, few people would be ready to pay several hundred dollars for a pair of headphones. Now, with celebrities like Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber and P. Diddy putting their names to signature pairs, Beats is the hottest brand for stylish music lovers. ""Today, the premium headphone market is defined by fashion and brands as much as it is by sound quality,"" Ben Arnold, director of industry analysis at market research firm NPD Group said in a recent report. ""One third of premium headphone buyers are under the age of 25 and many of these consumers view headphones as equal parts listening device and fashion accessory."" Richard Kramer, analyst at Arete Research, added that better audio quality in smartphones is also one of the main driving forces behind making high-end headphones viable. In the U.S., sales of headphones rose by a third last year to $2.4 billion, with Beats by Dr. Dre making up almost 70% of all high-end headphones during the Christmas period, according to market research firm NPD. In Europe, sales of headphones hit an all-time high in the first quarter of the year, figures from market research group GfK show, with premium headphones leading the way. Total sales increased by 9% during Q1 on Europe's 17 main markets to 304 million euro (US$410 million), according to GfK. Real or fake headphones? At another Shenzhen store, a sales executive at a factory and trading company, connects a pair of fake Beats Pro to her iPhone and puts them on the reporter's head. The sound quality is surprisingly good. In the U.S., an original pair would cost $400. She offers her best quality headphones for the wholesale price of $70, medium quality for $45 and ""so-so quality"" for $30. ""Medium quality is most popular, but the trend is going towards high-end. Consumers want good sound,"" she said, adding that she can deliver 100 units of any Beats product by the following day. For 1,000 items it will take a week. ""Since it's copies, we don't want to have too much in stock,"" she said. On the streets and down in the subway, in-ear Beats headphones are sold for as little as $1. According to the company website, real in-ear Beats sell for $100 and up. Beats Electronics, the company behind the Beats by Dr. Dre brand, said in an email to CNN that the company shows ""a fierce commitment"" to fight piracy and that it works in close collaboration with anti-counterfeiting organizations, police and customs authorities to identify counterfeit sellers, distributors and manufacturers on key markets. They also scan online marketplaces for unauthorized use of Beats trademarks. ""Since efforts began, Beats has seized hundreds of thousands of counterfeit products in more than 50 countries,"" the company said. The U.S. government has long complained about the theft of intellectual property in China. CNN reached out to authorities in Shenzhen to ask about counterfeit sales activities, but they have not yet responded. However it appears that Chinese officials are moving to crack down on counterfeit trade. A month-long joint operation with U.S. Customs in July resulted in the seizure of more than 243,000 counterfeit products using trademarks from Beats by Dr. Dre., Apple, Blackberry and Samsung. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the operation was the biggest bilateral customs enforcement effort ever conducted by the U.S. As a result, a man in New Orleans was arrested for allegedly importing counterfeit Dr. Dre headphones and selling them on Craigslist. Evading the police . But in Shenzhen, the counterfeiters are working hard, too. CNN spoke with another woman involved in the trade -- a ""copy brand exports professional"" according to her business card -- who helps companies to transport counterfeit goods from Shenzhen to other countries. She said she advises her customers to avoid Chinese logistic companies and always use European or American shipping companies since ""customs usually trusts these brands better."" Storeowners reveal other tricks to bypass customs. They send all Beats in two boxes; the outer box has a made-up name to hide the real goods. ""We got the idea from a European customer,"" she said. Precautions aside, in the Huaqiangbei commercial district few seem to have any moral objections about the pirating of goods. Outside the Huaqiangbei Police Station, a friendly officer in sunglasses points down the street when asked where the best fake mobile phones can be found. Asked if such purchases are legal, he just breaks out in loud laughter.","Popularity of high-priced headphones has led to a rise in fakes coming out of China .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Forty-three people, including 19 Americans, face prosecution in an Egyptian criminal court on charges of illegal foreign funding as part of an ongoing crackdown on nongovernmental organizations, a prosecution spokesman said Sunday. Those referred to court also include five Serbs, two Germans and three Arabs, said Adel Saeed, spokesman for the general prosecutor. The remaining people are Egyptian, he said. The defendants include Sam LaHood, International Republican Institute country director and the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, Saeed said. The defendants were named by an investigation committee created by Egypt's justice minister, Egypt's state-run Nile TV reported. ""We have seen media reports that judicial officials in Egypt intend to forward a number of cases involving U.S.-funded NGOs to the Cairo criminal court,"" said Mark Toner, deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department. ""We are deeply concerned by these reports and are seeking clarification from the government of Egypt."" Egyptian authorities carried out 17 raids on the offices of 10 NGOs in late December, but offered no clear explanation for the raids as they happened. A spokesman with the general prosecutor's office said the raids were part of an investigation into allegations the groups had received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a proper license. Three U.S.-based organizations operating in Egypt were part of the raids. Egyptian police confiscated everything from desks, cell phones, documents and computers to office safes, Leslie Campbell with the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs told CNN in an interview just after the raids. U.S.-based Freedom House and the International Republican Institute (IRI) reported their offices were raided as well. Despite assurances the State Department says were given to the U.S. ambassador by Egyptian authorities, two of the NGOs said that as of early January, no property or cash had been returned. ""We had been assured by leaders in the Egyptian government that this issue would be resolved, that harassment would end, that NGOs would be allowed to go back to business as usual and that their property would be returned,"" State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said last month. ""It is, frankly, unacceptable to us that that situation has not been returned to normal."" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson both spoke with high-ranking Egyptian officials following the raids to voice their concern. Nuland said last month there are apparently ""some Mubarak holdovers in the government who don't seem to understand how these organizations operate in a democratic society, and are putting out lots of disinformation about them."" Human Rights Watch called Sunday for Egyptian authorities to drop the charges and stop the criminal investigation into the NGOs. ""The Egyptian authorities are using a discredited Mubarak-era law to prosecute nongovernmental groups while proposing even more restrictive legislation,"" said Joe Stork, Human Rights Watch's deputy Middle East director, in a statement. ""The government should stop using the old law, halt the criminal investigations and propose a law that respects international standards."" The IRI said in a statement Sunday the reported prosecution ""reflects escalating attacks against international and Egyptian democracy organizations,"" calling it a ""politically motivated assault."" Egyptian officials have called it a ""legitimate judicial process,"" the organization said, but ""the continued assault on American, German and Egyptian civil society is not a 'legitimate judicial process.' It is a politically motivated effort to squash Egypt's growing civil society, orchestrated through the courts, in part by Mubarak-era holdovers."" The National Democratic Institute said in a statement that while it does not know specifically which individuals or organizations are implicated, it was ""deeply concerned about this development."" ""NDI conducts all of its nonpartisan activities in Egypt in an open and transparent manner, and has cooperated fully with this probe,"" it said. ""NDI applied for registration through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2005 and has fulfilled all of the registration requirements for the past six years, including a number of updates provided in January."" In late January, U.S. government officials said Sam LaHood was among three Americans taking refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Cairo because they voiced concerns about their personal safety. ""We do not believe they were in physical danger, but they had concerns, and they were invited by the embassy,"" Nuland said, explaining that the Americans had approached embassy staff. ""This was a unique situation,"" Nuland said, adding that those in the Embassy are not trying to avoid the legal process. Sam LaHood said while he felt ""safe physically,"" he was concerned that the investigation into the work of American non-governmental organizations has ""taken on a more serious nature, and the next step from here would either be arrest or go to trial."" Egypt's investigation of and raids on U.S. democracy support groups working in that country could mean the end of U.S. aid to Egypt, members of Congress told top Obama administration officials, as well as the head of Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, last week. In a February 2 letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Panetta, 41 members of Congress urged the administration to withhold further aid to Egypt until the country's leadership lets the offices of those organizations reopen and returns seized property. Members of Congress issue warning on U.S. aid to Egypt . The United States sends more than $1.3 billion each year in military aid to Egypt, according to the U.S. State Department. And, since 1975, the U.S. Agency for International Development has provided more than $28 billion in economic and development assistance to Egypt. ""The absence of a quick and satisfactory resolution to this issue will make it increasingly difficult for congressional supporters of a strong U.S.-Egypt bilateral relationship to defend current levels of assistance to Egypt, especially in this climate of budget cuts in Washington,"" the letter warns. ""It's essential that Egypt not take any legal action whatsoever against these NGO workers,"" Rep. Peter King, R-New York and chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said Sunday. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt's ruling military council, assumed control of the government following the ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak last year. ""We're being accused of things we've never done,"" IRI President Lorne Craner said last month. ""We are told we have operated without registration, and that is true because we filed our registration papers five and a half years ago. We were told the papers are complete and we're still waiting."" ""We've operated for 30 years, everywhere from (dictator Augusto) Pinochet's Chile to Nicaragua, to the Soviet Union when it was the Soviet Union, to Central Europe, to Indonesia under Suharto,"" he said. ""We work in China, Belarus. This has never, ever happened in the 30 years where we get our offices raided. And Egypt is supposed to be an American friend.""

"(CNN) -- The number of states reporting widespread seasonal flu activity jumped from four to 10 last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Widespread activity was reported in Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming, according to the CDC's weekly flu advisory report, covering the week ending December 21. The previous week, only Alabama, Louisiana, New York and Texas reported widespread flu. ""Widespread"" means that more than 50% of geographic regions in a state -- counties, for example -- are reporting flu activity. It addresses the spread of the flu, not its severity. However, six states -- Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas -- reported a high proportion of outpatient visits to health care providers for flu-like illnesses. So far, ""it's a typical influenza season, if I can use that word,"" said Dr. Michael Jhung, a medical officer in the CDC's flu division. The season usually begins in the winter months and peaks in January or February. The only atypical thing seen this year is that the most common strain has been H1N1, which became known as swine flu during a 2009 outbreak. ""It's the same virus that we saw in 2009 that caused the pandemic,"" Jhung said. At the time, it was called swine flu since it was seen for the first time in humans. But since then, ""it's established itself very nicely in the human population,"" Jhung said. ""We've seen it every season since 2009 in people."" The virus is no longer referred to as swine flu but instead as a human seasonal virus. The strain is so common that it's included in the flu vaccine, including this year's vaccination, he said. 5 ways to combat flu in your home . Four pediatric flu deaths have been reported since September 29, according to the CDC. The agency does not track adult deaths related to the flu, although some states do, and deaths have been reported. The exact number of flu-related adult deaths is hard to track and varies from year to year. The CDC has estimated that from 1976 through 2007, between 3,000 and 49,000 people died of flu-related causes. ""It depends on the season; it depends on the virus,"" Jhung said. Last year, 381,000 people were hospitalized and 169 children died in what's being called a relatively severe season. However, the CDC estimates that flu vaccination prevented 6.6 million illnesses last year, 3.2 million doctor visits and at least 79,000 hospitalizations. Flu vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 months and older, especially pregnant women and those at high risk of complications, including the elderly, children younger than 5 years and those with underlying medical conditions such as asthma or diabetes. Antiviral medications are a good treatment if you do get sick, Jhung said, particularly those at high risk for complications. Ideally, antivirals should be started within two days of when symptoms appear. CNN's Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report.","Widespread seasonal activity is increasing, the CDC says .

"(CNN) -- After the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, hundreds of thousands of cards, letters, drawings, stuffed animals and other sentimental items poured into Newtown from throughout the world in a show of support. Newtown resident Yolie Moreno said Friday that she plans a unique way to turn those sentiments into the actual building blocks of a future memorial. Moreno started an initiative called Embracing Newtown which will make use of the massive amounts of material that turned up starting in January at the town's municipal center. She wanted to ensure that well wishes were preserved. Moreno enlisted the help of more than 100 volunteers to sort through the piles of mementos. The items were incinerated, with the ashes, or what Moreno called ""sacred soil,"" to be used in the making of bricks to serve as the foundation of a future memorial honoring the 26 who lost their lives. The incarceration occurred in garbage facility that allowed volunteers to be present, Moreno said. ""Every single thing was [incinerated] to make sure it was not thrown away,"" she said. ""I'm talking the tags from every teddy bear. Nothing ended up in a landfill."" Four tractor-trailer cargo containers hold the incinerated mementos, Moreno said. Moreno described the process as energy being transformed into a testament to the love and goodness of the people who reached out to Newtown in so many ways. The kindness of strangers was also documented on the website embracingnewtown.com, where galleries of the artwork and letters can be viewed as well as at Newtown's Library. The letters that appear on the website have also been archived, according to Moreno. ""You will be in my dreams tonight,"" says the writing on one drawing on embracingnewtown.com, with a list of the names of 26 who were killed on December 14, 2012 and the image of a sleeping child. Another letter states, ""Not one kid will be forgotten."" ""The letters were for students as they're processing this through their life,"" she said. ""They'll see these inspirational letters and that people really care. That's my goal."" The letters came from every state as well as dozens of countries. ""This was never about me,"" Moreno said. ""This is about what happened to Sandy Hook. This was just an important thing to do. ""","Newtown residents collected mementos that poured into town from throughout the world .

"(CNN) -- For several weeks, Frances Johnson had been telling her 2-year-old son Noah the following: ""Mommy and Daddy are going to go to work for a while ... but we always come back for you. ""We always come back for you."" Noah is too young to understand that his mommy and daddy's ""work"" involves deploying to Afghanistan just around the new year, and that ""a while"" could be between six and 12 months. But there are signs he seems to grasp how his life is about to dramatically change, Johnson said. When she said goodbye to him at the airport, which would be the last time she'd see him in person for months, he wanted to come along and said, ""Me mama work?"" Johnson, who didn't want to cry in front of Noah for fear of making it even harder on him, couldn't hold back the tears. ""I started crying and told him that I wish he could come to work with me, but that I would come back to him like I always do as soon as I could."" ""I said, 'I always come back for you.'"" Then, fearing she was really going to lose it, she gave him lots of kisses, hugged him for a ""very long time"" and walked away as fast as she could. ""It's really rough, I'm not gonna lie,"" she said in those first days after their goodbye. I can't even imagine how rough. The most I've been away from my girls, ages 6 and 7, was 2Â½ weeks. The only people who perhaps can truly understand how rough it will be are the small group of military couples who have been deployed at the same time. From 2011 to the present, 681 Marine Corps couples had simultaneous deployments, according to the Manpower Management Information Systems Division Headquarters for the U.S. Marine Corps. 'Man, this is going to be hard' The Marine Corps did not order the Johnsons to deploy together. Frances Johnson, a Marine Corps combat correspondent, volunteered with her husband's full support because she has not deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan during her six years in the military and always wanted to experience a deployment. Her husband's enlistment was about to end after 10 years, so he would remain home with Noah while she deployed. But then her husband, a Marine sergeant who is a program manager with infantry detection dogs and a clerk with the Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection unit, was offered a deployment that would give him a chance for a promotion to staff sergeant. Johnson encouraged her husband, Andrew, whom she calls Drew, to take it, even though it would mean both would be away from Noah at the same time. READ iReport: Husband wife deploying together . ""He's always been there for me. He's always encouraged me to do more and grow,"" she said. ""I said this is kind of a sign. 'Hey, it's not time for you to go just yet. You still have a little more work in the Marine Corps.'"" Since making that decision, they have tried not to dwell on how tough it will be for Noah and for them, but of course, that is much easier said than done. ""I said, 'At least we'll be together,'"" said Johnson, who will be deployed to the same base as her husband in southwestern Afghanistan. ""Other than that, it was just a whole lot of, 'Man, this is going to be hard,' especially when (Noah would) come into bed with us in the morning. He's still sleepy but he climbs on in and he's just all happy and cuddly and it's just, 'Man, I'm really going to ... this is going to suck.'"" 'I've heard that I'm a bad mom ... for leaving' Her mom and dad, who live outside Denver, agreed to watch Noah while she and her husband are overseas, so they moved him from California to Colorado shortly before Thanksgiving to help him adjust to a new routine. She then had to return to work in San Diego in early December, and her husband a few weeks later. They'll be spending Christmas away from Noah before departing to Afghanistan. Johnson's family has been extremely supportive, but not everyone understands their decision, especially since it was their choice. ""I've heard that I'm a bad mom and a bad wife for leaving, especially when we didn't know Drew was going to be going. I heard a lot of, 'How could you leave your son like that?'"" she said. ""Sometimes, people who find out that both of us are deploying, they kind of say backhanded comments like, 'Wow, you guys are so brave for leaving your son. I could never do that.' And, 'You know, I try to be so centered around my kids.' And it's like, 'OK, well, me, too, but this is my job.'"" It's hard to know if those same people who seem to be passing judgment, even if they are doing it in a less than direct way, would have been more understanding a few years ago when there were two wars going on at the same time, the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and both were getting more attention here at home. But regardless of the answer to that question, the fact that some people don't seem to appreciate Frances and Drew's service and the extraordinary sacrifice they will be making isn't lost on them, especially on Frances. ""It hurts, but my husband is very, very good about focusing on the positives, because I am very good at focusing on the negatives,"" she said with a laugh, remembering a wacky time recently when Noah was cracking up during a family silly string fight. ""After everything had kind of settled down, (Drew) was like, 'See he's going to remember the good times and he thinks, this is good, and he's not going to say, 'Well, I can't believe you left me when I was 2. He's going to remember the good.'"" 'He can still have me close' Frances plans to take ""quite a few pictures"" of Noah with her along with all the pictures she already has on her iPhone. Plus, she's bringing a special bear she and Drew got when she was 22 weeks pregnant with Noah. ""We had gone to a 3-D ultrasound place, and they recorded his heartbeat and put it inside the bear so I'll be taking that with me,"" she said. She and Drew are also leaving plenty behind for Noah, including their bed and some of their clothes so that he can just ""hang out with mom and dad's scent."" They've been taking pictures of just about everything they do so Noah will have them on the computer. Her mom also plans to have some pictures printed on little pillowcases and to hang a canvas of pictures in his room. ""I (plan) on writing him because he's very, very smart,"" she said. ""He likes to be read to, so I wanted to write him letters so that my mom can read them to him and he understands that mom's far away but ... he can still have me close."" Leaving a son: 'OK, how do I prepare for that?' She feels mentally ready for her deployment, especially after a series of classes the military provides to give a better understanding of what she might encounter in Afghanistan. But it's pretty much impossible to know how to prepare for being away from her son, she told me. ""I'm just like, 'OK, how do I prepare for that? How do I?'"" she said. ""I don't know how to handle that."" WATCH: Saying goodbye to a college-bound daughter . She has a friend who has two boys and recently returned from a deployment, and plans to reach out to get an understanding of how she coped with being apart. Still, she continues to have moments where she wonders if she'll really be able to do this. It was especially hard after some recent family outings to the park and SeaWorld. ""Then it's like, 'Man, how can I leave this?'"" she said. A few minutes later, she said, the doubts go away. ""We're going to do this and we know it's not going to be that bad and we'll all be better for it,'"" she said. She and Drew, who has been to Iraq twice, are aware of the dangers, but try not to dwell on them. Instead, they focus on the future, especially their homecoming. ""All I can think about is coming back and seeing him at the airport when I fly back,"" she said. ""I keep thinking about how I'll try to be as polite as possible, but I'll probably be running people over just to get to him."" And who could blame her?

"(CNN) -- A frigid winter storm system that put Dallas in the deep freeze is hitting the East Coast on Sunday. Luckily for those people, it should be a short visit. Snow, ice or freezing rain will fall on Washington, Philadelphia and New York City, the National Weather Service said. On Monday, temperatures will rise into the 40s and any accumulation should start to melt after the morning commute, the weather service predicts. Folks in other parts of the country will need an extra blanket on the bed as unseasonably cold weather will continue. And some people in the Gulf Coast and Southeast states will see heavy rain. On Sunday, temperatures were expected to reach only about 10 degrees in the northern and central Rockies, the northern Plains and the upper Midwest. Sleet and freezing rain are forecast from the Tennessee Valley to the mid-Atlantic region. The heaviest snow will fall across the central Appalachian Mountains, the weather service said. Some areas of the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast will see as much as 3 inches of snow. The weather was causing delays at some of the nation's major airports, especially for inbound flights. Arrivals to Philadelphia International Airport were backed up by an average of 100 minutes, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's website. Kennedy airport in New York had delays of nearly one hour, as did Chicago's O'Hare. The Twitter account for Reagan airport in Washington said there was a temporary halt of flights as crews treated runways. It advised passengers to check with their airlines on their flight status. All told, there were 2,459 U.S. flight cancellations on Sunday and 804 seen for Monday, according to the air travel tracking website Flightaware.com, which tracks both mechanical and weather cancellations. NFL fans in several outdoor stadiums had to put on extra layers. The Pittsburgh Steelers PR team tweeted out a photo of a snow-dusted field as the team prepared to play Miami. In Philadelphia, it was even worse as flying flakes made it difficult to see, and then blanketed the playing surface. Parts of Texas, the upper South and the Midwest socked by the winter storm will warm up just a little bit. The weather service said the temps will rise into the high 30s and 40s, but drop below freezing again Sunday night. How cold was it? On Saturday, Southern Methodist University offered free tickets for its football game with Central Florida but didn't get many takers. All but a few seats in the stadium were empty. The high temperature at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport Saturday was 26 -- the coldest high temperature ever recorded there on any December 7 and the coldest December day in the area in 23 years, CNN affiliate WFAA-TV reported. At least seven people have died in storm-related incidents, with the Texas State Patrol reporting two weather-related fatalities on Saturday but providing no details. In Lewisville, about 25 miles north of Dallas, the driver of a pickup lost control on an icy road, spun out of control before dawn on Saturday on a road over Lake Lewisville, went over a guardrail and landed in the water. Firefighters dove into the frigid water and towed the truck to the bridge. The unidentified driver died. A passenger was killed Thursday when a vehicle lost control and crashed into another car in Hockley County, the Texas Department of Public Safety said. In Arkansas, a man was killed late Thursday when a tree fell on his camper in Pope County, the Department of Emergency Management said. Highway Patrol officials in Oklahoma blamed at least one death, in Muskogee, on the weather. In New Mexico, one person died when a semi crashed near Clines Corners. In Arizona, a Saturday night snowstorm stranded 300 vehicles along Interstate 15. Rigs jackknifed and passenger cars slid into rigs, creating a chain-reaction accident, ""resulting in this enormous backup,"" Arizona Department of Public Safety Officer Bart Graves told CNN. Authorities were forced to shut the interstate for more than 12 hours to clear the road. ""We had travelers running out of gas. They provided them food, water, and blankets,"" Graves said, adding that all injuries were minor. Winter came much earlier than usual in many sections of the nation. Farmersburg, Indiana, recorded up to 10 inches of snow Thursday and temperatures fell into the single digits at night. ""This was early for us to have this much measurable snow late in the fall, but has happened before,"" Mark Ivy told CNN iReport. ""It is more the cold that is unusual."" In East Kingsford, Michigan, iReporter Jason Asselin said he's covering up with blankets to keep out the cold. ""In December, our average temperatures are in the 20s,"" he said. ""Currently it is zero degrees outside."" Across the High Plains and into the Great Lakes, temperatures were expected to be 10 to 35 degrees below average. The wind chill index was predicted to drop as low as 35 to 45 degrees below zero in some areas.

"(CNN) -- Someone went into a large roost of blackbirds in Beebe, Arkansas, as the clock struck midnight Saturday and set off fireworks, contributing to the deaths of scores of blackbirds, a state wildlife spokeswoman said. Last New Year's Eve, roughly 5,000 birds were found dead in a square-mile area in Beebe, a central Arkansas town about 35 miles northeast of Little Rock through which birds migrate and that is home to a large roost for the birds. Fireworks last year caused otherwise healthy birds to become disoriented and ""fly all over the place"" into stationary objects, such as trees and buildings, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission spokeswoman Ginny Porter said. Those birds' deaths were likely ""not intentional,"" Porter added. But questions remain about the intention of the person or persons who set off fireworks that killed about 200 blackbirds this weekend. In light of the fatalities one year earlier, a state wildlife officer and Beebe police officers were patrolling the area mindful of the dangers that fireworks posed to the blackbirds, the wildlife spokesman noted. Even so, 50 birds died when fireworks went off around 7 p.m. Saturday, said Porter, who added, ""We don't know where or who shot them (fireworks)."" The majority of the blackbird deaths occurred five hours later at midnight, in a bunch of trees, or roost, in a residential area. ""Someone went into the roost and set off fireworks,"" the spokeswoman said. "" We didn't catch them, we don't know who."" Blackbirds have poor night vision and do not typically fly at night, according to the game commission. Robbie Stroud, a resident of Beebe, told CNN affiliate KARK that the latest deaths of birds were disarming, but not as jarring as what happened 12 months ago. ""It was pretty wild,"" Stroud recalled of the scene last January 1. ""We got out and backed out of the driveway, and it was freaky, man. There were dead birds lying everywhere."" CNN's Maggie Schneider and Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","NEW: A Beebe resident recalls last year as ""freaky,"" with ""dead birds lying everywhere""

"(CNN) -- Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb army commander who went on trial Wednesday for crimes against humanity, is a notorious name synonymous with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Balkan wars of the 1990s and the bloody assaults on Sarajevo and Srebrenica. During the five-day orgy of slaughter at Srebrenica, which Mladic is accused of being directly involved in, up to 8,000 Muslims were exterminated in what was described by the U.N. war crimes tribunal as ""the triumph of evil."" A judge at The Hague tribunal described what happened there in July 1995 as ""truly scenes from hell written on the darkest pages of human history."" Born in Kalnovik, Bosnia-Herzegovina, during the height of World War II, the 70-year-old was a career soldier who served in Yugoslavia's military before that nation dissolved in the early 1990s. Mladic was shaped by the war when his father was killed by Croat Nazis when he was two years old. In 1965 he graduated from a military academy and joined the Communist Party in Yugoslavia, an ethnic stew of six states -- Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Montenegro. Over the following three decades he rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. By the time he took Bosnia's battlefields he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as defender of their dwindling fortunes.. In May 1992, Bosnia's Serbian political leaders picked him to head their forces and lead the assault on their enemies. Bosnia's Muslim leaders wanted independence while the Serbs wanted to remain part of Yugoslavia -- and the ethnic majority. Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces to besiege Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world by shelling and sniping at its poorly prepared civilian population in the valley below them. More than 10,000 people, most of them civilians, were killed. Over the course of the three-year war that raged across the whole country more than a quarter million people died, making the conflict the bloodiest in Europe since World War II. A French policeman who collected evidence from Bosnian Muslims, Jean-Rene Ruez, told The Hague tribunal in 1996 that Bosnian Serb forces killed and tortured refugees in Srebrenica at will. Streets were littered with corpses, he said, and rivers were red with blood. Many people committed suicide to avoid having their noses, lips and ears chopped off, he said. Among other lurid accounts of mass murder, Ruez cited cases of adults being forced to kill their children or watching as soldiers ended the young lives. ""One soldier approached a woman in the middle of a crowd,"" he said. ""Her child was crying. The soldier asked why the child was crying and she explained that he was hungry. The soldier made a comment like, 'He won't be hungry anymore.' He slit the child's throat in front of everybody."" As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run. Over the years, he eluded authorities while his cohort, Karadzic, was apprehended and is facing various charges at the court in The Hague. Their mentor, former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, died in jail in 2006 during his trial at The Hague. Eventually, more than 16 years later, he was captured an hour's drive from the Serbian capital living on a farm with a cousin. World leaders and human rights groups described the arrest as ""historic"" and ""an important step forward."" Key dates in hunt for Mladic . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it a ""historic day for international justice. This arrest marks an important step in our collective fight against impunity."" Interpol called Mladic ""Europe's most wanted war crimes suspect"" while Amnesty International's law chief Widney Brown said ""at last the people who suffered have hope he will be brought to justice."" The arrest meant a major hurdle that once stood between Serbia and its long-awaited entrance into the European Union was overcome, but the trial could also usher in political backlash from the country's electorate, some of whom consider Mladic a hero. Speaking to a Serbian Radical Party demonstration outside Belgrade's parliament building immediate after the arrest, Darko Mladic described his father as ""a freedom fighter."" The elder Mladic ""defended his own nation, defended his people, which was his job,"" his son said. Robertson: Bosnia's future is tied to justice . His family and lawyer have tried to use his poor health to prevent his extradition to the International Criminal Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia in the Netherlands, but they failed. In the court room at The Hague last year Mladic appeared to have lost none of his visceral dislike of his enemies. CNN's Nic Robertson said he saw the defendant drawing his finger across his throat, ""a gesture aimed directly at at some of the Srebrenica widows sitting in front of me, whose husbands he is accused of killing.""","Former Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic on trial for crimes against humanity .

"(CNN) -- A fugitive wanted by the FBI in the killing of a U.S. diplomat in 2000 has been arrested by French forces in Mali, a source familiar with the case told CNN on Thursday. Alhassane Ould Mohamed, also known as ""Cheibani,"" a 43-year-old Malian citizen, was named in an indictment unsealed in a federal court in New York in September. He was charged with the slaying of U.S. Department of Defense official William Bultemeier in Niamey, Niger, in December 2000. Authorities said Mohamed and another suspect confronted a group of employees of the U.S. Embassy in Niger as they left a restaurant in Niamey. The two men, armed with a pistol and an AK-47 assault rifle, approached Bultemeier as he was about to enter his car. The suspect is accused of shooting Bultemeier after asking him to turn over the keys to the diplomatic vehicle. U.S. Marine Christopher McNeely was wounded in the attack. The gunmen drove away in the diplomatic vehicle. Bultemeier, a military attache, died of his injuries. ""U.S. diplomat William Bultemeier lost his life while representing his country overseas, and U.S. Marine Christopher McNeely was gravely wounded trying to protect him, all during the brazen armed carjacking allegedly perpetrated by the defendant and his confederate,"" Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement at the time. Mohamed was arrested in Mali in December 2000, according the FBI website. He was never formally charged and escaped in 2002. In late 2009, Mohamed killed four Saudi Arabian nationals in northern Niger. In 2010, he was arrested and convicted in those slayings. Mohamed was serving a 20-year prison sentence in Niger when he escaped on June 1, 2013.","Fugitive wanted in the slaying of U.S. diplomat is arrested by French forces in Mali .

"(CNN) -- It was a heroic moment caught on tape. A police officer in Cape May, New Jersey, ran up to a burning pickup truck and pulled out its unconscious driver, then ran back toward the blaze to search for other possible passengers. ""A million things were going through my head. I wasn't sure if anyone was in the vehicle. If someone was, I just wanted to get them out,"" patrolman Scott Krissinger told CNN's ""New Day"" Thursday. The incident, captured on a police dash cam, happened Monday evening in West Cape May. Police received a call about a car burning on the roadway, with a person possibly inside. Krissinger was the first to arrive at the scene. He ran to the driver's side of the burning Chevy Colorado truck. ""When I opened the door I didn't know what to expect,"" he said. ""I couldn't really see anything. I just reached my hand in and felt him and pulled him out."" The video shows the officer dragging the driver away from the truck before running back to the burning vehicle and opening the passenger side door. He wanted to make sure that no one else was inside, he said. There was fear in the back of his mind, and adrenaline, too. Krissinger can't remember how hard it was to pull the man out. The driver, 61-year-old Gerald K. Ferrill, is hospitalized in critical but stable condition, police said. Krissinger is being called a hero for saving the driver from certain death inside the vehicle, but he rejects the label. ""I think any police officer would have done the same thing,"" he said. A witness told police that prior to the fire, the truck was driving with a flat tire and loud sounds were coming from the engine. The cause of the fire is under investigation, police said. As for Krissinger, he said he hopes for a speedy recovery for Ferrill, and hopes to meet him someday.","A pickup truck caught fire on the roadway in Cape May .

"(CNN) -- The Miami Heat went cold after 27 consecutive winning games and failed to match the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers' winning streak of 33. The Heat joins many others in and out of sports that have come oh-so-close to the record books. Here are a few examples: . - The New England Patriots fell painfully short of being the second NFL team to ever go through a whole season without losing. The Pats were just two minutes away from winning the Super Bowl in 2008 when New York Giants pulled a miraculous comeback. If the Pats won that game, they would have joined the 1972 Dolphins as the only NFL teams to have a perfect season. - Tiger Woods won seven consecutive PGA Tour events from July 2006 to January 2007. He botched a chance to win an eighth event when he missed a short birdie putt that would have clinched a victory in the third round of a match play tournament. Byron Nelson won 11 straight Tour tournaments in 1945. -This year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average went on a winning streak over 10 consecutive trading sessions, which ended on March 15 when the Dow fell roughly 25 points or 0.2%. It came close to the longest win streak on record of 13 trading sessions in 1987. - Pete Rose had a 44-game hit streak in 1978 that ended against the Atlanta Braves and reliever Gene Garber. After the game, Rose, still 12 games away from Joe DiMaggio's major-league record, fumed that Garber didn't throw fastballs to strike him out. Garber got him out with a slow changeup. -The New York Mets' R.A. Dickey took a run in 2012 at Orel Hershiser's record (set in 1988) of 59 consecutive scoreless innings. Dickey threw 44.2 consecutive scoreless innings from May 22 to June 24 last year. -The Detroit Lions made a run during the 2008-2009 season at the record for most consecutive games lost. They lost 19, finishing second behind the 1976-1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers who lost 26 consecutive games in a row. - Speaking of infamous records, the Charlotte Bobcats came within three games of tying the NBA record of most losses in a row. The embattled team lost 23 straight games at the end of the 2011-12 season. They began the 2012-13 season with a victory over the Indiana Pacers, leaving them three losses short of the 2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers.","The Heat won 27 games in a row .

She's the only woman in the House Republican leadership and has been mentioned as a possible running mate for Mitt Romney. Elected in 2004 to represent the 5th Congressional District in eastern Washington state, McMorris Rodgers has climbed the ranks in Congress, serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and as vice chair of the House Republican Conference. But like many, her work is only part of what defines her. Central in her life are her husband, Brian Rodgers, and their two children, 18-month-old Grace and Cole, 5. McMorris Rodgers holds the distinction of being the only member of Congress to give birth twice while in office. One Friday morning, she invited CNN into her home as the family was getting ready for the day. Like many working moms, she juggles the responsibility of a demanding career and duties of home life. Her husband scrambles eggs on the family's kitchen island countertop, while the congresswoman sits down next to her daughter. ""Do you want some help? You want some help today,"" she asks Grace, taking the spoon. ""There you go. Is that good? How about a little egg?"" she asks. On the other side of the kitchen table sits Cole. In front of him is a piece of paper with alphabet letters. He carefully reproduces the letters as his mom helps him sound them out. ""He's doing well. He's learned his letters. He knows the sounds to the letters and he knows all the uppercase. We're working on the lowercase, and he's starting to read, which is really exciting,"" she says. Early years . Voters in Washington state have been able to follow the personal life of Cathy McMorris. She worked on her family's orchard near Kettle Falls, Washington. She's the first in her family to graduate from college, working her way through Pensacola Christian College in Florida. In 1994, at age 25, she was elected to the Washington Statehouse. A decade later, she arrived in the nation's capital to serve in the U.S. House. ""I was first elected to Congress in 2004 and I was still single. I wondered maybe I would be single for the rest of my life,"" McMorris Rodgers said. ""And then I met Brian. We got married a year later, and soon after that I was pregnant. Cole was born in 2007, and Grace was born in 2010."" Husband Brian is a retired Navy commander, serving 26 years in the service. His father was mayor of Spokane in the early 1970s. Family challenges . When the couple found out they were expecting, they were both thrilled to be first-time parents. ""It was exciting to know I was going to become a mom. There's so much involved in becoming a mom, and it's such a special time, "" McMorris Rodgers said. Her pregnancy was uneventful until her eighth month when doctors said an ultrasound had revealed a blockage in her baby's small intestine. ""They told us, Brian and me, you should know that one out of three babies with this condition is born with Down syndrome."" They didn't have much time to process the news. The next day McMorris Rodgers went into premature labor. ""It was certainly on the forefront of our minds all during labor. It was OK, does my little baby have Down syndrome? "" Cole was born at five pounds, nine ounces. It wasn't immediately apparent if he was born with Trisomy 21, the extra chromosome associated with Down syndrome. Three days later the family received confirmation. ""Boy, that's tough news to receive. It's not what you dream. It's not what you expect. Yes, you're very excited to be a mom, and yet you're faced with a lot of the unknown. I think it's the fear of the unknown that is overwhelming at that point in your life,"" McMorris Rodgers said. Personal cause . Since receiving the news, she has received a lot of support from her constituents and people in the disability community. ""I believe my eyes have been open. I just view life from a totally different perspective. I was welcomed by the disability community, and they see the best in what every person has to offer."" Her initial fear has been replaced with resolve. In 2008, she co-founded the bipartisan Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus. She has taken up a leading cause of the disability community, co-sponsoring a bill called the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act. It would modify the Internal Revenue Service code to allow parents of children with disabilities to set aside money in tax-free accounts for future education, housing and transportation needs. The accounts would be modeled after current 401(k) retirement and 529 college plans. ""We have hopes and dreams for Cole, and we want him to be all that he can be, and we want to give him the strong foundation so that he can pursue a job and hopefully independent life,"" McMorris Rodgers said. Brian Rodgers added, ""Like any parent, you want them to reach their highest potential."" Life as mom . ""Cole, do you like music? Can you put music on,"" McMorris Rodgers asks. Cole reaches for a CD. ""Oh, oh,"" she says, glancing at her husband. ""He has Bruce Srpingsteen. He loves Springsteen. It's just a little loud for the morning."" Cole starts rocking out on the couch, his blond hair shaking to the music, while his sister bounces nearby. The family made the decision to enroll Cole in a public charter school in Washington. On normal days the kids wake up early around 6:30 a.m. ""They're a nice alarm clock. They kind of take turns getting up,"" she says smiling at her two children. She and Brian both pitch in helping get the children dressed and ready for the day. Brian leaves to take Cole to school, which starts at 8:45 a.m., and the congresswoman has some one-on-one time with her daughter. When Brian returns, she heads off to her Capitol Hill office. He stays home with the kids. ""I spent 26 years in the Navy. So this is a lot like the Navy,"" he jokes. ""It's dynamic, it's interesting and there's a purpose to it."" The congresswoman shuttles back to her district in Spokane on weekends. Sometimes she takes the kids with her. Her mother lives there and is happy to see the grandchildren. Finding time to get it all done isn't easy. But the couple try. ""Thursday night is date night. So when I'm in town and don't have votes, we have date night. ... That's our night,"" McMorris Rodgers said. Life may get even more topsy-turvy for McMorris Rodgers. Her name comes up repeatedly as a possible vice presidential pick for Romney, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee. The family deals with it by trying to be as flexible as possible. ""The schedule is always changing, fluid. We try to schedule things as much as possible in advance. But there's always things coming up. Fortunately, they've been pretty good travelers. They don't know any differently."" Revving up for another campaign season, McMorris Rodgers says she's ready. ""This will be the first campaign season for Grace."" And Cole -- expect to see him charming the crowds. ""He loves parades. He loves to be in a parade and wave and dance to music. He's a natural."" Lisa Sylvester is a CNN correspondent.

"(CNN) -- After the year he's had, no one could blame Justin Bieber if he really does want to retire. The 19-year-old has spent the past 12 months stuck in a public storm of negative press, bad decisions, ailments and misfires, all while trying to scrub off the sheen of his tween popularity. With a barely there 'stache lingering on his upper lip, the pop star has spent 2013 attempting to assert his manhood and find a bridge over to the adult side of the pop world -- all without completely disregarding the persona or the young fans that helped him become a star in the first place. It's a delicate and practically impossible balance, a tightrope that Bieber, his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez, and some cohorts like Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande have all walked this year to varying degrees of success. Gomez, now 21, has long shed the role that made her famous with younger crowds, that of Alex Russo on the Disney Channel's ""Wizards of Waverly Place."" Even as she grew more recognizable thanks to Disney's marketing prowess, Gomez was never solely definable by the series -- there were departures for albums with her band, Selena Gomez & the Scene, and movies like 2011's ""Monte Carlo."" But even with those efforts, Gomez began 2013 with a still-intact image as a young adult star. Although she's in the same age group as her BFF Taylor Swift, Gomez didn't enjoy the same broad demographic appeal. Then March brought Harmony Korine's ""Spring Breakers,"" a sly project aimed directly at the nexus of emerging womanhood. Alongside one actress who's already come out on the other side of the teen star transition, Vanessa Hudgens, and one who stands on the cusp, Ashley Benson of ""Pretty Little Liars,"" Gomez put on a string bikini and struck the requisite provocative poses. It was the kind of risque territory that legions of adolescent stars before her have eagerly walked into, because it always sends a crystal clear message: I'm not a kid anymore, and it's time you started treating me like an adult artist. ""The transition's weird and it's awkward,"" Gomez told CNN of trying to mature in the spotlight with projects like ""Spring Breakers."" ""You don't really know what the right and wrong thing to do is when you do it, but you can just do projects that you're really passionate about and this was something that I was definitely excited to be a part of."" Go back roughly 10 years and you would have heard something similar from a then 21-year-old Britney Spears, who caused her own uproar when she kissed Madonna at the MTV Video Music Awards. ""Honestly, it's about me just performing and expressing myself,"" she told CNN of the backlash to her ""adult"" behavior, which at the time left some, including this network, questioning how the change in the former Mouseketeer's image would affect her young fans. Although Spears herself perhaps put it best when she said, ""I'm not a girl; not yet a woman,"" she wasn't the only one struggling. Around the same time, Christina Aguilera was ""Dirrtying"" up her reputation with chaps and explicit lyrics, and Spears' ex-boyfriend, Justin Timberlake, was in the midst of reforming himself from a boy band member to bonafide pop star by promising to have his love interest ""naked by the end of this song."" He took his freshly cultivated sex appeal a step too far at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show, when he assisted in Janet Jackson's ""wardrobe malfunction."" But if there's any comfort to be had for today's young celebrities, it's that each of those singers has been able to move past that ""weird and awkward"" phase Gomez described. Bieber especially is probably relieved to see that Timberlake survived that enormous scandal to dominate the charts years later with ""The 20/20 Experience."" In Bieber's case, he can end the year satisfied that he has stretched himself enough artistically to gain positive attention for an older sound, even if the world isn't quite ready to accept the adult artist he's becoming. Bieber never had to contend with being a part of what's referred to as the ""Disney machine,"" but he did become very famous very quickly at a very young age. Chances are it's still difficult for the average adult older than 21 to name a Bieber hit that isn't ""Baby"" or ""One Less Lonely Girl,"" two songs that helped launch his career when he was 15. So when he says he plans to retire -- which he's done repeatedly in the weeks leading up to the end of the year in what may or may not be an extended prank that his rep won't comment on -- perhaps it's more likely that he doesn't want to quit singing but just wants to retire that old, floppy-haired image. In some ways he's done that, even if it was inadvertently, with the constant topless photos he's shared, his altercations with paparazzi, and the salacious rumors that dogged the South American stretch of his tour this year. The music he's created -- sultry songs about love, heartbreak and pillow talk, with a suggestive video to match -- have only further shown his willingness to leave the kids' table. One of his tour companions, Ariana Grande, has shown the same desire in a much more subtle way. At 20, Grande is best known to the under-18s as Nickelodeon's Cat Valentine on the network's ""Victorious"" and ""Sam & Cat."" But with the release of her debut album, ""Yours Truly,"" in August, Grande proved she's ready and capable to handle an older audience. She did that not with the usual scandals but with a No. 1 album that gained her entrée to larger platforms, such as a performance at the 2013 American Music Awards that earned praise from the likes of Lady Gaga and Kelly Clarkson. The Disney Channel says it's aware of the rocky terrain that lies ahead for kids who want a career beyond the network's family-friendly realm. According to Patti McTeague, the senior vice president of Kids Communications for Disney ABC Television Group, the Disney Channel doesn't try to ""control or dictate an actor's image"" while they're working with the company, although they do offer a ""Talent 101"" orientation to help the budding star prepare for what's ahead. Outside that guidance, though, McTeague said in a statement that ""the talent has the control over their career; we want them to be obligated to the art of their craft not obligated to us. We recognize we are working with young people at a transition in their personal development -- aka, teenagers -- and we trust parents of employed minors to support and guide their kids."" And, when the time comes that said talent wants to move on from Disney, ""we don't try to slow the hands of time,"" she continued. ""Hopefully, these young actors continue to follow their dreams, explore roles that make sense for them and take their career to the next level."" For at least one former Disney name, Miley Cyrus, making that leap to a new level meant burning down that Mouse House image altogether. The 21-year-old has been trying to liberate herself from her ""Hannah Montana"" past for years, but it wasn't until 2013 when she was fully able to, in her own words, kill off the character who made her famous. With a new aesthetic, a discovered fondness for suggestive photography, an unfiltered Twitter account and a bold approach to stealing the limelight at each and every awards show that had her on the bill, Cyrus cheerfully let her prior kid-friendly image go up in flames. Although the public stood by and watched like a collective set of exasperated parents, Cyrus is entering 2014 with her mission accomplished. The shock value of seeing a singer and actress who was once the idol of nearly every 9-year-old in America swing naked from a wrecking ball has sunk in; there's little, if anything else, she needs to do to assert her adult independence. The transition, for Cyrus at least, is complete.","This year, a number of teen stars tried to transition to adult fame .
