"Eden Hazard has hailed Diego Costa as an inspiration to Chelsea after the striker's controversial role in helping the Blues to the Capital One Cup final at the expense of Liverpool. The uncompromising forward was a menace throughout Tuesday night's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg, but could miss Saturday's Premier League title bout with Manchester City through suspension following apparent stamps on Emre Can and Martin Skrtel. 'When you play with this guy, you have to give everything,' Hazard said of Costa. Eden Hazard fires in shot on goal during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool . Diego Costa (left) was an absolute menace to Liverpool throughout Tuesday evening's match . 'You can see in every action and for every ball, he gives his life. 'Even if he didn't score against Liverpool, he gave his life. For us, for the players, when you play with him, it's very good. 'In training he is a little different but in the game he is very good. He never stops. He had a very good mentality against Liverpool. 'We need him because he can score every minute, every second. He did very well.' Jose Mourinho defended Costa's footwork as 'absolutely accidental' after the match and reserved particular praise for Branislav Ivanovic, whose white boot was blood-stained and should be showcased for Chelsea's young players as an example, the Blues boss said. Chelsea players Hazard, Oscar and Branislav Ivanovic celebrate Chelsea getting to the Capital One Cup final . Costa showed his dark side with this stamp on Martin Skrtel, for which he was somehow not sent off . Ivanovic's extra-time header earned a 2-1 aggregate win and a place in the March 1 final at Wembley. Sheffield United or Tottenham, who play on Wednesday night, will be the opponents, with Hazard hoping Chelsea can make amends for the 5-3 New Year's Day loss to Spurs. The Belgian said: 'Yes, to get revenge - it'd be good. We have to. 'But it doesn't matter if it's Tottenham or the other one, we have to win the final.' Serbia defender Ivanovic believes Chelsea showed their true force against the Reds and warned Manchester City there is more to come. 'We showed the real power of our team and in the end deserved to be in the final,' Ivanovic told Chelsea TV. 'We know we can improve and we'll improve in the next couple of games.' Chelsea bounced back from the shock FA Cup elimination to League One Bradford as Mourinho made nine changes to his starting line-up. The 26-year-old also appeared to stamp on Emre Can's right leg during the fiery cup clash . Costa and Skrtel square up after anothet incident, for which the striker avoided a card . Worryingly for Gary Cahill, he was not in Chelsea's team, dropping to the substitutes' bench after a series of below-par displays, including against Bradford. Kurt Zouma stepped up and performed well against Raheem Sterling, who scored Liverpool's first-leg goal at Anfield as Cahill backed off. 'Nobody enjoys to play against Sterling, because he is so, so quick,' Mourinho told Chelsea TV. 'Zouma was very, very focused, very concentrated on the job he had to do. Zouma did fantastic.' With City visiting Stamford Bridge on Saturday, Premier League leaders Chelsea could have done without the extra half hour of play. The Blues hold a five-point lead which could be increased to eight, or fall to two, on Saturday evening. Mourinho played down concerns of tiredness and thanked the supporters after the humiliating loss to Bradford. He said: 'The players are tired but when you win fatigue doesn't mean the same as when you lose. 'We have a big game on Saturday, but I think the feeling of winning, being at Wembley, compensates a little bit the fans after the gift we gave them last weekend. 'For our fans, after Saturday, the best thing to happen is now we go to Wembley.' Ivanovic's right boot was bloodied come the end of the match after giving his all throughout . Young defender Kurt Zouma impressed for Chelsea against Brendan Rodgers' side . Simon Mignolet was much-improved for the Reds in their narrow loss at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night . The tie might have been settled sooner had the goalkeepers not made crucial interventions. Thibaut Courtois saved well from Alberto Moreno and Philippe Coutinho, while Simon Mignolet twice denied Costa. Liverpool's trophy hopes now rely on the FA Cup, with Bolton waiting in a fourth-round replay. First the Reds play West Ham in the Premier League, where a top-four spot and Champions League qualification is the target. Mignolet told liverpoolfc.com: 'The most important thing is that we have to go again on Saturday in the Premier League and then the FA Cup after that. We have to pick ourselves up and go again. 'Everybody is disappointed when you go out of a competition that you want to win, and especially with the effort and performances that we put in over the two legs. 'We definitely deserved more than we got. But we have to accept it and move on, and make sure that we go again in the other competitions that we're still playing in.'","Chelsea beat Liverpool to progress to the Capital One Cup final .

"France head coach Philippe Saint-Andre believes his team's RBS 6 Nations encounter with Scotland will give the country a chance to come together following the spate of recent militant attacks. Seventeen people were killed in France across three days earlier this month after attacks on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, police officers and a kosher supermarket. Les Bleus host Scotland at Stade de France on February 7 in the team's opening game of the tournament, and Saint-Andre expects the fixture to be a 'very emotional' occasion. France coach Philippe Saint Andre poses with Thierry Dusautoir during the Six Nations launch . Saint Andre (centre) hopes the tournament can bring a grieving nation together . 'I am definitely sure the Marseillaise against Scotland will be very emotional,' Saint-Andre said. 'It was a very, very tough time, but everybody stuck together and demonstrated how proud we are of our country and very proud of our different cultures. 'All the crowd and French public will be 150 percent behind the French team.' Saint-Andre continued: 'I am always proud to sing the national anthem. 'French society has people from different origins. It is nice to see the team working like this in a good way and and the team is representative of French society. 'It will be a nice moment to enjoy being together, to show our pride in being French. Saint Andre says that the crowd and French public will be '150 per cent' behind the team . 'Sport is nice in this way. It allows us to take this moment to share and to be part of the community.' France have not won the Six Nations since 2010 and have finished fourth or lower in each of the past three competitions. Saint-Andre, however, reckons his team are one of four sides capable of lifting the trophy this year. 'I think our front five is as strong as England and Ireland,' he said. 'But, as we get closer to the World Cup, it looks like all the countries get closer. France's Yoann Huget breaks away to score against Scotland in last year's Six Nations . 'It is very difficult to say who will win the Six Nations. Four countries can win the tournament. 'We need to be more precise with our set-piece. Last year we missed a penalty against Ireland and that was the difference between finishing first and fourth.

"CLICK HERE to read Pete Jenson's full match report . Cristiano Ronaldo suffered a very public meltdown after lashing out THREE times before being sent off during Real Madrid's 2-1 victory over Cordoba. The Portuguese superstar had endured a miserable afternoon - that included being overshadowed by former Manchester United misfit Bebe - before he let his frustration get the better of him late in the game. In an astonishing sequence of events, Ronaldo was initially unfortunate not to be sent off after taking a full-blooded swing at Jose Angel Crespo, which fortunately for the Cordoba defender was as accurate as the Real striker's shooting during the game.

"Sean O'Brien is on course to feature in the first half of Ireland's RBS 6 Nations title defence, according to boss Joe Schmidt. The 27-year-old flanker is primed to end 14 months of injury woes by featuring for the Irish Wolfhounds against England Saxons on Friday night. O'Brien has endured two bouts of surgery on the same shoulder since his last Test action, in Ireland's 24-22 New Zealand defeat in November 2013. Sean O'Brien (left) has been out of action for 14 months but is set to play for the Irish Wolfhounds on Friday . The bullish British and Irish Lion could now make his long-awaited full Test return in either Ireland's second-round clash with France or their March 1 showdown with England. 'Sean trained fully on Tuesday to be honest,' said head coach Schmidt, as Ireland prepare to open their campaign in Italy on February 7. 'So we'd be hopeful that he'd be involved in the first half of the Six Nations.' Ireland boss Joe Schmidt (right) is confident that O'Brien will be able to feature in Ireland's Six Nation defence . O'Brien's club Leinster believe the combative loose forward could feature in Pro12 action against Newport Gwent Dragons on February 15. Ireland host France in Dublin on Saturday, February 14, so if O'Brien is embroiled in club action that weekend, his Test return would then come against England. Schmidt's Ireland side entertain England in Dublin when this year's Six Nations reaches its midway point, and O'Brien's return would prove a tangible mid-tournament boost. Schmidt's Ireland travel to Rome to play Italy in their first game of the Six Nations on February 7 . Loosehead prop Cian Healy has been battling hamstring problems since September, and is another aiming to return to the Test arena during the upcoming competition. Schmidt still believes Healy will feature during the tournament, but sounded a note of caution in respect of the destructive ball-carrying front-rower. Schmidt vowed not to take any risks with his crop of stars working their way back to fitness, especially in World Cup year. Loosehead prop Cian Healy is another player who Ireland are hoping will be involved in the competition . 'We're still hopeful that Cian may have an involvement as well,' said Schmidt. 'Cian looks in great shape; he's just got to hit a few markers to finish off his full recovery. 'Because one thing we don't want to do is to have someone reinjure themselves and therefore put themselves out for an extended period of time. 'So we're very much Six Nations-focused but it's a massive year, and what we can't afford to do is worsen a situation for a player with an injury.' Schmidt moved to allay fears surrounding the severity of scrum-half Conor Murray's neck problem, tipping the Munster half back to recover in time to face the Italians. Murray has disc trouble in his neck, but Schmidt believes this has been caused by bruising and swelling: if both subside in time, the British Lions playmaker should be ready to start the tournament. 'Conor is feeling really good, we're quietly confident,' said Schmidt. 'He's got a few more things to tick off and he will be scanned again by the end of the week. Conor Murray is set for a scan this week but Schmidt is confident that Munster scrum half will feature . 'And by Monday we'd like to have a clear picture so we can have uninterrupted preparation for Italy, but at the moment we're hopeful he'll be okay. 'If you get bruising, bruising causes swelling, and swelling causes discomfort. 'That's a layman's view of what Conor has got presently, so we're hopeful that will dissipate, and has dissipated over a period of time since it first happened.'","Sean O'Brien on course to play a part in Ireland's Six Nations Title defence .

"Adrian Chiles could take legal action over his departure as ITV's lead football host, it was claimed on BBC Radio 4's Media Show. It was announced on Friday that Mark Pougatch will take over from Chiles with immediate effect, and after ITV refused to comment on the departure, Radio 4's Steve Hewlett expects lawyers to get involved.

Chiles was given a one-year contract extension shortly before the World Cup last year, and it is understood that he was told last week that ITV wanted to terminate it. It was a one-year deal worth around £500,000  just to host football. He  had to take a £1million cut in salary at that time as he was no longer hosting the doomed Daybreak breakfast show.

"Tiger Woods was in attendance as his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn produced a far from toothless display on the ski slopes in Italy on Monday. The former world No 1 golfer, widely regarded as one of the best ever to play the game, was wrapped up in a scarf and hat as he witnessed Vonn achieve her 63rd World Cup win, but he was missing one of his front teeth. Mark Steinberg, his agent at Excel Sports, explained the missing tooth in an email. He says during a crush of photographers at the awards podium, a media member with a shoulder-mounted video surged toward the stage, turned and hit Woods in the mouth. That's what knocked out the tooth. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tiger Woods kiss Lindsey Vonn as she wins the Super-G . As Tiger Woods watched on in Italy, it became apparent that he was missing one of his front teeth . After girlfriend Lindsey Vonn made alpine skiing history, she embraced Woods at the finish line . He did not say when Woods would have it replaced. Golf's biggest star returns to competition next week in Phoenix, and his smile is sure to produce a stream of shutters from the cameras. Woods endured an injury-plagued 2014 season, in which he only played nine tournaments, but is back fit and will begin 2015 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open at the end of January. For now, though, he is with Vonn in Italy as she made history by settig a new record for women's alpine skiing World Cup wins in the super-G at Cortia d'Ampezzo. As Woods watched on, photographers caught a glimpse of what looks like a gap where a  front-left tooth should be. On the slopes, Vonn finished 0.85 seconds ahead of Austria's Anna Fenninger, with Liechenstein's Tina Weirather in third. Woods was driven around the course by a marshal as he watched his girlfriend make history . Woods flashed a toothless grin as he was taken around the Cortina d'Ampezzo course in Italy on Monday . Vonn had equalled the 35-year-old win record set by Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell by winning the World Cup downhill race at the same venue on Sunday. The four-times overall World Cup winner and 2010 Olympic champion returned this season after a year out with knee injuries sustained in a crash at the 2013 World Championships in Schladming.

"Real Sociedad's bid to climb away from the La Liga relegation places suffered a setback when they were beaten 1-0 at home by Rayo Vallecano on Saturday and were roundly whistled by their own fans. Sociedad have stabilised since former Manchester United and Everton manager David Moyes took over in November after a poor start to the campaign but their latest setback comes after they were knocked out of the King's Cup by Villarreal on Wednesday. Rayo secured the points at Sociedad's Anoeta stadium in San Sebastian when Angola forward Manucho outjumped the home defence at an 81st-minute corner and headed past goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli. Real Sociedad manager David Moyes (centre) takes an opportunity to speak to midfielder Xabi Prieto (right) Rayo Vallecano goalscorer Manucho (left) leaps over Real Sociedad goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli . It was no more than Rayo deserved after a generally poor performance from Sociedad, who lacked creativity and penetration in attack, and showed Moyes has plenty of work to do if the Basques are to secure their top-flight status. After whistles rang out around the ground on the final whistle, defender Jon Ansotegi told Spanish television he could not explain why Sociedad had managed to beat Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid at the Anoeta but were unable to see off sides of lesser calibre.

With their campaign at the halfway mark, Sociedad are 12th on 19 points from 19 matches, three points above the drop zone. Rayo are ninth on 23 points.

"Dejan Lovren's reputation as a hardened  defender was slightly tarnished after the Liverpool star revealed his love for collecting Kinder Surprise toys. The Croatia international showed off his somewhat worrying obsession with the miniature self assembly figurines that come packaged inside chocolate eggs by posting a picture of his collection on Instagram. The image of around 70 carefully assembled small, cute animals was accompanied by a caption in his native Croatian that complained about the time it takes to build the toys - while declaring himself a 'true collector'. Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren posted a picture of his Kinder Surprise collection on Instagram . The Croatia international has struggled to nail down a starting place since his move to Anfield . Lovren did come on for Liverpool's last game against Sunderland to help earn a 1-0 victory . The former Southampton defender arrived at Anfield in a £20million move last summer but has failed to make an impact and recently lost his place in the starting XI, which may have freed some time to engage in his hobby. The centre-back has not started a game since Liverpool lost to Manchester United on December 21, although he did come on to replace Steven Gerrard as a precaution in the Reds' last game against Sunderland. Whether  eating the chocolate that encases the toys is associated with Lovren's dip in form is not known.","Dejan Lovren revealed he is a 'true collector' of Kinder Surprise toys .

"West Bromwich Albion fans were treated to almost half-an-hour of club coverage on Sky Sports News this afternoon, while fans of other clubs wondered what on earth was wrong with their television. It was probably the most coverage the club has had in years, but even the most hardened of Baggies’ fans will have grown tired of the Tony Pulis video feature as it was played on loop for what seemed an eternity. Many Twitter users wondered what was going on down at Sky Sports HQ and why they were being subjected to so much Pulis time, but it soon became apparent when the cameras started rolling live again, almost 30 minutes later.

"As the refereeing fraternity comes under increasing pressure, Sportsmail reveals the shocking disparity between the wages earned by Premier League officials and those who work more in the Football League. Select Group referees — operating mostly in the Premier League — are believed to earn a basic salary of around £65,000 per year, while they also receive fees in excess of £1,000 per game in the top flight. If they were to officiate 38 games in a season, it would bring their overall pay to more than £100,000. Referees on the National Group — operating in the Football League — are not on contracts and are paid in the region of £380 a match. They sign up to the National Group on the equivalent of a freelance basis. If they were to officiate the 46 games in a Football League season, they would receive £17,480. Top Premier League referees like Phil Dowd (centre) can earn up to £100,000 per year in wages . Referees lower down the football food chain earn far less, with potential earnings of around £17,000 per year . Assistant referees on the National List are paid as little as £185 per match while fourth officials receive £110. So an assistant referee in the Championship would receive only £8,510 for a 46-game season but no retainer in the summer months. In many cases, it will be less because assistant referees are not guaranteed a game in the Football League every week and will also combine fourth-official duties and officiating in non-League games. One assistant estimated that his yearly earnings would be closer to £5,000. There is also no sliding scale between the Championship and League Two and Sportsmail’s calculations demonstrate that there could, in theory, be an £80,000 gap in pay between refereeing regularly in the Premier League and the Championship. Football League officials tend to work on a freelance basis meaning it is harder to get regular work . The Select Group and National Group fall under the jurisdiction of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL). The organisation declined to comment on the chasm in wages but they take the view that the rates differ between contracted workers and freelance employers as they would in any other industry. It means that most National Group officials have a job and referee as a hobby and one source admitted that there have been occasions when they have seen officials ‘extremely tired’ after working a five-day week and then refereeing. The Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) refused to comment on the huge wage disparity . The lower pay in the Football League is thought to be one reason why there are so few good referees coming through the system. It is also hard to dislodge the top-flight referees, who are determined to stay where they earn the big money. The Football League say it is an ongoing debate as to whether more officials should be made professional. The wage discrepancy represents a fresh blow to the credibility of the PGMOL after a festive period that saw a litany of errors by Premier League referees. It led Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll to call for the sacking of Mike Riley, the head of the PGMOL. The PGMOL has been under fire from critics following a string of refereeing errors over the festive period .","Sportsmail reveals the huge wage disparity between football referees .

"Frank Lampard may not have moved to New York just quite yet but his soon-to-be team-mate David Villa has landed in America ahead of the new season. Villa, who joined New York City FC on a three-year deal in June, posted an Instagram picture of himself at the Rockefeller Center.

Frank Lampard will join up with his new team-mates in July after extending his deal at Manchester City . And Villa insists the MLS is not a step down from his time at the likes of Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Valencia. Villa, speaking to the Wall Street Journal, said of his move to the US: 'Football players never talk about steps forward or steps back. It makes little sense among athletes. 'For me, the MLS league is a league that today is not at the height of the European league but may be in the future, and nothing is a step backward. 'I see it as an advance in my career, and I hope this step ahead from Europe to America is important for me.' Villa insists his move to the MLS is not a step down from playing for the likes of Atletico and Barcelona . Former Spain forward Villa has revealed he has already settled into life in the Big Apple after moving to America at the back end of 2014. He added: 'I’ve been living here since September. In September the girls started school. In October I went to play with the other team [Melbourne City], but since September we are based in the city of New York. 'We are very happy and excited, and we hope it stays that way in the future.'

"Chelsea star Cesc Fabregas is enjoying some time away from the cold British weather as he relaxes on a Caribbean island with his girlfriend Daniella Semaan. With the Blues flying high at the top of the Premier League, Jose Mourinho has allowed his players a short break away from west London, with Spaniard Fabregas opting to whisk his partner to Saint Barthelemy. The pair frolicked in the sea, before basking in 30 degree heat on the French island... a far cry from the wind and rain of the English capital. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas holds girlfriend Daniella Semaan's hand in the Caribbean sea . The pair frolicked in the water, enjoying their short break, before bathing in the 30 degree St Bart's heat . Fabregas has been a mainstay in the Chelsea side this season, featuring in 27 matches already . Mourinho's side have won 15 of their first 21 Premier League games, losing just two in the process. After a disappointing defeat by Tottenham, the Blues returned to winning ways last weekend, brushing Newcastle aside at Stamford Bridge. The 5-3 loss to Spurs on New Year's Day was a shock to the Chelsea system, but Fabregas insists that they did not get complacent ahead of the game. 'There is never complacency at Chelsea, we just want to win every game,' Fabregas told the Evening Standard. 'Of course that's not possible through the season, there are many, many games. Fabregas bathed in the sea in Saint Barthelemy, a French island in the Caribbean, with his girlfriend . A view of the beach shows the luxurious surroundings that Fabregas treated his partner to this week . When Fabregas returns to the English capital, he and his Chelsea team-mates travel to Swansea on Saturday . 'Losing to Tottenham like we did was a shock, but when you watch the game again you see that every chance they had, they scored. 'It was one of those days where we hit the post, Ramires and Cesar Azpilicueta also had a chance. Things didn't go our way, but credit to Tottenham, they played a good game. But that's it, we are just looking to move forward now.' Mourinho's side played four matches in just 11 days over the Christmas period, and Fabregas, as a mainstay in this season's Chelsea line-up, was one of a number of players given some time off. John Terry and Eden Hazard are away from west London too, while Nemanja Matic, Branislav Ivanovic, Willian and Diego Costa were all dropped to the bench for Chelsea's FA Cup tie against Watford to enable them to recharge their batteries. Fabregas helped Chelsea to a 2-0 win over Newcastle at Stamford Bridge last time out . The 27-year-old Spain midfielder cosied up to girlfriend Semaan in the water on the island of St Bart's . After bathing in the water, the pair took to sun beds on the beach to top up their tan before heading home . Chelsea are just two points ahead of reigning champions Manchester City in the Premier League, whom they face on January 31. On Saturday, Fabregas and his Blues team-mates will make the trip to south Wales, where they face a mid-table Swansea side without a win since Boxing Day. Mourinho will surely be hoping that a refreshed and recharged Fabregas can help his team to all three points at the Liberty Stadium.","Chelsea played four times in 11 days over a hectic Christmas period .

'With Arouna Kone being fully fit, I see him as a replacement for Samuel's position and it is more about trying to get the players back from injury.

A few seconds later, however, Ivanovic had drifted behind his marker and fired in what turned out to be the winning goal in Chelsea's 1-0 victory. But was Balotelli solely to blame? Sportsmail columnist and former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher disagrees, instead highlighting faults in Liverpool's zonal marking system. Steven Gerrard, Lucas, Balotelli all line up in front of Chelsea's first attacker Ivanovic . As Willian takes his free-kick, Ivanovic moves behind his original marker Balotelli . Gerrard and Lucas are marking 'zones' with no Chelsea players in them due to poor positioning . Balotelli moves forward as Diego Costa goes into his 'zone' 'It's not Mario's fault the goal! In zonal defence you attack the space in front of you! Costa goes in front of him so he goes with him,' Carragher wrote on kicca. 'The fault initially is Gerrard, Lucas & Mario should all come back 3 yards so Stevie is in Lucas position etc. 'As Willian takes it there are 3 Chelsea players between Mario & Johnson/Skrtel that's the problem those 2 are wrong side so there's too much space for them to run into.' Indeed, replays of the goal seem to back up Carragher's assertions as Steven Gerrard and Lucas's starting position mean Willian's ball drifts completely past them into an area where Chelsea's players have plenty of room to run in to. As Liverpool line up to to defend the free-kick, Jordan Henderson is marking Diego Costa . But as the ball comes in to the box, Henderson fails to track Costa's run . Henderson's is left back near the penalty spot, while Costa has moved into Balotelli's zone . Balotelli jumps with Costa, leaving Ivanovic with a free header to score . In effect, Gerrard and Lucas were defending 'zones' they did not need too as Chelsea had no players in or attacking that space. Therefore, as Carragher says, Liverpool's line should have moved three yards back. Balotelli, meanwhile, can be seen stepping forward and challenging Diego Costa as the Chelsea striker moves into his 'zone' after losing his marker Jordan Henderson. Had Henderson stayed with Costa then Balotelli may not have had to step forward and may have been better positioned to challenge Ivanovic. Balotelli must take responsibility for his lack of movement during his brief cameo at Stamford Bridge, but to blame him for the goal - is that really fair?","Mario Balotelli was initially marking Branislav Ivanovic from free-kick .

"Samuel Eto'o has completed his move from Everton to Sampdoria, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal. The 33-year-old striker joined the Toffees on a free transfer in August and leaves after scoring four goals in 20 appearances. Everton boss Roberto Martinez told the club website: 'We thank Samuel for his efforts and for bringing his know-how to the team and to (Everton's training ground) Finch Farm, where he passed on some of his terrific experience to all of the young players in particular. Samuel Eto'o (right) announced on his Instagram page that he had completed his move to Sampdoria . Eto'o trained with his new team mates following his move to the Europe-chasing Serie A side . 'The memory of his performances in Europe stand out especially. On behalf of all Evertonians, we wish him well for the next chapter in his career.' It was reported last week that Eto'o had already agreed a contract with the Serie A side, accepting a 40 per cent pay cut, but the deal stalled, with Sampdoria complaining about a lack of clarity in their dealings with Everton. On Saturday, the Genoa club published a picture of the four-time African Footballer of the Year in their colours and Everton confirmed on Tuesday that Eto'o has returned to Italy on a three-and-a-half-year deal. Everton boss Roberto Martinez thanked Eto'o for his efforts and wished him well on his move to Serie A . The former Cameroon international spent two years with Inter Milan between 2009 and 2011 before moving on to Anzhi Makhachkala and then Chelsea. Following his release by the Blues at the end of last season, Eto'o opted to stay in the Premier League and declared on his arrival at Goodison Park: ""I am here for two years and hope to be here for a lot more."" Eto'o scored in his first game for Everton against Chelsea and also netted against Krasnodar in the Europa League as well as scoring a brace in a 3-1 victory over Burnley. The 33-year-old (right) was brought in to bring goals following the sale of top scorer Manolo Gabbiadini . But he was in and out of the side as Martinez's team struggled for form and made his last appearance as a substitute in the 1-1 FA Cup draw with West Ham on January 6. Sampdoria were looking to strengthen their forward line after selling top scorer Manolo Gabbiadini to Napoli earlier this month. The Genoa outfit, coached by Sinisa Mihajlovic, are fifth in Serie A, level on 34 points with fourth-placed Lazio and two points adrift of Napoli.

"It was so nearly the ultimate fairytale for Che Adams, who came off the bench to score two goals for Sheffield United in their semi-final with Tottenham. His immediate impact, and first two goals for the club, nearly rescued the Capital One Cup tie for the Blades before Christian Eriksen's late heroics guided Spurs into the final. But who is the 18-year-old striker who only joined the League One side in November? Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on Sheffield United's cup sensation. Che Adams came off the bench to score two goals for Sheffield United against Tottenham Hotspur . SO WHO IS SHEFFIELD UNITED’S TWO-GOAL HERO? His full name is Che Zach Everton Fred Adams, the 18-year-old striker was snapped up by the Blades in November. SHOULD I HAVE HEARD OF HIM? Probably not. He was playing for non-League Ilkeston FC before moving to the League One side, though he was heavily scouted by the likes of Southampton, Burnley, Sunderland, Norwich and Rangers. His Blades career had seen him play just three times previously but he did make his debut in the 1-0 win over Southampton in the Capital One Cup quarter-final as a half-time substitute. Adams came on as a substitute for Sheffield United in the 74th minute and scored three minutes later after finishing neatly across Michel Vorm's goal following a low far post cross . Adams celebrates scoring his first goal for the club which levelled the scores on the night at 1-1 . DIDN'T COVENTRY CITY LET HIM SLIP THROUGH THE NET? Adams was on the books at the Sky Blues before they released him, and his form became so impressive in the non-league ranks that up to 45 scouts were watching him at one point. HE TOOK HIS GOALS AGAINST SPURS WELL, BUT IS THERE MORE TO HIS GAME? Indeed there is. His strike record was impressive at Ilkeston with nine goals in 16 games, but he also contributed with 11 assist during that period too. WHAT ARE HIS STRONGEST ABILITIES? It's best to let his former manager Kevin Wilson give a lowdown on that. Wilson was excited about the striker's potential after he sold him to Sheffield United back in November. The second goal for Adams came just two minutes after his first, a low drive inside the box deflected past Vorm by Tottenham Hotspur defender Eric Dier (right) Spurs midfielder Paulinho stands dejected as Adams celebrates scoring the Blades' second goal of the evening to give them a 2-1 lead - a scoreline which would have earned the League One side extra time . Sheffield United players congratulate Adams following his immediate impact, before Christian Eriksen restored Spurs' aggregate lead in the Capital One Cup semi-final . 'Che is one of those players that comes along every so often and makes you think, ‘wow’,” said Wilson in an interview with The Star. 'He’s got pace in abundance, but he’s really powerful too. I remember a goal he scored against FC United of Manchester, where he picked the ball up in his own half, drove at their defence and finished in the bottom corner. 'His biggest asset is that knack of changing games in the blink of an eye. He stands defenders up and then leaves them for dead. In fact, I’d say he’s capable of doing things that I haven’t seen players do for a long, long time.' ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HIM? Adams has already been earmarked to play for Antigua and Barbuda at international level and was formally called up to the England C team last October. He is also eligible to represent Scotland. Adams applauds fans following the second leg semi-final clash having caused Spurs an almighty scare . Sheffield United boss Nigel Clough instructs his team during the cup tie, with the Blades boss having signed Adams from Ilkeston in November .","Che Adams scored twice for Sheffield United against Tottenham Hotspur .

"Someone call Chas 'n' Dave. Spurs are on their way to Wembley. They have an Argentine at the controls and Mauricio Pochettino can be forgiven if his knees are still trembling when he gets there. Tottenham were coasting serenely towards a March 1 date with Chelsea, with a two-goal aggregate lead and only 13 minutes to go against their opponents from League One. Enter Che Adams, a teenage Arsenal supporter who was signed from Ilkeston and who delivered two goals in 140 seconds which turned everything upside down and brought Bramall Lane to life again. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Sheffield United 2-2 Tottenham . Christian Eriksen scores Tottenham's opening goal at Bramall Lane against League One club Sheffield United . Eriksen's stunning free-kick doubled Tottenham's lead on aggregate against their League One opposition on Wednesday night .

Referee: Mike Dean 6.5 . Attendance: 30,236 . For nine minutes, the tie was bound for extra-time and Sheffield United had confidence restored to levels where they could imagine their first major final since 1936. Enter Christian Eriksen (again) with his second of the night, a clinical finish arrowed inside the post after Harry Kane had split an open defence with a pass. Eriksen’s first had been a delicious free-kick, curled into the top corner, in the first-half, but it was the second which clinched it. This was the fourth time this season the Dane has scored in the 87th minute of a match and it meant there was no way back for Sheffield United. Spurs celebrated as the snow started to settle on the pitch, before they returned south where they can prepare for a rematch of the 2008 final, when they beat Chelsea to win this competition. It was the last major trophy they delivered to White Hart Lane and this feels a significant step for the club. It is hard to avoid the feeling that Tottenham lost direction somewhere between the departure of Harry Redknapp and Pochettino’s arrival but they seem to be building with purpose. They scored five past Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League, earlier this month, and here in in the form of an appearance in the Capital One Cup final is something tangible for supporters to latch onto. Nigel Clough was proud of his team, even if the nature of defeat had made it harder to swallow. “To come this close makes it worse in a way,” said the Sheffield United boss, who will turn his attention back to the quest for promotion against leaders Swindon on Saturday, before an FA Cup replay against Preston, next week. “We’re a club on the up,” added Clough, as he lamented Jamie Murphy’s miss, early in the game, which might have given the night a different complexion had it not been cleared by Kyle Walker on the Spurs goal line. Goalkeeper Michel Vorm spilled a high cross from the right under pressure from Stefan Scougall. Vorm thought he had been fouled, but referee Mike Dean played on and the ball dropped to Murphy, who had time but was unable to find a way past Walker. This apart, Tottenham controlled the first-half. Kane moved with menace, slamming one shot into the hands of goalkeeper Mark Howard and another into the outside of the post as he sidled past his markers. United captain Michael Doyle was deployed as the deepest midfielder but was finding it difficult to contain the fluent movement of Mousa Demebele and Eriksen when he conceded a free-kick on the Spurs right, 25 yards from goal. Sheffield United had an excellent chance to go 1-0 up early on through Jamie Murphy but it was saved on the line .

Click here to read the match report from the first leg of this tie at White Hart Lane . Up stepped Eriksen and swerved the ball with his right boot across keeper Howard and into the opposite top corner of the net. “No goalkeeper in the world would have kept that out,” said Clough. The execution was stunning - Howard did not get close – and it was a reminder of the quality chasm between the teams and the goal pierced the mood. Howard used his legs to save again from Kane and the home crowd seemed apprehensive, fearing perhaps this might turn quickly into a heavy defeat. Like their supporters, the belief of Sheffield United’s players seemed to be draining away. They went forward with a little less intent and defended nervously. Marc McNulty lashed one wide from 20 yards, but Clough needed to get them back in the dressing room, regroup and inject some of the spirit which saw them knock-out West Ham and Southampton on the way to the last four. Sheffield United were tasked with keeping Tottenham's in-form striker Harry Kane quiet at Bramall Lane . Kane battles for the ball with Ryan Flynn of Sheffield United during the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg on Wednesday night . Whatever was said, it seemed to work. Sheffield United returned with far greater threat. They managed to lift their supporters, but were kept at distance by Tottenham, who still remained dangerous as they operated more selectively, on the counter-attack. Up front, the tireless Kane fired another shot wide having been slid clear by a pass from Dembele and then muscled his way through on goal only to be thwarted by Howard, who saved again from the young striker as he took over free-kick duties from Eriksen. Ryan Mason also went close but they could not find the goal to help them relax. Clough sent on 18-year-old Adams and Michael Higdon for the last 16 minutes. The double change represented his final throw of the dice and it produced an incredible reaction. Adams quickly converted coolly at the far post from low cross from right-back Ryan Flynn, Spurs wobbled and, minutes later, he struck again. Again, it came from a cross from the right and this time the shot from Adams hit Eric Dier and deflected past Vorm. Bramall Lane erupted. The home sensed something to match Bradford’s comeback win at Chelsea, but Eriksen had other ideas, helped by Kane. Spurs are on their way to Wembley.

"Diego Costa will almost certainly miss Chelsea's title showdown with Manchester City on Saturday after being charged with violent conduct for his stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can. Costa's case is being fast-tracked by the FA and he is expected to be banned for three games following the incident in Tuesday's ill-tempered Capital One Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge. The Chelsea forward, who has escaped punishment for a separate altercation with Martin Skrtel, has until 6pm on Thursday to respond to the charge. Chelsea striker Diego Costa (right) moves towards the ball after Emre Can takes a tumble off the pitch . Costa appears to stamp on Can's right leg during a feisty Capital One Cup semi-final second leg . Jose Mourinho watches on as his striker stands on Can early in the first half at Stamford Bridge . Can was left writhing on the ground in pain but Costa was not punished my referee Michael Oliver . Costa could now face a three-game ban after being charged by the FA for his stamp on Can . The FA's disciplinary commission, which consists of a QC plus a former manager and a member of the FA council, will deliver its judgement on Friday. Even though Costa is entitled to provide a written submission and deny the charge, he has no right of appeal if he is found guilty, which is likely considering the video footage of the incident. It means Chelsea are braced for an immediate three-match ban that will include the clash with City at Stamford Bridge, along with the following Premier League games against Aston Villa and Everton. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho maintained that the fiery forward, who has scored 17 times since his move from Atletico Madrid, was innocent after their 1-0 victory over Liverpool. The FA asked referee Michael Oliver if he had seen the 12th-minute incident between Costa and Can before reviewing video footage of the clash that took place in front of Chelsea's technical area. Despite Chelsea's healthy five-point lead over Manuel Pellegrini's side, the loss of Costa will still be felt by the league leaders. On Wednesday night his Chelsea team-mate Eden Hazard defended the forward's bruising approach to the game and claimed Costa has the right attitude. Hazard said: 'When you play with this guy you have to give everything. 'You can see in every action, every ball, he gives his life. Even if he didn't score he gave his life. 'Every team and every player knows him now. He got a yellow card, but we need him because he can score in every minute, or every second. 'In training he a little bit different. He never stops and had a good mentality against Liverpool.' Costa lands on Martin Skrtel's left foot as he runs after the ball during the second period at Stamford Bridge . The FA have taken no further action against Costa for this altercation with Liverpool defender Skrtel . Sky Sports pundits Thierry Henry (left) and Jamie Redknapp both thought Costa deserved to be sent off . Cesc Fabregas, who was forced off injured against Liverpool, will be assessed on Thursday . Brendan Rodgers was openly critical of Costa's approach to the game after Chelsea advanced to their first final since Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge last summer. Although the Liverpool manager stopped short of criticising the officials, he did claim that Costa should have been sent off. The FA charge means Mourinho will have to turn to Didier Drogba or Loic Remy to play up front as Chelsea attempt to extend their lead over their nearest challengers. Chelsea are also sweating on the fitness of midfielder Cesc Fabregas after he reported for treatment at the club's training centre on Wednesday. Fabregas suffered a hamstring injury in the first half when he was challenged by Lucas Leiva and finally succumbed when he collided with captain John Terry shortly after the break. Fabregas had intensive treatment on the injury on Wednesday and Mourinho will assess the Chelsea midfielder again on Thursday. Chelsea's manager has escaped punishment from the FA after his tunnel confrontation with Oliver as the teams walked down the tunnel at half-time. Mourinho rightly believed that his team should have been awarded a penalty when Skrtel clipped Costa in the Liverpool penalty area in the first half. Radio Five Live analyst Danny Mills repeatedly called Oliver a 'bottler' on air. On Wednesday the FA, who have fined Mourinho £25,000 for claiming there is a 'campaign' against Chelsea, confirmed they will take no further action against the Portuguese coach. There was another outburst from Mourinho after the extra-time victory over Liverpool as he accused Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp of having a vendetta. Sky Sports analysts Thierry Henry and Redknapp both agreed that Costa should have been sent off for the incident with Can. Costa was also involved in an incident with Steven Gerrard as the pair wrestled during extra-time . Gerrard grabs Costa's shirt as Eden Hazard plays peacemaker by pulling the Liverpool captain away . Mourinho talks to referee Michael Oliver in the tunnel at half-time after being angered by his decisions . Mourinho said: 'I don't know what you understand by a stamp. Maybe you are already influenced by the campaign on television with certain pundits saying that Costa has committed a crime - the guy who says that must be nuts. 'Sky calls it a crime, but he goes to the ball, he chases it, the opponent goes to the floor and he puts his foot there when he is looking at the ball. 'It is a great campaign. We know how much that pundit loves Chelsea. So he is sitting there, you are very well paid and you are a manager putting their ass on the bench and these guys have a good seat, earning a lot of money, no pressure. 'They are never wrong, they have to be fair and they have to be honest.' Costa was also involved in another altercation with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, but the case is closed because Oliver booked the pair. The Chelsea striker appeared to grab Gerrard around the chest and the Liverpool captain responded by putting his head into the face of Costa. Although there were a number of other volatile incidents, the FA are only looking at one more incident. Skrtel is alleged to have made hand gestures towards Chelsea supporters at the final whistle, but the FA cannot rely on still images to charge him with misconduct. Instead they are scouring video footage in an attempt to clear up the matter as part of the FA's fast-track scheme. Oliver will escape censure from the PGMOL after his bizarre handshake with Chelsea goalscorer Branislav Ivanovic when the defender was booked for tugging Raheem Sterling's shirt.","Chelsea striker Diego Costa has been charged by the Football Association .

The former Arsenal striker, who has recently embarked on a career in punditry at Sky Sports, has made no secret of his desire to become a manager in the future.

"Mohammad Amir, the convicted spot-fixer, has been cleared for an early return to domestic cricket in Pakistan by the International Cricket Council. Amir, 22, was jailed and banned from the sport for five years for his part in a spot-fixing scandal during his country's 2010 tour of England. The prodigiously talented seam bowler, who delivered pre-arranged no-balls at Lord's as part of a plot involving Mohammad Asif and Pakistan captain Salman Butt, was not due to play again until September 2. Mohammad Amir has been cleared by the ICC to make an early return to Pakistan domestic cricket . Amir was involved in the spot-fixing scandal during Pakistan's tour of England in 2010 . But after a meeting of the ICC Board in Dubai, it has been announced that the governing body, the PCB, and anti-corruption chief Sir Ronnie Flanagan had approved his domestic availability with immediate effect. An ICC statement read: 'The ACSU chairman, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, with the prior approval of the ICC Board and the Pakistan Cricket Board, has exercised his discretion to allow Mohammad Amir to return to domestic cricket played under the auspices of the Pakistan Cricket Board with immediate effect. 'Amir's five-year ban is scheduled to expire on 2 September 2015. The ACSU chairman had exercised the powers vested in him under Article 6.8 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code after he was satisfied that Amir had cooperated with the ACSU by fully disclosing his part in the matters that led to his disqualification, admitting his guilt, showing remorse and cooperating with the unit's ongoing investigations and by recording messages for the ACSU education sessions.' In the aftermath of the spot-fixing scandal, Amir distinguished himself from his co-conspirators by admitting his guilt and showing remorse. Asif and Butt repeatedly fought charges before being found guilty at Southwark Crown Court. The latter pair were also jailed, with Asif banned from cricket for seven years (two suspended) and Butt 10 years (five suspended). TV footage showing Amir bowling a no-ball during a Test match at Lord's in 2010 . With Pakistan's first-class season already at an end and the limited-overs President's Cup finishing early next month, Amir may have to wait some time for his first competitive cricket. But the end of his ban allows him to make a full return to training and net practice, possibly overseen by the PCB, and even club cricket should the opportunity arise. It also increases his prospects of an international recall against England, of all teams. They take on Pakistan in a three-format tour of the United Arab Emirates in October, leaving Amir plenty of time to prove himself ready for selection. Quite how that would go down with the likes of Alastair Cook, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Eoin Morgan and Steven Finn - current England players who were on duty in that fateful Lord's Test - remains to be seen. There is also a question mark over Amir's status within the Pakistan dressing room. While the PCB have lobbied hard for his early return and clearly expect him to make a full comeback at the highest level, players who have performed cleanly in the shadow of his indiscretions and those of others, may be less inclined to share the field with Amir. The issue is unlikely to disappear quietly. Should Amir locate anything close to the form that made him the youngest bowler to take 50 Test wickets, he will be back centre stage soon enough and with the possibility of at least a decade of international cricket in front of him.","Mohammad Amir can make an early return to Pakistan domestic cricket .

Mario Suarez was also dismissed six minutes from the end after receiving his second yellow card. Atletico boss Diego Simeone said after the match that he told his side to ease up in the second half. 'I think we started well but we gave up on the second half and then how we played was my decision – not to take risks conceding goals and without aspirations to score any,' Simeone told reporters. The Argentine was also full of praise for Barcelona, who he feels are improving as the season progresses. 'Barcelona are much more intense in their play,' Simeone said. 'The arrival of Luis Suarez has empowered the squad, as has those of Bravo and Ter Stegen. They’re in a very good moment.

Neymar and Messi roar in celebration as Luis Enrique's side manage to score three times in the first-half . 'In the second half, we had to opt for a game that was more convenient for us against them.' The Atletico players were angry with the performance of the referee but Busquets felt that neither side benefited from his decisions. 'I've also been told that the penalty conceded by Mascherano shouldn't have been given. There were mistakes made against both teams,' he told reporters. 'There was little control in the game in the first half. It was a good half for the fans and we took advantage of the openings that we had.' Despite the fact they were chasing the game, Atletico coach Simeone said he asked his players to show more restraint at half time. Sergio Busquets (right) believes that the refereeing decisions hindered both teams during the game . Brazilian star Neymar was presented with an easy chance to fire Barcelona 3-2 ahead on the night . 'I told them not to take risks and concentrate on not conceding goals,' he told a news conference. 'I thought it was the best decision for the team and the club after the way the first half went.' Barca will face the winners of Getafe and Villarreal who play on Thursday with the latter leading 1-0 from the first leg.

"Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao met for over an hour on Tuesday night in a bid to hammer out the details of their proposed $300million (£200m) mega-fight. Mayweather visited Pacquiao in his Miami hotel suite for what was described as a 'very pleasant and very encouraging' discussion. The pair had earlier sat on opposite sides of a basketball court as Miami Heat took on the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manny and Floyd finally meet... at Miami Heat . These pictures posted on Twitter show Manny Pacquiao (left) and Floyd Mayweather meeting in Miami . The pair, pictured together for the first time, spoke and swapped phone numbers at the Heat game . Fight fans will be hoping the exchange leads to the mega-bout the world is waiting for . They talked briefly at half-time and exchanged phone numbers during what was their first ever face-to-face conversation. The fight has been in the works for almost six years but appears close to being agreed for the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2. 'That's the first time they ever sat eye to eye,' Pacquiao's adviser Michael Konz told ESPN. 'They talked at half-time, but this was a longer, more serious meeting. You could tell by their body language that this was very positive. It was for a good hour or more. A handshake brought an end to the brief encounter between Pacquiao and Mayweather in Miami . Camera crews were all over the unexpected meeting between the two boxing legends . A huge bodyguard can be seen keeping a close eye on events at the American Airlines Arena .

I think that's because they both have mutual respect for each other. We'll determine what will happen over the next couple of days.' Konz also revealed that Mayweather voiced concern over two broadcasting issues during the meeting. Pacquiao is under contract with HBO while Mayweather has two fights remaining on his six-fight deal with Showtime. It is expected a joint pay-per-view broadcast will be agreed, similar to the arrangement for Lennox Lewis' heavyweight clash with Mike Tyson in 2002. Pacquiao's was only at the basketball match after his flight to New York was delayed due to the blizzard that has hit the east coast. The Filipino was in Miami on Sunday to judge the Miss Universe pageant and has set a deadline of January 31 for Mayweather to agree terms. The closest they came to doing so was in early 2010 when Pacquiao refused to sign up to Olympic-style drug testing.

"Che Adams turned  Shefifeld United's Capital One Cup semi-final against Tottenham on its head with two goals in two minutes, but his manager Nigel Clough was left ruing the attacker celebrating his first goal. After replacing Jamal Campbell-Ryce on 74, Adams slotted clinically past Michel Vorm from a narrow angle to haul United back into the cup tie. Bramall Lane erupted and clearly swept up the 18-year-old Adams into the emotion as he ran off to celebrate rather than picking the ball out of the net with his team still chasing another goal.

But Adams (centre) made amends by scoring another goal two minutes later to bring United level . But he made amends, scoring another two minutes later on 79 to ensure a nervy ending for Tottenham, who eventually secured their passage to Wembley with a second goal from midfielder Christian Eriksen. 'I am delighted with Che Adams,' Clough said. 'We like the look of him, he is raw and has a lot of potential. But he needs to learn not to celebrate when we are chasing another goal.' Clough's cold remark will undoubtedly draw comparisons to his father, Brian. But the Blades manager spoke of his pride after the League One side were eliminated by their illustrious, Premier League opponents in the closing moments of the game, when  Eriksen reached a pass from Harry Kane and caressed the ball across Mark Howard and into the far corner of the net. 'I am incredibly proud of the players for what they have given over the two legs, to run a team like Spurs close,' Clough said to Sky Sports 1 after the full time whistle. 'That bit of quality missing tonight. The crowd and everyone at the club gave everything they had.' Clough's opposite number, Mauricio Pochettino, could not conceal his delight at booking a place at Wembley on March 1.

"The established order in women’s tennis was restored when Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams swatted away younger challengers to make the final of the Australian Open. At a time when the female game has been gloriously unpredictable in the grand slams, the world’s No 1 and 2 players will meet in Saturday’s final, the nineteenth time they have played each other. Williams saw off the breakthrough player of the event, her compatriot Madison Keys, 7-6, 6-2 but only after the teenager had saved eight match points and pushed her hard in the tiebreak, which she won 7-5. Serena Williams celebrates beating Madison Keys in straight sets to make the Australian Open final . Keys beat Venus Williams in the quarter-final but was unable to get the better of her sister Serena . Williams was pushed all the way in the first set and won it on a tiebreak - before taking the second easily . On another windy day, and in another semi-final featuring players from the same country, Sharapova had a more comfortable victory, beating No 10 seed Ekaterina Makarova 6-3, 6-2. The fact that there were eight different women’s finalists in the four grand slams last year is a mark of how open the women’s game has become. Williams has won the Australian Open on five previous occasions and is bidding for her 19th grand slam . Teenager Keys was beaten in her first grand slam semi-final . Williams and Keys shake hands after their semi final . This time it has gone to form, and if it goes to form again in the final then Williams will be the winner, as she has had a hold over the Russian, beating her sixteen times out of eighteen. In fact you need to go back 10 years for Sharapova’s last win. While Makarova seemed a bit overwhelmed by the occasion, 19 year-old Keys’ performance suggested that she will be around for a long time to come, striking her heavy groundstrokes despite having a sore upper left leg.

"Sepp Blatter has launched an astonishing attack on the British media, claiming the allegations of corruption around the Qatar World Cup bid are being driven by ‘racism and discrimination’. The FIFA president also claimed there is a plot ‘to destroy FIFA’, although his mandarins moved swiftly here to insist that remark was not targeted at the British. The 78-year-old president’s remarks came as more of FIFA’s leading sponsors joined the call for an investigation into allegations that Qatar bought the 2022 World Cup with millions of dollars-worth of bribes — administered by disgraced FIFA vice-president Mohamed bin Hammam. On the attack: Blatter hit back at his critics, particularly those in the English media . Election time: The FIFA President spoke to the South American association hoping to raise support . Blatter said: ‘Once again there is a sort of storm against FIFA relating to the Qatar World Cup. Sadly there’s a great deal of discrimination and racism and this hurts me. It really makes me sad.’ He referred to the scandal as ‘Qatargate’ before adding that FIFA need to combat ‘anything that smacks of discrimination and racism’. Blatter then spoke to the Asian congress (AFC) and essentially repeated the claim, with a more specific reference to the British press. ‘We have seen what the British press has published,’ he said. ‘I don’t know what the reasoning is behind this but we must maintain unity. ‘We are in the situation where we need leadership. I still have fire inside me and if we show unity that is the best way to deal with those in the world that want to destroy FIFA. They want to destroy us. ‘They don’t want to destroy football but they want to destroy the institution (FIFA). Because our institution is too strong and is so strong, we are sure they will not destroy it.’ Corruption claims: Blatter has come under fire over the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar . Making friends: the FIFA President promised to reward African associations with bigger bonuses . Seeking votes: Blatter is hoping to be re-elected for a fifth term as President of FIFA after the World Cup . Blatter’s agenda was obvious. As he looks to gain re-election next year, this was a surefire way to secure more support across two continents. At a meeting with the African congress he was told he could stand for 10 elections and be confident of their support. Blatter told them bonuses to African member associations from World Cup profits would be increased. ‘It’s for you, for us, for everyone,’ he said. To the Asian congress he said something similar. ‘I will give bonuses to you — actually two,’ he said. ‘The confederations also deserve it. I’m sure you will be very happy with it.’ FIFA are set to rake in £2.6billion from this World Cup and Blatter’s promise of bigger bonuses is likely to follow a pattern set in 2010. At that time Blatter pledged FIFA members would each get a £150,000 bonus from the South Africa tournament while confederations would get £1.5m. FIFA pledged a further £180,000 in January 2011 and four months later Blatter was re-elected unopposed. Blatter . also raised the issue of the two controversial reforms that will go . before the FIFA Congress this week — votes on term and age limits for . the FIFA president and executive committee members. Restating . his stance that age limits for sports administrators ‘is a form of . discrimination’, Blatter then appealed for African delegates to support . his bid for another term, having first been elected in 1998. Global support: The Asian and African federations gave Blatter a rousing ovation, but UEFA may not . Unrest: In the same city as Blatter's speeches subway workers were demonstrating, causing disruption . It is African delegates who are alleged to have received payments from Bin Hammam. Blatter received huge applause and a standing ovation following his speech on Monday. Blatter is understood to have employed a similar tack before the votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were made in Zurich. Reports by the BBC and The Sunday Times had hinted at possible corruption around the bidding process and it is believed Blatter urged executive committee members to remember the British media before casting their votes. England’s 2018 bid received just one external vote. Blatter will meet with Uefa today, but he is unlikely to receive the same warm reception from European football’s governing body. The pressure intensified on Blatter and his organisation yesterday, as yet more major sponsors called for action over the Sunday Times reports. On Sunday four of the six main FIFA sponsors — Sony, Visa, adidas and Coca-Cola — expressed their concern over the allegations. Yesterday a fifth, the Korean car giant Hyundai, released a statement. It said: ‘We are confident that Fifa is taking these allegations seriously and the investigatory chamber of the Fifa Ethics Committee will conduct a thorough investigation.’ Presence: Armed riot police were called in to deal with the strikers, who could disrupt Thursday's opener . Clashes: Train operators clashed with the police as the strike showed no sign of ending soon . World Cup sponsors Castrol and Budweiser also issued statements. With the start of the World Cup two days away, this storm raged against the backdrop of yet more civil disturbance and a metro strike. On Monday morning, Brazilian riot police used tear gas against around 300 protesters in Sao Paulo. The protest was called by metro workers who are striking in support of a wage increase. If the strike is still running on Thursday, it could severely  disrupt the opening encounter between hosts Brazil and Croatia. Traffic in much of the city has come to a standstill, with FIFA officials subjected to four-hour car journeys from the airport to their hotel on Monday.","FIFA President says Qatar criticism is driven by racism .

"Manuel Pellegrini will have to wait. His midfield talisman and his expensive new signing are staying in Equatorial Guinea a little longer. They are both yet to impress at this Africa Cup of Nations, but Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony are into the quarter-finals to face Algeria, rather than flying back to England to play Chelsea. But it was not down to a significant contribution from either man that the Ivory Coast progressed. Indeed, Toure was withdrawn 10 minutes from time, with a possibly worrying injury.

Subs not used: Barry, Roger, Kalou,  Akpa Akpro, Diomande, Traore, Sayouba . Booked: Bailly, Yaya Toure, Gbohouo . Goal: Gradel . But progress was ensure by Max Gradel, who won the game with a goal that could easily be the best we see all tournament. Having robbed Jerome Guihoata of possession on the left wing, the former Leeds winger cut inside and lashed a vicious shot at goal from 25 yards. The pace, swerve and accuracy of the shot saw it beat the otherwise excellent Joseph Ondoa, finding the corner of the net beyond the despairing goalkeeper's dive. Ivory Coast, ahead for the first time in the competition, sat back on their lead, inviting pressure from a Cameroon side who knew that defeat would see them crash out. But aside from a flurry of chances late in the first half, the previously leaky Ivorian defence held firm. And they should really have wrapped the game up on the break, Serge Aurier firing meekly at Ondoa before City's new striker fluffed a chance to seal the win. In Bony's defence he did brilliantly to hold off the scarcely legal challenge of Nicolas Nkoulou, to get his shot away, but having escaped the defender's clutches his finish was not of the standard you would expect from a £28million forward.

Liverpool defender Kolo Toure (right) attempts to block a shot from Cameroon's Edgar Salli . There were 61 fouls during Ivory Coast's win against Cameroon - the most ever recorded by Opta in an Africa Cup of Nations game. Substitute Junior Tallo almost manufactured himself a late goal as well, but it would not matter as the Elephants held on. Both sides had come into the game desperate to avoid the complicated possibility of drawing lots, with Liverpool defender Kolo Toure promising that after two disappointing performances we would see 'the real Ivory Coast' in this deciding game. And his team-mates seemed determined to prove him right, producing comfortably their most incisive football of the tournament so far, against what, on paper at least, ought to have been their toughest opponents. At the heart of everything was Gradel, the livewire winger who was only given his chance in this competition because of Gervinho's mindless red card in the first game against Guinea. Gradel came off the bench in the second match against Mali, and earned himself a place in the starting line-up with a late equaliser.

Bony is held back by Nicolas Nkoulou as he attempts to burst through on goal in Malabo . Against Cameroon he fully justified that selection, creating early chances for Bony and Yaya Toure before scoring his wonderful opener. Bony in particular should have done better with his chance in just the fifth minute, but he could only meet an awkward cross with his thigh, and Barcelona keeper Ondoa was able to react quickly and push the effort away. Toure was also denied by the 19-year-old keeper after powering a header low and on target midway through the first half, as the Ivorians created more clear-cut chances in the first 20 minutes than their first two matches. But it was after falling behind to Gradel's thunderstrike that Cameroon began to create chances of their own, the best two of which fell to Edgar Salli. Ivory Coast's players including Bony (left) and Lacina Traore celebrate after the final whistle . Stephen Mbia (left) keeps his eyes focused on the ball as Yaya Toure closes him down . The Cameroon winger beat the Ivorian offside trap just moments after his side had fallen behind only to fire straight at Guelassiognon Gbohouo, and had another great opportunity on the stroke of half-time. A brilliant run from Benjamin Moukandjo opened up the Elephants's defence, his pass released Salli, whose first touch took him beyond the defence and into the box. But, once again, having done the hard work, his shot was poor, blasting over the bar when he should really have scored. It was no surprise when Salli was hooked at the interval, but his replacement Vincent Aboubakar did little to spark a recovery. The introduction of Lyon winger Clinton Njie did at least lift the crowd, but not the standard of attacking play, and the Ivorians held out for their place in the quarter-final.","Ex-Leeds winger Max Gradel scored in the 35th minute to seal victory .

"Fernando Torres has netted three times since he completed his emotional return to Atletico Madrid earlier this month - and all within 50 seconds of the first whistle or the start of the second half. The former Chelsea striker is beginning to rediscover some of his best form - which he enjoyed during his spell at Liverpool - and, when he scored 40 seconds into the Copa del Rey quarter-final second leg with Barcelona on Wednesday, he had his third goal from just three shots on target since returning to the Vicente Calderon. The 30-year-old's first two strikes came against Real Madrid in the second leg of the previous round of the competition - both at the Bernabeu.

Torres scored just 49 seconds into the match against Real Madrid in the previous round of the Copa del Rey . He also netted just 35 seconds into the second half against Real on January 15 at the Bernabeu . Since his return to Atletico, Fernando Torres has netted three times and it seems he love scoring within the first 50 seconds of any half of football he plays. Here are the timings of his goals... 49 seconds (into first half) - vs Real Madrid (January 15) 35 seconds (into second half) - vs Real Madrid (January 15) 40 seconds (into first half) - vs Barcelona (January 28) Incredibly, just 49 seconds into the 2-2 second-leg draw with Atleti's bitter rivals, Torres slotted home past Real keeper Keylor Navas. Then, just 35 seconds into the second half, Torres was again fed through by team-mate Antoine Greizmann and he found the back of the Real net once more. A return of just one goal in four months at AC Milan had preceded his return to the club who nurtured him, yet Torres has netted three times in quick succession since arriving back at Atletico. It seems as if the loan back to a club who he knows so well - and where he is adored - has done him the world of good.

Former Chelsea forward  Torres kisses the ground having opened the scoring for his boyhood club .

But three goals in the Copa del Rey have seemingly revitalised Torres and put his career back on track. And all of them have come almost straight from kick-offs - meaning it seems that the Spaniard's sharpness is finally beginning to return.

"Manchester United have warned fans that if they do not buy a ticket for their FA Cup replay with Cambridge United they will have their season tickets suspended. The club have written to those who have not yet paid out for the televised fourth-round clash with the League Two side and told them that if they do not do so they will not be allowed entry to their Premier League home fixture against Sunderland. United operate a system in which season card holders agree to buy additional tickets for cup matches - although there are opt outs for Capital One Cup games and under 16s can opt out of FA Cup matches.

Preston/Sheffield United vs Cambridge/ Manchester United - 7.45pm (live on BBC1) Those that do not incur an automatic one-match suspension. The club say that fans are made aware of this before they buy season cards and by doing so they agree to the rules. But one fan told Sportsmail he is considering boycotting both the Cambridge and Sunderland matches. Card details given by Sam Stonier to United at the start of the season expired recently meaning they were unable to take payment for the Cambridge match. As a result the club emailed the supporter and told him that he had until the end of Wednesday to shell out - or be banned. Sam, a 30-year-old database analyst from Levenshulme, Manchester, raged: 'I find it unbelievable that the club think they can treat loyal supporters like myself that spend thousands with them like this - sending an email making threats and setting deadlines. 'This isn’t the first time this has happened and I’m sure it won’t be the last. I’m sick to death of having emails like this. 'To be honest I would be willing to miss both the Cambridge and Sunderland games as a matter of principle.' United declined to reduce prices for the match, which will take place on Tuesday following a 0-0 draw at the Abbey Stadium. Manchester United season ticket holders have been told they must by a ticket or have their card suspended . That will mean many face the prospect of forking out more than £50 to see Louis van Gaal's side take on fourth-tier opponents. A United spokesman said: 'We notify fans that failure to pay for a game in the cup scheme would mean a suspension from the next game. 'The terms and conditions are clear: “in respect of each home cup match for which the Ticket Holder fails to provide valid payment card details or for which the Ticket Holder’s card or payment is declined, the Ticket Holder’s Season Ticket may be suspended for one home league match. 'This measure was introduced at the start of the season before last. If we successfully sell the ticket the fan has failed to pay for, they can apply for a refund of the Sunderland ticket at the end of the season.'","Manchester United host Cambridge in FA Cup replay on February 3 .

"As well as having it’s name behind one of European football’s biggest clubs Manchester City, Abu Dhabi now looks set to have its name in front of one of the world’s most emblematic stadiums – the Santiago Bernabeu. The Arab Emirate that has bankrolled Manchester City entered into a financial partnership with Real Madrid last November and for around £15million a year over a reported 20-year period they have won the naming rights for the club’s stadium according to Diario AS. Coca-Cola and Microsoft had both shown an interest in having their name on the Bernabeu but the race looks to have been won by the Spanish energy company Cepsa which in turn is owned by the IPIC (International Petroleum Investment Company) which is owned by the Abu Dhabi government. Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu stadium is set to be renamed Abu Dhabi Bernabeu . The Bernabeu was opened in 1947 and is one of the most iconic venues in world football . Name: Santiago Bernabeu . Capacity: 81,044 . Built: 1944-47 . Opened: 1947 . First match: Real Madrid 3-1 OS Belenenses . The stadium was named after former Real chairman Santiago Bernabeu Yeste. Madrid-based Cepsa is Spain's fourth largest industrial group in terms of turnover, while IPIC, formed in 1984, has invested in 18 leading companies within the energy and related sectors across the globe. In November of last year when the three-year tie-up between IPIC and Real announced by Madrid, president Florentino Perez was caught on camera saying the stadium will be called ‘IPIC or Cespa, whatever they want’. According to the AS report the sponsors have settled for ‘Abu Dhabi Bernabeu’. The stadium was named after former Real chairman Santiago Bernabeu Yeste . The renaming will not take place until the stadium is remodelled. Planning permission for the £375m project is currently stalled because of a European Commission enquiry into possible illegal state aid. Real Madrid are currently finalising financing for the redevelopement and the somewhat unpopular sale of the stadium’s name is seen as one way to raise funds towards that end. It was revealed last week that Real are the world's richest club in terms of revenue, raking in a staggering £459.5m in 2013-14 and the renaming of the stadium to earn extra cash is certain to anger supporters of this traditional club. The stadium has a capacity of 81,044 and is the second largest home ground of a top-flight club in Europe . The iconic venue was opened in 1947 and named after the club's former chairman Santiago Bernabeu Yeste and has hosted four European Cup finals and the 1982 World Cup final. The £300m Abu Dhabi investment will be the club's most lucrative deal in its history and, as well as helping fund the redevelopment of the famous old ground, will give Real the best chance of staying ahead of La Liga rivals Barcelona. It was revealed this week that the Catalan giants are reviewing their £123.4m with Qatar Sports Investments which expires next year and is almost certain to increase.","Real Madrid agreed to sell naming rights to Abu Dhabi for £15m a year .

"Gareth Raynor, 40, (pictured outside Hull Crown Court today) is accused of pinning down and raping a woman following a New Year's Eve party in 2006 . A former Great Britain rugby league star pinned a woman to a bed and raped her after a New Year's Eve party when he was at the height of his career, a court heard today. Gareth Raynor, 40, of Pontefract, West Yorkshire, is accused of raping the woman and putting his arms across her throat following a New Year's Eve party in East Yorkshire in 2006. A jury at Hull Crown Court heard today how Raynor is also accused of an attack on another woman in Featherstone, in which he allegedly slashed her thigh with a bread knife. The former Leeds Rhinos and Hull FC winger has pleaded not guilty to both the charge of rape and unlawful wounding. Opening the prosecution case today, Crown barrister Matthew Bean said Raynor was a well-known rugby player who had played for Bradford Bulls, Leeds Rhinos, Featherstone Rovers, Leicester Tigers and represented Great Britain from 2005 to 2008. He said that although Raynor was described as a shy man, he could be controlling, aggressive and violent towards women. He told the court about the two offences of which Raynor is accused. Speaking about the alleged rape, Mr Bean said the alleged victim remembered being pinned down with her arms above her head and Raynor using his other arm to pin her by the throat. He told the court: 'She said he put his arm over her throat, so she could not speak. 'She was trying to say no, but was not able to say anything. She was crying and attempting to say no. 'In an effort to get him off, she bit his chest. He did not speak throughout the whole incident.' Mr Bean also told the court about the alleged assault on a woman in Featherstone, which occurred in April 2007. He said: 'During the course of an argument he [Raynor] picked up a bread knife from the kitchen and returned with it. 'She said she was screaming at him to put the knife away.' He told the court how others in the property were alerted to the scene but the victim warned them away only to be attacked when they left. Mr Bean added: 'He used the knife to slash the top of her thigh. She remembers the pain. She said she yelped like a dog. 'She simply curled up in a ball.' Mr Bean said the woman did not report the charge of wounding at the time and, when questioned about it, Raynor said they had been playing a game of 'dare'. Former Leeds Rhinos and Hull FC winger Raynor, of Pontefract, West Yorkshire, (pictured outside Hull Crown Court with a female friend) has pleaded not guilty to both the charge of rape and that of unlawful wounding . Hull Crown Court (pictured) heard how Raynor was described as a shy man but could be controlling and violent towards women. He is accused of raping a woman in Yorkshire and attacking another in Featherstone . The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, did not initially seek medical attention but was advised to go to hospital after telling her boss about the incident at work the following day. Mr Bean told the court how neither incident was reported to police until September 2013. He said that during police interview, Raynor denied the rape allegation and claimed it was a lie. Raynor became a GB International after first playing for Leeds Rhinos and then Hull FC. The court heard he played 158 times over an eight-year period for rugby league outfit Hull FC. He was released by Hull and joined the new-look Welsh Crusaders Rugby League club on Boxing Day 2009. In September the following year, he signed a one-year deal with Bradford Bulls and in July 2013 he signed a year-long contract with London Skolars. He became a star for GB team winning six caps and scored the match winning try in the 2006 Tri Nations win over Australia. The trial continues.

"Cristiano Ronaldo has been handed a two-match ban for his outburst during Saturday’s 2-1 win over Cordoba. Much to the dissatisfaction of Real Madrid’s title rivals the player will now miss only Real’s home game with David Moyes’ Real Sociedad on Saturday and the home match with Sevilla three days later. He will be available for one of the season’s title deciders away to Atletico Madrid the following weekend. Pressure had been put on the Spanish FA to make an example of Ronaldo after he slapped Cordoba defender Jose Angel Crespo at a corner, then kicked Edimar, and landed another blow on Crespo. Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off after kicking out at Cordoba defender Edimar Fraga (left) The Real Madrid had previously escaped punishment for throwing a punch at  Jose Angel Crespo . Ronaldo appears to claim there is nothing wrong as the Brazilian defender goes down clutching his face . In a final act of petulance, Ronaldo takes a backhand swipe at Crespo before being shown the red card . But match referee Alejandro Hernandez never saw the first incident and only reported the kick on Edimar in his match report and not the subsequent striking of Crespo. Hernandez’ match report stated: ‘In minute 83 the player Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off for the following reason: Kicking his rival off the ball’. The Spanish FA’s disciplinary committee could have asked Hernandez to elaborate on his report but instead have given Ronaldo the minimum punishment for the digression outlined by the referee. It was Ronaldo’s ninth career red card and he now has eight more than Leo Messi who has never been sent off for Barcelona but was red-carded on his debut for Argentina. The Portuguese international still has some way to catch Zinedine Zidane. The Real Madrid legend currently coaching the club’s B-team was sent off 14 times in his career. Ronaldo can only offer a nonchalant shrug as referee Hernandez Hernandez shows him the red card . Ronaldo heads into the dressing room before Gareth Bale scored to earn Real Madrid a 2-1 victory . Ronaldo will miss the chance of facing former Manchester United manager David Moyes' Real Sociedad . Ronaldo apologised for the sending off on social media after for forgiveness for his moment of rashness, saying: 'I apologise to everyone and especially Edimar for my thoughtless act in the game today'. He is also understood to have said sorry to team-mates in Monday’s training session. Ronaldo’s red mist comes at a difficult time for Real Madrid. They lost the opening league game of the year against Valencia, were knocked out of the cup by Atletico Madrid, have a potential Fifa transfer ban hanging over them, and an improving Barcelona close on their heels. On Saturday they will have to cope without their talisman as Real Sociedad come to the Bernabeu having already beaten Madrid once this season.","Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off for lashing out at Cordoba defender .

"Barcelona's visit to Atletico Madrid was always going to be a feisty affair, but not many fans inside the Vicente Calderon would've expected to see a player launch his footwear at an official. That's exactly what happened in the second half when, after having his boot removed in a tackle, Atleti midfielder Arda Turan decided to pick it up and chuck it at one of the game's two linesmen. The Turkish international missed his target but, despite his intent being clear to everyone inside the stadium, referee Jesus Gil only showed him a yellow card. VIDEO Scroll down for Arda Turan throws his boot at linesman during Atletico 2-2 Barcelona . Atletico Madrid midfielder Arda Turan bends down to pick up his boot after it came off during a challenge . The Turkish international decides to launch his boot in the direction of one of the game's linesman . Turan's boot can be seen flying over the head of the linesman and towards a ballboy . Turan's frustration stemmed from a challenge by Dani Alves which left him wearing only one boot and the sending off of his midfield partner Gabi, who failed to reemerge for the second period after insulting referee Gil in the tunnel at half-time. The former Galatasaray man was fortunate to avoid a second yellow shortly after his moment of madness when the ball struck his arm and Gil gave Barca a free-kick. Atletico boss Diego Simeone then quickly withdrew him from the action, perhaps sensing that his side would be down to nine men if Turan was allowed to remain on the pitch. The incident occurred during a frantic Copa del Rey quarter final second leg which began with Fernando Torres making it 1-1 on aggregate with a goal inside the first minute.

Luis Enrique's men then battled back superbly, with a Miranda own goal and another strike from Neymar before half-time giving them a comfortable 4-2 lead on aggregate. There was more controversy late in the second half when Atleti midfielder Mario Suarez was dismissed after picking up two yellow cards, the second of which was for raking his studs down Lionel Messi's achilles. That did leave Simeone's side down to nine men and they were unable to get themselves back into the game as Barcelona progressed to the semi-finals.

"Five cannon that were once used by Blackbeard to terrorize the Atlantic shipping lanes have been recovered from a wreck that belonged to the notorious pirate. The cannon, one weighing 3,000lb, are the latest artifacts divers have salvaged from the wreck of the Queen Anne's Revenge, which ran aground off North Carolina in 1718. Since the wreck was found on a sandbar in Beaufort Inlet in 1996, a team of archeologists have scavenged the ship for treasures including gold dust, coins, glass beads and a pewter syringe. Salvaged: One of the five cannon is raised from the wreck of the Queen's Anne Revenge . 'Today is definitely a red-letter day: five guns coming off the site,' David Moore, who has been part of the recovery team from 1996, told CBS News. The weapons, brought to the surface on Monday, would have fired 6lb cannon balls at any ships daring to confront them. 'This is spectatular. This is the most cannon we have ever raised in a single day,' Faye Mitchell, of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, said. 'We also raised two concretions which are these barrel hoops they used to store food provisions and things like that,' she told WPTV. Historians believe the largest cannon found was made in Sweden, meaning Blackbeard who was also known as Edward Teach or Thatch, had guns from different countries on board. Feared: The Queen Anne's Revenge, a former slave vessel, was the head of Blackbeard's fearsome flotilla . In total, 40 cannon were believed to have been on board the Queen Anne's Revenge, a former French slaveship taken by Blackbeard and his men off Martinique in 1717. Since the wreck was discovered in 1996, 22 of the ship's guns and about 280,000 artifacts have been recovered. The location and size of the ship, as well as the finds, has led experts to conclude that the ship really is the Queen's Anne Revenge. 'It's in the right place, from the right time. The artifacts are all dating to the appropriate period. She was the right size ship. It's nothing else it can be,' David Moore, from Beaufort's maritime museum said. Once the cannon and other artifacts have been recovered, they are sent to a laboratory in Greenville to be cleaned and analyzed. Raised: An 11ft anchor, weighing nearly 3,000lb, was recovered from the wreck in 2011 . Infamous: Ian McShane played legendary pirate Blackbeard in the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film . 'For every month we spend here on the . site, you spend 11 or 12 months in the lab getting these artifacts . cleaned and interpreted and analyzed,' Mr Moore said. The five cannon will be the last of the treasure to surface this year, as the dive ends for the year. 'We're going to continue excavating the site and have it completed by 2014,' project director Billy Ray Morris said. An exhibition of the finds, including an 11ft anchor weighing nearly 3,000lb that was found in 2011, is on display at Beaufort's North Carolina Maritime Museum. Rare find: A pewter syringe discovered in 2007 is among other centuries-old items found in the wreckage . Other finds have included onion bottles, bells, buckles and a partly gilded hilt thought to have held Blackbeard's sword. After running aground off North Carolina in 1718, the pirate escaped to another ship in his flotilla and continued his life of piracy for another six months until forces hired by Virginia's governor killed him. To prove the pirate was dead Royal Navy Lieutenant Robert Maynard, who led the fatal attack, returned to Virginia with Blackbeard's severed head hanging from his ship's bow.","Weapons that would have fired 6lb cannon balls brought to surface .

"Johnny Kock, 68, tried to import £1b of cocaine hidden in boxes of washing powder . A drugs kingpin who tried to import an estimated£1billion of cocaine hidden in boxes of washing powder has been jailed for 25 years. Johnny Kock, 68, posed as a respectable businessman in his huge European operation to 'flood the streets' with cocaine. Kock, from Wavertree, Merseyside, used a pond liner company as cover to ship in vast amounts of cocaine in boxes of washing powder. Millions of pounds of drugs were found in a single consignment but a further 57 shippings had already taken place, leading experts to believe he was responsible for £1bn worth of drugs being brought into Britain. Sentencing him to 25 years behind bars at Liverpool Crown Court yesterday, Judge Mark Brown said: 'In terms of the amounts of cocaine, this must be one of the biggest ever offences considered by the courts.' Grey-haired Kock was arrested last October when police discovered cocaine worth £26m and 110,000 Euros in two separate seizures in the German city of Bremen and the Channel Tunnel town of Coquelles, in northern France. At the time of the bust, 125kg of cocaine was said to be destined for a warehouse within the Knowsley Industrial Park complex, in Kirkby, Liverpool. Police also found £4,570 in his van and £7,170 at the home he shared with partner Deborah Fagan in Wavertree – said to be money obtained through his drug importing business. The court was told that the seized shipments were just two out of 57 shipments known to have been delivered to Kock's business Aquaries Pondliner Ltd, based in the Old Swan area of Liverpool. Judge Brown said the amount of cocaine brought in by Koch was between one and six tonnes. The National Crime Agency said that if 6,000 kilos of cocaine was imported, it would be potentially worth £960m on the streets. Kock used a pond liner company as cover to ship in vast amounts of cocaine in boxes of washing powder . Kock pleaded guilty to conspiracy to evade the prohibition on the importation of class A drugs, concealing criminal property and two counts of possession of criminal property. He later tried to change his plea on the drug case to not guilty, claiming he thought he was moving cannabis and never opened the packages. That bid failed following a two-day court hearing this week. Kock was arrested last October when police discovered cocaine worth £20m and 110,000 Euros in two separate seizures in the German city of Bremen and the Channel Tunnel town of Coquelles, in northern France . Alex Leach, prosecuting, said the value of the recovered drugs alone was an estimated £26m, never mind the other shipments that got through. He told the court: 'The prosecution case is that each of the 57 loads contained somewhere between 23 and 107 kilos of cocaine. 'It's at the very highest level of drug importation into this country. The scope of this conspiracy stretches far beyond the two loads that were recovered.' Judge Brown went further, saying: 'This really is the top end of the scale is it not? When you are in the order of six tonnes, and high purity at that? 'It was in my opinion a relatively simple but audacious way of getting class A drugs into the UK. 'Whilst it isn't possible for the prosecution to determine precisely the weight of cocaine you imported it was obviously a vast amount, at least between 1,300kg and 6,000kg, worth many, many millions of pounds. 'Also this was high purity cocaine that no doubt would have been cut up for street dealing. 'This case highlights the ease with which vast amounts of cocaine can be imported into this country. 'You must have known you were playing for high stakes both in financial reward and the consequences if discovered. 'I'm satisfied that was a risk you were willing to take therefore it follows there must be a very substantial term of imprisonment.' Judge Brown also congratulated the officers who brought Kock to justice, saying they had closed down a significant avenue to drugs, which he called a 'cancer on society', to enter the UK. Kock's partner Fagan, was jailed for 12 months in April after admitting charges related to the drugs money.","Johnny Kock, 68, tried to import £1bn of cocaine in washing powder boxes .

"Sick online traders are promoting and selling memorabilia connected to convicted rapist footballer Ched Evans on eBay. Signed shirts, match programmes and football cards are being touted to the highest bidder by sellers attempting to capitalise on Evans's notoriety. Cynical traders are even using name to act as the unique selling point for goods which are not specific to him - a Sheffield United shirt signed by several players uses his name alone in the advert. Sick opportunism: The Ched Evans Sheffield United away shirt recently sold for £60 on eBay, while a Norwich City card signed by the player has an asking price of £4.99 . Evans, 26, served half of a five year sentence for the rape of a 19-year-old girl in Rhyl, North Wales, in 2011. Since being released from prison, he has attempted to win a contract from a number of professional clubs without success. Oldham Athletic pulled out of signing him this month after a public outcry and the club's board members receiving death threats. And with the footballer's career still in doubt, sick traders are taking advantage of the situation on eBay. Evans, 26, served half of a five year sentence for the rape of a 19-year-old girl in Rhyl, North Wales, in 2011 . Sick: In perhaps the most cynical of selling tactics, one trader has used his name alone to advertise a Sheffield United shirt signed by a number of different players. The items for sale include a programme from the player's last match between Sheffield United and Leyton Orient, dated April 14 2012 - selling for £2.99. A Sheffield United jersey with Ched Evans's name printed on the back sold for £60 just four days ago.

In contrast, another trader is offering 'No To Ched Evans' t-shirts for £13.99, which feature a circled 'Ched' with a red line through the name. An appeal against Evans's conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. After his release, Evans released a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name.

Meanwhile, the website set up to defend convicted rapist Ched Evans has been referred to the police over a complaint by his victim's father that the footballer's supporters have identified her. The Attorney General Jeremy Wright QC has also asked North Wales Police to look into whether evidence served during Evans' trial in 2012 has been dealt with 'properly'. In Britain all sex attack victims are granted anonymity and it is a criminal offence to name them. But the woman raped by Evans has been forced to change her name and move for a fifth time after being hunted down by vile internet trolls. New twist: A website set up to support Ched Evans, pictured with his fiancée Natasha Massey, will be investigated by police and prosecutors after a complaint it helps identify his victim .","Signed shirts and match programmes are being offered to highest bidder .

"Two cannons used by notorious pirate Blackbeard to wreak terror over the seas centuries ago have been raised from the wreck of his ship. Deep sea divers have recovered two guns from the remains of the Queen Anne's Revenge where it rests at the bottom of the ocean off the coast of North Carolina. A former French slave ship, it was re-named the Queen Anne's Revenge by English-born Blackbeard after he captured it in 1717. Historic treasures: Divers emerged from the waves with the two cannon off the coast of Carteret County in North Carolina . It was hoped the dive expedition last week would yield eight cannon, but the project was hampered by bad weather until Thursday . It was hoped the dive expedition last week would yield eight cannons. Experts have found an array of fascinating artefacts from Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge wreckage since 1996. Archeologists have recovered onion bottles, two bells of Spanish or Portuguese origin a coin weight with Queen Anne's likeness stamped on it, buckles, glass beads, buttons, cuff links, pieces of wine glasses, a syringe, gold flakes, among others. The same team are said to have also found 11 cannons from the pirate ship, including one in 2005 and another in 2007. Another rare find was a partly gilded hilt thought to have held the sword of Blackbeard himself. But the project was hampered by bad weather until Thursday, according to a Fox News report. The dive was carried out as part of $450,000 scheme to remove all of the artefacts from the historic ship by the end of next year. The Queen Anne's Revenge was the . infamous vessel commanded by English outlaw Blackbeard - who roamed the . seas in the early 18th century and wore lit fuses under his hat to . frighten his enemies. Named after his flowing black beard, . Blackbeard - whose real name is thought to be Edward Teach or Thatch - . operated around the West Indies and the east coast of the American . colonies. In 1717, he captured a French slave ship and renamed it Queen Anne's Revenge. Although . Blackbeard's career lasted only two years, he was the world's most . feared pirate and once held hostage the entire city of Charleston, South . Carolina. Raised from the deep: Two cannon have been lifted from the wreck of the ship Blackbeard used to wreak terror on the seas in the 18th century . Heave ho: Straps were attached to the cannon - believed to have been used on Blackbeard's captured ship in the 18th century - and they were winched on the waiting boat . In 2011, crews also salvaged an anchor from the wreckage. The anchor is 11 feet, 4 inches long with arms that are 7 feet, 7 inches . across. It was covered with concretion — a mixture of shells, sand and . other debris attracted by the leaching wrought iron — and a few sea . squirts. Its weight was estimated at 2,500 to 3,000 pounds. Named after his flowing black beard, Blackbeard - whose real name is thought to be Edward Teach or Thatch - operated around the West Indies and the east coast of the American colonies . Raised: A 3,000 pound anchor from what is believed to be the wreck of the pirate Blackbeard's flagship, the Queen Anne's Revenge has been recovered . Raised: An 11ft anchor, weighing nearly 3,000lb, was recovered from the wreck in 2011 . Legendary vessel: Blackbeard's ship the Queen Anne's Revenge has been heavily excavated over the past 14 years . Site: The Queen Anne's Revenge ran aground near Beaufort, North Carolina in 1718 but stayed intact for a year before eventually disintegrating and collapsing . Feared: The Queen Anne's Revenge, a former slave vessel, was the head of Blackbeard's fearsome flotilla . Archaeologists had planned to remove the second-largest anchor, which is . 13 feet long with arms that are 8 feet across, from the top of the . ballast pile. But it was too well-attached, so instead the divers went . in from the side to retrieve the everyday anchor. Blackbeard settled in Bath, North Carolina, where he eventually received a governor's pardon.Some experts say he grew bored and returned to piracy. He . was killed by volunteers from the British Royal Navy in November 1718, . five months after the ship thought to be Queen Anne's Revenge sank. After . running aground on a sandbar in 1718 near the town of Beaufort, North . Carolina, the ship was abandoned but probably remained intact for as . long as a year before collapsing and disintegrating. Recovery: Experts raised a six foot-long cannon from wreckage of the Queen Anne's Revenge in 2005 . Rare find: A pewter syringe discovered in 2007 is among other centuries-old items found in the wreckage . Team effort: Another cannon was raised from the seabed wreckage in October 2007 near Morehead City, North Carolina . Linda Carlisle, North Carolina's cultural resources secretary, said at the time the anchor was salvaged: 'Blackbeard and piracy are important threads in eastern North Carolina's maritime heritage fabric. 'The historic and economic value of this project is enormous.' The Queen Anne's Revenge shipwreck site, located off North Carolina's coast, has yielded more than 250,000 artifacts and is listed on the National Register of Historic Sites.

"Labour is yet to come up with a way to pay for its plans to cut tuition fees by £3,000 a year, it emerged last night. Ed Miliband is expected to launch the policy during the election campaign in an effort to woo former Lib Dem voters and students. But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has not yet worked out how to fund the reduction of a third, which is expected to cost £2.5billion a year. Scroll down for video . Tell me you found the money... Ed Miliband is expected to pledge a tuition fee cut, but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has not yet worked out how to fund the reduction of a third - expected to cost £2.5billion a year . At the start of January, Mr Miliband gave a strong hint that he would pledge to cut fees from their current level of £9,000 to £6,000. Previously, Labour said if it were currently in power, it would pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks and higher rates of interest for better-off students. But this is yet to be firmed up as a manifesto commitment. A student challenged Mr Miliband on the subject of fees in Manchester three weeks ago. The Labour leader answered that he would be making an offer but told voters to ‘watch this space’ for the details. He promised the plan would be ‘credible and costed’ to avoid a repeat of Nick Clegg’s disastrous U-turn on the matter, after the Coalition raised fees to a maximum of £9,000 from 2012. U-turn: Mr Clegg’s failure to stick to his 2010 election vow not to increase fees is widely seen as the beginning of the end of his political career . Mr Clegg’s failure to stick to his 2010 election promise not to increase fees is widely seen as a crucial reason for huge disaffection among Lib Dem voters. The BBC’s economics editor Robert Peston reported on his blog last night that Mr Miliband wants to announce the fees cut next month. But he added that Mr Balls has been ‘asked to make the sums add up’. A Tory source said the commitment to lower the cost of university tuition would ‘lead to higher taxes or borrowing’. The source also pointed out Mr Miliband would, by cutting fees, be reversing a pledge made during his Labour leadership campaign to introduce a graduate tax. This would involve graduates paying more tax over a lifetime as a result of having a degree. However last week, the party’s universities spokesman Liam Byrne indicated that Labour could still move to a graduate tax in the long term. Cutting fees would be popular among students at a time when Labour is facing fierce competition for their votes from the Green Party, which wants to scrap fees altogether. A Labour spokesman said: ‘In trebling tuition fees this Government has found a system of university finance that puts a huge burden of debt on students, while almost costing the taxpayer more than it saves. It lets down both the next generation and the public finances.’ Labour introduced tuition fees in September 1998, with students expected to pay up to £1,000 a year. The fees were then increased to £3,000 a year during Labour’s second term in January 2004.","Miliband expected to launch the policy during the election campaign .

"A dog in Illinois is being hailed a hero after coming to the rescue of a canine companion that fell the ice of a lake into the freezing waters below. The desperate situation occurred in Andalusia as Water and Sewage Treatment were breaking for lunch. Suddenly a dog came up to the group of men barking, running in circles and trying to get their attention. That's when they realized a second dog had fallen into the nearby lake. Hero: This dog was able to get the attention of Water and Sewerage Treatment plant workers and show them that another dog, Buck, had fallen through the ice of a nearby lake . Rescue: The men quickly got a boat and were able to pull the drowning dog out of the water . Safety: After the rescue, the hero dog ran away into the sunset, the men said . 'The dog had been there a long time,' Matt Stark, a worker at the treatment plant, told ABC News. You could tell when we first got there it was howling like giving its last goodbyes or it was in pain, because we think it had been in the water about an hour. 'I told the guys we gotta hurry because the dog wasn’t holding its head up no more.' The men called the emergency number, but quickly got to work trying to save the near-drowning dog, which has since been identified as Buck. They pushed a boat up to the end of the ice and used a snare to drag the 10-year-old black Labrador out of the water. 'He just was shivering as can be,' Stark said. Saved: Buck is seen here shivering and cold after the incident. He was checked out by a vet . Snug: The men did what they can to warm Buck up after being in the freezing water 'for a while' 'I thought, ''Good for you, buddy, you’ll get another day to hunt''.' Buck was taken to the Rock Island County Animal Care & Control where a veterinarian checked him out. His owner has since come forward and said he was out hunting with a friend when their dogs became separated.

"During the Leveson Inquiry, a stream of celebrities poured into the Royal Courts of Justice to talk about the iniquities of the Press. Star after star called for tighter regulation on newspapers, telling Lord Justice Leveson how the tabloids had hounded them, made their lives miserable and used every ‘dark art’ imaginable. But the phone hacking trial has lifted the veil on the other side of the relationship between celebrities and the tabloid Press – and it’s a side Lord Justice Leveson’s cast of famous faces was less eager to discuss. Scroll down for video . Close friends: Jude Law, far left, with Sienna Miller and Daniel Craig. The jury heard evidence about the alleged affair between Miller and Craig . Self-confessed phone hacker Dan Evans claimed he had uncovered the relationship when he hacked the 007 actor's voicemails . With combative lawyers prepared to scrutinise the evidence of witnesses, the trial revealed the underbelly of celebrity: how friends, family and even the famous themselves willingly sold stories to the News of the World for money, influence or to extend their own time in the spotlight. There were revelations about George Best’s son Calum, socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson and Eimear Cook, ex-wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie. It emerged that former Home Secretary David Blunkett complained to a friend that ‘hyenas’ had betrayed him – little suspecting his friend was the one who had tipped off newspapers and would ultimately sell his voicemails to the highest bidder. And perhaps most dramatically of all, Hollywood star Jude Law was confronted in court with information that a close member of his own family had sold secrets about him. Visibly shaken, the actor said the unnamed male relative had admitted giving information to the newspaper but said he had not known the man had taken the tabloid’s money. The jury heard claims the actor had effectively approved a front page story revealing his former fiancée Sienna Miller’s affair with James Bond star Daniel Craig. Law denied he had sanctioned the 2005 article, but the court heard his publicist had asked the tabloid to ‘back-date’ Miss Miller’s affair with Craig so it would appear she cheated on Law before he was caught out in a fling with his children’s nanny. In a taped conversation with a journalist, Law’s publicist appeared to be speaking on his behalf when she said: ‘If you could definitely pre-date it so that she cheated first, that’s the thing he wants the most.’ Coulson, then editor of the News of . the World, was so confident the article had been signed off by Law that . he told sub-editors to avoid calling him a ‘love rat’ and emailed a . colleague saying: ‘This story is effectively from Jude.’ The affair between Miss Miller and . Craig was a key part of the prosecution case. Self-confessed phone . hacker Dan Evans claimed he had uncovered the relationship when he . hacked the 007 actor’s voicemails. But . Miss Miller’s own driver had apparently sold the story to the tabloid . for £6,000 after catching the actress at a secret rendezvous with Craig. There . is no dispute that phone hacking happened at the tabloid. Miss Miller, . for example, received £100,000 damages from Rupert Murdoch’s News Group . Newspapers. But lawyers at the trial set out to . show that journalists and newspapers relied on countless legitimate . sources to gather information. The judge told lawyers he was anxious the trial should not unravel into a ‘celebrity chat show’ dominated by star witnesses. Unlike the Leveson Inquiry – which faced . criticism that it gave celebrities a platform to make any complaint . about the Press they chose, seemingly without challenge – trial . witnesses had their evidence scrutinised to the standards of a criminal . trial. Former Head of News International Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie Brooks sit in a taxi as they leave the Old Bailey after being cleared yesterday . Brooks' deputy and later editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson was swept from court after being found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones . Among the startling revelations: . CALUM BEST . The son of footballer George Best admitted he had ‘actively encouraged’ some media intrusion into his personal life. The 33-year-old pocketed £2,000 from the News of the World for the story of his own sordid nightclub tryst with Mick Jagger’s daughter Elizabeth. Calum Best pocketed £2,000 from the . News of the World for the story of his own nightclub tryst with . Mick Jagger’s daughter Elizabeth . He also passed on stories about his friends. Mr Justice Saunders said: ‘Calum Best is a full-time “celebrity”. He needs publicity in order to remain a full-time “celebrity”. He sometimes supplies information to the Press himself.’ TARA PALMER-TOMKINSON . Prince Charles’ goddaughter was revealed as one of the News of the World’s sources for information about the Royal Family. Tara-Palmer Tomkinson was revealed as one of the News of the World's sources for information about the Royal Family . Former royal editor Clive Goodman ‘outed’ her as the source for its story about Prince William’s 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle being gatecrashed by ‘comedy terrorist’ Aaron Barschak in 2003. Then Andy Coulson confirmed the newspaper had paid a ‘female’ source for this story – and other royal scoops – although he did not name Miss Palmer-Tomkinson. SIENNA MILLER . Miss Miller - hailed as a 'hacking heroine' when she took civil action against the News of the World and gave evidence to Leveson - used her time as a witness to complain once again about media coverage . Miss Miller – hailed as a ‘hacking heroine’ when she took civil action against the News of the World and gave evidence to Leveson – used her time as a witness to complain once again about media coverage of the evidence surrounding her ‘very brief encounter’ with Daniel Craig. ‘This is a really difficult and uncomfortable part of my life to discuss, seeing as it’s been allowed out of the courtroom and into the hands of the world’s media to be gossiped [over] and analysed, and me vilified for it,’ she said. It’s been turned into this titillating piece of information. I really regret that it has been allowed to be analysed in the way that it has.’ Trial judge Mr Justice Saunders said he was sorry if coverage had upset Miss Miller but assured her the evidence had been necessary. He did not say – but some in the courtroom could be forgiven for thinking – that the actress’ hurt feelings were not his priority in a complex trial in which seven people’s reputations and liberty hung in the balance. EIMEAR COOK . Eimear Cook, ex wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie, also gave evidence to the court . The ex-wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie denied claims she had told Brooks about a ‘violent event’ during her 14-year marriage in the hope Brooks would expose her ex-husband in the Sun. Mrs Cook, who accepted a payout from the News of the World for phone hacking, denied she had invented her evidence to boost her  civil claim for aggravated damages. She was accused of telling a ‘bare-face lie’ in her evidence, when she claimed Brooks had told her it was ‘easy’ to hack phones. Mrs Cook, 43, said Brooks told her about phone hacking at a meeting in 2005 in which the then Sun editor had also laughed about her own arrest for an alleged assault on her then husband, EastEnders actor Ross Kemp. Mrs Cook was accused of lying when it emerged that Brooks’ arrest did not take place until several weeks after the meeting.","After Leveson the phone hacking trial has lifted the veil on the 'other side' of the relationship between celebrities and the tabloid Press .

"ADEBAYOR LEFT OUT IN THE COLD . Emmanuel Adebayor could only make the Tottenham bench on Wednesday night but it’s understood that the Togo striker is one of a number of players whose name has cropped up in discussions between Spurs and Paris Saint-Germain. Adebayor captained his team in last week’s first leg but was jeered by a section of supporters when he was replaced by Roberto Soldado in the second half. The 30-year-old former Arsenal and Manchester City striker has been kept out of the first-team this season by the emergence of Harry Kane and Spurs might be prepared to consider letting him join PSG on loan for the rest of the season. The Qatar-backed French champions could certainly afford his £140,000-a-week wages. Out of favour Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor was benched for the encounter with Sheffield United . DE GIROLAMO REFUSING NEW DEAL . Sheffield may have to consider selling Diego de Girolamo before the transfer window closes if the teenage striker does not agree to sign a new contract at Bramall Lane. De Girolamo, 19, scored his first goal for the club in the FA Cup draw with Preston at the weekend but is refusing to sign a new deal. His current contract runs out in the summer, when United will only receive £200,000 in compensation, and there has been interest from Juventus and several Premier League clubs. Manager Nigel Clough tried to play down the issue in his programme notes, saying: ‘We are relaxed about his contract situation and remain optimistic he will make the right decision and stay with us.’ Teenage Sheffield United striker Diego de Girolamo (No 23) has refused to sign a new contract with the Blades . WHY ALWAYS SABELLA? Wednesday's match programme included a fascinating article on Alex Sabella, a one-time Sheffield United player and now better known as the former head coach of Argentina who led his country to the World Cup final in Brazil last summer. Among the documents printed with the article were Sabella’s transfer agreement from River Plate in 1978, his national insurance card, a fixed penalty from South Yorkshire police for failing to display a tax disc, and a bill from the club of £2,285.77 for household goods including a cooker, carpets and fridge.

"A leading Chelsea fanzine has attempted to stop civil war breaking out among Blues fans over the return of Frank Lampard to Stamford Bridge on Saturday by urging supporters to give a 'good, appreciative reception' for a player they consider the greatest in the club's recent history. Chelsea fans are split over how to receive Lampard who will be part of Manchester City's squad this weekend in a clash of the Premier League's top two. Lampard scored a record 211 goals for Chelsea in 648 games between 2001 and 2014 and is viewed as a genuine club legend by supporters. But many of them are unhappy the 36-year-old is playing for their biggest title rival, particularly as the impression was given he'd go straight to America's MLS as Steven Gerrard will do when he leaves Liverpool. Frank Lampard (pictured left with former team-mate John Terry) is Chelsea's top scorer of all time . He left the club to join New York City, via a season-long spell at Chelsea's Premier League rivals Man City . Now the influential Chelsea fans' magazine cfcuk has entered the debate. Published in memory of Matthew Harding, the club's former vice-chairman who spent millions on the club, they don't want the embarrassment of Lampard being jeered and abused by fans who once worshipped him. In a strong editorial in this month's edition, cfcuk – who had a good relationship with Lampard when he played for the club - outlined their position. 'Many readers and other observers have asked whether we will begin to turn our backs on him, now he is doing well at Chelsea's main Premier League rivals. 'Like all Chelsea supporters, we would have preferred him to have worked out a deal that would have seen him stay at Stamford Bridge but, failing that, we wish he had gone straight to New York City rather than to another English team, especially the Etihad side. Chelsea fans supported Lampard when he played against Chelsea at the Etihad in September 2014 . As Lampard prepares for a return to Stamford Bridge, a leading fanzine has asked Chelsea fans to cheer him . 'That said, the majority of the regular contributors to this fanzine are of the opinion that Lampard is still the greatest player they have seen in a Chelsea shirt and nothing – even match-winning performances for one of Chelsea's rivals – will bring about a change of mind. 'Those who say he is being disloyal to Chelsea by helping Manchester City are simply naïve. Should he play at Stamford Bridge, we hope that he will receive a good, appreciative reception from the home supporters before and after the match but, for the 90 minutes that the game is being played, they give their all in back the team in Royal Blue.' Lampard was given a good reception by Chelsea's away fans when he played against them at The Etihad and he didn't celebrate scoring City's equaliser in a 1-1 draw. Lampard (left) scored 211 goals in a Chelsea shirt before moving north to Manchester City . Jose Mourinho (left) and Lampard have a good relationship after two spells together at Chelsea . Another cfcuk contributor Dean Mears called for another show of support to their former hero this weekend, saying: 'Frank will be welcomed back to Stamford Bridge any time. He will get the same rousing reception as he did at the Etihad. 'That was a moment that made me proud to be a Chelsea supporter – we never forget our heroes, that is what we are all about. 'He might play in sky blue but Frank is Blue and always will be, even if he scores the winner agains us and gives City the title.' Lampard refuses to celebrate after scoring a late equaliser for Manchester City against Chelsea . Lampard (right) puts his hand up as though apologising to Chelsea fans after his goal against his old club . Lampard's former Chelsea team-mates Didier Drogba and John Obi Mikel have also appealed for Chelsea fans to applaud him back, but there is also a section of the Blues support who feel betrayed by their former hero and are refusing to give him a rousing reception. It was originally believed Lampard would have left for America by the time this fixture arrived but Manchester City admitted they always had the player on a 12-month agreement. Chelsea are currently five points ahead of City at the top of the Premier League table. It is believed the club did not offer Lampard a new contract to stay at Stamford Bridge when his last deal expired in the summer. His Chelsea highlight was standing in for the suspended John Terry when the club won their first Champions League title against Bayern Munich in 2012.","Frank Lampard will return to Stamford Bridge with Man City on Saturday .

"Former Portugal international Luis Figo has announced he is going to stand for FIFA presidency. The 42-year-old has the support of five FIFA member federations - the minimum requirement needed for a candidate to enter May's vote. Figo is the second high-profile former player to enter the race after David Ginola declared his intention to run earlier in the month - although the former Newcastle and Tottenham winger is yet to secure the support of five federations. Luis Figo announced his intention to stand for the FIFA presidency on Wednesday . Figo says he wants to help clean up the scandal-ridden image of FIFA . Figo has the support of five FIFA member associations - meaning he can stand for the May ballot . Figo's standing means there should now be at least four candidates in the contest after nominations close on Friday. As well as incumbent president Sepp Blatter and Figo, Jordan's Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein and Dutch FA president Michael van Praag are standing. Another candidate is French former diplomat Jerome Champagne, who is yet to get the support he needs but could do so. Figo told CNN: 'I care about football, so what I'm seeing regarding the image of FIFA - not only now but in the past years - I don't like it. Figo avoids a challenge during Real Madrid's 2-1 Champions League final win over Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 . Figo in action for Real Madrid against Porto in the 2003 Champions League . Figo won 127 international caps for his native Portugal and scored 32 goals . Luis Figo played for Barcelona for five years before moving to rivals Real in 2000 . Age: 42 . Club career: . Sporting (1989–1995) - 137 apps, 16 goals . Barcelona (1995–2000) - 172 apps, 30 goals . Real Madrid (2000–2005) - 164 apps, 38 goals . Inter (2005–2009)- 105 apps, 9 goals . International career: . Portugal 127 caps, 32 goals . Major honours: . Barcelona - 2 La Liga titles, 2 Copa del Reys, 1 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, 1 UEFA Super Cup . Real Madrid - 2 La Liga titles, 1 Champions League, 1 UEFA Super Cup . Inter Milan - 4 Serie A titles, 1 Coppa Italia . Individual honours: . Portuguese Football of the Year (1995-2000) Ballon d'Or (2000) 'If you search FIFA on the internet you see the first word that comes out: scandal - not positive words. It's that we have to change first and try to improve the image of FIFA. Football deserves much better than this. 'I've been talking with so many important people in football - players, managers, president of federations - and they all think that something has to be done. 'Last year was the World Cup, I was in Brazil and I saw the reaction of all the fans regarding the image of FIFA and I think something has to be changed. 'Change in leadership, governance, transparency and solidarity, so I think it's the moment for that.' Figo later tweeted: 'I'm delighted to announce my candidacy for the FIFA Presidency. Football has given me so much during my life & I want to give something back.' Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has backed his compatriot, saying: 'Luis Figo's candidacy is a great step forward for football. His career over many years guarantees a better future for FIFA. 'I believe in his character and determination, as well as his passion for the game. He will be a president focused on football and its general improvement, acting closely with all federations.' Southampton manager Ronald Koeman, who coached Figo at Barcelona for two years, also believes the Portuguese can help change FIFA for the better. He said: 'Figo’s candidacy is an opportunity for the change of FIFA. I know him personally and I know that this is a decision based on the need of giving a new direction to an institution that suffered extensive damage in the past years.' The Scottish Football Association confirmed it will be one of the five national associations that will nominate Van Praag, a fierce critic of Blatter's. Van Praag will confirm the others involved at a news conference in Amsterdam on Wednesday. Prince Ali Bin al Hussein (left) hopes to challenge Sepp Blatter and will have the support of the FA . Former Tottenham and Newcastle winger David Ginola has also entered the race to oust Blatter . Former FIFA deputy secretary general Jerome Champagne is also standing as a candidate . An SFA spokesman said: 'We can confirm that the Scottish FA are one of the five associations nominating Mr Van Praag.' Prince Ali is expected to be nominated by the Football Association - FA chairman Greg Dyke is understood to have offered the association's backing to Prince Ali and discussions have taken place between board members ahead of a meeting on Thursday after which it is expected to be formally announced. The FA board's view is that the more reformist candidates who enter the contest the better. Sepp Blatter . Twinkly-eyed, charismatic, grandfatherly figure to some; ruthless James Bond movie villain who has overseen years of corruption to others. The 78-year-old is seeking a fifth term as FIFA president and despite the outpouring of bad publicity about him is the clear favourite to win. Luis Figo . Grew up in a tough Lisbon neighbourhood to become Portugal's most capped footballer, a world player of the year and a handsome poster boy for football. More recently the 42-year-old has worked for Inter Milan and on UNICEF projects. Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein . A FIFA vice-president already, the prince from Jordan is a former special forces solider and, according to his website, a direct descendant of the prophet Muhammad. The 39-year-old has backing among those wanting further reform of FIFA including the English Football Association but will struggle to gain support even in his home confederation of Asia. Michael van Praag . Former chairman of Ajax, and son of Jaap van Praag who filled that role during the glory years, he has head of the Dutch FA for six years. An outspoken critic of Sepp Blatter's, the 67-year-old, who has been nominated by the Scottish FA among others, has pressed UEFA hard to put forward a rival candidate. Jerome Champagne . French former diplomat who worked closely with Sepp Blatter for more than a decade at FIFA before being banished to the wilderness. Still close to Blatter and very anti-UEFA, the 56-year-old has had to fight off suggestions he is merely a stooge - and has done so by releasing a detailed manifesto. David Ginola . Has become the joke candidate of the FIFA presidential contest and will probably not even get a single nomination. The former Tottenham and France winger's campaign ended as soon as it started when it was revealed the 48-year-old was getting paid £250,000 by a bookmaker to run, and stands to earn even more via a cut of donations from wellwishers.","Luis Figo has the support of five member nations and will run .

"On a day made remarkable by many things, not least the sheer scale of the turnout, the courage of one man was always going to shine through. Staring death in the face but refusing to flinch, Fernando Ricksen deserved every full-throated cheer and moist-eyed tribute delivered at Ibrox yesterday. Crippled by the motor-neurone disease that will eventually claim his life, Ricksen was just able to take the ceremonial kick-off in an exhibition match between a Rangers Select and Fernando's All Stars, stumbling and tumbling to the turf moments after making contact with the ball. An emotional Fernando Ricksen was carried around the stadium at the end of a tribute match at Ibrox . Ricksen (centre) was greeted by supporters after arriving at Ibrox for the game . If that was a heartbreaking sight for all who turned out to thank the Dutchman for his contribution to the club, it is worth noting what happened after he fell down. He got back up. With the help of his former team-mates, he rose again to take the applause of 41,349 paying punters. Why were so many moved to venture forth on a dreich winter's day for a bounce game involving old boys in varying states of (dis)repair? It was an appreciation not just of what Ricksen did in his playing days, but of how he is facing down this horrifying illness. 'Even the fact that MND patients don't have more than three years to live doesn't get me down,' he said in an interview conducted for the commemorative programme. 'Scared? No, because what's going to happen is inevitable. OK, maybe I have only a couple of years left. That doesn't scare me, it's just that I would love to live a lot longer. I want to see my daughter growing up. That's what I'll fight for. 'One person should be the first to defeat this terrible disease. Well, let me be that person then! I will show the world what fighting spirit means. 'But if death comes, well, it comes. What can you do about it? I've always been like that. Never been afraid of flying either, unlike most of my Russian team-mates (from his time with Dick Advocaat at Zenit St Petersburg). 'I always told them: 'If we go down, we go down'. Which was quite likely with those Russian aircraft, by the way! Ricksen (left) watches on from the dugout during the match at Ibrox . Ricksen (centre) is carried by Ronald de Boer (left) and Thomas Buffel (right . 'I don't want to feel too much sympathy. I am not pitiful. Please don't treat me that way. It will be tough but I'll keep my head up. 'It was a shock (when I got the diagnosis). Especially after I had Googled what the illness exactly means. All of a sudden, you know you may be dead within a year. 'I still hope the doctors have made a mistake. That, one day, they will say it isn't MND. As long as I don't have the really heavy symptoms of MND, it's a straw I keep grasping at. 'I know it sounds strange but being chased by the Grim Reaper doesn't affect your life that much. Not when your motto is: 'Don't look back'. 'We avoid pessimism and depression by not talking and thinking too much about the disease. That's one of the reasons why we don't shoot an enormous amount of footage of our life as it is today. 'For my daughter, Isabella, that would put too much emphasis on the illness.' Ibrox was packed full of supporters offering tributes to former player Ricksen . The money raised from yesterday's match will be split four ways, with Ricksen and young Isabella each receiving a share, and the remainder going to MND Scotland and the Rangers Charity Foundation. Among those to have contributed include old foes Celtic — with a £10,000 donation — a fact that didn't greatly surprise the man himself, as he revealed: 'It isn't true that all Celtic supporters have always hated me. 'When I was playing for Zenit, lots of Scottish tourists wanted to have their picture taken with me on the Red Square — even Celtic fans. That was very rewarding. So I must have done something good.' Ricksen had been back to Ibrox in a playing role since his departure for Rangers, turning out for Zenit in a friendly. But yesterday was different. In a very familiar way. The crazy traffic, the huge queues that saw kick-off delayed by half an hour, it was like a throwback to more successful times in Govan. Former Rangers winger Neil McCann noted: 'It's great to see such a big crowd at Ibrox again. I gave Fernando a hug and said: 'This feels like the old times'.' Fans held banners, scarfs and signs and chanted Ricksen's name during the tribute . The former Old Firm warrior was accompanied by Isabella as he made his way between a guard of honour formed by both teams before kick-off, the atmosphere creeping closer to spine-tingling levels as he slowly marched out. With his ability to speak severely damaged by the disease, the look of joy on Ricksen's face said as much as words ever could. The game itself was, of course, an afterthought, a 7-4 romp for the All Stars. Gordon Durie, Peter Lovenkrands, Thomas Buffel and Nacho Novo scored for the home team, while James Beattie was among the many visitors to find the net — the first time this particular former Rangers player had ever scored at Ibrox. There was only one choice for Man of the Match, though, Ricksen lauded again as his name was announced, then receiving a further standing ovation as he came back on the pitch for a lap of honour. He was carried aloft on the shoulders his team-mates, borne ever higher by the goodwill of all in attendance. Ricksen (centre) lifts the Scottish Premier League trophy as a player for the club in 2005 . And the last word went to the man himself, in a way, too, when his close friend Roy Knez read out a statement on his behalf declaring: 'Fellow Blue Noses, thank you for your support today. The numbers who turned out make me feel so happy. It gives me a fighting spirit. 'When I played here, I gave everything for the world's most successful club. Now the club and the fans have given me so much more back. I need it now. 'I've never been so proud to be a Rangers man. Thank you. I love you. Rangers forever.'","Former Rangers captain Fernando Ricksen has motor-neurone disease .

"Roberto Mancini has implored Yaya Toure to move to Italy in the summer as he wants the midfielder to become his lynchpin at Inter Milan. The Ivorian's future at Manchester City has been an ongoing concern since the summer and it appeared he would be on his way. The situation appears to have settled in recent months - he has won games on his own for City this season - but whether the Etihad Stadium will be home to the 31-year-old much longer remains up in the air. Yaya Toure should move to Serie A in Italy, claims Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini . The pair won the Premier League title together as Manchester City became a powerhouse in England . Toure signed for City in 2010 alongside Aleksandar Kolarov (left), David Silva and Jerome Boateng . And Mancini, who signed Toure from Barcelona back in 2010, wants him to think about a move to the San Siro. 'Yaya is one of the best players in the world,' Mancini said in an interview with Il Giornale. 'He still would be [if he came to Italy]. He's played for a lot of teams. 'He's been to Belgium, Russia, Spain and England, but he's missing Italy. It could be a good opportunity for him to come and try.' The midfielder is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast . While it is highly unlikely that Toure will forego Champions League football - Inter are way behind the top four in Serie A - but Mancini believes they could actually lure him to the club. 'We're building, but there are players who can immediately change the face of a team and Yaya is one of them,' he added. 'Next year we can prove ourselves, with three signings you'll see that we'll be ready for the Scudetto fight.","Roberto Mancini would like to sign Yaya Toure at Inter Milan .

"A motorist has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving after he was stopped speeding at 100mph - more than three times the limit. The driver failed a breath test, blowing a reading of more than double the drink-drive level, after his vehicle was seen travelling at around 100mph in a 30mph limit zone. Officers arrested the man after pulling him over on a section of the Aston Expressway A38(M) in Birmingham, which had a temporary 30mph restriction at the time. A motorist was stopped speeding at 100mph, more than three times the temporary 30mph limit, on the Aston Expressway A38(M) In a tweet early this morning, Central Motorway Police Group said the man had given a reading of 74 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath, more than double the 35 microgram legal limit. It said: 'Vehicle stopped on a38(m) having been travelling at 100mph in temp 30mph area. Driver arrested for drink driving having blown 74.' Another tweet said: 'Two more drink drivers through the night, 1 drew attention to himself by driving in excess of 100mph and was twice over drink drive limit.' The fastest speeding motorist in Britain is thought to be getaway driver Ben Westwood, 33, who reached speeds of up to 180mph as he fled police during a 65-mile chase in 2012. During the pursuit on the M6, his stolen Audi RS5 almost outran a police helicopter and left officers in high-performance BMWs trailing in his wake. Officers from Central Motorway Police Group arrested the motorist on suspicion of drink-driving this morning . Westwood was jailed for a total of nine years after he was found guilty of dangerous driving, conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to steal. Before him, Timothy Brady was thought to be Britain's fastest speeder. He was jailed for 10 weeks after admitting clocking up 172mph while driving his new Porsche 911 on the A420 in Oxfordshire in 2007.

"Rapist footballer Ched Evans, pictured this week, claims he has new evidence he believes will help him overturn his conviction and help him return to professional football . Rapist footballer Ched Evans claimed on Wednesday he has new evidence he believes will help him overturn his conviction. The disgraced striker, 26, maintains he is 'innocent' of attacking his victim in a Rhyl hotel room in 2011 because he believes the sex was consensual. Evans has successfully applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to have his 2012 conviction re-examined, but sent a new bundle of evidence to them on Friday. A statement on his website on Wednesday said: 'Further detailed submissions - supported by previously unavailable fresh evidence that we believe strengthens Ched's application - were lodged with the Commission.' His solicitor has told MailOnline on Wednesday that he is confident that the disgraced former Sheffield United striker will be cleared. Shaun Draycott said: 'We have fresh evidence that has been submitted late last week. 'We feel it is a strong case and I remain deeply concerned about Ched's conviction and we are hopeful that his application will lead to his case being referred to the Court of Appeal. 'But I cannot discuss the details of the application only to say it is very detailed and builds on the evidence submitted last July and includes fresh evidence'. The footballer's legal team has handed its latest file of evidence to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which considers if convictions are unsafe. If they believe there is a case they then refer it to the Court of Appeal where judges will consider whether to overturn the conviction  or order a retrial. This process could take up to a year to complete meaning Evans is unlikely to return to football before 2016 if he is cleared. MailOnline understands that Evans’ fresh submission may be connected to evidence not used at his trial by the prosecution that may have helped his case if it had been disclosed to the defence at the time. Since his release from jail last year Evans has become engaged to his girlfriend Natasha Massey, who has stood by him throughout his trial and conviction . The Criminal Cases Review Commission has confirmed it has received the new legal bundle but would not discuss the case. Evans was released from prison last October after completing half of a five-year jail sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman. Ched Evans has a website run by supporters and sets out why the footballer believes he is innocent . The Welsh striker denied rape, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court. The prosecution said the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was too drunk to consent to sexual intercourse. The woman was raped his victim in a Rhyl Premier Inn in 2012 after his footballer friend Clayton McDonald, who was cleared of rape, texted Evans on the way there saying: 'I've got a bird'. McDonald had sex with the victim, before Evans arrived and raped her, as two others filmed it through the window. After his release from jail his old club Sheffield United, who used to pay him £20,000-a-week, agreed to let him train with them. But the League One club was plunged into crisis when three patrons quit, fans threatened a boycott and its main sponsor warned it would scrap their deal if they tried to sign him. The club's bosses were accused of 'dragging the club through the mud' for bringing the 25-year-old back to training this week. Sky TV presenter Charlie Webster resigned her role as club patron in protest followed by Lindsay Graham and sixties pop star Dave Berry. Sky TV presenter Charlie Webster resigned her role as club patron and Jessica Ennis-Hill said she wanted her name pulled off a stand if Evans signed . Miss Webster, who was abused as a child herself, said: 'At no point have Sheffield United acknowledged the extremity of his crime. I don't believe a convicted rapist as in Ched Evans should go back to a club I am a patron of'. Olympic heptathlon champion and Blades fan Jessica Ennis-Hill then issued a statement announcing that she has told United she would want her name removed from the Bramall Lane stand should Evans be offered a contract to play for the club. Earlier this month he finally apologised to the woman he raped for the first time after a deal to sign for Oldham Athletic collapsed at the last minute. Oldham became the fourth club to turn down the chance to sign the former Wales and Sheffield United striker, and Evans blamed 'mob rule'. He said in a statement: 'Whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned'. May 2011 Ched Evans arrested on suspicion of sexual assault at a Premier Inn near Rhyl, North Wales. Evans and fellow footballer Clayton McDonald are later charged with rape. April 2012: Evans is jailed for five years for rape and McDonald is acquitted. Evans' lawyers announce he is to appeal against his conviction. August 2012: The first stage of Evans' appeal is rejected after a judge had refuses his application for leave to appeal against his conviction. He is released by Sheffield United. November 5 2012: Nine people plead guilty to revealing the identity of Evans' victim online with some of the comments calling her names like 'money grabbing whore' and 'poor little victim'. November 6 2012: Evans loses his appeal after his case is rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in London. April 2014: An online petition is launched urging United not to re-sign Evans and gains over 165,000 signatures. October 17 2014: Evans is released from prison after serving half his sentence and a statement is released on his website stating he will continue to fight to clear his name. October 19 2014: The Criminal Cases Review Commission confirm they are to fast-track Evans' case to investigate whether his conviction will be referred to the Court of Appeal. November 11 2014: Sheffield United confirm Evans will return to train with the club with immediate effect following a request from the Professional Footballers' Association. Television presenter Charlie Webster stands down as a patron of Sheffield United. November 12 2014: Two more patrons resign and Olympic heptathlon champion and Blades fan Jessica Ennis-Hill issues a statement announcing that she has told United she would want her name removed from the Bramall Lane stand should Evans be offered a contract to play for the club.

November 20 2014: Sheffield United announce they have retracted the offer for Evans to train with the club. November 27 2014: Tranmere chairman Mark Palios turns down an offer to sign Evans . January 8 2015: Oldham release statement saying they will not offer Evans a contract or chance to sign for the club.  Evans blames 'mob rule' putting pressure on sponsors.

"Former Rangers midfielder Gennaro Gattuso insists he would love to return to Ibrox as boss - but only once the club's boardroom battle has been settled. The Italian World Cup winner, 37, has been linked with the post vacated by Ally McCoist last month. But Gattuso - who was just 19 when he was signed for former Ibrox boss Walter Smith - believes there is no point opening negotiations while there are so many factions fighting for control of the club. Former Rangers midfielder Gennaro Gattuso admits he is interested in returning to the club as manager . Newcastle United's billionaire owner Mike Ashley is one of the suitors competing for control of Rangers . Mike Ashley is expected to hand chairman David Somers a second emergency loan just in time for Thursday's pay cheques to go out. But Dave King and the Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - are rallying their troops ahead of a general meeting which could spell the end of the current directors' reign. Ex-Sion and Palermo manager Gattuso, who was back at Ibrox to play in Fernando Ricksen's charity match on Sunday, said: 'I still have a lot of memories here. It was 15 years ago that I started to play here. I felt the same running out there again. I'm maybe carrying five of six kilos more but it still felt fantastic. 'But now the club has big problems. They need to find a way of solving those. 'Of course I would be interested in the vacancy. I stopped playing two years ago. Now my job is to become a coach. That's normal. 'But at this time the road [to the Rangers job] is far away. 'We can speak but the problem now is that there is not one chairman but five people in control of the club. It's difficult.' Former fan favourite Gattuso signed for Rangers when he was just 19 years old under Walter Smith in 1997 . Gattuso tussles with Arsenal's Gael Clichy during the Champions League quarter-final at the San Siro . Gattuso - who was overlooked by Hamilton as they named Martin Canning their new boss last week - added: 'I know the club has big problems at this moment but Rangers is still a big club with a big story behind it. 'For me it would be a big honour to manage this club and a big opportunity.' Gattuso, who also lifted the Champions League trophy twice while playing for AC Milan, left the Glasgow giants two years before Ricksen arrived in 2000. But he was still one of the many former Ibrox favourites who turned out to honour the Dutchman as he battles Motor Neurone Disease. It was an emotional day as Ricksen, clearly frail, took the applause of over 41,000 supporters. 'It was an fantastic atmosphere for Fernando,' said Gattuso, 37. 'A beautiful day. I haven't seen Ibrox for a long time but Sunday was unbelievable. 'Life can be very strange. It was very difficult on Sunday. I saw Fernando two years ago and he was a different man with no problems. Now it is hard even to speak to him because he doesn't speak very well. 'He doesn't move very well either but that's okay. I think it is good for him to have been here and seen what he means to these fans. 'For 41,000 supporters to come out only for him is fantastic.' Marco Negri (left) and Des Walker (right) in action during the Fernando Ricksen Tribute match at Ibrox . Former Rangers right-back Ricksen, 38, has been diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease . And Gattuso believes those same fans will have an important role to play next Sunday when the current Ibrox side take on Celtic in the League Cup semi-finals. Large swathes of the Rangers faithful have boycotted home matches this season as their fall-out with the board continues. The Hoops are the overwhelming favourites to go through but the Hampden clash is already a sell-out. But Gattuso said: 'Of course Rangers have a chance. I think the supporters will help the team. An Old Firm game in front of 10 or 20,000 supporters is not the same. 'The best happens when a lot of Rangers supporters come to the stadium and shout a lot to help the team.'

"Celtic idol Alan Thompson has revealed how his two-year rift with former Parkhead boss Neil Lennon has finally ended. Lennon dismissed his best friend and colleague in the summer of 2012 amid allegations and whispers over Thompson's off-field lifestyle. Admitting the loss of his job placed him in a 'bad place' Thompson, a veteran of Martin O'Neill's Seville team, is back in football as assistant manager to Lee Clark at Championship Blackpool. Celtic idol Alan Thompson has revealed how his two-year rift with  Neil Lennon has finally ended . And after clear the air talks with Bolton boss Lennon in recent months Thompson says the pair are trying to repair their relationship. 'I have spoken to Lenny on a few occasions recently,' said Thompson in a wide-ranging Sportsmail interview. 'Those are the first conversations for a long, long time and what happened is now put to bed, we've moved on. We speak. We speak. 'We are not as we were before when we were best mates. But we are on speaking terms.' Dismissed just six weeks after Celtic won their last match with Rangers 3-0, securing the first title of three-in-a-row, Thompson now regards it as one of the blackest periods of his life, but insists: 'I'm over all that now. I felt let down at the time but I don't want to go into that. 'That was disappointing, a real, real bad time. Blackpool assistant Thompson talks to Sportsmail's Stephen McGowan . 'As I say, I'm over it now. I'm looking forward, not back. 'People said stuff about me at the time and that was hard - but I know what football is like. 'I can't do anything about all that. What happened happened. 'I know what really happened. How things developed and how they ended wasn't ideal.' Cutting himself off from his former teammates for over a year Thompson says the bonds between O'Neill's tight-knit Parkhead side are now healing after the wounds created by his sacking. 'There was a Stilian Petrov benefit game up at Parkhead last year and at that time I just wanted to keep out the way. 'It was Stan's day and I didn't want anything detracting from that. 'Neil and I hadn't spoken at that time – but I have seen him three or four times since. The two were close friends before Lennon dismissed Thompson in the summer of 2012 . 'He has given me his views and I have given him mine and we move on. 'Life is short. I have nothing but respect for Neil and I'm glad it's done and dusted and that we can get on with our lives and careers. 'I was down in Norwich a few weeks ago and had a glass of wine with Chris Sutton. 'You talk about good times and who is doing what now. 'The way I left Celtic as a player and a coach was never ideal, but that's what happens. 'I'm sure a lot of Celtic fans will appreciate what I did for the club and that we all have some good memories.'

Fans on both sides, as well as neutral bystanders, can only hope that the return of Scottish football’s most intense rivalry doesn’t create the kind of febrile fury that rained down from the steep slopes of Celtic Park almost 16 years ago. ‘I know what this game can be like, I remember 1999,’ says Neil McCann, the former Rangers winger, before quickly adding: ‘But I don’t think Sunday will be like that - I hope not. ‘It’s fair to say that was the most volatile game I have been involved in. Anything that could happen did happen that day, on and off the field. Rangers' Neil McCann celebrates scoring the opening goal during the game on May 2 against Celtic . McCann put Rangers on their way to a 3-0 win over Celtic away from home in an iconic Scottish rivalry tie . McCann also scored the third goal as Celtic lost 3-0 in Scottish football's most intense rivalry . 13 mins: Giovanni van Bronckhorst slides in Rod Wallace on the left wing and his cross is touched past Stewart Kerr by Neil McCann to hand Rangers an early lead. Celtic’s defence, including on-loan Scott Marshall, is nowhere. 31 mins: Celtic defender Stephane Mahe, who has already been booked, reacts badly to a tackle by McCann and is sent off by Hugh Dallas. Furious Mahe has to be dragged off the park. 41 mins: A minute after a fan runs on the pitch, a coin is flung from the stands and hits Dallas, flooring the whistler. His cut forehead later needs four stitches. 43 mins: Dallas recovers and awards a penalty to Rangers after Vidar Riseth is adjudged to have pulled Tony Vidmar back in the box, prompting some more fans to invade the pitch. Jorg Albertz converts the spot kick. 53 mins: Celtic keeper Stewart Kerr is only booked despite handling the ball outside the box. Kerr is one of 10 players cautioned throughout the sorry proceedings. 76 mins: Dick Advocaat’s side seal the match - and the title - Neil McCann nets his second goal of the evening after sprinting clear of the floundering Celtic defence. 86 mins: Rangers striker Wallace is shown a red card for a furious reaction to Riseth’s late challenge on him. 90 mins: Riseth is shown the third red card for a second booking after a lunge on Vidmar beside the corner flag. Full time: Rangers players celebrate winning the title at the home of their fierce rivals for the first time by indulging in their own verson of the Celtic Huddle. Missiles are thrown as they make their way to the dressing room. ‘I am confident it won’t get to that stage. There were a lot of things that happened away from the park that day that you don’t see but, in terms of the actual game, it was one of the most eventful Old Firm games in memory.’ The notoriety of that May clash at Celtic Park has endured well enough, although it’s still worth recalling some of the key facts surrounding the title-clinching 3-0 win for the visitors. None of it makes for pretty reading. More than 100 fans were arrested. Three players - Celtic’s Stephane Mahe, Vidar Riseth and Rangers’ Rod Wallace - were sent off. Referee Hugh Dallas was left bloodied by a missile thrown from the crowd, then had the windows of his home smashed afterwards. One man was stabbed outside the ground, while others sustained injuries in the battles that followed the game. There were pitch invaders, a victorious Rangers team mocking the Celtic huddle – and being pelted with missiles for their cheek – while it all ended with multiple inquiries and, in the best tradition, questions in the House. Which rather puts Ally McCoist and Neil Lennon snarling at each other on the touchline in perspective, doesn’t it? McCann, whose two goals - allied to a Jorg Albertz penalty - were overshadowed by the atrocious scenes, was brave enough to admit after the game that he’d been frightened for his own personal safety. He echoed the thoughts of a vast majority when he said: ‘Sunday is a huge fixture but, because there has not been a game of this magnitude for a number of years, the most important thing is it passes safely. ‘That’s the biggest concern. I don’t know if it will be harder to police because it is a neutral venue. If it was a home game then the away fans can be shepherded in. But hopefully it can be a good event, as it’s one that’s been sorely missed.’ The good news for all is that, while anyone who saw the ring of police surrounding the pitch for the closing stages of that game in 1999 might have considered this fixture beyond reprisal, it did recover. As ugly as it has been at times, as horrible as the atmosphere may be in bar rooms and front rooms beyond the control of police and stewards, we haven’t seen anything approaching that level of trouble since. Long may it continue. Celtic's Stephane Mahe, who was sent off during the 3-0 defeat, clashes with Rangers winger McCann . More than 100 fans were arrested that day as Rangers won 3-0 at Celtic Park . Celtic: Kerr, Annoni, Marshall, Stubbs, Riseth, Mahe, Lambert, Wieghorst, Larsson, Viduka, Brattbakk . Subs: Donnelly, Johnson, Healy, Burchill, Corr . Sent off: Mahe (31), Riseth (90) Rangers: Klos, Porrini, Amoruso, Vidmar, Hendry, Van Bronckhorst, Albertz, McCann, Reyna, Wallace, Amato . Subs: Niemi, McInnes, Johansson, Wilson, Riccio . Sent off: Wallace (86) Goals: McCann (12, 76), Albertz (44 pen) Attendance: 59,918 . There are dark murmurings ahead of Sunday, of course, with some wondering what might happen if – and it’s a possibility – a very strong Celtic side simply steamroller their opponents. ‘I’m not saying that is going to happen,’ said McCann, when asked about he subject of any on-field events provoking violence. ‘It comes down to supporters having a responsibility. You can never account for everyone but the most important thing is the safety aspect. ‘Hopefully everyone can enjoy the occasion and welcome back the Old Firm fixture.’ Enjoyment for those blessed/cursed to spend their lives supporting one side or the other is, of course, entirely dependent upon how their team fare. It’s hardly outrageous to suggest that optimism is more prevalent among Celtic than Rangers supporters at present. McCann conceded: ‘Rangers are in real trouble at the moment. The sides are worlds apart in terms of the performances on the pitch. It could be really tough for Rangers. ‘You just want to see Rangers back for the good of Scottish football. We knew this game would come around. We would have liked to see it in the top league but it’s the cup and one team are going in very strong and another who are a lot weaker. ‘But I still believe Rangers have guys in that squad who, if they get things right tactically, there is a chance an upset could happen. Celtic’s  Mahe, Vidar Riseth and Rangers’ Rod Wallace were all sent off as McCann's side won 3-0 . Referee Hugh Dallas was hit by a missile thrown from the crowd then had the windows of his home smashed . ‘I say upset because the odds are massively against Rangers, because of the way things are at the moment. ‘Kenny McDowall has to be well prepared and get the players ready for it. He needs to get a level of performance out of them that’s a lot higher than we have seen this season. ‘At this moment you’ve got to fear the worst - but you never know. Celtic are a strong side and they have a lot of confidence and swagger. But Rangers fans will still expect a performance and a result though, regardless. ‘The phrase “nothing to lose” doesn’t apply in an Old Firm game. You could say a lot of people might not expect you to get a result - but there’s always something to lose in an Old Firm game. ‘I’ve experienced both sides. I was on the end of a hiding after the 6-2 game at Celtic Park. That wasn’t good, I locked myself away for a week until the storm passed. I’ve been on the other side after winning. ‘It doesn’t matter how you go into the match, whether you are strong and in form, it can never be viewed as a meaningless match. It doesn’t matter if they haven’t played for a few years. It’s still Celtic v Rangers and there is so much history. The game in May of 1999 was among the most fierce between Scotland's two intense rivals . McCann was a feature of the day but even the Rangers man admits anything could happen on and off the pitch . ‘You can never be ready for it unless you’ve experienced it, no matter what advice you get from the guys who have played in it 20 times. Nothing prepares you for when you walk out.’ The atmosphere on Sunday may surpass almost anything experienced by even hardened Old Firm fans in the modern era, with absence having hardened the edge on a rivalry that has always been on the keen side of sharp, to say the very least. For the love of all that is still bonny about the beautiful game, let’s all hope that the heat and noise at Hampden is contained, controlled and kept within the bounds of acceptable responsibility. However the game itself goes, the last thing Scottish football needs is even a handful of half-wits deciding to rammy like it’s 1999.","Celtic and Rangers played on May 2, 1999, when three players were sent off and more than 100 fans were arrested .

"A second customer has fallen ill after drinking a free coffee from Waitrose that was contaminated with cleaning fluid. Father-of-two David Sack was in a rush when he grabbed a free cappuccino at the branch in West Byfleet, Surrey, but felt sick after drinking it. The 49-year-old, from Dorking, Surrey, went to his GP who then advised him to go to accident and emergency, but he decided against it. It comes just two weeks after a woman in Lewes, East Sussex, was hospitalised after drinking a coffee given away as part of the chain's membership card scheme. Agony: David Sack fell ill after drinking a cup of coffee from Waitrose which contained cleaning chemicals . Drink: The father-of-two had to go to see his GP and was advised to visit hospital for treatment . The supermarket chain apologised to Mr Sack, and offered him £25 compensation, but he returned the money because the amount was 'insulting'. He was then presented with £100, but was pestered by staff telling him he only had 14 days to decide whether to take the cash. Mr Sack eventually took the money, but was frustrated because it was a 'serious matter' that could have had severe consequences. 'I noticed that the machine only half filled the cup so I brought this to the attention of a staff member nearby, who came over to look at the machine,' he said. 'As I was short of time, and not wanting to wait for the fault to be rectified, I took what coffee I had and returned to the school bus I was driving. Branch: Mr Sack, a gardener, picked up the coffee from the store West Byfleet, Surrey . The advert reads: Nothing says 'welcome' more than a lovely hot cup of tea or coffee . 'I was pleased that the coffee wasn’t as hot as usual, enabling me to take a large glup. 'I . realised, as I swallowed the liquid it wasn’t all coffee, having a . bitter chemical flavour. My tongue and roof of my mouth started burning. I felt sick. 'I drove to the school feeling increasingly unwell. I had a headache. On arrival I was sick. My throat was sore and burning. Reward: Cups of coffee are being given away in the stores as part of a membership loyalty scheme . 'I telephoned the store, briefly explaining what had happened. Staff at the store then read the health advice on the cleaning fluid and told him to drink plenty of water. 'At home I was sick again, and felt ill for the remainder of the day,' he added. 'When I contacted the staff, they did not say much, but claimed to have changed their policy. 'I had been a daily customer at the store, but now I have no need to go back.' A spokesman for Waitrose said: 'We are so sorry this happened. 'We use very diluted cleaner to wash through our machines, but Mr Sack should not have been able to pour a drink while the machine was being rinsed - and we have taken action to prevent it happening again.' Two weeks ago, paramedics were called to the Lewes, East Sussex branch of the supermarket and advised a woman to visit a specialist burns unit after drinking a coffee that had been contaminated with similar chemicals.

"Celtic have kicked out a £3million move for defender Efe Ambrose from Greek giants Olympiacos. Sportsmail understands the Greek league leaders enquired over the Nigerian’s availability with a view to concluding a deal before the close of the transfer window. Scouring Europe for central defensive reinforcements, new Olympiacos coach Vitor Pereira has already tried for Portuguese defender Bruno Alves and West Brom’s Joleen Lescott. Celtic have kicked out a £3million move for defender Efe Ambrose from Greek giants Olympiacos . Sportsmail understands the Greek league leaders enquired over the Nigerian’s availability this month . And he faces further disappointment with Ambrose after Parkhead coach Ronny Deila resolved to keep hold of his first-team regulars in the current window. The stopper had been linked with West Ham and Crystal Palace during Celtic’s winter trip to Gran Canaria, but the Norwegian shot down suggestions of an exit then when he said: ‘Efe is going to stay. That’s not true.’ Faced with a League Cup semi-final against Rangers and a Europa League last-32 clash with Inter Milan, Deila has set his sights on a domestic clean sweep and has asked the Celtic board to repel all moves for his top players. Fellow defender Virgil van Dijk is also wanted by Sunderland and Southampton, while Leeds have been eyeing a move for striker Anthony Stokes. Despite dropping out of the starting XI since Belgian Jason Denayer’s return from injury, however, Ambrose insists he is happy in Glasgow, saying earlier this month: ‘I am still a Celtic player and I will respect my contract. If an offer comes and Celtic accepts, fine. But otherwise, I will keep doing my best for Celtic and hopefully we will win the league again.’ Bolton have ended their interest in Celtic playmaker Kris Commons, who isn't for sale .

The Bolton manager said: ‘Celtic have come out publicly and said he’s not for sale, he won’t be leaving and we haven’t pursued that any further. ‘I’ve got a great relationship with Celtic, a great relationship with Peter [Lawwell] and I don’t want to damage that.’","Efe Ambrose was wanted by Greek giants Olympiacos .

"Fromer Celtic captain Tom Boyd has waded into the bitter Old Firm debate by labelling Rangers a new club. And the 49-year-old former Scotland skipper insists the Ibrox oufit simply aren't strong enough to pose any threat to the Scottish champions when they meet at Hampden on Sunday. The two Glasgow sides go head to head in the League Cup semi final for the first time since April 2012, three months before Rangers oldco were liquidated and a newco was subsequently accepted into the fourth-tier of Scottish football. Fromer Celtic captain Tom Boyd has waded into the bitter Old Firm debate by labelling Rangers a new club . The fixture has caused a re-emergence of the controversial and divisive debate over whether Rangers 'died' three years ago. At the weekend, Celtic fans paid for a full page advert in a Scottish broadsheet newspaper claiming Rangers were a new club and that the 'Old Firm' derby was dead. Former Rangers midfielder Alex Rae was one of several ex Ibrox aces to hit back, accusing Celtic fans of 'provocation'. And Parkhead greats Kenny Dalglish and Neil Lennon both insisted Sunday's fixture will be as important as any previous Old Firm derby. But Boyd, who won three Scottish titles, three League cups and two Scottish cups during his time at Celtic between 1992 and 2003, disagrees as he tipped defeat for Kenny McDowall's men at Hampden. 'I don't know what most people think but my opinion is that they are a new club,' Boyd told the Irish Herald. After a slow start to the season, Ronny Deila's Celtic are currently top of the Scottish Premiership . 'A lot of people believe it's a continuation of the game. I'd imagine that the atmosphere will be very much the same as previously but you can't compare the teams to the way that it was. The new Rangers are a (Scottish) Championship team, previously they had internationalists so the game isn't going to be the same. 'A lot of former players miss the actual match. That fixture was where players were judged and that's something that is no longer there because of the situation with the new Rangers and the problems they find themselves in. 'There are some Celtic supporters who go along with the continuation opinion. They want that game back, it's something that they miss. 'In Scottish football they feel that Celtic need a challenge. That fixture provided it - but I can't see the same with this match on Sunday.' Last month, SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster repeated the view of Lord Nimmo Smith, whose independent report into the Ibrox club's use of the controversial employee benefit trust (EBT) tax scheme insisted Rangers were not a new club. Kenny McDowall and Rangers, meanwhile are second in the Scottish Championship . Doncaster told the BBC: 'In terms of the question about old club, new club, that was settled very much by the Lord Nimmo Smith commission that was put together by the SPL to look at EBT payments at that time. 'The decision, very clearly from the commission, was that the club is the same, the club continues, albeit it is owned by a new company, but the club is the same. It's the same club, absolutely.' Off the field, Rangers remain mired in financial uncertainty in 2015. This week the under-fire board accepted a £10million crisis loan from Mike Ashley's Sports Direct empire to keep the lights on. Boyd is tipping Celtic, inspired by the returning striker Anthony Stokes – who missed Saturday's 1-0 win at Ross County - to add to the Ibrox woes by knocking them out of the cup on Sunday. He said: 'The Ross County game on Saturday was a little bit sticky but Celtic's recent form has been good in stages with some fantastic football played. 'The passing game that Celtic use could be too much for Rangers but my concern at the moment is that the conversion rate of chances isn't what it should be and that's not just to do with strikers. Hopefully that will change on Sunday. 'Having Anthony Stokes back in the side will be important. Last week against Motherwell he showed his value to the side with two great crosses for the opening goals. I'm sure he'll be looking forward to being involved in this match.'","Celtic and Rangers face each other on Saturday in the League Cup .

"The FA Cup has been an irrelevance to many clubs in recent years – but given the lack of success for most sides in the fifth-round draw, Wembley could be the greatest day out for a whole generation of fans. The weekend exits of Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham, Southampton and recent League Cup winners Swansea City have given some sleeping giants a real sniff of success at last.

Yet they are serial winners compared to fourth-round replay opponents Fulham, who have never won a major prize, or prospective fifth-round opponents Bradford City.

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho's unequivocal public support of his players in the face of criticism can only galvanise the squad for the challenges ahead, according to former Blues defender Frank Sinclair. Mourinho has been fined £25,000 and warned over his future conduct by the Football Association for claiming there was a 'clear campaign' against Chelsea earlier in the season. Following the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg win over Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night, the Portuguese manager vehemently defended striker Diego Costa, who could face an immediate three-match suspension after subsequently being charged for an apparent stamp on Reds defender Emre Can. Former Chelsea defender Frank Sinclair (right) was talking on behalf of Prostate Cancer UK . Jose Mourinho said there was a campaign against Chelsea following the 1-1 draw against Southampton . The Chelsea boss said there was 'a campaign' against his side when talking to Sky Sports . Sinclair, an ambassador for the Prostate Cancer UK Men United Campaign, believes Mourinho's stance will only serve to make the Chelsea dressing room stronger. 'Jose is a master of mind games, and the one thing he likes to have within his group is a siege mentality. He has always been like that and gets his group of players behind him, and makes sure they are all pushing in the right direction,' said Sinclair. 'When he has a press conference, he protects his players and that shows he is 100 per cent behind them and wants the players to be the same with him. When you speak to the players, that is the spirit they have got.' Chelsea host Manchester City on Saturday evening, looking to extend their five-point lead at the top of the table. Mourinho was also unhappy with referee Michael Oliver after side's Capital One Cup clash against Liverpool . Mourinho watches on as Diego Costa stands on Emre Can early in the first half at Stamford Bridge . While Sinclair, 43, believes the Blues have what it takes to see off a City side beaten at home by Arsenal in their last league match, he warned against any complacency over what the run-in could yet bring. 'It will be a tough game, but on the back of a great win in midweek, I would fancy Chelsea to get the result against Manchester City,' said Sinclair, who played more than 160 games for Chelsea between 1990 and 1998. 'As for the title, Manchester City have already pegged back a nine-point lead earlier in the season, so all it takes is for Chelsea to have another blip and all of a sudden City are back in the ball game. 'However, if Chelsea do win on Saturday, then you would not bet against them going on to win the championship with that advantage.' Chelsea will face Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley on March 1. Gary Cahill was disappointed to be replaced by Kurt Zouma against Liverpool on Tuesday . Cahill said he knows Mourinho's door is always open if he has an issue to discuss with him . Sinclair feels while the west London club have more pressing targets, to get a trophy back in the Stamford Bridge cabinet would only serve to inspire the players for the bigger challenges which await. 'It can breed confidence and be a spring board to what the main aims are for the season,' said Sinclair, who was part of Ruud Gullit's Chelsea side which won the FA Cup in 1997 and then also the League Cup the following season under new Blues manager Gianluca Vialli before joining Leicester. 'The priority will, of course, be to win the Premier League and go as far as possible in the Champions League, but for the likes of people like Diego Costa, who have come to the Premier League for the first time to play in such a big game at Wembley will stay with him for the rest of his life.' Frank Sinclair played more than 160 games for Chelsea between 1990 and 1998 . One of the latest initiatives from Prostate Cancer UK will see The Anchor Bankside pub, on London's South Bank, be temporarily known as 'The Men United Arms' from where activities will be run to help celebrate and inspire male friendships. Sinclair lost his uncle to prostate cancer seven years ago, and is determined to help beat the disease. He said: 'When you are in the sports industry, you almost feel you are invincible. You live the life of keeping fit naturally, training and playing, you kind of take it for granted, but at the same time you can't be aware of something that is not visible, so it is important to get the check-ups, especially if there is a history in the family.'

"Celtic risk being haunted by ‘disgrace’ and ‘shame’ if they fail to beat one of the weakest Rangers teams in Old Firm history, according to former Ibrox regular Bert Konterman. The Dutchman, scorer of a Treble-wrecking League Cup semi-final winner against Celtic back in 2002, is under no illusions about who should win Sunday’s Hampden clash. But he believes that the pressure of trying to avoid humiliation – and virulent abuse from their own fans – could work against Ronny Deila’s men, declaring: ‘If Celtic lose on Sunday it’s a disgrace for them. Bert Konterman (left) has experience in Old Firm derbies, having played for Rangers between 2000 and 2003 .

"When Chelsea walk up Wembley Way on March 1, the smart money is on them leaving with the Capital One Cup. Why? Because Jose Mourinho is the specialist in finals. Eleven down, nine trophies is among the best records ever to have been accumulated in Europe’s elite. You must tip your hat to the Portuguese given he’s managed it in four different countries, too. He is the man for the big occasion. To have lost just two finals in his time as a manager is nothing short of remarkable, but the way in which he’s lifted those trophies gives an insight into just why his record is so impressive. Jose Mourinho is in another final after Chelsea beat Liverpool in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night . Almost 50 per cent of these finals have gone to extra-time, including his first-ever trophy in the UEFA Cup against Celtic. It points to a boss who is insistent on definitely not losing, with his team invariably coming out on top, indicating their superior fitness levels as well. Tottenham take a one-goal lead to Sheffield United in the Capital one Cup semi-final second leg at Bramall Lane on Wednesday night and here, Sportsmail documents the frightening record of Mourinho and why Nigel Clough or Mauricio Pochettino shouldn’t fancy their chances a great deal if they reach the final. Branislav Ivanovic (right) celebrates after his winner took Chelsea through to a Wembley final on March 1 . 2003 – UEFA Cup (Porto 3-2 Celtic AET) On a Seville night heaped in drama, Porto twice blew a lead against Martin O’Neill’s Celtic before Bobo Balde’s extra-time sending off saw Dmitri Alenichev clinch a late winner and Mourinho’s first piece of silverware in European competition. Porto players celebrate after beating Martin O'Neill's Celtic to lift the 2003 UEFA Cup . Bobo Balde was shown a red card in Seville - the moment turned the final the way of Mourinho's side . 2003 – Taca de Portugal (Porto 1-0 UD Leiria) The UEFA Cup success was to be followed by a triumph in Portugal’s main cup competition a month later – Mourinho’s first domestic trophy of what would become a glittering career. Derlei scored the only goal against UD Leiria – the club he’d left just a year previous. Helder Postiga (left) was part of the Porto side to also win the Taca de Portugal that same season... 2004 – Taca de Portugal (Porto 1-2 Benfica AET) The only major final Mourinho lost in 10 years, Porto blew a lead through Derlei and eventually succumbed to Simao in extra-time at the Estadio Nacional. ...but they were to be beaten in the same competition by Benfica a year later (Nuno and Deco pictured) 2004 – Champions League (Porto 3-0 Monaco) The Portuguese’s crowning moment as manager of Porto. Mourinho could barely drink in the monumental achievement of winning the Champions League because his mind was already on other things – namely joining the Roman Abramovich revolution at Chelsea. They swept Monaco aside with embarrassing ease; Carlos Alberto (no, not that one), Deco and Alenichev scored the goals. Porto completed a double by comfortably beating Monaco in the Champions League final in 2004 . Mourinho was all smiles with Paulo Ferreira - a player he would later take with him to Chelsea . Porto had no problems sweeping aside Monaco, who were soundly beaten in Gelsenkirchen, Germany . 2005 - League Cup (Chelsea 3-2 Liverpool AET) The final to be remembered for that Steven Gerrard header through his own net at the Millennium Stadium – months before he turned Chelsea town to stay at Liverpool – was capped off by Mateja Kezman climbing off the bench to net a 112th-minute winner and get the trophy ball rolling for Mourinho at Stamford Bridge in his first season. Mourinho consoles Steven Gerrard after his own goal in the League Cup final of 2005 . The manager gestured with a finger to his lips on winning the competition in a bid to silence his critics . 2007 – League Cup (Chelsea 2-1 Arsenal) Didier Drogba was simply unplayable, scoring twice to beat Arsenal. The game was remembered for the significant blow John Terry took to the face thanks to the boot of Abou Diaby. Frank Lampard lifts the League Cup after Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium . John Terry had to be taken off on a stretcher after suffering a serious blow to the head from Abou Diaby . Drogba started his run of scoring important goals in finals against the Gunners in 2007 . 2007 – FA Cup (Chelsea 1-0 Manchester United AET) It was the year of Drogba, who completed Chelsea’s historic double with an extra-time winner against Manchester United at Wembley, poking underneath Edwin van der Sar. The Blues were slightly fortunate given Ryan Giggs had appeared to have scored earlier but referee Steve Bennett’s assistant adjudged that the ball had not crossed the line. Drogba wheels away after netting an extra-time winner against Manchester United at Wembley . Mourinho laughs with Ashley Cole (left) after lifting his first FA Cup as Chelsea manager . 2010 – Coppa Italia (Inter Milan 1-0 Roma) Success in Italy was largely down to the prolific season enjoyed by Diego Milito, whose only goal against Roma (in the Stadio Olimpico, by the way) sealed Mourinho’s first trophy at Inter. The first of three, including Serie A. Mourinho kisses the Coppa Italia trophy after Inter Milan beat Roma in their own back yard . 2010 – Champions League (Inter Milan 2-0 Bayern Munich) This was classic Mourinho. They absorbed a fair amount of pressure against Louis van Gaal’s Bayern, Milito taking both his chances when they arose and the rest is history. As with his exit from Porto, a teary Jose departed the club after a Champions League victory. Mourinho is surrounded by his players and staff after beating Bayern Munich in the Champions League . The in-form Diego Milito notched twice as Inter downed Louis van Gaal's side in 2010 . 2011 - Copa del Rey (Real Madrid 1-0 Barcelona AET) Now this was sweet. In his first season as manager of the biggest club in the world, Mourinho beat arch rivals Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final thanks to his fellow countryman Cristiano Ronaldo. Interestingly, it was yet another goal coming in extra-time to seal it. Mourinho was held aloft after Real Madrid beat Barcelona in the 2011 Copa del Rey final . Real Madrid players enjoyed a hero's welcome but dropped the trophy from their bus . 2013 – Copa del Rey (Real Madrid 1-2 Atletico Madrid) If 2011 was sweet, this defeat saw Mourinho plunge to the depths of despair. An extra-time defeat at the hands of their city rivals Atletico – after Ronaldo had put Real into a 14th-minute lead, no less. It was the beginning of the end for the boss, who left for his second Chelsea spell soon after.","Chelsea are through to the Capital One Cup final after beating Liverpool .

"It's a tragic life when all you live for is to hate Manchester United. There are some strange people around but I think the strangest of all must be those who can't wait for the weekend so that they can totally ignore the reality of what's actually happening, and instead work overtime to twist and fabricate anything Manchester United do into some sort of massive failure. These people belong to a special sect – ABU. Anyone But United. Louis van Gaal's Manchester United have three more points than they did under David Moyes last year . Moyes was sacked by United after one season  - Van Gaal's points tally was identical up to last week . The United haters have come out in force to laugh at the Premier League giants during their struggles . It's a world where you have no love for anything in particular, but you do thrive and flourish off an irrational hatred for Manchester United. It's a peculiarity of the insecure English nation that results in a dislike of anyone who does well for themselves. It also results in a display of an abnormal level of pleasure when those who achieve happiness or success fail or stumble. In the weird world of these people Louis van Gaal is no better at football management than David Moyes. I could end the column here and leave you to ponder on that for a moment, but contractual demands and a desire to hammer home the point will force my hand and compel me to continue. In case you're not aware, Van Gaal has won titles with every club he's managed (including a remarkable and unlikely success six years ago with AZ Alkmaar), he's won the Champions League and he's been to a World Cup semi-final. He's not the greatest coach the world has seen, but he isn't far off, and you don't have to have played the game to work out that his record stands up against that of Moyes. Then-Barcelona boss Van Gaal speaking with former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in 1998 . So, this debate has developed – are United better off under Van Gaal? Has he done better than Moyes did? 'He's only got the same number of points,' the United-haters cried last week, ahead of the QPR match - Van Gaal now has three more - before following up with the inevitable: 'And he's spent way more than Moyes did.' (Probably because Moyes didn't know who to sign, and even if he did those players didn't want to play for him). Points totals are irrelevant to United this season. Van Gaal will be judged solely, and rightly, on whether they finish in the top four. So even if United finish with fewer points than Moyes accumulated last season at Old Trafford, it will not matter at all, so long as they finish in the top four. It really is that simple. And so far Van Gaal's record stands up to Moyes' record: the Scotsman took United from first to seventh, Van Gaal has taken them from seventh to fourth. I've watched the film The Theory of Everything and I'm inspired by Stephen Hawking, so I may have some sort of subliminal advantage. But in truth I'm a proper maths duffer who scraped a B at O-level, yet even I can work out Van Gaal has improved things so far this season. Van Gaal pictured during the Champions League semi-final with Bayern Munich in 2010 . Van Gaal (high-fiving Robin van Persie) went to the World Cup and got to the semi-final with Holland last year . And yes he has spent a lot of money, but offset that against the fact that all of those new signings have been injured - often large parts of the season - and you'll see it's not been straightforward. Unless of course you sit in a room and play football on your computer all day (highly likely in the case of haters up and down the country – your mum will bring your tea up on a tray soon). Apparently on these games you can be manager of Eastleigh or Forest Green, you can put a £60million player straight in your line-up and take your team from the Conference to the Premier League title and even win the Champions League. I've never seen these games – I prefer the real thing. And I can reveal some shocking news to these keyboard clowns - 40 years of going to games has confirmed to me that real football doesn't work like it does on your monitors. The ABUs have found plenty of sticks to beat United with this season, so let's take a look at a few more and rip them to shreds. On Saturday it was the fans who apparently forced Van Gaal's hand as he changed tactics at QPR. He's changed tactics before during games, he will change them again I'm sure. James Wilson watches on as his shot goes past QPR goalkeeper Rob Green to make sure of the three points . The 19-year-old striker (left) came on as a second-half substitute to wrap up the 2-0 victory for the visitors . Wilson celebrates scoring United's second goal of the game to open his account for the season . It was the fans who apparently forced Van Gaal's hand as he changed tactics at QPR, or so they say . You must either be incredibly stupid, or passionately hate Manchester United if you think this experienced coach, who's navigated his way to three Champions League finals in his career, was lost for ideas until the away fans gave him some tips. Listening to pundits after the game you'd think United hadn't won on Saturday at Loftus Road. But they did. Rangers showed their normal fight, and heaped on the pressure at the end, but United won 2-0 at a ground where even the champions couldn't win this season. Credit where it's due? Not likely. This is Manchester United, they won't get any credit. And the one that has had the ABUs dribbling saliva from the corners of their mouths: Radamel Falcao. The Colombian is a United-hater's dream. He's costing a fortune. QPR's goalkeeper Green (left) rushes out to deny Falcao when the Colombian takes a shot at him . Karl Henry (left) and Clint Hill of QPR challenge Falcao during the first half at Loftus Road . He's on big wages for sure, but that's what a player like Falcao commands in the current market. It seems the Falcao critics are unaware of his existence before he arrived at United. He scored nine in 13 for Colombia in qualifying for the 2014 World Cup and I was gutted he wasn't there in Brazil. But his recovery from an anterior cruciate ligament injury has been long and slow. United took a chance on his fitness, but it was a reduced risk – they didn't have to hand out a four-year contract. Before the injury, Falcao was undoubtedly one of the finest players in the world. You must have been sleeping through his time at Atletico Madrid if you can't acknowledge that. A 100 per cent fit and sharp Falcao would surely be devastating in the Premier League. And yet ABUs are trying to convince us he's useless. Why? At Rangers his finishing was poor, but the quality of his runs passed by the eye of the uneducated (or wilfully blind). Falcao was on fire during the qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup for Colombia . Falcao smashes a shot towards the QPR goal for United but the striker could not get on the scoresheet . Here are just a couple of examples from the highlights alone: In the 13th minute, Falcao drops off his marker, Juan Mata finds him with a great pass and he's through on goal. Rob Green saves. Ten minutes into the second half and he sprints as United counter, finds acres of space on the edge of the box but Marouane Fellaini chooses the wrong pass and goes wide. When the ball comes in, Falcao has cleverly held his run, stays on side, heads on target, but Green saves. When Fellaini opens the scoring, Falcao is unmarked in the six-yard box. And in the last minute, Falcao has sprinted into the box, left Karl Henry for dead to find space, but James Wilson elects to shoot, his effort is saved but fortunately for the youngster the ball falls back at his feet and he fires home. The runs are there, but the finishing isn't. He's back to his best in his mind, and needs to follow it up in all aspects of his game. Van Gaal's record speaks for itself and it proves he can become a better coach for United than Moyes . Fellaini (left) scored during United's 2-0 win at QPR though you would never know judging by the punditry . 'The worst miss of the season' declared so many on Twitter (always the best place for educated and considered reflection on the day's football – by Saturday night this social media hate-spot has descended into a stream of four-letter words and musings on Celebrity Big Brother) after Falcao had seemingly swung his foot and missed the ball three yards out of Green's virtually empty net. I suppose if you choose to totally ignore the crucial intervention of Steven Caulker which deflected the ball out of Falcao's path at the last minute then it would be a terrible miss. But then why would you distort the facts and not report it properly? Probably because it's enjoyable for some to knock Manchester United when they have nothing better in their lives. I don't know if United will finish in the top four, but I do know they're not perfect, and they look a long way off a title challenge. But I'll give you some facts: Manchester United were great. They aren't great right now, but they will be great again. Some strange people will need to steel themselves for that painful moment in their lives. Van Gaal's United aren't great at the moment but they will come good in the Premier League once again . United find themselves fourth in the Premier League table ahead of Saturday's visit to QPR .","Manchester United have three more points under Louis van Gaal than they did under David Moyes  in the Premier League after 22 games .

"It is likely that Jordan Henderson will captain Liverpool when Steven Gerrard leaves at the end of this season. A tunnel tear-up with Diego Costa has been advanced as evidence of his new-found steel. ‘If he becomes captain he will carry it with great honour,’ said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. He is certainly much improved, yet Henderson is sorely lacking a quality that can never be taken for granted. He has three goals this season. Gerrard, in his comparative dotage, has nine. Henderson has just 16 goals in his entire Liverpool career, dating back to 2011. In that same period, Gerrard has 42. It is likely Jordan Henderson  will captain Liverpool when Steven Gerrard leaves at the end of this season . Henderson (right) and current Liverpool skipper Gerrard share a joke during Thursday's training session . Henderson captained Liverpool during the Reds' 0-0 draw with Bolton at Anfield in the FA Cup on Saturday . Henderson argued with Chelsea's Diego Costa at Anfield during Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final . Both are central midfielders, both regarded as leaders within the group. Yet time and again, Gerrard has used his position and influence to conjure a vital result for his club. Henderson is yet to prove he can do that. Saturday’s draw with Bolton Wanderers was another example. Gerrard was rested, Liverpool drew a blank. Nobody filled his shoes, certainly not Henderson. Let’s face it, Liverpool wouldn’t even have made it this far without Gerrard. Had Rodgers rested him against AFC Wimbledon, they would probably have fallen at the first. When Gerrard is on the pitch, one always feels Liverpool have a chance. Gerrard scored twice as Liverpool defeated Wimbledon in the third round of the FA Cup earlier this month . Anyone can have a row with Diego Costa. If we don’t hear about too many tunnel confrontations involving Gerrard it is probably because we are too busy celebrating his brilliance on the pitch, or one of his match-winning goals. Gerrard’s captaincy is about so much more than pulling on an armband. He leads by example, but also by deed.","Jordan Henderson captained Liverpool during Saturday's draw with Bolton .

"John Carver says he will not allow Newcastle's season to 'drift away' after being appointed head coach until the end of the season. Carver was handed the reins at St James' Park until the end of the season on Monday, starting with Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Hull. Eleventh-placed Newcastle have lost their last three games and failed to win in four as the 50-year-old former assistant manager seeks his first victory at the helm since succeeding Alan Pardew earlier this month. Newly-appointed Newcastle boss John Carver is determined to not let his side's season 'drift away' 'I'm delighted to have got the job until the end of the season,' Carver told nufc.co.uk. 'Everyone knows I love this club and my goals are simple - to finish as high as we can in the Premier League and get as many points as we can. 'Everybody on the outside is talking about our season petering away but I am not going to allow that to happen. Carver will be hoping he can pick up his first win at the helm when his side travel to Hull City on Saturday . 'Those who are saying that don't know me, don't know the people around me and don't know this group of players. 'We're much more professional than that. We can't afford to let the season drift away and I won't allow it to happen. 'I'm too demanding and I won't allow anyone to slacken off between now and the end of May.' Carver (left) and Peter Beardsley (right) with Callum Roberts (centre) after he signed his professional contract . Carver will work alongside Steve Stone and Dave Watson, the latter having stepped up from looking after the Magpies' Under-18 side, and says he plans to spend as much time on the training ground as he did when he was Pardew's assistant. 'I love being on the training pitch and the role of the head coach is to be hands-on out here,' Carver said. 'When you are a manager you have to manage the football club, but the role has changed and it gives me maximum time on the training ground, coaching the players. Alan Pardew (right) left the North-East club in December to become the new Crystal Palace manager . 'What I have done is given Steve (Stone) and Dave (Watson) more responsibility because they are very good at what they do, and it is important that you delegate to those who are talented. 'But when it comes to the meat of the session, it is my responsibility to prepare the team for the final 16 games. 'The players have been really positive and have responded. 'Even though we haven't won a game yet, I think we've played some nice stuff in spells. 'Ultimately though, it is about scoring goals and winning games so that needs to change. Top scorer Papiss Cisse could return for Newcastle after Senegal went out of the Africa Cup of Nations . 'We've done plenty of work on that on the training pitch and hopefully that little bit of luck we need will fall our way this weekend.' Carver's hopes of a first victory in charge could be boosted by the return of top scorer Papiss Cisse following Senegal's early exit from the Africa Nations Cup on Tuesday. Senegal's 2-0 defeat to Algeria saw them crash out at the group stage and nine-goal Cisse, who scored twice in a 2-2 home draw with Hull in September, could now be available for the trip to the KC Stadium.

"All three NFL games in London next season will have early afternoon kick-offs in the UK, meaning fans back in the US will have to get up early to watch.

"Outspoken Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman has kick-started the Super Bowl trash talk saying on that opposing quarterback Tom Brady isn't the clean-cut nice guy many believe him to be. Sherman and Brady clashed at the end of a 2012 regular season game, won 24-23 by the Seahawks, when the Seattle player ran over to Brady and yelled at him as he left the field.

Outspoken Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman has kick-started the Super Bowl trash talk . Sherman and Brady clashed at the end of a 2012 regular season game, won 24-23 by the Seahawks . Sherman finally offered an explanation on Wednesday for his response, which is sure to stir things up ahead of the February 1 Super Bowl. 'I think people somehow get a skewed view of Tom Brady that he is just a clean-cut does everything right and never says a bad word to anyone - and we know him to be otherwise,' Sherman told a press conference. 'In that moment of him being himself, he said some things and we returned the favour and unfortunately he apparently didn't remember what he said,' added Sherman. According to Sherman, Brady had been taunting the Seahawks defence throughout the game. 'He was pretty much saying that we were nobodies and that we should come up to him after they got the win. We should take that pretty well? Cool, can I get your autograph too?' said the 26-year-old Californian. According to Sherman, Brady had been taunting the Seahawks defence throughout the game .

But the cornerback says he expects to have no problems come game day. 'They think it will be better by game day. There shouldn't be any limitations honestly,' said Sherman. 'My left stiff-arm might not be the greatest right now but other than that, I'll be pretty decent.'

"Tom Brady firmly denied having any part in Deflategate or altering balls in a press conference. 'When I pick those footballs out, at that point, to me, they're perfect,' he said. 'I don't want anyone touching my balls after that. I don't want anyone rubbing them, you know, putting any air in them, taking any air out. To me, those balls are perfect and that's what I expect when I show up on the field.' And while he said he did not know of anyone on his team lowering the pressure in any of the game balls, he said while he could not deny that anything happened as he was busy preparing for the game and did not see everything that went on, he talked to the team's equipment staff who said they did not adjust the pressure in the balls. 'They also know how I like the balls and I tell them how great they are,' he said of the staff. Scroll down for videos . Tom Brady firmly denied having any involvement in Deflategate during a press conference . Bill Belichick  addressed the media  in reference to the recent Deflategate scandal that is plaguing the Patriots . 'I feel like I have always played within the rules. I would never break the rules,' Brady told the press . Meanwhile, teammates who spoke with NBC News said he told members of the New England Patriots in a closed door meeting earlier in the day that he liked his balls 'a certain way.' 'I feel like I have always played within the rules. I would never break the rules,' Brady told the press. 'I was as surprised as anybody when I heard Monday morning what was happening.' Brady also made it very clear that he believes the Patriots won 'fair and square' in their 45 - 7 rout of the Indianapolis Colts last Sunday in the AFC Championship game. Brady also stressed this was not as serious as everyone has been making it out to be these past few days, noting; 'This isn't ISIS, no one's dying, we'll get through this.' The NFL seems to feel the same way too, with Brady revealing investigators have not even reached out to him. Some members of the press were shocked however when Brady said he would not even be able to notice the difference in ball pressure while playing as he is only focused on the game. 'Everybody has a preference. Some guys like them round. Some guys like them thin. Some guys like them tacky. Some guys like them brand new. Some guys like old balls,' he explained. He also says he checks the leather, laces and tack of the ball before games, but never squeezes them. 'I think there’s a lot of people who have more information than me,' said the two-time Super Bowl MVP. 'I have questions, too.' He later said; 'The integrity of the sport is very important.' Brady hinted at his possible involvement in Deflategate as he told members of the New England Patriots in a closed door meeting that he liked his balls 'a certain way' Meanwhile, the eternally gruff and forever short Belichick addressed the media Thursday morning and kept it simple, saying he was 'shocked' to learn that 11 of his team's 12 balls were underinflated and that he never even touches game balls, let alone knows anything about 'football air pressure.' Belichick had told the media they should address comments they have about the footballs to Brady. 'I think we all know that quarterbacks, kickers, specialists have certain preferences on footballs. They know a lot more about it than I do. They're a lot more sensitive to it than I am,' he explained. 'I hear them comment on it from time to time, but I can tell you and they will tell you that there is never any sympathy whatsoever from me on that subject. Zero. Tom's personal preferences on his footballs is something he can talk about in much better detail and information than I can possibly provide.' He then added; 'In my entire coaching career, I have never talked to any player or staff member about football air pressure,' said Belichick. He also said he would be sure to keep the balls on the higher end of the inflation scale moving forward to make sure this does not happen again. 'Obviously, with our footballs being inflated to the 12.5-pound range, any deflation would then take us under that specification limit,' he said. 'Knowing that now, in the future, we will certainly inflate the footballs above that low level to account for any possible change during the game.' The conference ended, in typical Belichick style, with the coaching great giving the same response to every question asked by the press; 'I've told you everything I know.' If, for any reason, anyone on the Patriots is found to have anything to do with Sunday's under-inflated balls, they would face up to a $25,000 fine . This as Brady and Belichick prepare to face the Seattle Seahawks on February 1 in their record sixth Super Bowl appearance. The Seahawks, the reigning Super Bowl champions, have remained somewhat quiet about the recent controversy, though the team's cornerback Richard Sherman did say of Brady while speaking to the press on Wednesday; 'I think people somehow get a skewed view of Tom Brady that he is just a clean-cut does everything right and never says a bad word to anyone - and we know him to be otherwise.' Also making comments about brady was Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, who was far more complimentary than his teammate. 'He’s the greatest quarterback to ever play the game, one of the greatest at least,' said Wilson. 'I just think that he’s as good as it gets and watching him play the game of football is truly spectacular.' 'I think people somehow get a skewed view of Tom Brady that he is just a clean-cut does everything right and never says a bad word to anyone - and we know him to be otherwise,' said Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman (above with Brady after a 2012 game) 'He’s the greatest quarterback to ever play the game,' said Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson of Brady . If, for any reason, anyone on the Patriots is found to have anything to do with Sunday's underinflated balls, they would face up to a $25,000 fine. As for Belichick, the incident has many referencing his previous discipline from the league in 2007 when it was discovered that he had sent someone to record the defensive signals used by the New York Jets. It is worth nothing however, that while 11 of 12 balls were underinflated by two pounds, they were adjusted at halftime when the score was 17 - 7 in favor of the Patriots. With the balls in the acceptable range in the second half, the Patriots outscored the Colts 28 - 0 meaning that should anyone on the Patriots have been involved this would have ultimately proven to be a high risk situation with a very, very low reward. Then, there is what Martin Schmaltz, a Professor of Physics at Boston University, had to tell Boston.com about the possibility no one did anything to the balls and it was just simple physics. 'If they had inflated the balls inside the building and put it to the minimum amount, and then brought it outside to temperatures that were about 30 degrees lower, that would drop the PSI by between 1 and 2,' Schmaltz explained.","Bill Belichick addressed the Deflategate scandal and said he was 'shocked' to learn the team's balls were under-inflated on Sunday .

"The NFL has revealed that evidence so far suggests the New England Patriots used under-inflated balls in the first half of their AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts. An investigation is continuing into allegations the Patriots deliberately sabotaged the balls in their 45-7 victory at the Gillette Stadium on Sunday, which set up a Super Bowl showdown with the Seattle Seahawks in nine days' time. Yet one of sport's most prestigious events has been overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the Pats, for whom quarter-back Tom Brady launched an impassioned defence of his side on Thursday. The NFL released evidence that suggested the balls used in the AFC Championship Game were under-inflated . But the NFL, while admitting its probe was far from concluded, said that it, so far, appeared the balls used by the Pats in the opening half were below regulation pressure limits of between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch. The statement did not say whether that was intentional, though, and added that the balls used in the second half were 'properly inflated'. Deflating a ball can, but will not necessarily, make it easier to catch. The saga has been dubbed 'deflategate' on social media. The New England Patriots practice in Foxborough ahead of their Super Bowl showdown against Seattle . New England quarterback Tom Brady launched an impassionate defence of the Patriots . The NFL said in a statement on its official website: 'The investigation is ongoing, will be thorough and objective, and is being pursued expeditiously. In the coming days, we expect to conduct numerous additional interviews, examine video and other forensic evidence, as well as relevant physical evidence. 'While the evidence thus far supports the conclusion that footballs that were under-inflated were used by the Patriots in the first half, the footballs were properly inflated for the second half and confirmed at the conclusion of the game to have remained properly inflated. 'The goals of the investigation will be to determine the explanation for why footballs used in the game were not in compliance with the playing rules and specifically whether any non-compliance was the result of deliberate action. A Super Bowl advert is displayed in downtown Phoenix ahead of the game between Seattle and New England . 'We have not made any judgments on these points and will not do so until we have concluded our investigation and considered all of the relevant evidence.'

"The NFL says its investigation into whether the New England Patriots used under-inflated footballs in the AFC Championship game is ongoing after a report late on Tuesday claimed the league found 11 balls were not properly inflated. Troy Vincent, the NFL executive vice president for football operations, told The Associated Press the 'investigation is underway and we're still awaiting findings.' Vincent was responding to an ESPN report that cited anonymous league sources saying 11 of the Patriots' 12 allotted game footballs were under-inflated by 2 pounds per square inch of air. ESPN did not say how that occurred. VIDEO Scroll down to watch match highlights and reaction .

New England's Julian Edelman (right) runs with the ball against  D'Qwell Jackson during Sunday's match . Vincent said earlier Tuesday he expected the probe to be concluded by the end of the week. The last thing the NFL wants after a difficult season off the field is a potential cheating scandal that disrupts Super Bowl week. New England faces the Seattle Seahawks on Feb. 1 in Glendale, Arizona. The Patriots, who beat the Indianapolis Colts 45-7 for the AFC title, said they were cooperating with the league, and a Seahawks spokesman said the team would defer to the league on the matter. The NFL began looking into the issue not only because doctoring the footballs could provide a competitive advantage, but because it would compromise the integrity of the game. Deflating a football can change the way it's gripped by a player or the way it travels through the air. Under NFL rules, each team provides balls each game for use when its offense is on the field. The balls are inspected before the game by the officiating crew, then handled during the game by personnel provided by the home team. Social media responses were quick late Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning. It has been claimed that officials took a ball out of play during the AFC Championship game to weigh it . '11 of 12 balls under-inflated can anyone spell cheating!!! (hash)Just Saying' was the tweet from Hall of Fame receiver Jerry Rice. 'So we get to play the game again or nah? ??' tweeted Colts cornerback Darius Butler. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said on ESPN radio in Milwaukee that he didn't like how referees who inspected balls before games take air out of the game balls. 'I have a major problem with the way it goes down, to be honest with you,' Rodgers said. 'The majority of the time, they take air out of the football. That, for me, is a disadvantage.' 'My belief is that there should be a minimum air-pressure requirement but not a maximum,' Rodgers said. 'There's no advantage, in my opinion. We're not kicking the football. There's no advantage in having a pumped-up football. Patriot's player Nate Solder (right) surges towards the touchdown line against the Colts .

While the NFC championship was heavy with drama, there was no edge-of-your-seat excitement at rainy Gillette Stadium as the Patriots charged to a 14-0 first-quarter lead and never were threatened, giving coach Bill Belichick his 21st career play-off victory to break the record he shared with Tom Landry. Brady, who had already thrown more post-season touchdowns than any quarterback, added a hat-trick to his total, hitting James Develin, Nate Solder and favorite target Rob Gronkowski to bring his career tally to 50. 'We put a lot of work in this year, worked our tails off to get to this point, it's nice to close the deal,' said Brady. 'We've got one more to go.

Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, who led the NFL in touchdown passes this season with 40, could not manage any against a swarming New England defence. Luck, now 0-4 against the Patriots since he entered the league as the No 1 overall pick in the 2012 draft, completed just 12 of 33 passes for 126 yards and was picked off twice. Zurlon Tipton had Indianapolis's lone score on a one-yard run in the second quarter. 'It's a disappointing loss, nobody wants to end their season that way but we'll learn from this,' said Colts coach Chuck Pagano. 'We took another step forward in the right direction. 'We were playing good football, coming off a big win and we ran into a buzz saw. They beat us in every phase of the game.' For all their success, Brady and his bunch are still hungry having gone 10 years since their 2005 Super Bowl triumph, when New England won a third title in a four-year span.

"Manny Pacquiao says Floyd Mayweather has been set a deadline of the end of January to sign-off their $200million super-fight, but admitted he’s in the dark as to whether it will ever happen. The Filipino has already agreed terms for the most eagerly-awaited fight in boxing which has been penciled in for May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. But Mayweather has yet to commit to a bout that has been more than five years in the making. Floyd Mayweather (left) may finally face Manny Pacquiao in the ring in May 2015 . Pacquiao says he and his agent have agreed terms and are awaiting a signed contract from Mayweather . 'My promoter and I, we've already agreed to the terms and conditions of whatever he wants,' Pacquiao told the Los Angeles Times. 'We're just waiting on the signed contract from him. I don't have an idea [if it will happen]. 'We just want to make that fight happen - for the sake of the fans, for the sake of the millions of people around the world who are excited to see that fight. 'I just want to prove who's really No 1.

Pacquiao said he had a deadline of the end of this month for Mayweather to put pen to paper before he would move on to other targets, which could include Bolton's Amir Khan. As well as the date and venue, a drug testing programme is believed to have been agreed. The remaining issues include how to broadcast the show jointly on HBO and Showtime. The last time the networks agreed to do so was for Lennox Lewis vs Mike Tyson in 2002. Further doubt was cast on the fight taking place when talks between Miguel Cotto and Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez broke down. Mayweather could opt to instead face a rematch with Cotto, three years after convincingly outpointing the Puerto Rican.","Manny Pacquiao says Floyd Mayweather has been set a deadline of the end of January to sign-off their potential mega fight .

"Andrew Luck passed for two touchdowns to the lead the Indianapolis Colts to a 24-13 playoff win over the Denver Broncos to step out of the shadow of Peyton Manning on Sunday and into the AFC title game against the New England Patriots. Compared to Manning since the day the Colts selected him with the first pick in the 2012 NFL draft, Luck quieted the debate as he outdueled the five-time National Football League most valuable player in front of a stunned crowd at the Mile High City. Manning built a Hall of Fame career in Indianapolis, rewriting the quarterbacking record book and taking the Colts to a Super Bowl before moving onto Denver in 2012 when the Colts decided their future belonged with the young Luck. The Indianapolis Colts upset the Denver Broncos to advance to the AFC Championship Game . Luck proved on Sunday the move was right one, completing 27 passes for 265 yards including touchdowns to Dwayne Allen and Hakeem Nicks. Manning, trying to get his team back to the Super Bowl after they were humiliated last year by the Seattle Seahawks, tossed for one touchdown and walked off the field amid speculation about the 38-year-old's future. If there is one cloud hanging over Manning's brilliant career it is that despite all the individual honours and awards, his Hall of Fame resume includes just one Super Bowl win in three trips to the championship game. The Colts prevailed 24-13 over the Broncos at Mile High to set up a meeting with the New England Patriots . Hakeem Nicks scores one of three touchdowns for the Colts in their victory in Denver . The Broncos stormed out of the gate to the roaring approval of a capacity crowd at Sport Authority Field, Manning hitting Demaryius Thomas with one-yard strike to turn their opening possession into a 7-0 lead. But Indianapolis would answer with a pair of impressive drives, Daniel Herron diving over from the six to complete a 73- yard drive. The Colts then turned a Manning fumble near mid-field into another score with Luck finding Allen with a three- yard touchdown pass.

Connor Barth booted a 45-yard field goal before the end of the half to trim the Indianapolis lead to 14-10 but the Colts quickly regained control after the break as Luck connected with Nicks for a 15-yard touchdown on their first possession.

"Aaron Rodgers battled through pain barrier to rally the Green Bay Packers to a thrilling 26-21 play-off victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday and send them to the NFC Championship Game against Seattle Seahawks. Rodgers, despite struggling with a calf injury, threw two touchdown passes in a row as Green Bay fought back from a 21-13 third-quarter deficit. He passed for three touchdowns and 317 yards for the game. 'His performance in the second half was as good as it gets,' said Packers coach Mike McCarthy. 'What he has done in this stadium in the last two games with the conditions of his calf has been spectacular.' Aaron Rodgers helped the Green Bay Packers come from behind to beat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday . Rodgers threw two touchdown passes in a row in Green Bay's comeback despite playing with a calf injury . The Cowboys though were left fuming about a controversial incompletion ruling late in the fourth quarter where instead of being at the Packers one-yard line after a brilliant Dez Bryant leap for a Tony Romo pass, they were forced to give Green Bay the ball back on downs. Rodgers had struggled in the final two games of the regular season and the first signs that a two-week break had not allowed for a complete recovery of the calf came when the Packers took the lead on their first drive. Rodgers looked to run with the ball but hobbling slightly, he spotted Andrew Quarless in the end zone with a four-yard pass. Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant was left in tears when his catch in the fourth quarter was overturned . Bryant made a stunning grab as he leaped above Sam Shields before coming down just shy of the end zone . Bryant didn't have full control of the ball as he hit the ground and it was ruled an incomplete pass . 'I feel like with my normal mobility I would have been able to just run that in,' said Rodgers. 'The pain in my calf helped me make that decision very easily.' Dallas struck back quickly with a pass interference penalty giving the Cowboys the ball at the one-yard line and Romo found fullback Tyler Clutts for his first career score. The Cowboys scored again when Romo connected with Terrance Williams and the receiver raced into the end zone. The Packers reduced the deficit to a point thanks to field goals on either side of halftime from Mason Crosby. Richard Rodgers catches a touchdown pass for Green Bay during their win at Lambeau Field on Sunday . Rodgers is mobbed by Packers fans after his 'Lambeau leap' into the crowd following his touchdown . Packers wide receiver Davante Adams  celebrates a touchdown with Randall Cobb and Andrew Quarless . But with Rodgers lacking mobility, Dallas extended their advantage on a one-yard touchdown run from DeMarco Murray who had shown his electrifying speed with a 26-yard rush earlier in the drive. Curiously, as time went on, Rodgers began to move better and he looked like his usual self when he moved out of the pocket, connecting with Davante Adams for a 46-yard touchdown pass to pull within one point. When the Packers quarterback then found Richard Rodgers with a 13-yard go-ahead touchdown pass, the Lambeau Field crowd sensed victory. Dallas quarterback Tony Romo shakes hands with his Green Bay counterpart Rodgers after the game . Dallas, though, will lament that crucial fourth-quarter decision by officials when, on fourth and two, Bryant rose spectacularly to catch a 31-yard pass and move the Cowboys to the one-yard line. After a challenge flag from McCarthy, the officials ruled the pass incomplete, handing the ball back to the Packers on their 33-yard line and Green Bay never gave the ball back to close out the win. Now they face the toughest of tasks in Seattle, where they lost 36-16 to open in the regular season in September.","Green Bay Packers beat Dallas Cowboys 26-21 at Lambeau Field .

"Seventeen months have passed since Alexander Gustafsson gave Jon Jones the fright of his life in their light-heavyweight title clash in Toronto. In the intervening period, the champion has beaten Glover Teixeira, scrapped with Daniel Cormier in and outside the Octagon and tested positive for cocaine. But on Saturday night, Gustafsson finally has the chance to earn the rematch he so craves. Alexander Gustafsson (left) and Anthony Johnson square up after weighing in for their fight in Sweden . The fight will take place in front of 30,000 fans at the Tele2 Arena in Stockholm on Saturday night . Victory for Gustafsson will earn him another shot at champion Jon Jones who he pushed close in 2013 . The Swede takes on a resurgent Anthony Johnson in front of a staggering 30,000 fans in Stockholm having fought just once – a second-round stoppage win over Jimi Manuwa in London last March – since losing one of the greatest nights in UFC history. Gustafsson knows that victory will guarantee him a second shot at Jones after injury robbed him of that opportunity last September. Predictably, the 28-year-old has been reluctant to look beyond Johnson this week, saying simply: ‘I don't think much about Jon Jones at the moment. It's all about Anthony.’ And so it is. Johnson’s first spell with the UFC ended in a first-round submission defeat to Vitor Belfort three years ago. ‘When I got cut after fighting Vitor Belfort, I knew I had to get my act together,’ he says. 'Me and my trainer were flying back from Brazil and we had a couple of cups of wine and started talking about what we were going to do. ‘So far we've kept our word and things have been working out.’ Johnson has impressed since returning to the UFC last year, seen here beating Phil Davis in Baltimore . Johnson then beat Antonio Rogerio Nogueira to earn himself a shot at Swede Gustafsson . After years of struggling to make weight, Johnson returned at 205lb and dominated Phil Davis over three rounds before taking just 44 seconds to knock out Antonio Rogerio Nogueira last summer. ‘I didn't expect to be in this position,’ he admits. ‘I knew I would be somewhere but I didn't think I'd be where I am right now. 'Deep down inside I've always known I had the talent to be the best so being in this situation doesn't surprise me but I didn't think it would come so fast.' Not that Johnson’s return has been completely smooth, however. The 30-year-old was suspended last September following an accusation of domestic violence. It was later lifted following the dismissal of the civil case. And while he too could be just 25 minutes from a title shot, Johnson is focused only on the job at hand. ‘Everyone keeps talking about Jon Jones but I don't look that far ahead,’ he says. ‘Right now, I'm just focusing on Gus. Gustafsson has not fought since he stopped Jimi Manuwa in the second round in London last March . ‘Alex Gustafsson is a tough opponent. This is a pretty even match up I think though. Something crazy is going to happen that's for sure. Don't be surprised by anything you see on the night. ‘I'm calm, cool and relaxed. I'm feeling good. ‘With the calibre of athlete that Alex is, and the calibre of athlete that I am, you can expect a huge fight.’ Gustafsson, meanwhile, believes his speed will give him the edge and that fighting at the magnificent Tele2 Arena is a ‘dream’. ‘From not fighting Jon Jones to fighting Anthony Johnson in this venue that is huge is not bad and I can't complain,’ he adds. But whether he likes it or not, Jones will be the name on everyone’s lips come the final bell on Saturday.","Alexander Gustafsson has waited almost 18 months for Jon Jones rematch .

"Frank Warren has opened negotiations for Tyson Fury to challenge new world heavyweight champion sensation Deontay Wilder. If this agreement can be reached quickly, Warren might even be prepared to pay step-aside money to Fury's scheduled opponent Christian Hammer in their European title defence at the O2 Arena on February 28. Warren will probably seek to book either Wembley Stadium or the Millennium in Cardiff for what he calls 'the biggest and most exciting fight out there in the world today, apart from Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao'. VIDEO Tyson Fury: Press conferences with Denotay Wilder would be legendary . Frank Warren (right) has opened negotiations for Tyson Fury (left) to challenge Deontay Wilder . Warren might be prepared to pay step-aside money to Fury's scheduled opponent Christian Hammer . Warren will probably seek to book either Wembley Stadium or the Millennium in Cardiff for the potential bout . Warren has just revealed the long-running talks for Wladimir Klitschko to honour his mandatory defence against Fury for the other versions of the heavyweight crown still remain difficult. Fury himself said: 'The ideal for me would be to beat Hammer, take the majority of those belts off Klitschko and then meet Wilder to become the undisputed champion. But if Wilder says he will fight me next, I will take that rather than hang about waiting for Wladimir.' Warren believes that Wilder vs Fury would be an even bigger box office sensation than a fight with Klitschko. 'Deontay has brought the heavyweight division out of the doldrums, and back to life. Him against Tyson would be the most exciting event to promote for me, bar none. 'The plan is still to pin down Klitschko and not let him duck Tyson but Wilder would be huge. Him and Tyson lead the heavyweight renaissance in 2015.' Wilder wears a mask during his ring entrance on Saturday night as he prepared to face Bermane Stiverne . Tyson himself says he will fight Wilder (left) next rather than wait about for Wladimir Klitschko . Warren confirmed that he has begun talks with Wilder adviser Al Haymon's team, via transatlantic telephone and that 'it is very promising'. He adds: 'With the greatest respect to Christian Hammer, if Wilder were to confirm this week I would pay him off. In a way it's a compliment, because we would have to ask ourselves, why take the risk? 'Why do that before the biggest income, the biggest live gate from a biggest TV heavyweight fight that could possibly happen? It will fill any football ground.' Hammer sounded convinced when he said 'people in Germany think I am mad, travelling over here to fight Tyson but I believe I could beat him on points'. Fury says: 'I don't think anyone in this room thinks he can beat me any more than I could beat Usain Bolt in a 100metre sprint. But running is not heavyweight boxing in which one punch can cause a big upset.'

"Ryan Bader knows Phil Davis is just another road block on his journey to a title shot. The American is bidding for his fourth successive victory in the Octagon when he faces his countryman in front of 30,000 fans in Sweden on Saturday. And Bader, who has only ever lost at the highest level, is confident victory will set him up for his best year yet. Scroll down for video . Ryan Bader (left) and Phil Davis show respect as they prepare to fight in Sweden on Saturday . 'A win against Phil is definitely a step in the right direction,' he told Sportsmail. 'Where I currently stand in the division, for me to get a title shot I need to go through Phil and he is the only thing that I am thinking about right now. 'I'm healthy now and my hand feels great. I'm going out to get this win and that’s exactly what is going to happen. Phil is a great fighter and a win against him will keep my momentum going in 2015. 'I've never been to Sweden. I've been lucky to fight in some really cool places - Japan, Australia and Brazil to name a few - in front of some real great crowds. I'm excited to fight in front of the passionate fans of Sweden and to check out Stockholm. Bader's most recent victory was a five-round points win over Ovince Saint Preux . 'I appreciate the opportunity Joe Silva has given me. The fans in Sweden are amazing and I can't imagine how electric the stadium will be…. I'll be looking forward to feeding off of the crowd and putting on a good show for these fans. 'Phil's an amazing wrestler and he has done a great job in the division utilizing his wrestling. But wrestling is one of my strong points as well. There is a chance that our wrestling will negate each other, but I'm prepared for anything.' Bader outpointed Rafael Cavalcante and Ovince St. Preux last year but admitted it has taken a year for him to be injury free. 'My hands feel great for the first time in over a year,' he said. 'I broke my hand against [Anthony] Perosh in the first couple minutes of the fight and re-fractured it during camp for the OSP fight. So, I'm ready to stand with Phil, but I’ll be prepared for wherever this fight should go.' Davis, meanwhile, has won two of his last three fights, including victories over Lyoto Machida and Glover Teixeira. And he believes he is stronger than Bader across the board. Davis also enjoyed a good year with his victories including one over Glover Teixeria . 'It’s a big stage to get a big win on,' he said. 'It’s definitely special to fight with that many people in the arena but there’s no extra pressure, it’s just like any other fight. 'A win over Bader will build my current win streak, and put me further into that top 5 and that elite group of fighters and closer to the title. I hope that after this win I’ll be close to a title shot but Alex is next in line, but for sure my goal is to get a title shot. 'The fight will go anywhere I want it to go; I will dictate where it goes. If I want to get the takedown, I’ll get the takedown. I’m better than Ryan in all areas. 'I’m keen for a knockout in this fight, I never pick rounds, I just give it my all. I can tell you that it’s going to be one-sided. 'I improve between all my fights, I've definitely been working on my striking but I pride myself in being a tactician. I focus on winning the fight wherever I can.'","Ryan Bader and Phil Davis clash in Stockholm in front of 30,000 fans .

"It wasn't quite Oprah Winfrey vs Lance Armstrong, but in his first interview since news of his positive test for cocaine, UFC champion Jon Jones apologised for the 'embarrassing situation' and insisted he is not a drug addict. Jones failed a routine test on December 4, a month before he made an eighth successful defence of his light-heavyweight title against Daniel Cormier. The results of the test were released three days after his victory before Jones checked himself into rehab and was later fined $25,000 (£16,520) by the UFC. UFC light heavyweight champion spoke to Fox Sports 1 in his first interview since failing a drug test . Jon Jones tested positive for cocaine a month before he fought Daniel Cormier in Las Vegas . The 27-year-old spoke for the first time during a 13-minute interview with Fox Sports 1. 'I'm not here to make excuses for what happened,' he said. 'A coward would sit here and try to come up with an elaborate reason or try to blame something. I'm not going to blame my friends or pressure. 'I did it at a party; I messed up. It wasn't a mistake because I consciously did it.' Jones admitted it wasn't the first time he had dabbled in the drug. 'I've dibbed and dabbed in my fair share of partying, lets say,' he said. 'The drug was introduced to me in college. It's not my thing, I don't know what came over me. 'The whole situation has been really embarrassing. 'I had to explain to so many people that I'm not a cocaine addict and not even a frequent user. 'I got caught with my pants down.' Jones is the UFC's light-heavyweight champion and the promotion's pound-for-pound No 1 fighter . Jones admitted that the day of the test had been 'nerve-wracking' because he knew he was likely to fail the test. But having told nobody about his fears, and having heard nothing about it by the time he weighed in for his fight, thought it might not have been picked up. Jones was at home with his family in Alberqurque when UFC president Dana White called with the news. 'My mum was one of the first people I called,' he said. 'It went better than I thought it would, she was very supportive. She said she didn't care about my athletic career and being a celebrity, she cared about me. She asked how big an issue it was and I told her it wasn't a problem.' Jones then entered rehab but was criticised for appearing to stay for just 24 hours. 'Going to rehab was a collective decision between me and my business parters,' he explained. 'I did a 24-hour evaluation where I spoke to three doctors for about seven hours. We spoke about drugs and the role it played in my life. 'They came to the conclusion that I didn't need to be an in patient. 'They put me in an out patient house and I stayed there the next day with a bunch of addicts. Jones outpointed his rival Cormier earlier this month to make an eighth successful defence of his belt . 'The counsellor sat me down and said he believed I made a big mistake and that I didn't need to live here with us. 'They test me on a weekly basis and our counselling sessions will be once, twice, even three times a week. 'When I went to rehab I was willing to stay there as long as I needed to be.' Jones concluded the interview by insisting that he would learn from the experience. 'I'm not going to sit here and say I'll never have a drink again or enjoy life,' he said. 'I think there are a lot of people out there who can relate to me. 'The important thing is to learn that when we fall down to get back up and not beat yourself up about it. 'My message to my fans is that I'm really sorry for maybe betraying their belief and letting them down. 'I've let myself down, my family, my team, the UFC and my fans.'","UFC light heavyweight  champion Jon Jones failed a drug test in December .

"Floyd Mayweather Jnr has confirmed he is negotiating a fight with Manny Pacquiao, but has played down reports that a deal is close. Pacquiao claimed last week that he has agreed to fight his long-time rival on May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. But Mayweather insists there is a long way to go before the $200million mega-fight that has been more than five years in the making, finally takes place. Floyd Mayweather denies the fight with Manny Pacquiao is close to being agreed . Pacquiao claimed he and his agent had agreed terms and are awaiting a signed contract from Mayweather . In a phone call to DJ Whoo Kid’s 'The Whoolywood Shuffle' show, he said: 'What everyone's been saying is false. 'I've been saying this for a long time, Pacquiao has no say because he fights for Top Rank Promotions. 'He's not in a position to call the shots right now; he's not the A-side. I have Mayweather Promotions, it's my company. 'Do I want to fight Pacquiao? Absolutely. Are we negotiating? Absolutely. Has the fight been made? Not at all.

I don't want to point the finger at Pacquiao, it's not him, it's his promoter.' On Monday, Pacquiao admitted he would look for another opponent if Mayweather did not agree to fight him by the end of the month. And he took to Twitter shortly after Mayweather's interview to say: 'I can easily beat Floyd Mayweather, I believe that. 'If you really care about the fans, you will fight. If you care about yourself, you won't fight.' 'Everyone had me as a big underdog to Oscar De La Hoya too.

"Eighteen months ago, Conor McGregor arrived in Boston as a one-fight UFC novice. He left a bona fide star - albeit a limping one after the Dubliner tore his cruciate ligament in his knee during his victory over Max Holloway. On Sunday, he will clamber into the same Octagon against veteran German Dennis Siver, knowing he is just one win away from a title shot. Conor McGregor is back in Boston as he headlines a UFC show for the first time against Dennis Siver . McGregor works out at a media and fans session at the UFC gym in Boston, three days before the fight . McGregor has become known for his unique fighting style, here he demonstrates a kick . 'Now I'm on taxis and billboards and the sides of buses out here so that's one thing that's changed,' McGregor told Sportsmail. 'I'm getting noticed a lot more in America. The fan base here seems to be growing at a rapid pace. 'If I step back and look at the journey I've been on and I see how far I've come, I just enjoy it. 'In my imagination, I always had everything but now it's transforming into reality. It's becoming more difficult to figure out the difference between imagination and reality, they appear to be one and the same.' After almost a year on the sidelines, McGregor returned last summer  with successive first round stoppages of first Diego Brandao and then Dustin Poirier.

Everything has gone smoothly; I focus on what goes right and everything else will go right.' McGregor, 26, has been outspoken about his next opponent, particularly in regard to Siver's failed drug test last April for which he was slapped with a nine-month ban.' 'I could easily have sat out and waited for mid-summer and fought for the belt,' McGregor said. 'But as a man who loves competition, I asked for a fight. 'I am not the person who picks the opponent at the end of the day. He [Siver] was in the frame before the Dustin fight even took place. 'After that I was the No 1 contender, I did not have to compete again. McGregor has shown little respect to Siver (right) ahead of their main event clash at the TD Garden . 'They went down the line of the top featherweights, everyone else had been matched but Dennis hadn't. 'I do not think he deserves it but he got lucky.

But he was quickly into his stride in the fight, aiming an axe kick at Cormier’s head before following up with several swipes up top. Cormier was then taken down for the first time in his MMA career but recovered quickly only to be sent backwards by a straight left. Cormier responded with a sharp right hand but although he kept the pressure on Jones, the challenger struggled to overcome the 11 inch disparity in reach. Cormier did land an uppercut with 30 seconds remaining but it was the champion’s round. Jones also started the second session as the aggressor but Cormier’s high work rate began to pay off and he found a home for his right hand.

The third session, however, burst into life at the midway point when Cerrone connected with a vicious head kick and it was he who continued to be the aggressor.

Former UFC fighter Tyson Griffin posted two videos on Instagram showing the latest altercation as both camps traded barbs. At Friday's weigh-in, meanwhile, Cormier turned his back on Jones as they pair refused to face-off. They then traded final verbal insults at the fighters' meeting. Cormier, meanwhile, believes he has exposed Jones as two-faced ahead of their mouthwatering match-up. 'I respect him as a champion but I don't necessarily respect that he wears many faces,' he told Sportsmail. 'I think we need to see the real Jon Jones and we're starting to see that. 'When he's in public or on TV, he portrays a person he's not really all the time. Sometimes he can be rude to fans and with some of the things he's said to me off camera. 'When you wear that many hats, it starts to get confusing. 'His emotions towards me are real. If you're indifferent towards someone, it doesn't matter. If you feel like you're superior to that person, it doesn't matter. But when you have genuine dislike for someone it's hard to hide your emotions. Because he has real-life animosity towards me, his real feelings are starting to come through.' The rivalry has been brewing since 2010 when Jones approached Cormier backstage at UFC 121 as Cain Velasquez took on Brock Lesnar.

Jones (left) and Cormier also faced off during a press conference at the MGM Grand last August . 'I reached out to him and told him I'd beat him in a wrestling match, sarcastically,' Jones explained to Sportsmail. 'He got all bothered about it and when I walked away I felt very awkward; I felt like it told a joke that didn't go down very well. 'I thought it was over but a week later, on Twitter, him and another wrestler tagged me in a conversation in which they were both insulting me, saying that I sucked at wrestling. 'I realised the guys were serious and that not only did my joke not go down well but it became a reason for Daniel to have beef with me. I read the tweets and that's when I realised I didn't like him. A grown man couldn't take me being sarcastic and he twisted it up in his mind to have a reason to dislike me.' Cormier added: 'Hes easily the person I've felt the most animosity for, just because it's been festering for so long. 'It's been a number of things over the course of time Jon and I have interacted. It's not one situation that's made him have the feelings he has or me the feelings I have. It's a number of things that we've experienced that's made us get to this point. 'I didn't see him as a rival at the time. I knew who he was and I was a fan of him. I'd been watching him come up the UFC ranks. I didn't see him as a potential opponent until we started to interact with each other and I thought OK, at some point we're going to fight. 'Is that going to affect how I compete inside the Octagon? Not by any means. I'm going to fight like a professional and in the way I need to fight. But in terms of outside the Octagon, I've never had an opponent who has gotten to me that way Jon has.' Jones pumps up the crowd during an open workout at the MGM Grand on Wednesday . Cormier (right) shows off his ground skills by attempting to submit Dan Henderson in UFC 173 . And while Jones acknowledges Cormier's achievements to date, he believes he is dreaming if he thinks he can become a UFC champion. 'He's a dreamer,' he said. 'He has high hopes and goals but he hasn't been able to achieve these things. He had a dream to be a national champion but he lost in the final. He had a dream to be an Olympic champion and it didn't happen. Now he has the opportunity to be a UFC champion and I don't believe it's going to happen. He's a dreamer because he doesn't have the heart to pull it off. 'He talks so much because he's trying to make people and himself believe in him. He speaks a good game but when push comes to shove I don't think he has what it takes to be champion like me.' Jones has reigned as champion since 2011 and has made seven successful defences but Cormier is convinced he is the man to end that run. 'I match up well against him,' he said. 'There's no secret formula to beating him, I just feel style for style I match up pretty well against him. 'I think people will be surprised. Anytime a guy is as dominant as Jon has been, we tend to hold him in such high regard that we think he's unbeatable. But no-one is unbeatable. Cormier (top) wrestles with Luke Rockhold as he prepares for his shot at the light heavyweight title . Cormier raises his hands after taking Luke Rockhold during an open workout on Wednesday . 'If Jon Jones, after being as dominant as he's been, gets beat, people will think, ""wow, where has this guy come from?"", because regardless of how good you are, they don't expect you to be as good as him and be on the level he's dominated for so long.' A poll among a handful of UFC fighters earlier this week backed Cormier to shock the champion but Jones insists too much has been made of the challenger's wrestling ability. 'It's not a wrestling match,' he added. 'He is a great wrestler but he was magnificent back in 2004 and 2008 when he wrestled in the Olympics. It's been several years since he was at his wrestling peak and I'm going to show that. I'm going to show I can wrestle him. 'Yes he might be a little bit better of a wrestler than me at a wrestling tournament but it's not a wrestling tournament,. People are punching you and elbowing you and keeping you guessing. 'I've fought many wrestlers and I've been able to mesmerise them and not allow them to do what they thought they were going to do. I believe I'll do the same with Daniel. 'He has a lot of confidence and it seems so simple when you're coming up with a plan but when you're in there it's difference. My strategy changes mid fight and I'll do something he didn't prepare for and pick him apart. 'I'm proven against guys like him and I believe he'll be another victim.'","Jon Jones defends his UFC light heavyweight title against Daniel Cormier .

"With Tiger Woods and the Super Bowl both back in town, Brandt Snedeker feels as if he is at the centre of the sporting world as he prepares to compete in this week's Waste Management Phoenix Open. The PGA Tour event already boasts the noisiest hole in golf and the electricity is likely to be at an all-time high with record crowds expected at the TPC Scottsdale where former world No 1 Woods will be making his first start of the season. 'As a player, you do come here with more energy and there's always a lot more people here than at other PGA Tour events,' Snedeker said after playing in the pro-am competition on a sun-splashed Wednesday in the Arizona desert.

It's a lot of fun. 'You love being in the centre of the sports world for a little bit and that's kind of what we are this week. It's a great feeling, both as a golfer and as a fan.' Snedeker, a six-times winner on the PGA Tour who was FedExCup champion in 2012, has played in eight Phoenix Opens and has always relished the raucous atmosphere at the par-three 16th.

Thousands of spectators cram into the grandstands and sky boxes surrounding the 163-yard hole and they loudly boo any golfer who fails to hit the green off the tee. 'Sixteen has always been crazy and whether the Super Bowl is here or not, they (the fans) always get out pretty early... especially on a day like today when the weather is perfect,' Snedeker said. Woods, back at the Phoenix Open for the first time in 14 years, played two groups ahead of Snedeker in Wednesday's pro-am and by the time he reached the 16th hole, the bleachers and sky boxes were crammed full.

"Australia's former Open winner Kel Nagle died on Thursday, aged 94. Tributes began flowing in after the PGA of Australia released a statement saying Nagle had passed away at a Sydney hospital. 'It's a sad day for golf, we've lost a champion of our game,' said Brian Thorburn, chief executive officer of the PGA. Former Australia golfer Kel Nagle, pictured at the Open Championship in 1984, has died aged 94 . Nagle holds the Claret Jug after claiming victory at the Open Championship at St Andrews in 1960 . Nagle was one of Australia's most successful and popular golfers, winning 81 professional titles in his long career, including at least one every year between 1949 and 1975. His finest moment came in 1960 when he won the Centenary British Open at age 39, beating Arnold Palmer by a stroke at St Andrews. He also finished runner-up at the 1965 U.S. Open, beaten by Gary Player in an 18-hole playoff and was inducted into golf's Hall of Fame in 2007. 'Kel was a giant of the game - he had an incredible record with wins at the Open and Australian Open that make him a legend,' Golf Australia Chief Executive Stephen Pitt said. 'But much more than that, he was an ambassador for his sport and his country, universally liked and admired by his peers. 'His victory in the 1960 Open Championship was one of the most memorable by any major champion - the way he did that will never be forgotten.'

"The first of five tournaments for Tiger Woods this side of the Masters takes place in Phoenix this week, where the appearance of the 14-time Major champion provides a meaty sub-plot to the goings-on down the road at the Super Bowl. This will be Woods’s first showing in a regular PGA Tour event since last July, and first tournament anywhere since he finished joint last in the 18-man invitational tournament he hosted in Florida in December. So forget the missing tooth that sparked headlines last week. Here are five questions Woods must answer during these five events if he isn’t to go missing at Augusta. Fourteen-time Major winner Tiger Woods feels ready to start his season by playing two events in a row . For Woods to win another Major he must address if he is fit enough to challenge the likes of Rory McIlroy . Thanks to everyone who emailed their thoughts on our campaign to keep live coverage of The Open on free-to-air television. No one thought selling live coverage to Sky would be a smart move for the game. Peter Alliss tells me he’s been getting the same message, following our exclusive interview with the BBC’s voice of golf. One reader, Stuart Herd, summed up the mood. His daughter was good enough to win the Norfolk Ladies County Championship last year but they cannot afford Sky and so the only chance she gets to watch live golf is The Open and limited coverage of the Masters. Would she have taken up the game at all if she hadn’t had even these morsels for inspiration? Our amateur bodies do amazing work in unearthing major talents but you do fear they will soon be operating with both hands tied behind their backs, rather than one. Is he healthy? Woods is 39 and hasn’t a prayer of giving Rory McIlroy a run for his money unless he can offer a positive update on this one. An unquenchable work ethic was one of the things that gave him his edge and he needs to be able to put in the hard hours once more. Thankfully, there are reasons for cautious optimism. It’s got to be good news that he feels ready to start his season by playing two events in a row. Let’s hope he goes five events without once clutching his lower back or starting to limp. Can he find the fairway? While Tiger has been away, McIlroy has taken the art of driving to a new level. He’s consistently hitting the ball 350 yards down the middle. Over the past couple of years, Woods was hitting it 300 and crooked. Although his scorecards didn’t show it, Woods, armed with a more fluid swing, actually drove the ball quite well in that invitation event. Now we wait to see if he can locate enough fairways in PGA Tour events to compete. Despite showing a more fluid swing the 39-year-old must also compete with McIlroy's consistent driving . ‘I did not have a problem (with cocaine). I have issues. But that’s not the issue.’ American Dustin Johnson will presumably be suing all those publications who claimed his six-month break was due to a problem with recreational drugs. Curiously, none of the said outlets have placed their lawyers on high alert. Has he got the chipping yips? It was positively shocking to see Tiger, in his last outing, give a passable impersonation of a 24-handicapper at chipping. On six occasions he clunked the ball no more than a few feet in front of him. Logic suggests this will not happen once he gets back into the tournament routine, but it’s not a certainty. Previously, I’d have said Tiger could give up the game for a decade and still not duff six chips on his return. The Woods of old was a fearless and composed putter during the vital moments - but is that Tiger gone? Has there ever been a start to a year like this one? Normally January and February are mildly diverting. Now over the next month we’ll see two Ryder Cup captains chosen on either side of the Atlantic, world No 1 McIlroy cross-examined in a Dublin courtroom and, perhaps, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club ending 60 years of tradition and taking live coverage of The Open away from the BBC. That’s before the actual golf. Can he still putt under pressure? Nobody will convince me there was ever anyone to compare to Tiger when it came to holing vital putts. But it’s a sad truism that putting is always the first thing to go, and it’s a long time since we’ve seen him display the sort of fearlessness on the greens that used to be a given. Can he create some momentum? On each of the four occasions Tiger won the Masters he did it the same way — building up a head of steam and winning at least one event between January and March. Three of his five tournaments are at places where he has been a serial champion. He’s won two of them eight times and the other a mere seven. So while it’s not imperative he claims an 80th PGA Tour victory during these five events to have a chance at the Masters, he surely has to contend in at least a couple of them.","Tiger Woods is set to play his first regular PGA Tour event since last July .

"Lee Westwood has admitted he has grown tired of people calling him 'The Hoff' after the golfer rescued a drowning British tourist  last Friday. Westwood came to the aid of Colin Davies, a businessman from Solihull who suffers from Parkinson's disease, after he got into difficulty off the coast of Barbados.

The 41-year-old has revealed the jokes, that he initially found funny, are beginning to wind him up and even threatened to punch the next person to reference the actor. 'It was funny at first,' Westwood is quoted as saying in The Sun. 'Guys kept calling me ""The Hoff"" on the range and in the clubhouse. 'But I swear I'll take a swing at the next one to do it.'

"Lee Westwood begins his 22nd year as a professional at the Dubai Desert Classic on Thursday and he's relishing the prospect more than any other season in recent times. It's amazing what a win can do for a man, but it was also the manner of the Englishman's triumph in his last event in Thailand last month that has transformed his outlook. 'Most of my recent wins have come when I have been a few ahead in the final round, so it was nice to make up shots on the final day and do so by holing a lot of good putts,' he said. Lee Westwood picks the ball out of a hole on the practice green ahead of the Omega Dubai Desert Classic . Westwood watches an iron shot during a challenge match in aid of Breast Cancer Awareness in Dubai . 'I can't remember when I last felt that comfortable on the greens battling down the stretch. You'd have to go back years, but that's how you've got to feel if you're going to win tournaments. 'I remember when I was young I shot a lot of 63s and 64s to win and it's like a habit – once you start doing it, it becomes easier and easier. And it's a lovely feeling. Why it starts happening I don't know. There's no panic to your game, even if you miss a couple of putts or shots early on. You just remain calm, and things start to happen in your favour.' The belief started to return following his excellent performance at the Ryder Cup in September. 'If you're a captain's pick you're always under a bit more pressure, so it was nice to play well for Paul (McGinley) and return his faith,' said the 41 year old Englishman. 'So it had an influence. But, to be honest, I'd put in a lot of hard work before that, and I felt it was going to pay off.' Westwood emerged victorious at the Thailand Golf Championship in Chon Buri last month . Westwood (third from left) poses with stars including Henrik Stenson (L) and Darren Clarke (R) in Dubai . Westwood has put in the hours in the gym during the off-season and looks fitter than he has for some time. It certainly paid off last week while on holiday in Barbados, where he saved a man from drowning by carrying him out of the water. 'I only did what anyone would have done under the circumstances,' said the modest Westy, who was as surprised as anyone when the man he saved decided to put the story in the public domain. The man in question said he hoped the gods would shine on Westwood to the extent he would win three majors, but Westy himself would assuredly settle for one. 'That's the goal this year as always but I'm not going to put pressure on myself,' he said. 'I'll be going to enjoy them, and I like the venues this year. I've always done well in recent years at the Masters, and the US Open is being staged at a new course that is supposed to have tight fairways and small greens, so that will suit me. And I've finished runner-up in an Open at St Andrews, so yes, there's plenty of reasons for me to look forward to them.' Westwood admits he is feeling comfortable on the greens after suffering putting problems in recent years . The Englishman is hoping to win his first major as he begins his 22nd year as a professional . The one change this year will come as good news to his many admirers in these isles. Although he will continue to be based in Florida, Westwood will play more in Europe. As well as the PGA at Wentworth and The Open, he will add the Irish and French Opens, plus the European Masters in Switzerland. 'For a couple of years in America it has been nice to go easy on the travelling but I've missed not playing in those events,' he said. 'The Irish Open always has a special atmosphere and the French Open is held in a great spot in Versailles, while Crans in Switzerland is a spectacular place. So the ambition is still the same, and I want to get back in the world's top ten. I know my game is good enough and I don't see anything to scare me out there.' Sounds like the old Westy, doesn't he? With renewed confidence, it's going to be interesting to see how he gets on.","Lee Westwood will play in the Dubai Desert Classic this week .

"Bill Haas landed his sixth PGA Tour title after a tense finish to the Humana Challenge in La Quinta, California. The 32-year-old from Greenville, South Carolina, posted a closing five-under 67 for an aggregate 22-under 266, holding his place at the summit where he began the day in the company of three others. Rivals from further down the leaderboard scored lower over the final day on the PGA West Palmer course, with Charley Hoffman and Brendan Steele charging to a share of second place with rounds of 64. Bill Haas putts on the 18th hole as he secures his sixth PGA Tour win at the Humana Challenge . The 32-year-old Haas (left) walks down the fairway of the tenth hole with Erik Compton (right) But Haas went clear with a 20-foot birdie putt at the 16th, and stayed clear. He found the fringe of a fairway bunker with his drive at the par-five 18th, leaving the ball precariously placed on a ridge. It meant the five men one shot off the lead - Americans Hoffman, Steele, Matt Kuchar, and Steve Whitecroft, together with South Korean Sung Joon Park - were put on alert for a possible play-off. Haas, needing to make par, considered a host of unorthodox shots as he assessed the position of the ball, before settling for smartly punching out to make certain of a safe fairway lie for his third shot. From 175 yards, he put the ball 20 feet away from the flag. With two putts for the title, Haas sent the first to within two feet and coolly obliged with the tiddler to take the trophy and million-dollar pay cheque. Minutes earlier, Kuchar had missed an 11-foot birdie putt at the last to join Haas on 22 under, rolling the ball narrowly past. Matt Kuchar missed a putt of 11 feet for birdie that allowed Haas to extend his advantage . Haas managed to recover from a bad drive on 18 to make sure that victory was his . Haas, earning his first win since the AT&T National in June 2013, said on Sky Sports 4: 'I called my wife before the week started and said I didn't think I'd be able to score this week. 'On the last hole I was grinding it out to the end. Sixteen was huge. I needed that one to give me a chance. 'This is unbelievable. This is great.' The fright coming down 18 was one he was relieved to come through without any damage on his scorecard. 'I can't tell you what I was thinking,' Haas said of his wild tee shot. 'It was a bad drive. To end up there was pretty bad luck. It was a terrible break but maybe deservedly so with the bad shot.'","Bill Haas shot a five-under 67 to secure the Humana Challenge title .

"Tiger Woods was all smiles again as he prepared for his PGA Tour return as he spoke about the lost tooth he suffered while supporting skiing star girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. Woods is smiling again as he's now over his back injury, but he had some explaining to do after being pictured without a front tooth on what was meant to be a covert visit to celebrate Vonn's World Cup ski record. 'I had my mask on so no one knew who I was, trying to blend in, because there is not a lot of brown dudes at ski races, okay?' Woods said after a practice round at TPC Scottsdale.

"In this age of instant news perhaps the only two groups of people who still wait eagerly for the postman to arrive are star-crossed lovers on Valentine’s Day and professional golfers eagerly awaiting their official invitation to the Masters. For rising Englishman Danny Willett, the joyous confirmation of the latter came recently while halfway through a gym session at home. ‘I saw the postman coming down the yard, so I stopped the gym session and ran to the door because I had an inkling it was going to be the day,’ said the 27-year-old from Sheffield. ‘Obviously I knew I’d made it to Augusta by what I’d done at the end of last year but there’s still nothing like holding the official invitation. It just feels awesome to be setting out on a new season knowing you can plan your early year schedule around a trip to Augusta.’ Danny Willett with his trophy after winning the prestigious Nedbank Challenge in South Africa in December . Willett is sprayed with Champagne after his victory in South Africa earned him a place in the Masters . Willett booked his place with a victory in the prestigious Nedbank Challenge in South Africa in December that in turn got him into the all-important world top 50. He was the underdog going into the final round against a former world No 1 in Luke Donald but underlined his potential by outplaying his countryman with a nerveless display. Now, the hope is that after a few frustrating years when he has clearly been held back by a nagging back injury, he can lead the next wave of talented English golfers to the upper echelons of the game. ‘That’s certainly the goal,’ said Willett. ‘I’ve obviously gained a lot of confidence from what happened at the Nedbank. To play pretty flawless golf for the last 36 holes on a tight course was very satisfying. Englishman Danny Willett plays a shot during the final round of the Abu Dhabi Championship . ‘We seem to have a good new wave of English golfers and it’s funny how it seems to happen in cycles. You’ve got the likes of Luke and Westy (Lee Westwood), Justin Rose and Ian Poulter, who were all about the same age and now you’ve got the likes of myself and Tommy (Fleetwood), Sully [Andy Sullivan] and a few others. So hopefully I can be the leader. We’re all aiming high and let’s hope we can go on to match the last wave.’ Willett’s father is a Church of England vicar and he could be forgiven for being rather sick of the fact that every piece about him points out that he is the son of a preacher man. ‘No, I’m not fed up of it. He’s retiring in a couple of years anyway so you’ll all have to stop it then,’ said Willett, with a grin. Willett has been in fine form recently and has earned a place at the first Major of the season, the Masters . Rather than his dad, it was his two older brothers, who were both sports-mad, who got Willett into golf. ‘I had to find some sport that I could beat them in,’ he said. ‘It’s funny when golf gets its hooks into you. I would practice for hours on my own. It takes over your childhood.’ Willett goes into the Dubai Desert Classic this week as leader of the Race to Dubai, and hoping his status will get him invitations to regular PGA Tour events ahead of the Masters. ‘It might mean a last-minute dash to tournaments but that’s not a bad problem to have,’ he said. ‘Sheffield or Los Angeles in February. . . that’s a toughie, isn’t it?’ In Dubai last year, Willett fulfilled a long-held dream to do a bit of sky-diving. Now, having recently got married and with a prized Masters invitation on the mantelpiece, he is looking up.","Won the prestigious Nedbank Challenge in South Africa in December .

"Martin Kaymer has vowed to follow in Rory McIlroy’s footsteps and use a bitter experience as added motivation after suffering the worst collapse in golf history at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship. Nine days on from that stunning loss, when he threw away a ten shot lead with 13 holes to play, the German admits he has been doing plenty of soul-searching. ‘It wasn’t just a big golf lesson it was a huge life lesson,’ he said. ‘It was like what happened to Rory a few years ago at the Masters. When he lost that back nine lead (in 2011) it was shocking and sad to see and it’s tough to handle those situations. 'But if you deal with it honestly and gain more motivation then you can do what he did and come out a few months later and win the US Open by 20 shots or whatever. VIDEO Scroll down for Martin Kaymer and Henrik Stenson look ahead to Dubai . Martin Kaymer surrendered a 10-shot final-round lead at the Abu Dhabi Championship . Kaymer admitted that he was doing so well he became complacent and capitulated . ‘I’ve been having some hard conversations with my dad and my brother in private and I do believe what happened will help me improve in the future. So I am very glad I went through it. If I had won in Abu Dhabi again (for a fourth time) everybody would have joked: ""Oh yeah, why don’t they rename the place the Martin Kaymer golf course and all those sort of things.” ‘And yeah it would have been good to gain a few more world ranking points and another beautiful trophy in my house. But what happened instead – that will be better for me.’ US Open champion Kaymer was in good spirits here on Tuesday as he looked forward to the Dubai Desert Classic on Thursday, where a star-studded field also includes the likes of the world numbers one and two, McIlroy and Henrik Stenson, plus Sergio Garcia and Graeme McDowell. But the German star said he hopes to use the experience as motivation for future performances . Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy experienced something similar at the Masters in 2011 . ‘I think Abu Dhabi just shows you that German engineering doesn’t always work,’ he said, smiling. ‘It does usually, but one in a while it comes unstuck.’ Kaymer admitted that over-confidence played its part in his downfall. ‘I think when you start off a final round with a big lead and then you begin birdie, birdie, par, birdie, you almost feel like not much can go wrong,’ he said. ‘And in golf, that little bit of too much confidence can hurt and it’s a very fine line. ‘How I felt that day is not the person I am and not the person I want to be. It did not feel natural to me and it becomes very difficult because it is an unknown situation, and one you don’t want to be in. ‘Afterwards I asked myself how did I get into it and why did I get into it. And all those answers I got, they will prove important to me going forward.’ McIlroy was leading until the final round, he has experienced considerable success in the years after .","Martin Kaymer was 10 shots clear on the final round in Abu Dhabi .

"Branden Grace made a decisive eagle on the 16th to win the Qatar Masters on Saturday by one stroke and clinch his sixth European Tour title. The South African shot a final round 6-under 66 for an overall 19-under 269 to hold off runner-up Marc Warren (67) of Scotland. Bernd Wiesberger's two bogeys on the second and third holes proved costly as the Austrian settled for third place at 17 under. South Africa's Branden Grace lifts the trophy after coming out on top at the Qatar Masters . Grace held his nerve on the 18th hole to produce a birdie that brought him a second title this season . Grace celebrates after sinking his final putt at the 18th hole for a round of 66 . Grace's eagle came after he drove to five feet on the par-four No. 16 and then finished with his fourth birdie on the last hole. ""It was a great day, a great week, and it's another trophy to put in the cupboard,"" said Grace. ""The form has been there, I played great and I managed to get in on top."" On Friday Grace hit a superb snap-hook wedge from the trees on the fifth which resulted in a birdie and set up a third-round 68 after a struggling start. Grace has now won all six European Tour events which he has been leading or sharing the lead going into the final round. It was his second victory of the 2015 Race to Dubai after winning the Alfred Dunhill Championship at home. Going into the final round, Grace and Warren were tied for the lead with Emiliano Grillo of Argentina and Wiesberger. But France's Gregory Bourdy mounted the challenge by firing in six birdies on the first nine holes before he slipped with a bogey on the 15th for a 7-under 65. Korea's Byeong-Hun An shot 65 but missed a crucial birdie on the last hole to miss out. Scotland's Marc Warren recovered from a double bogey with six birdies but fell just short in Doha . Warren started well with birdies from 10 and 15 feet respectively on the first two holes, but double bogeyed at the eighth when his tee shot landed in water. Warren recovered through birdies at Nos. 9 and 10 as Grace went 10 holes without a birdie before finding one at the 12th from 10 feet. Even after Grace's eagle on the 16th, Warren found a birdie on the same hole. Warren tied the scores again with another brilliant tee shot on the par-3 17th for a birdie, but couldn't match Grace's birdie at the last hole.

"The Open at men-only Muirfield in 2013 was perhaps the most bruising week in the history of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. 'Never again' became the mantra after the event was overshadowed by political and media condemnation of the club's exclusionary membership policy. Accordingly, the R&A put their own house in order, sweeping away more than 250 years of tradition with a vote last year that will see the club accept its first women members. That intent to avoid another Muirfield surely lies behind Tuesday's announcement that men-only Royal Troon, who will host next year's Open, are undertaking a 'comprehensive' review of their membership policy. They also agreed to share responsibility for hosting the event with Troon Ladies. Royal Troon Golf Club will undertake a 'comprehensive review' of its male only membership policy . Of the three men-only clubs on the Open rota — Royal St George's in Kent is the other — Troon had been the most aloof following the R&A vote. They hid behind the line that members of a separate club, Troon Ladies, can play the Open layout. 'We are a single-gender club but feel it is unfair to be compared to some other clubs,' said secretary David Brown. Then Scottish girls champion and Troon ladies member Connie Jaffrey revealed she was not even allowed to use the practice putting green. Imagine that being regurgitated during The Open? Hence the Troon press release announcing the review. Muirfield and Royal St George's are not due to host again until the 2020s but both are also undertaking reviews. American Todd Hamilton won his only major Championship when Royal Troon last hosted The Open in 2004 .

"Former world No 1 Luke Donald and five-time major winner Phil Mickelson both struggled in the first round of the Humana Challenge in La Quinta, California. Englishman Donald found himself 12 shots off the lead in the PGA Tour event following a three-over-par 75 that put him in a share of 145th place, while Mickelson was four shots better off but still no better than tied for 89th. Mickelson reached the turn in three under but his scoring fell away over the back nine as he signed for a one-under 71, while Donald began on the 10th tee and followed a double bogey at the par-four 18th with further dropped shots at the first and fifth before making an overdue birdie at the eighth. Michael Putnam plays his second shot on the 18th on his way to a first round 63 at the Humana Challenge . Luke Donald plays his approach to the 15th green during a disappointing opening round of 75 at La Quinta . Phil Mickelson plays a bunker shot on the fourth hole as he tied for 89th after day one in California . At a tournament that features three courses, Mickelson was playing at the La Quinta Country Club, with Donald off his best game on the PGA West Nicklaus. The other course is PGA West Palmer. All players will play a round on each during the first three days. The cut will then be made after 54 holes with the top 70 and ties playing the final round on the Palmer course. Mickelson said of his round: 'I got off to a pretty good start, and then I just stalled. I'm excited about the year, excited about playing, and even though this is the worst score I've had in a long time, I'm excited about getting back out tomorrow. I can't wait to get started again because I feel like I played a little tight today, kind of steered it a little bit.' The 44-year-old American added on the PGA Tour website: 'Hopefully the way I'm playing will show in the score, but today it just didn't.'

Putnam said: 'The focus for me is on the Palmer tomorrow and then La Quinta on Saturday. There's a lot of birdies going to be made in 54 holes by a lot of guys. So I have to make a lot of birdies.' Putnam was being closely pursued, with five players on eight under.

"Scotland's Marc Warren was one of four players to claim a share of the lead heading into the final day of the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters. Warren shot a five-under-par third-round 67 in Doha to join Branden Grace, Emiliano Grillo and Bernd Wiesberger at the top of the leaderboard on 13 under. England's Eddie Pepperell was among the chasing pack after shooting a superb 65 to finish the day on 11 under alongside Alejandro Canizares and George Coetzee. Marc Warren of Scotland fired a third-round 67 to take a share of the lead on Doha . Warren, who only bogeyed the 14th hole, admitted it had been a 'really pleasing day' Another Englishman, Oliver Fisher, was alone in eighth on nine under after carding 69. Warren's only blemish came as he missed a short putt to bogey the 14th but he responded with back-to-back birdies at the 15th and 16th to maintain high hopes of a fourth European Tour win. Warren told Sky Sports: 'It was good, really solid today. I missed a few greens on the back nine but my short game held it together, with a few good iron shots coming in. Overall it was a really pleasing day.' Bernd Wiesberger of Austria was also top of the leaderboard at the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters . Emiliano Grillo and Brandon Grace were the two other players to go into the final day on top . Grace bogeyed the third and fourth and hit further trouble when his tee shot at the fifth found the trees. But the South African somehow produced a superb recovery, despite not having clear sight of the green, to set up a birdie chance and provide the spark for a round of 68. Austrian Wiesberger had a steady day and birdied the 18th to record a 68 after a visit to the rocky rough had seen him drop his only shot at 16. Grillo, of Argentina, shot a bogey-free 67. Coetzee had a share of the lead after two rounds but fell back despite not dropping a shot in his 70. Canizares has not made a bogey in three days and maintained his progress with four birdies in his 68. Englishman Eddie Pepperell scored a superb 65 to give himself a fighting chance in the final round . But the round of the day belonged to Oxfordshire's Pepperell. A day after his 24th birthday, Pepperell sank nine birdies and held the clubhouse lead as he signed for his seven-under-par round. He was particularly impressive on the back nine, coming home in 31 with six birdies. He finished superbly by holing long putts on each of the last three greens. He said: 'I hit the ball well - better than I had the first two days - but I also putted better. I holed a number of good-length putts - 16, 17 and 18, they were all putts over 15 feet and nice ones to hole.' The day was not a memorable one for defending champion Sergio Garcia, however. The Spaniard slipped right out of contention by dropping eight shots in a dreadful back nine, including a triple-bogey seven at the par-four 15th. His 77 left him 12 shots off the lead.","Marc Warren is joint leader after third round of the event in Doha .

Serena had to save set points in her second round match and lost the opening set in rounds three and four, but made no such mistake against 2014 finalist Dominika Cibulkova on Rod Laver Arena.

"Andy Murray produced a classic display of hard-nosed and controlled tennis to set up a version of Friends Reunited in the semi-finals of the Australian Open. The 27-year-old Scot defused the power of Australian tyro Nick Kyrgios to come through 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 to clear the path to a fascinating contest against Tomas Berdych, now coached by Murray's long-time friend and chief lieutenant Dani Vallverdu. Murray was like an expert football team playing away from home – soaking up the pressure and coming with a solid, skilfull, tactical game to defy the home crowd and get the right result.

Berdych earlier defeated Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-0, 7-6, and will be full of confidence after not dropping a set in his five matches here. But then so should Murray, after coming through a much-hyped contest against the 19-year-old Australian whose time looks sure to come. This was an awkward assignment for him against someone with partisan backing from the 15,000 crowd, although the Scot will have felt at home in temperatures somewhat reminiscent of Dunblane. He gave a masterclass in difficult conditions on how to pick apart an opponent, who should have learned plenty from it. Murray has come into a rich vein of form this early in the season at a tournament where he has reached the semi-final or better five times now. 'It was a tricky match and very windy, I tried to start as quickly as possible because I know how dangerous Nick can be and what he is capable of,' said Murray. 'He is a huge hitter and so I tried to keep it out of his strike zone. 'It's understandable that he had great support, to play in front of a packed crowd like this was a privilege.'

He said: 'It's going to be a tough match, he is a big hitter and so far he has played extremely well this tournament.' The world No 6 had been phlegmatic under pressure, with his serve the bedrock of an excellent performance, winning two thirds of the points on his second delivery. He also teased Kyrgios with a tantalising mixture of angles, slices and pace, so often giving him the kind of ball he did not want to hit. Such was his consistency that the teenager never really got momentum going. Murray took the opener in 32 minutes and might have ended the second sooner than he did, although Kyrgios's booming serve was coming into its own. In the tiebreak Murray hit two exquisite lobs to turn it his way, the second of them clnching the set. Kyrgios again came back at him from 2-4 down in the third, gaining his one break of serve, but Murray's response was exemplary and he skilfully conunter attacked at the end.

"Rafael Nadal refused to make any excuses after his record-equalling winning streak over Tomas Berdych came to a comprehensive end in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open on Tuesday. Berdych won three of his first four meetings with Nadal but had not tasted victory over the Spaniard since 2006, his 17 straight defeats equalling a record in the open era. However, the 29-year-old Czech picked the ideal time to end the sequence with a stunning 6-2, 6-0, 7-6 (7/5) victory on Rod Laver Arena and has yet to drop a set in the championship. VIDEO Scroll down Australian Open: Tomas Berdych beats Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-0, 7-6 . Tomas Berdych celebrates his straight-sets win over Rafael Nadal at the Australian Open . Radal Nadal was shocked by Berdych as he was beaten in straight sets in the quarter-finals . It was just the third time Nadal had lost a set 6-0 in a grand slam, the most recent being to Roger Federer in the 2006 Wimbledon final and the other in the second round of the 2004 US Open against Andy Roddick. The nine-time French Open champion also lost a set 6-0 to Britain's Andy Murray in an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi earlier this month and had constantly maintained he was not a top contender in Melbourne due to the wrist injury and appendicitis which ruined the latter half of 2014. 'I am feeling okay. Just was not my day,' said Nadal, whose sole Australian Open title to date came back in 2009. 'I didn't play with the right intensity, with the right rhythm, and the opponent played better than me. 'It is a day that I just can congratulate my opponent. It is obvious that I needed something more to be more competitive, as I did in the third set. 'The third was the right set, the right game that I have to play. 'But is obvious that before I didn't play with the right confidence, with the right intensity, losing court (position), playing very short. I make him play very easy. 'So you cannot expect to win matches in quarter-finals of a grand slam helping the opponent to play well. The 28-year-old did threaten a comeback during the third set - but Berdych held on . Despite taking the third set to a tiebreak, Nadal was unable to force his way back into the match . 'Since the beginning of the third, I played with more character, more the way that I have to play to have chances to be where I want to be, to be where I have been for the last lot of years. 'As I said when I arrived here, the process always is not easy. When you have injuries, the comebacks are difficult. 'There are so many examples around the world of sport that have been tough to be back. I'm not an exception on that, no? 'I have to take the positive things. Without being at my top level of tennis I was able to be here in quarter-finals. 'Is not a bad result at all for me arriving here the way I arrived, only with five matches in seven months.' Berdych broke Nadal twice in the first set and three times in the second, barely being troubled on his serve until having to save two break points in the ninth game of the third set. Nadal then saved two match points to force a tiebreak and another at 6-4 in the breaker, but netted a return on the fourth match point after Berdych had set it up with a superb forehand return winner. Berdych was in complete control for the vast majority of the match as he reached the last four . 'I was definitely ready for it, I set up my plan pretty well and stuck with that all the way through the three sets,' a delighted Berdych said. 'I was expecting a very tough battle but I was ready for everything and I think that was the biggest difference. 'I started pretty well but you are playing Rafa and you have to really keep going until the last point. You have to be ready for everything. 'He is a great fighter but I stayed focused and kept doing my stuff and it was working pretty good.' Berdych praised the influence of new coach Dani Vallverdu, who previously helped Murray win grand slam titles at the US Open and Wimbledon. 'I've been really happy with how we work together so far but the good thing is I am already able to execute the things on the court,' Berdych added. 'It works well. We set up a great plan for today and it worked, so what could be better?' Asked what Vallverdu had come up with, Berdych replied: 'I think I'm going to keep it a bit secret. 'That would be really pointless setting up the tactics and the way how we want to prepare for the matches if I just open up everything here. 'But he changed a lot of things. He changed a lot of positive things.'","Rafael Nadal was knocked out of the Australian Open by Tomas Berdych .

"Fascino Rustico booked his ticket for the Betfair Hurdle on Saturday week with an easy victory at Newcastle in the Robert Kirkland Blyth Ltd Novices' Hurdle on Wednesday . Sent off the 11-8 second-favourite against John Ferguson's Zip Top, a former classy Flat horse and a good winner last time out, he was well in command at the finish. Always highly regarded, the John Hales-owned seven-year-old is now with trainer Dan Skelton having been with Paul Nicholls. Fascino Rustico (right) won the Novices' Hurdle in Newcastle on Wednesday . While the market leader made several mistakes at his hurdles, Fascino Rustico jumped with aplomb under Harry Skelton and came away after the last to beat the favourite by nine lengths. Betfred cut the winner to 12-1 from 16s for the valuable Newbury race. 'He'll go to Newbury now,' said Skelton. He was fine immediately after the race and as long as he's good for the next week or so he'll run. 'The 5lb penalty he'll get for winning we needed actually as I don't think he'd have got in the race otherwise. 'He's take time to mature but Paul always thought a fair bit of him. 'Paul was unlucky not to win with him but it meant he was still a novice for us. 'I'm just very lucky to get a horse as good as him and I'm very grateful to John for sending him to me. 'He has plenty of size and scope but I'm in no rush to send him chasing.' Dan Skelton is now the trainer of the highly rated Fascino Rustico . The rest of the card was dominated by a resurgent Donald McCain, who saddled a treble. Beeves (3-1) was first to strike in the Complete Building Services Handicap Chase in a slow-motion finish, holding off Little Glenshee. Stable jockey Jason Maguire was delayed, though, meaning Wilson Renwick took the mount. Maguire arrived in time to partner Up And Go (15-8 favourite) in the North Sea Logistics Novices' Handicap Chase. Once a promising type, and the conqueror of Many Clouds over hurdles, this was at least a step back in the right direction. Lovely Job (9-1) was a game winner of the M&C Roofing Maiden Hurdle for McCain and Maguire, just holding off Glinockie. Paul Nicholls (right) used to be Fascino Rustico's trainer . The duo were also represented by the favourite Mahler Lad in the closing bumper who had beaten a couple of subsequent Willie Mullins bumper winner in his only point-to-point but was struggling some way out before staying on for third. Impressive winner Captain Chaos (4-1) represented Tim Fitzgerald and Andrew Tinkler. It was also a day 10lb claimer Ryan Nichol will never forget as he rode his first winner on Lucinda Russell's Amore Mio (4-1) in the J Barbour & Sons Conditional Jockeys' Training Series Handicap Hurdle.","Fascino Rustico books Betfair Hurdle spot with Novices Hurdle victory .

"Peter Scudamore believes it is no forgone conclusion that Ruby Walsh will abandon Hurricane Fly to ride Willie Mullins-trained stablemate and favourite Faugheen in the Champion Hurdle on March 10. Most bookmakers and pundits expect Walsh to pick the unbeaten younger horse despite Hurricane Fly, a dual Champion Hurdler, landing an historic fifth Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown on Sunday to take his Grade-One race tally to 22. Eight-time champion jockey Scudamore said: ‘With a horse as good as Hurricane Fly, it will be a tough decision. Ruby Walsh rides Hurricane Fly alongside trainer Willie Mullins (right)  at Leopardstown on Sunday . Walsh has been tipped to abandon Hurricane Fly at Cheltenham for the younger unbeaten horse Faugheen . ‘Even for a hard-nosed sportsman, sentiment does come into it. It has to be there. In the past, Ruby stuck with Kauto Star when he could have ridden Denman. ‘Ground is also big factor. Hurricane Fly wants it soft and, with Cheltenham is as early in the year as it can be, there could be a chance the ground will be softer. That could swing the decision towards Hurricane Fly. ‘Faugheen still has to prove himself at the highest level over two miles. On his bare form, including his win in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton, he is too short a price for what he has achieved.’ Walsh, successful 17 times on Hurricane Fly, has partnered the 11-year-old in his last 18 races, a sequence stretching back to his 2011 Champion Hurdle win. Coral, who have Faugheen as Evens favourite for the Champion Hurdle, yesterday trimmed Hurricane Fly’s odds to 8-1.

"Oliver Sherwood believes the confidence instilled in Many Clouds when winning the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury in November has made his gelding a genuine Cheltenham Gold Cup contender. The Lambourn trainer’s assertion will be tested at the track on Saturday when the Trevor Hemmings-owned eight-year-old lines up in the Betbright Cup Chase against a line-up which includes last month’s King George VI Chase runner-up Dynaste plus solid marker The Giant Bolster, winner of the race 12 months ago and placed in the last three Gold Cups. Victory for Many Clouds would carry Sherwood to the brink of a notable landmark. He needs only two more successes to reach 1,000 career wins. Many Clouds (left) sprints clear to win The Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury back in November . But he would probably swap plenty of them to get his hands on the most prestigious prize in steeplechasing. Sherwood said: ‘My instinct is he is good enough. He used to make the odd jumping mistake as a novice but he is confident now. His schooling has been electric. His work is more confident. He is cocky – he thinks he is King Kong. ‘The proof of the pudding is on the racecourse but my gut feeling is that he has improved again. ‘Confidence is a huge thing in horses as well as humans. He knew he won the Hennessy. I am a huge believer in building a horse up gradually. You can aim too high too quickly and ruin a horse’s confidence. Going slowly can pay dividends.’ That policy has paid off for Sherwood with a gelding, who only cost £4,500 (6,000 euros). He ran in the 2012 Festival Bumper won by Champagne Fever, finishing ninth but on the heels of reigning Champion Hurdler Jezki and his big British rival for that crown, The New One. Sherwood steered Many Clouds away from the Cheltenham Festival the following season before a return last March ended when he and regular jockey Leighton Aspell were brought down in the RSA Chase won by O’Faolains Boy. Oliver Sherwood believes Many Clouds is therefore a contender for this year's Cheltenham Gold Cup . However, this particular cloud had a definite silver lining. Sherwood said: ‘The winner had beaten him Many Clouds in the Reynoldstown Chase but we were giving him 4lb so we had to be knocking on the door. ‘I was gutted but then a week later I thought it might be a blessing in disguise because had he won or been second he would not have been weighted to win a Hennessy.’ If confidence is sky-high in the star of Sherwood’s Rhonehurst Stables, from where Reg Hobbs trained Battleship to win the 1938 Grand National, it is also back coursing through the veins of a trainer relishing being back on the big Saturday stage. When he started training in 1984, the Chelsea supporter who had been a champion amateur in the 1978/80 season and served an apprenticeship with legendary Fred Winter, Arthur Moore and Gavin Pritchard-Gordon, was regarded as champion trainer material. A seamless flow of headline winners with horses like Berude Not To, Coulton, Lord Of The River, Young Pokey, Young Snugfit and Large Action, a 15-time winner who was second to Alderbrook in the 1995 Champion Hurdle. But the City crash hit him hard, horses numbers fell and he tumbled down the fashion scale. His last Grade One win came via Cenkos in 2000 before being switched by owner Andy Stewart to the Paul Nicholls stable and the last of Sherwood’s six Festival winners came 20 years ago when Jamie Osborne-ridden Coulton won the Cathcart Chase. He was even forced to sell Rhonehurst before leasing it back. That back story was why Many Cloud’s Hennessy win was welcomed with emotional scenes in the Newbury winner’s enclosure. Sherwood said: ‘It was tough. I would never have walked away because I can’t do anything else. But I got down big time. My wife Tarnya was a huge positive. I did lose confidence and doubted myself big time. ‘When I started training it was boom time. You didn’t have to sell yourself. I was having had that success it was tough and was spoilt. ‘In racing success breeds success but I am the world’s worse at selling myself. I hate rejection. It is like chatting up a girl who is not interested.’ It is hard not to be interested now. Many Clouds, who will have a Grand National entry as a back-up to his potential Gold Cup bid, would be only a second Gold Cup runner for his trainer. The first was 1990 Hennessy winner Arctic Call, who was pulled up behind Garrison Savannah. Sherwood said: ‘Many Clouds is a better horse than him. It is a very open race this year. (Favourite) Silviniaco Conti has to prove himself around Cheltenham and the Irish haven’t got a stand out contender. Many Clouds has improved every chase he has run.’","Many Clouds won the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury in November .

"Paul Nicholls still regards Zarkandar as his No 1 World Hurdle hope despite bookmakers having Saturday’s Cleeve Hurdle winner Saphir Du Rheu shorter in the betting. Ladbrokes, sponsors of the Cheltenham Festival target run over three miles, make Saphir Du Rheu the 7-1 second favourite behind defending champion More Of That after his successful switch back to hurdling following a mixed foray into the novice chase arena. Saphir Du Rheu received 4lb and beat Reve De Sivola a neck at Cheltenham. Paul Nicholls still regards Zarkandar as his No 1 World Hurdle hope despite bookmakers saying otherwise . In contrast, Zarkandar, a 10-1 shot, was beaten a head on level terms by the same rival in last month’s Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot when he appeared to throw away victory when idling after jumping into the lead at the last flight. Quoted of his website, Nicholls said: ‘Long term I still see Saphir Du Rheu as a top-class chaser who could well be heading for the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March next year. ‘First though comes the World Hurdle in which we also run Zarkandar, who is arguably our No 1 contender as he is more streetwise and has much more experience. ‘But Saphir Du Rheu has a decent chance, too. There is plenty of improvement to come as I was a little worried that he might be a bit short of fitness going to Cheltenham after a stop start campaign. The race will have brought him on and we know now that he stays the trip well.’ Saphir Du Rheu is second favourite behind defending champion More Of That . Meanwhile, Nicholls has entered Irish Saint in this Saturday’s big race at Sandown, the two-and-a-half mile Grade One Scilly Isles Novices’ Chase. The six-year-old, a winner at Ascot last month, has already run twice at Sandown, winning in November before finishing third to stablemare Vibrato Valtat in the Grade One Henry VIII Novices’ Chase over two miles. Other entries for the Scilly Isles include Nicky Henderson’s Josses Hill, last season’s Supreme Novices’ Hurdle winner who has not convinced with his jumping in his first two starts over fences.

"Trainer Gary Moore has admitted that Sire De Grugy is likely to be short of peak fitness when he returns from injury in the Game Spirit Chase at Newbury on February 7. The Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase hero has not run since winning at Sandown in April last year, having his plans for this season disrupted by a setback. Moore told At The Races: 'He's not as fit as I'd like at this stage. He worked this morning and he worked well - as long as he improves for his work on Saturday I'll be satisfied, but he did look like he needed the work this morning.' Sire De Grugy is still working towards full fitness after a lengthy lay-off through injury . Jamie Moore congratulates his charge after victory in the Queen Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham . Asked if he was confident the nine-year-old was as good as ever, Moore said: 'I couldn't answer that question truthfully now, but I'd be very disappointed if he wasn't and very surprised if he wasn't. 'I don't think he'll go to Newbury as fit as he can be, but it's not all about Newbury is it. Another two-mile star, Sprinter Sacre, made his return from a long absence at Ascot over the weekend, finishing second to Dodging Bullets. Assessing his performance, Moore said: 'He didn't fill me with any dread, obviously there's issues going on with the horse but he looked extremely fit the other day and I don't think he blew up, he was probably race-rusty. 'You can't leave Dodging Bullets out of it (Champion Chase equation), he's taken nearly the same route as us last year and doing the same as we did. It's not just a two-horse race.' Barry Geraghty rides Sprinter Sacre to a second placed finish at Ascot over the weekend . Trainer Gary Moore plans to school Sprinter Sacre over fences in the coming weeks . With his recuperation having gone well, Moore is set to school his stable star over fences for the first time since his setback. He added: 'I'm going to sit down and talk things through with Jamie (Moore, jockey), but the plan is to school him for the first time since his accident either tomorrow morning or even Friday. We'll just have to see how he is and also, more importantly, watch what the weather does. 'The plan is still very much to head to Newbury two weeks on Saturday for the Game Spirit. We'll continue to step up his work between now and then with his last proper piece of work on the Tuesday before.'","Sire De Grugy set to return from injury at the Game Spirit Chase, Newbury .

"Djakadam has booked his likely place in the Cheltenham Gold Cup field in March after impressively defying top weight in the Thyestes Chase at Gowran Park. The  success for the Ruby Walsh-ridden winner was also a record sixth win in the race for trainer Willie Mullins. Gold Cup sponsors Betfred reacted by slashed Djakadam’s Gold Cup odds to 14-1. Ruby Walsh riding Djakadam on their way to winning The Goffs Tyhestes Handicap Steeple Chase . Djakadam (centre) saw his odds for the Cheltenham Gold Cup slashed to 14-1 after victory at Gowran Park . The French-bred gelding will be hoping for better luck than on his previous sorties to Britain. He fell four out when still in with a chance in the JLT Novices’ Chase at last year’s Festival and faded into eighth being Many Clouds after being sent off a well-backed 5-1 favourite in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury in November. Mullins, who moved ahead of the previous Thyestes race record held by Jim Dreaper, said: ‘It’s fantastic to win the race six times. It took me long enough to win my first one. ‘On His Own won this off top weight and was only just beaten in a Gold Cup (last season) so we’ll have to think of going the same way with this horse. ‘We always thought he could be a Gold Cup horse. It was probably an unfair question to ask him in the Hennessy on his first run of the season but we felt he was nicely handicapped. Jockey Walsh beams after giving trainer Willie Mullins a record sixth win at the race . ‘That race will take a fair bit out of him so he wouldn’t run between now and Cheltenham. The way he travelled and jumped was great, and I don’t think Ruby had a moment’s worry.’ Djakadam raced on the heels of the leaders throughout the race before smoothly moving into contention. The Job Is Right was his only danger in the straight. He fell at the last but Walsh had still to ask for everything and looked comfortably in control.","Djakadam won the the Thyestes Chase at Gowran Park on Thursday .

"Sean O'Brien remains in contention to end an injury-plagued 14 months by making a comeback for the Irish Wolfhounds against England Saxons. O'Brien has not featured for Ireland since damaging his shoulder in the 24-22 autumn Test defeat to New Zealand in November 2013. The 27-year-old was closing in on a playing return after surgery when an infection forced a second operation on the same shoulder. Sean O'Brien (left) has not played for Ireland since the 24-22 defeat to New Zealand in November 2013 . O'Brien could yet face the Saxons in Cork on Friday night, while Ireland remain confident both Conor Murray and Eoin Reddan will be fit to open the Six Nations in Italy on February 7. 'Sean trained fully today (Tuesday), trained last week in Leinster and has taken part in all the sessions,' said Irish Wolfhounds coach Richie Murphy. 'There is a possibility that he will be available this week.' While flanker O'Brien could still feature in Cork, his Leinster team-mate Cian Healy's chances now appear remote. Ireland scrum halves Conor Murray (left) and Eoin Reddan are both expected to be fit for the Italy clash . The destructive loosehead prop has battled hamstring problems since September, but like O'Brien, is targeting a Test return during the Six Nations. British and Irish Lions scrum-half Murray continues to battle disc problems in his neck, but Ireland's skills coach Murphy still tipped him to feature at the Stadio Flaminio on Saturday week. Leinster half-back Reddan damaged knee ligaments in Saturday's 20-20 Champions Cup draw at Wasps, but Ireland bosses now believe his injury is not as severe as anticipated. 'Both guys look like they'll be fit,' said Murphy of Murray and Reddan's chances of facing Italy. 'Eoin's knee injury is not as bad as first feared, in the last 24 hours he's seen a massive improvement. 'We are hoping that both of those guys will be ready for next week and if they're not it opens up an opportunity for Isaac Boss and Kieron Marmion to come in. 'Cian (Healy is a little further behind Sean (O'Brien), but is doing pretty well.' Leinster loosehead prop Cian Healy has been battling hamstring problems since September . Murphy revealed Ireland expect Lions fly-half Johnny Sexton to be available for the second round of Six Nations action against France in Dublin on February 14. Sexton is forced to sit out the Italy clash while he completes a 12-week stand-down period enforced by club Racing Metro after four concussions in 12 months. Sexton's absence leaves Leinster's Ian Madigan and Munster's Ian Keatley vying for the starting berth in Rome, with Paddy Jackson also sidelined after elbow surgery. Murphy hinted that Madigan may be handed the fly-half reins for Friday's Wolfhounds match, having featured mainly at centre for Leinster this term. 'He is very nearly ready to go,' said Murphy of Sexton. 'Obviously he picked up that injury in France so his club looked after that. Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton is expected to return in time for the game against France at the Aviva Stadium . 'He's not taking contacts, he can't take contact until the three months is up and that would be the week of the French match. 'Until that time it looks like he is going to be out, but he trained today, did all the handling stuff, all the non-contact training and all the fitness work, so he's looking very fit and very fresh. 'You'd fancy that because he's been doing all the handling, all the kicking, all that kind of stuff, the contact stuff will fall into place that week.' Murphy admitted Madigan not featuring regularly at fly-half is 'definitely an issue' for Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt. The 25-year-old may now start at 10 against the Saxons to ease him through to the Six Nations opener in Rome. 'It's definitely an issue,' said Murphy of Madigan's limited club time at fly-half. 'When he has played there this year he has been pretty good. 'Joe (Schmidt) will have to make a decision on that later in the week. 'The Saxons match might be an opportunity for Ian Madigan to get a little bit of game time at 10.

Cannon rode The Giant Bolster for the first time when the partnership finished just over 14 lengths behind Silviniaco Conti in the Betfair Chase at Haydock in December. Bridgwater said of his chaser: ‘His first run (this season) at Wetherby was rubbish but his second run at Haydock was brilliant and Tom gave him a lovely ride.

"England are resigned to being without Brad Barritt and Geoff Parling for their RBS Six Nations opener against Wales and there are on-going doubts about two of their other casualties. The national team’s injury crisis continues to rage on unchecked, with Wednesday's confirmation that Saracens centre Barritt and Leicester lock Parling will miss the trip to Cardiff next Friday. Those setbacks add to an absentee list which already features Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan, Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes. Brad Barritt and Billy Vunipola (right) take a stroll at Pennyhill Park as England train on Tuesday . But there may be further setbacks in the offing, as head coach Stuart Lancaster and his assistants await updates on the state of Tom Wood’s ankle and Kyle Eastmond’s shoulder. At this stage, the severity of the injuries hampering the Northampton flanker and Bath centre remain unclear, but they must be considered in grave danger of missing at least the clash with Wales. Lancaster tried to adopt a positive tone at the tournament launch on Wednesday morning, saying: ‘The current situation is that Geoff Parling and Brad Barritt are in pretty good shape really. We don't anticipate the injuries will be any more than a couple of weeks really. We will see how they go over the next 24 hours but we are pretty optimistic about Geoff and Brad. ‘Tom Wood and Kyle Eastmond are going to have further assessments that are going to take place in the next 24 hours and we will have a bit more information on that after those assessments.’ Kyle Eastmond (right) is still not fully fit as he recovers from a shoulder injury . Tom Wood has an ankle injury which may rule him out of England's clash with Wales . Stuart Lancaster (right, with Chris Robshaw at the Six Nations launch) has mounting injury problems . Asked about the anticipated timescale for Barritt and Parling to back available again, he added: ‘Obviously the clock is ticking for the Wales game, but I wouldn't rule Geoff and Brad out of the Italy game just yet. ‘We need all the players who are going to be considered for the Wales game to be training on Sunday and Monday. If that comes too soon we will rehab and get them back and they might take part in training towards the end of the week but the view then would be to try to get them to begin training the week of the Italy game. ‘I am very confident that Brad and Geoff are going to be fine sooner rather than later. I don't want to commit on Tom and Kyle because it is going to rest very much on what the specialists say.

"England have been coming to terms with the ‘big loss’ of Owen Farrell for their entire RBS Six Nations campaign and bracing themselves for further upheaval, with Brad Barritt destined to be ruled out of the opener, at least. The RFU confirmed on Tuesday that the most experienced fly-half in the squad had sustained a ‘high-grade’ medial ligament strain in his left knee during Saracens’ European Champions Cup defeat at Clermont Auvergne and would miss the championship campaign. That bleak bulletin was accompanied by updates on the state of other frontline casualties, including his clubmate Barritt, who was on course to start at inside centre against Wales in Cardiff a week on Friday. Owen Farrell and Brad Barritt are set to miss England opening Six Nations owing to injury . Farrell (far left) suffered a knee injury after falling awkwardly following a tackle from Clermont's Julian Bardy . Instead, the man whose bloody, selfless heroism underpinned the victory over Australia at the end of November is almost certain to be counted out of that explosive fixture at the Millennium Stadium, having also strained a knee ligament in France on Sunday. The upshot is that England find themselves with an alarming dearth of fit and firing centres as they prepare to face an onslaught from the Welsh midfield Lions, Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies. Manu Tuilagi has already all but counted himself out of the whole tournament because of his persisting groin injury, while Luther Burrell suffered concussion during Northampton’s loss to Racing Metro on Saturday and will be monitored for the remainder of this week. His hopes of being available to play in Cardiff are in the balance. Meanwhile, Bath’s Kyle Eastmond went off with another ‘stinger’ blow to his left shoulder — his second in successive matches — early in the West Country club’s win over Glasgow, so he is also in doubt. The England management have been assailed by bad news and uncertainty at just the wrong time. Ben Morgan’s broken leg has robbed them of the leading performer in the autumn series, while leading locks Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury are both absent — the latter for the whole championship. There have been further disruptions to the pack, with Tom Wood nursing a sprained ankle and Geoff Parling ruled out with a knee injury. Barritt walks away during his return to club side Saracens last weekend in a 33-10 victory over Munster . After having a scan, Wood tweeted on Tuesday night: ‘Aside from the obvious bruising/swelling, the scan revealed some potential issues. I’m not ruling myself out just yet.’ In total, 12 England players who would be considered for selection are likely to be unavailable, but the biggest concerns, without question, are in midfield. At present, England have only two fully-fit centres — Billy Twelvetrees and Jonathan Joseph. They may have to settle for a selection that ignores form, with fitness being the deciding factor. Burrell has been outstanding for Northampton this season, but he has had a dip in recent weeks. Twelvetrees, meanwhile, has been unconvincing for Gloucester, with frequent lapses in concentration and execution undermining his undoubted all-round class. Whatever the misgivings, there is every chance that the combination, which featured in all five games in last year’s tournament, will be reunited next week. The loss of Farrell is of symbolic concern for England as he is an established leader in the squad whose mental strength and goal-kicking quality make him a reassuring presence when the fur is flying. He would have been the replacement fly-half in Cardiff, deputising for George Ford, but instead that role will be a two-way tussle. England head coach Stuart Lancaster is having to contend with a host of injury headaches . Unless Stuart Lancaster chooses not to put a specialist No 10 on the bench, which is unlikely but not unthinkable, Stephen Myler and Danny Cipriani will go head to head to claim that place. The exploits of Cipriani since joining Sale were acclaimed yesterday by Nick Easter, the recalled Harlequins No 8, who played with him when the newcomer ran Ireland ragged at Twickenham. ‘One of the most enjoyable games I played with England was with him at 10 versus Ireland in 2008,’ said Easter. ‘He suffered a bad ankle injury after his golden year, but he has knuckled down. He looks to me to be more of a complete player now, with less of the showman stuff that he had in him. Now it’s more about, “Right, how do we get over the gain-line and get into good positions?”’ Easter acknowledged Farrell’s absence would be keenly felt, saying: ‘He is one of the key leaders; a driving force of the attack and the gameplan. He has clearly proved his status on the international stage and will be a big loss.’ However, Easter is convinced England can cope with the injuries which have drastically undermined their preparations, adding: ‘The strength in depth in rugby in this country is fantastic. We’re equipped to deal with that. We are very confident.’ Easter has profited from the broken leg suffered by Morgan to end his three-and-a-half year international exile. Billy Vunipola is higher in the No 8 pecking order but Easter said: ‘The intensity and training will step up over the next week and that’s a chance for me to show what I’m about. But I don’t want to be holding tackle bags. I want to get selected and show what I can do in a white shirt again.","England Rugby's Twitter account confirmed that Owen Farrell is set to miss the entire Six Nations campaign through injury .

"Wales flanker Dan Lydiate has revealed Warren Gatland’s men will seek to exploit any ‘chinks in the armour’ of England in their Six Nations opener next week. England hooker Dylan Hartley, whose ill-discipline has led to career suspensions totalling 50 weeks, has been warned by forwards coach Graham Rowntree that he can expect intense goading in Cardiff. Lydiate  conceded that ‘chatting’ with opponents is part and parcel of the game. Dan Lydiate warn England they will face a huge battle in the Six Nations opener . Lydiate poses with the Six Nations trophy after Wales beat France in 2012 . ‘Some players are more vocal than others,’ said Lydiate. ‘In your own team you have leaders who do the main chatting in a game. You look for chinks in the armour.’ Gatland believes the decision to sacrifice rugby training for fitness drills helped Wales overcome their southern hemisphere demons during the autumn internationals. A 12-6 victory over South Africa ended a run of 22 consecutive defeats to the ‘big three’ and Gatland believes adopting a pre-season style fitness programme before the four-Test series paid dividends. Early preparations were based around 6.30am bike training followed by sessions in the cryotheraphy chamber, as the coaches focused on narrowing the speed deficit between the northern and southern hemisphere. Warren Gatland will pend more time working on the skills of his Wales squad for the Six Nations . ‘We flipped it over for the last two weeks,’ Gatland told ESPN. ‘For New Zealand and South Africa, we did a lot of rugby. Against the All Blacks we were winning after 69 minutes and in the past they beat us by playing rugby. But we coped with that and I remember thinking “we’ve never been in this situation before”.’ GPS data shows the rugby played by the Welsh regions is much slower than the Super Rugby competition in the southern hemisphere. A Welsh regional player covers 55 metres per minute on average while in Super Rugby it’s 90 metres per minute. Consequently, Wales spent minimal time working on skills during the first half of their November camp. However, Gatland is unlikely to take the same approach preparing for the England game. ‘The Six Nations is different,’ said the Wales coach.","Wales open their Six Nations campaign against England .

Warriors back Maitland also had a specialist scan on Monday at the BMI Ross Hall Hospital in Glasgow which showed damage to his shoulder sustained in the 20-15 defeat at the Rec. Both players have returned to the care of their clubs' medical teams but Dark Blues head coach Vern Cotter hopes they will be fit enough to take part later in the championship.

"The World Cup winner in England’s midst is hoping to use the example of his previous charges as evidence that even unfancied teams can go all the way. Paul Farbrace was the coach who guided Sri Lanka to both the World Twenty20 title and Asia Cup last year before being targeted by Paul Downton to work alongside Peter Moores in the new England regime. Now, having made an excellent impression in his first summer as assistant coach, he is hoping to bring his limited-overs expertise to an England team who have been starved of 50-over success for far too long. England assistant coach Paul Farbrace leads a nets session on Tuesday at the WACA in Perth . Farbrace talks to Jos Buttler in Perth as England prepare for their Tri-series match with India . ‘I wouldn’t sit here now and say we’re going to win the World Cup,’ said Farbrace at the WACA after England’s gruelling training session in the extreme heat of Western Australia. ‘But what I would say is that if you get through to the knockout stages then anything is possible. ‘My experience with Sri Lanka is that we went into our final group game of the World Twenty20 against New Zealand and we struggled with the bat. 'But we ended up winning the game and then did the same against West Indies when Duckworth Lewis went our way. All of a sudden we were in the final. ‘Our aim now is to get to the quarter-finals of the World Cup and then anything can happen. People have said we’ve got no chance and they can think what they want but we know we’re improving all the time, we’re working really hard and we want to give ourselves the best chance we possibly can.’ Certainly the structure of another elongated World Cup should benefit England. They may be in the tougher of the two groups but all they really need to do is beat Scotland and Afghanistan to reach the last eight. Ian Bell (left) and Moeen Ali head out for a nets session at the WACA ahead of England's match with India . Buttler keeps his eye on the ball as England train in Perth ahead of the India contest . England captain Eoin Morgan takes part in a fielding drill as his team bid to reach the Tri-series final . Stuart Broad faces the media on the outfield at the WACA, where temperatures have soared to 40C . They have already been told their quarter-final will be in Melbourne which means there is no real benefit in winning the group. And as long as they make the last eight they will probably meet Pakistan, West Indies, India or South Africa and only the last of those teams would be a really big obstacle to the semi-finals. India may be the defending champions but they are not looking like it in Australia. They are already weary having lost a Test series here and seemed uninterested when they were thrashed by England in the Tri-series in Brisbane. Their rained-off match against Australia in Sydney means that India’s second clash with England here at the WACA on Friday becomes a winner takes all affair but Eoin Morgan’s side have good reason to be optimistic of reaching Sunday’s final against Australia. While England worked hard India were nowhere to be seen and apparently they have no plans to train again on Wednesday, apparently because it’s too hot here in Perth. Yet Friday’s match will be played during the day so they will have no way of avoiding the 40 degrees plus temperature then. Bell celebrates his century in England's loss to Australia in Hobart on Friday last week . Bell has been in excellent form as England's opener during the Tri-series against India and Australia . ‘India’s washout didn’t help us in theory but it’s probably want we want because it makes Friday effectively a semi-final,’ said Farbrace. ‘We want to put the boys under pressure and that’s what they will be on Friday. ‘Let’s be honest, we’ve talked a lot about development and improvement but winning is the key and this is a chance for us to win a game and give ourselves another chance against Australia before the World Cup starts.' India looked like a team who had never played on a pitch with bounce at the Gabba and those conditions should be even more apparent at the WACA. ‘They’re the best two grounds we could have played India on,’ said Farbrace. ‘I think our bowlers will be running in excited about bowling on here. We watched the Big Bash game here on Sunday and it was exciting to see the ball flying through.’ Steven Finn has also been rediscovering some of his best form as England warm up for the World Cup . England's Ali bats during the narrow defeat to Australia in the Tri-series last week . That will put the onus on an England bowling attack led by Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, who are still returning to their best after injury. ‘They’re not far away and I think every game back helps,’ said Farbrace. ‘Steven Finn and Chris Woakes have done well too. Woakesy is a sign of where we are as a team. At the start of last summer he wasn’t in the team and now he’s almost one of our first picks. 'By playing consistently and with the selectors backing him he’s growing in confidence and his performances have improved. That’s what’s happening to the team as well.’ Quietly England are coming together here. And wins against India and, finally, Australia are needed now to prove it.","Assistant coach confident England can defy expectations at the World Cup .

"Australia legend Brett Lee was denied a fairytale end to his professional cricket career as the Perth Scorchers beat his Sydney Sixers with a scrambled last-ball single to retain their Big Bash League title. With Perth needing just one run from three balls to complete a chase of 148 in Canberra, 38-year-old paceman Lee took two wickets in two balls.

But Henriques, who had earlier made 77 in the Sixers' 147-5 and hadn't put a foot wrong in the field, was unable to take in Michael Lumb's throw to stump Arafat and take the final to a Super Over.

"Two years as a frustrated spectator could soon end for Tom Croft after the injury-plagued Leicester flanker was last night drafted into the England squad for the first time since 2013. Croft has been promoted from the Saxons as cover for Northampton back row Tom Wood, who is himself undergoing assessments by Stuart Lancaster’s medical team on an ankle injury picked up in Saturday’s Champions Cup defeat by Racing Metro. It is a rare piece of good news for Croft, 29, and a reward for his endeavour where many might have given up. The British and Irish Lion has suffered rotten luck throughout his career; with neck, knee and shoulder problems restricting him to eight club appearances since the 2012-13 season. Tom Croft is hoping to put an injury-plagued tenure behind him with his England return . Croft (centre) crosses the line to score a try for the British and Irish Lions in 2013 . He is out of contract at Leicester this summer and his future in England has been in doubt. The East Midlands club have insisted on a pay cut to reflect the player’s injury record but this latest return to the international set-up could convince Croft to stay put. Following an abrasive weekend of European action, Croft was last night joined in the squad at Pennyhill Park by Saints lock Christian Day. The uncapped forward will provide cover for Geoff Parling, who is expected to be sidelined for four weeks with a knee injury. Bath flanker Carl Fearns and Wasps lock James Gaskell will replace Croft and Day in the Saxons squad for Friday night’s fixture against Ireland Wolfhounds in Cork. But there could yet be more additions to the senior Six Nations party over the coming days. Updates on the fitness of Brad Barritt (knee), Kyle Eastmond (shoulder) and Owen Farrell (knee) are expected this afternoon. The latter is a particular concern after he was seen leaving the Stade Marcel-Michelin on Sunday evening on crutches with his left knee strapped in a brace. Croft is out of contract at Leicester in the summer and his England future had been in doubt . England boss Stuart Lancaster faces an anxious wait to find out if he needs to add other players to his squad . ‘It’s too early to give any definitive news on their fitness,’ said Lancaster. ‘Tom’s ankle and Owen’s knee have been scanned. Owen sees a specialist and we will then be able to provide an update on him and the other injured players, along with any other potential additions to the squad.’ With England already short on centres, including the notable absence of Manu Tuilagi, Lancaster is confident midfield powerhouse Luther Burrell will be back training on Friday. But Saracens flanker Will Fraser will play no part in this year’s World Cup plans after he was ruled out for the remainder of the season yesterday morning. The 25-year-old will undergo surgery on a back problem this afternoon, as confirmed by Mark McCall. The Saracens director of rugby said: ‘It’s obviously disappointing for Will and for us. But it’s obviously in everybody’s interest to sort out these issues once and for all. Will is only 25 and he has plenty of great rugby in him, for club and country.’ While clubs enjoy a rest period from the Aviva Premiership, directors of rugby across the country will turn their focus to recruitment for the 2015/16 season. Sportsmail understands that Exeter are looking at Springbok scrum half Francois Hougaard as a potential marquee signing and they will keep a close eye on the No 9 when he plays for the Blue Bulls in a friendly match against Saracens on Saturday. Owen Farrell will have a scan on a knee problem and will also visit a specialist about it . Francois Hougaard (right) has been linked with a move to Exeter . They are not yet able to enter discussions with the 26-year-old because of his contractual agreement to South Africa. It is understood Exeter will face stiff competition from clubs in France and Japan. The 27-cap international is one of his country’s highest-profile sportsmen and dated Reeva Steenkamp, the murdered ex- girlfriend of Oscar Pistorius. Scrum-half reinforcements are high on the shopping list of Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter, who lost out to Wasps in the battle to sign Gloucester No 9 Dan Robson. Hougaard can also play on the wing and scored the 2014 IRPA try of the year in the 27-25 victory over New Zealand during the Rugby Championship.","Tom Croft  called up to the England squad for the first time in 2013 .

"James Anderson, England’s leading international wicket-taker, talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes and career highlight to who would play him in a movie about his life. WHO IS YOUR SPORTING HERO? Boris Becker. I played a lot of tennis when I was younger and I just admired his athleticism and charisma around the court. James Anderson, England’s leading international wicket-taker, talks to Sportsmail . WHAT WOULD YOU BE IF YOU WEREN'T A SPORTSMAN? No idea really. I did business and finance at school so maybe something to do with that. I would certainly have tried to go to university if not for sport. I have dabbled in a few things off the pitch such as clothes designing (613collection.com) and radio presenting - it’s been interesting trying new things outside of cricket. WHAT OTHER SPORTSMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE? Rory McIlroy. I love golf and there’s nobody better than him right now. WHAT IS YOUR CAREER HIGHLIGHT? It’s a toss up between winning the Ashes in Australia in 2010-11 and defeating India away as both are pretty rare. From a personal point of view taking four wickets against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup in Cape Town. Anderson said if he could be another sportsman it would be Rory McIlroy . Anderson ended the match with four wickets for just 18 runs as England cruised to victory . AND THE WORST MOMENT? Losing 5-0 to Australia twice. Don’t have to look any further than that! IF YOUR HOUSE WAS BURNING DOWN WHAT POSSESSION WOULD YOU SAVE? Once my family and dogs were safe I’d save my golf clubs and also the mementos I’ve collected throughout my career. WHAT'S THE BEST ADVICE YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN? There isn’t one bit of advice that sticks out. I’ve been fortunate to work with and meet some very experienced cricketers and I have tried to learn what I can and apply it to my game. I think it’s important to try and keep learning all the time no matter how much you have played. WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE KARAOKE SONG? Sweet Child of Mine by Guns and Roses. I’m much better in the shower or car than I am with a microphone in my hand! Anderson revealed that his sporting hero was German tennis star Boris Becker . THREE MOST LISTENED TO SONGS ON YOUR IPOD? Right now it’s Royal Blood, Alt-J and Kasabian’s new album. I love music and am proud to be ambassador of the music charity Nordoff Robbins. LAST FILM YOU SAW? Last time I went to the cinema was to see Inbetweeners 2, which was okay but they’re never as good as the original are they? LAST BOOK YOU READ? I’m not a regular book reader. I do a bit on tour so I’m looking forward to reading Roy Keane’s autobiography this winter. WHICH THREE FAMOUS PEOPLE WOULD YOU WANT TO DINNER AND WHY? Boris Becker and Rory McIlroy for the reasons I’ve mentioned and Bob Willis because I’ve heard he’s got a wicked sense of humour and would love to see that side of him. Anderson is congratulated by Joe Root after dismissing India's Shikhar Dhawan in Tuesday's match . The England bowler said that the last film he had seen  was The Inbetweeners 2 . FAVOURITE PRE-MATCH MEAL? Spaghetti with olive oil and garlic. I try and be healthy before a game so I can enjoy a post match burger! CAN YOU COOK AND WHAT'S YOUR BEST DISH? Yes I can cook a bit. I like doing a Sunday roast but my best creation is lamb chops and mashed potatoes. FAVOURITE HOLIDAY DESTINATION? I loved the Maldives when I went there but I holidayed in Tahiti once and that’s a bit different so I’ll go for there. IN A FILM OF YOUR LIFE WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY YOU? Colin Farrell - or Jim Carrey. What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought? My house I guess! I’m a tight northerner so I don’t spend money too often. TELL US A SECRET? I’m a Burnley lad and am delighted that my team are back in the Premier League but when they were in the lower divisions I did have a brief spell supporting Arsenal instead.... Anderson admitted that although he was from Burnley he also supported Arsenal .

"England were written off as World Cup no-hopers by former players like Michael Vaughan and Graeme Swann before they arrived in Australia but here they have been backed as a surprise package by perhaps an unlikely source. Kevin Pietersen may have trashed England in his controversial autobiography but he left Perth on Sunday after bowing out of the Big Bash League with some encouraging words for the team that have moved on without him. ‘Now they have got Eoin Morgan as skipper I think England are going to go really well,’ said Pietersen, who found success and enjoyment with Melbourne Stars. ‘They’re getting scores over 300 and Ian Bell is batting beautifully.’ Kevin Pietersen believes England can do 'really well' with Eoin Morgan as captain in Australia . The England team has moved on without Pietersen (right) but he was still full of praise . Ian Bell has been in fine form during the tri-series Down Under this month . Both Vaughan and Swann suggested England ‘did not have a cat in hell’s chance’ of winning the World Cup before they replaced Alastair Cook as captain with Morgan and it is the change at the top that has led to Pietersen’s optimism. ‘I’ve been in that team and players talk,’ he said. ‘If Cook’s position was being spoken about as much as it was on TV and in the media then I know it was being talked about in the dressing room. ‘I’m just happy it was done for Cook’s sake, for England’s sake and they can move forward with the one-day side now. You can just see it with the scores they are getting now. I know there was a stutter against Australia in Sydney but that can happen and doesn’t mean anything.’ Pietersen has less faith in an England bowling line-up that lacks the variety of a left-arm bowler in both pace and spin. ‘It’s a very exciting batting team, I just have a little reservation about the bowling,’ he said. Pietersen says Stuart Broad 'doesn't look right' and isn't bowling as fast as he should . The explosive batsman impressed for the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash League . Ben Stokes also found form, but was demoted to the England Lions tour and Pietersen says that's a mistake . ‘Jimmy Anderson looks great but Broady doesn’t look quite right. He’s not bowling as fast as he could which might be down to coming back off his knee injury. Hopefully he will get a bit faster. ‘I just think England missed a trick with Ben Stokes. Imagine him batting at three and doing a Jacques Kallis job? He came out here to the Big Bash and first game, batting at three, he hit 70-odd from 30 balls. ‘Just imagine him in that line up? Ali, Bell, Stokes, Root, Morgan, Bopara, Buttler. Would you want to bowl at that?’ Pietersen clearly hasn’t changed his opinion on James Taylor, who he said should have followed his father and become a jockey rather than a cricketer in his book. And he believes that Stokes long run of poor form with both bat and ball going back to England’s tour of West Indies should have been overlooked. Pietersen, whose future in English cricket is in doubt, hasn't changed his opinion on James Taylor . ‘He’s had a poor year but he’s been up and down and thrown around,’ said Pietersen of the Durham all-rounder. ‘he’s played a lot of cricket against sub-continental teams whereas the World Cup is in Australia and he was one batter last year who did so well here, scoring that century here in Perth. ‘I understand he’s had a poor run but that was mainly on the sub-continent and against spinners.’ Pietersen has now returned to England where his future in the domestic game is very much in doubt with Surrey having no plans to re-sign him for this season. But clearly he feels that England are now moving in the right direction.","Kevin Pietersen trashed England in his controversial autobiography .

'I am delighted to be committing my long-term future to Yorkshire,' he said. 'It has been an incredible year for me and I just want to keep on improving.

'What we are seeing now is a growing maturity about his batting. 'He is potentially close to an England call-up, which is testament to his ability as one of the country's leading players.'

"It is a measure of how far Moeen Ali has come in a very short space of time that he should be chosen for the front cover of this year’s Wisden. This time last year he was just one of the many promising emerging players about to be given a chance in an England team forced to start again in the wake of their Ashes humiliation. Now he is a significant figure in cricket and culturally, having first proved to be a role model for British Muslims and then showed what an exciting cricketer he is with both bat and ball. England all-rounder Moeen Ali has been revealed as the 2015 Wisden Almanack front cover star . Ali has shot to prominence for the Three Lions since making his international debut last February . Ali appears on the cover of the Wisden Almanack . Moeen knows what it means to be highlighted by the cricket bible. It would be no surprise if Lawrence Booth, Wisden editor and Sportsmail cricket writer, selects him as one of his five cricketers of the year when the almanack is released in April. ‘It’s gone very quickly,’ said Moeen. ‘It’s been a really good year and hopefully there will be a few more for me with the England team. ‘Somebody sent me the Wisden picture and it’s really nice. It’s an honour to be on the front of it. I have a couple of copies from the past and my dad’s definitely going to get the new one.’ It would be even better received if Wisden is published on the back of a productive World Cup. Moeen is proving himself just as important to the one-day team as the Test one now, being preferred to Alex Hales as the man given licence to get England off to a flying 50-over start. He scored a hundred as opener against Sri Lanka before Christmas and he put on England’s first century opening stand for two years with Ian Bell against Australia. ‘I don’t think I played that well in Hobart,’ he said. ‘I struggled a bit early on but because Belly was going so well I didn’t have to do anything stupid — even though I did in the end! ‘I didn’t have rhythm and I tried to force it a bit. Belly said, “It’ll come, it’ll come,” but I gave it away and hopefully I can learn from it.’ Ali's spin bowling will be key if England are to do well at the World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand . Ali and Ian Bell put on 113 vs Australia - England's first three-figure ODI opening partnership for two years . Moeen’s off-spin proved far more effective in Test cricket last summer than envisaged, taking 19 wickets against India, and he is proving a quick learner in the one-day game. Now it seems that he will be first-choice spinner and James Tredwell will be consigned to the sidelines. ‘I’ve started off quite well with the ball, trying not to go for too many runs,’ said Moeen. ‘If I bowl flight to these guys they’ll murder it so I try not to give too much air. But when conditions are right with a bit more spin I’ll look to attack a bit more.’ England must beat India at the WACA on Friday to qualify for the Tri-series final against Australia.","Moeen Ali will be the front cover star for the 2015 Wisden Almanack .

"New Zealand batsman Martin Guptill will return to Derbyshire as an overseas signing for the early part of their 2015 season. The opener played eight County Championship matches in both the 2011 and 2012 seasons, scoring 1,131 runs in total at an average of over 40. His contribution helped Derbyshire win the Division Two title three years ago, and he will now return for the first six matches of their campaign this year as they once again seek promotion. Martin Guptill will return to Derbyshire for the start of their 2015 season . Guptill scored 1,131 during two spells at the county in 2011 and 2012 averaging over 40 . The 28-year-old will also play three NatWest T20 Blast matches before linking up with the Black Caps for the one-day international part of their tour of England. He said: 'I always wanted to go back to Derbyshire when the time was right. I get on great with the people and have lots of really good memories. 'Hopefully I can help my county make a quick start to the season to get them in the promotion mix again; and get the lads off to a flier in NatWest T20 Blast.'

"Australia may be heading into the World Cup as firm favourites but underneath the tranquil surface trouble is brewing. Michael Clarke, Australia’s injured captain, is said to be at war with selectors, while his team-mates are believed to want golden boy Steve Smith to be their captain in all forms of the game. All the mutterings of discontent surrounding the World Cup hosts’ captaincy were thrown into the open on Tuesday by a report in the Sydney Morning Herald. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steve Smith adamant Michael Clarke remains Australia captain . The injured Michael Clarke is said to be at war with the selectors and has lost support of the dressing room . Australia captain Clarke with his wife Kyly at the 2015 Allan Border Medal evening in Sydney . In a crisis which could be as damaging for Australia as the sacking of Kevin Pietersen proved for England, Clarke could find his return in time for the World Cup blocked because of his ‘broken relationships’ with those in power and, crucially, his own team. He is a figure who has divided opinion after controversies involving his private life, the ‘homework-gate’ affair in India and his strained relationship with players, notably Shane Watson. A report by Herald chief sports writer Andrew Webster is acknowledged by those close to the Australian camp as being spot on. It is suggested that Clarke, who has been battling back and hamstring problems, has been on a collision course with selectors since November, when they planned to leave him out of the Brisbane Test against India in favour of Phillip Hughes. That plan had to be shelved when the young batsman was fatally hit by a bouncer while playing in a Sheffield Shield match. Clarke earned the respect of the cricketing world for the statesmanship he showed then but now he is battling for his cricketing future as he attempts to prove his fitness for the World Cup by February 21, a deadline set by the selectors. Clarke is said to be furious about the deadline and expected longer to complete his very public return to fitness, which included him lapping the sodden SCG while rain washed out play between Australia and India on Monday. Clarke could find his path back in time for the World Cup blocked by a hierarchy who have had enough of him . Many Australian players now want golden boy Steve Smith to be their captain in all forms of the game . The suspicion is that the selectors are hoping that he fails and they will be able to plan for a future without Clarke and under a captain in Smith in a rich vein of form. George Bailey will lead Australia in the World Cup should Clarke be ruled out but Smith is the future and was exceptional while standing in for Clarke against India. England had a gruelling training session in the extreme heat of Perth, aware of the speculation gripping the old enemy but determined not to be distracted. ‘Whatever team Australia put out against us is going to be a strong one,’ said assistant coach Paul Farbrace. ‘We saw that in Hobart when they made a few changes. ‘They have a lot of high-quality cricketers and someone like Mitchell Starc has stood up because Mitchell Johnson is not here. So what goes on in the Australia camp is no business of ours.’ Smith and his partner Dani Willis arrive for the 2015 Allan Border Medal ceremony .

But the British disappointment in finishing second was compounded by a terrible day for Tomlinson. Kelly Massey (left) in action during the event that took place in Glasgow on Saturday . High-jumper Chris Kandu was among those to set personal bests in the Great Britain team . The former world indoor silver medallist still managed to finish second behind leapt Germany's Julian Howard after posting a first jump of 7.61 metres. But it came at a huge cost. 'I basically tore my hamstring from my take-off leg,' he said. 'It's a great shame really because I was in decent shape but I still finished second. 'But that's the way it goes unfortunately. My indoor season is definitely over now.'","Long-jumper Chris Tomlinson tears hamstring in Glasgow .

"Drugs cheat Lance Armstrong has revealed that he would probably 'do it again' if his cycling career were to start over. The United States Anti Doping Agency (USADA) banned the 43-year-old from the sport for life in 2012, as well as stripping him of his seven Tour de France titles. Armstrong had denied all charges, but then admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2013. The Texas-born rider has been out of the public light since an exclusive interview with Sportsmail's Matt Lawton later that year, but tells the BBC he now believes it is time for forgiven. VIDEO Scroll down for Lance Armstrong: I'd probably do it again . Shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong says he would cheat all over again if the year was 1995 . Armstrong was banned from the sport and stripped of his seven Tour de France titles in 2012 . Armstrong, pictured at a Cancer Congress, was charged with using illicit performance-enhancing drugs . Armstrong admits that while he wouldn't consider cheating again in today's sport, he would in 1995 because of the growth in cycling during his successful years, and the funds received by the Lance Armstrong Foundation, the charity he set up after survivng a cancer scare. Asked if he would cheat again by Dan Roan, Armstrong says: 'It's a complicated question, and my answer is not a popular answer. If I was racing in 2015, no, I wouldn't do it again, because I don't think you have to. 'If you take me back to 1995, when it was completely and totally pervasive, I'd probably do it again. People don't like to hear that.' 'When I made the decision - when my team-mates made that decision, when the whole peloton made that decision - it was a bad decision and an imperfect time. But it happened. 'When Lance Armstrong did that, I know what happened. I know what happened to cycling from 1999 to 2005. I saw its growth, I saw its expansion. The 43-year-old speaks to the BBC's Dan Roan ahead of a  documentary to be broadcast on Thursday . Armstrong confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs to win the Tour de France . Armstrong chats with Emma O'Reilly (centre) and Sportsmail's Matt Lawton in a 2013 exclusive interview . 'I know what happened to the cycling industry. I know what happened to [his bike supplier and sponsor] Trek Bicycles - $100m (£66.5m) in sales, to $1bn in sales. 'I know what happened to my foundation, from raising no money to raising $500m, serving three million people. Do we want to take that away? I don't think anybody says yes.' Armstrong believes he has been made to pay a heavy personal price for an offence he says was committed by many, and is hoping for a reduction in his ban after twice speaking with the Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC). He also believes his seven Tour titles should be restored. 'I think there has to be a winner, I'm just saying that as a fan,' he said. 'There's a huge block in World War One with no winners, and there's another block in World War Two, and then it seems like there's another world war. 'I don't think history is stupid, history rectifies a lot of things. If you ask me what happens in 50 years, I don't think it sits empty... I feel like I won those Tours.' Armstrong, pictured with George Bush, was praised having returned to the sport after suffering with cancer .","Lance Armstrong was banned from cycling in 2012 by USADA .
