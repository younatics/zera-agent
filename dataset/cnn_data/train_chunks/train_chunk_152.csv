"(CNN) -- Apple is known for building excitement over its latest gadgets, but the company's next closely watched event has nothing to do with a product. Instead, anticipation is growing over the scheduled return of Apple's charismatic CEO. Steve Jobs looks gaunt at an event in October. He began a leave of absence three months later. It's been almost six months since Steve Jobs -- who co-founded Apple and has thrilled the public by launching consumer tech favorites such as the iPhone and the iPod -- announced that he was taking a medical leave of absence until the end of June. As that time quickly approaches, Apple fans, investors and observers have been gripped by questions. Will he come back as promised? If so, in what capacity? And how crucial is he still to the company's success? Jobs, who is a pancreatic cancer survivor, revealed at the beginning of this year that a hormone imbalance caused the considerable weight loss that had some speculating whether his cancer had returned.  See a timeline of Jobs' life and career » . ""The remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward, and I've already begun treatment,"" Jobs wrote in a letter addressed to the ""Apple community"" on January 5. ""But, just like I didn't lose this much weight and body mass in a week or a month, my doctors expect it will take me until late this spring to regain it."" There had been little news since. But that all changed Saturday when The Wall Street Journal reported Jobs, 54, had a liver transplant about two months ago in Tennessee. He has been recovering well, but may work part time for several weeks when he returns to work, the newspaper reported. Fortune: Inside Steve Jobs' liver transplant . The fact that the article appeared just hours after Apple began selling its new iPhone 3GS had some bloggers questioning the timing of the report, with some suggesting that the excitement over the rollout helped draw attention away from the revelations about Jobs' health. Apple didn't comment on The Wall Street Journal report directly, answering media questions with the same statement. ""Steve continues to look forward to returning to Apple at the end of June, and there is nothing further to say,"" said Apple spokesman Steve Dowling. Dowling declined to provide a specific date for Jobs' return or say whether Jobs would be making any public appearances or statements. 'Iconic figure' ""This feels like they're clearing the way for his return. But it wouldn't be out of character for Apple to let the deadline slip a bit,"" said Philip Elmer-DeWitt, who writes the Apple 2.0 blog for Fortune magazine and has been covering the company since 1982. ""The real issue of Steve coming back is: How much does the company need him?"" How much, indeed? Investors have been painfully aware of how any development regarding Jobs' health -- real or rumor -- can affect Apple's stock price. But experts say Apple has been taking steps to ensure that its fortunes are not linked with Jobs taking an active role in the company. Watch how Jobs' health has affected Apple . ""He's an iconic figure that everybody wants around, he's the world's greatest salesman and that's irreplaceable,"" said Gene Munster, a senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray who has been covering Apple since 2003. ""But as far as the product direction and the product quality, the road map for the next five years is already in place [at Apple]."" Munster described Jobs as a visionary and someone with the ability to figure out what the next big thing is. But he said Piper Jaffray's ""Buy"" recommendation on the company's stock wouldn't change even if Jobs doesn't come back, based on the strength of products such as the iPhone. Still, few companies have been so closely associated with their CEOs. Munster likened the situation to Henry Ford and the car company he founded at the beginning of the 20th century. Elmer-DeWitt said it could be compared to Walt Disney and the entertainment giant he created. Jobs is also much more than just a CEO. His knack for developing must-have gadgets, his signature black turtlenecks and dramatic delivery during product launches have made him a cultural icon beyond Silicon Valley. He was even hilariously impersonated on ""Saturday Night Live."" Smaller role . Observers say Apple and Jobs himself have made efforts in recent years to ""wean"" the public off his presence, such as including other people onstage with him during events and de-emphasizing his role. ""Last year a lot of pundits were [saying that] if Steve Jobs left the company, the company would just immediately fall into ruin,"" said Daniel Eran Dilger, a contributing editor for AppleInsider.com. ""And what's interesting is after he went on leave, and he's been gone for six months now, the company has had a couple of major announcements and events and has gone on fine."" When he began his leave of absence, Jobs put Apple Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook in charge of the company's day-to-day operations. If Jobs decides to step down, Cook can take over and probably will, Elmer-DeWitt said. ""There are lots of smart people at Apple and most people have sort of accepted the idea that ... Jobs trained an executive team to operate the company without him,"" he added. ""And that his DNA, the thing that makes Apple different from all the other companies, has been baked into the leadership team and that the company will do fine."" What may be lacking years down the road if Jobs retires or leaves is his ""X-factor"" and his unique stamp on every little piece of design. ""Once you get a bunch of people in a room, none of whom is more powerful than the other, you start to get products that are literally designed by committee and that's what Apple products never were,"" Elmer-DeWitt said. ""They were always designed by very smart people that Steve chose. But ultimately there was one guy who had final say on them. It remains to be seen whether there's someone at Apple who can step up and take over that role.""","Apple's charismatic CEO, Steve Jobs, is set to return to work at the end of June .

"(CNN) -- A total of 197 million people were without jobs in 2012, with youth being particularly hard hit, and those unemployment figures will increase again this year, according to an International Labor Organization report released Monday. The bulk of the 4 million newly unemployed in 2012 came from developing economies in East Asia, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, according to the Global Employment Trends 2013 report. The International Labor Organization, which is a United Nations agency responsible for overseeing international labor standards, made bleak projections of another increase in unemployment worldwide by 5.1 million in 2013 -- which would push the total to 202 million. In 2012, 73.8 million young people were unemployed globally. ""Many young people now experience long-term unemployment right from the start of their labor market entry,"" said Guy Ryder, ILO Director-General, during a presentation of the report's findings.  ""When this occurs early on in a person's career, it can do significant damage to their long-term employment prospects."" Although new jobs may open up, they may require different skills than those that match the unemployed workers, according to the report. ""Governments should step up efforts to support skills and retraining activities in order to address such mismatches which particularly affect young people,"" Ryder said. The report advised that the governments should step up efforts to retrain and support job skills to address the differences in work qualifications, with a focus on young people. Youth unemployment is expected to rise in emerging economies in Eastern Europe, East and South-East Asia and the Middle East, according to the report. In developed economies in Europe, firms are reluctant to hire because of uncertainty, the report said. Youth unemployment tops 50% in some European countries. In Latin America, the region's unemployment was at 6.6% in 2012, with a more rapid recovery from the economic crisis. In East Asia, employment expanded only 0.5%. In South Asia, female labor force participation remains low. In the Middle East, unemployment is on the rise again after a decline in the 2000s. But vast differences remain in the region, as oil-producing countries tend to have low unemployment rates. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 77% of workers have what is called ""vulnerable employment."" The report made several recommendations on stemming unemployment globally. Leaders should formulate more ""coherent and predictable"" policy, to address economic uncertainty, it stated.","A total of 197 million people were without a job in 2012, says ILO report .

"(CNN) -- In his first public speech since being inaugurated as president of Yemen, Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi promised a strong fight against al Qaeda and political reconciliation at home. Hadi spoke Saturday before military graduates at the Yemeni Military Academy. ""The real battle against the terrorist al Qaeda organization has yet to begin and will not end until we have eradicated their presence in every district, village and position; it will not end until internally displaced citizens are assured that they can return safely to their homes and organized terrorist operatives have surrendered their weapons and rid themselves of ideologies that contradict the sacred values of the Islamic religion,"" he said. Drone strike kills '13 militants' in Yemen . His public remarks follow a meeting last month with FBI Director Robert Mueller, who visited Yemen to discuss the counterterrorism program there. A presidential aide told CNN that Hadi promised complete cooperation with the United States. Yemen's offensive against al Qaeda comes at a time when it is beset by political turbulence dating to last year. Protests led to the departure of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh from office. Hadi addressed the need for a unified military to ensure stability and security in Yemen. ""I will not allow divisions in the military to continue nor will I allow the military to deviate from its core duties,"" he said. He also called on political parties to build on the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative that paved the way for a transfer of power. ""The (GCC) initiative succeeded in pulling fingers away from the triggers of rifles and encouraging factions to resume dialogue,"" he said. ""Political parties must follow through on the commitments they made when they signed the GCC initiative and its implementation mechanism, halting offensive rhetoric against each other, and launching new policies that promote respect and the right to disagree; in order to affirm peaceful social values, mend the shattered souls, and wipe out provocative thoughts of partition.""","Yemen's president makes his first public speech since taking office .

"(CNN) -- Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly have launched what they hope will mark a new era in the battle over gun rights in America. On the second anniversary of a mass shooting in Arizona that wounded Giffords and killed six others, the couple launched a political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, along with a website calling for contributions to help ""encourage elected officials to stand up for solutions to prevent gun violence and protect responsible gun ownership."" In an op-ed in USA Today, the two make their goal clear: to counter the influence of the gun lobby. ""Special interests purporting to represent gun owners but really advancing the interests of an ideological fringe have used big money and influence to cow Congress into submission,"" they write. ""Rather than working to find the balance between our rights and the regulation of a dangerous product, these groups have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties. Rather than conducting a dialogue, they threaten those who divert from their orthodoxy with political extinction."" Emphasizing that they support the Second Amendment and own two guns themselves, Giffords and Kelly call for ""laws to require responsible gun ownership and reduce gun violence."" ""Until now, the gun lobby's political contributions, advertising and lobbying have dwarfed spending from anti-gun violence groups. No longer. With Americans for Responsible Solutions engaging millions of people about ways to reduce gun violence and funding political activity nationwide, legislators will no longer have reason to fear the gun lobby."" Bloomberg anti-gun ad marks anniversary of Arizona shooting . ""America has seen an astounding 11 mass shootings since a madman used a semiautomatic pistol with an extended ammunition clip to shoot me and kill six others,"" Giffords writes. ""This country is known for using its determination and ingenuity to solve problems, big and small ... But when it comes to protecting our communities from gun violence, we're not even trying -- and for the worst of reasons."" Giffords and Kelly have spoken out in the wake of last month's slaughter in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 27 people murdered, 26 of them at Sandy Hook Elementary School -- including 20 children. Giffords wrote on Facebook at the time, ""As we mourn, we must sound a call for our leaders to stand up and do what is right. This time our response must consist of more than regret, sorrow, and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve leaders who have the courage to participate in a meaningful discussion about our gun laws -- and how they can be reformed and better enforced to prevent gun violence and death in America. This can no longer wait."" Giffords and Kelly visited Newtown last week. They met with local and state leaders to discuss gun control legislation, mental health identification and treatment, and ""concerns for the erosion of our societal values such that we are increasingly desensitized to violence,"" according to Newtown First Selectman Pat Llodra. Giffords told to 'stay out' That visit also highlighted the intense political concerns surrounding such issues. Connecticut State Rep. DebraLee Hovey, the state's assistant Republican leader, posted a note on her Facebook page saying, ""Gabby Gifford stay out of my towns!"" Hovey later issued a statement apologizing, saying, ""Our community has struggled greatly through this tragedy, and we are all very sensitive to the potential for this event to be exploited for political purposes. This is what I wish to avoid."" The statement added that Hovey has advocated for a dialogue on mental health issues, school safety and gun control. Kelly, a former captain in the U.S. Navy and NASA astronaut, also responded publicly in the wake of the Newtown shootings. On his Facebook page, he took on the National Rifle Association -- the central pro-gun rights lobby -- after a news conference by a top NRA official about the Newtown tragedy triggered widespread anger. Kelly wrote that the NRA's response was ""defiant and delayed,"" and that the organization ""chose narrow partisan concerns over the safety of our families and communities."" The NRA has argued that it is committed to keeping people protected, and that a focus on stricter gun control is misguided. ""If it's crazy to call for putting police and armed security in our schools to protect our children, then call me crazy,"" NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre said of the anger following his initial news conference. NRA President David Keene later told CNN the group supports schools choosing whether they want armed guards. Kelly: 'Good guys with guns' aren't the whole answer . LaPierre made clear his group believes that more guns, not fewer, are necessary for security. ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" he said. Kelly said he knows from personal experience that that's not the case. The day Jared Loughner shot Giffords and 18 other people at a public event in Tucson, there was such a ""good guy,"" Kelly argued in an interview with ABC. A man came out ""of the store next door and nearly shot the man who took down Jared Loughner,"" Kelly said. ""The one who eventually wrestled (Loughner) to the ground was almost killed himself by a good guy with a gun, so I don't really buy that argument."" Giffords and Kelly want to require comprehensive background checks for private sales of firearms, ABC reported. And Kelly said he does not believe an extended magazine is needed for those who have guns for sport. Gunmen have used high-capacity weapons in numerous shootings, including one at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, where gunman Adam Lanza had four weapons. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, is pushing legislation to reinstate a ban on assault weapons. A former Marine's passionate disagreement with Feinstein has garnered attention online. ""I own the guns I own because I acknowledge mankind's shortcomings instead of pretending like they don't exist,"" Joshua Boston wrote in a CNN iReport. ""There are evil men in this world and there just may be a time when I need to do the unthinkable to protect me or my family."" Facebook user Ellen Schmuker wrote in a CNN discussion that Giffords and Kelly's plan is ""foolish"" because ""all gun bans are going to do is punish law abiding citizens for the actions of lunatics."" But HoaiPhuong Nguyen took the opposite stance. ""No one is more qualified to head this effort, go Gabby and Mark,"" she wrote. CNN.com users weighed in on Twitter as well, with Susan Blumberg-Kason saying she considers the idea ""crucial."" 'We can't be naive' In their column Tuesday, Giffords and Kelly note that that gun violence ""kills more than 30,000 Americans annually."" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2009, 31,347 people died from firearm injuries. Nearly 60% were a result of suicide. Homicide comprised 37% of those deaths. Overall firearm injuries were down 2% from the year before. Giffords' remarkable recovery after being shot in the head has inspired many across the political spectrum. She told ABC she's doing physical therapy, yoga, and speech therapy, and working with a service dog. She has also been able to begin some outdoor activities. The tragedy two years ago thrust her and her husband into a new kind of spotlight. Tuesday marks a moment in which they are turning all that focus and attention -- as well as their passionate calls for stricter gun control -- into a political movement. ""We can't be naive about what it will take to achieve the most common-sense solutions,"" they wrote in their op-ed. ""We can't just hope that the last shooting tragedy will prevent the next. Achieving reforms to reduce gun violence and prevent mass shootings will mean matching gun lobbyists in their reach and resources."" ""We have experienced too much death and hurt to remain idle. Our response to the Newtown massacre must consist of more than regret, sorrow and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve fellow citizens and leaders who have the will to prevent gun violence in the future."" What do you think?

"Washington (CNN) -- Haitians being treated on a U.S. Navy hospital ship are requiring longer care than expected, forcing the U.S. and other international agencies to scramble for an alternative. The solution involves plans for a 3,000- to 5,000-bed temporary hospital on land, for continued care, because the ship is reaching its treatment limit, according to Gen. Douglas Fraser, the senior officer in charge of military operations in South America. The USNS Comfort, the Navy's hospital ship sent to assist in aid efforts, has performed more than 200 surgeries and treated more than 1,000 patients injured in the January 12 earthquake, and has been bolstering its medical staff to keep up with the demand. ""It's used up the clinical capacity before we reach the bed-space capacity,"" Fraser, commander of the U.S. Southern Command, said at a Pentagon briefing Thursday. ""The effort that we have ongoing right now for the discharge is looking to put together a facility where we have the ability to recover those patients -- and be able to provide them with that recovery space and time that they need,"" Fraser said. He said the initial effort would be to make a temporary facility on land the Haitian government has identified, with the facility consisting of tents and cots and whatever other resources can be scrounged together. Earlier this week the head of the U.S. military's aid relief in Haiti told reporters the military was assisting in getting together components of a large facility with 3,000 to 5,000 beds, to handle the health needs in Haiti. Lt. Gen. P.K. Keen said the U.S. military would provide medical equipment, but the United Nations is working with other aid organizations to staff it and contractors to build it. It's not clear where the hospital will be but military officials say it will be just outside of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Some patients discharged from the ship to continue care at home have no home to recover in, according to witnesses. Gen. Fraser said the U.S. government's joint task force in Haiti is working in a, ""very concerted effort"" to put the medical facility together. The U.S. Navy is also taking care of patients on three other ships -- the USS Carl Vinson, a aircraft carrier; the USS Nassau; and the USS Bataan. The ships are supporting efforts in other parts of the quake-ravaged country and are complete with operating rooms and dozens of hospital beds and medical personnel. ""We'll look to see how we can improve this better. But it's an ongoing process because of the magnitude of the need, the difficulties as we're working through the infrastructure to meet the needs,"" Fraser said. Fraser, talking about the cost of the operation, said he had not been placed under any financial limits. ""The focus is on meeting the needs of the Haitian people,"" he said. In response to criticism that there were still people who have not been able to receive food or aid, Fraser said he does not have an accurate number of how many or exactly where they might be. ""We're still having to move around and find those pockets for food distribution, and so it's really a communication and a continuing effort to get out to every spot that there is in the country,"" he said.","U.S., aid agencies scramble for alternative because ship is nearing capacity .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former linebacker Junior Seau's family sued the National Football League on Wednesday, claiming his suicide last May was the result of a brain disease caused by violent hits he endured playing the game, the lawsuit said. Last year, Seau, 43, committed suicide in his bedroom in Oceanside, California, with a gunshot wound to the chest, prompting speculation about whether repeated hits to his helmet over his 20-year pro career could have been a contributing factor. Earlier this month, Seau was determined to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative brain disease that can follow multiple hits to the head, the National Institutes of Health said. The lawsuit, filed in San Diego County Superior Court, accuses the NFL and helmet manufacturer Riddell Inc. of wrongful death, but doesn't specify a figure for compensatory and punitive damages. The suit also alleges fraud, negligence and concealment. The NFL could not be immediately reached for comment. Riddell Inc. has not yet seen the lawsuit and said it wasn't appropriate to comment on pending litigation, the firm said in a statement. ""We are confident in the integrity of our products and our ability to successfully defend our products against challenges,"" the company said. The lawsuit was filed by Seau's children -- sons Tyler, Jake and Hunter and daughter Sydney, all of California -- and Gina Seau, who is the mother of Jake and Hunter, both of whom are minors. Junior Seau's estate also is a plaintiff. ""We were saddened to learn that Junior, a loving father and teammate, suffered from CTE,"" the family said in a statement. ""We know this lawsuit will not bring back Junior. But it will send a message that the NFL needs to care for its former players, acknowledge its decades of deception on the issue of head injuries and player safety, and make the game safer for future generations,"" the family said. More than 1,500 former NFL players are suing the NFL, alleging the league hid the dangers of concussions from them. Seau was one of a string of NFL players -- along with Dave Duerson, Shane Dronett and Ray Easterling -- who took their own lives and were later diagnosed with CTE. Not everyone who is exposed to repeated head trauma would develop the disease, experts say. CTE can result in Alzheimer's-like symptoms such as dementia, memory loss, aggression and depression, but it can be diagnosed only after death. The suit alleges a long history of coverup by the NFL about the effects of the game's head trauma. ""The NFL was aware of the evidence and the risks associated with repetitive traumatic brain injuries for many decades, but deliberately ignored and actively concealed the information from the players, including the late Junior Seau,"" the lawsuit said. ""Today, the NFL and its agents continue to market the ferocity and brutality of the sport,"" the suit said. Seau played for the San Diego Chargers from 1990 to 2002, the Miami Dolphins from 2003 to 2005 and the New England Patriots from 2006 to 2009, the suit said. Seau was nicknamed the ""Tasmanian Devil"" for his on-field prowess. ""He was known as a warrior, the invincible patriarch who could be depended on to play through his injuries,"" the suit said. Seau suffered sub-concussive and concussive blows to the head in the NFL, sometimes lacerating his face, court papers said. During the mid-1990s, he began to show emotional instability and developed insomnia that afflicted him until his death, the suit said. He awoke at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. and couldn't fall back asleep. He became forgetful about discussions and appointments, and he was unable to concentrate or focus, the suit said. He exhibited ""self-destructive, aggressive and violent behavior"" and suffered extreme depression, withdrawing from his family and children, court documents said. His children ""would look into his eyes and not recognize the person with whom they were now dealing,"" the suit said. Off the field, his one-time ability to show good business sense dissipated, and he made ""impulsive, ill-advised decisions,"" the documents said. He drank to cope, ""entered a devastating cycle of depression and alcohol abuse,"" and became a manic, compulsive gambler in which he lost a ""significant amount of money in an attempt to make back business losses,"" the lawsuit said. Seau's family donated his brain to the NIH for research, and this month it released a statement saying ""abnormalities were found that are consistent with a form of (CTE)."" According to the NIH's pathology report, five researchers -- two NIH neuropathologists and three independent experts -- examined slides of Seau's brain, and all confirmed that there were signs consistent with CTE. None of the researchers was aware that the brain they were examining was Seau's. In a recent study, researchers found CTE in 34 of 35 deceased NFL players whose brains were donated by family members. A brain with CTE is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau. Under a microscope, tau appears as brown tangles similar to dementia. However, the Boston study showed this progressive, tau protein array in football players much too young for a dementia diagnosis, which typically occurs in people in their 70s or 80s.","Seau became forgetful, depressed, self-destructive, prone to drinking and gambling .

"(CNN) -- A 27-year-old mother surrendered her baby girl to firefighters in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve, authorities said Saturday. She told firefighters at Fire Station 46 that the newborn was just 6 hours old. The firefighters accepted the girl, wrapping her in a blanket. She was healthy and did not appear to have been neglected or abused. Firefighters named the newborn Noel, in honor of the Christmas holiday, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott. ""We are happy to state that our last report was that the infant was very healthy, and we are moved that this potentially tragic incident had a pleasant outcome,"" he said. ""There was a sense of relief."" Both the baby and mother were given identification bracelets. The infant was taken to an area hospital, Scott said, and would be placed in protective custody. In California, a parent or legal guardian can surrender a newborn at fire stations and hospital emergency rooms with no fear of arrest.

"(CNN) -- An April Fool's Day computer worm was launched on Wednesday but so far has not caused problems for the millions of computers that are believed to be infected. This piece of computer code tells the worm to activate on April 1, researchers found. ""I think joke's on us a little bit, which you would have expected with having an April 1 date,"" said Holly Stewart, threat response manager for IBM's X-Force, a computer security service. However, that doesn't mean the much-talked-about worm, called Conficker.c, is a joke, computer security experts told CNN on Wednesday. ""By no means do I think we're in the clear,"" said Paul Henry, a forensics and security analyst for Lumension Security, based in Phoenix, Arizona. On Wednesday, a master computer gained control of an estimated 5 million ""zombie"" PCs infected with the worm, experts said. Security experts fear the author of the malicious computer program essentially could do anything with those Windows-based machines. No attempts by the author to upload anything had been noted as of 8 p.m. ET Wednesday, according to Phil Porras, program director at nonprofit research institute SRI International. Conficker's motive is probably financial, security experts said. The worm's author could steal financial information, shut down Web pages, track keystrokes or send spam from infected computers. ""They have full administrative-level rights to run anything they want on all of the infected machines,"" said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer for F-Secure, an Internet security company. Experts who spoke to CNN on Wednesday said it's unlikely the program's author will launch any sort of attack Wednesday or Thursday. But they said some sort of issue is likely to arise in coming weeks or months. iReport.com: What do you think of the April Fools' Day worm? Experts urged computer users not to panic. The easiest way for computer users to see if they're infected is to try to access Windows updates from microsoft.com. If you can reach the site and if your system updates are working, it is unlikely your computer is infected, experts said. Further computer patches and information can be found at the Conficker Working Group's Web site. The worm does not affect Mac computers. A core group of about 40 computer analysts, researchers and policy experts is working to dismantle the worm, said Jose Nazario, manager of security research at Arbor Networks, and a member of the group, which some call the Conficker Cabal. Nazario said the group's unprecedented efforts may be one reason an attack hasn't happened. He said the April 1 launch date for the virus may have been a ploy by the program's author to get attention from the news media. Or it could be a twisted joke. ""Either way, it suggests an interesting sense of humor, I guess,"" he said. The worm allows a master computer to communicate with the infected machines through Web sites the worm generates. That function became active April 1, experts said, and allows Conficker's author or authors to seize control of millions of computers around the world. Infected machines are generating 50,000 URLs per day, which allows the master to talk with them. A previous version of Conficker created only 250 domain names per day. ""What happened now, today, is that the machines started pulling 50,000 domain names in 116 countries around the world -- so that's the change,"" said Hypponen, another member of the Conficker Cabal. ""The Conficker gang realized we could shut down 250 domain names a day, so they upped the ante,"" he said. Computer experts will continue to try to shut down the Web addresses that let Conficker's author communicate with infected machines, he said. Members of the Conficker Working Group have contacted security officials in all 116 affected countries and have shut down many active domain names, Hypponen said. Stewart, of IBM, said the sophistication of the worm is unprecedented. The situation has played out in the news media as an April Fools' Day joke. On a technology blog, The Washington Post mocked the hype about Conficker. ""Londoners woke up to find the iconic clock tower Big Ben stopped at precisely one minute till midnight,"" Brian Krebs wrote. ""The British tabloids blared that the giant timepiece had been felled by the Conficker worm."" The post ends with this statement: ""In case you haven't guessed it yet, APRIL FOOLS!!!"" Some have compared the situation to New Year's Day in 2000, when many feared the world's computers would crash but few problems were seen. Henry said that comparison doesn't fit. ""Y2K was a one-time event,"" he said. ""The update for Conficker has basically prepped it for its future. It now has the ability to gather marching orders in a way that, to date, we haven't found a way to block."" Little is know about Conficker's author. A piece of code in a version of the computer worm prevents the program from harming machines in Ukraine, leading some to believe that's where the program's author lives. Others say that could be a ploy. Many authors of previous computer viruses have come from Eastern Europe outside the jurisdiction of the European Union, experts said. Matt Watchinski, senior director of a research team at Sourcefire, a computer security company, said the author may try to split up pieces of the infected computer network -- called a botnet -- and sell them to bidders. The many unknowns about Conficker are what make it particularly concerning, said Patrick Morganelli, senior vice president of technology for Enigma Software. ""[An attack] could happen today, it could happen April 15, it could happen two months from now,"" he said. Henry says an attack will happen sooner or later.

"New York (CNN) -- A decorated U.S. Army soldier allegedly admitted he killed a 4-month-old girl he and his wife were trying to adopt, police said Friday. Pfc. Jeffrey Sliker was charged in the death of Laurne Clark, also known as Mollie Sliker, after police responded to a call from the couple's house on Wednesday, according to Julie Call, a court spokeswoman in Watertown, New York. Police say they found the infant with no obvious external injuries, but an autopsy later revealed blunt force trauma to the skull as the cause of death, according to Watertown Police spokesman Frank Derrigo. Upon questioning, Sliker allegedly admitted causing the injury, Derrigo said. Sliker's brother, James, says he can't believe his brother was responsible for the infant's death. ""I don't see him ever trying to hurt someone, especially his own daughter."" he told CNN affiliate WWNY. ""I just don't understand what happened. He's not the brother that I know."" The 23-year-old suspect earned recognition for meritorious service while in Afghanistan. He was arraigned Friday morning in Watertown City Court and is being held without bail. Sliker's attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. Sliker is expected to face a preliminary hearing in Jefferson County Court early next week.","A decorated U.S. Army soldier allegedly admits killing a 4-month-old baby girl .

"(CNN) -- Mad cow disease, SARS and now swine flu: Some diseases grab the headlines. But thousands of people worldwide suffer from very rare conditions, many of which few people have ever heard of. England's King George III may have suffered from porphyria, a disorder that affects the nervous system. From the Alice in Wonderland syndrome that might have inspired Lewis Carroll, to the disease that may have sent an English King mad, we take a look at some of these obscure illnesses. Morgellons . According to the Morgellons Research Foundation, crawling, biting and stinging sensations and the emergence of strange blue, black or red fibers from the skin characterize a disease that nearly 14,000 people suffer from, according to the Foundation. This is often accompanied by exhaustion, short-term memory loss, joint pain and changes in vision. The condition was named Morgellons in 2002 by a mother who believed her two-year-old son was suffering from the disease. The name comes from a 17th century skin condition found in France, in which children died after the emergence of 'dark hair.' However, there is much debate over whether the condition actually exists. In March 2008, the Journal of Dermatologic Therapy reported that most doctors believe it to be form of delusion, in which sufferers falsely believe they are infected with parasites. Consequently, the fibers in the skin are thought to be textile-based, picked up by oozing scabs resulting from more common conditions such as eczema or scabies. The U.S. based Center For Disease Control and Prevention recently announced it would investigate the disease after an increased number of inquiries from the public. See photos of people living with rare diseases » . Progeria . Progeria is congenital, meaning a defect or damage to a fetus. Sufferers of this fatal illness have a striking appearance resembling premature ageing, but die at an average age of 13. Profound growth delays begin at between nine and 24 months, leading to abnormal facial developments such as a disproportionately small face, bulging, prominent eyes and an underdeveloped jaw. By the age of two, hair from the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes is lost. The U.S. National Organization of Rare Disorders (NORD)says sufferers eventually lose the layer of fat beneath the skin and, in time, elasticity is lost in artery walls, leading to fatality via heart attack or stroke in 90 percent of sufferers. Water allergy . Known to have ever affected only 30 people, water allergy or ""aquagenic urticaria"" is extremely rare, but its existence has been confirmed by the Medical Review Board. Sufferers appear to be allergic to water. It usually occurs late in life and often as a consequence of a hormonal imbalance brought about by giving birth. A case emerged in the UK in April this year, leaving a 21-year-old mother unable to drink water or get caught in the rain because her skin develops a painful burning rash. She can shower for a maximum of 10 seconds per week and can drink only Diet Coke. It is not strictly an allergy but a hypersensitivity to the ions found in non-distilled water. Foreign accent syndrome . Sufferers of foreign accent syndrome inexplicably find themselves talking in an unrecognizable dialect. Only 60 cases have ever been recorded. Doctors initially dismissed it as a psychiatric problem, but in 2002, scientists at Oxford University, England, observed that sufferers shared the same brain abnormalities, which led to changes in speech pitch, lengthening of vowel sounds and other irregularities. According to the Journal of Neurolinguistics, sufferers don't necessarily have to have been exposed to the accent they adopt: their new voice is not, strictly speaking, a foreign accent, but the changes in speech often bear a striking resemblance to other world accents. The first case concerned a Norwegian woman in 1941, who developed a strong German accent and was ostracized from her community. Laughing Death . Laughing Death, more commonly known as Kuru, was exclusive to the tribal Fore people of New Guinea. The disease, which was characterized by sudden bursts of maniacal laughter, hit the headlines in the 1950s and drew in doctors from around the world. U.S. and Australian physicians observed men and women with shaking limbs, which subsided with rest, but a month to three months later sufferers would begin to sway and stumble, lose the ability to stand, become cross-eyed and lose the power of coherent speech before eventually dying. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke reported that tests on the deceased showed death had been caused by the emergence of holes in the brain, known as ""swiss-cheesing."" Eventually the U.S. physician Carleton Gajdusek worked out that the infection was being passed on through the village custom of eating family members after death. When cannibalism was eliminated, the epidemic came to an end. In 1976, Gajdusek was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) In 1938, when American Harry Eastlack was five-years-old, he broke his leg. The fracture didn't set properly, his hip and knee stiffened up and, bizarrely, bone growths developed on the muscles of his thigh. By his mid 20s, the vertebrae of his back had begun to fuse together. When he died aged 39 in 1973, he was able to move only his lips. He suffered from fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a rare disease affecting some 1 in 2 million people, in which the body's tendons and ligaments undergo a strange metamorphosis, essentially a transformation into bone. The condition is congenital and characterized by a malformation of the big toe that is present at birth. Eastlack donated his skeleton to research of the disease, and it is on display at the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia. The International FOP Association continues to research this extremely rare condition. Alice in Wonderland syndrome . According to the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine, sufferers of Alice in Wonderland syndrome perceive objects as being far smaller than they are. The condition, also known as micropsia or Lillliput sight, can also affect the sense of hearing, touch and perceptions of one's own body image.  Learn more about rare disorders » . The syndrome is associated with migraine headaches and named after Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, in which Alice goes through many bizarre experiences similar to those which might be experienced by a micropsia sufferer. The fact that Carroll suffered from migraines is well documented, and some speculate that his suffering may have prompted many passages in the work. Porphyria . Purple urine and feces make porphyria infamous, as does the fact that the ""mad"" 18th century English King George III may have suffered from it. Porphyria leads to complications in the production of 'heme,' a protein vital to red blood cells, and affects the skin and nervous system. Attacks lead to abdominal pain, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and constipation. NORD lists other symptoms including increasing sensitivity to the sun, itching and swelling. Increased hair growth on the forehead may also occur. Toxins resulting from the failed heme production can affect the coloring of other areas, especially after exposure to sunlight. Sometimes the teeth and fingernails can adopt a reddish appearance. It is these toxins that lead to the dark urine and feces. Mary Queen of Scots, Vincent Van Gogh, and King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon may have suffered from this disease. Pica . The magpie, Latin name pica, will eat anything, and so will sufferers of pica syndrome. Almost always pregnant women or children, sufferers develop an appetite for non-nutritive substances, such as paint, clay, plaster or dirt, or alternatively items that are more commonly considered to be food ingredients, such as raw rice, flour or salt. It can only be considered pica if the appetite persists for over a month and the sufferer is of an age where eating these objects is considered developmentally inappropriate. Medical researchers have tenuously linked pica with a mineral deficiency, but according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, experts have yet to nail down a real, firm cause or cure for this strange disorder. Moebius syndrome . Moebius is extremely rare, genetic and characterized by complete facial paralysis. Sufferers cannot close their eyes, look from side to side, or form facial expressions. Limb abnormalities such as clubbed feet and missing fingers are often also present. According to the Moebius Syndrome Foundation, most cases are isolated, with no notable family history, and sufferers go on to lead long and healthy lives. Family members often learn to recognize body language, posture and vocal tone as communicators of emotion, and sometimes claim they forget the person has facial paralysis altogether.","A look at some of the rarest diseases in the world .

"(CNN) -- Welcome to the brutal realities of English football Eden Hazard. Last summer, when arguably Europe's most talented youngster was bought by Chelsea for $50m, the future looked so bright. The newly crowned European champions made a blistering start to the English Premier League season, with the Belgian the focal point for Chelsea as they wowed critics and fans alike with some wonderfully inventive football. Fast forward six months and the 22-year-old Hazard, who earns a reported $270,000 a week, was reduced to kicking a ball boy as Chelsea's season took another turn for the worse. It had been a frustrating night for Hazard. For more than an hour he had tried but failed to get his team Chelsea out of a big hole as the London team desperately attempted to turn their season round in a cup match against Welsh side Swansea City. But when a 17-year-old ball boy decided it was time to engage in some time wasting -- he lay on the ball after it had gone out of play -- the red mist descended over Hazard . The Belgian, whose modus operandi as a player is more sumptuous flicks and stepovers than sly skullduggery, aimed a kick at the youngster's midriff. Cue bedlam. Hazard, who had previously never been sent off in his professional career, was red carded by the referee, South Wales Police briefly contemplated pressing charges and Chelsea -- not for the first time this season -- were facing a public relations disaster of their own making. ""The boy put his whole body onto the ball and I was just trying to kick the ball and I think I kicked the ball and not the boy,"" Hazard told the Chelsea website. ""I apologise. ""The ball boy came in the changing room and we had a quick chat and I apologised and the boy apologised as well, and it is over. Sorry."" Too late. The British media and social media website Twitter had already gone into overdrive. ""Football's fresh shame,"" was the verdict of the Daily Mail -- a reference to English football's continuing ability to attract the wrong headlines -- while Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand tweeted: ""I'm not the authorities but in my eyes it's a red for all those asking. Us players do put refs in bad spots at times unfortunately!"" Immediately after the sending off, Hazard did find support -- from Chelsea's official Twitter account. ""Has football gone mad? Hazard is sent off for kicking the ball under a ball boy attempting to smother the ball rather than return it,"" the club wrote on the account, which has over 1.79 million followers. However, Chelsea quickly sent a more diplomatic tweet: ""Apologies for earlier ballboy tweet. Hazard has now met with the ballboy and has said sorry."" If initially Hazard was condemned for actions, he also won plenty of support, with the ball boy -- reported by the British media to be the son of millionaire businessman who sits on the Swansea board -- coming in for plenty of criticism. ""After reviewing last nights footage, I've come to the conclusion that the games gone,"" tweeted Marseille midfielder Joey Barton, who has nearly two million Twitter followers. ""Ballboys aged 17, time wasting, then rollin round like ..they've been shot. Games gone. He was actually claiming to be best time waster in the world on twitter yesterday! What's that all about? ... Hazard only crime is he hasn't kicked him hard enough."" After the game Hazard apologized to the 17-year-old ball boy, who also said sorry to the Chelsea forward, though the Belgian is likely to be banned for a minimum of three games by the English Football Association for lashing out in the way he did. More woe for Chelsea boss Benitez . The ball boy furore is the last thing under pressure Chelsea interim manager Rafa Benitez needs just now. Hazard's kick and red card is just the latest in series of setbacks following the club's exit from the European Champions League and its dismal league form which has seen the London team fall 11 points off the lead, leaving Chelsea to focus on cup competitions -- the FA Cup and the Europa League. The Hazard incident overshadowed Swansea's achievement of reaching a first major cup final in its 100-year history after their 2-0 aggregate win over Chelsea. The Welsh club, which almost went out of the Football League 10 years ago, will now face fourth-tier Bradford City in the League Cup final at Wembley on February 24. ""Over two legs Chelsea had the ball more than us,"" said Swansea manager Michael Laudrup. ""That is normal, that is Chelsea, but today they didn't really have any good chances. We had some good chances. ""They had to score at least two but to be honest we deserved it. They didn't score once in 180 minutes. Minnow Bradford in fairytale triumph . ""What Bradford has done - there are no words. They have beaten three Premier League teams, it is marvelous. If I had a hat on I would take it off."" In the Premier League, Arsenal thrashed West Ham 5-1 at Emirates Stadium. Olivier Giroud scored twice, while Lukas Podolski, Santi Cazorla and Theo Walcott were also on target for the Gunners. Arsene Wenger's men are now four points off fourth place which holds the coveted prize of Champions League football. In Spain, Real Madrid booked its place in the last four of the Copa del Rey, despite being reduced to nine men during the 1-1 draw at Valencia. Leading 2-0 from the first leg, Real opened the scoring a minute before the break through Karim Benzema. Alberto Costa's 52nd minute strike brought the home side level before Fabio Coentrao and Angel Di Maria were sent off. Jose Mourinho's side will play Malaga or league leader Barcelona in the next round. In the night's other tie, Sevilla cruised past nine-man Real Zaragoza 4-0 thanks to two goals from Alvaro Negredo. Ronaldo inspires Real Madrid . Zaragoza lost defender Jose Fernandez to a straight red card after 26 minutes before Fran Gonzalez followed him down the tunnel 40 minutes later. Spain striker Negredo fired his side ahead after 36 minutes before Ivan Rakitic doubled Sevilla's advantage. Negredo netted his second from the spot before Manu del Moral completed the rout to set up a last-four clash with either Atletico Madrid or fierce rival Real Betis. In Italy, AS Roma claimed a 2-1 win over Inter Milan in the first leg of its Coppa Italia semifinal. Alessandro Florenzi headed home Ivan Peris' cross on 13 minutes with Mattia Destro adding a second. Inter pulled goal back just before the break when Rodrido Palacio latched on to Esteban Cambiasso's free-kick and fired into the net.

"(GameTap.com) -- The uncertainty that confronts consumers and investors in the U.S. is staggering. There's the price of gasoline, which creeps higher almost daily; a housing market that month after month gets gloomier and gloomier; and the conflict in Iraq that has cost the U.S. an estimated $3 trillion. Is it any wonder that the Consumer Confidence Index--maybe the most telling measure of how rank-and-file consumers view their economic health both present and future--is at a five-year low? GameStop executives thinks the Grand Theft Auto IV release could net them $100 million in one week. Shift for a second from the very real world of kids, homes, global conflict, and cars to the make-believe world of video games. There, at least for some, the economy that is breeding so much concern and trepidation seems a distant factor. Times are good, with double digit growth expected for sales of games this calendar year as well as for the hardware that's used to play those games. But even among the winners in the game sector there is one that stands to gain the most--the nation's biggest specialty retailer of games and game-playing consoles, GameStop. In a perfect storm of technology, demographic shift, and pricing, the retailer is bucking the general trends in the broader economy and stands to profit like it has never before. ""As we analyze our sales deployment, we can't find evidence of the economy affecting our business,"" company officials said recently. ""In fact, like we did after 9/11, we're seeing [comparable] store growth as consumers travel less and stay at home more, as well as trade in more games on new game purchases."" GameStop executives explained their enviable position, calling the present moment for them the outcome of the game industry reaching ""a transformative stage made up of many pieces, all of which have a profound impact on our business."" The company's financials tell some of the story: for all of last year, GameStop's sales increased 33 percent, same store sales increased nearly 25 percent, and profit for the company increased 82 percent compared to the previous year. ""By any barometer,"" one company executive said in a conference call with analysts, ""[it's been] another outstanding year for GameStop."" One industry analyst, Janco Partners' Mike Hickey, forecasts growth for the company that builds even further on those enviable figures. ""Accelerating demand for next-gen hardware including the PlayStation 3 should benefit comparable store sales in the [present] period,"" Hickey said of the company, who added it is not just demand, but broad demand which is fueling GameStop growth. Success for GameStop is ""highly attributable to video game play attracting a mainstream audience,"" with the demographic expansion having much to do with ""new consoles like the Wii, which pull back on the geekish complexity of typical content aimed at hardcore gamers."" But it's really the library of upcoming games that will supply GameStop with most of its revenue infusion in 2008. Hickey said today he expects that the release of Grand Theft Auto IV could net the company more than $100 million--in a single week. ""GTA IV...could ship 5.8 million units in the first week, or $360 million in retail sales and potentially $110 million for the Company,"" says Hickey. He said the game's publisher, Take-Two Interactive, is tracking higher than anticipated preorders leading to the game's April 29 release date. Another game which should help GameStop tally record revenues this year is the second expansion pack for Blizzard Entertainment's phenomenally successful multiplayer game World of Warcraft. The game has an active user base of 10 million, a chunk of which has already proven themselves interested in acquiring product extensions when they become available. The first World of Warcraft expansion pack released last year sold 2.4 million copies in 24 hours and 3.5 million copies in the first month, Hickey says. The game's second expansion pack, Wrath of the Lich King, is expected to be released in the second half of 2008 ""and should provide meaningful product sales over a considerably larger World of Warcraft subscriber base."" From every vantage point, the year is shaping up to be one of record-setting revenues and profit for GameStop--with more than just insiders noting the potential. Today on Wall Street, investors clamored for GameStop shares, bidding up the price just a nickel shy of $4, or almost 8 percent, to $55.66. Hickey, who is projecting that GameStop shares will top $70 in the next year, says investing in the company ""offers investors an opportunity to participate in the growth of the video game market with comparatively less operational volatility than publishers and offers [an investment opportunity based] on the remarkable success of the Wii and DS platforms from Nintendo.""

"(CNN)  -- It was a moment vividly depicted in the movie about her life: 7-year-old Helen Keller, holding one hand under a water pump as her teacher spelled ""W-A-T-E-R"" into her other hand. The statue of Helen Keller will be ""a wonderful addition"" to the National Statuary Hall, one expert said. In that moment, Keller, an Alabama native who lost her sight and hearing to illness as a toddler, understood that meanings were hidden in the manual alphabet shapes her teacher, Anne Sullivan, had taught her to make with her hands. The moment was shown in the play -- later made into a movie -- ""The Miracle Worker."" On Wednesday, a statue commemorating her 1887 breakthrough will be unveiled in the U.S. Capitol's National Statuary Hall, the first statue in the Capitol of a person with a disability, as well as the first of a child, according to the Alabama governor's office. ""It's always good to realize how much of an impact people with disabilities have made on the history and landscape of our country,"" said Nancy Starnes, director of external affairs for the Washington-based National Organization on Disability. ""I'm excited that they're going to be doing this. I think it's going to be a wonderful addition."" In 1997, a Franklin Delano Roosevelt memorial that opened near the National Mall drew complaints from disability advocates because its statue of the former president, who had polio, did not show Roosevelt in a wheelchair. In 2001, former President Clinton unveiled an addition to the memorial including a new statue of the four-term president sitting in a wheelchair. Keller, born in Tuscumbia in northwest Alabama, learned to speak at the age of 10 by putting her hands on Sullivan's mouth when she talked. She eventually graduated from Radcliffe College, then the women's branch of Harvard University, and became a prolific author and speaker who was endowed with numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She died in 1968. Since 1864, each state has been allowed to place two statues in the Capitol. In 2002, Congress changed the law to allow states to change their statues. Then-U.S. Rep. Bob Riley, now Alabama's governor, suggested that the state place a statue of Keller, and the state Legislature passed a resolution asking Congress to accept a statue of Keller as a gift. ""Helen Keller was an extraordinary Alabamian who showed us the power of a determined human spirit can overcome any obstacle,"" Riley said in a statement issued by his office Monday. ""The remarkable moment at the water pump, so vividly captured by this statue, will inspire countless others and remind them there truly are no limits to what people can accomplish."" A committee, with Alabama first lady Patsy Riley as honorary chairman, raised private donations for the statue and selected Utah bronze sculpture artist Edward Hlavka to create the piece. The 600-pound statue is made of bronze with a base of Alabama marble, Riley's office said. ""I hope we will continue to acknowledge that disability doesn't equate with inability in this country,"" Starnes said. She said there are many opportunities each year, such as Women's History Month, to recognize those with disabilities. ""Disability really is an overlay over any discussion about people in this country,"" she said. ""It's just time to take it off the shelf that's labeled 'special.' "" Andy Imparato, president and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities, noted that the statue will be seen by schoolchildren visiting the Capitol. ""She was a real pioneer, as a woman, as a person with a disability, as an educator,"" he said of Keller. ""We see it as helping to raise awareness that people with disabilities can do anything, and our history as a movement is a lot longer than some people assume."" Keller's statue will replace one depicting Jabez Curry in the Capitol Gallery. Curry was a Georgia native who served as president of Howard College, which later became Samford University in Birmingham. The Curry statue, which has represented Alabama in the Capitol since 1908, is being sent back to Alabama for display at the university. The other statue representing Alabama in the Capitol is of Joseph ""Fightin' Joe"" Wheeler, a Confederate general during the Civil War who, three decades later, volunteered to serve in the Spanish-American War at age 62 and attained the same rank in the U.S. Army. He was the only one of 425 Confederate generals to do so, according to a biography posted on the Fort Sam Houston Museum's Web site. His statue was donated by the state in 1925, Riley's office said.","Statue will be first in Capitol of a child, as well as a person with a disability .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will finally take questions from members of Congress on Wednesday about the deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. Lawmakers have long wanted Clinton's full accounting of the September 11 assault that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. They also want to ask her about diplomatic security, which the State Department has since re-examined at posts located in overseas hot spots. Agency officials have acknowledged shortcomings and promised changes. Some of the toughest questions before the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are expected to focus on the Obama administration's slow-to-evolve public explanation of the attack, which triggered an uproar in the middle of a presidential election campaign. U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice took most of the political heat as mainly Republican lawmakers seized on her public comments the administration has said were based on fast-moving intelligence that later proved to be incorrect. Still, some Republicans suggested the administration sought to mute the true nature of the attack to prevent President Barack Obama's political opponents from fully exploiting it in the final weeks of the November campaign. The issue was so polarizing that Clinton's decision to postpone an initial appearance before Congress in December due to health problems was questioned by her harshest critics as a possible dodge. It was revealed that she had a virus and suffered a concussion. Clinton was then hospitalized for a blood clot, only returning to work two weeks ago. Clinton's future health 'as good as her past' Her testimony will be public and will likely be the most difficult moment of her final days as America's top diplomat. Despite the controversy, Clinton's poll numbers remain high. She's leaving the job soon. Some of the potential questions she will face: . What did Clinton know? Republican Sen. John McCain wants a full explanation of Clinton's understanding of the attack -- what happened before, during and after. The 2008 GOP presidential nominee and the top Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain told CNN this week that he feels ""the American people were clearly deceived."" McCain told reporters eight days after the attack that he had information the State Department had been warned. In mid November, McCain took to the floor of the Senate and accused Obama of lying about the attack. ""The American people have received nothing but contradictory statements from all levels of our government,"" he said. The Pentagon released an official timeline that highlighted when Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and his senior commanders were first informed and when follow up decisions were made involving the military. The timeline shows Panetta and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey were told of the attack about an hour after it started. Both were on their way to the White House for an already scheduled meeting with the president. Thirty minutes later, Obama was directing the Pentagon to do all it could to help, according to senior Pentagon officials. Obama administration continues explanations of attack . What does Clinton know about cables warning of security threats? Just hours before the attack, Stevens sent a message to the State Department that referred to a meeting nine days earlier during which the commander of Benghazi's Supreme Security Council ""expressed growing frustration with police and security forces"" about security capabilities. That cable, since made public, is part of more than 160 pages of documents that paint a picture of persistent and unpredictable violence in and around Benghazi last year. It also reveals that the U.S. contingent in Benghazi felt it needed more security. In February, the regional security officer in Tripoli, Eric Nordstrom, warned that having just two diplomatic security agents on the ground in Benghazi made movements outside the U.S. facility impossible. ""I've been placed in a difficult spot when the ambassador tells me I need to support Benghazi,"" Nordstrom wrote in a February 12 e-mail to the regional director of the Near East Affairs Department at the State Department. Clinton's Benghazi statement . Was Clinton informed about the rise of al Qaeda-linked militants? In the September 11 cable, a paragraph refers to the ""expanding Islamist influence in Derna,"" a town east of Benghazi, amid reports linking ""the Abu Salim Brigade with a troubling increase in violence and Islamist influence."" The Abu Salim Brigade was prominent among the opponents of former strongman Moammar Gadhafi. The ambassador refers to another meeting on September 9 in which commanders of unofficial militia claimed that the Libyan Armed Forces depended on them to secure eastern Libya, and even supplied them with weapons. Read more about Stevens' warnings about militants . Communication from the ground up likely will be examined during Clinton's testimony. 'Talking points' cited by Rice and why didn't Clinton give that public explanation? Rice spoke for the Obama administration on Sunday talk shows on September 16. She made several claims that turned out to be wrong. The primary complaint from Republicans is that Rice's remarks were centered on anger over the anti-Islam film, ""Innocence of Muslims,"" when there was classified intelligence available suggesting a possible al Qaeda link. On the talk shows, Rice spoke from unclassified talking points officials said were provided by the intelligence community. She said the armed assault was spontaneous and linked to regional outrage over the film. Since then, Rice has twice talked to lawmakers about her remarks. In a statement, Rice said her talking points were ""incorrect in a key respect: There was no protest or demonstration in Benghazi."" ""While we certainly wish that we had had perfect information just days after the terrorist attack, as is often the case,"" the statement said. ""The intelligence assessment has evolved."" Obama defended Rice publicly, but she later withdrew her name from consideration as his likely nominee to replace Clinton at the State Department. Why has only one attack suspect been detained, and then released? Ali Harzi was freed earlier this month by a Tunisian judge overseeing the case against him, the country's state news agency reported. He was arrested in Turkey in connection with the Benghazi attack. On January 9, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland referred questions to the FBI, which she said ""has the lead on the Benghazi investigation."" The Tunisian news agency, TAP, reported that Harzi had been questioned by Tunisian authorities and the FBI ""as a witness and not a suspect."" But a U.S. federal law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the probe said he remains a suspect. The fact that Harzi has been freed from detention ""doesn't mean he's any less a suspect,"" the official said, adding Harzi does not appear on video taken of the Benghazi compound. Investigators have identified at least 15 people who may be suspects, the official told CNN, indicating some were identified on the video. ""We will get indictments,"" the official said. ""but it's not possible to put a timetable on it."" Reports on the attack . In December, an independent review of the Benghazi assault cited ""systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies"" at the State Department. Four State Department officials, including two who oversaw security decisions for Benghazi, were disciplined a day after the report was released. Clinton got a copy of the report and said in letters to State Department chiefs that she accepted its recommendations to beef up security and intelligence gathering in high-threat areas. Before the report came out, Clinton had popular approval ratings in nationwide polls. A December Bloomberg National Poll showed 70 percent of Americans had a mostly favorable view of her. Polls from Politico/George Washington University, ABC News/Washington Post and the Siena College Research Institute also showed high marks.

"(CNN) -- European champions Chelsea breezed into the FIFA Club World Cup final with a 3-1 defeat of CONCACAF Champions League winners Monterrey on Thursday. The English Premier League team's triumph in Yokohama, Japan set up a tie with Copa Libertadores winners Corinthians on Sunday. Goals from Spanish duo Juan Mata and Fernando Torres followed by an own goal from Darvin Chavez secured a comfortable victory for Chelsea's interim coach Rafael Benitez. Mexico's Monterrey scored a consolation goal in the 91st minute, striker Jesus De Nigris running clear and firing a low shot past Petr Cech. The win ensured Benitez will be taking part in his third Club World Cup final, having lost to Sao Paulo as Liverpool manager in 2005 before leading Italian side Inter Milan to the trophy in 2010. Benitez took from sacked former Chelsea coach Roberto Di Matteo last month. The Spaniard is battling to win over Chelsea supporters, with many still angry with the way fan favorite and former player Di Matteo was treated by the club's Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich. Chelsea opened the scoring in fine style after 17 minutes, Ashley Cole playing a slick one-two with Eden Hazard before cutting back for Mata to find the bottom corner with a curling shot. An early blitz at the start of the second half sealed Chelsea's place in the final. Hazard was once again involved, bursting down the left flank before cutting back for Torres, who saw his low shot deflected into the back of the net. Moments later Torres sprinted away down the same side and played a sublime pass to Mata, whose cut back was turned into his own net by Chavez. Chelsea can now look forward to a tie with Corinthians, who defeated African champions Al-Ahly on Wednesday in front of 20,000 traveling Brazilian fans. Monterrey will play Egypt's Al-Ahly in the third-place playoff prior to Sunday's tournament decider. Cairo's Al-Ahly qualified for the competition by winning the African Champions League despite football in Egypt being suspended following the death of more than 70 fans in February's Port Said stadium disaster.","Chelsea beat Monterrey 3-1 to reach FIFA Club World Cup final .

"(CNN) -- Two days before US Airways Flight 1549 crashed into the Hudson River, passengers on the same route and same aircraft say they heard a series of loud bangs and the flight crew told them they could have to make an emergency landing, CNN has learned. Crews successfully hoist the wreckage of US Airways Flight 1549 out of the water on Saturday. Steve Jeffrey of Charlotte, North Carolina, told CNN he was flying in first class Tuesday when, about 20 minutes into the flight, ""it sounded like the wing was just snapping off."" ""The red lights started going on. A little pandemonium was going on,"" Jeffrey recalled. He said the incident occurred over Newark, New Jersey, soon after the plane -- also flying as Flight 1549 -- had taken off from LaGuardia Airport in New York. ""It seemed so loud, like luggage was hitting the side but times a thousand. It startled everyone on the plane,"" Jeffrey said. ""We started looking at each other. The stewardesses started running around. They made an announcement that 'everyone heard the noise, we're going to turn around and head back to LaGuardia and check out what happened.' ""I fly about 50 to 60 times per year, and I've never heard a noise so loud,"" he said. ""It wasn't turbulence, it wasn't luggage bouncing around. It was just completely like the engine was thrown against the side of the plane. It just -- it didn't shake the plane but it shook you out of the seat when you're drifting off, it really woke you up. And when it happened again, everyone just started looking at each other and there was a quiet murmuring around the plane, and you could feel the tension rising just in looking. ""I remember turning to my [business] partner and saying, 'I hope you got everything in order back home, life insurance and everything, because that didn't sound good.' "" Jeffrey said he sent a text message to his wife about a ""scary, scary noise on the plane. Doesn't sound right. They're flying back to LaGuardia to check it out. I'll call you when we land. I love you."" He added, ""About 10 minutes later when we never made the turn, we kept going, that's when the pilot came on and explained -- I wish I could remember the words -- I remember him using air, compression and lock -- I'm not sure the right order, but he made it sound like the air didn't get to the engine and it stalled the engine out, which he said doesn't happen all the time but it's not abnormal."" Expert Aviation Consulting, an Indianapolis, Indiana, private consulting firm that includes commercial airline pilots on its staff, said the plane that landed in the Hudson was the same one as Flight 1549 from LaGuardia two days earlier.  See images from the rescue in last week's crash » . ""EAC confirms that US Airways ship number N106US flew on January 13, 2009, and January 15, 2009, with the same flight number of AWE 1549 from New York's LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte Douglas [International] Airport in North Carolina,"" Expert Aviation said in a statement to CNN. The company said it checked with contacts in the aviation industry to confirm that it was the same plane. The National Transportation Safety Board released the tail number of the downed Airbus A-320, which is N106US. NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said as part of its investigation into the Hudson River crash, it will be looking at all maintenance activities, but has no indications of any anomalies or any malfunctions in the aircraft, so far in the investigation. Following CNN's inquiry, he confirmed that the Airbus 320's maintenance records show ""there was an entry in the aircraft's maintenance log that indicates a compressor stall occurred on Jan. 13."" The Federal Aviation Administration referred CNN to US Airways. US Airways would not confirm that the Flight 1549 that took off January 13 was the same plane that splashed into the Hudson two days later. Valerie Wunder, a US Airways spokeswoman, said: ""US Air is working with the National Transportation Safety Board in this investigation."" She would not comment on any other details, including Tuesday's flight, though she did confirm US Airways is looking into it. Jeffrey told CNN that US Airways earlier Monday confirmed to him that the Tuesday incident occurred aboard the plane that crashed. John Hodock, another passenger on the Tuesday flight, said in an e-mail to CNN: ""About 20 minutes after take-off, the plane had a series of compressor stalls on the right engine. There were several very loud bangs and fire coming out of the engine. The pilot at first told us that we were going to make an emergency landing, but after about five minutes, continued the flight to Charlotte."" In an interview, Hodock said the pilot ""got on the intercom and said they were going to have to make an emergency landing at the nearest airport. But then, only five to 10 minutes later, the pilot came back on and said it was a stalled compressor and they were going to continue to Charlotte."" A third passenger, who did not want her named used, also said she heard a ""loud banging sound"" on the right side of the plane. She said she heard the pilot say the ""compressor for the engine was stalled"" and they needed ""to turn around and go back."" However, she said, the problem was fixed and the flight continued without incident. Pilots and aviation officials said that a compressor stall results from insufficient air getting into the engine and that multiple stalls could result in engine damage. However, the officials said, a momentary compressor stall may be less serious and could be corrected in flight by simply restarting the engine. A bird strike could lead to a compressor stall, the officials said.","Three say US Airways Flight 1549 nearly made emergency landing earlier last week .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When Rep. Joe Wilson yelled ""You lie!"" at President Obama, the South Carolina Republican's political team quickly launched an online strategy to capitalize on the incident. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, shouts ""You lie!"" during President Obama's speech to Congress. Wilson's heated outburst came on the House floor as Obama addressed a joint session of Congress about health care. Within 12 hours, Wilson media consultant Brian Donahue had sketched out a plan that included buying ads on Google, cutting videos on YouTube and using Twitter and Facebook to raise money and counter the congressman's critics. ""We knew that influencers and news outlets would want to find out more information about what happened and what Joe Wilson's response was, and they would be looking for this information online,"" Donahue told CNN. ""The events were happening by the minute and by the hour. Online was where we needed to be to respond and provide new information from Congressman Wilson. Traditional print media couldn't keep up with the pace of this issue."" At the same time, Democrats and liberal organizations seized on the incident to raise money for Wilson's likely Democratic opponent in 2010, Rob Miller. Leading the effort was liberal fundraising site ActBlue, which launched a campaign on Twitter and other social networks to raise money for Miller. Twitter was responsible for 11,000 clicks to ActBlue's portal for donations to the campaign online. While Miller wrote blog posts for Web sites such as the Huffington Post and Daily Kos, his campaign focused on the South Carolina press corps. National fundraising efforts were mostly left to outside groups.  Watch more on what happened after Wilson made the comment » . ""He really stayed focused on what he needed to do in South Carolina and what his plan was as a candidate,"" said Jennifer Crider, communications director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. South Carolina political operative Wesley Donehue handled the state and local political strategy for Wilson. The morning after Wilson blasted Obama, his campaign purchased Google AdWords, with search terms applicable to the previous night, that would lead searchers to the congressman's campaign Web site. ""The campaigns of both Joe [Wilson] and his opponent, Rob Miller, leaped to place AdWords ads on searches for 'Joe Wilson,' "" Google spokesman Galen Panger wrote in an e-mail. Panger noted that it was ""one of the fastest responses we've seen to date"" for an individual or organization to purchase AdWords after a breaking news event. Panger added that other political advertisers included the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, TheMiddleClass.org and the House Conservatives Fund. In addition, the Wilson campaign bought advertising on approximately 25 different Web sites including Google, Yahoo, Bing, DrudgeReport, Town Hall, Red State and a handful of sites with a South Carolina focus, the campaign said. Within 24 hours of Wilson's outburst, Donahue hired the David All Group, a conservative consulting firm known for its expertise in weaving together politics and social networking. By 4:07 p.m. ET Thursday, @CongJoeWilson, Wilson's campaign Twitter account, sent out its first tweet. ""Thank you all for your understanding and support,"" Wilson wrote. ""I'm on Sean Hannity radio now. Listen in."" Wilson also used Twitvid, a Twitter-based video sharing platform, to share information. Miller's first tweet went out at 9:54 p.m. Wednesday, moments after Obama's speech concluded. @RobMillerUSMC tweeted a link to the campaign Web site. Throughout the rest of the night, it updated followers with tallies of money raised and also linked to the ActBlue site. His official Facebook account was providing similar updates and increased by more than 2,000 ""fans."" The Miller campaign did not return several calls or e-mails to discuss its online strategy. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokeswoman Jessica Santillo, calling on behalf of the Miller campaign, said, ""The campaign does not discuss strategy."" As for Wilson, David All said the congressman has picked up 10,000 followers on his Twitter account and 16,000 new Facebook ""friends."" ""Twitter is not the end all, be all, but it proved to be another tool to help us achieve our online goals,"" All wrote in an e-mail. ""We used it to share information with influencers, help shape the debate, listen to the conversation as a real-time focus group to gauge our response, set the tone that we were fighting back with social media, and to essentially get our side of the story out."" Wilson's campaign team created three YouTube videos and released them September 10, 13 and 15. In total, the videos have been viewed more than 284,000 times. ""People needed to hear directly from Congressman Wilson,"" Donahue said. ""So we created Web videos which carried Congressman Wilson's responses, from him directly speaking to online audiences. These videos were quickly picked up by several major TV news outlets [and] had a massive impact online and on traditional mediums."" Miller did not use his YouTube account. As of Monday, the last video update made by Miller's campaign team was about a year ago. Barbara Dybwad, senior editor for the social media news blog Mashable.com, said the nation has reached a point where politicians need to factor social media into their strategic thinking. ""It leaves the candidate a choice: either engage [on social networks] or lose,"" Dybwad said.","Republican Rep. Joe Wilson drew fire for yelling ""you lie!"" at President Obama .

"(CNN) -- Two photographs of Madonna set to appear in a Christie's auction next month will probably sell for at least $10,000 each, according to estimates posted on the company's Web site. Christie's will auction a nude photo of Madonna (partially shown above) taken by Lee Friedlander. One, a full-frontal nude black-and-white photograph of the singer, was taken in 1979 by celebrated American photographer Lee Friedlander for a series of nudes he was working on, said Milena Sales, a spokeswoman for the auction house. Madonna was about 20 when the photograph, one of several, was taken. A handful from the shoot appeared in Playboy magazine in 1985, Sales said. Christie's put price estimates for the photograph at $10,000 to $15,000. The second photograph of Madonna was taken in the 1980s by Helmut Newton. In the Newton photograph, which is in color, Madonna is wearing a short dress and black stockings with garters. The circumstances behind the photo shoot were not immediately clear. The auction will take place in New York on February 12.","Christie's to auction Madonna photos .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate on Tuesday gave final approval to CIA Director Leon Panetta's nomination to become defense secretary when Robert Gates steps down at the end of June. Panetta's approval on a unanimous 100-0 vote was widely expected after the former congressman and Clinton administration official received bipartisan support during his confirmation hearing earlier this month . Senators from both sides of the aisle offered effusive praise for the 72-year-old nominee, who pledged at the hearing be a ""tireless advocate for our troops and their families."" In a statement issued after Tuesday's Senate vote, Panetta said he was honored by both his nomination and the unanimous approval. ""I would like to thank the Senate for the strong vote of confidence,"" Panetta's statement said. ""I pledge to them and to the nation that I will work to ensure that we continue to have the strongest, best-trained and best-equipped military in the world."" Panetta, who took over at the CIA in February 2009, served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton between 1994 and 1997. Before that, the California Democrat served as director of Clinton's Office of Management and Budget, a position requiring mastery of tricky fiscal situations and an understanding of the federal government's sprawling bureaucracies. Panetta also served in the House of Representatives from 1977 to 1993, a period in which he established deep congressional ties. President Barack Obama has nominated Gen. David Petraeus, currently head of the NATO International Security Assistance Force and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, to replace Panetta at the CIA.","NEW: Panetta says he is honored by the Senate's approval .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pilots at AmeriJet International have nice big planes, but nowhere to go. Pilots are shown picketing against AmeriJet International in a YouTube video. None of the cargo carrier's eight Boeing 727s have lavatories, pilots say, forcing the pilots and crews to use plastic bags for all their elimination needs. ""This is what you use for a Number One,"" one pilot says in a YouTube video, grabbing a small green bag. ""And a much bigger bag for a Number Two."" The video has become the most compelling argument in the pilot's public-relations arsenal ever since flight crews went on strike August 27. Pay issues may be their top concern, but the lack of bathrooms has had the greatest resonance with the public, striking workers acknowledge. ""Nobody can believe that there's no bathroom on a plane of this size,"" said Gordon Shaylor, a striking pilot who has flown for AmeriJet for 9 1/2 years. So at picket lines, and on YouTube, pilots have been hoisting the plastic bags, which the airline provides in lieu of a loo. ""It's degrading,"" said Dawn Leschinski, one of two women pilots employed by the carrier. The striking pilots say AmeriJet originally removed the plane's lavatories to reduce the plane's weight and the cost of servicing the restrooms. ""Initially, they didn't provide anything,"" said pilot and shop steward Kamal Patel. ""The bags that you see ... they didn't even provide those. Eventually they realized there were some corrosion issues when crew members had to go into the cargo hold to use the bathroom. So that's when they started to provide pee bags and bags to go Number Two."" Pilots say that the bags are fitted around a metal frame somewhat like portable johns used by campers. At the end of their flights, pilots dispose of the bags in an airport dumpster. Pilots also complain that there are privacy issues, since cargo handlers sometimes ride in the cargo hold, where pilots go to the bathroom. ""You just have to be real discreet,"" Patel said. ""You have to do it in front of everybody else."" An AmeriJet official declined to comment on the lavatory issue, or even discuss whether the planes have lavatories. A Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said lavatories, or the lack thereof, are not a concern for regulators. ""That's not an aviation safety issue. It's a passenger or crew-member comfort issue,"" said agency spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. ""There is absolutely no requirement for any aircraft to have a lavatory."" That includes large passenger planes used for cross-country flights, Bergen said. Nor does the Occupational Safety and Health Administration require lavatories on planes, saying aircraft do not fall under their jurisdiction. But one business industry group says lavatories should be a concern. Kevin Mitchell of the Business Travel Coalition, which represents corporate travel offices, called AmeriJet's working conditions ""worse than the sweatshops of the 1930s"" and said it is a safety issue. ""You cannot have these kind of conditions and have them compatible with safety margins. It just doesn't work that way. You need motivated employees with good morale that are well-rested coming up to work to fly these aircraft,"" Mitchell said. ""Poor morale among flight attendants leads to poor service. Poor morale among pilots can lead to something far more dangerous,"" he said. ""These cargo aircraft are flying in the same space as commercial passenger aircraft. These pilots are making split-second decisions on landings, on diversions, on crossing runways. And you want these people to be well-trained, well-rested and with high morale -- and that doesn't appear to be the set of circumstances at AmeriJet,"" Mitchell said. Pilots in the industry say the major cargo carriers all fly planes with lavatories, but several smaller cargo carriers have eliminated restrooms.","AmeriJet flight crews went on strike August 27, chiefly over pay issues .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez arrived in Havana early Wednesday for a new round of medical treatment, Cuban state media reported. The timing of his departure, weeks before regional elections in Venezuela, has fueled renewed speculation about the president's health. It was unclear how long Chavez, who declared himself cancer-free in July, would remain in Cuba. ""Nobody should be alarmed. Nobody should worry. This is part of the treatment that the comandante has been following,"" said Diosdado Cabello, president of Venezuela's National Assembly and a close Chavez ally. Chavez will undergo several sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, state media said. The treatment helps prevent and mend bone damage caused by radiation therapy, according to the American Cancer Society. It involves breathing pure oxygen in a sealed chamber that has been pressurized at up to three times normal atmospheric pressure. Chavez underwent several rounds of radiation therapy in Havana earlier this year. The Venezuelan president repeatedly spoke publicly about his cancer battle, but he never specified what type of cancer doctors were treating. Members of Venezuela's opposition wished Chavez good health but criticized him Wednesday for a lack of transparency regarding his health and treatment. ""I think that he should speak to the Venezuelan people with transparency about what the situation is, what the scope of this treatment is,"" said Henrique Capriles Radonski, who faced off against Chavez in October's presidential election and is now vying for governor in Venezuela's Miranda state. ""This is how it should be in Venezuela, and you can see that it's like this in other countries."" Cabello defended Chavez and said such criticism was unwarranted. ""The president has been very clear with the Venezuelan people about the illness he has and how it has been treated,"" he said. Health rumors dogged Chavez on the campaign trail this year, but didn't stop him from winning re-election in October. From June 2011 to May 2012, he underwent cancer treatment in Cuba, raising speculation about his political future and about a possible successor, especially when he named 10 people to his inner circle of advisers, known as the Council of State. But Chavez declared himself cancer-free in July and went ahead with his campaign. Details of his health, however, have been a closely held secret, and some people who claim to have insider knowledge say the president is in much worse condition than he publicly lets on. The National Assembly on Tuesday voted to grant Chavez permission to travel to Cuba for the treatment, the state-run AVN news agency reported. Word of Chavez's trip to Cuba sparked debate on the streets of Caracas, the capital. Chavez used to appear much more frequently on national television, said Hedbert Cortes, a worker. ""Before he would talk on TV for hours. Now he's on less. I think this is because of his health,"" Cortes said. Andres Berroteran said he was hoping for the best for Chavez. ""That everything turns out well and he recuperates,"" the insurance analyst said. ""Like any human being, we wish him the best."" Chavez slams Venezuelan opposition after election victory .

"(CNN) -- In a show of adoration, a small group of Jenni Rivera's fans waited outside Long Beach Airport, as the plane carrying the music star's remains landed late Thursday. They greeted members of her family with applause and condolences as they exited the airport. Another group of fans gathered at an impromptu altar in front of Rivera's mother's home in Lakewood. A hearse ferried Rivera's body through dark streets, escorted by at least three police cruisers, to All Souls Mortuary, according to CNN affiliate KCAL. The singer was killed Sunday when the plane she was aboard plummeted from 28,000 feet, Mexico's transportation secretary said. The private jet crashed in a mountainous area 9,000 feet above sea level. The remains of Rivera's publicist and the plane's co-pilot have also been identified, said Jorge Domene, a spokesman for Mexico's Nuevo Leon state. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Two lawsuits against the company that owns the jet accuse the firm of lying about its links to a businessman convicted of falsifying maintenance records. Rivera had left a letter for her loved ones and gave instructions to her sister Rosie regarding the circumstances under which it should be read, her brother Pedro Jr. told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Wednesday. He said the letter stipulated that she did not want to be cremated, as the family had originally planned to do, and that the authorities should hand over her remains to her siblings. ""Jenni always had advisers who helped her to work and to make things right,"" he said. ""She prepared a letter about a month, month and a half ago."" He added that funeral plans had not been finalized but that a memorial would probably be held in Mexico. The accident report will not be ready for nine months to a year, the secretary of communications and transportation said. Rivera, 43, is mourned by millions of fans. She and six others were thought to be aboard the plane, which lost contact with air traffic controllers soon after takeoff. Known as ""La Diva de la Banda"" or the Diva of Banda Music, Rivera was a musical powerhouse with her Spanish-language performances of regional Mexican corridos, or ballads. For fans, the nickname captured her powerful voice and personal strength. In recent years, she had been working to break into the English-language U.S. market and was reportedly on the verge of a crossover with a sitcom inspired by the success of ""I Love Jenni,"" a Spanish-language reality TV show on Telemundo's mun2 network. Rivera sold 15 million records, according to Billboard, and had recently won two Billboard Music Awards, including favorite Mexican music female artist. In October, People en EspaÃ±ol added her to its list of the 25 most powerful women. CNN's Nelson Quinones contributed to this report .","NEW: Rivera's remains were repatriated to the United States .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Nelson Mandela's current hospitalization is due to a lung infection, authorities said Tuesday. Doctors were treating Mandela and he was responding to treatment, a statement from President Jacob Zuma's office said. Mandela, 94, was hospitalized over the weekend at a Pretoria facility but the exact nature of his ailment had not been released. Tuesday's statement said he had a recurrence of a previous lung infection. Mandela has not appeared in public since the 2010 World Cup hosted by South Africa. The former president gets round-the-clock care after abdominal surgery this year and an acute respiratory infection in 2011. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate spent 27 years in prison for fighting against oppression of blacks in South Africa. He became the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed from prison. Despite his rare appearances, Mandela retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation.

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Throngs of people banged pots and pans Thursday, as they protested government policies in Argentina. The massive march was the latest in a series of ""cacerolazos,"" protests named for the cooking pots participants hit to draw attention to problems they say are growing in the South American nation, including crime rates, inflation and political corruption. Many demonstrators said a key issue drove them to the streets: the possibility that President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner could push through changes to the country's constitution and run for re-election. ""The people got tired, they really got tired of the government's lies,"" said Arturo Feldman, a 23-year-old student who joined the protest near Buenos Aires' iconic obelisk. Demonstrators there packed a 14-block stretch on the city's central avenue, waving Argentinian flags and signs that said, ""Enough Insecurity,"" ""No to Re-election"" and ""Liberty."" It's a scene that's played out on the streets of Argentina's capital for months. And on Thursday, it went global. The sound of clanking pans rang out in a Miami-area neighborhood known as Little Buenos Aires. Other marches were scheduled in international locations including New York, London, Madrid, Paris and Rome. Argentina's La Nacion newspaper reported Thursday that protesters demonstrated in Sydney, Australia. Are you there? Share your stories, images and videos . In Miami, protesters waved signs that said, ""We are not afraid"" and ""We don't want a communist Argentina."" ""We are here simply to support all Argentinians,"" organizer Christian Ferreyra told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Protester Romina Daviani said a variety of reasons, including high crime and inflation in Argentina, had brought them to the streets. ""But above all, the need for dialogue,"" she said. ""We cannot express ourselves. If you express a different opinion, they pursue you."" Police estimated about 300 people turned out in Miami. The protests, which started in Buenos Aires in June, have drawn sharp criticism from supporters of the Argentinian president. Many took to social media on Thursday to denounce the demonstrations. Some decry what they call a right-wing push to defame the president or overthrow the government. Others say protesters have no clear message. Argentina's government has avoided directly acknowledging the protests. But on Thursday morning, Fernandez's official Facebook page noted that her country is a democracy where people are free to express their opinions. ""So the only thing I ask is that to each Argentinian, and mainly their leaders, let everyone really say what they think and what they want for the country, with sincerity. Nobody is going to be offended or be bothered,"" Fernandez wrote. ""Well, if there is a group that demands certain things, you have to take the lead and speak clearly. Now please, let no one pretend that I have become contradictory with my own policies, which I have defended since I was 16 years old, the policies and the country that I believe in."" Past demonstrations have been nonpartisan, but this time some opposition leaders have made their opinions known. Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri tweeted Monday that he planned to participate. Fernandez's popularity has been in decline since her re-election last year, due in part to economic problems. Officially, Argentina's annual inflation rate is 12%, but most analysts and consumers suspect it is much higher. In September, the International Monetary Fund gave Argentina three months to provide more reliable estimates. Thursday's protests come about a week after Argentinian lawmakers passed a new measure lowering the nation's voting age from 18 to 16. Some critics have said the voting-age change, a year before a key mid-term election in Argentina, is an attempt by Fernandez's party to garner more votes and increase the odds that lawmakers will change the constitution to allow her re-election bid. Many demonstrators Thursday said they would oppose such a move. ""The constitution should be respected, not be reformed,"" said Francisco Bugallo, who helped organize the Buenos Aires protest. Rosendo Fraga, a political analyst based in Buenos Aires, said that the cacerolazo protests will affect the country's political future. ""They will without a doubt influence the mid-term elections. ... There's a lot of time before those elections,"" he said, ""but this gives the opposition an opportunity.""

The discussions in the Gabonese capital, Libreville, come a day after the United Nations called on the C.A.R. government and rebels to end violence and turn to dialogue. Diplomats from the United States and Japan are expected to meet separately with Nassour Guelendouksia Ouaido, secretary general of the Economic Community of Central African States, a spokesman for the regional body said.

Josue Binoua, minister of territorial administration and decentralization for the C.A.R., told CNN that a meeting between C.A.R. President Francois Bozize and the rebel group, organized by the ECCAS, might also take place next week in Gabon, on Africa's western coast. The ECCAS has taken a leading role in trying to stabilize the situation in the inland African nation, where simmering unrest has prompted international concern. Rebels, angry with the government, have staged attacks in the past month, although they appear to have halted their advance this week toward the country's capital and largest city, Bangui. Central African Republic: Government officials, rebels to hold talks . The volatile situation spurred demonstrations last week in Bangui, with protesters urging foreign intervention to stop rebels from entering the city. The United Nations is continuing to follow the situation in the country ""with serious concern,"" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said in a statement Wednesday. ""We are calling on both the government and the rebels to focus on dialogue that can avert violence and lead to a peaceful resolution and respect for the Libreville Comprehensive Peace Agreement,"" he said, referring to a 2008 treaty. ""We welcome regional efforts to seek a political solution and to reinforce security,"" Nesirky said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's special representative Margaret Vogt is in close contact with key parties in the Central African Republic and the region, he added. Read more: U.S. diplomats leave Central African Republic . Nesirky said the United Nations was aware of reports coming from the region about possible negotiations between the government and rebels, but did not confirm they would take place. The U.N. Security Council issued a statement last week calling on all parties to refrain from violence against civilians, respect human rights and seek a peaceful solution. In a statement Wednesday, South Africa said it was also ""gravely concerned"" about tensions in the country. ""We demand that the armed groups immediately cease hostilities, withdraw from captured cities and cease any further advances towards the city of Bangui,"" said Clayson Monyela, a spokesman for the Department of International Relations and Cooperation. South Africa wants all parties to work toward a negotiated solution and welcomes the commitment of Bozize to do so, he said. Pretoria sent its defense minister to the Central African Republic on Monday to ""assess the situation,"" the statement added. The ongoing unrest has prompted the United Nations to relocate dependents and nonessential staff from the country and the U.S. Embassy in Bangui to shut down operations. The U.S. State Department said last week that its ambassador and diplomatic team had left the capital, but that the United States was not cutting off diplomatic relations with the turbulent African nation. Bozize last week asked for other nations' help in staving off rebel advances that threaten his rule. Bozize specifically called on France -- which ruled his country, then as a colony known as Ubangi-Shari, until it gained independence in 1960 -- and the United States to help ensure ""the rebels return home ... instead of destroying and killing Central Africans.""","Diplomats from central Africa, the United States and Japan are meeting for talks .

"(CNN) -- A British theater producer who was briefly jailed in Uganda because of his play about the challenges facing gay people in the African nation said Wednesday the case against him had been dropped. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda, where most gays and lesbians face physical attacks and are treated as social outcasts. David Cecil told CNN he was in the Ugandan court when the magistrate dismissed the case. Read more: Uganda lawmakers to vote on anti-gay law . Speaking by phone from Kampala, he said the magistrate told the court Cecil had complied with the investigation, and was clearly not afraid to face the charges. However, the magistrate said the prosecution failed to provide evidence to substantiate the charges, Cecil said. The charges themselves have not been dropped, Cecil added, but if the state wanted to reopen the case, the magistrate made clear it would have to start again from the beginning. Cecil said he was confident the state would not reopen the case. He said plans to stay in Uganda, where his family lives. Read more: Uganda bans 38 agencies it says are promoting gay rights . Cecil was briefly jailed in September after he was arrested on charges of ""disobedience of lawful orders"" for staging the play without authorization. His lawyer, John Onyango, said then that Cecil could be imprisoned for two years, if convicted. The play, ""The River and the Mountain,"" features an all-Ugandan cast, and tells the story of a gay businessman killed by his employees. It uses the life of its main character -- a young businessman whose friends desert him after his revelation that he's a homosexual -- to highlight the challenges of gays in Uganda. The character's mother unsuccessfully intervenes to ""cure"" him of his homosexuality, and his colleagues later kill him.

Late last year, lawmakers in Uganda were mulling a new anti-homosexuality bill that proposes tough jail sentences for consensual same-sex behavior. Amnesty International, which has urged the Ugandan parliament not to pass the legislation, says it ""would have lasting, harmful effects on Ugandans who are thought to breach its far-reaching provisions."" Parliament is expected to reconvene in February, the rights group said, after which it could decide to table a vote. Homosexuality is illegal in most countries in Africa, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism.

"(CNN) -- The United Nations announced Wednesday that it is temporarily relocating dependents and nonessential staff in the Central African Republic because a cease-fire with rebel forces is not holding. Their ""contradictory messages and their continued military offensive seem to indicate that they might be intent on taking Bangui,"" said U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq, referring to the capital city. The move ""is a precautionary measure to reduce our presence in the event the security situation further deteriorates in Bangui,"" he continued. In a statement, the spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon said the secretary-general ""condemns the armed attacks on several towns in the Central African Republic perpetrated by the coalition of rebel groups 'SELEKA.' ""These developments gravely undermine the peace agreements in place and the efforts of the international community to consolidate peace in the Central African Republic. The secretary-general deeply regrets the loss of life and population displacement caused by the fighting."" The developments came on the same day an Air France jet -- en route to Bangui -- turned around mid-flight and returned to Paris because of tensions in the country. The next flight to the African nation by the airline is scheduled for January 2. ""We are analyzing the situation over there by the moment,"" a statement from the airline said. On Monday, the U.S. Department of State, citing ""increased rebel activity"" in the country, warned U.S. citizens against all but essential travel outside Bangui. On Sunday, the department authorized the departure of nonemergency personnel in Bangui. ""U.S. citizens should review their personal security situation and consider taking advantage of commercial flights,"" the department said. ""Armed militia groups, bandits and poachers present real dangers, and the Central African government is unable to guarantee the safety of visitors in most parts of the country,"" it said. ""There have been repeated attacks on Central African and expatriate travelers in the countryside. Attacks in past months have occurred as close as 70 kilometers from Bangui. Poachers and armed men also pose a threat to game hunters in northern and eastern CAR. The Lord's Resistance Army poses a similar threat to hunters in eastern CAR."" The Lord's Resistance Army is led by fugitive warlord Joseph Kony, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court at the Hague for war crimes and crimes against humanity, stemming in part from allegations of vicious tactics to conscript children as soldiers and sex slaves in his army. Also Wednesday, French President Francois Hollande ordered his defense minister to deploy soldiers who were already in the country to safeguard the embassy in Bangui after a demonstration there, his office said. The order came after hundreds of youths gathered during the morning outside the embassy, where they threw pipes and stones at the embassy to protest French policies affecting the Central African Republic, witnesses said. France has a permanent presence of 200 to 300 military personnel at Bangui's airport under the mandate of the Economic Community of Central African States. The Central African Republic came into being after the French colony known as Ubangi-Shari gained independence in 1960. According to the CIA World Factbook, the government, led by a general, does not fully control the countryside.","NEW: An Air France flight turns around en route to Central African Republic .

"(CNN) -- With nearly all of the vote counted, the referendum on Egypt's new constitution appeared to be victorious early Sunday, according to unofficial tallies by the Muslim Brotherhood and the semi-official al-Ahram newspaper. The Muslim Brotherhood said its ""final results"" show 64% of the vote in favor of the constitution and 36% against it. Al-Ahram posted a similar outcome on its website, saying it was based on 98% of the votes counted. The official outcome of the referendum is not expected to be announced until later Sunday. Saturday saw a second round of voting, this time in 17 provinces largely loyal to President Mohamed Morsy and his ruling party. Voting at the more than 6,700 polling stations stayed open an extra four hours before finally closing at 11 p.m. (4 p.m. ET). The first round of voting a week ago took place in more liberal provinces like Cairo. But the referendum passed in that round with 56.6% of the vote, leading many to predict an even higher result Saturday. The Supreme Electoral Commission plans to publicize the official results in a news conference. Deep friction in Egypt's society and institutions accompanied the draft constitution since its inception. For a second week, clashes broke out Friday in the coastal Mediterranean city of Alexandria between Muslim Brotherhood protesters, who were supporting a local imam and Morsy, and opposition demonstrators. Stones were hurtled, leaving 77 injured, according to official news agency Egynews. Riot police intervened and fired tear gas, according to state-run Nile TV. Last week's confrontation was triggered by the imam's call urging demonstrators to back the constitution. Voting was tainted by allegations of widespread abuses. A coalition of 123 local rights groups that monitored last week's voting complained of voter intimidation, bribery, and other violations; the nation's electoral commission promised to investigate. Turnout for both weeks of voting was high. Security was tight, and voting happened peacefully. Critics of the constitution say it was passed too quickly. Liberals, Christians and other minority opposition groups say they felt excluded from the Constituent Assembly that drafted it and that the wording does not include their voices. They want a new assembly. Opposition members say the charter uses vague language and will not protect the rights Egyptians fought for in last year's revolution, which ousted former President Hosni Mubarak. Supporters of the constitution herald what they say is its protection of personal rights, especially its provisions on handling of detainees in the judicial system, which made capricious use of its powers under the former government. International rights group Human Rights Watch said the constitution ""protects some rights but undermines others."" It ""fails to end military trials of civilians or to protect freedom of expression and religion."" The rocky road to the referendum began when judges threatened to shut down the assembly tasked with drafting the constitution. Morsy then issued an edict in late November declaring all of his past and present decisions immune from judicial review until the holding of the constitutional referendum. He also sacked the head of the judiciary, which had many members who were still loyal to Mubarak. The Islamist president's opposition saw the exceptional moves as a grab for dictatorial powers and poured into the streets, converting Tahrir Square in central Cairo back into the center of public discontent it had been during the uprising that brought down Mubarak. Morsy dropped his decree, but the situation remained tense. Violence raged, producing incidents that have raised the ire of international human rights groups, though these have not been systematic, as was the case under the former government. The outcome of the election is important to the stability of volatile North Africa and the Middle East -- where Egypt is a key player.","The Muslim Brotherhood says 64% of the vote was in favor .

"(CNN) -- South African icon Nelson Mandela was in good spirits on Christmas, even though he was in the hospital, President Jacob Zuma said. ""He was happy to have visitors on this special day and is looking much better,"" said Zuma, who visited Mandela in a Pretoria hospital Tuesday. ""The doctors are happy with the progress that he is making."" Mandela, 94, has received round-the-clock care since an acute respiratory infection in 2011. He was hospitalized for a lung infection on December 8; and on December 15, he had successful endoscopic surgery to have gallstones removed. Mandela, the former South African president, has not appeared in public since the 2010 World Cup hosted in his country. The Nobel Peace Prize winner spent 27 years in prison for fighting the oppression of blacks in South Africa. He became the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed.

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Critics have traditionally had a field day slamming Davos as an event where the elite hop on their private jets to quaff champagne and pat each other on the back. Where nothing of any value (except to those present) ever occurs. And ten, or maybe even five years ago, they were probably right. Watch: Davos Live: All the action from WEF 2013 . But since then, business and governments have had a massive wake up call. And Davos is becoming a very different event. Social media has empowered people to hold business and leaders accountable and to sanction and even remove those who behave in the wrong way. Read more: How Davos can become less self-absorbed and more useful . We are now living in the ""age of damage."" Every week we see a new example of this -- from BP to News International, from Walmart to Starbucks, from the BBC to Foxconn to Libor. As Unilever CEO Paul Polman -- who chose the 2010 World Economic Forum as the venue to launch his plan to double Unilever's revenue while halving its carbon footprint -- said in an interview recently: ""The consumer is able to identify responsible businesses from less responsible businesses. The pressure is higher but if you then deliver you will be rewarded more."" The new price of doing well is doing good and Polman seems to have the proof. ""Unilever has one of its fastest growth rates now,"" he said. ""We have just passed the â‚¬50 billion barrier --since 2011 we have created a Heinz or a Campbell Soup in incremental turnover without affecting the bottom line.""

Barclays CEO Antony Jenkins is another leader who understands both the challenges of operating in this era of radical transparency, and the power of social media. At the One Young World Summit in October he told delegates about the screen in his office that carried a rolling Twitter feed of tweets about Barclays. On the day the Libor scandal broke, Jenkins said it became an angry torrent, too quick to follow. Last week, he wrote to the 140,000 Barclays staff telling them: ""The rules have changed."" He unveiled a new approach for the organization where staff would be assessed on their adherence to a set of values that defines Barclay's overall purpose in society.

At a simplistic level, in the last century NGOs and charities had great intentions, but not always great execution. Businesses had great execution, but not always great intentions. This century needs to be about, and can be about, great intentions and great execution. Business can be a major force, in fact, the major force to drive positive change in the world. And Davos, with its unique ability to bring together NGOs and business, can play an important role in that transformation. But at the end of the day, actions speak louder than words. And all of us attending should keep that front of mind. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Jones.","Social media has brought greater accountability to business .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The 88-year-old white supremacist charged with killing a guard at the Holocaust Memorial Museum left a note proclaiming President Obama a tool of ""Jew owners,"" according to court records released Thursday. Writings attributed to James von Brunn and a biography appear on the Web site Holy Western Empire. James von Brunn remained in critical condition in a Washington hospital after being shot by other security guards at the museum Wednesday. A notebook found in his car after the shooting declared, ""You want my weapons -- this is how you'll get them,"" according to investigators. ""The Holocaust is a lie. Obama was created by Jews. Obama does what Jew owners tell him to do. Jews captured America's money. Jews control the mass media. The 1st Amendment is abrogated --henceforth,"" von Brunn wrote, according to an FBI agent's affidavit. Previous online postings attributed to James von Brunn promoted the claim that Obama has no valid U.S. birth certificate, a debunked theory rejected by U.S. courts and refuted by a certified copy of his birth certificate from the Hawaii Department of Health. A November 2008 post that appeared under von Brunn's name declared, ""There is no Obama documentation -- no records -- no paper trail -- none -- this is no accident. It is being done on purpose with Media help -- but to serve whom & why???"" Von Brunn has been charged with murder in the shooting death of museum guard Stephen Tyrone Johns, 39, and could face the death penalty. Von Brunn has been living with his son and his son's girlfriend in an apartment in Annapolis, Maryland. The FBI affidavit states he moved in about two years ago, bringing with him two rifles -- one a .22-caliber, the type used in Wednesday's shooting, and a .30-caliber.  Watch more about who is James von Brunn » . Scott Aulbach, the son's former roommate, said von Brunn ""didn't like anything about the government"" and ""was really prejudiced against blacks and Jews."" But Aulbach said he was ""floored"" when he heard the elderly white supremacist was the suspect in the museum attack. ""I knew the guy, and I heard some of the things he had said and some of the things he did in his past, but I never would have expected this to happen,"" he said. ""I mean, it's a tragedy."" But Jesse Demolli, who once exhibited some of von Brunn's paintings in his Maryland art gallery, said he was not surprised by the news. ""He was crazy. He was a lunatic. He was scary as hell,"" Demolli told CNN affiliate Bay News 9 in Tampa, Florida. He said about eight years ago, another gallery referred von Brunn to him. Demolli said von Brunn's paintings consisted largely of portraits of Native Americans. He hung about a dozen of the works for about three days, and said von Brunn called every day to find out whether anything had sold. After three days, he said, von Brunn accused him of not doing enough to sell the paintings, telling him he ""really needed money."" Demolli said he gave the man $20, which he immediately used to buy beer and cigarettes and returned to the gallery, where he quickly began to disparage residents of the surrounding neighborhood, which was largely African-American. ""Then he started talking about the gas chambers, and I said, 'Jim, that's it. That's it. Time out.' I told him to get out of my gallery, and I started taking his paintings down,"" Demolli said. As he removed the last painting, he said, von Brunn opened his jacket to show him a pistol. ""He said he really liked me and today is my lucky day, and he left,"" Demolli said. ""He was a crazy, racist man."" Von Brunn's ex-wife said she was in a ""state of shock"" over the shootings. The woman, who asked not to be identified, said she did not know about her husband's anti-Semitic views until ""a few years"" into their marriage, and said she ""was in total disagreement with his views."" She told Bay News 9 that his views were part of the reason their marriage broke up, which she said happened ""over 30 years ago."" ""I can't tell you what was in his mind. I have no idea,"" she said. Von Brunn grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, attended Washington University there and graduated in 1943 with a degree in journalism. He joined the Navy the same year, became an officer and served in torpedo boats in both Europe and the Pacific, according to Navy records. In July 1945, just before Japan's surrender, he became skipper of a PT boat. He worked in advertising after the war, and described himself as an artist before his arrest Wednesday. But by the 1970s, he had become a ""hardcore neo-Nazi,"" according to Heidi Beirich, a researcher for the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center.  Watch more about the debate over free speech and hate crimes » . Von Brunn served a federal prison term for a 1981 attempt to kidnap members of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, triggered by anger at what he called the ""treacherous and unconstitutional"" acts of an institution he called Jewish-controlled. David Gletty, who infiltrated white supremacist groups for the FBI, said younger members of the movement considered von Brunn ""a POW"" for his prison time. ""That's a badge of honor to these people,"" Gletty said. ""They look up to that as if, you know, if you're military, you get the badges of honor, like the Medal of Honor and so on."" Von Brunn's Web site promoted his book, ""Kill the Best Gentiles,"" in which he claimed the Jewish-led ""Illuminati"" and Jewish figures such as Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx worked ""to destroy Western civilization and the Aryan nation that created it."" Postings attributed to him on other Web sites declared both Christianity and the Holocaust ""hoaxes,"" and announced that ""Hitler's worst mistake"" was ""he didn't gas the Jews.""","NEW: Gallery owner calls James von Brunn a ""crazy, racist man""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The scheduled arraignment of a California woman charged with murder for allegedly pushing her 7-month-old boy off the fourth story of a parking garage was delayed Thursday, a district attorney's spokeswoman said. The arraignment for Sonia Hermosillo -- once planned for Thursday -- has been pushed back to Monday, said Farrah Emami, a spokeswoman for the Orange County District Attorney's Office. Authorities initially charged Hermosillo, 31, of La Habra, California, with attempted murder. But after the boy died Wednesday, prosecutors upgraded it to one felony count of murder and one felony count of assault on a child with force likely to produce great bodily injury resulting in death. If convicted, Hermosillo would face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in state prison, according to the district attorney's office. The incident occurred Monday at a parking garage at the Children's Hospital of Orange County. A witness saw the baby fall and called police. Investigators interviewed several witnesses and reviewed a surveillance video from the garage. The image of a license plate on a 2000 Chevy Blazer seen leaving the garage shortly after the incident led police to Hermosillo. Authorities found an empty child seat in Hermosillo's vehicle, according to a police statement. The baby had medical conditions that required regular treatment at the children's hospital, the district attorney's office said, and he wore a helmet for one of his medical conditions. ""Hermosillo is accused of removing the victim's helmet and pushing her baby from the parking structure with the intention of murdering him with the four-story fall,"" the district attorney's office said. She then walked inside the hospital, validated her parking and left the scene, the office said. ""Baby Noe,"" as the district attorney's statement referred to the infant, was critically injured and died Wednesday at the University of California-Irvine Medical Center. The district attorney's statement said Hermosillo has two other children.

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and website based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Cloning has been a controversial issue since German embryologist Hans Spemann first made a pair of adorable, genetically identical salamander twins out of a single egg, way back in nineteen-dickety-two. From tales of deformed baby animals to abnormally aging sheep, the idea of using science to duplicate and generally screw with our genetic material continues to creep out the public to this day. In order to put a heart-stake in this perennial bugaboo, we traveled to Texas to visit with Dr. Duane Kraemer, a leading researcher and authority on in-vitro fertilization, and the man responsible for the world's first cloned cat, which currently lives in his back yard. Having grown up on a dairy farm in Wisconsin, Kraemer left for school intending to learn animal husbandry and take over the family business. Once he commenced his studies, however, he quickly became engaged in the world of assisted reproduction and left the farming industry -- though only partially. He is now a director of the Reproductive Science Laboratory at Texas A&M, where he also works in the College of Veterinary Medicine. Considered a leader in reproductive science, Kraemer was the first scientist to successfully transfer nonhuman embryos resulting in offspring. Kraemer is currently working on a project to genetically engineer livestock resistant to disease. While some folks may (and certainly do) take issue with this endeavor, Kraemer's view is that his work is no different from using selective breeding to produce superior animals. Kraemer approaches cloning from the perspective of someone who has worked in agriculture and who knows the hardship of having a bull who can't reproduce. But now he's armed with the technology to circumvent the problem. See the rest of Clone Farm at VBS.TV . During the visit, we were introduced to a few of his cloned animals: Dewey, the first of his cloned deer; Bruce, a bull created from the 15-year-old cells of a dead bull who'd been resistant to brucellosis, a bacterial infection that causes spontaneous abortion in cattle; and CC, or Carbon Copy, the world's first cloned cat, who has successfully given birth to several kittens of her own. Cloning and genetic tinkering both raise a slew of questions that none of us can answer. After shooting this piece, we're not sure we see any real difference between the ""cloning"" Kraemer works on and most forms of artificial insemination and selective breeding. While the technological aspect allows for quicker and more direct manipulation, at the end of the day, if you can raise a herd of cows resistant to something as nasty as brucellosis, why wouldn't you do that? That said, cloning your household pets so that you can have them forever is still pretty silly.","Scientist who cloned world's first cat working to genetically engineer livestock .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- A top Iranian general said government troops are ""ready to sacrifice our lives"" rather than back down in the face of protests over June's disputed presidential election. Iranians have held mass protests, such as this one on June 15, over the recent disputed presdential election. Gen. Sayyed Hassan Firouzabadi, chief of Iran's Joint Armed Forces, said Iranian soldiers were willing to die as they did in the brutal eight-year Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, according to the state-run Fars News Agency. ""Some may think that by protesting and chanting their slogans against us, we will back down, retreat and give up,"" Firouzabadi said. ""We are ready to sacrifice our lives, as we showed during the time of the Sacred Defense [the Iran-Iraq war]."" The government has cracked down on Iranians who protested the outcome of the June 12 election in which hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner over his chief rival, reformist Mir Hossein Moussavi. Moussavi called the vote fraudulent and his supporters took to the streets by the thousands, sparking clashes between demonstrators and government troops, and members of a pro-government paramilitary force. ""The military uniform, in the system of the Islamic Republic, which is the system of the holy Quran, is the uniform of the Prophet's faithful, Firouzabadi said. ""It is the uniform of service to the supreme leadership and the people."" Meanwhile, Brig. Gen. Azizollah Rajabzadeh, Tehran's police chief, announced the creation of a 50,000-strong constable-like force called the ""honorary police officers"" that will assist police units, state-run Press TV reported.

"Mumbai, India (CNN) -- Indian authorities received no warnings about the three deadly blasts that rocked Mumbai Wednesday -- the first major assault in India's largest city since the 2008 siege -- and so far, no group has been singled out for blame, the home minister said Thursday. The attacks at the height of the evening rush hour killed 18 people and injured 131, Minister P. Chidambaram said. Earlier, authorities had placed the death toll at 21. Chidambaram did not explain the reason for the discrepancy. Though suspicion fell on a homegrown organization known as the Indian Mujahideen, no one has claimed responsibility, the minister said. The government has been careful not to finger Pakistani militants, who were blamed in the 2008 siege in the same city that left 164 dead. ""All groups hostile to India are under radar,"" he said. ""We are not ruling out anything. We're not ruling in anything. We're looking at everyone and we will find out who is behind these attacks."" He refused to accept a lack of intelligence about the attacks as failure despite widespread anger of Mumbaikars who have witnessed carnage in their city too many times. ""Whoever perpetrated these attacks has worked in a very, very clandestine manner,"" Chidambaram said. ""It's not a failure of intelligence."" Some security experts, however, disagreed. ""I believe behind every successful attack, there's always intelligence failure and failure of physical security,"" said B. Raman, who formerly worked for India's external secret service. Unlike other countries in the West that suffered terror raids, India has not strengthened its systems to prevent recurrence of such incidents, Raman said. ""This shows there is weakness in intelligence and security systems,"" he said. Mumbai residents were quick to blame New Delhi. ""The government has failed,"" said Vinay Dhadda, a Mumabi diamond merchant. ""Security systems do not inspire confidence,"" said textiles trader Puneet Kumar. ""Our governments should have learned lessons from the past attacks, but they haven't, unfortunately."" The three blasts Wednesday evening occurred within minutes of each other in the areas of Opera House, Zaveri Bazaar and Dadar, all busy commercial hubs teeming with people. Forensic evidence collected from the scenes suggested that the attackers used ammonium nitrate with a timing device for the detonations, Chidambaram said. ""The fact that the three blasts took place within minutes of each other, separated by perhaps about 8 to 10 minutes, shows that it was a coordinated terror attack,"" he said. The bombings Wednesday brought back haunting memories in a city that has suffered from terrorism before, including the massive assault by Pakistani gunmen in November 2008. ""I want to tell you we live in a most troubled neighborhood in the world,"" Chidambaram said. He called the Pakistan-Afghanistan region ""the epicenter of terror."" ""We're neighbors,"" he said. ""Living in the most troubled neighborhood, every part of India is vulnerable."" For its part, Pakistan issued a statement condemning Wednesday's attack and expressing ""distress on the loss of lives and injuries."" Chidambaram said the attack was aimed squarely at India. ""When an incident like this happens, let me assure you it is not targeted to any foreigners. The target is India's unity, integrity and prosperity,"" he said. ""There are elements hostile to India and do not wish India to grow and prosper."" After the blast, forensic experts and security forces using sniffer dogs pored over the bloody scenes, hunting for evidence. Police hosed down burning debris in the streets. People tried to comfort traumatized survivors. The area in Dadar is near a train station used by millions of commuters. On July 11, 2006, a series of seven explosions killed at least 174 people on crowded Mumbai commuter trains and stations. ""The sound was absolutely deafening,"" said Hemant Mehta who was in the Opera House area, near a diamond market that serves as a small epicenter of the city's economy. ""People ran and panicked. Words are insufficient to describe (the scene)."" Zaveri Bazaar is near a well-known Hindu temple, in which some people were injured, Mumbai police representative Nisar Tamboli told CNN-IBN. Zaveri Bazaar was one of the scenes of a twin bombing in 2003 that killed 54 people and it also came under attack in the 1993 bombings that left 257 dead. Wednesday's attack was the first since the 2008 terrorist siege on the city's main train station, two luxury hotels and a Jewish cultural center. Mumbaikars said the targeting of such congested areas meant that the blasts were intended to inflict high casualties. Thursday morning, as authorities tried to piece together the latest tragedy, daily life in Mumbai's unaffected areas resumed as usual -- millions of people rushing to schools, jobs, train stations. The city remained under a high security alert. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","NEW: An expert blames Indian security failures .

"(CNN) -- Ethiopia had waited 31 years for this moment -- and its football players didn't disappoint as it produced an impressive performance to take a point from defending champion Zambia. Forced to play with 10-men for much of the contest following the dismissal of goalkeeper Jemal Tassew, Ethiopia overcame a first-half penalty miss and a Collins Mbesuma goal to claim a 1-1 draw. Adane Girma's 65th minute strike sparked wild celebrations amongst the Walya Antelopes' fans and coach Sewnet Bishaw was left delighted with his team's performance. Ibrahim eyes Africa Cup of Nations chance . ""I'm happy as we missed a penalty and drew. This is our first experience after 31 years so, as you see, it was fantastic for our football,"" he told reporters. ""The players have shown their characters, and shown the rest of the world they can play football. ""The goalkeeper also has to defend, he went to defend the ball, and shouldn't have been red carded."" Ethiopia should have been ahead even by the time Tassew had been sent off for a reckless challenge on Chisamba Lungu 10 minutes before the break. Mourinho mentors Cape Verde's 'Special One' Playing against a Zambia side consisting of 10 of the 11 which had won the competition in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea last year, Ethiopia started in impressive fashion and came agonizingly close to scoring. Ahmed Said raced through on goal and lifted the ball over the on rushing Kennedy Mweene but the ball somehow bounced over the crossbar. Buoyed by a vociferous following, Ethiopia continued to threaten and had the perfect opportunity to take the lead on 23 minutes when Said was fouled inside the penalty area by Lungu. But the striker appeared to lose his nerve at the crucial moment as his effort was easily dealt with by Mweene. That miss looked to have taken the momentum out of Ethiopia's sails and it was left firmly on the back foot 12 minuets later as Tassew was shown a straight red card after taking out Lungu in dangerous fashion. Africa Cup of Nations 2013: The teams . Slowly but surely, Zambia began to take the upper hand and it was no surprise when Mbesuma took Isaac Chansa's headed pass in his stride before firing home from close range. But Ethiopia was not to be denied, and despite enduring a barrage of pressure, it fought back to equalize with 25 minutes remaining. Substitute Addis Hintsa picked out Said and it was his pass which allowed captain Girma to fire home at the near post past Mweene to seal a point. Mbesuma came close to stealing a winner for Zambia but coach Herve Renard admitted his team were fortunate not to lose following a disappointing display. Mali grab first win of Africa Cup of Nations . He told reporters: ""First of all I would like to congratulate Ethiopia for a very good performance. ""I'm not surprised -- I said be careful of this team, they are able to play very good football. ""Today, we have to thank our goalkeeper -- without Kennedy Mweene it could have been a very, very bad result. ""Our fans expected more than we did today, and they are right. Today, it was the fault of the coach. I did not prepare the team well to start the competition -- we'll see how things go after the third game. Nigeria held . In Group C's other game, Nigeria conceded a 94th minute equalizer as Burkina Faso grabbed a 1-1 draw. Emmanuel Emenike's 22nd minute strike had put the Super Eagles ahead and it looked on course for victory until defender Efe Ambrose was shown a second yellow card with 16 minutes remaining. And with just seconds remaining, Alain Traore rounded off a a wonderful counter-attack to steal a point and leave Nigeria stunned. ""All four teams have one point so everything is open,"" Burkina Faso coach Paul Put told reporters. ""The performance today showed who Burkina are -- we have quality in the team. ""We were missing some key players so I am very proud of what we did. I was confident of getting a point against Nigeria. ""This was a very good result for us and I am looking forward to the second game against Ethiopia."" Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi, who won the competition as a player in 1994, insists the disappointing of failing to close out the game will not affect his players. He told reporters: ""I am not going to let anything bring us down. I'm very proud of the boys, who did everything I wanted of them. ""This game is gone and the next game against Zambia is very, very important. I'll pick up the players and motivate them.""","Ethiopia marked return to Africa Cup of Nations with 1-1 draw against Zambia .

"(CNN) -- Jacques Chirac is the former French president best known for his staunch opposition to the war in Iraq -- a position that put him at odds with his U.S. counterpart, George W. Bush. But the 79-year-old's reputation as a career politician, one of a handful who dominated the French political scene for decades, is now tainted by his conviction on corruption charges. Chirac was born in Paris in 1932, the son of a bank worker. He studied in his home city, and at Harvard University's summer school, before taking up a career in the civil service. He was elected to France's parliament, the National Assembly, in 1967 and served as minister for agriculture and minister of the interior before being named as prime minister in 1974. He held the role for two years before personal and professional differences with then-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing prompted him to resign. After leaving office he formed a new political party, Rally for the Republic (RPR). A year later, in 1977, he was elected mayor of Paris -- it is from his time in this position that the embezzlement charges he was found guilty of on Thursday stem. He campaigned for the presidency in 1981, but he and Giscard d'Estaing split the conservative vote, and the Socialist Party's Francois Mitterrand won the election instead. Chirac was appointed prime minister for a second time in 1986 as part of a power-sharing agreement with Mitterrand, after a coalition of center-right parties won a slim majority in the National Assembly. After a second unsuccessful presidential run in 1988, he finally won the race for France's top job in 1995, beating Socialist Party candidate Lionel Jospin. In the run-up to France joining the euro, Chirac backed a series of unpopular austerity measures, which prompted strikes, and led to his conservative coalition losing its parliamentary majority in 1997, forcing him into ""cohabitation"" with Jospin, who became his PM. In 2002, he was elected for a second term with a landslide win over far-right politician Jean Marie Le Pen, after socialist candidate Jospin's shock defeat in the first round of voting. Weeks later, Chirac survived an assassination attempt when a neo-Nazi gunman fired a rifle at his open-top car during the annual Bastille Day parade. The French leader was a vocal opponent of U.S.-led plans to intervene in Iraq, threatening to veto any U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing an invasion of the country; when the coalition went ahead with military action in the absence of a resolution, he condemned the action as ""illegitimate and illegal."" His opposition to the war made him -- and his nation -- the target of criticism and even ridicule in the U.S., with French products and companies boycotted, and French fries replaced by ""Freedom fries."" While his stance on Iraq proved popular with some, both at home and abroad, other factors were hitting his approval ratings. In 2004 his former PM Alain Juppe was convicted of misappropriating public funds. Chirac, too, was accused of involvement in corruption, but he was immune from prosecution for the term of his presidency. The following year, riots broke out in the suburbs of Paris and other cities, prompted by anger at discrimination and high youth unemployment. In 2007, two years after suffering a mild stroke, he announced his retirement from politics; his longtime rival, Nicolas Sarkozy won the presidential race later that year. Chirac is married, with two daughters and a foster daughter. He is reported to be suffering from a ""severe"" and ""irreversible"" neurological problem, which prevented him from appearing at his trial.","Former French president Jacques Chirac convicted on corruption charges .

"(CNN) -- ""This is me and my daughter's first picture,"" a Los Angeles woman wrote on her portrait. ""I'll always remember this moment and cherish this beautiful picture forever and ever. I'm so blessed this was captured."" This response from a recipient of a free portrait at the L.A. Skid Row Rescue Mission is what inspires celebrity photographer Jeremy Cowart. His nonprofit, Help-Portrait, gives professional quality portrait photographs to people who could otherwise not afford them. Cowart, who has taken photographs of celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Tim Tebow and the Kardashian sisters, recruits other photographers, makeup artists and stylists to volunteer their time, equipment and expertise for a day. For the first time, Help-Portrait will share this year's photographs with the world a week after the event, through their website and the CNN Photos blog. ""Part of the beauty of Help-Portrait is that it's a movement that belongs to the people,"" Cowart said. ""All events are independently organized."" Each local coordinator determines where their community's event will take place, with Cowart's general guideline of helping people in need. The third annual event will take place in more than 50 countries around the world on December 10, with a new twist. ""Subjects will be encouraged to draw or illustrate on a copy of their photo and tell others who they are,"" Cowart said. He hopes that sharing these images with the world will allow others to ""join us in celebrating stories of triumph, reconciliation and new beginnings."" This year, many photographers started early, including Karen Lim, whose blog ""The Story of Bing"" won the 2011 Singapore Blog Awards Best Lifestyle Blog. She recently traveled to Swaziland to capture portraits in an underprivileged local community. ""The kids were very excited that they were going to have their photos taken,"" Lim wrote on her blog. ""Some of them rushed to wash themselves clean to look smart for their shot."" While she was there, Lim photographed a school for disabled children. She said she had to try to hold back tears with each photograph. ""But I burst into tears as soon as I started processing the shots,"" she wrote. Lim added that some of the children had disfigured faces and bodies from birth, others from abuse. Some would never see their photo because they were blind. ""Sometimes I feel like it's such a small contribution on my part. I know how to take pictures, and I was just taking some pictures for some people. But to them, it's a huge thing."" Luanne Dietz, a photojournalist and middle school photography teacher in St. Petersburg, Florida, said she has volunteered for Help-Portrait since its beginning. This year she has selected five journalism students to participate and partner with her and other professional photographers. The event will take place at the Mosley Motel, an establishment that houses 95 people; 57 are children. ""Not only do I have the opportunity to bring along some of my students to help who are from the very neighborhood the Mosley is in,"" Dietz said, ""but I also get to open their eyes to the power they have to change the world through their talent."" Her team has paired with the motel to provide portraits during a block party. Going above and beyond, they have set up a clothing giveaway, free back massage, a bounce house, free barbecue and a movie on the lawn at sunset. ""So often in photojournalism I feel that photographers get wrapped up in the news frenzy of 'report the facts and let the viewer decide how to help,' "" Dietz said. This year, she wants the photographers to be responsible for taking action. Across the world, recipients of these portraits express their gratitude. ""Katrina took everything from me,"" a New Orleans participant said. ""But now you are here to help me get something back, and I thank you for that."" Another in Calgary, Alberta, said, ""You made me feel like I was special, like a rock star."" The past two years combined, the group has given more than 101,000 pictures to people in places like nursing homes, homeless shelters and children's cancer wings in hospitals. ""It started with a simple idea,"" founder Cowart said, ""to give back with our skills and talent -- and it's blossomed into a grass roots, worldwide movement fueled by people hungry to give, instead of take, portraits.""","Help-Portrait gives professional portraits to the needy .

"New York (CNN) -- True love may be priceless, but does that mean we should pay through the nose for fine chocolate on Valentine's Day- or any day? The answer is unequivocally yes in the opinion of Rick and Mike Mast whose organic hand-crafted chocolate bars garnering rave reviews retail for $9. ""You get what you pay for,"" insisted Rick Mast, 34. ""For me, chocolate shouldn't be something you can pick up at the gas station for a buck or two."" The Mast Brothers are not gourmet chocolatiers -- the artisans who melt down large blocks of chocolate and refashion the mix into delectable treats of all shapes and flavors. Rather, Rick and his brother Mike, 31, are true chocolate makers in the tradition of Willy Wonka's oompa-loompas, though the towering, red-bearded Masts -- Rick is 6'4"", Mike 6'3"" -- could hardly be confused with author Roald Dahl's fictional Lilliputian chocolate workers. From a small store-front factory in the Brooklyn, New York neighborhood of Williamsburg, the Masts are producing an intensely complex tasting chocolate -- yes, just the way fine wine should deliver layers of flavor -- even though their ingredients are as simple as can be: cacao beans and sugar. ""We don't dumb it down so it's not as exotic or as sexy an experience,"" said Rick Mast explaining why he adds no milk fat, cocoa butter or emulsifiers. ""Chocolate should take you on a trip."" The Masts began producing chocolate in their apartments. Three years ago after maxing out several credit cards and investing their modest savings they turned their passion into a business that tries to live by an environmentally-friendly ethos. They purchase organic cacao beans from Venezuela, Madagascar and the Dominican Republic. To reduce their carbon footprint this year they plan to have a friend who owns a large sailboat deliver some of their beans. The beans are roasted in two convection ovens for about 15-to-20-minutes. Then the chocolate-makers pour the beans into a custom-made whirling, buzzing contraption that separates the husk from the nibs -- the meat of the bean that becomes chocolate. The resulting nibs go into vats where granite wheels crush them. Sugar is added and the mix is stirred until smooth. Pans filled with the thick pudding-like concoction then sit on a shelf for a month, to allow the full flavor of the bean to emerge. Finally, the cacao-sugar mix is melted down, stirred again and poured into bars. What results is a dark chocolate that tastes like so much more than chocolate: imagine chocolate infused with spice, citrus, and tea, except none of those is an ingredient. ""We're bringing out the different characteristics and the flavors people didn't think were imaginable from chocolate,"" said Mike Mast. For extra variety the Masts add coffee, hazelnuts, almonds, sea salt, peppers and black truffles to create additional flavors. A few of New York's finer restaurants, including Per Se, now offer Mast Brothers Chocolate on their desert menus and leading gourmet shops carry the brand as well. The Masts are shipping 5,000 chocolate bars a week and say they have 1,000 potential accounts on their waiting list. With a high content of cacao -- 70% to 81% -- Mast Brothers Chocolate has as much of the chemicals behind chocolate's mythical aphrodisiac qualities, the serotonin building-block tryptophan and stimulant phenylethylamine, as most any other bar. But, is it worth $9 for 2.5 ounces? I can't say it's the most delicious chocolate you will ever eat; it has none of the sweetness that lures so many of us to chocolate. But it likely will be the most interesting chocolate you may ever taste. And, after all to keep priceless love aflame we need to keep things interesting.","Chocolate shouldn't be something you can pick up at the gas station for a buck or two, says Rick Mast .

"MATURA, Trinidad (CNN) -- With its white sand and clear, blue water, Trinidad's Matura Beach looks like a postcard. It's a far cry from its recent past, when leatherback sea turtle carcasses littered the ground and kept tourists away. Suzan Lakhan Baptiste's efforts have turned a beach from a leatherback turtle graveyard to a nesting colony. ""Twenty years ago, this was a graveyard,"" Suzan Lakhan Baptiste said of the six-mile stretch of beach near her home. ""The stench was horrendous. You could smell it for miles,"" she said. Saddened and frustrated, Baptiste launched a crusade to help end the slaughter of the gentle giants. Today, she and her group are succeeding: What was once a turtle graveyard is now a maternity ward -- one of the largest leatherback nesting colonies in the world. It hasn't been an easy fight for Baptiste or the turtles. For 100 million years, the creatures have traveled the world's oceans, outliving the dinosaurs. Over the last 30 years, they have become critically endangered worldwide because of fishing, pollution and hunting. For centuries, they've been hunted throughout the Caribbean for their meat and fins, and also for their eggs, which some people prize as aphrodisiacs. ""Turtles are in serious trouble,"" Baptiste said. Every year, female leatherbacks make their way onto the beach, laying their eggs deep in the sand. It is a long, complicated ritual during which the enormous, slow-moving animals are easy prey for poachers. ""Leatherbacks [are] very vulnerable,"" Baptiste said. ""They cannot pull their head and flippers back into the shell. They have no sense of defense to actually protect themselves."" By the 1980s, nearly one in three turtles that nested on Matura Beach were killed. When the government asked for volunteers to help protect the endangered creatures, Baptiste and several others answered the call. In 1990, they started Nature Seekers, one of Trinidad's first environmental groups. 'Crazy Turtle Woman' For years, Baptiste and her group patrolled the beaches every night of turtle nesting season. She often walked alone until sunrise. Locals mocked her efforts, calling her the ""Turtle Police"" or ""Crazy Turtle Woman,"" yet her dedication to the unpaid work was fierce; when it conflicted with her day job, she quit and found a new job. Leatherbacks were a vital source of income for some members of her village, and the poachers who prowled the beaches with machetes could be threatening. When Baptiste's then-husband was injured during a patrol, she became more determined to stand her ground. ""I was very vigilant,"" she said, adding that at times, she even got into physical fights. But Baptiste persisted, and a prestigious award from the United Nations Environment Program helped validate her efforts. She and her group also worked hard to convince the villagers that using the turtles for eco-tourism could create a more sustainable income. ""I wanted to show that a turtle is [worth] so much more to us alive than dead,"" Baptiste said. Gradually, her message of conservation turned the tide of public opinion, and after nearly two decades under Baptiste's leadership, Nature Seekers has largely won its battle. Today, the leatherbacks' survival rate on Matura Beach is virtually 100 percent. ""Here, turtle slaughter is a thing of the past,"" Baptiste proclaimed. Even ""Papa George,"" a village elder who used to hunt leatherbacks with his father, can attest to the cultural shift. ""Suzan brought around the change,"" he said. ""They don't kill the turtles anymore ... because of the visitors."" Nearly 10,000 tourists a year, most of whom are Trinidadian, now visit Matura Beach, and many locals make a living by providing them with accommodations, food and souvenirs. Since the beach is a prohibited area during the nesting season, Nature Seekers' members act as guides, explaining the turtles' ancient rituals to visitors. In addition, Baptiste and her colleagues gather data on the enormous creatures, tagging and weighing as many leatherbacks as they can.  Watch Baptiste and her group weigh a leatherback turtle at night » . During peak season, they might see between 250 or 300 turtles a night. More than 5,000 leatherbacks nest in the area each year. The group's work is often cited as one of the most successful eco-tourism efforts in the Caribbean. Still, turtle slaughter persists throughout the region, and Baptiste is working to help other groups learn from her success, most recently on the island of Dominica. She finds joy in sharing her hard-earned knowledge. ""The passion that I feel, it burns me up,"" she said. ""I have seen the fruits of our labor, and it can happen in every community.""  Watch how Baptiste helped end the slaughter of turtles in her community » . Her efforts -- and those of many others around the region -- are making a difference. While leatherbacks are still critically endangered worldwide, the Caribbean population has begun to rebound. ""When I got started, a lot of people thought I was crazy,"" Baptiste said, and she admits that she sometimes wondered if they were right. Reflecting on what she and her team have accomplished, she now believes it was worth it. ""I love being crazy, you know?"" she said, laughing. ""Crazy with a passion, crazy with a dream -- totally environmentally crazy."" Want to get involved?

"My father-in-law lives in Fairburn, Georgia, just outside of Atlanta. When I told him that I'd be spending $350 for sushi, he burst out laughing at the outrageousness of the idea. But he didn't get to experience what was hands down, the best sushi of my life. I call it my re-education of sushi and the Japanese food aesthetic, for that's a more apt description of a dining experience at Sukiyabashi Jiro. I enjoyed sushi before I went to the restaurant. I just didn't understand it like a real Japanese gourmand does. The restaurant is named for its owner, 85-year-old Jiro Ono. He is a serious looking, bespectacled chef who wears hearing aids in both ears, a handicap he fears makes customers think he's aloof. Rather, he's concentrating on molding the rice properly, melding it to the fish just so, and serving it at the optimum time for the customer to enjoy it. As I take my seat before Ono, who stands behind the bar through the entire meal, what strikes me is how clean everything is. The fish must be lined up ready to go, somewhere, but it's out of clear sight of the customer. The counter is absolutely spotless; no wasabi, no utensils. You eat sushi the traditional way, with your hand, the way Ono has made it. ""Hai,"" says Ono, as he laid the first piece of karei, or flatfish, in front of me. The rice, slightly warm and separating evenly on the tongue, tastes lightly of vinegar. It's aromatic, but not strong enough to detract from the fish. Cool, but not cold, and astoundingly not fishy. It softly separates. Ono eyes me as I chew, smiling approvingly as I say ""Mmm."" A universal sound -- no need for me to bust out my favorite Japanese word, ooishi (which means delicious). As I finish that first piece of sushi, Ono is beginning to make the second, squid. A pause, enough for me to enjoy my first bite, and then the squid is ready. Our meal continues, with a back and forth banter of sushi chef and customer. In between, Ono explains temperature is critical, which is why he makes and serves the sushi depending on the eating pace of the customer. He then explains why there's no wasabi or soy sauce for the customer to add. ""Done properly, this is very tasty,"" says Ono, talking about sushi as a collective whole. ""But many sushi chefs just cut corners, so the flavor goes away."" Ono then bemoans the laziness of his fellow sushi chefs. I would take his comments seriously, except to look at how Ono lives his life, every other sushi chef must be considered lazy. Ono has been either training to be or been a sushi chef for more than 70 years, continuously studying the art of sushi. Ono's hands are barely wrinkled or discolored, because 45 years ago, he decided to always wear gloves outside of his restaurant. He doesn't eat onion, garlic, smoke, drink alcohol or coffee. The idea is that he must be a clean palette, because his hands touch the food that will go into his customer's mouth. Any imperfection in him is transferred to his sushi and interferes with his customer's culinary enjoyment. Not that Ono has reached perfection, he quickly adds. ""I'm always thinking of how to improve my sushi,"" he says. Is that attainable, I ask. ""Not yet,"" he replies. That personal dedication has won him accolades around the world, most notably from gourmet food guide, Michelin. Sukiyabashi Jiro won the maximum three stars, the only basement restaurant to win so many stars. Back at my re-education of sushi, I've come to my favorite piece so far: katsuo, or seared bonito. I'm truthfully not a fan of bonito, but Ono has seared the bonito, burning straw to create a smoky taste. Somehow, the fish is still cool in the center but barbequed on the fringes. The American glutton in me wishes four more pieces would follow. The tuna, as you'd expect, is melt-like-butter delicious. The uni, or sea urchin, something that usually ends up too fishy or bitter, is light and tasty. But the surprise was the last piece, the tamago, or egg. Ono has baked it so it's slightly sweet, but still recognizable as egg. It's almost like an eggy-pound cake. It's an amazing finish to the meal. ""Gochisosama deshita,"" I say, the traditional Japanese phrase said by the customer after a delicious meal. ""Arigato gozaimas,"" I add, for I am thankful and lucky. Not just for experiencing Ono's delicious meal, but for understanding a little more about the beauty of Japan, found in the subtlety, diligence and patience of one of its finest chefs.","Jiro Ono has been a sushi chef for around 70 years .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- NASA released newly restored videos Thursday of two U.S. astronauts taking the world's first steps on the moon. NASA hired a digital restoration firm to improve video showing astronauts taking first steps on the moon. The images were released just four days before the 40th anniversary of the historic event that captivated the world on July 20, 1969. The release, part of a larger Apollo 11 moonwalk restoration project, features 15 key moments from the historic lunar excursion, NASA said in a statement. Astronaut Neil Armstrong, now 78, was the first to venture onto the moon's surface after the lunar module Eagle landed on the so-called Sea of Tranquility. Following him was Buzz Aldrin, now 79. The videos are far superior to the initial dark, fuzzy images people watched on their television sets at the time, although they are far from crisp.  Watch a clearer view of ""one small step for man"" » . The original tapes of images sent back to Earth by Apollo 11 have been lost, and the camera that shot them was left on the moon, according to a NASA official. Given those circumstances, the team of Apollo-era engineers who helped produce the 1969 live broadcast of the moonwalk acquired the best of the broadcast-format video from a variety of places. These images were turned over to a firm specializing in digitized video restorations, said Mark Hess, chief of public affairs at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. ""It was the very best of the broadcast video that we were able to locate from all the sources,"" he said, referring to any place that had the original broadcast. ""The quality of those varied widely."" One source was kinescopes found in film vaults at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston that had not been seen for 36 years, NASA said. Kinescopes are the motion-picture records of a television program. NASA is fairly sure that the original tapes were placed in storage, and taken out and used in the 1970s and 1980s, Hess said. ""Once that technology became irrelevant, they were probably destroyed,"" Hess said. These are just the first restored videos to be released, he said. NASA expects that by September, the firm will have worked on the entire moonwalk, and the quality of those videos -- about three hours worth -- will be even better than today's. The company NASA used, Lowry Digital of Burbank, California, specializes in restoring old Hollywood films and video. iReport.com: Where were you during the moon landing? The images posted Thursday on the NASA Web site include a two-minute video montage with highlights of the moonwalk, and separate videos of Armstrong and Aldrin descending a ladder to the moon's dusty surface. Each partially restored video is shown beside an original image, for comparison. Another comparison video shows Armstrong reading a commemorative plaque on the lunar module, which says in part: ""Here men from the planet Earth first stepped upon the moon -- July 1969.""

"(CNN) -- ""I don't even know who the 'Blues Brothers' are,"" confesses Sheng Sushi manager Elwood Zhang. ""A lot of Americans come in and ask if we like that movie. I've never seen it."" It's really no wonder people ask. Zhang and his partner, James, who often goes by Jake, share the names of the movie's two main characters, played by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. The sushi partners also wear bejeweled black fedoras, which seems like an updated, bedazzled Shanghai nod to the 1980s cult film and ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch. Affordable sushi . Whether their names and uniforms are intentional, Shanghai's very own Elwood and Jake have amassed their own cult-like following among the city's sushiphiles. The two versatile chefs, both hitting 30 this year, have been running Sheng Sushi on Yongkang Lu for nearly a year. While the seven-seater hole-in-the-wall is tiny, their love of bringing many customers high quality and affordable sushi is anything but miniature. ""Of course we want to make a profit,"" admits James, who is head of sales and coordinates delivery with his Western clientele. ""But we'd rather make money by giving a lot of people something for cheap than selling something really expensive to a select few. ""With prices so low, we've met so many different kinds of people throughout the year: students, tourists, local businessmen and the like. I really like that."" Prices are indeed wallet-friendly at Sheng Sushi. Creative rolls start at the equivalent of about $3 U.S. (for the requisite California Roll) and top out at $5.70 for the Golden Dragon. The best deal: Helena Roll . Miggie Qin, a former staff member and current university freshman, is still a regular at the joint. ""I help translate on the weekends with the Western orders,"" the 19-year-old tells us while slurping on a $3 bowl of springy udon noodles with a delicately poached egg. ""But since it's summer, I've been here more often, helping beginners navigate the menu."" She recommends the Jackson ($3.75) and Helena Roll ($4.20). The Jackson is a fairly standard, though delicious, spicy tuna roll, pollock-splattered with a smoky spiced sauce. The Helena, Miggie's favorite, ""is the most economical,"" she tells us. ""It has tuna, salmon and flame-grilled eel. Three fish in one roll for only ($4.20)."" You have to admire her way of thinking. Other highlights . Other highlights on the menu include the Western Empire Roll ($5.25), which James describes as ""fruity and girlie."" Believing his sincerity when he tells us how much he likes his foreign friends and patrons, one just hopes that the roll's name is not an intentional slap in the face. Nigiri starts at $1.80 for three pieces of salmon or tuna, and soups begin at $3. Even when grabbing a couple of $2.70 Asahis or a few glasses of $3.75 Ozeki draft sake, diners will still walk out paying no more than $12 a head -- and incredibly full. If you're not lucky enough to grab one of their coveted seven seats inside or two outdoors, they deliver and provide takeaway. With plans to eventually open another location, nobody expects that these sushi brothers will be singing the blues anytime soon.","Sheng Sushi's Elwood and Jake don't give customers the blues .

"Editor's note: CNN agreed not to use the last names of the Iraqi families in this story due to security concerns. Safa'a had a 12-pound tumor that nearly took over all his body. Doctors in Iraq had given up on the boy. AMMAN, Jordan (CNN)  -- Two-year-old Safa'a gently holds his mother's hand, a 12-pound tumor bulging from his frail body. The tumor is nearly as big as he is. The Iraqi boy has come to Jordan for surgery with help from a most unlikely source: an 85-year-old liquor tycoon living on the other side of the world. ""There is a real chance that Safa'a may die during the operation,"" Dr. Iyad Sultan tells the boy's parents. His mother, Manal, cradles her son's hand as she trembles inside the King Hussein Cancer Center. His father, Mohammed, struggles with his words. ""We are afraid,"" he says softly.  See photos of Iraqi children being saved at the Jordan facility » . Safa'a was diagnosed in Iraq with Wilms' tumor, the most common kidney tumor in children. If caught and treated early on, the cancer has a high survival rate. But by the time Safa'a arrived in Jordan, Sultan says, it was a miracle the boy was alive. ""The tumor is massive,"" Sultan says. ""The liver, kidney, intestines are all squished to the sides. His lungs are very small. It's hard to believe he is able to breathe.""  Watch Iraq baby gets second chance » . The tumor prevented him from developing like other children. ""Sometimes when we see other children play, he starts to cry,"" his father says. ""I don't buy him certain toys like soccer balls. Because he looks at me and when he throws it far away, he can't go and get it. Even at his age, he understands."" Safa'a had received chemotherapy in Baghdad for a year, but the tumor kept growing, and doctors said there was nothing else they could do. ""You know, he is my first baby,"" Mohammed said from his modest Baghdad home at the time. ""I used everything I have to rescue my baby. I tried to do something, but I can't."" The boy's treatment in Iraq became even more volatile as sectarian violence flared. The family is Sunni, and the hospital treating Safa'a fell under the control of the Mehdi Army, a Shiite militia loyal to radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Traveling to the facility for something as simple as picking up the child's medical records became impossible.  Watch the struggles of getting help inside Iraq » . About 6,000 miles away, in Boston, Massachusetts, Safa'a came to the attention of Ray Tye. A liquor distributor and philanthropist, Tye runs the Ray Tye Medical Aid Foundation with his wife, Eileen. Their motto: ""We will never stop caring."" With the help of their friends, the couple formed the foundation five years ago after their son died of multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cell that is incurable. ""I found out that all the money in the world couldn't save him, but I did realize that money could save lives,"" Tye says from Boston. The foundation offered to foot the bill for Safa'a to travel to Jordan, even if the boy only had the slightest chance of survival. The foundation also is paying the medical expenses of at least three other Iraqis at the Amman cancer center. ""The mission is to bring people to hospitals who have life-threatening problems and don't have money. I don't care where they come from,"" Tye says. The Iraqi family then began the journey to neighboring Jordan. Safa'a is considered lucky to have a donor. Each month, about two dozen desperate Iraqis end up at the doors of the King Hussein Cancer Center with little or no money for treatment, officials say. See how you can make a difference . ""The center is almost the only beacon of hope for patients seeking treatment for cancer,"" says Princess Dina, director-general of the hospital's foundation. ""We said we cannot turn a blind eye to these patients. They are pleading, 'Please help.' So we cannot just ignore that. We don't have the millions to cover so many Iraqi patients, so we said let's try something else."" The scope of the crisis prompted the foundation to establish the Iraqi Goodwill Fund. It has raised more than $1 million and helped dozens of patients, but the need for such care far surpasses what the fund can do. For many parents, the knowledge that their children didn't have to suffer so much is often too much to bear. Iraq's decrepit medical institutions can't deliver even the most basic health care, and the emigration of skilled medical professionals means that many curable diseases inside Iraq end in death. ""In many cases, children come with diseases who have just advanced to a level that you can't give any curable treatment,"" says Sultan, Safa'a's doctor. ""If you saw the patients months earlier -- six, eight, 10 months earlier -- you can do many other things that now just aren't doable."" One patient is 2-year-old Mariam, who was born with an extreme and potentially fatal tumor on the side of her face. Her young mother, Rasha, 22, was deserted by her husband. She had to fight to get her daughter seen by a doctor in Iraq; the staff was too overwhelmed with the daily casualties. ""We tried to get her into a hospital in Iraq, and the doctor kicked us out,"" Rasha says. ""There was shooting and firing outside. We fought with the doctor; we fought to get her in. I lost all hope."" The tumor grew to such a mass, it displaced Mariam's eye, broke her jaw and burst through her scalp. ""I was watching my daughter die in front of me slowly, and there was nothing I could do,"" Rasha says. U.S. troops discovered Mariam, and through a joint effort with the Jordanian government, she ended up in Amman. Now, little Mariam gurgles at her favorite nurse. Small smiles play across her deformed face as her mother tickles her. Back in the operating room, Safa'a whimpers as his parents kiss him tearfully, fearing that it could be a final goodbye. ""We don't know what will happen when we open Safa'a's abdomen and we take this tumor out,"" the doctor says. ""Safa'a has a chance of survival definitely, if he survives today. So today is the most critical day in Safa'a's life."" The surgery lasted five hours, and the doctors called it a success. The massive tumor was removed completely. Safa'a's parents could barely express their happiness and gratitude. ""I cannot put my happiness into words,"" his mother says, laughing. The boy's father adds, ""this is such a happy occasion. You brought happiness into the hearts of parents."" Safa'a has a lengthy recovery ahead of him, but his parents know he is lucky to have a chance at life, thanks to the kindness of strangers. ""I will tell you the truth. Tears come to your eyes. You're saving a life,"" Tye says after hearing about Safa'a's successful surgery. ""When you look at somebody that had a life-threatening problem and you could, with money, save that life, you've got to sit back and say you helped make this world just a little better, and that's what it's all about.""","An Iraqi boy, 2, travels to Jordan to have 12-pound tumor removed .

"(CNN) -- A unified lawsuit on behalf of more than 2,000 National Football League players has been filed against the league in federal court, alleging that the NFL failed to acknowledge and address neurological risks associated with the sport and then deliberately failed to tell players about the risks they faced, according to attorneys representing former players. The complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, unites the more than 80 pending lawsuits filed against the NFL. ""I firmly believe the NFL could have and should have done more to protect Ray. That's why I am seeking to hold the NFL accountable,"" said Mary Ann Easterling, widow of former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling, who committed suicide in April after years with dementia. ""Having lived through Ray's struggle, I desperately hope and pray others can be spared the pain and suffering we have endured -- and still endure every day."" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy acknowledged the filing but added that there was nothing new to the claim other than that it merges them all. ""Our legal team will review today's filing that is intended to consolidate plaintiffs' existing claims into one 'master' complaint,"" he said. ""The NFL has long made player safety a priority and continues to do so. Any allegation that the NFL sought to mislead players has no merit. It stands in contrast to the league's many actions to better protect players and advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions."" However, many NFL players have claimed that they suffer from a variety of injuries because of concussions without really knowing the severity of how badly they could be hurt playing the game. ""The NFL must open its eyes to the consequences of its actions,"" said Kevin Turner, a former running back for the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles who has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ""The NFL has the power not only to give former players the care they deserve, but also to ensure that future generations of football players do not suffer the way that many in my generation have."" Lawyers representing the players cited ""dementia, depression, reduced cognitive ability, sleeplessness, early-onset Alzheimer's, and a debilitating and latent disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy"" as some of the specific injuries caused by head trauma in the NFL. ""Instead of protecting the health of its players, the NFL's response to this epidemic of brain injuries was to engage in a campaign of deceit and deception, actively concealing the risks players faced from repetitive impacts,"" said Christopher Seeger and Sol Weiss, co-lead counsels for the former players. ""This case is about providing security and care to former NFL players who have suffered these devastating neurologic injuries, and making the game safer for generations to come.""","The lawsuit claims the NFL failed to deal with neurological risks .

"New Orleans (CNN) -- Lee weakened to a tropical depression late Sunday, the National Hurricane Center reported, but not before dumping vast amounts of rain and causing extensive flooding in Gulf Coast states. The plodding storm had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph -- down considerably from earlier -- as it headed 7 mph in an east-northeasterly direction. Yet while it winds have died down, Lee remained a threat as it moved toward the Appalachians and points to the east and north, with its intense rains producing potential problems especially in already saturated areas. By Sunday night, state and local officials -- plus the Facebook page for Louisiana's emergency management division and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu -- had reported flooding in numerous Louisiana parishes including Iberia, Terrebone, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Tammany and Jefferson. Mississippi also was hard hit. A news release Sunday from its emergency management agency pointed to several flooded roads and damaged homes in Hancock, Harrison, Jackson and Stone counties. And the website for Entergy, a major utility in the area, showed mostly pockets of power outages as far west as the Houston suburbs and as far north as Arkansas. Centered over southern Louisiana, the storm continued to pump out rain -- as much as 20 inches expected in spots through Monday night, according to the National Hurricane Center -- as it chugged northward Sunday toward the Tennessee Valley. In an advisory, the center warned, ""These rains are expected to cause extensive flooding."" The storm had caused numerous headaches, but not the devastation of last week's Hurricane Irene, which killed more than 40 people and left millions without power. Nor has it compared with Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,000 people in Louisiana, Mississippi and other Gulf states six years ago. Robert Green was one of those directly affected by Katrina, which killed his mother and granddaughter and caused much of his house to literally float away. On Sunday, the resident of New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward tracked the storm and prepared for the worst. ""We're making sure that we keep up with what's going on with the storm, so that what happened in 2005 doesn't happen again,"" he said. ""If you live in fear, you don't live as well ... And you realize that you just have to be prepared and listen and move if you need to move."" In a press conference in New Orleans on Sunday afternoon, Landrieu characterized Lee as a ""very stubborn, persistent, slow-moving unpredictable event."" He noted that the storm, by then, had dumped 10 to 13 inches of rain on the city and brought wind gusts of up to 50 mph that caused minor flooding and prompted 60 calls to authorities for downed trees. Yet New Orleans is otherwise fully functional, with all 24 pump stations in the city ""100% operational"" and just more than 200 people without power, down significantly from Saturday, the mayor said. The mayor, though, warned residents not to be complacent, especially with continued tornado threats and rain bands that could dump between 2 to 4 inches at a time and cause flash floods. ""We're not out of the woods yet,"" Landrieu said. Other Gulf coast communities, however, have experienced more severe flooding. That includes the city of Mandeville, across Lake Pontchartrain, which was buried Sunday beneath feet of water. ""Normally there is a street here,"" said Gerard Braud, who sent CNN iReport videos from flooded areas of the city Sunday.  Mailboxes were barely sticking out over the water. In Plaquemines Parish, water pored over the top of levees and flooded parts of Highway 23, prompting its closure, the parish said in a news release. Rapidly rising waters also trapped some cattle, which survived after being steered to higher ground. Coastal residents knew the storm was coming, and many took precautions. ""We are a sturdy people. All Gulf Coasters are willing and able to weather any storm,"" said Andrew Kaile of Metairie, Louisiana, just west of New Orleans, in an iReport Saturday. In its 10 p.m. CT Sunday advisory, the National Hurricane Center reported that Lee's center was expected to move across southern Mississippi overnight and Monday. ""Little change in strength is expected in the next day or so as Lee becomes an extra-tropical cyclone,"" the center added. Over time, it is expected to dump considerable rain in the eastern part of the country -- including New Jersey, New York and Vermont, where grounds are drenched and rivers are already full after Irene. The hurricane center noted Sunday night that ""flooding rains (are) expected to spread from the Gulf Coast to the Appalachians."" ""It will ... be a long, slow trip through the Southeast into the Appalachians,"" said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. ""Heavy rain and inland flooding continue to be the greatest concern."" Lee ""is expected to connect with a cold front moving through the Great Lakes today,"" Jeras said Sunday.  ""This will bring rain up and down the Eastern seaboard on Monday and will cause heavy travel delays for most major metropolitan areas on the Labor Day holiday.  In addition, the cold front will bring 1 to 3 inches of rain to the already flood-weary Northeast, including Vermont and New York, that were hit hard by (Hurricane) Irene."" After being in effect for days, all tropical storm warnings for the Gulf Coast were discontinued Sunday night. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal had urged state residents Saturday to ""use extreme caution.""  He noted that some roads were already flooded. Ten parishes issued emergency declarations and called on residents to pay attention to weather advisories and flood warnings. In Alabama, officials shut the Port of Mobile due to rough seas. By Sunday afternoon, water levels were as high as 2 to 4 feet above ground level over parts of the Louisiana coast, and up to 3 feet above ground level along the Mississippi and Alabama coasts, the hurricane center said. A storm surge of more than 2 feet was recorded just south of Morgan City, Louisiana, at Amerada Pass, the center said. The storm forced oil and gas producers to halt operations in the region amid threats of flooding in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Some energy producers evacuated employees ahead of the storm. About 60% of oil production in the Gulf and more than half of natural gas production have been shut down, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. CNN's Chris Welch contributed to this report.","NEW: Lee is downgraded to a tropical depression late Sunday, the hurricane center says .

"(CNN) -- The scene is a familiar one: women and men decked out in traditional dirndls and lederhosen while they swig steins of beer to the toe-tapping tune of oompah bands. Must be Oktoberfest, right? Über wrong. Starkbierzeit, loosely translated as Bavaria's ""strong beer festival"" and literally translated as ""strong beer time,"" is the lesser known but notably stronger of the sud-soaked events for Müncheners. This year, Starkbierzeit began March 9 and runs until March 25. Paulaner am Nockherberg is Munich's most famous watering hole for the two-week Lenten celebration, which has monastic origins. The Bavarian brewery takes its name from the Paulaner monks who produced the original doppelbock called Salvator, Latin for savior. ""Doppelbocks are usually reddish-brown bottom-fermented lagers, and generally show a toffee-like, bready aroma and a rich malty palate with notable residual sweetness,"" according to ""The Oxford Companion to Beer."" ""While Salvator is the most well-known doppelbock, almost 200 other breweries indicate the style by adding '-ator' to the beer's name,"" continues the comprehensive book. The monks brewed the high-gravity beers to provide liquid nourishment while they fasted for the 40 days of Lent. The meal-in-a-bottle, or ""liquid bread,"" contains an alcohol by volume (ABV) of at least 7.5% but often clocks in closer to the 9% range. To put that in perspective, the typical märzen-style beer served at Oktoberfest falls between 5% and 6% ABV. During the festival, participating beer halls keep shorter hours than in Oktoberfest to account for the potency of the beer served in the one-liter ceramic steins. Popular travel guide publisher Lonely Planet urges revelers in its book ""A Year of Festivals"" to ""Come with good beer legs -- doppelbocks are going to really test them.""

"(CNN) -- The two Australian radio personalities who made the prank phone call to a British hospital caring for the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge made tearful apologies Monday for making the call, which may have led to the suicide of a nurse who spoke to the pair. Mel Greig and Michael Christian, both crying at times, told two Australian television shows Monday that their thoughts are with the family of Jacintha Saldanha, the 46-year-old nurse who put the prank call through to the ward where the duchess was. Saldanha apparently committed suicide Friday. ""I'm very sorry and saddened for the family, and I can't imagine what they've been going through,"" Greig said on the program ""Today Tonight."" Christian described himself as ""gutted, shattered and heartbroken."" ""For the part we played, we're incredibly sorry,"" Christian said on ""Today Tonight."" The pair said the idea for the call came out of a production meeting before their 2DayFM show, the idea being to capitalize on what was the hottest topic in the news, Catherine's pregnancy. The prank has drawn public outrage, which has snowballed since the nurse's death. ""This death is on your conscience,"" reads one post on 2DayFM's Facebook page. Several posters accused Greig and Christian of having ""blood on your hands."" But in their interviews Monday, both stressed that while they made the call to King Edward VII Hospital, they did not have a say on whether it went to air. The call was recorded and then went through a vetting process at their network, Southern Cross Austereo, before it was broadcast, they said. ""This was put through every filter that everything is put through before it makes it to air,"" Christian said in an interview with the program ""A Current Affair."" But Christian said he did not know what that vetting process entailed. ""I'm certainly not aware of what filters it needs to pass through,"" he said. ""Our role is just to record and get the audio,"" Christian said. Greig and Christian said they never expected the prank call to be successful. Death casts glare on 'shock jocks' Posing as Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, the pair said they thought their bad accents would give them away and whoever answered the phone at the hospital would hang up on them. ""We wanted to be hung up on with our silly voices,"" Greig said. ""We assumed that we'd be hung up on, and that would be that,"" Christian said. But they were put through to the duchess's ward and given some details of her medical condition. ""It was never meant to go that far. It was meant to be a silly little prank that so many people have done before,"" Greig said. It was Saldanha who put the call through. ""If we played any involvement in her death, then we're very sorry for that,"" said Greig, who described how she found out about Saldana's apparent suicide. ""It's the worst phone call I've had in my life,"" she said, fighting tears. ""There's not a minute that goes by that we don't think about her family and what they must be going through, and the thought that we may have played a part in that is gut-wrenching,"" Greig said. The pair have been taken off the air by their network, which has not said when they might return. ""I don't even want to think about going back on air, to be honest,"" Greig said. ""I'm still trying to make sense of it all,"" Christian said. ""We're shattered. We're people, too."" Greig said she'd willingly face Saldanha's family if it would help bring them closure. ""If that's gonna make them feel better, then I'll do what I have to do,"" she said. ""I've thought about this a million times in my head, that I've wanted to just reach out to them and just give them a big hug and say sorry,"" Greig said. ""I hope they're OK, I really do.""","Michael Christian says he's ""gutted, shattered and heartbroken""

"New York (CNN) -- A lawyer for a man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz in 1979 says his client falsely confessed to authorities in May and will plead not guilty when he is arraigned next month. The attorney's statement Thursday morning came after Pedro Hernandez made a brief appearance in Manhattan criminal court. ""The statements by my client (to police last spring) are not reliable,"" defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said. ""They are what we term false confessions."" A grand jury on Wednesday indicted New Jersey resident Hernandez on charges of second-degree murder first-degree kidnapping. At Thursday's hearing, a judge transferred the case to New York State Supreme Court -- the state's main trial court system -- in Manhattan and set an arraignment for December 12. Missing child case 'awakened America' Police said Hernandez in May confessed to killing Patz, who disappeared on his way to a New York school bus stop more than 33 years ago. Hernandez -- who was a stock clerk in Lower Manhattan in May 1979 -- admitted that he choked the boy after luring him into the basement of a Manhattan grocery store, police said. Hernandez allegedly told authorities that he threw away the boy's body in a garbage bag. The remains have not been found. Etan disappeared on May 25, roughly a month before Hernandez left New York to resume living at his mother's south Jersey home, according to family members and police. Fishbein has claimed Hernandez has been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia, and that he has ""an IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range.""

On Wednesday, district attorney spokeswoman Erin Duggan said the indictment was ""the outcome of a lengthy and deliberative process, involving months of factual investigation and legal analysis."" ""We believe the evidence that Mr. Hernandez killed Etan Patz to be credible and persuasive, and that his statements are not the product of any mental illness,"" she said Wednesday. Besides arguing that the confession was false, Fishbein said he would argue that the prosecution has insufficient evidence, and that the statements Hernandez made to police are inadmissible. Patz's plight catapulted concern for missing children to the national forefront after authorities put his image on thousands of milk cartons, a technique that would become more common in the next few years.

"(CNN) -- A storm over southwestern Mexico weakened further Saturday to a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center said. Carlotta was expected to continue to drench the area for another day or two, but all warnings and watches were discontinued. The tropical depression was located about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north-northeast of the resort town of Acapulco, the center said in its 11 a.m ET advisory. It was moving toward the northwest at about 12 mph (19 kph), and the depression or its remnants would ""meander"" in the area for up to two days, the hurricane center said. At least two children were killed when Carlotta slammed southern Mexico at hurricane strength, unleashing fierce winds and dumping intense rains over Oaxaca state. The storm destroyed a clay house Friday night in Pluma Hidalgo, killing a 13-year-old girl and her 7-year-old sister, said Cynthia Tobar, a spokeswoman for Mexico's civil protection agency. The girls' mother was seriously injured and taken to a hospital in the city of Huatulco, Tobar said. According to preliminary reports, Carlotta ripped off the roofs of homes and caused widespread power outages and small landslides, Tobar said. Authorities will survey the area once daylight comes and and the weather conditions are favorable. In the mountain community of Pluma Hidalgo, about 1,200 people are in shelters, Tobar said. Many more evacuated to stay with relatives or friends, she said. Carlotta is expected to leave total rainfall accumulations of 4 to 8 inches through Monday over parts of southern Mexico, with as much as 15 inches of rain in isolated areas, the hurricane center said.

The storm, packing winds of 50 mph, was located about 220 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, according to the National Hurricane Center's 8 p.m. ET advisory. Forecast models did not have a consensus on Debby's long-term track, and it was nearly stationary Saturday evening. Outer rain bands lashed portions of west-central and south Florida. Nine oil and gas production platforms were evacuated, equivalent to 1.5% of the 596 manned platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, the federal government said Saturday. One of 70 rigs was evacuated. The Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness in Louisiana was in touch with parishes and the National Weather Service, said spokeswoman Veronica Mosgrove. ""Our concern is if it were to ... head west we could get some coastal flooding and high tides,"" she told CNN. If needed, the office could coordinate shelter, transportation and assistance with sand bags. Plaquemines Parish on the southern tip of Louisiana planned to declare a state of emergency Sunday morning, said emergency preparedness director Guy Laigast. The parish expects a slow rise of water pushed by the winds. Crews will place sand bags along a back levee in Myrtle Grove, Laigast said. Louisiana Highway 23, a main road in the parish, could be affected. St. Mary Parish planned Monday to place warning signs at two communities built at sea level, said Duval Arthur, director of emergency preparedness. ""We're anticipating a 3- to 4-foot high tide. Water would be over the road in those areas."" Charles Roeseler, meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Houston-Galveston office, said Debby ""could really go in a number of directions"" -- Florida, Louisiana and Texas. ""It would be a welcome rain"" in Texas, he said. Tropical storm warnings were posted from the mouth of the Pearl River, west to Morgan City, Louisiana, but do not include New Orleans. Such warnings indicate tropical storm conditions are expected within 36 hours in the warning areas. A slow northward movement was expected Sunday morning, followed by a gradual westward turn by late Sunday or early Monday. Some strengthening is expected over the next two days, the center said. The hurricane center predicted a possible storm surge of up to 3 feet along the coast, with estimated rainfall amounts between 3 and 6 inches. Debby's formation marks the first time in history that four named storms have formed before July 1, according to CNN Meteorologist Monica O'Connor.

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Gordon churned across the eastern Azores early Monday after making landfall on the northern Atlantic islands, forecasters said. The center of the storm is expected to pass between Santa Maria Island and San Miguel Island on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The Azores are roughly 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) west of Lisbon, Portugal. ""Swells generated by Gordon will cause dangerous surf and rip current conditions in the central and eastern Azores,"" the weather agency said. As of Monday morning, the hurricane was moving east-northeast at about 20 mph (32 kph) and carried maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph). Gordon was expected to weaken after leaving the Azores. A projection map shows the hurricane weakening to a tropical depression between the Azores and mainland Europe.","The Azores are roughly 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) west of Lisbon, Portugal .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Hurricane Igor maintained its Category 4 status Monday afternoon, still huffing and puffing top sustained winds of 150 mp (240 kph) although tracking maps show the storm remaining in the open Atlantic, far from land. Behind it, Tropical Storm Julia strengthened and could become a hurricane with in the next day or so, the National Hurricane Center said. Julia, too, was moving away from land, although a tropical storm warning was in effect for the southern Cape Verde islands as the storm moved past. Igor, which started as a tropical storm on Saturday, rapidly intensified from a Category 2 to a Category 4 storm Sunday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters described it as ""large and powerful"" but said it would likely drop to a Category 3 storm by the end of the week. As of 5 p.m. ET Monday, Igor's center was about 830 miles (1,335 kilometers) east of the northern Leeward Islands. It was moving west at about 10 mph (17 kph). Hurricane-force winds extended up to 50 miles (85 kilometers) from Igor's center, and tropical storm-force winds can be felt up to 195 miles (315 kilometers) outward, according to the Hurricane Center. As of Sunday evening, no coastal watches or warnings were in effect, and the storm is expected to turn to the west-northwest by Tuesday. While the storm is expected to stay north of the Caribbean islands, the islands could experience some wind and rain because of Igor's size, forecasters said. Meanwhile, in the far eastern Atlantic, Tropical Storm Julia formed Sunday night.  As of 5 p.m. ET Monday, its center was about 210 miles (335 kilometers) west of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, but the storm was pulling away from the islands. The storm's maximum sustained winds were at 50 mph (85 kph). It was moving west-northwest at 14 mph (22 kph). Additional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches are possible over the northwest portion of the Cape Verde Islands, with isolated maximum amounts of 4 inches possible in some locations, forecasters said. These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Tracking maps show Julia becoming a Category 1 hurricane over the open Atlantic later in the week before dropping back to tropical storm intensity without nearing land.","NEW: Igor holds strength, stays away from land .

"(CNN) -- Extreme fire weather across much of the Western United States on Wednesday continued to fuel dozens of wildfires, endangering several communities and threatening to drive more people from their homes. At least 70 large fires were burning across 13 states west of the Mississippi River, according to the National Interagency Coordination Center. California had the most with 13, followed by Nevada with 12 and Idaho with 10, the center said. The Marines joined the fight on Wednesday, with helicopter units from California joining U.S. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units from Colorado, Wyoming, North Carolina and California in fighting the fires by air. The Marine units will help fight fires around San Diego. In California alone, 8,000 firefighters were fighting a dozen fires, the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said Wednesday. The state issued a burn ban, saying only some campfires are allowed. Conditions could worsen in some places over the next few days. The National Weather Service said a weather pattern developing in parts of Oregon could produce conditions favorable to ""explosive fire growth."" In all, parts of 10 states were covered by Red Flag warnings projecting extreme fire weather. In central Washington state, the wind-whipped Taylor Bridge Fire had scorched some 22,000 acres and destroyed at least 60 homes, fire officials said. One of those structures was the home of Elaine Burt, who unsuccessfully tried to get past firefighters to save her dogs and other animals at her home, according to CNN affiliate KING-TV.. ""The fireman said I had to not stay there,"" she told the station. ""He said is there anyone else in your house. I said no, but there's a lot of animals and he said 'I'm sorry, ma'am, but you can't stay here."" ""They're all dead, and my house is gone,"" she said tearfully. Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire declared Kittitas and Yakima counties to be in states of emergency, according to a written statement from her office. The Washington National Guard will provide air support to the Department of Natural Resources, which is in charge of statewide firefighting efforts. Authorities have already evacuated around 900 people near the Taylor Bridge Fire, the governor's office said. No injuries were reported. More than 900 firefighters were battling the fire near Cle Elum, Washington, said Rex Reed, the incident commander. He predicted the fire would be 25% contained by nightfall Wednesday. The weather was ""cooperating"" Wednesday, he said, referring to calmer winds, but firefighters have their work cut out for them the rest of the week. Hot and dry conditions are expected. ""Unless Mother Nature helps us out here, we're going to be fighting this a while,"" Joe Seemiller, a captain with Kittitas County Fire and Rescue, told CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. Elsewhere, more evacuations were under consideration near Featherville, Idaho, where more than 800 firefighters were trying to get a hand on the sprawling Trinity Ridge fire. The fire grew significantly since Tuesday, forcing authorities to call an emergency meeting of residents of Featherville and nearby Pine to discuss possible evacuations. Near the border between Oregon and California, crews were battling an aggressive southern run by the Barry Point Fire, which has torched some 48,000 acres of land in the two states, according to the incident command team's website. With temperatures above 90 degrees, low humidity and wind gusts nearing 20 mph, the lightning-sparked fire has a high potential for further growth, the interagency center said, forcing the evacuation of homes in California, 15 miles south of the state border. Residents evacuate as hundreds of firefighters battle California wildfires . More than 800 firefighters and support personnel were working in Oregon and Nevada to corral the 432,378-acre Holloway Fire, the largest of the Western wildfires. It was ignited by a lightning strike on August 5. For the first time since the fire began August 5, flames began to die down Tuesday night after rising as high as 15 feet earlier in the day, incident commanders reported. They said Wednesday that they hope to have the Nevada portion of the fire out on Wednesday. In Northern California, the Rush Fire had grown by 59,000 acres in just 24 hours, the National Interagency Coordination Center reported. Also, a pair of fires in Lake County, north of San Francisco, burned 7,000 acres and were 30% contained Tuesday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Two buildings were destroyed and one was damaged, CNN affiliate KGO reported. An additional 480 homes are threatened, and a firefighter was injured while battling the flames, said Julie Hutchinson of the state's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. She did not have information on the status of the injured firefighter. Meteorologists predict the dry heat will last into next week, not good news for firefighters. Any thunderstorms that pop up could present more bad news than good, since lightning strikes could spark more flames. As of Wednesday, wildfires have burned through 6.47 million acres this year, surpassing the 6.36 million acres burned by this date last year, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The total acreage burned this year is about 3.4 million acres short of the record set in 2006, when 1,801 fires burned a total of 9.87 million acres, according to center statistics.

"Rome (CNN) -- At least 16 people died, one was missing and 350 were injured after a 5.8-magnitude earthquake shook northern Italy Tuesday, Italian authorities said. The earthquake, which forced thousands of people from their homes, came nine days after a 6.0-magnitude quake struck the same region, killing seven people. Italian civil protection authorities said two of Tuesday's deaths were not directly caused by the quake. Tuesday's quake was followed by dozens of aftershocks. The U.S. Geological Survey recorded one aftershock of 5.6 magnitude. Look at high-res images of the disaster . The quakes have displaced some 14,000 people, the civil protection agency said. Tuesday's earthquake was centered in the province of Modena, near Bologna. The towns of Mirandola and Cavezzo were closest to the epicenter, civil protection authorities said. Witnesses reported on Twitter that Cavezzo was about 70% destroyed. Pictures purportedly from the town, as well as a video stream from Italian newspaper Corriere de la Serra, show damaged and destroyed buildings. ""People are very scared. It's been shaking nonstop for the past week,"" said journalist Andrea Vogt, who was near the epicenter. The earthquakes have been ""a real shock,"" she said, adding that no residents she spoke with could remember so many quakes in such a short period of time. ""Factories were full,"" said Vogt, a freelancer based in Bologna. ""Many of the workers were working on repairs to the already damaged buildings."" A spokeswoman for the government office in Modena said as many as 12,000 people could be displaced, including those affected by the previous earthquake. ""Damages are very serious. The old centers of many villages have been closed down to (the) public and many little villages have been completely evacuated,"" she said. Authorities were setting up tents to house those forced from their homes, she said, and hotels and campsites were offering space to those in need. The Italian railway company was sending eight coaches -- expected to shelter 400 people -- to the village of Crevalcore, near Bologna, the civil protection agency said. At the time of Tuesday's quake, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti was meeting with the head of the civil protection agency and the governor of the region to discuss the previous quake. ""The state will do all what needs to be done, in the quickest way, to assure the return to normal life to such a special and productive region of the country,"" Monti said in a televised statement. The quake response was expected to be among the issues discussed at a Cabinet meeting scheduled for 9 a.m. Wednesday. Some buildings that were damaged in last week's earthquake were further damaged on Tuesday, a spokeswoman said. ""San Felice sul Panaro and Mirandola registered most of the damage,"" she added. Violetta Galia said she was afraid to remain in Bologna. ""We've been having many quakes, so it's not safe to go back to work. We are having problems with communications, so it's not easy to get in contact with somebody by phone,"" she told CNN via Skype. ""I don't feel safe -- I need to go away, I don't want to live (in) Bologna. If I don't leave Bologna, I will never feel safe because we are still having quakes every three or five minutes."" CNN iReporter Martina Lunardelli, a freelance translator and interpreter, said she was at work in Pieve di Soligo, Italy, when she felt the earthquake. She said she heard ""that thunder sound and my head spinning fast, as if I was drunk and could not see the others around since they were out of focus. I felt so strange."" A spokeswoman for the prefecture in Ferrara province said people were in need of urgent help. ""We need tents. The number of displaced is increasing. It will take time to check if homes are safe, and also people are terrified and don't want to sleep in their houses,"" she said. ""We had enormous damage to all our factories, and there will be dramatic consequences on employment."" The area's cultural heritage has also suffered, she said, with two churches destroyed in the village of Cento and another church facade collapsing. Authorities face an additional logistical challenge in helping local communities because emergency supplies were already depleted from the response to the earlier quake. Some railway routes were affected by the earthquake, but Trenitalia, the Italian train system, said late Tuesday afternoon that all had been reopened and that train service was returning to normal. Earlier in the day, some high-speed services from Bologna to Milan and Florence, among others, were running slower than usual. Northern Italy is the heartland of the country's manufacturing industry. ""It's going to have an economic impact as well as a human impact,"" Vogt said of the earthquake. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro, Marilia Brochetto and Phil Han and journalists Barbie Nadeau and Livia Borghese contributed to this report.","At least 16 people are dead, Italy's civil protection agency says .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- The wife of an alleged suicide bomber who killed eight people at a U.S. base in Afghanistan last week says she is shocked by his actions but ""proud"" of what he did. Defne Bayrak, the Turkish wife of Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi -- a Jordanian doctor identified as the attacker -- said she doubted accusations her husband had been an intelligence agent, but was satisfied he did not die in vain. ""I am proud of my husband. My husband accomplished a very big operation in such a war,"" she told reporters. ""If he is a martyr, may God accept his martyrdom."" Al-Balawi has been named as the suspected bomber behind a December 30 attack on a U.S. base in Khost, in southeastern Afghanistan, that killed seven CIA officers and contractors, and a Jordanian army captain. U.S. and Jordanian officials say al-Balawi had been recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence agent, despite concerns over his extremist views, and was being used in the hunt for a senior al Qaeda figure. Bayrak, speaking from their home in Istanbul, told CNN Turk television she was ""shocked"" to hear what he had done. ""It is impossible for me to make a guess if he was an agent, what was his reason going there,"" she said. ""I am not saying whether I am believing or not believing. I am trying to say, we were not expecting something like this."" Al-Balawi's mother, Shnara Fadel al-Balawi, told CNN her son, who she said had been a loner since childhood, had aspired to go to America, even telling her last year that he had booked a ticket to the United States. It is not clear that he did go to the United States, however. His wife said he went to Pakistan for further schooling and then found work. Bayrak, an author and Turkish-Arabic translator, said they had been continually in communication via the Internet and that he repeatedly said he was coming home. ""When he phoned us, his conversations were very normal. Since he was always talking about coming to Turkey, naturally a human being would be shocked when such news comes,"" she said. His brother told CNN that al-Balawi's actions were ""out of character"" and that the man was ""under pressure."" The man's father, who said he was shocked by his son's actions, added that he had been called from Afghanistan, by a man speaking broken Arabic who told him his son was dead and that he had died as a hero in an operation to kill CIA agents. The caller said, according to the father, the circumstances could make problems for his family and that they would have to cope. The family didn't know whether the Afghan caller was from al Qaeda, but thinks it was some militant group. A Jordanian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said authorities in Jordan arrested al-Balawi more than a year ago ""for some suspicious information related to him,"" but released him because of a lack of evidence. ""After (a) few months, he got in touch with us through the Internet and sent us several e-mails that include very important and rather dangerous information that might affect the security and stability of the country,"" the official told CNN. ""We kept in touch with him through e-mails in order to get more information and also trying to bring him over to be able to get more information. We shared and exchanged the information he gave us with some other friendly countries that are involved in countering terrorism."" U.S. sources said bin Zeid was the Jordanian operative working closely with al-Balawi, who was from the same hometown as the onetime leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently thought al-Balawi had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's No. 2 figure, the former intelligence official said. Former CIA official Robert Richer called the bombing the greatest loss of life for the agency since the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight agents. An American intelligence official vowed last week that the United States would avenge the attack. CNN's Nic Robertson, Caroline Faraj and Talia Kayali contributed to this report.","Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi thought to be bomber who killed 7 CIA operatives .

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Carlotta bore down on Mexico's southwestern coast Friday evening, prompting residents and tourists alike to brace in the face of potent winds and heavy rains. A tropical storm early Friday, Carlotta gained strength over the course of the day and was described as ""a rapidly intensifying Category 2 hurricane"" in the National Hurricane Center's 2 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) advisory. The latest update, issued three hours later, reported that Carlotta had maintained its potency -- with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph. By that point, the storm's eye was situated about 10 miles (20 kilometers) south-southwest of Puerto Angel, Mexico, and 225 miles (365 kilometers) east-southeast of Acapulco. ""Hurricane-force winds are probably already occurring within the hurricane warning area, and these conditions will likely continue and spread westward (Friday night),"" the center said in its 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET) advisory. The hurricane warning is in effect for parts of the Pacific coast of Mexico, from the seaport city of Salina Cruz to the resort town of Acapulco. A warning means hurricane conditions are expected as soon as Friday night, according to the center. A hurricane watch -- which means hurricane conditions are possible -- has been issued for coastal areas east of Salina Cruz to Barra de Tonala and west of Acapulco to Tecpan de Galeana. Carlotta's top winds had measured 40 mph on Thursday and were only 70 mph early Friday, before it quickly picked up power. But now that part of the storm is already over land, Carlotta is not expected to get any stronger and should weaken over Saturday, the hurricane center predicted. The storm was moving toward the northwest at 12 mph and should continue at that speed through the night, the hurricane center said. The forecast calls for Carlotta to slow somewhat and turn more toward the west-northwest on Saturday. Hurricane-force winds, which are 74 mph or stronger, on Friday evening extended out about 30 miles from the center of Carlotta. In addition to fierce winds, ""a dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant coastal flooding"" north and east of the storm's center. Near the coast, the surge will likely cause destructive waves, according to the hurricane center. Rainfall could cause ""life-threatening"" flash floods and mudslides, the center said, with some spots along the Oaxaca coast likely to get 12 to 15 inches of rain. Are you there?

"(CNN) -- Despite weakening, Tropical Storm Ernesto poured heavy rains Wednesday on Mexico and portions of Central America, the National Hurricane Center said. Ernesto, once a Category 1 hurricane, was moving into the Bay of Campeche where it is expected to become a hurricane again. As of 8 p.m. ET, the storm was about 20 miles (35 kilometers) east-northeast of Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico, the center reported. Ernesto was moving west at 7 mph with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. Officials in Ciudad del Carmen reported one gust of 58 mph. The storm is expected to make landfall a second time on Mexico's coast on Thursday. Mexico issued a hurricane watch along the coast from Barra de Nautla to Coatzacoalcos, an area that includes the coastal city of Veracruz. Between 4 to 8 inches of rain are expected in some areas of the region, with as much as 12 inches in parts of the Mexican states of Tabasco and Veracruz. Belize, the southern Yucatan Peninsula and northern Guatemala may see as much as 4 inches of rain, the hurricane center said. Complete coverage of weather .

"(CNN) -- The undersea earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Wednesday was the largest earthquake of its type ever recorded and has increased the risk of more powerful quakes in the region, a leading expert has said. Director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore, Kerry Sieh, told CNN that the 8.6 Richter scale undersea earthquake was the largest ""strike-slip"" quake - steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other - ever recorded. ""Before that we thought that 8.1 was as big as they get, but this 8.6 quake was phenomenal,"" Sieh said. ""It has been absolutely jaw-dropping and has caused a lot of foment among seismologists."" He said the quake had provided two new insights for seismologists. Firstly, that strike-slip earthquakes, which are normally not as powerful as mega-thrust quakes where one plate runs underneath another, could be this powerful. Secondly, that big earthquakes of this type could run as deep as the Earth's mantle, the viscous layer beneath the Earth's crust. ""We are learning details about the nature of the ruptures,"" he said. ""What are the fits and starts of the fault? How does the fault break?"" Likening the tectonic plates to a group of 10 men holding onto an elephant with a rope, he said that pressure on the plates becomes greater as the struggle becomes unequal. ""Finally, when one of the guys slips and can't hold the rope what happens is that the nine other guys are holding his 10%, so they have to add 10% more effort to hold on,"" he said, adding that when a further man falls the remaining eight have an extra 20% of the force to contend with. ""Eventually what you have is a cascade of failures and the last guy has to let go and the tectonics win and the fault moves,"" Sieh said. ""What we had in Sumatra between 2004 and 2007 was pop! Pop! Pop! Three great earthquakes; 9.2, 8.7, 8.4."" He said that Wednesday's earthquake was likely to have increased the stress on the plate boundaries near Aceh, increasing the risks of another major earthquake in the same area as the 2004 disaster. ""There's still one or two patches left to go,"" Sieh said. He said the past 10 years had been particularly seismically active, providing invaluable information to seismologists. ""We've really seen a revolution in our understanding of earthquakes in the last 10 years because of these earthquakes,"" he said, adding that new technology and the speed with which information was shared had changed the landscape in understanding earthquakes.","Sumatra quake the largest of its type ever recorded .

"London (CNN) -- Young stars shone at the Olympic pool Monday as Yannick Agnel of France won his second gold medal of the London Games, American teen sensation Missy Franklin won her first and a 15-year-old Lithuanian stunned the women's 100-meter breaststroke field. The 20-year-old Agnel, just a day after swimming an amazing anchor leg in leading France to victory in the men's 4x100 meter free style relay, routed the field in the 200-meter freestyle. He beat both silver medalists, Park Taehwan of South Korea and Yang Sun of China, by 1.79 seconds. Ryan Lochte of the United States finished fourth. Franklin, just 17, swam an American record 58.33 in the 100-meter backstroke, ahead of Australia's Emily Seebohm and Japan's Aya Terakawa. Seebohm led at the halfway point but with the two side-by-side, the young American overpowered her down the stretch. Only 20 minutes earlier Franklin had swum in the 200-meter freestyle semifinals, qualifying for Tuesday's final. Lithuanian Ruta Meilutyte won her country's first swimming medal ever as an independent nation, winning gold in the final medal event of the night, the women's 100-meter breaststroke. ""It's too much for me,"" the clearly overwhelmed 15-year-old said. ""I can't believe it."" Matt Grevers of the United States won the men's 100-meter backstroke. The hearts of the host nation were broken when teen diving star Tom Daley failed to bring home a medal in the 10-meter synchronized platform event. The 18-year-old and his appropriately-named partner Pete Waterfield finished fourth, with favorites Yuan Cao and Yanquan Zhang of China taking gold. The disappointment was tempered somewhat by the men's gymnastics team, which took bronze, its first medal in the sport in 100 years. When the results were first announced Great Britain was to get silver, but the fourth-place Japanese team protested a score for one of its gymnasts. The judges upped Kohei Uchimura's mark on the pommel horse, giving Japan 271.952 to Great Britain's 271.711 and Ukraine's 271.526. As many expected, China won the team title, as it did in two of the past three Olympics. The United States drew level with China for the total number of medals so far, with 17 apiece, but nine of China's are gold, compared with five for Team USA. In equestrian, Queen Elizabeth's granddaughter Zara Phillips had a good day in Greenwich, where she and Great Britain are in medal contention. As 50,000 people, including Prince William and Prince Harry, watched, Phillips cleared all 28 jumps during the cross-country portion of the team eventing contest. Germany leads the competition, which concludes Tuesday, with Great Britain second and Sweden third. Meanwhile, a controversy was averted as the International Olympic Committee and the International Judo Federation approved allowing Saudi judo competitor Wojdan Shaherkani to wear her headscarf, Saudi National Olympic Committee spokesman Razan Baker told CNN's Nic Robertson.

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Emilia raged into to a Category 4 storm Tuesday, hurling 140 mph winds as it spun across the Pacific Ocean. As of Tuesday morning, Emilia was about 680 miles (1,095 kilometers) south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California, Mexico, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said. It was traveling west-northwest at about 12 mph. No coastal watches or warnings have been issued due to Emilia, and the hurricane center did not indicate if it is expected to hit or even approach land. Though Emilia's intensity could fluctuate Tuesday, ""gradual weakening is expected to begin by tonight and continue through Thursday,"" the weather agency said Tuesday. Past 12 months warmest recorded in United States . Farther west, the cyclone known as Daniel fizzled from a hurricane to a tropical storm. By 5 a.m. ET Tuesday, Daniel's maximum sustained winds had weakened to 70 mph -- under the 74-mph threshold to qualify as a hurricane, according to the hurricane center.

"(CNN) -- Food and water were being dropped by helicopters on Monday to residents in rural Indonesia cut off after a 6.6 magnitude earthquake struck, triggering landslides, according to the National Disaster Management Agency. At least 6 people were killed and 43 wounded when the earthquake struck Sunday near the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of the National Disaster Agency said. About 471 homes and buildings have been destroyed, Nugroho said. Many of those displaced are staying in shelters or government buildings that were undamaged by the quake. Rescuers have been unable to reach several village because landslides triggered by the quake are blocking the roads. Heavy equipment and bulldozers are helping clear the way. Disaster, health and social welfare officials, including the Red Cross, are headed to the area to provide emergency assistance, trucks and ambulances. Indonesia is on the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","An earthquake that struck Indonesia triggers landslides, an official says .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Joining ""likes"" on Facebook, the social network has added dozens of new types of posts, including ""bought,"" ""read"" and ""want."" Sixty applications that let users publish information automatically to Facebook launched at a news conference held at a trendy nightclub here on Wednesday. Many of these are new versions of existing online services or mobile apps. Apps for foodies, like Foodspotting and Foodily, can publish to a user's Facebook profile when she updates her digital diary of meals. Ticketmaster can publish to Facebook when customers buy concert tickets. Like with Facebook Music, the social network may create monthly personalized reports that are posted to a person's profile showing how the app was used at any given time. For example, someone could see the places a friend traveled to last summer, thanks to TripAdvisor. Since the launch of Facebook Music in September, participants such as MOG and Spotify have reported large increases in membership. Some 400,000 people coming from Facebook have signed up for MOG accounts since September, and each day, Facebook sends an average of 4,000 people who have never visited MOG before, David Hyman, the music company's CEO, said in a phone interview. ""The platform itself is the biggest traffic generator we've ever had,"" Hyman said. ""It is very significant."" Facebook programmers have created a mathematical algorithm that will examine the types of posts a person has chosen to give prominent placement to on his or her profile, Facebook CTO Bret Taylor said in an interview. Whether food, movies or exercises logged into Facebook, the site will try to predict what you're most passionate about based on past choices, similar to how the system determines its news feed based partly on the people you contact most often, Taylor said. Each user will be able to manually override these profile placements, he said. ""People care a lot about the way their profile looks,"" Taylor said. These features are only available to those who have enabled the Facebook Timeline, which opened to everyone about a month ago. Eventually, every user will be required to use that version of the site profile. Taylor described the new app features as part of a maturation of Facebook, which goes beyond the initial perspective of its co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who coded the website in his sophomore year at Harvard University. Zuckerberg, who is now Facebook's CEO, did not attend the event Wednesday. ""Previously, the profile was all the things Mark Zuckerberg was interested in in college,"" Taylor said. ""You know, movies, music and books."" (Zuckerberg, 27, only lists one book on his Facebook profile: Ender's Game, which came out the year after he was born.) Facebook will review each new action, as it's called, that's proposed by developers in order to screen for profanity or other unwanted words, Mike Vernal, the company's platform engineering director, said in an interview. Software developers will be able to create an unlimited number of these actions, he said. That would be useful for something like iTunes, which allows users to ""listen,"" ""watch"" and ""buy"" things, although Apple is not participating in the program. A spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. Despite some early opposition, Facebook wants to encourage all developers to adopt the new tools. ""We've got a whole new set, a whole new class, of applications that we think we're enabling with this platform,"" Carl Sjogreen, a Facebook product director, said onstage during the announcement. ""When we say anything, we really mean anything."" In characteristic Facebook ambition, Sjogreen added, ""We're even more excited about the thousands of apps to come.""","Facebook is now letting all developers make apps that can automatically publish to profiles .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Halle Berry's lawyers returned to court Tuesday to ask a Los Angeles judge to keep her child's father away from their daughter because of a Thanksgiving Day fight with Berry's fiance. The father, model Gabriel Aubry, claimed in a court filing Monday that the fiance, Olivier Martinez, ambushed him when he was dropping the daughter, 4-year-old Nahla, at Berry's Hollywood Hills home. Police arrested Aubry, 37, and charged him with misdemeanor battery, but he insisted he was not the aggressor in the fistfight, which sent him to a hospital. Berry, 46, and Aubry have been engaged in a bitter legal fight over custody of Nahla since their five-year romance ended in 2010. The battle heated up last year after the Oscar-winning actress announced her engagement to Martinez and asked a family court to allow her to move with the daughter to Paris. Aubry, in a sworn statement that helped him gain a temporary restraining order against Martinez on Monday, said the fight in Berry's driveway last Thursday morning was apparently motivated by the custody battle, which Berry recently lost. Berry, who pays Aubry child support under the shared custody agreement, was told she cannot move to Paris with the child unless Aubry goes there as well. In his statement, Aubry said: ""While he was attacking me physically, Mr. Martinez said to me in an aggressive and threatening voice, 'You cost us $3 million. When you see the judge, you're going to tell him you're going to Paris or I'm going to kill you. You're going to Paris, you're going to get your 20 grand a month in child support. From now on you're going to do drop-offs on the street.'"" Berry: I'm so glad I waited to have Nahla . Aubry's lawyer attached several photos to the filing to show his blackened, swollen eyes, cut lip and bruised face. Aubry was treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for a fractured rib and several bruises on his face and forehead, and he required stitches to repair three cuts in his mouth, the filing said. In the statement, Aubry said Martinez first threatened him the day before, when Berry and the two men were visiting Nahla's school. ""Martinez, who seemed very angry and agitated, suddenly started speaking to me in French, and spouted off things such as, 'I wish I could beat the s**t out of you right now. You're lucky we're in a school right now,"" his statement said. The next morning, when Aubry was parked in Berry's gated driveway to hand over his daughter to the nanny to spend Thanksgiving Day with her mother, Martinez approached him and said, ""We need to talk,"" Aubry said. ""All of a sudden, Mr. Martinez jumped on me on the side of my body, and punched me such that he had taken me down to the ground,"" Aubry said in the sworn statement. ""He continued to punch me at least two or three times, kicked me in the ribs with his knee or foot, and took my head in his hands and slammed it to the concrete driveway. It all happened so suddenly, I did not see Mr. Martinez's actions coming, and thus, I was not ready for it and was not able to defend myself."" Aubry suggested that police should look at video from the three security cameras in Berry's driveway ""before she and Mr. Martinez deleted them."" It was unclear if such video exists or if police have it. If so, it could be key evidence on December 13 when Aubry is in court to face the battery charge and on December 17 when he seeks to make permanent the temporary restraining order issued Monday banning Martinez from harassing, intimidating or contacting him. Tuesday's hearing, in which Berry hopes to persuade a judge to order Aubry to stay away from their daughter, will be in a closed courtroom.","A judge orders Berry's fiance to keep away from her ex, Gabriel Aubry .

"(CNN) -- A Cambodian court Wednesday sentenced a 68-year-old Michigan man to 10 years in prison for having sex with children. Phillip Bruce Shepard was arrested in the capital, Phnom Penh, in July. The anti-pedophile group Action Pour les Enfants said the case involved Shepard buying sex from 17 girls and abusing two brothers aged 12 and 14. ""He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for purchasing child prostitution,"" said Phnom Penh Municipal Court prosecutor Ek Chheng Huot. Officials said Shepard was a doctor, working at a private clinic in the capital, before his arrest. Cambodia is categorized by the U.S. government as a destination country for foreign child sex tourists, with increasing reports of Asian men traveling to Cambodia in order to have sex with underage virgin girls, according to a comprehensive 2009 Trafficking in Persons Report. The U.S. State Department report states a significant proportion of trafficking victims in Cambodia are ethnic Vietnamese women and girls who are forced into prostitution in brothels and karaoke bars.","The case involves the abuse of two brothers aged 12 and 14 .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu will hold a late-morning hearing Thursday about the lessons learned and the progress made in the five years since Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and large sections of the Gulf coast. The hearing in Chalmette, Louisiana, will highlight the continuing challenges facing the state. On Wednesday, Landrieu announced that Washington will award $1.8 billion to schools in New Orleans. A provision in an appropriations bill authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide a lump-sum payment for K-12 schools damaged by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. ""The provision also reduced penalties for insufficient flood insurance and alternate projects, which yielded more than $500 million in savings for Louisiana schools,"" Landrieu's office said in a statement. ""This $1.8 billion lump sum settlement is one of the great victories in our fight for a smarter recovery,"" Landrieu said. ""It was a battle worth waging and while we would have liked to have received the money sooner, it was worth the wait. This lump sum approach is a much wiser investment of taxpayer dollars and should serve as a model for the right way to rebuild communities following a major disaster."" New Orleans schools are still rebounding five years after Katrina struck. The money gives ""local leaders the ability to rebuild New Orleans' school system in a comprehensive and strategic manner, instead of using a uncoordinated and piecemeal approach,"" Landrieu's statement said.","The hearing will highlight the continuing challenges facing Louisiana .

"(CNN) -- When Tad Agoglia started to clean up the mess caused by Hurricane Katrina, he couldn't help thinking he was weeks behind schedule. It was two months after the storm, and his crane operating company had just been hired to help in Louisiana. ""I wondered what it would have been like if I had been there on day one,"" Agoglia said. Frustrated by the kind of bureaucratic red tape that delayed aid after Katrina, Agoglia started the First Response Team of America, a mobile, ""24-hour-a-day firehouse"" that provides free emergency aid within hours of a catastrophe. Since 2007, the nonprofit group has responded to many of the country's worst natural disasters, including floods in Rhode Island and Tennessee and tornadoes in Alabama and Mississippi. Today, Agoglia finds himself back in Louisiana. But this time he's dealing with a manmade catastrophe: the Gulf Coast oil spill. ""This is a different kind of disaster,"" said Agoglia, one of three CNN Heroes featured in a recent TV special, ""CNN Heroes: Coming Back from Katrina."" ""When a hurricane comes in, it can be cleaned up. Oil is not that easily cleaned up. Oil could stay around for decades."" The First Response Team has spent the past two months setting up dams and using specialized equipment to vacuum oil from Louisiana's barrier islands. ""I remember clearly the first day the oil reached the beaches of Grand Isle, where we were serving,"" Agoglia said. ""And it was a very emotional response ... to seeing these beautiful beaches and these beautiful animals covered in oil. And the only thing I can explain is that I felt very patriotic. I felt like, this is our land, this is our soil, this is our beaches, our wildlife, and it was being destroyed and contaminated. It was sad to see in person."" Agoglia said the spill has also delivered a devastating blow to a community still reeling from Katrina. ""You're dealing with people that have already lost everything -- everything,"" Agoglia said. ""They had nothing left but each other basically to begin with. And now, only a short few years later, their livelihoods are being threatened."" Phasing out the FEMA trailers . Many families in Louisiana are still living in trailers that were provided after Katrina by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Liz McCartney is trying to change that. McCartney and her boyfriend, Zack Rosenburg, started the nonprofit St. Bernard Project in 2006. ""Our goal is to get those last 1,000 families out of FEMA trailers and back into their homes,"" said McCartney, who was voted CNN Hero of the Year in 2008. The St. Bernard Project, based in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, rebuilds damaged houses with the help of volunteers and skilled supervisors. McCartney says it costs, on average, about $12,000 to turn a gutted home into a livable one. ""To date, we've done just about 300 houses,"" she said. ""We've got more than 50 under construction."" The St. Bernard Project has also opened up a mental health clinic in its office for those struggling to cope with the Katrina and oil spill aftermath. ""We decided we couldn't sit by and not do anything [about the spill],"" McCartney said. ""So we've launched our oil spill response that is focusing primarily on providing mental health services to people in the fishing communities."" Focusing on children . Another CNN Hero, Derrick Tabb, is helping to shape Louisiana's future with his after-school music program, The Roots of Music. Headquartered in New Orleans' French Quarter, the Roots of Music provides free instruments and tutoring to more than 100 students between the ages of 9 and 14. The idea is to connect children to the city's rich musical tradition while keeping them off its dangerous streets. ""We have got a lot done in New Orleans, but we have a lot more to do, especially when it comes down to the kids,"" Tabb said. ""I think we have to focus on them a little a bit more, what's going on in their lives and what's catching their attention and what's keeping their attention."" The Roots of Music caught the attention of actor Tim Robbins, who donated money to its cause and helped organize a benefit concert in May. ""This organization has a goal of taking someone in middle school and putting them on the road to a college education, self-confidence and leadership,"" Robbins said. The program is so popular that Tabb has had to freeze applications for the time being. But he said he has been approached about possibly turning the Roots of Music into a charter school. ""If I take 500, 600 kids in the program, I might as well take them in a school,"" he said. ""They can be with me more than just part of the day. You have more interaction with those kids, and you can start to [know] the kids more and really start to help them out in the areas they need help in."" While he acknowledges that much work still needs to be done in New Orleans, Tabb says he is hopeful about the future. And he is proud at how his city has bounced back from Katrina. ""New Orleans has been a model city as far as recovery,"" he said. ""It's really shown everybody how to pull together and make things work with little resources.""","A trio of CNN Heroes is still working to restore the Gulf after Hurricane Katrina .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- New Orleans is richer than it was before Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, but largely because many of its poor have not returned since the storm, according to a report released Wednesday. Average wages are up, ""knowledge-based"" jobs are gaining ground on the area's traditional blue-collar economy and basic services like schools and hospitals are improving, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu told reporters. ""But there are also some sobering and thoughtful statistics about how far we have to go,"" he said. While the poverty rate of 23 percent is the lowest since 1979, that's nearly double the national average of 13 percent, according to figures from the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center and the Brookings Institution. And many of the city's poor residents have either moved to the suburbs or haven't returned to the area, the report's authors said. ""It's the dispersion of the impoverished population in general and the struggles that folks have had to return is probably the main factor,"" said Allison Plyer, of the Community Data Center. And while the number of poor people in the city has fallen by about half, to about 68,000, the number of poor people living in the six suburban parishes is up, to about 93,000, Plyer said. Since the storm, the metro area's population has rebounded to about 90 percent of the 1.3 million who lived there before the hurricane, according to Wednesday's report. The central city's population of about 355,000 is about is 78 percent of the pre-storm figure, and it's more middle-class and slightly less African-American and Hispanic than before, according to the report. The city's non-white population remains a solid majority, but dropped from 72 percent in 2000 census figures to 69 percent currently, the report states. The non-white population grew slightly in the suburbs, from an estimated 43 percent in 2000 to 45 percent currently, according to the report. Katrina killed more than 1,800 people on the Gulf Coast when it struck near the Louisiana-Mississippi state line on August 29, 2005. Most of the dead were in and around New Orleans, where more than three-quarters of the city flooded after its protective levees failed. Nearly 300,000 people were displaced, and the disaster turned a harsh light on a city that had seen its traditional economy -- based on oil, shipbuilding and tourism -- shrivel since the 1980s. As a result, more of the area's economy is based on white-collar fields like higher education, legal services and education, the report found. Landrieu said those fields and innovative new industries are where the region's future lies. ""Relying on raw materials is important,"" he said. ""But what you do with them and how you transform them by adding value to them is where our future economic success is going to be, as opposed to just extracting raw material. There is a better way, there is a higher way, and it's all for the most part based on knowledge."" Housing costs, which went up sharply when the storm destroyed so much of the city, are still high. Nearly 60 percent of city households and 45 percent of those in the suburbs pay more than 35 percent of their income for shelter, Plyer said. But in part because of the reconstruction effort, New Orleans was sheltered from the worst of the recession that began in late 2007, the report states. And researchers found the people who live there are more engaged in civic life than before, and have demanded reforms of institutions once considered hopelessly broken or corrupt. ""In general, higher numbers of New Orleanians are participating in public meetings and processes and are now more likely than residents of other cities to attend public meetings where city affairs are discussed,"" the report states. Residents ""have demanded and pursued systemic changes in key community and government institutions that were failing to deliver optimal results for citizens and taxpayers,"" such as health care, schools and the courts, it concluded.","Report examines New Orleans five years after Katrina .

"(CNN) -- The woman's Halloween costume featured a Third Reich motif. This was last weekend in a sprawling bar-and-restaurant complex near U.S. 41 on the west coast of Florida. I had made the miscalculation of stopping by in pursuit of a quiet cheeseburger, not realizing that adults in trick-or-treat costumes were making the rounds on this sultry evening. The woman (or the costume shop from where she had purchased her uniform) at least had the good sense to omit the actual swastikas, but that was the only bit of subtlety. The Heinrich Himmler high-fronted military cap, the boots, the swagger stick she kept slapping against her palm. . .some of the customers, playing along, did little comic goose steps as they passed her. I looked up from my newspaper and tried to surmise if anyone was going to be offended enough by this odious display to leave. She beat them to it; she and her friends made a few quick passes through the aisles of the place, then returned to the night, ready to continue their revelry elsewhere. Halloween in the United States is an increasingly odd holiday, no longer child's play, but on this evening I was thinking about another holiday, this one official, that is coming up this week: Veterans Day. And, having unexpectedly encountered the woman in her getup, I found myself wondering what, six and seven decades ago, they would have made of it: what the 16 million Americans who served in the armed forces during World War II, who were sent across the ocean to defeat a brutal enemy, would have thought about this scene. They're old men now, the soldiers who remain; many are frail and in ill health. It can be easy for us to forget that, when they were uprooted from their daily lives in the 1940s, no one knew what the history books would eventually say. No one knew the outcome. They were little more than kids, many of them; they were in effect told by our country: . Are you in school? You'll have to leave it. Have a new wife? You'll have to say goodbye to her. Working at a job you like? Tell your boss that you have to quit. We need you to go halfway across the world, because we need you to save the world. And they did it. Some 292,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines were killed in battle during World War II; another 114,000 died from noncombat causes. Some 671,000 U.S. troops were injured, many of them grievously. The uniforms they put on were not Halloween getups; neither were the uniforms of the enemies they confronted across the oceans. On their way to fight the war, it's a pretty fair guess that they were scared and lonely. They understood that there was no guarantee they would ever be coming home. Each November we are asked to pause and honor them, which is, or should be, an honor in itself. After the events of the last week at Fort Hood in Texas, with their reminder of the sacrifices that the men and women of the military make for us, Veterans Day will hold special meaning this year. This November also marks the second anniversary of the death, at age 92, of my friend Paul Tibbets, who I got to know extraordinarily well during the last years of his life. I'd like to say a few words about him here. At the age of 29, out of all the men and women in the U.S. military, he was selected for a task of almost unfathomable importance. He was told to recruit, organize, supervise and command a group of soldiers and airmen who were to train in absolute secrecy. If he succeeded, he was told, then the war could be won. Someone had started a terrible fight; he was asked to finish it. He did. He got his unit ready. And on an August day in 1945, he flew a B-29 he had named for his mother, Enola Gay, to Japan, where he and his crew dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. It was the single most violent act in the history of mankind, and he carried it out without flinching because he believed, in the deepest part of his heart, one thing above all others: . He could end the long war. He could stop the killing. All of the American soldiers who were on their way to the shores of Japan for a land invasion could turn around and go home, could raise families, could live again in a world at peace. He understood the controversy, and the anger, with which his mission would be received by some. He understood that there were people who would forever hate him. He and I talked about it many times before he died. After the war, he told me, President Harry Truman asked him if people were saying unpleasant things to him because of the bomb. Paul Tibbets told the president that, yes, some people indeed were. And Truman said: . ""You tell them that if they have anything to say, they should call me. I'm the one who sent you."" So it's November again. Veterans Day is upon us. There is a quotation variously attributed to Winston Churchill or George Orwell. Regardless of our individual politics, regardless of our beliefs about the rightness or wrongness of a particular war, the words are worth reflecting upon anew this week: . ""We sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm."" And so, to all who have served us, then, now, and in the future, a word of somber thanks, from those of us here at home. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Sometimes people make light of World War II; that's a mistake .
He says there was nothing funny about the battle a generation faced .
Lives were disrupted, hundreds of thousands died or were injured, he says .

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Debby shriveled to a tropical depression after hitting Florida on Tuesday, but it still packed heavy rains that threatened to worsen flooding along the Gulf Coast and inland towns, forecasters reported. Debby lumbered onto the marshy west coast near Steinhatchee, about 160 miles north of Tampa, on Tuesday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center announced. But it was projected to dump another 4 to 8 inches of precipitation across the area through Wednesday evening, on top of the 2 feet reported in some towns south of Tallahassee by Tuesday. In addition, storm and tidal surges caused flooding as far south as the Tampa Bay area, and it's blamed for one death from a tornado spawned Sunday afternoon in the town of Venus, far inland. As of 8 p.m. ET, Debby had top winds of 35 mph. It was centered about 50 miles west of Gainesville, moving east-northeast at 6 mph and wasn't expected to lose much strength as it crossed the Florida peninsula, forecasters said. Tropical storm warnings up and down the coast were dropped as the depression moved inland, but the storm left high water behind in several towns as it passed. In Sopchoppy, westward across Apalachee Bay from the landfall site, Crystal Pesek said she got a text message from her sister Tuesday morning, asking how the work on her kitchen cabinets was going. ""I told her it's on hold,"" said Pesek. That's because the home she and her husband have spent hours painstakingly renovating was underwater. ""It's on pilings,"" Larry Pesek said. ""The water's never been that high before, that goes without saying. It's just heartbreaking because we've put so much time and effort into the house."" In Sopchoppy, authorities rescued 57 people from homes surrounded by rising water, said Keith Blackmar of the Wakulla County Sheriff's Office. ""It's astonishing. I've never seen anything like this,"" Blackmar said Tuesday. ""Our soil is sandy, so it handles water well, but not this much rain."" ""The water levels came up so fast some of the folks didn't have time to actually pack their things and move out, so they're having to do it after the fact,"" Wakulla County Undersheriff Maurice Langston told CNN. Florida State University researcher Jeff Chanton said the area's low-lying terrain contributes to the misery. ""The coastal gradient -- the rise of the land -- is very, very low here,"" Chanton said. ""If you were to go swimming here and walk out from shore, you could walk out half a mile."" That means a relatively small storm surge can push water ""tens or hundreds of feet onshore,"" he said. ""When you get a lot of rain, it tends to spread out,"" said Chanton, a geochemist. ""So the rivers have large floodplains, and the water gets very wide when it gets wet like this."" Storm surges along Apalachee Bay were expected to run 2 to 4 feet, with 1- to 3-foot tidal flooding expected to the south, including Tampa Bay, the hurricane center said. More than 26 inches of rain had been recorded in Sanborn, south of Tallahassee, by Tuesday morning. Nearby St. Marks saw nearly 22 inches. Other areas on the north side of Apalachee Bay clocked in with between 15 and 20 inches. Flooding and at least one sinkhole cut off parts of Interstate 10, one of the state's major thoroughfares, state transportation officials reported. The Suwannee River surged more than 25 feet in a day, rising from 55 feet deep at White Springs, west of Jacksonville, on Monday to nearly 81 feet on Tuesday afternoon. That's about 4 feet over flood stage. ""We have significant flooding problems,"" said Harvey Campbell, a spokesman for Columbia County's emergency operations center. ""I have people who don't remember in their lifetime the kind of rain we had overnight."" In Pasco County, north of Tampa, authorities issued a mandatory evacuation order Tuesday for 2,000 homes along the Cotee River. Officials were traveling by boat and car to get the word out, and water was standing in some homes as of Tuesday, county spokesman Eric Keaton. Another area river, the Anclote, was above flood stage on Tuesday, and water is not expected to recede for two days. A total of 106 homes in the county are reported damaged, Keaton said. President Barack Obama called Florida Gov. Rick Scott Tuesday ""to ensure the state had no unmet needs as the governor and his team continue to respond to extreme weather and flooding,"" the White House said. Flooding was seen as far south as Fort Myers, where the Caloosahatchee River overflowed its banks into the downtown area. CNN iReporter Alex Butler, who is also a reporter at CNN affiliate WFTX, said normally there is a wall separating the land from the river, but the wall was underwater Tuesday. Obama ""expressed his condolences for the loss of life as well as the extensive damage to homes in Florida as a result of the storm, and reiterated that his administration -- through (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) -- would remain in close contact with the state as they continued to respond to this event and stood ready to provide additional assistance if necessary,"" the White House said. At the state's request, a FEMA liaison officer was on site at the Florida state emergency operations center, according to the White House. Scott declared a state of emergency Monday ""so we can coordinate the use of all state resources to make sure we can respond promptly if anything happens."" Near Tampa, wildlife officials assessed weather conditions so they could assist a manatee calf whose mother was found dead. Residents tied the mother to a sea wall so the calf wouldn't leave its side. An adult male manatee was also staying with the mother and calf. The calf's mother was moved, and officials discovered the calf was older than initially thought, so it was allowed to swim away into Tampa Bay, said Andy Garrette of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. CNN's George Howell, Sean Morris, Matt Smith, Ashley Hayes, Sarah Dillingham, Kim Segal, John Zarrella, Rich Phillips and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: Debby, now a tropical depression, moves inland across Florida .

"(CNN)  -- Calling the ruling ""huge,"" New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin on Thursday reacted to a federal judge finding the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' failure to maintain a shipping channel led to catastrophic flooding during Hurricane Katrina. Nagin said he hopes the court decision will ""open up the floodgates"" for others to file lawsuits against the federal government, including his Louisiana city. However, he acknowledged it's likely the federal government will appeal Wednesday's ruling. Department of Justice spokesman Charles Miller said in an e-mail the government is reviewing the decision and has made ""no determination as to what future steps it would take in this matter."" U.S. District Judge Stanwood Duval Jr. ruled that the ""negligence of the Corps"" by failing to maintain the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet waterway ""was not policy, but insouciance, myopia and short-sightedness."" ""For over 40 years, the Corps was aware that the Reach II levee protecting Chalmette and the Lower Ninth Ward was going to be compromised by the continued deterioration of the [waterway]. ... The Corps had an opportunity to take a myriad of actions to alleviate this deterioration or rehabilitate this deterioration and failed to do so. Clearly, the expression 'talk is cheap' applies here."" Duval issued the ruling in a lawsuit brought by six plaintiffs affected by the 2005 hurricane, who alleged the Corps of Engineers was liable for damages. The judge ruled against one couple, who lived in New Orleans East, but awarded the others, from the Lower Ninth Ward and St. Bernard Parish, damages ranging from $100,000 to $317,000. Nagin said he had thought the ruling was a long shot. ""This was a surprise but a pleasant one,"" he said. The decision applies not only to the six plaintiffs, attorney Pierce O'Donnell said, but also to some 100,000 homes and businesses in St. Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth Ward. Under the precedent set by Duval's ruling, they too will be entitled to compensation, O'Donnell said. At a news conference Thursday, Craig Taffaro, president of St. Bernard Parish, said, ""It's a bittersweet victory in the sense that yes, we are at the table, yes, we are grateful for the judge's ruling and for the legal team to deliver us to this point, but what a shame that we had to go through such devastation and destruction to get here."" At one point a Category 5 hurricane, Katrina had weakened to a Category 3 storm with top sustained winds of 127 mph when it made landfall on the morning of August 29, 2005, between Grand Isle, Louisiana, and the mouth of Mississippi River. Its winds were only slightly diminished when it passed over more populated coastal areas hours later. More than 1,800 people died in the storm, including nearly 1,600 in Louisiana. In New Orleans, the city's levee system failed and widespread flooding occurred. Overall, the storm damage covered more than 90,000 square miles and displaced nearly 300,000 people, causing more than $81 billion in damage. Ivor van Heerden, a researcher who warned of the potential for catastrophic damage from a hurricane, said the ruling is ""total vindication for everybody who was involved."" ""I think he's called a spade a spade,"" van Heerden told CNN by phone. The former deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center said the university fired him because of the investigation he led into the levee failures. The probe put much of the blame for the disaster on the Corps of Engineers. He alleged Thursday that the university blocked him from being an expert witness in the case, but said he ""put together a lot of the science"" and reviewed the defense's explanation to find the holes. ""Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans was a manmade catastrophe with a hurricane trigger,"" he said. ""I saw the suffering of the people in New Orleans. ... Finally there is the potential of compensation."" He said he intends to file a lawsuit against LSU, which he said has to pay him through the end of his contract, which ends in May. LSU did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment Thursday. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","Judge: Army Corps of Engineers liable for catastrophic flooding during Katrina .

"(CNN) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs' phone privileges have been suspended, as investigators look into whether he preached from prison, authorities said Tuesday. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice announced last week that it had initiated an investigation into claims that Jeffs used the phone to preach to his congregation on Christmas Day. Records show that Jeffs made two phone calls on Christmas Day, said Jason Clark, a Criminal Justice Department spokesman, who declined to identify the people who lost their phone privileges with Jeffs. ""It would be a violation of the rules if the person called were to place the call on speaker phone or record the conversation. The Office of Inspector General has asked us to suspend the accounts of certain individuals on his calling list while they continue to investigate,"" said Clark. Texas inmates are allowed to call as many as 10 people who have registered with the offender phone system vendor. Calls can be up to 15 minutes in length, and offenders are limited to 240 minutes of phone time per month. All calls are recorded and monitored except those between an inmate and his attorney. Jeffs remains isolated in protective custody in the state's Powledge Unit prison facility near Palestine, Texas. ""He has no cellmate. No prison job. And the only time he leaves it (his cell) is for a shower and recreation,"" Clark said. Jeffs, the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is serving a life-plus-20-year term in Texas for sexual assault. He was convicted in early August of the aggravated sexual assaults of a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old girl that Jeffs claimed were his ""spiritual wives."" The 10,000-member church is a breakaway Mormon sect that openly practices polygamy in the twin border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, as well as on its Yearning For Zion ranch near Eldorado, Texas. The mainstream Mormon church renounced polygamy more than a century ago. Many sect members have disavowed Jeffs over his criminal convictions, while others are defending him and casting his conviction on sexual assault charges as an act of persecution. Last week, a long-time follower of Jeffs said he had been ex-communicated after admitting to having sex with his wife -- a violation of an order that the sect leader apparently issued from behind bars. The church member spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. CNN's Gary Tuchman contributed to this report.","NEW: Warren Jeffs loses his phone privileges for now .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of Chinese criminal suspects living in Angola were sent back to Beijing on a chartered flight over the weekend, state media reported. The 37 suspects were allegedly involved in a variety of crimes, such as kidnapping, human trafficking and forcing women into prostitution, according to the Xinhua news agency. Authorities rescued 14 Chinese victims, who were sent from the capital of Luanda, on the same flight Saturday, Xinhua said. The suspects lured women to Angola with promises of jobs and forced them to engage in prostitution, Chinese police said. Chinese officials worked with authorities in the African nation and dismantled 12 Chinese criminal gangs, the report said. It was the largest crackdown on crimes targeting Chinese nationals in Africa, officials said. ""The joint law enforcement action opened a new chapter in the police cooperation between China and Africa, and will safeguard the safety and other legitimate rights of Chinese citizens and institutions in Angola,"" said Liu Ancheng, director of criminal investigation in China. Angola, which is rich in resources, is a major trading partner with China. Driven by their appetite for natural resources, trade opportunities and political alliances, countries such as China and India are moving from the sidelines to the center stage in Africa. China overtook the United States as Africa's biggest trade partner in 2009. While Western countries are still important players in Africa's energy sector, the deepening engagement of China in Africa's infrastructure, mineral sector and telecommunications is creating ""deep nervousness"" in the West, said David Shinn, the former U.S. ambassador to Burkina Faso and Ethiopia.","The 37 suspects were allegedly involved in a series of crimes, including kidnapping .

"(CNN) -- Almost 10 hours after a United Airlines airplane ran off the runway Monday, crews finally removed the wayward plane from its landing site at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, an airport spokeswoman said. Michelle Wilcut said one runway remained closed as workers filled a deep hole in the nearby sod, but airport officials hoped the labor would be completed in time to reopen the runway later Monday night. The National Transportation Safety Board said the pilot lost braking and steering control during the landing. The hole in the ground formed when the plane's nose gear burrowed into the sod, Wilcut said. No one was injured in the incident, according to FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford. The Airbus A-320, flying as United Flight 497 from New Orleans to San Francisco, was smoking from the nose and made a screeching sound as it landed, a witness told CNN affiliate WVUE in New Orleans. Crews evacuated passengers from the plane using the emergency slides, Lunsford said. The flight was carrying 100 passengers and five crew members, according to United. However, the NTSB said 109 people were on board. The aircraft had returned to the airport about 20 minutes after take-off due to electrical difficulties and smoke in the cockpit, the NTSB said. Airline spokesman Rahsaan Johnson said the airplane experienced an issue with flight instruments. The pilot had asked to land on a longer runway but was diverted to a shorter one because of workers on the first runway, Lunsford said.

""We had some old columns that the old house stood on, and those columns were picked clean, there was nothing left on them,"" he said. Determined, Hadden rebuilt where his boyhood home once stood, both stronger and higher. ""I've got poured concrete pillars filled with steel, 10 times more steel than before,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A man who commandeered a training plane in Canada and led U.S. military aircraft on a seven-hour flight across the Midwest told the officers who found him that he'd hoped he would be shot down, a Missouri state trooper said. Adam Leon told investigators he ""has not felt like himself lately,"" according to an FBI affidavit. ""It was [attempted] suicide,"" said Lt. Jeffrey Vitale of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, one of the first five officers at the scene. ""He was very talkative. He told us everything that was going on. He was very friendly,"" Vitale said. ""He hoped to get shot down by our Air Force."" Adam Dylan Leon, 30, was charged Tuesday with transportation of stolen property and with illegally entering the country, federal prosecutors said. He faces other charges in Canada. ""Leon stated he decided to fly the plane into the United States with the expectation he would be shot down and killed by United States military aircraft,"" according to an FBI affidavit. Leon told investigators that ""he has not felt like himself lately and has been treated recently by a psychiatrist,"" it reads. Leon, also known as Yavuz Berke, stole the Cessna 172 from a flight school in Thunder Bay, Ontario, where he was enrolled in Confederation College's Flight Aviation Management program, authorities said. The school said Leon, a Turkish-born Canadian citizen, initially enrolled in 2006 but had been unable to complete the program. He re-enrolled last fall and was considered a good student, passing his solo cross-country flying test last week, the college said. Faculty at the school described Leon as an excellent student who is personable, mature and very polite. But at 3 p.m. ET Monday, he took off in a stolen plane, apparently intending not to come down alive, according to police. Less than a half-hour after takeoff, he was flying over Lake Superior and into the United States. U.S. F-16 fighter jets intercepted Leon near Michigan's Upper Peninsula border with Wisconsin and tried repeatedly to draw the pilot's attention, authorities said.  Watch how pilot wasn't responding » . At one point, the pilot appeared to acknowledge that he saw the other planes, said Mike Kucharek, a spokesman with the North American Aerospace Defense Command. But the man did not communicate with either NORAD or the FAA, officials said. According to the federal affidavit, Leon said that he saw ""fighters"" shoot flares to get his attention but that he did not acknowledge them. Instead, the plane flew ""erratically"" over the course of the afternoon, Kucharek said, sometimes reaching 14,000 feet in altitude and then dropping as low as 3,000 feet. About 10 p.m. ET, with only about 30 minutes of fuel left, Leon landed the four-seater plane on a dirt road in southern Missouri, parking it under what appeared to be a bridge or culvert -- apparently to hide it -- a federal law enforcement source said.  See a map of the route » . Leon fled into the night. ""Leon did not have any maps and did not know how to get to a local airport to land the plane,"" the affidavit said. ""Leon landed the plane on a rural highway and was later arrested."" Stephanie Reynolds, part owner of the nearby Simmons Grocery and Hardware, said she heard a low-flying plane outside her home. Outside, she could see its lights and another plane ""following it, but it was keeping its distance."" The plane circled the area four or five times and appeared to land, she said. Reynolds said her brother, Darin Tanksley, went looking for the plane and found it abandoned. He called the sheriff and volunteered to stay with the plane. The sheriff rejected that idea, worried that the pilot might be armed and still close by. The sheriff's office told Tanksley that ""Homeland Security"" was keeping an eye on the plane. In fact, a Customs and Border Protection aircraft was using thermal imaging while flying above. Reynolds said she called the clerks at the store to warn them. ""It wasn't another 20 minutes that [the clerk] called and said, 'He's here,' "" Reynolds said. A motorist had picked the pilot up, given him $2 for food and drink, and brought him to the grocery store, Reynolds said. The clerk reported that the pilot went to the bathroom, bought a Gatorade and sat at a booth. Reynolds said she called the police. ""They showed up, and he was still sitting in the booth as if he was waiting,"" she said. Vitale, of the Missouri Highway Patrol, said the officers checked Leon for weapons but did not handcuff him as they asked him questions. Leon told the officers that he did not have identification and that no one was with him. ""He was pretty cooperative,"" Vitale said. ""I know he was kind of waiting for us. He was sitting there waiting for us to come and get him, so he was kind of expecting it. ""It was pretty bizarre, no doubt about it,"" Vitale added. Reynolds said police eventually handcuffed Leon and walked him out. ""He had like a smile on his face,"" she said. ""He didn't seem to be worried at all."" Missouri state troopers initially took Leon into custody, accusing him of illegally flying into U.S. airspace. He was handed over to U.S. immigration officials Tuesday morning and detained on suspicion of illegally entering the United States, according to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Confederation College said that as a student, Leon had access to the planes at the airstrip. ""We are very relieved that the plane landed safely and that no one was hurt,"" college President Patricia Lang said.

"(CNN) -- Texas prison officials have found polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs guilty of ""a major disciplinary infraction"" following an investigation into whether he violated policy by -- among other things -- preaching a Christmas day sermon from prison, a state spokeswoman said Monday. Jeffs' phone privileges have been suspended for 90 days, added Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokeswoman Michelle Lyons. While refusing to elaborate on the content of the conversations, Lyons said that Jeffs was found guilty of making conference calls on several occasions. ""It was obvious to us he was talking to a group of people,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Texas child welfare officials have asked a judge to order a teenage member of a polygamous sect to let them take DNA from her infant so they can determine the father's identity, according to court documents filed in the case. An aerial view taken last year shows some living quarters at polygamist leader Warren Jeffs' Texas ranch. The teenager, who is younger than 18, is a member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She is believed to have had the baby in June, Texas Department of Family and Protective Services attorneys said in the documents, filed earlier this month. Child welfare authorities also believe the teenager was married at 14 to an adult male, department attorney John Dolezal writes in the motion. ""In order to determine the identity of the sexual perpetrator who engaged in sexual intercourse with [the girl] while she was a minor, which act consequently led to this pregnancy, the department is required to perform genetic testing on the child so as to determine who that individual is,"" the motion said. CNN is not naming the teenager, as authorities allege she is a victim of sexual abuse. A hearing on the matter was conducted Tuesday. Patrick Crimmins, spokesman for DFPS, said the teenager showed up without the baby. An agreement was reached by both sides during the hearing, Crimmins said, but the judge ordered that the agreement not be made public. The department has attempted to resolve the issue with the teenager but had not been successful, the motion said. The FLDS was thrust into the spotlight in April, when child welfare workers removed more than 400 children from the sect's Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, citing allegations of physical and sexual abuse. Following a court battle, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the children returned, saying there was no evidence they faced imminent danger of abuse on the ranch. Critics of the FLDS say the sect forces girls into marriage with men. To date, 12 FLDS members have been indicted on charges including sexual assault of a minor, conducting unlawful marriages involving a minor and bigamy as part of an ongoing investigation, according to Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott's office. They include Warren Jeffs, the FLDS leader and ""prophet."" Jeffs was already facing charges of sexual assault of a child in Texas, which carries a sentence of up to life upon conviction, when he was indicted earlier this month on a first-degree felony count of aggravated sexual assault. He is also facing a sentence of up to life in Utah, where he was convicted on accomplice to rape charges for his role in the marriage of a sect member to a 14-year-old. He is awaiting trial in Arizona, where he faces similar charges. The FLDS is a 10,000-member offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church. It openly practices polygamy on the ranch, as well as in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona border.","Texas child welfare officials trying to determine father's identity .

Rebel brigades have had the sprawling military base in a stranglehold for days. Read more: Syrian boy risks life for stranger . A rebel commander told CNN in early December that at least 250 government soldiers had defected since the infantry academy came under siege, with most joining the rebel forces. The Free Syrian Army now has control of most of the base, the opposition Local Coordination Committees for Syria said Saturday. Heavy clashes were also reported between regime forces and rebel fighters in and around the town of Daraya, near the capital, Damascus. Watch: Patriot missiles a warning to Syria's al-Assad . Regime forces are shelling parts of the city, which has been under siege for weeks, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Observatory also reported shelling by government security forces of the northeastern towns of Harasta and Erbeen, in the Damascus suburbs, Saturday morning. There are also clashes between rebel fighters and regime forces along the main highway that passes southern Damascus, it said. The LCC reported airstrikes by fighter jets on southern neighborhoods of the capital. At least 60 people died across the country on Saturday, including 20 in Damascus and its suburbs, the LCC reported. CNN cannot independently confirm government or opposition claims about violence and casualties as Syria has severely restricted access for journalists. Syria's Foreign Minister Walid Moallem called for an end to U.S. and European Union sanctions against his country in a meeting with U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos in Damascus on Saturday, according to Syria's official news agency, SANA. Moaellem said the sanctions were responsible for the Syrian people's suffering and urged the United Nations to condemn them. He also called on Amos for U.N. help to reconstruct infrastructure such as hospitals damaged during the 22-month conflict, SANA said. The U.N. secretary general's special representative for children and armed conflict, Leila Zerrougui, also arrived in the capital Friday to assess the impact of the conflict on the country's children, the news agency said.

SANA also reported that government forces had continued their mission Friday to clear areas and neighborhoods in Deir Ezzor, in the country's east, from ""mercenary terrorists."" The Syrian government refers to the rebel forces as terrorists. U.S. officials said Friday that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's control is crumbling at an accelerating pace.

The United States and Germany are sending Patriot missiles and troops to the Turkish border in order to protect their fellow NATO member from potential threats from Syria. The surface-to-air interceptors would be ""dealing with threats that come out of Syria,"" said U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta Friday. Threats would include Syrian strikes inside Turkey and fighting between the government and rebels that extends into Turkey. Errant Syrian artillery shells struck the Turkish border town of Akcakale and killed five Turkish civilians in October. The United States has accused Damascus of launching Scud-type artillery from the capital at rebels in the country's north. One Washington official said missiles came close to the border of Turkey, a staunch U.S. ally. Syria's government called the accusations ""untrue rumors"" Friday, according to state news agency SANA. Damascus accused Turkey and its partners of instigating rumors to make the government look bad internationally. Read more: Refugee figures fail to give true picture of Syria crisis . Reports that the Syrian government may be considering the use of chemical weapons have also heightened international concerns in recent days. Syria denies it has such weapons and says it would not use them even if it did. The Syrian civil war started in March 2011 when a government crackdown on civilian demonstrators morphed into a fight between the regime and rebels. The conflict has a proxy element, with Sunni countries such as Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia backing the rebels and Shiite Iran backing the Alawite regime. The Alawite faith is an offshoot of Shiite Islam. More than 40,000 people have died in the war. The United Nations said on Friday that many Syrians will continue to be killed and maimed after the war ends because of deadly explosives placed in residential areas across the country.

Gasps filled the courtroom and some had to be restrained by sheriff's deputies as they tried to rush the defense table after Derrick Donchak, 19, and Brandon Piekarsky, 17, were acquitted of aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and ethnic intimidation for the death of Luis Ramirez. Piekarsky was also found not guilty of third-degree murder for the death of Ramirez, who died of blunt force injuries after an encounter with the teens last summer. However, the all-white jury of six men and six women from Schuylkill County jury found Piekarsky and Donchak guilty of simple assault. The case drew national attention to the small town of Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, highlighting race relations and polarizing the community on who was to blame for the incident. Lawyers for the teens never denied that their clients were involved in a physical altercation with Ramirez on a residential street the night of July 12. Instead, they tried to cast Ramirez as the aggressor, and suggested that the other teens involved in the tangle of punches and blows were to blame. ""In my mind it was the lack of evidence to tie these kids to the serious charges that they brought,"" defense lawyer Frederick Fanelli said. A cast of witnesses provided conflicting accounts regarding who initiated the encounter and who exactly did what, complicating prosecutors' efforts to assign blame. ""If you ask most prosecutors who are dealing with multiple defendants, and in this particular case there were at least four, it is extraordinary difficult to clear the fog of a fight,"" truTV anchor Ashleigh Banfield said. The 25-year-old Mexican immigrant had settled in Shenandoah a year before his death with his wife, a lifelong resident of the faltering mining town, and their young children. He was walking down a residential street with a friend when he encountered the group of teens, who had been drinking earlier in the evening. Donchak was convicted of providing alcohol to the other teens who were involved in the confrontation, including a juvenile co-defendant and another teen who pleaded guilty in federal court for his role in the fight. Prosecutors alleged that the teens baited the Ramirez into a fight with racial epithets, provoking an exchange of punches and kicks that ended with Ramirez convulsing in the street, foaming from the mouth. He died two days later in a hospital. Piekarsky was accused of delivering a fatal kick to Ramirez's head after he was knocked to the ground. As they poured out of courthouse, the teens' supporters shouted ""I was right from the start"" and ""I'm glad the jury listened"" at cameras that caught the late-night verdict. But Gladys Limon, a spokeswoman for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said the jury had sent a troubling message. ""The jurors here [are] sending the message that you can brutally beat a person, without regard to their life, and get away with it, continue with your life uninterrupted,"" she said. ""In this case, the message is that a person who may not be popular in society based on their national origin or certain characteristic has less value in our society,"" she said. The extent of Ramirez's injuries, which had left his brain oozing from his skull, according to medical testimony, should have sufficed for a conviction other than simple assault, Limon said. ""The acts here were egregious in brutality and it's just outrageous and very difficult to understand how any juror could have had reasonable doubt, especially as to the aggravated assault and the reckless enganderment charges,"" she said. Limon said her group intends to press the Department of Justice to file federal charges against the teens. ""Luis Ramirez's family deserves vindication for his death,"" she said. ""This incident has not only disrupted Luis Ramirez's family, but the entire community.""

"San Angelo, Texas (CNN) -- Texas prosecutors rested their case Wednesday in the sexual assault trial of polygamous sect leader Warren Jeffs after playing a key piece of evidence for jurors: an audiotape they allege documents his sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl. One juror wiped her eyes as she listened to the recording. Another looked at Jeffs out of the corner of her eye. Still another had a hand covering her mouth. The tape contained praying at the beginning and end, and in it a man alleged by prosecutors to be Jeffs addresses the alleged victim by name. At one point, the man asked her how she feels, and a girl replies in a small voice, ""I feel fine, thank you."" At another point, the man appears to address other people who are present. ""It was very hard to listen to,"" CNN's Gary Tuchman said of the recording. Authorities seized it from the car Jeffs was traveling in when he was arrested in 2006. Jeffs, the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is charged with two counts of sexual assault on a child and one count of bigamy stemming from a 2008 raid on a ranch near Eldorado, Texas, operated by his church. He is expected to be tried on the bigamy charge later. Judge Barbara Walther told Jeffs, who is representing himself, that he could begin presenting the defense case after a lunch recess. On Tuesday, the jury heard audio recordings that prosecutors said showed Jeffs instructing a 14-year-old victim and his other young ""wives"" on how to sexually please him in order to win God's favor. Jeffs repeatedly and loudly objected to the playing of the recordings on religious grounds. Each time, Walther overruled him. There can be ""no claim of privilege, regardless of the religion, with respect to communications directly relevant to sexual assault of a child,"" prosecutor Eric Nichols said when the judge invited him to respond to Jeffs' outbursts. Prosecutors said the tapes show Jeffs offering ""celestial marriage"" instructions to his young wives, telling them that tending to his needs will bring them closer to God. ""You have to know how to be sexually excited and to help each other ... and you have to be ready for the time I need your comfort,"" a man's voice says. ""This is your mission. This is how you abide the law,"" the man adds. Many jurors lowered their heads and closed their eyes as they listened to the recordings. At one point, the man says, ""Take your clothes off. Do it right now."" The sounds of crying followed. ""Just don't think about the pain; you're going to heaven,"" the man says at one point. ""The world's view of sexual relations is selfish; the celestial view is not,"" he says at another. The recordings were among the items confiscated during the raid on the ranch. Before the court adjourned Tuesday night, jurors were shown a photograph of a closet where 12 white robes hung. A closeup of one of the robes showed a label with the name of one of the purported victims. Prosecutors said the girls wore the robes during these ""heavenly sessions."" One of the sexual assault victims was 14 at the time of her marriage to Jeffs, prosecutors said. She bore a child by him when she was 15, they said. If convicted, Jeffs could face a sentence of five years to life for the charge of aggravated sexual assault regarding the alleged 12-year-old. For the other count, he faces a sentence of two to 20 years. Tuesday's objections to the audio recording were the latest in a series of objections on religious grounds that Jeffs has made. He also objected repeatedly to witness testimony about records authorities seized in the 2008 ranch raid. At one point, Walther asked the jury to leave and then asked state prosecutors whether they wanted Jeffs to be removed from the courtroom. Prosecutors said they wanted Jeffs to stay and participate, following court rules. Prosecutors called three witnesses Tuesday. The last, Texas Ranger Nick Hanna, took the stand for 10 hours -- laying out the family background of one of the girls, when and where she married Jeffs and the date of her daughter's birth. Jeffs' trial started last week. He remained silent for more than a day of the trial proceedings. But on Friday, he began repeatedly objecting -- at one point responding with an hourlong speech about his religious freedom ""being trampled upon."" He objected to an FBI agent's testimony Friday on the grounds that it violated religious freedom, claiming FBI agents ""touched upon what we find sacred to salvation."" ""This must stop, in a land ... where we maintain the constitutional right of religious freedom,"" he said. ""We are not a fly-by-night religious organization that just appeared within your borders. Mockery must cease. This is sacred to us, and must remain sacred."" Prosecutors responded that Jeffs' First Amendment arguments were not valid in this case. Over frequent interruptions by Jeffs, they argued that freedom of religion does not extend to polygamy or infringing on a child's rights. The judge previously told jurors that she expected the trial could last two to three weeks. But that was before Jeffs won the right to represent himself on Thursday. Jeffs' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10,000 followers. Their practice of polygamy, which the mainstream Mormon Church renounced more than a century ago, is part of the sect's doctrine. Jeffs was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list when he was arrested five years ago during a routine 2006 traffic stop in Las Vegas. He was convicted in Utah of two counts of being an accomplice to rape for using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marrying her 19-year-old cousin. Afterward, he was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms of five years to life. But in July 2010, the Utah Supreme Court overturned his convictions, ruling that the jury instructions were erroneous. Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said last week Utah is prepared to retry Jeffs, depending on the outcome of the Texas case. The Texas legal proceedings were set off after about 400 children were taken from the sect's Yearning for Zion ranch in 2008. Child protection officials said they found a ""pervasive pattern"" of sexual abuse on the ranch through forced marriages between underage girls and older men. But the Texas Supreme Court ruled the state had no right to remove the children. The court also said the state lacked evidence to show that the children faced imminent danger of abuse. Most of the children were returned to their families, although some men at the ranch were charged with sexual abuse.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- If we want to build a stronger, more sustainable world for future generations, one with more partners and fewer enemies, we have to work together. Former President Bill Clinton says that everyone can do something to improve the lives of others. The challenges of our day transcend politics, religion, geography and gender -- and in turn, so must we. This has been a month of historical calamities, natural and man-made, from Haiti to Wall Street, but the work of the Clinton Global Initiative shows that corporate responsibility needn't fluctuate with the market. This week almost 60 heads of state, hundreds of CEOs, five Nobel Peace Prize laureates, dozens of leading philanthropists and global leaders -- including both U.S. presidential candidates -- are taking part in our fourth CGI Annual Meeting. We launched it in 2005 with a simple concept: Invite a diverse group of global leaders to New York City, challenge them to work together on the world's most pressing challenges, give them concrete opportunities to do so, and require that in order to return the next year, they make a commitment to take action to address a global challenge of their choice. Since we started, the leaders at CGI have made more than 1,000 ""commitments to action"" valued at more than $30 billion to improve the lives of 200 million people in 150 countries. This Wednesday, we'll see returning faces, and also many leaders who will be attending for the first time. As we have in years past, we'll be discussing many of the major challenges of our time, including poverty and economic empowerment, energy and climate change, health and education. One of the most important conversations will be about global warming and the specific clean energy opportunities that we have -- at all levels of government and society -- to create jobs, increase growth, enhance security, fight global warming and sustain our sources of food and clean water. I'm honored that Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain have agreed to talk about these issues with us. While CGI brings leaders together to discuss and learn about issues, our real focus is on action -- and on measurable results. CGI participants' commitments have given 8 million children access to improved education and 11 million access to better health care. More than 4 million people have been reached with clean energy services, and more than 3 million have increased access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Forty-two million children have benefited from interventions that address malnutrition or under nutrition. These impacts and their ripples are reshaping our world, and strengthening the bonds of our common purpose and humanity. This year, we're building on this energy and expanding CGI to more people in more regions. In March, we held the first meeting of CGI U at Tulane University in New Orleans. Hundreds of college students and university officials from the United States and other nations attended and made commitments that range from reducing greenhouse gas emissions on their campuses to creating medical backpacks for roving doctors in Africa. Everyone at CGI U -- including Brad Pitt and myself -- also worked on a service project in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans, helping to prepare construction sites for new homes for people who had been uprooted by Hurricane Katrina. In the spirit of building a world with more partners and fewer enemies, I'll be traveling to Hong Kong this December for the first meeting of CGI outside of New York. This meeting will include leaders and issues of importance in Asia, an increasingly important part of the 21st century world. Asian leaders have a large and growing capacity to shape our economy, climate, health and security, and I'm honored that Lee Kuan Yew and other leaders already have confirmed their participation. You don't need to be rich or powerful to do something to make a difference. People from more than 190 countries already have made their own commitment using our Web site. No matter how much or how little money you have in your pocket, or the amount of free time in your week, or your talents and interests, you can do something to improve the lives of others, and in so doing, strengthen the fabric of our shared humanity. That is what CGI is all about. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Bill Clinton: This has been a month of challenges, from hurricanes to Wall Street .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Nearly 10 years after the deadly crash of an Air France Concorde jet, a trial began Tuesday to determine who's to blame for the doomed flight. The judge began the trial by reading out the names of all 113 people who were killed when the plane burst into flames and smashed into a hotel on July 25, 2000. Three French people responsible for the design, testing and certification of the Concorde face charges of involuntary manslaughter. Also on trial are Continental Airlines and two of its American employees, accused of the same crime because a Continental Airlines jet was found to have played a key role in the crash. The Americans were not present for the opening day. The head of an organization representing the victims of disasters criticized the trial as it began. Stephane Giquel of Fenvac said the trial would be a dehumanized battle of experts as Continental and Air France sought to blame each other. Air France is not on trial. A lawyer representing Continental said Concorde's problems were apparent decades before the crash. Then-French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing told his Council of Ministers in 1980 that the Concorde needed to be improved, lawyer Olivier Metzner said Tuesday. Jacques Chirac, who was president at the time of the Concorde crash, saw it take place and reportedly said Concorde is dead, Metzner said. In fact, that is what Giscard d'Estaing should have said in 1980, he argued. Metzner said the trial should be suspended because it is not fair to Continental, but presiding judge Dominique Andreassier said she would not rule on the request until after some expert testimony, which could take months. An investigation revealed a tragic chain of events that brought down Air France Flight 4590 shortly after takeoff from Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport: A tire under the left wing blew on takeoff when it struck a small strip of titanium metal on the runway. The blown tire sent debris into the wing, causing the fuel tank to rupture and sparking the catastrophic fire that led to the crash, which killed 100 passengers, nine crew and four people on the ground. Metzner said the plane was on fire before it hit the metal fragment. According to the charges, the Concorde engineers on trial could have acted much earlier to correct well-known design flaws in the plane, whose tanks had insufficient protection from debris. Prosecutors are likely to present evidence that because of its higher-than-normal takeoff speeds, there were more than 60 tire blowouts over the Concorde's 25 years in the air. Only one Concorde ever crashed. The titanium strip that is said to have played a major role in the crash allegedly fell off a Continental DC-10, which took off just before the Concorde. Judicial investigators say the strip was improperly installed on the DC-10 engine, prompting the charges against the airline and two of its employees. Air France and British Airways introduced supersonic commercial service in 1976, but the disaster, combined with high maintenance costs and falling passenger numbers, led both airlines to retire the Concorde fleet in 2003. The trial is expected to last about four months. CNN's Jim Bittermann and Alix Bayle contributed to this report .","NEW: Lawyer urges suspension of trial; judge wants expert testimony .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- New Orleans, Louisiana, Mayor Ray Nagin arrived in Cuba late Friday on a mission to learn about how to deal with storms, a spokeswoman said. Mayor Ray Nagin watches President Obama speak in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Thursday. ""We understand we may have a lot to learn from the Cubans in terms of disaster preparedness and how they have dealt with hurricanes,"" spokeswoman Ceeon Quiett said. Cuba is internationally applauded for exceptional disaster management, according to a news release from Nagin's office. In the Cuban capital, Havana, Nagin plans to meet with several officials, including some from the Latin American Medical Centers for Disaster. He will also learn about preparations the Cuba Defense Committee makes in advance of disasters. Nagin's trip comes a day after President Obama held a town hall meeting in New Orleans, still reeling from the aftermath of deadly Hurricane Katrina in 2005. ""It has now been just over four years since that terrible storm struck your shores,"" the president said. ""And [in] the days after it did, this nation and all the world bore witness to the fact that the damage from Katrina was not caused just by a disaster of nature but also by a breakdown of government, that government wasn't adequately prepared, and we didn't appropriately respond."" Since Katrina, New Orleans has adjusted its disaster response with new evacuation plans. As Hurricane Gustav threatened the city last year, officials evacuated more than 18,000 residents, the release said. Three powerful hurricanes hit Cuba last year, damaging half a million homes and causing $10 billion in losses, according to the Cuban government. But only seven people died, thanks to a smooth evacuation plan. Some aspects of the communist nation's response, including mandatory evacuations, may not be possible in a democracy. Still, some Americans believe that they can learn from their Caribbean neighbor. The mayor of Galveston, Texas, another city hit hard by Gulf of Mexico hurricanes, visited Cuba this year. Nagin is the first New Orleans mayor to make an official visit to Cuba in 50 years. The State Department sanctioned Nagin's trip, Quiett said. He plans to return to New Orleans on Thursday. CNN's David Ariosto contributed to this report.","Ray Nagin to meet with Cuban officials, learn about disaster plans .

"San Angelo, Texas (CNN) -- A Texas judge warned Warren Jeffs against calling ""for the jury's destruction"" shortly after the polygamous sect leader said Friday during his sexual assault trial that those who prosecuted his church would face ""sickness and death."" The comments that precipitated the warning to Jeffs, who has been granted the right to represent himself, occurred around midday after Judge Barbara Walther had sent the jury out of the San Angelo courtroom. ""I, the Lord God of heaven, ask the courts to cease the prosecution of my holy ways,"" Jeffs said. ""There will be a judgment against all those who prosecute the church. ... I shall let all people know of your unjust ways. I will bring sickness and death. Let this cease."" Walther then told him that ""if you call for the jury's destruction"" while the jury -- who will decide if Jeffs is guilty on two counts of sexual assault on a child -- is present, ""you will be removed from the courtroom."" The defendant responded by saying, ""I am not threatening. I am releasing a message."" The exchange was one of several contentious ones Friday, when the one-man defense team ended his self-imposed silence by repeatedly interrupting prosecutors and launching into a diatribe on religious freedom. Jeffs' trial stems from a 2008 raid on a ranch near Eldorado, Texas, run by his church, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. This trial addresses the two sexual assault counts, while Jeffs is expected to be tried later on a related bigamy charge. Several people took the stand Friday, including a doctor who conducted DNA tests on one of Jeffs' alleged sexual assault victims and her baby; a Texas child protective services agent who took part in the raid; and an FBI agent who took various items from the ranch. Representing himself, Jeffs interrupted when FBI agent Jeff Broadway began to describe what he found on a computer seized in the raid. Broadway said the computer contained lists of people living at the ranch, including their names, ages and birthdays. Jeffs then spent about an hour objecting to Broadway's testimony on the grounds that it violated religious freedom, claiming the FBI agents ""touched upon what we find sacred to salvation."" ""This must stop, in a land ... where we maintain the constitutional right of religious freedom,"" he said. ""We are not a fly-by-night religious organization that just appeared within your borders. Mockery must cease. This is sacred to us, and must remain sacred."" But prosecutors responded that Jeffs' First Amendment arguments were not valid in this case. Over frequent interruptions by Jeffs -- including more than six in a row -- they argued that freedom of religion does not extend to polygamy or infringing on a child's rights. The judge later advised Jeffs to seek counsel from his former attorney. Ruby Gutierrez of the Texas Department of Families and Protective Services, who was one of those who took custody of the children after the raid, testified that the 12-year-old girl whom Jeffs alleged sexually assaulted resembled Pippi Longstocking with her red hair and freckles. Jeffs objected to the girl's picture being shown in court, and argued that her name should not be released. A Texas Ranger who was part of the raid, Don Williams, described to jurors how he went into the compound's temple. Jeffs interrupted him on numerous occasions, calling his testimony ""an intrusion, a desecration of sacredness."" ""I'm requesting true justice and protection of religion,"" the defendant said. Jeffs had voiced similar views Thursday, when he argued that he felt no counsel could adequately represent him in order for ""true justice to be served."" After warning him of the challenges of representing himself, Walther granted Jeffs' request to effectively fire his attorneys. But the judge declined to push back the opening arguments, which were scheduled for later that afternoon. Prosecutor Eric Nichols told jurors that they would hear an audiotape documenting the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl. He also promised to present DNA evidence proving that Jeffs fathered a baby girl with a 14-year-old girl. But when the time came for Jeffs -- who had been verbose earlier in the day -- to talk, he instead sat quiet. He remained that way, with his head down, for about a minute as jurors looked back and forth between him and the judge. Walther said she understood that, by Jeffs' silence, he had chosen not to give a statement. Then she gave prosecutors the go-ahead to start calling witnesses. The judge previously had told jurors that she expected the trial could last two to three weeks. But that was before Jeffs won the right to represent himself. On Friday, prosecutors said that they had worked late into the night readjusting their approach and vowed to rest their case by next Tuesday. Jeffs' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10,000 followers. Their practice of polygamy, which the mainstream Mormon Church renounced more than a century ago, is part of their doctrine. The sect's leader, Jeffs, was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list when he was arrested five years ago during a routine 2006 traffic stop in Las Vegas. He was convicted in Utah of two counts of being an accomplice to rape, for using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marrying her 19-year-old cousin. Afterward, he was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms of five years to life. But in July 2010, the Utah Supreme Court overturned his convictions, ruling that the jury instructions were erroneous. Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff told HLN this week that he would be open to putting Jeffs on trial again in his state. Meanwhile, the Texas legal proceedings were set off after about 400 children were taken from the sect's Yearning for Zion ranch in 2008. Child protection officials said they found a ""pervasive pattern"" of sexual abuse on the ranch through forced marriages between underage girls and older men. But the Texas Supreme Court ruled the state had no right to remove the children. The court also said the state lacked evidence to show that the children faced imminent danger of abuse.

"(CNN) -- Pinning down a prophet is lonely work. Just ask Mohave County, Arizona, investigator Gary Engels. Gary Engels investigates the FLDS as an investigator for the Mohave County prosecutor's office in Arizona. The plain-spoken Engels' sole focus since October 2004 has been to pursue Warren Jeffs and his polygamist sect in Colorado City, Arizona, a town on the state line across from Hildale, Utah. He hasn't gotten a lot of help from the locals, including the police, whose loyalties have been called into question. A state oversight board has stripped six members of Colorado City's tiny police force of their badges since 2003 -- all members of Jeffs' FLDS church. Some were decertified for  having plural wifes and others for failing to help catch Jeffs when he was a fugitive, according to The Associated Press. Read . Townsfolk turn their backs on Engels when he tries to talk to them, and most of those who do talk are evasive, says the former police officer. ""There is nobody that works in this city, that works for this city, that is not a loyal FLDS member, and that's from the mayor all the way through the employees right down to the last marshal here, and the last police officer that works here is loyal to Warren Jeffs,"" Engels told CNN. ""It's my experience ... that these police officers are not real police officers. They're enforcers for the FLDS church. They're enforcers for Warren,"" he said in another interview. ""I know that if it comes down to it, I can't count on them at all for backup,"" he said. ""In fact, I believe that if guns started being pointed, that their guns would probably be pointed at me."" The FLDS is the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the polygamous sect that Jeffs runs. The FLDS, now with perhaps 10,000 adherents, broke away from the Mormon church more than a century ago when the latter disavowed polygamy. It was Engels' investigation that led to Jeffs' arrest on charges including being an accomplice to rape. The charges stem from Jeffs' alleged practice of arranging marriages between adult male followers and underage brides. Closing arguments are set Friday in Jeffs' trial across the state line in St. George, Utah. The FLDS leader also faces similar charges in Arizona. So far, Engels has steered clear of the Utah trial. But his investigation is ongoing. Ever since his office was burglarized, the investigator always carries his files with him, he told Court TV, which is part of CNN's parent company, Time Warner. Engels' work might be lonely, but he's rarely alone. He says he is followed by young men in vehicles with tinted windows every time he shows up in the sect's stronghold. ""Sometimes if they're stopped at a stop sign or something, they'll try to take off real fast, throwing gravel on my vehicle,"" he told CNN. ""Or the diesels, you know, they'll accelerate real fast, blowing a lot of black smoke out."" But he has never let the surveillance and the glares stop him. He is on a mission. ""I think, eventually, justice will win out,"" he told CNN shortly after Jeffs' arrest. ""If I didn't, I couldn't continue to do this. So we just keep pushing and pushing, and -- and see where it leads us. I'm not -- I'm not done yet. I'm not ready to give up."" He elaborated in a 2005 interview with National Public Radio. ""I would just love to see this whole community brought back into the United States, where everybody has equal rights,"" he said. ""These people don't have the right to voice their opinion. They don't have the right to criticize,"" he told NPR. ""If they do, then they stand to lose their house, they stand to lose their family, and they stand to lose their job, and most important to most of these people, they stand to lose their salvation."" Engels said he's not necessarily interested in stopping the practice of polygamy, according to Court TV. ""When I first got here, it was still a shock,"" he told Court TV. ""I don't even think about it anymore. There are some families up there where polygamy works for them, and some [where] it doesn't. But I think it has to be done among consenting adults."" That's why prosecutions in the case have focused on statutory rape charges. The case has been built by comparing dates on marriage and birth certificates to identify girls who became pregnant by older men before the girls were 16, too young for sex under Arizona law. ""If they get them young enough and get a couple of children, then it makes it very difficult for them to leave,"" he told CNN. ""And the fact that the women are not educated or taught how to deal or take care of themselves in the outside world is another issue."" He doubts change will come quickly to this corner of the desert, even if Jeffs is convicted. ""I think that there are the die-hards that will always consider him the prophet,"" Engels said. ""There are those that are probably questioning it right now."" He said he'll be satisfied if the trial lets women in the FLDS know they have other choices. ""I hope that it will empower some of the women there who may be thinking about wanting to get out, to go ahead and get out."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer has finally won the only grand slam tournament to elude him after beating Sweden's Robin Soderling in straight sets to claim the French Open title at Roland Garros. Federer is the French Open champion at last after beating Robin Soderling in straight sets at Roland Garros. The Swiss world number two had 13 grand slam successes to his name prior to the event, but none of them had been on the Parisian red clay. However, that changed on Sunday as the 27-year-old cruised to a 6-1 7-6 6-4 victory over 23rd seed Soderling, the man who had caused a sensation by dumping four-time winner Rafael Nadal out of the tournament earlier in the week. The victory moves Federer onto 14 career grand slam titles, level with American Pete Sampras as the most successful grand slam player in men's tennis history. He also moved into a select group made up only of Fred Perry, Don Budge, Rod Laver, Roy Emerson and Andre Agassi as men who have won all four of the grand slam events. ""It was probably my greatest ever victory, I was under big pressure. But I did it and it's phenomenal,"" an emotional Federer told a packed crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier -- before breaking down in tears after being presented with the trophy by American Agassi, the 1999 French Open champion and last player to win all four slams. ""I think that now and until the end of my career, I can really play with my mind at peace and no longer hear that I've never won Roland Garros,"" he added. You say: Is Roger Federer the greatest tennis player in history? Soderling, who beat Nadal and Nikolay Davydenko en route to the final, told the crowd: ""I had the two best weeks of my career. Roger is a really worthy winner. To me he is the best player in history so he really deserves to win here at the French as well."" The 27-year-old Federer, playing in his 19th grand slam final, could not have wished for a better start under threatening skies, which produced drizzling rain for the majority of the match. The Swiss dropped just one point on his serve in three games, but, in contrast, Soderling's serve was far from convincing and he soon trailed 4-0. Soderling got on the scoreboard in the fifth game but he had already been broken twice by then. In the seventh game, the Swede was facing two set points when a rasping Federer forehand flew past him. Soderling saved the first with an unreturnable serve but on the second, Federer unleashed a whipped backhand for the set. The second set, which did not have a single break of serve, was overshadowed by an incident which saw Federer come face to face with a court invader at the start of the fourth game. How it happened: See the French Open final in photos » . The man, wearing a top bearing the word 'Switzerland' on its chest, came down from high up in the stands and vaulted the barriers to enter the court. He ran up to Federer and brandished in front of the player's face what appeared to be a flag of Spanish team Barcelona. He then attempted to put a cap on the head of Federer, who retreated way behind the service line. Security took their time coming onto the court to aid Federer but when they did, they managed to accost the invader, who by that time had frantically run across the court and leapt the net. Federer at first appeared shaken -- he lost the next game to love -- admittedly on Soderling's serve, but calm was soon restored as the rain started to come down and the set went to a tie-break. Federer played it flawlessly, smashing down four aces from four serves to clinch it in style. He then grabbed the key break in the third set in the very first game. Soderling by that time had got over his early-match jitters but he could not halt Federer's juggernaut of a serve. He only earned his first break point of the match in the fourth game of that set, but the Swiss came up with a fine forehand passing shot to save. Serving for the match, Federer went break point down again to add to the drama. Soderling wasted that with a mis-hit and then netted a return into the net two points later to hand Federer the title.","Roger Federer finally wins French Open title with victory over Robin Soderling .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Andrew Cattaneo is still in shock. It's been only a day since his neighbor across the street, Melissa Ketunuti, was found dead in the basement of her row home Monday afternoon, her hands and feet bound, her body set on fire. Standing in the doorway of his home, Cattaneo watched as police detectives returned to the scene Tuesday while news reporters huddled nearby trying to stay warm on the blustery January afternoon. ""She was very pleasant, very nice, very friendly and quiet,"" Cattaneo said, looking across the street. ""It's very upsetting."" Although authorities were awaiting the final autopsy report, Philadelphia Police Capt. James Clark, homicide commanding officer, said at a news conference Tuesday morning that Ketunuti, a 35-year-old physician, apparently was strangled. There were no immediately obvious signs of sexual assault, Clark said. Ketunuti lived alone with her dog Pooch on a quiet, narrow and tree-lined street in Philadelphia's Center City. It was her dog walker, police said, who discovered her smoldering body. The investigation is ongoing, Clark said, and the motive for her death is unclear. Police continued to canvass the neighborhood Tuesday in search of surveillance video. Police say Ketunuti stopped at several stores Monday before making her way home, and there were no signs of struggle, indicating that she may have been followed. ""We don't know if she walked in on individuals inside of her property, we don't know if individuals forced her inside her property, or whether or not she knew her killer,"" Clark said. ""We're not closing any avenues."" In 2008, Ketunuti moved from Washington to Philadelphia, where she was a pediatrics resident at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""This is hopefully the last move for at least 3 years, given that's how long it should take to finish a pediatrics residency,"" she penned on her personal online blog where she chronicled her globe-trekking adventures and updated her progress with school. ""As sexy as it was to be a life-saving surgeon, I feel much better suited for pediatrics,"" she wrote. Her postings referred to a surgery internship at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, and a second internship in cardiothoracic surgery at a veterans hospital. Across the street from Ketunuti's house, another neighbor who did not want to be identified was visibly upset at the news of her death. ""Who would want to do this?"" the neighbor said. The neighbor described Ketunuti as a private person, but not unfriendly. ""I'm struggling for the logic to why my friend is dead,"" the neighbor said, fighting back tears. ""I'm sick with this."" The neighbor said Ketunuti was often seen running long distances, and returning home with groceries, that she had very few visitors, and that Ketunuti spent a significant amount of time at the hospital. That was a point reiterated by police. ""She dedicated her whole life to being a doctor and helping kids with cancer,"" Clark said. ""It's very unfortunate that she died in this manner."" Ketunuti graduated with a doctorate in medicine from Stanford University in 2007. Over the years, she completed a clerkship in Botswana, as well as internships at New York University and Johns Hopkins, she wrote on her blog. No arrests had been made or suspects identified in the case as of Tuesday, according to police, and there is a $20,000 reward for arrest and conviction in relation to the killing. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia released a statement Tuesday afternoon saying Ketunuti was a second-year infectious diseases fellow and researcher. She had been at the hospital for five years, the statement said, and had also served as a resident in the Department of Pediatrics. ""Melissa was a warm, caring, earnest, bright young woman with her whole future ahead of her,"" Dr. Paul Offit, chief of the hospital's division of infectious diseases, said in an e-mail statement. ""But more than that, she was admired, respected and loved by those with whom she worked here ... Her death will have a profound impact on those who worked with her and we will all miss her deeply.""","Melissa Ketunuti was a doctor at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia .

"(CNN) -- On the morning of August 5, my uncle, Satwant Singh Kaleka, and five other innocent people were gunned down in our place of worship, the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The tragedy left us wondering what it will take to stem the growing tide of hate crimes and violence plaguing our nation. The Senate is holding a hearing on domestic terrorism on Wednesday, and I hope it will do more than simply offer my community a chance to vent frustrations and appeal for sympathy. My hope is that the hearing provides an opportunity for Americans to come together and identify solutions. We need to be aware that the killings in Oak Creek, as well as recent attacks on the mosque in Joplin, Missouri, and more than a dozen others across the country, will continue if we turn a blind eye to domestic terrorism. It is a significant, growing threat to our safety and freedom as Americans. We must ensure our safety within our own borders before we can hope to address violence elsewhere. According to the FBI, between 1980 and 2001, two-thirds of terrorist attacks in America were carried out by non-Islamic American extremists. That rose to 95% between 2002 and 2005. A recent study by the New America Foundation found that non-Islamic U.S. citizens were behind 10 attacks from 9/11 through 2011, while jihadists carried out four. During the same time, 11 white supremacist, anarchist or right-wing extremists were caught with biological or chemical weapons -- anthrax, cyanide, ricin or sarin -- and four attempted to acquire them. The study found not a single jihadist terrorist possessed or tried to acquire chemical or biological weapons. Eleven years after 9/11, who are the terrorists? Even more worrying is that  radical right groups are growing explosively, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Yet appallingly, our government has not only failed to increase its efforts to monitor this threat, but in 2009, it decreased efforts, leaving only one staffer in the Department of Homeland Security's domestic terrorism unit, according to Daryl Johnson, a senior domestic terrorism analyst from 2004 to 2010. We know there are at least 1,018 domestic hate groups in the United States today, many of which promote and explicitly call for violence against those of a different skin color, religion or ideology. How long can we keep our heads in the sand, and how long must we sit by as more innocent people die because a person decides that he won't tolerate the cultural or religious diversity of our nation -- our melting pot? A coward killed my uncle. A coward, not because he went into a place of worship and took the lives of six unarmed people, and not because he took his own life rather than facing the consequences of his actions. He was a coward because he didn't have the courage to see the humanity of the people around him. He -- like all terrorists -- killed people because they were not like him, because they were different. The reality is we are all different from one another, and that means we are all potential targets for such violence. This problem affects each and every one of us, so it's imperative that we act decisively, and act now. This is not a problem that is simply going to go away. The government agencies charged with defending our freedom and safety must make it a priority to fight terrorism not just abroad, but right here at home. And we as the citizens must rid ourselves of the hate speech and the xenophobia -- including Islamophobia -- that divides us. This is particularly true of our leaders. Opinion: What if U.S. stops policing the world? We cannot give into the cowardice of prejudice. As the great Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, ""We are a nation of many nationalities, many races, many religions -- bound together by a single unity, the unity of freedom and equality."" Together we can -- together we must -- address this challenge by calling on our elected officials to do their duty: defend the safety and freedom we as all Americans cherish.

"New York (CNN) -- On the same day that a defense attorney was assigned to Maksim Gelman, accused of killing four during a New York City stabbing and carjacking spree, one of his surviving victims recalled the terror he felt during the alleged rampage. During a court hearing Monday, Gelman was appointed a defense attorney -- public defender Ed Friedman. Sunday night, he was arraigned in Brooklyn Criminal Court on four counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, one count of assault, two counts of robbery and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon, Brooklyn district attorney's office spokesman Jonah Bruno said. On Monday, Joe Lozito told HLN's Vinne Politan that he felt ""every kind of emotion -- scared to death, you're angry"" -- when Gelman allegedly lunged at him with a knife Sunday morning about a Manhattan subway train. Lozito is out of the hospital, where he earlier had been in stable condition being treated for cuts to his head and neck. The Philadelphia resident, who works in New York, said he anticipated confronting Gelman once again in court. ""I have the scars on my head and I have the memories I probably won't be able to rid myself of, and I want this guy to go away for a long time,"" Lozito said. As he was led away from Brooklyn's 61st precinct to an awaiting police cruiser Sunday, Gelman was deluged with questions from gathered media and hostile shouts from the crowd. After uttering an expletive, he said, ""This was a set-up, man."" Authorities alleged Saturday that Gelman fatally stabbed three people, hit and killed a man with a car, slashed at least five other people and carjacked two vehicles before he was wrestled to the ground early Saturday after trying to break into the cab of a subway train. Friedman said Gelman's case will head to a grand jury Friday. Gelman, 23, who is unemployed and known to authorities mostly as a graffiti artist, was arrested about 9 a.m. Saturday, about 28 hours after he is alleged to have begun the spree spanning three New York boroughs, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Saturday. ""It's so horrendous and bizarre,"" Kelly told reporters Saturday. ""We have no reason that we can give you as to why he did this."" Police believe Gelman got into a dispute with his mother at her Brooklyn home about 5 a.m. Friday after she refused to let him take her 2004 Lexus. The suspect's stepfather, Aleksandr Kuznetsov, intervened and was stabbed 11 times, they said. Kuznetsov, 54, died, while Gelman's mother -- who survived unscathed -- alerted authorities. Investigators believe Gelman then took the Lexus, drove about a mile away to the home of his ex-girlfriend and stabbed her mother, 56-year-old Anna Bulchenko, 11 times, at about 10:30 a.m. Gelman's former girlfriend found her mother dead on the floor when she returned home at about 4:15 p.m., police said. She called police. But in the short period before they arrived, authorities believe Gelman -- who presumably was still in the apartment -- allegedly attacked the former girlfriend, Yelena Bulchenko, 20, with a knife. He chased her into the street and killed her, also slashing the jacket sleeve of a passerby trying to stop him, authorities said. He then left the scene in the Lexus and rear-ended another car, a Pontiac Bonneville, allegedly stabbing its 60-year-old driver three times in the shoulder and neck in a confrontation and then leaving the scene in that car, police said. Authorities said they later found four kitchen knives in the Lexus. About 4:25 p.m., the car allegedly struck a pedestrian about two miles away, Kelly said. Steve Tannenbaum, 60, died of his injuries. Police believe the suspect eventually abandoned the Pontiac, which was later found near a Brooklyn railroad line he was known to frequent as a graffiti artist. Shortly before 1 a.m. Saturday, Gelman allegedly got into a cab in Brooklyn and stabbed the driver. As of Saturday, that driver was in stable condition. Kelly said Gelman then got out of the car and confronted a couple, allegedly stabbing a man in the hands and taking his car keys. That man was treated and released at a hospital, Kelly said. The car, a Nissan, was later found in Queens. Shelton Pottinger told reporters he was that victim. ""He looked crazy,"" he said of the man who stabbed him. ""He looked like a crazy guy."" He said the man pulled a knife and a gun and told him to get out of the car or he would kill him. ""I was shocked,"" he said. ""I didn't know what to do."" But he said he decided to fight, and moved over into the passenger seat. ""I was trying to kick him to get him out."" But he said the man forced his way in and hit the gas. Pottinger said he was holding on to the man's hands as he tried to stab him. Police received a tip Saturday morning that the suspect might have been riding a southbound subway train in Manhattan. A woman approached police at a subway stop and said Gelman knocked a newspaper featuring his picture from her hands and said to her, ""Do you believe what they're writing about me?"" before crossing the tracks and jumping onto a train. The man stabbed a seated passenger -- 40-year-old Lozito, who said he didn't know the suspect or about the alleged stabbing spree until he landed in the hospital -- during his time onboard. Gelman allegedly told Lozito, ""You're going to die"" before attacking him with the knife from above. ""At that moment, I'm not thinking much of anything besides survive,"" recalled Lozito, who said he tried to tackle the suspect after he was slashed in the head. Eventually, the man worked his way to the front cab of the train. The commissioner said the suspect pounded on the cab's door, yelling ""Police"" -- apparently trying to get in by claiming he was a police officer. He did not appear to know two transit police officers, later identified as Terrance Howell and Tamara Taylor, were inside the cab with the train's operator. Soon after, the officers -- with aid from off-duty New York police Detective Marcelo Razzo and an unnamed civilian nearby -- wrestled Gelman to the ground, police said. No one was hurt in that scuffle, during which a knife fell to the ground. Police also found Gelman had another, smaller, knife when they detained him. He also had what Kelly described as a ""significant amount of money."" Kelly said the suspect was mostly ""incoherent"" after being arrested, making a statement that ""she had to die."" The commissioner said he did not know who ""she"" referred to. Kelly said Gelman had 10 previous arrests, mostly for drug charges and graffiti, plus one robbery charge. His most recent arrest was January 26, when he was accused of possessing crack cocaine. For roughly the past seven years, Gelman has been a naturalized U.S. citizen. He arrived in this country with his father and mother in 1992 from his native Ukraine.

"(CNN) -- The roommate of the Rutgers University freshman who killed himself after his sexual encounter with another man was broadcast online was indicted Wednesday on privacy and bias charges, the prosecutor of Middlesex County in New Jersey announced. A grand jury indicted Dharun Ravi, 19, on 15 counts including invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with physical evidence, witness tampering, and hindering apprehension or prosecution. Ravi's attorney could not be immediately reached for comment. The indictment alleged that Ravi secretly viewed and streamed online the encounter between his roommate, Tyler Clementi, and another man in September of last year. Authorities said Ravi allegedly secretly placed a camera in the room and accessed it remotely. Ravi ""then provided others an opportunity to view the encounter,"" Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce J. Kaplan said in a statement. Two days later, Ravi attempted to view a second encounter between Clementi and the same male, alerting others on Twitter of the planned meeting, the statement said. Ravi is accused of then deleting the tweet and replacing it with a false tweet in order to mislead the investigation, according to the statement. Clementi's body was recovered from the Hudson River on September 30, more than a week after he jumped from the George Washington Bridge, which spans the Hudson River separating New York from New Jersey. He was 18. Molly Wei, 19, was also charged with two counts of invasion of privacy in relation to the case, prosecutors said. ""The grand jury indictment spells out cold and calculated acts against our son Tyler by his former college roommate,"" Clementi's family said in a statement Wednesday. ""We are eager to have the process move forward for justice in this case and to reinforce the standards of acceptable conduct in our society."" The case exposed the issue of bullying on school campuses and has fed anti-bullying efforts across the nation. In October, less than a month after Clementi's suicide, President Barack Obama released a taped video message condemning such acts. ""You are not alone,"" the president says. ""You did not do anything wrong. ""You didn't do anything to deserve being bullied and there is a whole world waiting for you filled with possibilities,"" Obama adds. In November, Clementi's family consented to the use of his name on federal anti-harassment legislation called the ""Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act."" The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid ""to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student,"" said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey.","Dharun Ravi was indicted Wednesday on privacy and bias charges .

"(CNN) -- American teenager Sloane Stephens stunned her compatriot Serena Williams on Wednesday, beating the 15-time grand slam winner 3-6 7-5 6-4 to reach the Australian Open semifinals. The 29th seed, playing in her first grand slam quarterfinal, came from once set down to overcome third seed Williams who suffered a back injury having already rolled an ankle earlier in the tournament. Despite Williams' fitness problems, few had given Stephens a chance of beating the five-time Melbourne champion. ""Someone asked me, 'Do you think you can win?' I was like, 'Yeah, I think so, but I wasn't like too clear about it,''"" the 19-year-old told reporters after advancing to a tie with world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka on Thursday. ""Then this morning when I got up, I was like, 'Look, dude, like, you can do this, go out and play and do your best.'"" Stephens did not make the best possible start as Williams went one set and a break of serve ahead, before the 19-year-old American dug deep to pull out an unlikely triumph. ""You just fight and just get every ball back, run every ball down, and just get a lot of balls in play,"" said Stephens, explaining her strategy after the loss of that first set. ""From then on I got aggressive, started coming to the net more, and just got a lot more comfortable."" Stephens becomes the first U.S. teenager to reach a grand slam semfinal since Serena at the 2001 U.S. Open, and the first to achieve the feat outside of the Williams sisters since Alexandra Stevenson at Wimbledon in 1999. For Williams, it marked the end of a campaign which had pushed her body to the limit. ""I'm almost relieved that it's over because there's only so much I felt I could do,"" said the 31-year-old. ""It's been a little difficult. I've been thrown a lot of balls these two weeks."" When one journalist asked Williams if she had considered retiring hurt during the match, it caused some confusion in the press room. ""Are you kidding me? I'm not retiring,"" responded Williams, believing the reporter was asking if she was considering ending her career. ""Oh, you mean, retiring in the match! Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you meant my career. You're crazy. ""I thought about it like for a nanosecond. It's a quarterfinal of a grand slam. Even if I have to take off in a wheeler before I retire."" Defending champion Azarenka had to battle through a tough 77-minute first set against Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, before winning 7-5 6-1. When asked about Stephens prior to her victory against Williams, Belarus' Azarenka said: ""I think Sloane is a very, very talented girl. I think over the last couple years you see her development, you know, as a tennis player. ""Her game has come together. She's an all round player, very competitive. I think she has a good potential. It's just a matter of her getting all those details in place and really wanting to achieve great things."" The second semifinal, also due to take place on Thursday, sees sixth seed Li Na take on No. 2 seed Maria Sharapova -- who is yet to drop at set at the tournament.","Sloane Stephens beats compatriot Serena Williams to reach Australian Open semis .

"Washington (CNN) -- Turkey, stuffing and pumpkin pie, along with a visit by the commanding general in Iraq and a phone call from President Obama, were some of the ways the White House and Pentagon helped U.S. troops overseas celebrate Thanksgiving. Obama called 10 troops -- two each from the five branches of the military -- based in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Arabian Sea to thank them for their service and wish them a happy Thanksgiving, the White House said. In Iraq, Gen. Raymond Odierno, the top U.S. military commander there, toured several bases and joint security stations to personally tell U.S. troops how much they're appreciated and also wish them a happy Thanksgiving. At Joint Security Station Nasr Al Salam, west of Baghdad, Odierno spoke to CNN while soldiers played a game of flag football in the muddy field behind him. ""I go around all the time, but on Thanksgiving I spend more time actually shaking hands and saying hello to everybody because I want to thank them for their service,"" Odierno said. ""I tell them this is our family when you can't be with your family."" The Pentagon's Defense Logistics Agency made plans to ship Thanksgiving meals to roughly 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan this year, according to Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell. In order to accommodate military personnel working different shifts, the meals were to be served around the clock at many of the larger military dining facilities in both countries, Morrell said. Providing Thanksgiving feasts required huge quantities of food, including 63,000 pounds of potatoes, 8,700 cans of cranberry sauce, 61,000 pounds of stuffing and more than 465,000 pounds of turkey, Morrell said. For dessert, there will be 67,000 pies and cakes. Morrell said the men and women of the armed forces deserve America's thanks. ""With this, we send to our troops a small reminder of our immeasurable gratitude for all they do to serve our country. We also, of course, convey our hopes for their safe return home,"" he said. In Iraq, about 115,000 American troops remain, with plans to withdraw more than half of them by the end of August. There are 68,000 U.S. troops committed to Afghanistan, and Obama is expected to announce next week the deployment of additional troops to the country. In the United States, dozens of active duty sailors celebrated the holiday at the first Thanksgiving ""Supper for Sailors"" hosted by the U.S. Navy Memorial in Washington. After an opening blessing by a Navy chaplain, the sailors tucked into a traditional meal of turkey, stuffing and green beans while television screens in the background broadcast football games.

"(CNN) -- From the Epic of Gilgamesh, composed in Mesopotamia 4,000 years ago, to Evan Almighty -- Hollywood's 2007 take on the Noah's Ark story -- floods and their catastrophic effects have long provided inspiration for storytellers. As global warming provokes increasingly severe weather events, however, the gap between art and life is fast narrowing, with apocalyptic flooding scenarios now as common in reality as in the imaginations of Hollywood scriptwriters. Recent flooding in the UK, for example -- the worst for 60 years -- left some 30,000 people homeless and the insurance industry facing over £3 billion ($6 billion) in payouts. Torrential rains in India, Nepal and Bangladesh have caused even greater misery, claiming hundreds of lives and displacing an estimated 20 million civilians. In the U.S., meanwhile, New Orleans continues to suffer from the ravages of 2005's Hurricaine Katrina, with much of the city still empty and uninhabitable two years after the deluge. With low-lying areas around the world increasingly susceptible to flooding -- this at a time when population growth has necessitated the construction of more and more homes in such areas -- the question of how to balance the need for housing with the dangers of rising water levels has never been more pressing. In the Netherlands, where half the country lies below mean sea level and flooding has long been a fact of life, construction and engineering company Dura Vermeer has come up with a novel and, when you think about it, obvious solution to the problem: houses that float. ""These type of homes offer a good way of dealing with the effects of climate change,"" Dura Vermeer spokesman Johan van der Pol told CNN. ""Unlike normal houses, they are extremely flexible when it comes to flooding, able to deal with a sea level rise of up to five metres. ""In a country such as Holland, where flooding is a serious problem, this sort of technology could have an extremely important role to play."" The company has developed two variations on the same theme: a floating house which, as the name suggests, sits permanently on the water like a boat; and an amphibious house that stands on dry land but, in the event of floods, is able to rise with the water. Both employ a large hollow concrete cube at their base to provide buoyancy, and are ""moored"" in pairs to huge steel piles to keep them anchored in one place, the piles enabling them to withstand currents as strong as you would find on the open seas. Water and electricity are brought in through flexible pipes that have been adapted to bend and move with the swell of the water. In every other respect they look and feel like normal homes -- albeit up-market designer homes -- with split-level accommodation, wooden balconies and clapboard exteriors painted cheery shades of yellow, green and blue. ""The steel piles mean that residents experience no horizontal, side-to-side movement,"" explains van der Pol. ""Although there is a small amount of vertical, up and down movement, most residents say they find the feeling quite enjoyable. ""These houses not only offer protection against floods, but also great quality of living and low environmental impact."" So far Dura Vermeer has built 46 such water-friendly units - 14 floating and 32 amphibious - at Maasbommel, on the banks of the River Maas in Gelderland province in the centre of the country. The technology and design -- the latter provided by Dutch architectural firm Factor Architecten -- took three years to develop, although obtaining a government green light for the project took considerably longer. ""After the disastrous floods of 1995 the Dutch government laid down strict rules forbidding the building of houses beside rivers. ""We had a lot of discussion with them and eventually those rules were adapted to allow for the construction of suitable housing at fifteen separate river locations, of which Maasbommel is one. ""Our philosophy is that you can look at water as a threat, but also as a challenge and a commercial opportunity. Combining water and housing is the obvious way forward in countries such as the Netherlands."" Floating buildings are certainly not the only way of achieving such a combination. Dura Vermeer is also developing what they term ""dry-proof"" and ""wet-proof"" houses, the former designed to prevent water intrusion, the latter to actually allow it. ""The idea with wet-proof houses is that all the essential rooms -- living room, kitchen, bedroom - are on the upper floors,"" explains van der Pol. ""In the event of a flood you open the doors and allow the water to enter the non-essential lower rooms, which have been specially designed to resist water damage, with waterproof plaster and specially adapted electrics and plumbing. ""It is how houses in Holland always used to be built."" If there are a number of technological options, however, it is the idea of a floating house, one that can withstand rising water levels by literally rising with them, that has attracted the most interest, both within the Netherlands and from countries with similar flooding issues. ""There have been enquiries from around the world,"" says van der Pol. ""We are now working with companies in the Far East, Asia, America and elsewhere in Europe, although we ourselves will only be building houses in Holland."" The houses are certainly not being touted as an alternative to conventional flood defenses such as dykes, levees and river barriers. Nor are they cheap, their starting price of 260,000 euros ($310,000) meaning that, in terms of mass construction, it is only the world's more affluent nations that will be able to afford them (although as van der Pol points out, developing countries such as Bangladesh tend to use materials other than concrete to build houses, so probably would have much use for these type of structures anyway.) In Europe, the U.S, and Canada, on the other hand, such buildings could well become the norm, with Dura Vermeer and a number of other Dutch companies already exploring the possibility of entire cities built in this manner. With scientists predicting sea-level rises of up to 110 cms (43 inches) by 2100, and catastrophic weather events becoming ever more common, the floating house could be the only realistic way for people to continue living in low-lying areas without fear of losing their homes, possessions and even lives to flooding. As Dutch Housing Minister Sybilla Dekker recently put it: ""You cannot fight water. You have to learn how to live with it."" Or in this case, float on it. ............................................. Are floating houses the answer to rising sea levels? Would you live in a floating home?

"(EW.com) -- Jessica Chastain is having a moment. Not only did the red-headed Oscar nominee win a Golden Globe last weekend for her work in ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" which forced her to take a night off from her Broadway run â€” yes she's starring in Broadway's ""The Heiress"" during the thick of awards season â€” but she's now achieved something few actors have ever managed: she currently holds the number one and number two movies at the box office. Chastain's latest vehicle, ""Mama,"" crushed the competition over the three-day weekend with a whopping $28.1 million. Universal, who produced the PG-13 film for only $15 million, opened ""Mama"" in 2,647 theaters, where it earned a terrific $10,624 average. The horror title played very well with young women â€” 61 percent of viewers were female, and 63 percent were below the age of 25. Unfortunately, most of those audiences weren't overly enthusiastic about what they saw, issuing ""Mama"" a lackluster ""B-"" CinemaScore grade. Chastain's other entry, ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" fell only 28 percent in its sophomore weekend of wide release to $17.6 million, which brought the Osama Bin Laden huntdown's total to $55.9 million. Controversy continues to boost the Kathryn Bigelow-directed drama's profile, but great word-of-mouth seems to be playing just as big of a role in ""Zero Dark Thirty's"" success. 'Norbit' Effect: 9 Oscar killers? It's fair to say that Chastain's presence in both ""Mama"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"" had little to do with each film's successful box office performance. Neither was marketed on her appeal, and yet, that doesn't take away from her achievement. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" performed very nicely in its nationwide expansion. Upon jumping from 810 to 2,523 theaters, ""Playbook"" increased 126 percent to $11.4 million, which brings its total to $55.3 million so far. (Kudos to the Weinstein Co. for its deftly executed platform strategy. If they had opened ""Silver Linings Playbook"" in wide release, as planned, we almost certainly wouldn't be talking about it 10 weeks later.) In the month leading up to Oscar season, good word-of-mouth may continue to carry ""Silver Linings Playbook"" to a total as high as $100 million. 'Mythbusters' vs. zombies: Can you help? In fourth place, Warner Bros.' crime drama ""Gangster Squad"" fell 47 percent to $9.1 million, giving the $60 million Sean Penn/Josh Brolin action flick an unremarkable $32.2 million total after ten days. Still, ""Gangster Squad's"" second weekend was better than the debuts of new releases ""Broken City"" and ""The Last Stand,"" which both flopped out of the gate. Fox's $35 million ""Broken City,"" which stars the usually reliable Mark Wahlberg alongside Russell Crowe, drew only $9.0 million worth of tickets from 2,620 theaters, while Lionsgate's $45 million ""The Last Stand,"" an Arnold Schwarznegger film, fared even worse with a puny $6.3 million. Both films played primarily to older male audiences (who are also seeing ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Gangster Squad""), and they may have cannibalized each other over their first three days. 1.

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Jordanians completed voting Wednesday in a landmark election that one outside observer said was free of any violations, the state-run news agency Petra said. As their country undergoes political strains and electoral reforms, about 1.3 million Jordanians went to the polls, representing 56.6% of registered voters, said Independent Elections Commission spokesman Hussein Bani Hani. David Martin, head of the European Union's Election Observation Mission in Jordan, praised measures taken by a newly created commission in managing the elections and said there were no violations. The mission will hold a press conference Friday morning. Official results will be announced by noon Thursday, Hani said, according to Petra. In the 17th time Jordan has gone to the polls to elect a parliament since becoming a nation in 1946, Wednesday's balloting was an election of firsts. For the first time, the country has allowed observers. It was the first time that an independent election commission oversaw polling. ""These elections today are the culmination of a constitutional process, the beginning of a new phase of reforms. It is a continuing process,"" said Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour said he had not yet submitted his resignation to King Abdullah II until elections are completed, Petra reported. Jordanians who are part of the Muslim Brotherhood were said to be boycotting the election -- an action Ensour described as not democratic, Petra said. Voting is a duty, he said. If voter turnout is deemed weak, Ensour said, it will be mainly due to people's frustrations with the performance of former parliaments and the suspicion that surrounded previous polls. Still, Jordan could be a model for the Arab world in holding free and fair elections, Ensour said. ""Fair elections cannot only be ensured by the government and its agencies but also by candidates, voters and civil society institutions,"" Ensour said, adding that the government and the Independent Elections Commission did their utmost to fight any electoral corruption. The king has stated in discussion papers that the new prime minister will be designated based on consultations with the parliamentary bloc that has the majority, Ensour said. The deliberate steps at transparency are crucial for a country that's under a great deal of political strain -- and whose stability has ramifications for the world outside its borders. Recent events have threatened the fragile monarchy to the point that some analysts are warning of collapse. What began with protests by the Islamic Action Front, Jordan's branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, has given way to broader unrest led by tribal factions known as al-Hirak (the movement). Al-Hirak demands an end to corruption and calls for a new era of political reform in Jordan in which Islamists are almost sure to dominate. In an effort to quell the protests, Jordan's ruler, King Abdullah II, dissolved parliament last year and amended election laws. In a region rocked by Arab Spring upheavals, Jordan has been relatively stable and is one of the few friends Israel has. It is amid this backdrop that most Jordanians went to the polls. Opposition groups boycotted it. ""Elections have been fairly smooth so far,"" said David Martin, chief observer of the European Union Election Observing Mission. Some polling stations reported minor technical glitches, but there had been no ""signs of intimidation,"" he said. Security and observers . Wednesday's balloting took place under the watchful eye of 47,000 police officers and another 7,000 election observers. ""Opening the door to observers -- international, Arab and local -- is proof that we trust ourselves and that there's nothing to hide,"" said Samih Maaytah, a government spokesman. ""The Jordanian Parliamentary Elections are under the scrutiny of the entire world. And we're in the time of the Arab Spring and nobody's afraid to say anything."" Judeh, speaking Wednesday to CNN, said his country had ""anticipated the Arab Spring,"" so the king began reforms ""many years ago."" But he acknowledged that protests in the region expedited the changes inside Jordan. More than 3 million Jordanians were eligible to vote for candidates to the new 150-member House of Deputies, officials said. A field of more than 1,400 candidates vied for the seats. ""Nothing undermines the legitimacy of any election except the lack of participation by the electorate, by the people who are eligible to vote,"" Judeh said. Muslim Brotherhood opts out . The reforms made by the Jordanian government were not enough to satisfy the Muslim Brotherhood, which felt the new electoral laws favored the monarchy. Despite their rejection, the government continued to encourage them to take part in the process. ""We told the Brotherhood members who are boycotting that we invite you to exercise the same logic that your brothers in Egypt with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood exercised when there was a dispute over the constitution and not the law,"" Maaytah said. ""They invited Egyptians to the ballot box. So we invite you to the ballot box here."" In a discussion paper posted on Jordan's U.S. Embassy website, Abdullah said the country is transitioning to a parliamentary government and has ""enhanced the separation of powers, the checks and balances of our governance system, the independence of our judiciary and the inalienable rights of our citizens."" Jordan has amended one-third of the constitution and established a constitutional court, the king said. ""These actions empower the Jordanian people to shape the country's future in a way that is more transparent, fair and inclusive than ever before,"" Abdullah wrote. ""Crafting a modern democratic society will be the product of our learning and developing together over time, not a single moment or set of reforms."" Time for a change . The United States has said it supports both the king's road map for reform -- which gradually shifts more power to the elected parliament -- and demands for a more inclusive political process. But the two may not be compatible. The tribes don't want to see the largely urban Muslim Brotherhood -- which derives much of its support from Jordan's Palestinian population, which makes up about half the country -- gain power at their expense. Pinched by an economic crisis that has left the government virtually bankrupt and unrest in neighboring countries, Abdullah faces a challenge that may not be satisfied by all the firsts represented in this election.

"Marjah, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The NATO operation aimed at tackling a Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan is making progress, officials say. Operation Moshtarak, in the southern city of Marjah, is going ""very smooth"" so far, U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Col. Mark Dietz told CNN Monday. He said the Marines had bypassed several lines of roadside bombs and were in the process of clearing the city ""from the inside out."" There has been some active combat, said CNN's Atia Abawi, who is embedded with U.S. Marines in Marjah. Watch Marines in action in Marjah . The Taliban is ""popping up in various parts of the city,"" Abawi said. ""We went just a couple hundred meters outside of the position that we're usually based in -- we were under gunfire ourselves."" Marjah is ""practically a ghost town right now,"" she added. ""You can't really find out where they're hiding. ... They can be anywhere."" Abawi said NATO forces are hoping to draw more ""extremist fighters"" out of their hiding places and into combat. Between two and three insurgents are being killed in each clash on average, she said, and NATO commanders ""don't expect [fighting] to die down anytime soon."" Combined forces have been ""conducting a number of mounted and dismounted patrols,"" according to a news release from the International Security Assistance Force. ""Elements of the combined force have been engaged in periodic small arms fire fights, and a number of insurgents have been either killed or detained,"" ISAF said. The release noted that the combined force ""has sustained some injuries."" Troops recovered $8.7 million worth of raw opium, Abawi reported. Clearing out poppy fields is a key part of Operation Moshtarak, the biggest offensive since the Afghan war started in 2001. The Taliban finances its activities in part through the illegal opium trade. The operation in Helmand province focuses on Marjah and surrounding areas. Marjah, known as the country's heroin capital, is where the Taliban set up a shadow government. The city is now the ""last bastion"" for the Taliban in the Helmand River valley, Dietz said. One of the biggest challenges facing the NATO mission is attacking the Taliban while limiting civilian casualties. On Sunday, 12 civilians died in a rocket attack by coalition troops. ISAF first issued a statement saying the civilians were killed when a rocket hit about 600 meters (650 yards) from its intended target. A senior ISAF official, however, later said the rocket was not off target at all. The official said troops hit the building they were aiming for but did not know that civilians were inside. The official has direct knowledge of the incident, but he declined to be named because an investigation is under way. ""It's regrettable that in the course of our joint efforts, innocent lives were lost,"" U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, top commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement Sunday. McChrystal has given troops clear orders to avoid civilian casualties. ""Even if there is a Taliban fighter within a compound and [troops] suspect that a civilian is in there, they are not allowed to fire,"" Abawi reported. A group of Afghan villagers came to the Marines with two wounded teenage boys. The military treated them and sent them by medevac to the nearest hospital. Villagers told the troops that the Taliban were using private homes to fire at U.S. forces. In an incident not connected to Operation Moshtarak, an airstrike by NATO forces accidentally killed five Afghan civilians and wounded two Monday in Afghanistan, the military said. A joint Afghan-ISAF patrol in Kandahar province observed a group of people who seemed to be burying an improvised explosive device, ISAF said.  The patrol called in an airstrike, but later found out that the group was not planting an IED. ""We regret this tragic accident and offer our sympathies to the families of those killed and injured,"" Maj. Gen. Michael Regner, ISAF Joint Command deputy chief of staff, said in the ISAF statement. About 15,000 Afghan and NATO forces are taking part in Operation Moshtarak. U.S. troops are leading the mission. ""The majority of the fighting, the majority of the headway being made, is by the U.S. forces,"" Abawi reported. She added that she had seen many Afghan soldiers ""and to be quite honest with you, they're not ready to fight."" More on Operation Moshtarak from Afghanistan Crossroads blog . In a statement Monday, Master Sgt. Jeff Loftin, a spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, said forces were in the ""clearing phase."" Afghan and NATO troops discovered 5,500 pounds of explosives and seized a Taliban commander responsible for small arms ambushes and roadside attacks on troops, Loftin said. Forces were facing primarily small arms fire, he said. Several insurgents have been killed or detained and some coalition troop members have suffered injuries. Loftin did not specify the number of militants and troops wounded or killed. Over the weekend, provincial spokesman Dawoud Ahmadi said 27 Taliban fighters were killed. A Taliban spokesman for the Marjah area disputed the numbers, and said there had been six Taliban casualties while militants had killed 192 troops. The Taliban has often inflated casualty figures in the past.

"(CNN) -- While the world's attention has been focused on tumult in the Arab world, Iran has cracked down with impunity on dissent and is feared to come down even harder as elections approach, Amnesty International said in a sweeping report. The global human rights monitor documented ""widespread and persistent human rights violations in Iran."" ""It is essential if further mass human rights violations are to be avoided that the international community act on behalf of the hundreds, if not thousands, of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners imprisoned after unfair trials in Iran,"" Amnesty International said in the report. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini celebrated the popular revolts in Tunisia, Egypt and Bahrain, saying that they reflected an ""Islamic awakening"" based on Iran's 1979 revolution. But since the 2009 election, the Islamic republic has repressed similar voices within its own borders, Amnesty International said. ""Since the 2009 crackdown, the authorities have steadily cranked up repression in law and practice, and tightened their grip on the media,"" according to the Amnesty International report, which came out just hours after the United Nations Human Rights Council convened for its latest session in Geneva. ""In Iran today, you put yourself at risk if you do anything that might fall outside the increasingly narrow confines of what the authorities deem socially or politically acceptable,"" said Ann Harrison, of Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa program. ""Anything from setting up a social group on the Internet, forming or joining an NGO or expressing your opposition to the status quo can land you in prison,"" she said. Iran has defended its record before the United Nations Human Rights Council and charged that Western critics are politicizing the issue of human rights for their own gain. Yet Amnesty International said Iran has deemed demonstrations, public debate and the formation of groups and associations a threat to ""national security"" punishable by long prison sentences or even death. ""Lawyers have been jailed along with their clients. Foreign satellite television channels have been jammed. Newspapers have been banned,"" the advocacy group said. Mahdieh Mohammadi Gorgani, wife of detained journalist Ahmad Zeidabadi, describes in the report how an interrogator told her husband, ""We are ordered to crush you. And if you do not cooperate, we can do anything we want with you. And if you do not write the interrogation papers, we will force you to eat them."" Amnesty International said blogger Mehdi Khazali was this month sentenced to four and a half years in prison followed by 10 years in ""internal exile,"" plus sentenced to pay a fine on charges believed to include ""spreading propaganda against the system,"" ""gathering and colluding against national security"" and ""insulting officials."" Amnesty International called on the world to pressure Iran to amend laws that restrict rights of expression and assembly, as well as to allow for public debate before Iranians cast their votes in March. It also called for an end to jail time for people who protest peacefully and independent investigations of alleged human rights violations. The issue of human rights, said Amnesty International, can get lost as the international community scrutinizes Iran's nuclear program. ""For Iranians facing this level of repression, it can be dispiriting that discussions about their country in diplomatic circles can seem to focus mainly on the nuclear program at the expense of human rights,"" Harrison said.","A new Amnesty International report documents what is described as repression in Iran .

"(CNN) -- A man pleaded guilty Monday to killing a Virginia Tech graduate student at a restaurant in January, attacking her with a knife and decapitating her, according to officials. Haiyang Zhu, 26, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in connection with the death of Xin Yang, a graduate student studying accounting at Virginia Tech, officials said. Xin, 22, from Beijing, China, had begun her studies at Virginia Tech only two weeks before she was killed at the Au Bon Pain restaurant in the university's Graduate Life Center on January 21, school officials said. School spokesman Larry Hincker told CNN in January the two were believed to have known each other, based on emergency contact records maintained by the university, but witnesses saw no sign of an argument before Xin was attacked. Haiyang, a native of Ningbo, China, was taken into custody at the scene. He had written a love letter to Xin, but she told him she was engaged to another man, Montgomery County commonwealth's attorney Bradley Finch told CNN. Haiyang purchased the knife used to kill Xin the morning of her death and attempted to call her 12 times, with the first call coming just after he bought the knife, Finch said. ""He completely severed her head,"" Finch said. Xin also had severe knife wounds to her hands and arms, he said. In a writing titled ""Will,"" Haiyang said he had expressed love for Xin and that she broke his heart when she said she was engaged to someone else, Finch said. Haiyang said the rejection was too cruel and that Xin's fiance could not compare to him in education and background, and she should have seen he would be the best husband for her. Haiyang was a graduate student pursuing a doctorate in agricultural and applied economics. Hincker said he began studying at Virginia Tech in the fall of 2008. Haiyang is scheduled to be sentenced in April, according to court records. Xin's slaying was the first on the Virginia Tech campus since April 16, 2007, when Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 students and professors before turning a gun on himself. CNN's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.","Haiyang Zhu pleads guilty to first-degree murder in the death of Xin Yang .

"(CNN) -- Featuring more than five Oscar-nominated actors, ""New Year's Eve"" boasts a star-studded cast. But what happens when there seems to be more people on screen than there are in theaters? Opening with a meager $13.7 million, ""New Year's Eve"" could cause studios to rethink the holiday-ensemble formula that worked so well for ""Valentine's Day"" in 2010. In other words, don't expect to see ""Labor Day"" in theaters anytime soon, Variety managing editor Stuart Levine joked. But the idea of ""marquee loading,"" as casting director David Rubin calls it, probably isn't to blame for ""New Year's Eve's"" box office face plant. ""Marquee names represent somewhat of an insurance policy for the film's investors,"" said Rubin, who has cast ensemble films like ""Hairspray"" and ""Romeo + Juliet."" ""No ensemble cast is successful past opening weekend unless the actors are well-chosen for their characters."" The focus of the film needs to be on storytelling, added Rubin, noting he hasn't seen ""New Year's Eve."" ""If casting large stars distracts from the telling of the story, it's a bad idea."" Ramin Setoodeh, a senior writer at Newsweek and The Daily Beast, agreed. It seemed like actors were cast for celebrity rather than parts, he said. Some parts were just lazy, Setoodeh said, referencing the connection between Zac Efron and Sarah Jessica Parker's characters. The pair played siblings in the film, despite their significant age difference. Appealing to different demographics with casting -- such as the way ""New Year's Eve"" featured Robert De Niro in addition to ""Glee's"" Lea Michele -- is a common strategy, Rubin said. But hitting different audiences should be a bonus, not a focus. ""It would be disingenuous of me to say we didn't have an eye toward hitting certain demographics of audiences (when casting 'Hairspray'),"" he said. ""But if we made choices purely based on demographics, without regard to storytelling, we'd have a less successful film."" ""If it's only a gimmick, its success is short lived,"" Rubin said, adding, that if it's done with thought, it's a marketing bonus. The short stories might also have had a hand in ""New Year's Eve"" finishing its opening weekend more than $35 million short of its budget. ""Because of the division of screen time, you may end up giving none of (the actors) enough of a chance to register in their stories,"" Rubin said. Since the film's release, media outlets have dwelled on ""New Year's Eve's"" unrealistic plot points, from Ashton Kutcher's character sneaking into a secured space in Times Square to Katherine Heigl as a big-time caterer with poor knife skills. ""Valentine's Day"" might not have garnered critical acclaim, but it was at least likeable and charming, Setoodeh said. The romantic comedy, which hit theaters in February, raked in $56 million its opening weekend. But to be fair, ""Valentine's Day"" opened the weekend of February 14, a day when couples and singles alike flock to the movie theater. ""It's hard to get people excited about a movie about New Year's,"" Setoodeh said. However, other ensemble romantic comedies that didn't open on a holiday weekend, like 2003's ""Love Actually"" and 2009's ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" were still able to benefit from ensemble casts. It will be interesting to see how ""What to Expect When You're Expecting,"" another flick with an all-star roster, performs when it hits theaters in May. Disappointing numbers aside, ""New Year's Eve"" did manage to edge out its competition. Jonah Hill's ""The Sitter"" finished the weekend with a mere $10 million. Still, winning at the box office doesn't carry as much weight when a weekend only garners $73.2 million domestically, the worst total of 2011, Entertainment Weekly noted. Before the box office numbers rolled in, Funny or Die put out a trailer for ""Christmas Day,"" a parody of ensemble films like ""New Year's Eve."" Slides reading, ""76 characters ... 41 plotlines ... trying to find love"" flash between clips from various romantic comedies -- like ""Serendipity"" and ""Love Happens."" The trailer closes with the tagline, ""Small plots. Big celebrities."" It's not enough to feature a bunch of celebrities on a movie poster, Levine said. The story has to be good for a movie to do well in the long term.","""New Year's Eve"" opens with a meager $13.7 million .

"(CNN) -- Insurgents locked in a standoff with U.S. Marines tricked them by dressing up as women to escape, a task force spokesman said Monday. U.S. Marines scan the site of a blast that hit a U.S. vehicle in southern Afghanistan. Women and children had been caught in the standoff between the armed groups, but some of the women were not what they seemed, according to task force spokesman Capt. William Pelletier. After the Marines began taking fire from insurgents in the town of Khan Neshin, in south Afghanistan near the Helmand River, the militants ran into a multiple-room compound, the U.S. military said. Unsure of whether civilians were inside the compound, the Marines had an interpreter talk to the insurgents, said an official who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. After some time, a number of women and children left the compound, the military official said. The released hostages told the Marines that there were no more civilians inside the compound, Pelletier said. But the Marines held their fire anyway, the official said. About 4 p.m. (7:30 a.m. ET), in the midst of the standoff, another group of women and children emerged from the compound, the official said. The Marines continued to hold their fire and wait out the insurgents, the official said. Finally, a screaming woman emerged from the compound with a bullet wound to her hand, Pelletier said. Then, another group of women came out, covered from head to toe according to custom, he said, with a couple of children in tow. The Marines attended to the wounded woman while the others walked away. When the Marines went into the compound, they discovered that it empty, Pelletier said. That's when they realized the fighters had dressed up as women to escape, he said. ""Apparently these were tall, rather broad-shouldered women with hairy feet,"" Pelletier said. The Marines' restrained approach differs from previous hits on compounds when airstrikes were readily called in, the official said. Under a new tactical directive for forces in Afghanistan, some of which was unclassified Monday, forces must protect civilians soldiers and must be sensitive to Afghan cultural norms regarding women. Pelletier said that during the standoff, ""the Marines didn't have any female forces to do any searches, and they weren't going to violate cultural norms by patting down these women."" The standoff in the town of Khan Neshin was especially significant because it has been a Taliban stronghold for several years, and the U.S. military reported that the Afghan government regained control of the town Monday. Coalition forces began talks with local leaders several days ago and have moved about 500 Marines into Khan Neshin, a U.S. military news release said. The government takeover of Khan Neshin marks the first time coalition forces have had a sustained presence so far south in the Helmand River valley, the release said. The mission to secure Khan Neshin coincides with ""establishing secure conditions"" for August elections in Afghanistan, according to the release. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, a six U.S. soldiers were killed Monday by two roadside bombs, a representative for NATO forces said. Four were killed in Kunduz province in northern Afghanistan, the U.S. military said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Two soldiers were killed in southern Afghanistan, NATO's International Security Assistance Forces said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Stars and Stripes, the newspaper that receives U.S. military funding to help it cover and get distributed free to American forces in war zones, complained Tuesday of censorship by military authorities in Iraq. A soldier with the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division patrols the streets of eastern Mosul, Iraq, on June 16. In a story on its Web site, the newspaper known as Stripes said the military violated a congressional mandate of editorial independence by rejecting a request to embed reporter Heath Druzin with the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division, which is attempting to secure the city of Mosul. The military cited various problems in Druzin's reporting on previous embed assignments with units of the division, according to the story. One example noted by the military was a March 8 story that said many Mosul residents would like the American soldiers to leave and hand over security tasks to Iraqi forces, the Stripes Web site said. ""Despite the opportunity to visit areas of the city where Iraqi Army leaders, soldiers, national police and Iraqi police displayed commitment to partnership, Mr. Druzin refused to highlight any of this news,"" Maj. Ramona Bellard, a public affairs officer, wrote in denying Druzin's embed request, according to the Stripes story. A military official in Iraq defended the move to turn down the reporter's request. ""U.S. Army units in Iraq remain committed to the media embed program and appreciate objective media reporting,"" said Lt. Col. David H. Patterson Jr., a spokesman for Multi-National Corps-Iraq. ""The relationship that Druzin established with the command during a previous embed did not facilitate being invited back."" Patterson added that Druzin was welcome to embed in another unit and that the 1st Cavalry Division was open to having a reporter other than Druzin. ""Accusations of censorship are without merit,"" Patterson said. Other allegations against Druzin by the military included that he used quotes out of context, behaved unprofessionally and persisted in asking Army officials for permission to use a computer to file a story during a communications blackout period, the Stripes story said. Terry Leonard, editorial director at Stars and Stripes, denied the Army's allegations, calling Druzin's previous reporting on the division accurate and fair. ""To simply say 'you can't send him because we didn't like what he wrote' is unacceptable,"" Leonard said. He noted that Congress set up Stripes as an independent newspaper so that ""no commander can decide what news troops in the field receive."" Army officials have offered to allow a different Stripes reporter to embed with the division or to allow Druzin to embed with a different Army unit in Kirkuk, Leonard said. Stripes rejected those offers because the military has no right to deflect coverage from Mosul or decide which Stripes reporter covers its operations, Leonard said. ""To deny Mr. Druzin an embed under the reasons stated by Maj. Bellard is a direct challenge to the editorial independence of this newspaper,"" Leonard wrote in his appeal to the decision, according to the Stripes story.

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Two U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers were killed by a homemade bomb while supporting anti-terror operations on an island in the southern Philippines, Army officials said Thursday. Staff Sgt. Jack M. Martin III, left, and Sgt. 1st Class Christopher D. Shaw were killed Tuesday. Sgt. 1st Class Christopher D. Shaw, 37, and Staff Sgt. Jack M. Martin III, 26, died after a bomb exploded Tuesday near their Humvee on the island of Jolo, said Lt. Col. David King. Both soldiers were based at Fort Lewis, about 40 miles south of Seattle. King said the soldiers were working with members of the Filipino military on a project to build a school when they were killed. One Filipino soldier was also killed, and two more were wounded, he said. Tuesday's bombing, King said, was the second fatal attack on Americans working with the Filipinos. In 2002, a U.S. Marine was killed by a bomb set by the militant group Abu Sayyaff. It was Shaw's second deployment to the Philippines and the first for Martin, who served in Iraq, according to a news release from U.S. Army Special Forces Command. ""We lost a husband, father, son, brother and uncle,"" Shaw's family said. ""Chris was a man who deeply loved his family and believed that he was making a difference in the fight against terror."" Shaw was married with five children, according to the Army release. Both men were awarded the Bronze Star, Purple Heart and Meritorious Service Medal posthumously. Jolo is a well known stronghold for Abu Sayyaff, which is fighting to establish a separate Muslim state. The U.S. military is providing support and training to the Philippines in the battle against the terrorist group, which has ties to al Qaeda. King said it was not immediately clear who was responsible for the latest bombing. ""Abu Sayyaff has not claimed responsibility,"" he said. ""It's still being investigated if they were responsible, but the Filipino military is certainly going down that road."" About 600 U.S. military personnel serve in the Philippines at any one time, King said. Their mission is to assist the Filipino military and build support among the civilian population, he said. U.S. soldiers taking part in the mission are not allowed to engage militants unless acting in self defense. ""Despite what Hollywood portrays about Special Forces being the tip of the spear,"" King said, ""a good part of the mission is developmental projects like helping local schools and building wells.""","Christopher D.

"Athens (CNN) -- The new Greek government, formed after four days of horse-trading by three party leaders, is the country's first coalition in 60 years. Since 1952, a combination of electoral systems and political polarization produced a comfortable single party majority every time an election was held in Greece. This glorified tradition was supposed to provide the country with stable governments and strong leadership, as two big parties were alternating in power. But after 60 years -- or at least 38, counting from the collapse of the military dictatorship in 1974 -- it has provided the country with an ossified political class, inept public service, deep-routed clientelism and omnipresent corruption. A retired public servant once described to me the process: ""When parties alternate in power after an election, what goes on in the public service is a hand over from one mafia organization to its rival."" Ministers walk into their fiefs, escorted by dozens of political counselors who take over from the counselors of the previous minister and do the job, instead of the top public servants, who are discarded, unless they are party loyalists. Public service has thus become gradually annexed to a party system, distributing the spoils of power. Parliament has been subdued to party leaders, as members of the majority usually express loyalty to the leader, waiting their turn for a ministerial post. Justice has been also partly subdued: since the heads of the three supreme courts are chosen by the government, career judges learn that they have to have friends in politics, if they wish to have a chance at the top jobs. The result of decades of single party majorities was a special brand of democratic regime. Let's call it ""partitocracy:"" Two big parties running the country -- and killing it softly, by bribing it to its death. Does this explain Greece's present economic woes? In part, yes. Greece was the first victim of a euro-wide crisis, which would have hit its small, open, vulnerable economy even if the country were run by the wisest of men with the integrity of monks. But partitocracy has certainly precipitated the crisis, made Greece the hardest hit among all peripheral economies and, most importantly, made it almost impossible for Greece to reform itself out of the crisis. Public service reform, tax collection reform, electoral law reform are made impossible, because an unreformed party system would always treat reform as a deadly threats. So, yes! Forming a coalition government, with intra-party checks and balances and the presence of a newcomer, a party that has not participated as yet in corrupt party politics, might be good news for the country. I am not sure the new government will prove able to negotiate a better deal with its European partners or lucky enough to live through a change in the core European policies that will address the fundamentals of the euro crisis. But I hope that at least it can rid Greece of its main plague: partitocracy.","New Greek government, formed after four days of horse-trading, is country's first coalition in 60 years .

"(CNN) -- The White House indicated Wednesday that a report and a photo from the controversial low-altitude New York flyover by a 747 plane used as Air Force One could be released soon. A 911 caller on the day of the flyover said, ""There's a plane falling. There is a big aircraft falling like 9/11."" Earlier, White House officials had said that there were no plans to release photos to the public. But the tone seemed to change on Wednesday. ""The report, I believe, will be concluded at some point this week. We'll release its findings and release a photo,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said during his daily press briefing. The review, led by Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina, will focus on ""why that decision was made and to ensure that it never happens again,"" Gibbs said. The flyover, officials said, was a training mission -- it was also a government-sanctioned photo shoot. Military officials also estimate that the mission and the photo shoot, aimed at updating file photos of Air Force One -- cost $328,835 in taxpayer money. But they said ""the hours would have been flown regardless, and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission."" The photo shoot, which President Obama said he was ""furious"" with, happened on April 27. The image of a low-flying plane accompanied by an F-16 fighter jet sent some New Yorkers into the streets and into a panic -- reminding them of the tragic 9/11 attacks on the city. Building evacuations also took place across the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey. Read more of Obama's reaction . White House Military Office Director Louis Caldera later apologized for the flyover. Witnesses reported seeing the plane circle over the Upper New York Bay near the Statue of Liberty before flying up the Hudson River.  Watch the plane fly over Manhattan » . A YouTube video showed people standing in a parking lot, watching the plane approach. As it nears, they begin to run. ""Run, run!"" said one person. ""Oh my God,"" cried another. A 911 call, released later by the Hudson County Sheriff's Department in New Jersey, illustrated the fear and panic felt by residents since the 9/11 attacks. ""There's a plane falling. There is a big aircraft falling like 9/11,"" a man says to the operator. ""Everybody is running and people are crying and panicking."" CNN iReporter Tom Kruk, who saw the plane and took a photo, called the sight of the aircraft low in the sky ""unsettling."" Mayor Michael Bloomberg was visibly angry last week. ""I'm annoyed -- furious is a better word -- that I wasn't told,"" he said, adding that the decision by the White House Military Office and Federal Aviation Administration to withhold details about the flight were ""ridiculous"" and ""poor judgment."" But according to Air Force Capt. Anna Carpenter, local law enforcement agencies and the FAA had been notified of the exercise. New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne confirmed that department had been alerted about the flight ""with directives to local authorities not to disclose information about it."" That decision riled local media. ""Given that we are not big on reminders of 9/11, we could have done without the whole thing. But the FAA outdunced itself by asking the NYPD to keep the photo op a secret, as if no one would look up and say, 'What the hell?' "" the New York Daily News said on April 28. The New York Post, in its editorial on the same day, said: ""The FAA had long preferred to keep passengers ignorant of these dangers. Better to have people panic, it seems, at the sudden sight of low-flying aircraft over Lower Manhattan. ... Someone needs to straighten out these folks -- quick."" The controversy had some questioning President Obama's declaration of a new era of openness, who on January 21, said: ""The old rules said that if there was a defensible argument for not disclosing something to the American people, then it should not be disclosed. That era is now over."" So why, exactly, didn't that initially apply to the photos? An advocate for government disclosure said it should, and that it's ""silly"" and ""absurd"" to withhold them.  Watch more on the photo flap » . ""These are public records because they were done on government time, with government resources, and government personnel,"" said Patrice McDermott of openthegovernment.org. In New York, news that the photos might not be released reignited public outrage over the incident. ""It doesn't seem right,"" said Kurt Wallin from New Jersey. ""If we spent the money to have these photos taken, they should be available for the public to see."" Emily Ritter from Park City, Utah, added: ""I feel like maybe they're covering it up because it's been seen in a bad light already ... maybe they are still worried about their image and don't want to be seen in a bad light.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Vietnam veteran and Bronze Star recipient who volunteered to return to the Army and serve in Afghanistan became the oldest U.S. service member to die in combat there, the U.S. military announced Friday. First Sgt. Jose San Nicolas Crisostomo was killed by a roadside bomb in Kabul on Tuesday while riding in an armored Humvee. His body was flown to the United States early Thursday morning. Crisostomo of Spanaway, Washington, was 59. He would have turned 60 later this month, according to KING television in Seattle, Washington. He was one of a very few service members who served in Vietnam and in current U.S. military operations, his record shows. He twice received the Bronze Star, which is awarded to U.S. troops for combat valor. Crisostomo also received the Purple Heart for being wounded in combat, according to his records. It was not clear from his official records if he received the medals for combat in Vietnam or Afghanistan. His records also indicate he received numerous other commendations. He also served during the first Gulf War in 1991 and received the Kuwait Liberation Medal. He jointed the Army in 1969 and retired in 1993, then volunteered to serve again in 2008. According to his records, his position in the Army was automated logistical specialist, but it was unclear in what capacity he was serving while in Afghanistan. Earlier this year, a 60-year-old soldier was killed in Iraq, becoming the oldest U.S. service member killed in either the war in Iraq or the war in Afghanistan.","First Sgt.

"Washington (CNN) -- Kenneth Melson, acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, is expected to resign under pressure, perhaps in the next day or two, in the wake of the controversy over Operation Fast and Furious, two senior federal law enforcement sources said Monday. In the operation, straw buyers were allowed to purchase illegally large numbers of weapons, some of which ended up in the hands of cartels in Mexico. Attorney General Eric Holder will meet Tuesday with Andrew Traver, head of the ATF field office in Chicago, about possibly becoming the agency's acting director, according to senior federal law enforcement sources, who are familiar with the details of the controversy. The Justice Department refused comment. White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters he had no new information on the issue. The operation has come under intense criticism since the December killing of a U.S. Border Patrol officer. Operation Fast and Furious was ""a colossal failure of leadership,"" Peter Forcelli, a supervisor at the bureau's Phoenix field office, said recently. The program focused on following people who legally bought weapons that were then transferred to criminals and destined for Mexico. But instead of intercepting the weapons when they switched hands, Operation Fast and Furious called for ATF agents to let the guns ""walk"" and wait for them to surface in Mexico, according to a report by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The idea was that once the weapons in Mexico were traced back to the straw purchasers, the entire arms smuggling network could be brought down. Instead, the report argues, letting the weapons slip into the wrong hands was a deadly miscalculation that resulted in preventable deaths, including that of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. Terry was killed last year north of the Mexican border in Arizona after confronting bandits believed to be preying on illegal immigrants. Two weapons found near the scene of the killing were traced to Fast and Furious. ""I was flabbergasted. I couldn't believe it at first,"" Terry's mother, Josephine, said when she learned the ATF may have let some of the guns used in the attack slip through its fingers. Terry's relatives said they want all those involved in his killing and who helped put the weapons in their hands to be prosecuted. ""We ask that if a government official made a wrong decision, that they admit their error and take responsibility for his or her actions,"" Robert Heyer, Terry's cousin and family spokesman, said in a hearing last week by the House panel. The committee's chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, called the operation ""felony stupid."" As many as 2,000 semiautomatic rifles reached the hands of cartels as a result, and Issa said the top two ATF officials were briefed on the program regularly. In Mexico, the case has drawn nationwide attention and sharp criticism from top officials, who have long stressed that U.S. weapons are fueling the country's drug war. The Mexican attorney general's office demanded a quick U.S. investigation of the matter in March and said authorities must hold accountable anyone who was responsible for the operation. ""As the United States government has signaled, the government of Mexico was not informed of any operation that would include the controlled transport of weapons to Mexico,"" the office said.","NEW: Chicago ATF field office head set to meet with attorney general about job, sources say .

"PURCELLVILLE, Virginia (CNN) -- When the Army flew home the body of Spc. Stephan Mace from Afghanistan, his mother climbed aboard a small jet with the flag-draped coffin for the last leg of his trip. Vanessa Adelson escorted the body of her son, Stephan Mace, on the final leg of the journey from Afghanistan. Vanessa Adelson would not let her 21-year-old son make his final journey home alone. ""I brought him into this world, and he was my baby,"" she said. ""I thought it was my responsibility as a mother to bring him home."" Mace and seven other soldiers were killed this month in a Taliban attack on their remote outpost in eastern Afghanistan, making it the deadliest battle for U.S. troops in Afghanistan since July 2008.  Watch mother prepare to bury son » . All eight were assigned to the 3rd Squadron, 61st Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, based at Fort Carson, Colorado. The October 3 battle saw Taliban insurgents at one point surging past the outer perimeter of Forward Operating Base Keating in Afghanistan's Kamdesh district. The battle lasted about 12 hours, with the most ferocious fighting raging for about seven hours. The base, in a valley, is surrounded by ridge lines where the insurgents were able to fire down at U.S. and Afghan troops. The facility had been scheduled to be closed within days, CNN later learned. Three days after the deadly fight, Mace's mother attended the Dignified Transfer of her son, then returned home with him from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Since May, Mace had been on his first deployment in Afghanistan, following a childhood dream of joining the Army. He planned to continue his career in service after his Army stint by joining the Department of Homeland Security or the CIA, his mother said. Instead, he was buried Monday in Arlington National Cemetery. With an escort platoon and band, a horse-drawn caisson arrived with the flag-draped casket at Section 60 in Arlington National Cemetery. It is a section set aside for the casualties of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mace's mother, walking with a military escort, met the procession as pallbearers lifted the casket from the platform to gently bring it graveside. U.S. Army Secretary John McHugh was among the high-ranking officials who delivered condolences to Mace's family and friends gathered for the funeral. Although reporters and TV crews were allowed to cover the ceremony, they were held at a distance where remarks could not easily be heard. The casket team prepared three American flags as part of the ceremony. The flag on the casket was crisply folded and presented to Mace's mother. Two additional flags were presented to his father Larry Mace, and his grandparents, John and Mary Kay Petro. U.S. Army Brig. Gen Reuben Jones kneeled as he handed each flag to Mace's kin, and spent a few moments speaking with them. The dead soldier's brothers, Matthew, Bradley and Christopher, also attended the funeral. A seven-member firing party launched three volleys, a bugler played ""Taps,"" and a bagpiper played ""Amazing Grace."" Back in Mace's small, tight-knit community in Purcellville, Virginia, many found it hard to believe  the solemn military procession through the center of town earlier this month was the last they would ever see of their friend. ""If I could describe Stephan, I would picture him flying through the air on a dirt bike living his life on the edge,"" said Sam Chapman, childhood friend and football buddy. ""If more people in this country had the passion and the determination and the courage that Stephan had, it would without a doubt be a better place. He was just a great guy.""  Watch friends remember him as gridiron tough » . Mace, described as a Moto Cross champion, football player, hunter and all around fun-loving, loyal friend, was the kind of child that coaches and teachers remember. And when his body was brought back to Purcellville, the community turned out in support. Hundreds of people lined the streets, saluting and waving flags as Mace's family brought him home. ""It was great to the see the kids and the families stand there and when the motorcade crossed the crest of the hill [into town] it was just silence.... It was holy,"" said Purcellville Mayor Robert Lazaro. ""I think we wanted to say to the Mace family, 'Thank you. We respect what your son has done for us.' "" Mace was awarded six medals for his service, including a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. But for his mother, the most precious is the medal of St. Christopher, the patron saint of travelers, that her son wore into battle. She gave him the medal when he was 15 and preparing for a trip to South Africa. Now, after speaking to one of Mace's friends who survived the outpost attack, Adelson knows her son reached for that medal in his last moments. She was told that in his last moments alive, Mace took off his medal and gave it to his fellow soldiers. ""That's how Stephan was,"" Adelson said. ""Here this kid is dying, and he was more worried about the other soldiers that he took his St. Christopher off and gave it to them."" She has also learned her son lived for about half an hour after sustaining wounds to the chest and leg. Adelson finds this detail comforting. ""I'm glad Stephan didn't die right away because he was allowed to give that one gift to his unit and give them the St. Christopher and that he also was able to feel God come to him and take him away,"" she said. ""That he was able to ponder and have a last chance, a last moment, to think about his family and have God take him.""","NEW: Soldier laid to rest Monday at Arlington National Cemetery .

"London (CNN) -- European leaders recently thrashed out a deal aimed at ending months of uncertainty over the future of the euro and resolving an escalating debt crisis that has pushed several economies to the brink of collapse. The eurozone fiscal pact has to be ratified by 12 participating nations. The UK refused to sign up to the deal and now Ireland has called a referendum on the treaty -- a decision that could cause difficulties for the agreement. So what was originally agreed in the treaty negotiations? The ""fiscal compact"" outlines the closer integration of the national budgets of the 17 eurozone countries. A new legal framework and greater fiscal scrutiny will be imposed to avoid a repetition of the dubious financial practices that triggered the crisis. The treaty also agrees to strengthen mechanisms that guarantee short-term stability to euro economies in hot water. The main points are: . • The legal framework will see those signed up to the deal effectively hand more sovereign powers over to centralized European control. • Under the new deal, eurozone nations must be deliver ""balanced"" budgets, designed to ensure there is no repeat of the overspending and under taxation that left Greece in need of a bailout. All plans to issue national debt must be reported in advance. • The current European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the money-lending safety net created by the eurozone last year to combat the crisis, will be phased out in mid-2013. • The implementation of the eurozone's permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), brought forward to 2012, will run alongside the existing fund for about a year. • Voting rules in the European Stability Mechanism will be changed to allow emergency decisions to be passed with an 85% qualified majority -- an attempt to move away from the deadlock that has stymied earlier bailouts. Where will the money come from? Bailout money comes from selling bonds guaranteed by eurozone countries. The bonds are bought by investors --- which can include countries like Japan --- in return for interest. The cash raised is then lent to the eurozone countries in trouble. The EFSF was set up in a hurry after Greece's May 2010 bailout, and was only ever meant to be temporary. Its lending firepower has been boosted to €440 billion from an original €250 billion. The ESM will get €700 billion in funds paid in by eurozone countries relative to the size of their economies. That cash will likely come from national treasuries. That chunk of cash sitting as back-up means the ESM will be able to lend up to €500 billion when it is fully operational. The €200 billion earmarked for the IMF will come from Europe's national central banks. It will likely come from the banks' reserve funds, although the details are not yet agreed. What sanctions can be imposed on countries that breach the deal? The deal says there will be ""automatic consequences"" including possible sanctions if member states exceed a 3% deficit ceiling --- in other words, greatly spend beyond their means. There will be graduated financial sanctions for those countries which consistently breach the ceiling. What are the consequences for the financial markets? Global stocks were mixed after the deal was unveiled and analysts warn only time will tell if it can work. The plan could supply short term stability but previous experience on euro crisis measures shows relief can be brief. Elisabeth Afseth, of Evolution Securities, says its success may depend on whether markets believe Europe's politicians will stick to tighter financial supervision. Has everyone agreed to the deal? No. Talks have been fraught and the resulting deal threatens to become one of the most divisive issues the 27-nation European Union has ever faced. Some European Union nations have balked at ceding further powers to EU authorities and have threatened to walk away. Some say this will result in a two-tier European Union. So who is in and who is out? All 17 eurozone nations and six other EU states outside the euro area have signed up. Initially, four countries cast doubt on the deal, complaining that it sweeps away some of the away hard-fought foundations of the European Union. Sweden's Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt told CNN that he had no mandate for treaty change. But, alongside Hungary and the Czech Republic, he said his country would leave the door open. This leaves Britain, under Prime Minister David Cameron, alone among the 27 European Union nations to point-blank refuse to sign. Cameron said the treaty failed to safeguard Britain's voice in crucial policy decisions over the European single market and financial services sector. He said he had effectively vetoed an original deal, forcing German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to forge ahead with a treaty that will be subservient to EU regulations. Ireland has decided to hold a referendum on the fiscal pact because under the Irish constitution the people have to vote to ratify any significant transfer of sovereignty to Europe. It is likely to take at least three months to organize the referendum. The Irish have twice rejected EU treaties, only to approve them in second referendums. Is this the beginning of the end for the European Union as we know it? The treaty has exposed deep divisions between European Union members -- chiefly Britain and the rest of the bloc. This sets the stage for a series of legal challenges as Britain strives to ensure the treaty does not result in a wholesale restructuring of the EU. With Britain forcing the treaty to operate outside EU mechanisms, there could be an appetite among the rest of Europe to cold shoulder the UK and concentrate resources within their new club. That said, Britain's prior refusal to join the euro and pervading ""euro scepticism"" could just mean the new treaty reinforces the status quo, albeit with frostier relations. So will this solve the crisis? The new treaty was not due to be finalized until March this year -- after which it will have to be ratified by all participating countries. The Irish vote will likely delay this process. Even aside from the potential spanners in the works presented by Britain, Hungary, Sweden and the Czech Republic, grim prospects for the euro and European Union still lurk on the horizon. Ideally, everyone will stick to the new rules, and those countries that require emergency bailouts will be granted them, allowing the European Union to slowly put its debt problems behind it. The danger is that with politically-unpopular austerity measures biting deep, the new stricter controls on government borrowing will become unworkable. This could lead to an evaporation of investor confidence, the collapse of debt-exposed banks, an emptying of government coffers, a nosedive by share markets, and bleak prospects for the euro.","""Fiscal compact"" lays out tighter financial rules for eurozone countries .

"Washington (CNN) -- Jewish voters, a typically reliable bloc for the Democratic Party, are now the focus of Democrats intent on keeping their support and Republicans who see an opportunity to pull them in after New York's recent special congressional election. Longtime New York Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf said the election, in which a Republican won the historically Democratic district, was in part a reaction to the president's approach to Israel. Sheinkopf said the contest served as a ""liberating device"" for Jewish voters and not just Orthodox Jews, who tend to be more socially conservative. ""It is very unlikely he gets large portions of the pro-Israel community back; it's too late. Something extraordinarily miraculous would have to occur,"" Sheinkopf said. ""There is a general sense of betrayal that this guy just doesn't understand who these Jews are. ""He got his first warning,"" Sheinkopf added. Signs of tension between the president and Jewish supporters surfaced before the New York election and are heightened with the spotlight on the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, in which Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is expected to submit an application for statehood to the Security Council. Will the GOP push for Jewish votes pay off? The Obama administration has vowed to veto the submission, affirming its longstanding backing for Israel, America's strongest Middle East ally. But many Jews were angered over President Obama's May speech in which he suggested that Israel return to pre-1967 borders with land swaps agreed upon by Israelis and Palestinians. The pre-1967 borders refer to Israel's territory before the Six-Day War that year, in which Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and other territory from neighboring countries. Israelis argue that returning to the former configuration would leave population centers vulnerable and displace settlers. The president's statements were followed by an awkward meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which Netanyahu seemingly lectured Obama in the Oval Office, vowing that Israel would never return to the 1967 lines. In New York, Republican Bob Turner's 8-percentage point victory over Democrat David Weprin in a district held by Democrats since 1923 brought a new focus on Jewish voters, who supported Obama's presidential bid by an overwhelming 78% in 2008. The Democratic loss in the highly Jewish 9th congressional district comes as Obama's polling numbers among Jewish voters, nationally and in New York, have declined. Rep. Anthony Weiner held the seat until he resigned in June after exchanging inappropriate images over social media. Fifty-four percent of Jewish Americans approved of Obama's performance as president in September, compared with 60% in June and 68% in May, according to Gallup polling. A statewide New York poll taken by Siena College in August found Obama's approval at 52% among all Empire State voters and at 49% among the state's Jewish voters. Although Obama received a 67% approval rating among Democrats in the state, he garnered 49% approval from Jewish Democrats. Steve Greenberg, the Siena political poll spokesman, said that the president's poll numbers ""should be better among Jewish voters"" and that last week's election proved that there are no safe districts for the president. ""Even in a safe Democratic district, Obama is not safe, and therefore he clearly has his work cut out for him,"" Greenberg said. However, he said voters are looking at the president in a vacuum instead of against a Republican challenger, when he is likely to fare better, and he cautioned against using the special election as a barometer for the rest of the country. ""There are issues he's got to work on over the next 14 months, but it's not a crisis situation,"" Greenberg said, pointing to the uniqueness of the district's religious electorate, a third of whom are Orthodox Jews, and the heavy role Middle East politics played in the race. CNN exit polling says the national Jewish vote has not surpassed 4% of the total vote in the past five presidential elections. However, a higher concentration of the Jewish population in key presidential voting states, including New York, New Jersey and Florida, could prove important for Democrats and Republicans in 2012. Matt Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition, said the Obama administration's policies toward Israel have left Jews ""concerned"" ahead of the presidential election. He cited the president's criticism of Israeli settlements, his disapproval over construction in Jerusalem and the 1967 border call as reasons for the ill will. ""Because of the failed policies and the harsh criticism as it relates to Israel, (Obama has) got a real problem with Jewish voters across the country,"" Brooks said, calling the New York election a bellwether for the rest of the country over Israel and the economy. ""I'm confident that Republicans will continue to make inroads in 2012 in the Jewish community ... as Jewish voters move away from the Democratic Party,"" Brooks said. On the other side of the aisle, the Democratic National Committee and the Obama White House are ramping up outreach efforts. In an e-mail to Jewish supporters, Ira Forman, Jewish outreach director for the Obama campaign, sought to ""set the record straight."" ""The other side is working hard to distort the President's record, particularly when it comes to his strong support of Israel,"" Forman wrote. ""To set the record straight, it'll be up to supporters like us who know the truth to get the word out."" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications at the White House, said the U.S. and Israel have stood together in ""unprecedented ways"" during the Obama administration. At the White House on Friday, Rhodes said the United States has lent military assistance to Israel to protect itself from incoming missiles and rockets and stood up against the de-legitimization of Israel at the U.N., among other steps. ""We've got a very strong record of support for Israel that should be evident to anybody who shares our concern for the future security and prosperity of Israel,"" Rhodes said. ""The security cooperation is evident; the de-legitimization efforts by us to counter those de-legitimization efforts are evident."" Alan Solow, an outside adviser to the Obama campaign on Jewish issues, said the president's political opponents are mischaracterizing his record on the Middle East. ""We ... need to fight back against those misrepresentations and clarify the record,"" Solow said. ""We'll go through some ups and downs as events occur, but I think in the end, our belief is that his percentage of the Jewish vote in 2012 will be very similar to what it was in 2008."" David Harris, the executive director for the nonpartisan American Jewish Committee, doled out advice to Democrats and Republicans angling for Jewish support. Democrats need to better explain their Middle East positions to ensure that their support in the Jewish base does not wane, Harris said. ""They need to tell the story better,"" Harris said. ""Don't take your Jewish base for granted."" Meanwhile, Harris said, Republicans have an opportunity to make inroads in the Jewish community through an economic plan and Middle East policy. ""Jews are multi-issue voters. The notion they are single-issue voters is simply wrong,"" Harris said. Jewish voters ""want to have a comfort level they want to believe in their kishkas, in their gut, that the person gets Israel, understands it, grasps why Israel is important to the United States.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A coalition of nearly 70 former federal prosecutors and judges has publicly opposed their former boss, the U.S. government, in a dispute over prosecutorial misconduct. At issue is when defendants cleared of wrongdoing can sue the U.S. Justice Department for ""bad faith"" acts that taint the integrity of the judicial system. The U.S. Supreme Court has been asked to take up the appeal. A federal judge had awarded Ali Shaygan nearly $602,000 in damages and fees after a jury acquitted the Miami doctor on charges relating to the fatal drug overdose of a patient. Shaygan later claimed two assistant U.S. attorneys and a DEA agent ""acted vexatiously"" after the original indictment was filed. Judge Alan Gold concluded, among other things, prosecutors violated disclosure requirements by withholding information from the defendant and the court and by launching a separate ""tactical"" effort to disqualify the doctor's attorney just before the trial was to begin. Gold called the government's conduct ""profoundly disturbing,"" raising ""troubling issues about the integrity of those who wield enormous power over the people they prosecute."" A federal appeals court in Atlanta eventually threw out the lawsuit, saying the trial judge overreached, and that the overall prosecution and allegations on the original indictment were ""objectively valid."" The Justice Department is now expected to ask the justices to dismiss the appeal. A federal law known as the Hyde Amendment allows for damages, including attorney's fees, when a court determines the entire government's ""position of the United States was vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith."" The narrow scope of the law has made it generally difficult for defendants to recoup the costs of botched federal criminal prosecutions by the government. But the group of onetime prosecutors and judges opposing the government on Thursday filed a so-called ""amicus"" legal brief backing the doctor, saying in this case the damages award was appropriate. ""The amici are deeply concerned that the Eleventh Circuit's decision will allow serious prosecutorial misconduct to be excused and, in so doing, will undermine public confidence in our system of justice,"" said attorney Thomas Goldstein, representing the legal coalition. ""If allowed to stand, the [appeals court's] holding will disempower district judges, and send a clear signal that even grave prosecutorial misconduct will generally be overlooked, given the relatively lax standards for instituting federal prosecutions,"" he added. It is somewhat unusual for this large a group of onetime federal prosecutors and judges to come together and strongly oppose the Justice Department's actions in a criminal case. Shaygan is also being supported by other groups, including the Constitution Project and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. The Obama administration has not yet formally reacted to the original appeal by Shaygan or the supporting parties. Government appellate lawyers have until September 10 to file their official response.","Prosecutorial misconduct case involving Miami doctor appealed to U.S. Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- Imagine an apple-cheeked telephone operator from the early 1900s happily plugging in wires to connect Person A to Person B. Now imagine a kajillion operators doing that at the same time. That's kind of how the WWW works, linking up humans so that we're now a mere 4.74 degrees of separation away from any human on Earth (take that, Kevin Bacon!). Much of that interaction is unintentional, the smashing of two particles that happen to sideswipe each other while commenting on the same YouTube video or clicking through Christian Mingle profiles. But sometimes we purposely reach out to join hands across the Internet. And, as with every social interaction online, some people seriously foul up the digital outreach. Here, some basic guidelines for polite e-introductions. When e-mailing a complete stranger . Err on the side of formality, using ""Dear (name)"" over ""Hey!"" Explain exactly what you want out of an e-mail correspondence (""to tell you about my small business"" or ""to see if you'd be open to a brief informational interview"" makes a lot more sense than ""to network with you"") and add a little flattery to sweeten the deal (i.e., why you found the target worth e-mailing). Keep the whole thing to a paragraph or less and hope for the best. Should it go unanswered, you can just blame his or her overtaxed inbox. When contacting someone you've met . Begin by reminding them of how you met with an identifying detail. If it was a networking event, for example, simply announcing, ""It was great to meet you at the anachronistic Mardi Gras-themed mixer last week!"" won't do the trick. You've got to add something like, ""I really enjoyed chatting about the true definition of a beignet and your years at Company X."" When you know Person A and Person B and are introducing the two . Several times in life, you'll have to play the role of connector, answering a friend's plea to connect her to someone else in your circle. This is the kind of delicate social dance that used to need much instruction -- witness the flipping long chapter on doing it in real life within Emily Post's 1922 tome, ""Etiquette."" When connecting, say, a nonprofit employee who's planning to ask your D-list celebrity friend to participate in a phone-a-thon, the most polite option is to privately contact the fading star first and ask if she'd mind if you linked them up. If you're confident that everyone involved will be happy with the connection, though, you can just go ahead and put them both on a ""Bleeding Heart, meet Has-Been"" type e-mail and then slip graciously into the background as they have their conversation. Oh, and pay attention to which e-mail addresses you're giving out -- if you're connecting a job seeker with an employed friend for networking purposes, he'll probably prefer to be contacted via his work address, not his private one. When asking your friend to introduce you to someone . After your benevolent contact has made the intro, take him off the reply-all chain (so he isn't trapped in the e-mail crossfire as you two discuss the cupcakes-for-kitten-spaying fundraiser you're planning), and separately write to her to say thanks. Then follow the immortal words of the Beatles and just let it be. Don't ask her to follow up with you if the D-lister doesn't respond, and don't blame her for a lack of response. Again, we're all drowning in e-mails, LinkedIn messages, Facebook notes and other beeping and blooping messages. If that person can't help, just go back to the drawing board -- the one with a kajillion operators connecting humans at dizzying rates.","As with every social interaction online, some people seriously foul up the digital outreach .

"(CNN) -- One of the hottest properties in European football, Eden Hazard, has ended months of speculation as to his future by announcing on Twitter he is to join Champions League winners Chelsea. The 21-year-old Belgium international is poised to leave French side Lille and took to the micro-blogging site to reveal his next destination, though the London club haven't yet confirmed the transfer. Hazard won the French league title in 2011 and has scored 20 goals for the club this season. His form attracted attention from a host of clubs including English Premier League champions Manchester City and deposed rivals Manchester United. After a cryptic message on Monday morning when he took to Twitter to announce he had made up his mind, Hazard then later posted: ""I'm signing for the champion's league winner."" Reinventing the wheel: How Guardiola revolutionized football . Chelsea secured their first Champions League crown with a dramatic penalty shootout victory over German club Bayern Munich earlier this month. It sealed a remarkable end to a difficult season in which Portuguese manager Andre Villas-Boas was sacked in March, just nine months after he arrived from Porto. Villas-Boas' assistant Roberto Di Matteo -- a former Chelsea player -- took over and led the club to two trophies, winning the English FA Cup two weeks before the Champions League final. Despite his success, Chelsea are yet to confirm whether Di Matteo will stay on beyond his temporary contract, which expires at the end of June. In a further boost for the club, goalkeeper Petr Cech, who saved three penalties in the Champions League shootout, has signed a new four-year deal. The Czech keeper has already made more appearances than any other foreign player in the London club's history, representing Chelsea 369 times. Since joining in 2004 he has won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and two League Cups. He was instrumental in Chelsea's Champions League campaign. ""I am really happy to be part of this great club for another four years,"" Cech told the club's official website. ""I hope the next four years will be as successful as the last eight years I have been at the club."" Chief executive Ron Gourlay added: ""Chelsea fully appreciates the highly significant contribution Petr has made to the most successful period in the club's history, and it is very important to our aim of continuing this level of achievement that he has committed himself to the club until 2016.

"(CNN) -- All entrances to the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge are closed through the holiday weekend as firefighters continue to battle a 10-week-old blaze that has burned well over half the 400,000-acre preserve. Jason Curry, a spokesman for the federal Incident Management Team, said the preserve will be shuttered to the public indefinitely -- at least until authorities, likely with major help from the weather, get it under control. The group is trying to corral what is being called the Honey Prairie Complex Fire. ""Mother Nature is in charge, with both the cause of the fire and the resolution to it,"" he said. Lightning first sparked a fire on April 28 and it has been burning, in some form, ever since -- consuming about 268,000 of the refuge's 402,000 acres. National Weather Service meteorologist Coleen Decker noted that there's no immediate relief in sight. ""We are looking forward to dry conditions, with relative humidity near 30 to 35% (and) temperatures slightly above normal at 95 degrees,"" she said of the upcoming forecast for the region. ""We are not expecting significant precipitation until Tuesday."" Centuries ago, the Native Americans called this area Okefenoka, meaning ""Land of the Trembling Earth,"" according to the refuge's website. Currently, this large swath of territory in south Georgia and north Florida -- which includes cypress forest, lakes and islands, in addition to marsh -- is home to more than 400,000 species of animals including alligators, Sandhill cranes and red-cockaded woodpeckers. While the threat has been ongoing, closures of certain once public parts of the park picked up last month. That includes the June 9 suspension of all boating from Kingfisher Landing, the June 13 closure of the Suwanee Canal Recreation Area and all hiking trails near the east entrance, and the June 16 closure of Stephen C. Foster State Park. While the Okefenokee is best known for its swamp, this moisture has done little to prevent further destruction. One major reason is that the region is in the third year of a drought, significantly decreasing water levels in the region. Another complication is the terrain: The swamp makes it hard for bulldozers and engines to penetrate into certain areas. Curry said six helicopters and 76 fire engines have been assigned to fight the blaze. ""Accessibility is a problem, and you don't want to upset the water flows,"" the spokesman said of the sensitive environmental area. As Curry noted, wildfires are nothing new to the swamp, helping shape the terrain, clear out loose debris and provide good conditions for some vegetation. ""Fire is part of how the swamp forms and continues to do its thing,"" he said. ""It has been part of the swamp for longer than we've been around."" Authorities' primary focus continues to be making sure that the blaze does not engulf any properties surrounding the refuge, something that Curry said was not imminent but could happen at any moment, with a sudden and strong wind shift. The fire has had minimal impact on wildlife, said James Burkhart, fire information officer for the refuge. Turtles and the estimated 10,000 to 12,000 alligators are able to burrow into watery peat beds or below river banks. Burkhart, who worked for more than 30 years as a ranger at the refuge, said a 2007 wildfire was more problematic because of higher sustained winds. Since 1988, a cycle of droughts have contributed to swamp fires, he added. Once visitors are allowed back in, they will be able to enjoy vistas not available for years, Burkhart told CNN. A special treat is seeing wintering Sandhill cranes from mid-November to February, he said. Recent thunderstorms have dropped several inches of rain. But while such sporadic rains may help temporarily slow the fire, nothing has stopped it yet. That will require a significant and notable weather change, most likely in the form of a massive and sustained rainfall. ""It's likely going to take a major weather event -- in other words, rain with a name,"" said Curry, referring to a hurricane, tropical storm or depression. Burkhart said the Okefenokee Swamp symbolizes the ideal environment. ""It's a complete natural ecosystem,"" he said. ""It operates completely on its own."" CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","A wildfire that began April 28 is still raging in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge .

"(CNN) -- Goals rained down in the English Premier League on Saturday, but for once Manchester United played it safe to stay seven points clear at the top of the table. Alex Ferguson's team kept a clean sheet for the first time in six games, beating West Bromwich Albion 2-0 at home in a match that had been in danger of succumbing to the UK's recent wet weather. By contrast, second-placed Manchester City scrambled a 4-3 win at Norwich, Tottenham came from behind to claim third with a 2-1 victory at Sunderland and Arsenal moved fifth after triumphing 7-3 at home to Newcastle. All eight EPL matches provided goals -- 35 in all -- with Stoke drawing 3-3 with Southampton, Wigan beating Aston Villa 3-0, Swansea winning 2-1 at Fulham and Reading ending a long winless run by defeating West Ham 1-0. United edged a controversial seven-goal thriller against Newcastle on Wednesday, showing the defensive frailties that have plagued the 19-time English champions this season, but the return of Nemanja Vidic helped steady the side against a West Brom team that has dropped to seventh place. The visitors went behind in the ninth minute when Gareth McAuley deflected Ashley Young's cross past his own keeper -- former United player Ben Foster -- and substitute Robin van Persie wrapped it up at the end with a curling shot for his league-leading 14th goal this season. Ferguson was widely criticized for harassing match officials during the Newcastle match and for claiming that Van Persie ""could have been killed"" during the 1-1 draw with Swansea, but he kept his comments low-key this time. ""The pitch was a problem for us with the way we pass the ball -- it slowed our game down a bit,"" said Ferguson, who turns 71 on Monday. ""We did well in the first half, we dominated at times, but you must give credit to West Brom who had more of the game in the second half and were a threat with their crosses. ""They had quite a bit of possession into the second period so we decided to bring Robin and Paul Scholes on just to settle us down a bit and they did that well. ""It's a good result considering how heavy the pitch was -- that's two games in four days on it and it's not easy. The slowness of it killed our speed."" Blog: Has Ferguson gone too far? West Brom boss Steve Clarke agreed with the officials' decision to go ahead with the match after a late inspection of the waterlogged pitch. ""We used to play on pitches like that all the time. You don't look for games to be called off for no reason and there was no reason today,"" he said. Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini was not so happy after his defending champions bounced back from the 1-0 defeat by Sunderland. Recalled striker Edin Dzeko scored twice inside four minutes, but Norwich got back into the game after Samir Nasri was sent off just before halftime following an altercation with Sebastien Bassong. ""Both players came forward with their heads, so if you are going to send off one, then you have to send off both, not only Samir,"" Mancini said. ""I am disappointed with Samir, and he will pay his fine, but the decision was not correct."" The Italian will go into the New Year trying to retrieve a sizable deficit, though City overhauled United's eighth-point lead last season to win the club's first title since 1968. ""It's not important to look at the table because it's not final but we need only to work, to win and then maybe we'll look again at the table in February,"" he said. Dzeko almost had a hat-trick, but his 67th-minute shot hit the post and went into the net off Norwich goalkeeper Mark Bunn for 4-2, which was ruled to be an own goal. Russell Martin netted his second on 75, but Norwich stayed 11th after a third successive defeat. Tottenham moved a point above London rivals Chelsea, who travel to sixth-placed Everton on Sunday. Sunderland went ahead against the run of play as skipper John O'Shea scored his first goal for the club five minutes before halftime, but Carlos Cuellar headed into his own net after the break and Aaron Lennon's 51st-minute winner left Spurs six points behind City. However, Tottenham star Gareth Bale -- a reported target for Real Madrid in the January transfer window -- was frustrated after being booked for diving for the third time this season. ""That's three times now I've been clipped and booked for no reason,"" said the Wales winger, who will miss Tuesday's clash with Reading following his fifth yellow card this season. ""People keep saying I'm diving, but if there's contact it's not diving. Referees need to look more closely."" Theo Walcott bolstered his claims for a regular starting place as a central striker with his second-hat-trick this season in Arsenal's topsy-turvy win over 15th-placed Newcastle, which put the London side two points behind Chelsea. The visitors leveled three times as Demba Ba netted twice to take his league tally to 13, but Walcott's treble was complemented by a late double from substitute forward Olivier Giroud after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski also scored. Walcott has yet to agree a new contract, and the England international will have no lack of interest from other clubs after taking his tally to 14 goals in all competitions this season -- only Van Persie has more with 17. Stoke stayed eighth after coming from 3-1 down against third-bottom Southampton, extending the club's unbeaten home record to nine matches thanks to substitute striker Cameron Jerome's spectacular late equalizer. Defender Matthew Upson had reduced the deficit to 3-2 before teammate Steven Nzonzi was sent off for a challenge on Jack Cork. Swansea moved up to ninth as Fulham's stand-in keeper David Stockdale gifted the visitors two goals -- the first to striker Danny Graham, playing in place of the Welsh club's top scorer Michu, and the second to Canadian midfielder Jonathan de Guzman. Bryan Ruiz pulled one back after Dimitar Berbatov hit the crossbar, and the Bulgarian had a late effort ruled out for offside as the London side ended the year just four points above the relegation zone in 14th place. Wigan moved out of the bottom three after handing fellow strugglers Aston Villa a third successive defeat that will increase the pressure on manager Paul Lambert after the 8-0 demolition by Chelsea and a 4-0 home loss to Spurs. Reading stayed second from bottom despite the promoted club winning for only the second time this season, thanks to a fifth-minute goal from Russia striker Pavel Pogrebnyak that extended 12th-placed West Ham's winless run to four matches.","Manchester United will go into 2013 with a seven-point lead in English Premier League .

"(CNN)  -- Passengers flying into the United States from abroad should expect additional security measures at U.S. and international airports after a passenger detonated a device aboard a flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands to Detroit, Michigan, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. Measures will include increased pat-downs and gate screening, as well as having to stow carry-ons and personal items, including pillows. ""We ask that passengers follow the instructions of international security and flight crews,"" the TSA said. Security has also been ramped up at U.K. airports and at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, where the suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, went through ""normal security procedures"" before boarding the flight, according to security officials. Abdulmutallab, 23, was charged in a federal criminal complaint Saturday with attempting to destroy the plane Friday on its final approach to Detroit Metropolitan Airport, and placing a destructive device on the aircraft, the Department of Justice said. At Schiphol, secondary screenings were boosted Saturday with body searches and bag checks, officials said. As part of the increased security, passengers on a flight Saturday from Brussels, Belgium, to Dulles Airport in Virginia were not allowed to leave their seats for the last hour of the flight, a traveler told CNN. Niki Yazzie said the flight crew told the passengers that they had to remain in their seats with their seatbelts fastened and couldn't have any items, such as pillows or blankets, covering their laps; everything was stowed away. Passenger Johnny McDonald, who was on a U.S. domestic flight, told CNN he saw officials X-ray milk parents had brought for infants and saw many people patted down. ""They X-rayed the milk I don't know how many times,"" McDonald said. ""And then they took the milk out and sampled each and every bottle of the milk. I've never seen that before."" Secondary searches are also being introduced much more widely at airports around the world, CNN's Richard Quest reported. An official with the TSA told CNN that along with increased security at airports, screening likely will take longer. No details were provided on all the steps being taken. The official advised travelers to allow for extra time before their flights. There will be no changes in screening requirements and no change in the number of carry-on bags allowed. A note was released earlier this week by the Office of Intelligence and Analysis that said FBI officials ""currently have no specific, credible intelligence indicating plans by al Qaeda or other terrorist groups to conduct attacks in the United States during the 2009 holiday season.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Flight attendants in coming months will get the same expedited screening at airport checkpoints available to airline pilots, the Transportation Security Administration said Monday. In a move intended to reduce checkpoint congestion while improving security, flight attendants will be allowed to display credentials instead of undergoing physical screening. They will still be subject to random, unpredictable searches, however. TSA Administrator John Pistole said the change is in keeping with his philosophy of ""risk-based"" security, because it speeds up screening of known ""low-risk"" travelers, while allowing TSA screeners to focus on unknown travelers. Authorities investigate needles in sandwiches . Flight attendant representatives have long argued that flight attendants deserve the same treatment as pilots because they undergo identical background checks and are entrusted with access to the cockpit. The Known Crewmember program is ""good news"" for U.S. aviation, flight attendants and the traveling public, said Veda Shook, head of the Association of Flight Attendants. ""We are the last line of defense in security aboard the aircraft,"" Shook said. In addition, the program will eliminate flight attendants' ""uncomfortable"" practice of jumping to the head of the security line so they can make their flights on time, she said. High-flying family shares travel secrets . In May, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security instructed the TSA to include flight attendants in the Known Crewmember program. Flight attendants -- there are 90,000 of them in the United States -- will be eligible if they work for U.S. airlines that participate in the program and are flying from U.S. airports. When flight attendants present their credentials to the TSA officers, the identifications will be checked against an up-to-date database of program participants. The TSA has been phasing in the program for pilots. To date, nearly 1.4 million pilots have been screened at checkpoints under the new system. How to deal with air turbulence . The TSA expects it could take up to 12 months for airlines and their service providers to make the necessary system modifications and fully implement this change. Flight attendants could begin to experience expedited screening as early as this fall, and by year's end it could be implemented at more than 30 airports.","Flight attendants are being added to the Known Crewmember program .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt struggled Sunday to retake control of a vital northeastern port city after a riot broke out following news that 21 people had been sentenced to death for their roles in last year's deadly clashes at a soccer match at the Port Said stadium. The riot in Port Said follows other violence, which was tied more to unrest over Egypt's current leadership. They are nonetheless symptomatic of instability and insecurity two years after longtime President Hosni Mubarak was ousted. By early Sunday morning, the death toll in Port Said climbed to 31, according to Dr. Ahmed Omar, a health ministry spokesman, who spoke to state-run EGYNews. At least 322 were injured, including 61 who remained hospitalized, he said. Security forces closed roads in and out of Port Said, which sits along the Mediterranean Sea at the northern entrance of the Suez Canal. They were also fighting to take back a police station and other government buildings that were either looted and burned or taken over by rioters, according to state media reports. The violence began Saturday outside a prison after relatives of those convicted clashed with police and prison guards, the head of Port Said hospitals told state-run Nile TV. Some of the defendants' relatives tried to storm the Port Said prison to free their loved ones being held inside, interior ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Osama Ismail told Nile TV. A deadly match . They were angry because 21 of their relatives had just been sentenced to death for their role in a February 1, 2012, riot that occurred at the close of a match between Cairo's prestigious Al-Ahly football club and the host Al-Masry team. When the riot was over at the stadium, 73 people were dead and more than 1,000 wounded. Egypt's general prosecutor charged 75 people with premeditated murder and attempted murder, while three Al-Masry officials and nine police officers were charged with ""assisting the murderers."" According to the prosecutor's office, those charged with assisting knew about the assault ahead of time, didn't confiscate weapons in advance, didn't stop them and -- in the case of an electricity engineer who was charged -- turned off the lights directly over the bleachers where the Al-Ahly fans were sitting right after the visiting team wrapped up its 3-1 victory. Fans from both sides bashed each other with rocks and chairs, yet prosecutors claimed the Port Said supporters were also armed with knives and other weapons. Many died after falling from bleachers inside the stadium, while others suffocated. Clashes enter 3rd day . As security forces tried to regain control of the streets in Port Said, clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces in Cairo entered its third day. Police and soldiers used tear gas to quell a sometimes violent demonstration near Cairo's Tahrir Square -- the symbolic center of Egypt's revolution. Demonstrators threw rocks and burned tires and boxes, according to state-run Ahram newspaper. The protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and elsewhere in recent days have focused their anger at current President Mohamed Morsy. The former Muslim Brotherhood leader, who became Egypt's first democratically elected leader last year, has come under fire by some who compared him to Mubarak and said he amassed power for himself and his Islamist allies. He has insisted his moves were necessary to move Egypt forward in the face of pressing issues and persistent obstacles. On Friday -- the anniversary of what some call the January 25 Revolution -- six people were killed in Suez and one in Ismailia, amid clashes involving anti-government protesters and those supportive of Morsy, as well as police. Hundreds more were injured in the unrest nationwide. Journalist Ramy Francis and CNN's Reza Sayah reported from Cairo; CNN's Amir Ahmed reported Atlanta. CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- It is unfortunate that Mike Daisey lied about Apple's labor practices on ""This American Life"" by fabricating some harrowing details about the suffering of workers in China who make iPads and iPhones. But this revelation should not divert attention away from the very real, pressing issue of labor abuses in China. The public radio episode that aired Daisey's falsified account helped set in motion a series of news reports and close scrutiny from the media, forcing Apple to acknowledge that conditions in its supplier factories can be improved and that workers should be treated better. Now, because of Daisey's lies, some people might dismiss the problem of China's labor abuses. They should not. Daisey should not have lied, even if he were doing it to serve a bigger purpose. Daisey's bigger point -- that workers in China are mistreated -- is true. Analysis: Apple, China, Foxconn and the fabulist . Labor abuse in China is hardly confined to Apple's supplier, Foxconn. It is widespread. In some ways, the working conditions in foreign-invested factories such as Foxconn is better than that of domestic factories. Compared with workers in large foreign-invested factories, workers in domestic factories often encounter delayed payment of wages, lack of safety measures and no health care. In an incident in 2003, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao helped a migrant worker reclaim her overdue wage from her employer. To date, unpaid and delayed wages remain one of the most serious problems for migrant workers. Outside of factories, workers such as miners or construction laborers fare even worse since they forgo written employment contracts and face substandard working conditions. In the event of injuries or wages withheld, they cannot even file for legal protections. China has about 153 million migrant workers. According to a 2006 nationwide survey conducted by the government, 86% of them work more than 8 hours every day and more than half of them cannot receive their monthly wages on time. A study from an academic group last year shows that these conditions have not improved. Of course, Chinese workers have not suffered in silence. Wage disputes are on the rise. So has the number of distraught workers who threaten to jump from the top of factory buildings or skyscrapers that they have just built. The plight of Chinese workers is rooted in the skewed power relations between business and labor. In the 1980s and 1990s, local governments often colluded with businesses to keep down labor costs. In the past decade under President Hu Jintao, the government has sought to improve conditions for laborers. A labor contract law was enacted and overt discrimination against migrant workers was lifted. But they are not enough. Migrant workers with little experience or few connections are in a very weak position in large cities. They often take whatever job is available just so that they can survive. Businesses, on the other hand, incur little or no cost when they engage in unfair labor practice. Many existing laws are only good on paper, and businesses face no severe penalty for flouting them. In a country where the government often considers a partial recovery of overdue wages as a success, it's an upward battle for workers. Despite a more tolerant attitude by the government toward labor protests in recent years, no channel exists to translate that into political energy for change. The Chinese government outlaws independent unions so that workers cannot organize or strike collectively. Even if workers have the advantage of people power of their side, they are simply not on par with businesses in terms of political clout. In this context, the spotlight on China's labor problem raised by Daisey and others is important. If multinational corporations follow high standards in their home countries, they should abide by similar rules abroad. And if more of them follow Apple's example in allowing independent groups to inspect their suppliers' labor practice, it will go a long way to helping Chinese workers. Improving conditions in factories such as those owned by Foxconn will affect China's labor market as a whole and help workers gain bargaining power in dealing with domestic factories. We hope that with continued international attention on the plight of Chinese workers, the government eventually will enact meaningful reform that will guarantee workers basic labor rights.

"(CNN) -- Twitter users may value brevity in their messages, but that doesn't mean they don't think about the social implications of language. Is this sign sexist? Some say our language should be more inclusive of both genders. ""Can't we English-speakers just agree upon a gender-neutral pronoun?"" attorney Paul Easton recently Twittered. ""Tired of PC grammar gymnastics."" Easton isn't alone. There have been at least 18 recent tweets about the fact that English has no grammatically correct substitutes for words like ""he,"" ""him,"" and ""his"" that do not have a gender implied. Consider the sentence ""Everyone loves his mother."" The word ""his"" may be seen as both sexist and inaccurate, but replacing it with ""his or her"" seems cumbersome, and ""their"" is grammatically incorrect. ""I find myself spending a lot of time reworking or obsessing over sentences to avoid sexist language, and wonder why we settled on these burdensome conventions rather than popularizing a gender-neutral pronoun,"" Easton said in an e-mail. It turns out that an English speaker's mind can't instantly adopt an imposed new gender-neutral system of pronouns, linguists say. A sudden change in the system of pronouns or other auxiliary words in any language is very difficult to achieve. That's because pronouns are ""function words,"" which connect words and phrases but do not have ""content"" meanings. While new nouns like ""cyberspace"" and verbs like ""to google"" become widespread fairly quickly -- and people often come up with synonyms for ""cool"" -- it's much more difficult to introduce or change function words. The mind just won't incorporate them. ""The function words form a closed club that resists new members,"" Harvard University linguist Steven Pinker writes in his book ""The Language Instinct."" Proposals for gender-neutral pronouns in English began cropping up in the 19th century -- not for reasons of equality, but for the sake of grammatical correctness, said Dennis Baron, professor of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. More than 100 such proposals, including ""thon"" and ""ip,"" have arisen, and none of them has stuck. It wasn't until the 1970s that the issue became about equality for women, Baron said. Today, Internet forums such as Twitter are buzzing about why English doesn't have a good substitute for ""they,"" and what could be done about it. Transgender groups have also taken an interest in the topic -- in fact, the Trans@MIT at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has a gender-neutral pronoun system in its Allies Toolkit. If there were a deeply felt need for gender-neutral pronouns, they would arise naturally and become widespread through popular culture rather than through an educational or governmental mandate, Baron said. But, for now, many people continue to write the phrase ""him or her."" iReport.com: Sneak a peek at a 'Tweetup' gathering of Twitter users . ""Does it make our culture less sexist? Probably not. But it's a nice gesture,"" he said. Signs of sensitivity . While everyone knows that ""men at work"" means ""people working,"" studies have shown that gendered words do make a difference in how we perceive things, said Kathryn Campbell-Kibler, assistant professor of linguistics at The Ohio State University. ""If you ask children to draw 'cavemen,' they do draw cave men,"" she said. The issue has public policy implications, too. In response to a complaint from a local magazine editor, the public works commissioner for Atlanta, Georgia, replaced 50 ""Men Working"" signs with signs that said ""Workers Ahead"" last year and encouraged contractors to use only the gender-neutral signs, said spokeswoman Valerie Bell-Smith. Replacing the signs cost less than $1,000 total, she said. ""There are many women who work in public works, and we want to be respectful and sensitive to the fact that they're out there, too, doing the hard construction work,"" she said. iReport.com: Share your 'tweeting' tips, tech obsessions . Cindy Scott Day, a writer from Granger, Indiana, who recently Twittered about gender-neutral pronouns, said words like ""mailman"" and ""fireman"" have fallen out of use, in favor of ""mail carrier"" and ""firefighter."" The ""biggest dilemma"" is the gender-specific pronoun (he or she) issue, she said. The words that stay, the words that go . The pronouns ""I"" and ""we"" are some of the most ancient words, supporting the idea that function words are very resistant to change. New research from Britain suggests that these words, along with the numbers one, two, three and five, have been fairly consistent for thousands of years. Researchers used a supercomputer to look at how words have been used throughout the centuries across the Indo-European family, which includes English, the Romance languages, the Slavic languages, and Indian tongues such as Hindi. An obvious example of the preservation of an ancient word is ""two."" In Spanish it's ""dos,"" in Slovak it's ""dva,"" in Farsi it's ""do"" and in Hindi it's ""do"" -- all of which are strikingly similar ways of denoting the number two. ""We could time travel and have very limited conversation,"" said Mark Pagel, evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom, who led the study. ""We really believe that we can probably go back 20,000 years with those really, really old words."" Adjectives and verbs, on the other hand, change much more rapidly. The first one to go extinct will be the adjective ""dirty,"" which will cease to be used to mean ""unclean"" in 750 years, Pagel said. Other candidates for extinction are the verbs to ""turn,"" ""push,"" stab,"" ""squeeze,"" and ""throw."" ""To push"" will likely go out of use in 850 years, Pagel said. That's because these words have a very high rate of change, according to the computer model. Try translating them into other Indo-European languages, and you come up with very different results. For instance, already there are 46 unrelated ways of saying ""dirty"" in the Indo-European languages, a clear signal that in English it will fall out of use relatively quickly.","Linguists: Pronouns are more resistant to change than verbs, nouns .

"Washington (CNN) -- After hinting for months that he would start a ""trusted traveler"" program to expedite screening at airport checkpoints, Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole took his first step in that direction Thursday, announcing a pilot project for passengers who voluntarily release certain information about themselves. The pilot project initially will be small, limited to a select group of travelers and to people already enrolled in existing programs run by border officials. Nonetheless, the travel industry and some politicians hailed it as a major change of philosophy that eventually could have a major impact on airport screening, diverting security from known individuals and focusing attention on unknown travelers and suspected terrorists. The TSA disclosed few details about the inner workings of the program. But industry officials briefed by the TSA said eligible participants will get to forgo some of the banalities of checkpoint searches -- such as removing shoes and jackets, and taking computers from carry-on bags. Participants also likely will be directed through magnetometers instead of through full-body imagers, which take more time and have raised privacy concerns, they said. The pilot project will begin this fall. ""These improvements will enable our officers to focus their efforts on higher risk areas,"" Pistole said. He called it a ""common sense step"" that will strengthen overall security. ""I think they're definitely headed in the right direction,"" said Stewart Verdery, former assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and partner in the Monument Policy Group. ""I think the time is right. With travel loads increasing and with budgetary pressures, they need to find a way to do more with less."" ""This is a signal from Administrator Pistole that he's not going to sit idly by and let the system be,"" said Geoff Freeman, executive vice president of U.S. Travel Association. ""We hope this is a first step to wholesale reform, and kudos to him for having the courage to do that. The pilot test initially will be available only to certain frequent fliers on American and Delta airlines -- flying out of certain airports. Delta passengers must be flying out of Atlanta and Detroit airports, and American Airlines passengers must be flying out of Miami and Dallas airports. It is also open to participants in Custom and Border Protection's Trusted Traveler programs, including Global Entry, SENTRI, and NEXUS. All participants must be U.S. citizens. The TSA said it plans to expand this pilot program to include United, Southwest, JetBlue, US Airways, Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian airlines, and additional airports, once operationally ready. Currently, the TSA vets passenger lists against ""watch lists"" of known or suspected terrorists. But the TSA is working with a very limited amount of information about those passengers -- namely a person's full name, date of birth and gender. Under ""trusted traveler"" programs, travelers voluntarily surrender more information about themselves, giving the government more assurances of who they are. The amount and nature of the information that will be sought was not disclosed. In recent years, there has been a drumbeat of calls for the TSA to adopt a trusted traveler program. Congress and critics have stepped up that demand following two highly publicized incidents, one involving the search of a 6-year-old girl, and the other involving a 95-year-old cancer patient. In both cases, the TSA has said the airport screeners were following established protocols. But the TSA also has said it is working toward a ""risk-based"" trusted traveler program that could expedite travel for people believed to present little risk to aviation. The TSA said Pistole will work with Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Alan Bersin and the airlines to determine passenger eligibility for this screening project, which is voluntary. All passengers in the pilot project will be subject to recurrent security checks. Verdery said that for the project to be successful, participants will want ""predictable"" wait times, and assurances that they will go through different screening. Travelers also will want their reviews based on their individual characteristics, and not solely their relationship with their airline, since many travelers use multiple carriers, Verdery said. Verdery and Freeman both said it is crucial that special lanes be devoted to the trusted travels to expedite their passage. Security experts have long expressed concern about so-called ""clean skins"" -- potential terrorists who enroll in ""trusted traveler"" programs to avoid scrutiny during a terror mission. But the TSA says it will continue to incorporate random and unpredictable security measures to address such concerns. Pistole said other layers of security will remain in place, including intelligence gathering and analysis, explosive-detection canine teams, federal air marshals, closed-circuit television monitoring and behavior detection officers.","TSA announces pilot program .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Sen. Ted Stevens repeatedly asked for invoices to cover home renovations and otherwise complied with Senate rules on accepting and reporting gifts of value, his defense attorney said in closing arguments Tuesday. Sen. Ted Stevens leaves the federal courthouse Tuesday evening with his daughter Beth Stevens. Stevens, 84, has been fighting a seven-count indictment accusing him of filing false statements on mandatory financial disclosure forms. The jury is scheduled to begin deliberating Wednesday. In closing arguments, prosecutors said Stevens engaged in an elaborate scheme to accept thousands of dollars in gifts from Alaskan oil industry executive Bill Allen, who has admitted he tried to bribe state legislators, including the senator's son. Stevens is not accused of bribery, but one prosecutor suggested he accepted gifts, concealed them from the public, and ""took care of Bill"" -- referring to Allen, the founder of oil services contractor Veco Corp. The trial has revolved around a construction project at the Stevens family chalet in Girdwood, Alaska, about 40 miles from Anchorage at the foot of a ski resort. Allen, starting in 2000, helped organize labor, materials and subcontractors that doubled the size of the home. In his closing arguments, defense attorney Brendan Sullivan said the government failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the jury should acquit Stevens on all counts. He noted Allen had testified that Stevens would have paid whatever bills were sent, but that he decided not to tell Stevens the full cost ""because I like Ted."" Allen also testified an Alaskan neighbor overseeing the home renovation said Stevens was ""just trying to cover his ass"" in requesting invoices for the project. Prosecutors have said none of the evidence shows Stevens ever paid Allen or Veco, and that neither is named on the disclosure forms. The neighbor, Bob Persons, testified during the trial that he never made that remark. On Tuesday, the defense highlighted the contradiction against the testimony of the prosecution's star witness, making it a theme throughout a series of correspondence in which Stevens continued to ask for a full accounting. ""If you're covering your ass,"" Sullivan told the jury, ""why, a month later, are you asking for the bill again?"" Prosecutors played a recorded phone call between Persons and Allen. ""Ted gets hysterical when he has to spend his own money,"" Bob Persons told a mutual friend in the recording, which was played for jurors by Joe Bottini, the assistant U.S. attorney for Alaska. Stevens, who spends most of his time in Washington, gave Persons power of attorney so he could get the required building permit to work on the chalet Stevens has owned since 1983. Persons also confided to Allen that he didn't believe Stevens had enough money to do the remodeling. Later Tuesday, the government made its final case. ""Wow!"" shouted prosecutor Brenda Morris as she stood to address the jury, ""Were we at the same trial? Because the evidence I saw was totally different."" She urged the jury to find the senator guilty on all counts, saying the evidence shows ""Ted Stevens knowingly and repeatedly violated the law because he thought he was above the law."" The judge will remind the jury that Allen's testimony against Stevens is part of a deal with prosecutors that could reduce his jail time when sentenced for attempted bribery. Morris, the lead prosecutor in the Stevens case, tried to bolster Allen's standing as the jury prepared to deliberate. ""The only thing he's guilty of with regard to this defendant is standing up and telling the truth"" about materials and labor he arranged on the home improvement project, Morris said of Allen. ""It was the defendant who is responsible for reporting it."" If convicted on all counts, Stevens would face a maximum sentence of 35 years. Legal experts note the judge has the discretion to give Stevens as little as no jail time and probation. Former federal prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers have told CNN that if convicted on some or all of the counts, the senator probably would face between a year to more than two years in jail.","NEW: Prosecutor rebuttal: ""The evidence I saw was totally different""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- More Mainland Chinese travelers are jet-setting to foreign shores and global luxury brands are cashing in, according to a new survey by KPMG, the global auditing firm. The report also revealed that rising Chinese incomes are fueling demand for luxury goods right at home in the domestic market. The findings from KPMG's ""The Global Reach of China Luxury"" echo reports over the past several months that show Chinese consumers are able -- and willing -- to pay more. An HSBC report in September estimated that 25% of the world's luxury purchases were made by Chinese nationals -- a jump up from a 5% market share in 2007. The global management firm McKinsey & Co. reported in December that Chinese consumers had become the prime engine of growth for the luxury sector, surpassing Japan, which had long been the world's largest. By 2015, McKinsey & Co. predicted China's luxury market would account for one-fifth of global sales with a value of $27 billion. The number of Mainland Chinese consumers polled who traveled overseas in 2012 climbed to 71% -- a ""significant change"" from 53% in 2008, the KPMG report said. Of those travelers, 72% said they bought more high-end products such as handbags, cosmetics and watches. This rising tide of Mainland Chinese travelers means that global luxury brands need to take another look at their business strategies in order to take advantage, said Nick Debnam, KPMG China's Asia Pacific Chairman of Consumer Markets. ""It is no longer just about doing business in China... brands need to therefore align their branding and marketing strategies both in China, and for those rising number of travelling Chinese consumers,"" Debnam said in the report. A majority of respondents -- 60% -- said Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau were their favorite places to go to pocket perfumes and cosmetics. One-fifth of respondents said they went to Europe in 2012, up from 3% in 2009. Mainland Chinese are also recognizing more global brand names -- 59 in 2012 compared to 34 in 2006 -- and have attached specific sentiments to products based on their country of origin. Most respondents -- 89% -- ascribed ""romantic"" feelings to French products, while 72% said German products were known for being ""precise."" Four out of five respondents linked the idea of ""long history"" to Mainland Chinese goods; just 15% attached the same sentiment to U.S.-manufactured items. The KPMG report noted that ""China is not without its challenges"" but despite the global economic slowdown the country's ""consumer sector continues to grow and also accounts for an increasing share of global sales for some of the world's largest luxury brands.""","More Mainland Chinese are traveling overseas, buying luxury brands, says KPMG .

"(CNN) -- Ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte will fall soon, perhaps within days, commanders of the anti-Gadhafi operation told U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Friday, according to a senior U.S. defense official traveling with him. Panetta met during the morning with the commanders at the naval base that hosts the U.S. Sixth Fleet in Italy, the official said. The commanders said they have no reason to believe Gadhafi can exercise command and control of those militia members who remain loyal to him, the official said. They further believe that, although the anti-Gadhafi forces are gaining the ability to exercise control, they will likely need training to develop their capabilities, the official said. Still, no timetable has been drawn up for when commanders will recommend that NATO forces end their involvement, the official said. The fall of Sirte could not come soon enough for Libya's new leaders, eager to declare liberation once the birthplace of Gadhafi is under their control. But battles for the coastal city southeast of Tripoli have raged for weeks as Gadhafi loyalists dug in to put up stiff resistance. Complicating the matter was the resignation Friday of Mahdi al-Harati, the deputy head of the Tripoli Military Council, a senior National Transitional Council official said. ""He resigned due to differences with the NTC on the planning of the security of Tripoli. We are the official governing body and the efforts of the revolutionaries that fought for the liberation are appreciated but the command must be centralized,"" Mohamed Sayeh told CNN. He said NTC officials were trying to get that message across ""in a democratic, brotherly manner."" Al-Harati will continue as commander of the Tripoli brigades, said Fathi al-Wersali, a senior member of the Tripoli Military Council. ""There is overlapping in the role of the Tripoli military council and the NTC,"" he said. ""A clear mechanism has not been finalized, which leaves us not clear on how to move forward in securing Tripoli."" Early Friday, hundreds of revolutionary fighters attacked from the west, NTC military field commanders said. Gadhafi's men control tall buildings in the city center, where they fire on their foes from rooftops. They were striking with rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns, said the council's commanders, Mohammed Ibrahim and Jamal al-Raeis, from the front lines. At least 12 revolutionary fighters were killed and 193 others wounded Friday, the Misrata Military Council said. ""The battle will be difficult, but we have to finish it,"" Ibrahim said. The International Committee of the Red Cross evacuated three wounded people from Ibn Sina hospital in Sirte to a field hospital on Thursday. Dibeh Fakhr, an ICRC spokesman in Misrata, said Friday that the group is committed to re-entering Sirte to evacuate more casualties. The Red Cross said thousands of civilians remain inside Sirte and waves of war-weary civilians were streaming from the coastal city every day. ""We even saw entire families leaving on foot, bringing their small children with them, without any food or water,"" Red Cross delegate Ghafar Bishtawi said. More than 18,000 people, including many women, children and elderly people, are displaced east of Sirte and hundreds have moved to safer locations west of the city, the Red Cross said. Sirte is one of two contested cities remaining in Libya as the National Transitional Council moves forward to form new governance in the country. The council's leader and the interim prime minister have promised to step down to clear the way for a new government once Sirte is taken. Gadhafi, wanted by the International Criminal Court in the Hague for alleged crimes against humanity, has not been seen in public in months. Syrian-based television aired an audio message Thursday that was purportedly from the deposed leader. In it, the speaker urged Libyans to protest the new leadership. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","Deputy head of Tripoli Military Council resigns .

"Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- Friends and family gathered Sunday for an emotional prayer vigil for a missing 11-month-old Missouri girl as new surveillance video surfaced from the night Lisa Irwin disappeared. The video, taken from a BP gas station less than two miles from the home where Lisa was last seen, shows an unidentified person walking along the road around 2:15 a.m. October 4. The station manager, Anuj Arora, said it's unusual to see anyone walking at that time of night in the region. Arora, who shared the video with CNN on Sunday, said he also turned it over to authorities investigating Lisa's disappearance in hopes it will help in the search for the girl. The FBI and Kansas City police declined to comment on the video, citing the ongoing investigation. Meanwhile Sunday, Lisa's parents, Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin, were seen wiping away tears at the candlelight vigil outside their home. They wore T-shirts emblazoned with Lisa's image. Lisa was reported missing at 4 a.m. October 4, after Jeremy Irwin came home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and a window that had been tampered with. Bradley said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before. A cadaver dog searching the family's home indicated a positive ""hit"" for the scent of a body, according to documents released Friday. The information was included in an affidavit, dated Tuesday, police filed to request a search warrant of the home. The warrant was executed Wednesday. ""The cadaver dog indicated a positive 'hit' for the scent of a deceased human in the area of the floor of Bradley's bedroom near the bed,"" the affidavit read. It also said that interviews with people involved in the case ""revealed conflicting information"" and that Bradley told police she did not initially look for her baby behind the house because she ""was afraid of what she might find."" The attorney for Lisa's parents said the release of the affidavit Friday was ""unfortunate,"" as it could derail the search for the missing girl. Joe Tacopina described his clients as ""very shaken up and they refuse to believe anything except that she is out there and alive."" He said Lisa's parents are ""terrified, not for themselves, but for the welfare of their daughter."" Bradley said in an NBC interview last week that she was drunk the night the infant disappeared and that she had last seen the baby about four hours earlier than initially reported. Bradley told NBC she is afraid she will be arrested. Police have accused her of killing Lisa, she said, and told her that she failed a lie detector test. ""I was the last one with her,"" a tearful Bradley said. ""And from judging on how the questioning went, that's kind of a fear that I have. And the main fear with that is, if they arrest me, people are going to stop looking for her. And then I'll never see her again, and I'll never know what happened."" Asked whether he had questions about Bradley, Jeremy Irwin told NBC, ""No. There's no question to be had there. I know who she is. I know the kind of mother she is."" Irwin said it's possible someone could have entered the house without Bradley hearing, as the couple's bedroom is on the opposite corner of the house from Lisa's room and Bradley sleeps with a fan at high speed. Lisa is described as being 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blonde hair, according to police. She weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it. The missing girl has two bottom teeth and a ""beauty mark"" on her right outer thigh, police said. At the time of her disappearance, she had a cold with a cough. CNN's Sandra Endo and Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.","Gas station video shows unidentified person walking in the early morning hours of October 4 .

"(CNN) -- The racing sanctioning body IndyCar held a public memorial service, punctuated by laughter and tears, Sunday to celebrate the life of two-time Indianapolis 500 champ Dan Wheldon. Those at the memorial, held at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, recalled Wheldon not only as a successful driver, but remembered his winning charm, his sense of humor, and his devotion to his family and his fans. Wheldon, 33, was near the back of a 34-car field at the Las Vegas Indy 300 on October 16 when he got mixed up in a crash that saw several cars spin out of control and burst into flames, spewing smoke and debris. He died of head injuries. ""The victories and the accolades, they didn't define him,"" said IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard. ""His strong character, his enthusiastic approach to life, and the love of family, friends and fans did. ""There was a reason he was a fan favorite,"" Bernard said. ""I'd see him go out of his way to shake a serviceman's hand, or sign a young man's autograph, or do that extra interview, or just joke around with the drivers. Dan loved life and it always showed."" Featured on stage beside the speakers Sunday was a car Bernard said Wheldon had been testing. It had ""cutting-edge enhancements that promised to move the sport of racing and automotive engineering forward."" It also had additional safety features, testament to Wheldon's commitment to improving the sport and increasing safety for drivers, he said. ""He would want the drivers and the teams and the series to unite and to work together,"" Bernard said. ""He'd want us to strive to make our sport safer."" The memorial featured music from country artists Reba McEntire and The Band Perry. Wheldon's family was in attendance. ""It was a privilege for us to witness a young, carefree racer blossom into a true champion and a devoted family man,"" said one of Wheldon's managers, Mickey Ryan. He recalled Wheldon partying all night after his first Indianapolis 500 win in 2005, then falling asleep while on hold waiting for an early morning radio interview. After his second win in 2011, he pledged to take his children to a Disney park, and dedicated the win to his mother, who was battling Alzheimer's disease, Ryan and manager Adrian Sussman said. The two issued a message of gratitude from Wheldon's family. ""They'd like you to know how much they appreciate the amazing outpouring of sympathy, flowers, gifts and notes of condolences,"" Sussman said. ""It's been a great comfort for them to know that there are so many others that share in their grief."" Despite the somber event, speakers recalled many humorous moments, recalling Wheldon's penchant for practical jokes, his compulsive neatness and his liking for tight racing suits. Drivers Brian Herta, Tony Kanaan and Dario Franchitti -- Wheldon's former teammates -- recalled messing Wheldon's locker up on purpose once and then waiting for him before a run, as he could not come out and drive unless the locker was straightened. ""He made us look like pigs,"" Herta said. They also recalled entering Wheldon's hotel room in Japan once, stealing one of each of his shoes and sending them back to America, along with taking his television and some of his hair products. Herta said he was not saying goodbye to Wheldon. ""Goodbye is final,"" he said. ""Our friendship won't end."" On Saturday, hundreds gathered in St. Petersburg, Florida, for Wheldon's funeral. Born in Emberton, England, Wheldon had settled in the west Florida city with his wife and two young sons. Susie Wheldon spoke to her late husband through a letter read aloud by family friend Michael Johnson at the First Presbyterian Church. Audio from that message, and other parts of Saturday's otherwise private ceremony, were recorded and released by CNN affiliate WTSP. ""I am so scared.

"Editor's note: Canadian writer Margaret Atwood is the author of more than 35 books of poetry, fiction and nonfiction. Her novels include ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and ""The Blind Assassin,"" which won the Booker Prize in 2000. Her new book, published this week by House of Anansi Press, is ""Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth."" Atwood says the book ""is not a practical guide about how to get out of debt. Instead it examines the underpinnings of the whole structure -- why we human beings have such a thing as a debt-credit system in the first place."" Margaret Atwood says we've come to feel that debt is essential to our lives. (CNN) -- Unless we value fairness, reciprocity, and honest dealing, and the concept of balances -- for debt and credit depend on them -- and unless we are able to trust our systems, we would not be able to have debt and credit -- no one would lend, because there would be no expectation of ever getting paid back. What caused the massive financial mess we are in comes back ultimately to these concepts. The rules were too loose, fairness and honest dealing were violated, the balance was upset. We must now restore trust so people will take their pennies out of the sock under the mattress where they are now inclined to store them. In my part of the world we have a ritual interchange that goes like this: . First person: ""Lovely weather we're having."" Second person: ""We'll pay for it later."" My part of the world being Canada, where there is a great deal of weather, we always do pay for it later. One person has commented, ""That's not Canadian, it's just Presbyterian."" Nevertheless, it's a widespread saying among us. What this ritual interchange reveals is a larger habit of thinking about the more enjoyable things in life: They're only on loan or acquired on credit, and sooner or later the date when they must be paid for will roll around. It's pay-up time. Or payback time, supposing that you haven't paid up. In any case, the time when whatever is on one side of the balance is weighed against whatever is on the other side -- whether it's your heart, your soul or your debts -- and the final reckoning is made. The financial world has recently been shaken as a result of the collapse of a debt pyramid involving something called ""subprime mortgages"" -- a pyramid scheme that most people don't grasp very well, but that boils down to the fact that some large financial institutions peddled mortgages to people who could not possibly pay the monthly rates and then put this snake-oil debt into cardboard boxes with impressive labels on them and sold them to institutions and hedge funds that thought they were worth something. A friend of mine from the United States writes: ""I used to have three banks and a mortgage company. Bank number one bought the other two and is now trying hard to buy the mortgage company, which is bankrupt, only it was revealed this morning that the last bank standing is also in serious trouble. ""Now they are trying to renegotiate with the mortgage company. Question One: If your company is going broke, why would you want to buy a company whose insolvency is front-page news? Question Two: If all the lenders go broke, will the borrowers get off the hook? ""You can't imagine the chagrin of the credit-loving American. I gather that whole neighborhoods in the Midwest look like neighborhoods in my hometown, empty houses with knee-high grass and vines growing over them and no one willing to admit they actually own the place. Down we go, about to reap what we sow."" Which has a nice biblical ring to it, but still we scratch our heads. How and why did this happen? The answer I hear quite often -- ""greed"" -- may be accurate enough, but it doesn't go very far toward unveiling the deeper mysteries of the process. What is this ""debt"" by which we're so bedeviled? Like air, it's all around us, but we never think about it unless something goes wrong with the supply. Certainly it's a thing we've come to feel is indispensable to our collective buoyancy. In good times we float around on it as if on a helium-filled balloon; we rise higher and higher, and the balloon gets bigger and bigger, until -- poof! -- some killjoy sticks a pin into it and we sink. But what is the nature of that pin? Another friend of mine used to maintain that airplanes stayed up in the air only because people believed -- against reason -- that they could fly: Without that collective delusion sustaining them, they would instantly plummet to earth. Is ""debt"" similar? In other words, perhaps debt exists because we imagine it. Another part of the human imaginative debt/credit structure has to do with payback time -- the time when you have to pay the debt back, or else suffer the consequences. All major religions have extended this structure to the afterlife, where, if you haven't righted the moral balances on earth, you must do so after death. There are no clocks in heaven. Nor are there any in hell. In both, everything is always now. Or so goes the rumor. In heaven, there are no debts -- all have been paid, one way or another -- but in hell there's nothing but debts, and a great deal of payment is exacted, though you can't ever get all paid up. You have to pay, and pay, and keep on paying. Hell is like an infernal maxed-out credit card that multiplies the charges endlessly. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Margaret Atwood: Rules of fair dealing were violated in the growth of debt .

"(CNN) -- Carol Mackoff and her family were rescued Friday morning after being trapped in their rooms in the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai for more than 48 hours. A text message from CNN correspondent Sara Sidner to Mackoff, who was in contact with CNN during the attack. ""They informed us the final assault was beginning and we got a call from the colonel of the [Indian] army, and he said we will give you a password and if we come to the door and give it to you, come quietly with us,"" Mackoff said. ""That's exactly what happened."" Upon arrival, the Indian army rescued six people at a time, Mackoff said. ""It was only what we could carry,"" she said. ""They took us down a back service stairway that was very quiet. We were tiptoeing through glass and blood and discarded shoes from people who it appeared had recently died."" Mackoff, her husband, sister and friend were on a three-week trip to India. ""In the beginning, we heard shots and we didn't know what was happening,"" she told CNN by phone. ""We saw men running down our hallway and we could see through the peephole in the door -- we could see guns in their hands."" Mackoff said they received a call from hotel staffers telling them to stay away from the door and lock it. For 20 hours they sat in the dark. At one point they taped the peephole so nobody could see in. The Chicago, Illinois, resident said the attackers rang their doorbell twice, but she and her family didn't answer.  Listen to Mackoff describe what it was like inside the hotel » . ""We locked every possible lock on the door and put heavy suitcases against it,"" she said. ""When the explosions started and smoke filled the hallways we put towels at the bottom of the door."" She said she was told that attackers opened doors across the hallway and had thrown grenades inside. ""All we were thinking was 'Please don't try and blow this door open,'"" Mackoff said. Mackoff said because of the hotel wing's large atrium, which reaches from the bottom floor to the top floor, the sounds of gunshots and explosions echoed and reverberated throughout the two days. She said looking through the peephole she could see that most of the attackers were carrying backpacks. ""They were young and they all seemed to have the same kind of jackets and red and blue backpacks, that we were told officials believed were stuffed with grenades or some sort of explosives,"" she told CNN. ""We were able to see the barrel of their gun and at one point one of them had a cell phone and was conversing or coordinating with someone."" While she was trapped, Mackoff exchanged text messages with the U.S. Consulate, which coordinated the rescue with the Indian Army. The four were told the exact time they would be rescued. Mackoff also kept in contact with CNN, including correspondent Sara Sidner, who was reporting from outside the Taj Mahal Hotel.

A CNN staff member ""kept me filled in on what was going on and I kept her filled in on what was going on -- on what I could hear,"" Mackoff said. Those contacts were Mackoff's only lifeline to the outside. She said the satellite connection had been cut, so they couldn't watch TV to see what was going on. Throughout the 48 hours they were trapped, Mackoff and her companions ate chocolate chip cookies from the minibar, health bars they had brought from home and cashew nuts. Finally, when Mackoff and her family and friend were rescued, she sent a message to CNN to say she was safe. ""It doesn't seem real.

"(CNN) -- Chemical testing of air samples from the trunk of Casey Anthony's car primarily showed the presence of gasoline, jurors in Anthony's capital murder trial heard Wednesday. Other compounds, including chloroform, were also found, but the amount did not appear to be large, University of Central Florida chemist Michael Sigman told jurors in the Orlando courtroom. Testing was not done to determine the amounts, Sigman said, but ""they gave very low responses in the instrument."" While some of the compounds found are associated with human decomposition, Sigman told defense attorney J. Cheney Mason, he cannot definitively say that their presence indicated a decomposing body was in the trunk, because there are other natural sources for those compounds as well. Sigman took the air samples from the trunk, one of which was sent to Arpad Vass at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Earlier in the trial, Vass testified that testing on a carpet sample from the trunk showed chloroform at a level that was ""shockingly high."" He also testified the odor in the air samples he received was ""extremely overwhelming."" He identified it as human decomposition. Casey Anthony, 25, is charged with seven counts in her daughter's death, including first-degree murder. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. Prosecutors allege Anthony used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious, then used duct tape to cover her nose and mouth, suffocating her. Caylee's remains, prosecutors allege, were then put into Anthony's car trunk and eventually disposed of. The girl's skeletal remains were found in a wooded field on December 11, 2008, nearly six months after her family last reported having seen the child. Defense attorneys say Caylee was not murdered, but that she accidentally drowned in the family pool on June 16, 2008, the day she was last reported to have been seen. They argue that Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked and covered up the death. George Anthony has rejected that scenario in his testimony. Caylee was not reported missing to police until July 15, 2008, when Casey Anthony's mother, Cindy, tracked down her daughter and demanded answers regarding Caylee's whereabouts. Sigman was one of a handful of forensic experts testifying Wednesday as Anthony's defense continued presenting its case. Jurors also heard from FBI geologist forensic examiner Maureen Bottrell, who analyzed a number of items in the case for soil samples, including 22 pairs of shoes from the Anthony home. Only three pairs had some material for comparison, she told defense attorney Jose Baez, and soil on them did not match that at the site where Caylee's remains were recovered. However, she acknowledged on cross-examination that does not mean she can say for sure the shoes were never there, as soil can fall off or material from several locations can cloud testing results. Also, FBI forensic toxicologist Madeline Montgomery told jurors she tested the ""hair mass"" found with the child's remains for the presence of 11 drugs, including Xanax, Valium and ketamine. The results were all negative, she said. The FBI lab does not test hair for the presence of chloroform, she said. FBI forensic chemist Michael Rickenbach was recalled to the stand, where he testified that testing showed no chloroform was found on Caylee's car seat, in the interior of Anthony's car or the steering wheel cover in the car. Testing on a liquid found in a syringe, discovered inside a plastic bottle near Caylee's remains, showed testosterone compounds but no significant amount of chloroform, he said. FBI trace evidence examiner Karen Lowe, also recalled to the stand, said that of ""hundreds"" of hairs she examined in the case, from the Anthony home, Anthony's vehicle and Anthony's clothing, she only found one that showed evidence of decomposition. But, she told prosecutor Jeff Ashton, that one came from Anthony's trunk -- the subject of her previous testimony. Under questioning from Ashton, Montgomery said that sometimes drugs do not show up in hair and that a person still could have been given drugs with negative hair testing results. On Tuesday, prosecutors told Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. they are looking into information regarding a woman who at one point was incarcerated with Anthony, and whose child died in a way similar to how Anthony's defense says Caylee died. The matter was mentioned in a conversation regarding discovery items provided to the defense. April Whalen's child died in a pool, and the child's grandfather discovered the body, prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick told Perry. Whalen says she never spoke with Anthony, but did not know whether Anthony may have talked to other inmates, Burdick said. ""It's being explored whether there was indirect contact,"" she said. The information came from someone who called the Orange County Sheriff's Office last week, suggesting the two could have been in contact, Burdick said. In response to a question from Perry, Burdick said she does not currently plan for Whalen to testify, but the information could become relevant. Whalen told CNN's sister network HLN she never met Anthony during the few days she was in jail for driving with a suspended license and that she has nothing to do with the case. According to the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, Whalen's 15-month-old son, Isaiah Whalen, drowned in a backyard pool on Christmas Day 2007. After finding him in the pool, the boy's grandfather performed CPR and called 911, Burdick said in court Tuesday. Allen Moore, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Office, said Whalen was in the same dormitory as Anthony for five days, from June 4 through June 8, 2009. There are no jail records, investigations or reports that indicate any contact occurred between the two, he said. A Dutch forensic scientist testified Tuesday that given even a small amount of DNA, it would be possible to extract a DNA profile from the duct tape covering the mouth portion of Caylee's skeletal remains. But DNA expert Richard Eikelenboom testified that he did not ask to test the duct tape, although he said he offered to investigate. Eikelenboom testified about ""low copy number"" DNA, a technique by which small samples of DNA are amplified and copied in an effort to obtain a full profile. He said that when tape is used to cover a person's mouth, it is possible the sticky side of the tape could contain skin cells from the face as well as DNA from the mouth. However, he told Ashton, factors such as heat and water have ""a very detrimental effect"" on DNA and it would be difficult to determine a profile from tape that, as in this case, had been exposed to the elements for as long as six months. An FBI examiner previously testified that DNA testing on the tape was inconclusive, but a possible indication of DNA there did not appear to match that of Caylee, Casey Anthony or George Anthony. Also Tuesday, Marcus Wise, an analytical chemist from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, testified that, while testing on carpet from Anthony's car trunk showed the presence of chloroform, a test to determine how much chloroform was present would have been meaningless, as chloroform is a ""volatile chemical"" that evaporates, much like gasoline, . Asked what effect a closed trunk would have on that, Wise said it would not slow the chemical's volatility but might make it more difficult for the chemical to escape the trunk. Wise told Ashton on Tuesday that the ""relative abundance"" of chloroform was ""very unusual to me."" Earlier Tuesday, a forensic botanist testified Caylee's remains could have been at the site where they were found -- less than a mile from her grandparents' home -- for as little as two weeks, based on plant evidence found there. ""I don't know exactly when"" the remains were placed there, Jane Bock said. ""My best guess is what I have presented today."" Ashton introduced into evidence a photo of Caylee's skull, showing leaf matter and debris that had accumulated up to the lower portion of the eye sockets. He asked Bock if that could have occurred in two weeks. ""If these leaves are, in fact, the level that has fallen since the skull has been there, then clearly the skull has been there for a lot longer than two weeks, wouldn't you agree?"" Ashton asked. ""Given your hypothesis that it had lain there undisturbed all that time, the answer would be yes,"" Bock acknowledged. She told Ashton she could not say for sure if it was possible the skull could have sunk into the leaf litter. As the photo of the skull was shown in the courtroom, Anthony looked downward with her mouth pressed to the back of her hand. Bock also told jurors Tuesday that fragments found on and in Anthony's car did not match the vegetation at the scene where the remains were found. The trial entered its fifth week Monday. Perry told jurors that the trial will go only until about noon Wednesday, adding that he has a meeting at 1 p.m. concerning state trial court budgeting. He said the court day on Saturday will be extended to make up the time. In Session's Mayra Cuevas, Michael Christian and Grace Wong and HLN's Selin Darkalstanian contributed to this report.

"Paris (CNN) -- Since the revelation on the front page of daily newspaper Libération, on December 11, with a particularly vicious editorial talking about France's national treasure as a ""former genius actor,"" Gérard Depardieu's departure to Belgium, where he bought a property just a mile from the French border, has deeply divided and saddened France. Even more so since, as we have learnt this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin has bestowed the actor Russian citizenship. Read more: Depardieu's puzzling love for Russia . Back in mid-December, the French media operated along political lines: the left-wing press such as Libération couldn't find strong enough words to describe Depardieu's ""desertion"" while right-wing publications such as Le Figaro, slightly uneasy at the news, preferred to focus on President François Hollande's punishing taxes which allegedly drove throngs of millionaires to seek tax asylum in more fiscally lenient countries such as Belgium or Britain. Le Figaro stopped short of passing moral judgement though. Others like satirical weekly Charlie hebdo, preferred irony. Its cover featured a cartoon of the rather rotund-looking Depardieu in front of a Belgian flag with the headline: ""Can Belgium take the world's entire load of cholesterol?"" Ouch. Quickly though, it became quite clear that Depardieu was not treated in the same way as other famous French tax exiles. French actor Alain Delon is a Swiss resident as is crooner-rocker Johnny Halliday, and many other French stars and sportsmen ensure they reside for under six months in France in order to escape being taxed here on their income and capital. Their move has hardly ever been commented on. And they certainly never had to suffer the same infamy. Read more: Actor Depardieu makes Russia trip after accepting citizenship . For Depardieu, a public war of words erupted. It started with the French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, and many members of his government, showing their disdain, and talking of Depardieu's ""pathetic move."" In response the outraged actor penned an open letter to the French PM in which he threatened to give back his French passport. The backlash was not over. Fellow thespian Phillipe Torreton fired the first salvo against Depardieu in an open letter published in Libération, insulting both Depardieu's protruding physique and lack of patriotism: ""So you're leaving the ship France in the middle of a storm? What did you expect, Gérard? You thought we would approve? You expected a medal, an academy award from the economy ministry? (...)We'll get by without you."" French actress Catherine Deneuve felt she had to step in to defend Depardieu. In another open letter published by Libération, she evoked the darkest hours of the French revolution. Before flying to Rome to celebrate the New Year, Depardieu gave an interview to Le Monde in which he seemed to be joking about having asked Putin for Russian citizenship. Except, it wasn't a joke. Read more: French star Depardieu ditches France for Putin's Russia . In truth, French people have felt touched to their core by Depardieu's gesture. He, more than anyone, represents the Gallic spirit. He has been Cyrano, he has been Danton; he, better than most, on screen and off, stands for what it means to be French: passionate, sensitive, theatrical, and grandiose. Ambiguous too, and weak in front of temptations and pleasures. For more than two weeks now, #Depardieu has been trending on French Twitter. Surveys have showed France's dilemma: half the French people understand him but there are as many who think that paying one's taxes is a national duty. In other words, a majority of French people disapprove of his action but can't help loving the man. Read more: Paris promises flurry of economic reforms . Putin's move in granting the actor Russian citizenship has exacerbated things. And first of all, it is a blow to Hollande who, it was revealed, had a phone conversation with Depardieu on New Year's Day. The Elysées Palace refused to communicate on the men's exchange. A friend of the actor declared that Depardieu complained about being so reviled by the press and that he was leaving, no matter what. If, in their hearts, the French don't quite believe Depardieu might one day settle in Moscow and abandon them, they feel deeply saddened by the whole saga. However, with France's former sex symbol Brigitte Bardot declaring that she too might ask Putin for Russian citizenship to protest against the fate of zoo elephants in Lyon, it looks as if the French may prefer to laugh the whole thing off. Proof of this: the last trend on French Twitter is #IWantRussianCitizenship. Read more: Brigitte Bardot threatens to spurn France, embrace Russia if 2 elephants killed .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A fourth person was arrested in in the case of four mentally disabled people who were found locked in the boiler room of a Philadelphia apartment building over the weekend, police said Wednesday. The daughter of Linda Ann Weston, 51, who previously was arrested in the case, was brought in for questioning Tuesday night and was arrested early Wednesday, said Philadelphia police spokesman Officer Christine O'Brien. The woman, whose name was not given, likely will face the same charges as her mother and two other suspects, which include criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, kidnapping, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment, O'Brien said. More information will be released later Wednesday, she said. No bail had been set. On Tuesday, Philadelphia police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said a woman rescued from the boiler room claims she had two children while being held against her will, and that authorities have located 10 other potential victims. The four people, three men and a woman ranging in age from 29 to 41, were found locked in the room with no food and only a bucket for a toilet, police said. The pitch-black, 15-foot-by-6-foot space houses what police described as a boiler used to heat the building. A penetrating stench of urine and feces still hung in the chamber days after the discovery. One of the four, identified as Derwin McLemire, had been chained to the boiler, police said. While police have not released the names of the four alleged victims, they confirmed the accuracy of media reports identifying them as McLemire, Herbert Knowles, Edwin Sanabria and Tamara Breeden. Weston; Gregory Thomas, 47; and Eddie Wright, 49, were previously arrested. Authorities were investigating whether the victims' Social Security checks had been stolen, as well as several other leads. Six of the 10 new alleged victims are children, Ramsey said. Two of them, ages 2 and 5, are believed to be the children born to Breeden, police said. Authorities did not divulge how Breeden became pregnant. Another is a 19-year-old niece of Weston, Ramsey said. ""The 19-year-old has visible injuries, she may have been beaten, and she has scars all over her body,"" Ramsey said. Breeden said while she was with Weston, ""she says she gave birth to two children and we have no reason to doubt it,"" he said. Weston had identification documents for about 50 people with her when she was arrested, Ramsey said. They included Social Security cards and court documents giving power of attorney, among others. Ramsey said police must track down all of those individuals and find out what happened to them and whether they were victims. It is possible that Weston has been involved in similar activity dating back to the late 1990s, he said. ""We don't know the extent of this,"" Ramsey told CNN Tuesday. ""We do know it goes beyond the borders of Pennsylvania -- at least Texas, Florida and Virginia, and we suspect other locations as well."" Three of the four alleged victims spoke to the media about their harrowing experience on Monday. ""That was real dirty of you. That was wrong,"" a tearful McLemire told CNN affiliate KYW , talking about his alleged captors. The alleged victims said they were beaten and were afraid of the suspects in the case. Breeden told KYW Weston hit her in the head, ""and all this was bleeding and everything."" McLemire, Breeden and a third man, Herbert Knowles, told KYW their Social Security information was taken from them. McLemire, who said he is from North Carolina, said he met Weston on an online dating site, according to KYW. He said once he attempted to escape from a home of Weston's, ""and I didn't get away, so they got me."" Bond for each of the three suspects was set at $2.5 million, according to the Philadelphia district attorney's office. The FBI joined the probe after detectives discovered one of the accused had traveled to at least two other states with the people found in the basement of the northeast Philadelphia apartment building, police spokesman Evers said. Weston served eight years in prison for killing her sister's boyfriend in the early 1980s, Ramsey said earlier. In that case, the victim ""was held captive for an extended period of time, locked in a closet and he literally starved to death,"" he said. ""That concerns us because obviously, she's capable of quite a bit of a lot of different things,"" he said. Asked why Weston is not still behind bars, Ramsey said Tuesday, ""That's a good question. Our legal system is what it is, but you would think that someone who's committed a crime that horrific would still be in jail. But she wasn't, and obviously she wasn't fully rehabilitated, either."" Ramsey said he has a team of detectives working the case, and is likely to put a task force together for long-term investigation, because ""this is not one that's going to end very quickly."" Weston is believed to have been in McLean, Texas, with some or all of the alleged captives. They then traveled to Florida and Philadelphia, Evers said. All seven had been traveling together, he said, but he did not know for how long. A preliminary hearing for the suspects on the charges and evidence in the Philadelphia case was set for October 24. No pleas were entered on Monday, with that to happen at a formal arraignment at a date yet to be set. CNN's Melanie Whitley, Tom Faust, Ross Levitt and Kyra Phillips contributed to this report.","NEW: The arrested woman is the daughter of suspect Linda Ann Weston .

"San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- More than 600 officers from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and local police departments conducted a raid on the largest public housing complex in Puerto Rico Thursday in an operation against its biggest drug gang. Arrest warrants were issued for 82 alleged members of the Calle Cuatro, or Fourth Street, gang, blamed for 25 murders on the island. According to officials, 43 alleged gang members had been arrested by Thursday afternoon. A federal indictment says the 82 suspects are wanted on drug or weapons charges, or both. The defendants are accused of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, ""crack"" (cocaine base), heroin, marijuana and oxycodone, according to the U.S. attorney's office in San Juan. Starting early Thursday, agents poured into the Luis Llorens Torres complex, a public housing neighborhood comprising 140 buildings housing about 2,500 families. Federal officials said the co-conspirators used apartments and other locations to cook, store and sell the drugs. The Calle Cuatro is known as the most organized, most violent, and biggest of the gangs operating in the complex, authorities said. The Puerto Rico Police Department and the San Juan Police Department also participated in the raid.","NEW: The suspects are accused of selling cocaine, marijuana, heroin and oxycodone .

"London (CNN) -- Why was the euro created? The euro, which created the world's largest trading power, was designed to link together the European nations for trade and political purposes. It was born amid political and economic upheaval as Germany headed towards reunification -- with the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 -- and communism disintegrated in Eastern Europe. The European Union was put in place after World War II, but as the economic winds shifted the drive to create a single economic and political bloc intensified. The Treaty on European Union, known as the Treaty of Maastricht, was signed in the Dutch city of Maastricht on February 7, 1992, before entering into force in 1993. It created the structure for a single currency, later named the euro, to be born. The currency's symbol was inspired by the Greek letter epsilon, with the notes and coins available by 2001. They were issued by the European Central Bank, which was based in Frankfurt to placate Germany's loss of its beloved Deutschmark. But now the European dream -- which has the euro at its center -- has been hobbled. Eurozone members, led by Germany, are being forced to bail out the weaker economies in a financial crisis which is threatening the entire existence of the bloc. How does the euro work? Creating a currency which could be used across such disparate economies was always a difficult task. The idea for a single currency was promoted by Jacques Delors, a former French minister of finance, who held the European Commission presidency from 1985 to 1995. The aim was to stamp a European identity in the markets, bringing, among other things, price stability, growth and trading benefits. The Delors report of 1989 defined a monetary union objective as being, in part, a ""complete liberalization of capital movements."" The final structure was a bloc in which political and fiscal integration was minimal; The euro was not designed to create a 'United States' of Europe. Instead the Maastricht Treaty created specific conditions for entry into the single currency. Among other criteria, member countries must not allow annual budget deficits to exceed 3% of gross domestic product, and public debt must be under 60%. The bloc's monetary policy was to be controlled by the European Central Bank, which had a remit of setting interest rates and controlling inflation around 2% or below. However, each country would retain its own tax policies, budgets and banks and issue their own bonds -- with prices varying depending on the risks investors associated with each country. Who belongs to the eurozone? Of the 27 countries in the European Union, 17 nations -- comprising almost 332 million people -- use the euro as their currency. The eurozone's biggest economy is Germany, followed by France. The weaker economies are Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain, a group which gained the unwanted acronym PIIGS as the crisis unfolded. Other members are Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia with the most recent edition, Estonia, joining in January this year. Sweden does not belong to the eurozone but is obligated to do so in the future, according to the terms of the treaty. Those who don't qualify for the euro, even though they are members of the EU, are Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania. In 2000 Denmark rejected the adoption of the euro in a referendum, while the UK also stayed out. Why didn't the UK want to belong to the eurozone? Debate over joining the single currency was fierce. Margaret Thatcher, Conservative prime minister from 1979 to 1990, was anti-euro. The Tories remained largely euroskeptic under Thatcher's successor, John Major. Then came Black Wednesday, the day in 1992 on which Britain was forced to halt its membership of euro's precursor, the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Black Wednesday was seen as proof a monetary union and European currency could not work, says Hans-Joachim Voth, research professor of economics at Barcelona's Universitat Pompeu Fabra. Adding to the political humiliation, Black Wednesday is also remembered as the day which enabled investor George Soros to collect an estimated $1 billion in profits from betting against the pound. Tony Blair's Labour government, which succeeded Major's Conservative government, was in favor of joining the euro, but only if certain economic tests were met. They weren't, and the UK stayed out. Blair reiterated his support of the euro in an interview with the BBC this year, but said the case for Britain was not compelling. Public opinion polls have showed opposition to adopting the currency at up to 75%. According to Voth, Britain ""has always had the problem of wanting to be a part of Europe, without really signing up for the European project."" What was the issue with Greece? The Greek economy has been in trouble since the country joined the euro, due to a mix of overspending and inability to raise enough revenue. In 2004, it admitted that the country's financial position was worse than reported and had breached the eurozone entry requirements. By 2008 the government had narrowly passed a belt-tightening budget, designed to trim its massive national debt burden, triggering massive protests. In 2009, Greece admitted its deficit would be more than 12% of gross domestic product -- far higher than previous estimates and more than four times the requirements of entry into the eurozone. The country was hit with ratings downgrades, pushing its sovereign bonds into so-called ""junk"" territory, and the damage continued to spiral. Despite the introduction of brutal austerity measures -- which have prompted waves of violent protests -- Greece has been unable to balance its books. There is a risk it could be forced out of the eurozone. Why is the eurozone cracking? Greece's shifting economic data created panic among investors, who stopped buying its bonds, making it impossible to fund itself. In May 2010, Greece received a â‚¬110 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund and its eurozone partners. A European bail-out fund was then set up to enable a more organized response to subsequent emergencies. The fund was quickly tapped again as turmoil gripped the markets. Ireland's banks were revealed to be a black hole of cash and it was forced to tap the fund for cash. Portugal followed, then Greece returned for more financial help. While the countries which have been bailed out have specific problems -- Greece's lax tax collection, and Ireland's black hole of a banking system, for example -- the problem has been exacerbated by a currency which shackles the weak to the strong, economists say. Political difficulties in driving through a decisive plan for reining in the crisis has fed the panic. What happens if a member defaults? Nobody really knows, and the uncertainty has fed massive volatility in both the credit and equity markets across the world, driving the costs of global stocks dramatically lower and pushing both Europe and the U.S. -- which is also facing massive financial problems -- toward another recession. The return of a recession will likely create increased unemployment and lower wages. A default by Greece, or its departure from the eurozone, also carries contagion risk. That means investors will worry about other nations in trouble -- such as Italy, which makes up 17% of the eurozone economy, nearly seven times bigger than the economy of Greece -- and further increase financial instability across the globe. Politically, it will ignite the debate about whether the European dream, and the euro, can survive, and if it should have even been created in the first place.","The Treaty of Maastricht which enabled the euro's creation was signed in 1992 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray's lawyers began presenting the defense case Monday, calling a doctor who testified that Jackson asked him for an intravenous anesthetic to help him sleep two months before his death. A nurse, who began her testimony late Monday, is expected to testify Tuesday that Jackson asked her, also two months before he died, for IV infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol. The prosecution rested its case in the involuntary manslaughter trial of Michael Jackson's doctor Monday morning with the conclusion of testimony by its anesthesiology expert. Defense lawyers will use the next three or four days to challenge the prosecution's contention that Dr. Conrad Murray's alleged reckless use of propofol to help Jackson sleep makes him criminally responsible for the pop icon's death. A Los Angeles doctor who treated Jackson off and on for about two decades for ""his profound sleep disorder"" testified that Jackson called him to his home to ask for help about two months before his death. Dr. Allan Metzger testified that Jackson asked him for ""intravenous sleep medicine,"" but he did not specifically name a drug. ""I think he used the word juice,"" he said. Jackson told him he needed an anesthetic delivered by IV because ""he did not believe any oral medicine would be helpful,"" Metzger said. Metzger said that despite Jackson's request, he only gave him a prescription for two oral sedatives to help him sleep. The defense called Metzger in an apparent effort to show Jackson was seeking -- and getting drugs -- from other doctors at the same time Dr. Murray was working as his full-time physician. The judge stopped the defense from asking Metzger questions about Jackson's visits to Dr. Arnold Klein, the dermatologist who gave Jackson Demerol injections during frequent visits to his Beverly Hills clinic in the months before his death. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren used the defense witness to make the prosecution's point that using propofol outside a clinical setting is unacceptable. ""Is there any amount of money that would have convinced you to give him intervenous propofol in his house?"" Walgren asked Metzger. ""Absolutely not,"" Metzger answered. The defense then called Cherilyn Lee, a nurse who practices nutrition and natural remedies, who testified that she worked with Jackson to help his fatigue and insomnia from February through April of 2009. After two months of using IV infusions of vitamins, ""sophisticated"" vitamin smoothies and bedtime teas, Jackson began asking for more help, Lee testified. ""His complaint was 'I have a problem sleeping and all the natural remedies and everything you're doing is not working,'"" she said. ""When I need sleep, I need to go to sleep right away."" The court session ended just before defense lawyer Ed Chernoff could ask Lee to describe what kind of help Jackson was asking for, but the nurse previously told CNN that he requested propofol. ""I told him this medication is not safe,"" Lee told CNN on June 30, 2009. ""He said, 'I just want to get some sleep. You don't understand. I just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep.'"" Closing arguments could come as soon as Friday, depending on the length of the defense's case and the prosecution's rebuttal, but they could be pushed to next Monday, based on comments by lawyers and the judge. Janet Jackson canceled shows in Australia to be with her family in Los Angeles for the final days of Murray's trial, but she did not arrive home in time to attend Monday morning's session. She sat with her parents and several siblings during the first five days of the trial, but she has not been at court in nearly three weeks. ""After talking with my family last night, I decided we must be together right now,"" she said in a statement posted Sunday on her website, announcing that three shows this week in Melbourne are canceled. The concert promoter told Jackson fans it was ""important that Janet is with her family at this critical point in the hearing."" Katherine Jackson will travel to London next weekend to fulfill a commitment to attend the premiere of ""Michael Jackson: Life of an Icon,"" a documentary about her son, an aide to Jackson said Monday. She agreed to the trip before it was known the trial could last into next week, Trent Jackson said. The first three defense witnesses, called in rapid order Monday morning, were all police officers. A Beverly Hills police officer, the first defense witness, testified that a 911 call routed through her department at 12:20 p.m. on June 25, 2009, asked for help at Jackson's Holmby Hills estate. A Los Angeles police officer testified next about retrieving seven minutes of video from a security camera at Jackson's home. The video, shown to the jury, captured Jackson's arrival home from his last rehearsal just before 1 a.m. on the morning he died. Michael Jackson fans sitting in court appeared to become emotional as they viewed the last video ever recorded of the pop icon alive, grainy security camera video of Jackson arriving home from his last rehearsal. Murray's lawyers have said they plan to call about 15 witnesses, including three medical experts and several of Murray's patients from his clinics in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Houston. Two other LAPD investigators were called to the stand by the defense Monday and testified briefly. Randy Phillips, the head of AEG Live, is also expected to called by the defense. Murray's lawyers have argued that Jackson was pressured by Phillips, whose company was promoting his comeback concerts in London, to show up healthy and on time for rehearsals or else the tour might be canceled. Murray told detectives Jackson begged for his ""milk,"" his nickname for propofol, after a sleepless night and just hours before he died from what the coroner has said was an overdose of the surgical anesthetic. Murray, in a police interview, said he was using sedatives to wean Jackson from propofol, which he had used almost every night for two months to fight his insomnia. But after a long, restless night and morning, the lorazepam and midazolam had no effect, Murray said. ""I've got to sleep, Dr. Conrad,"" Murray said Jackson pleaded to him. ""I have these rehearsals to perform. I must be ready for the show in England. Tomorrow, I will have to cancel my performance, because you know I cannot function if I don't get to sleep."" Murray said he gave in to Jackson's pleas and gave him an injection of 25 milligrams of propofol around 10:40 a.m. The testimony of anesthesiologist expert Dr. Steven Shafer, concluded Monday morning, 11 days after he took the stand as the prosecution's 33rd, but perhaps most important, witness. Shafer testified last week that there was no way Jackson got only the amount of propofol Murray said he did, based on the high level of the drug found in blood taken during his autopsy. The ""only scenario"" to explain Jackson's death was that he overdosed on propofol infused through an IV drip set up by Murray, Shafer said. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson's death was a homicide, the result of ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with sedatives. The defense contends Jackson self-administered the fatal dose, along with sedatives, without Murray knowing. Shafer said the level of propofol in Jackson's blood taken during his autopsy could not have been from either Murray or Jackson injecting the drug, but only from an IV system that was still flowing when his heart stopped. Prosecutors, however, opened the door for one scenario in which Jackson, not Murray, could have triggered the overdose. ""Can you rule out the possibility that Michael Jackson manipulated something to cause it to flow?"" Deputy District Attorney David Walgren asked Friday. ""That's a possibility,"" Shafer said. But that is assuming Murray set up the drip and left Jackson's side, he said. Would Shafer's opinion that Murray was responsible for Jackson's death change if he knew Jackson turned the drip on? ""No, if Michael Jackson had reached up, seen the roller clamp and opened it himself, this is a foreseeable consequence of setting up an essentially dangerous way of giving drugs,"" Shafer said. ""It doesn't change things at all. It would still be considered abandonment.""","NEW: Jackson asked for ""intravenous sleep medicine,"" Dr. Allan Metzger says .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- An expert on Lincoln photography thinks a photograph found in Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's family-owned album showing President Abraham Lincoln in front of the White House could be one of the last photos taken of the 16th president before he was assassinated in 1865. A photo found in Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's family album is verified to contain an image of Abraham Lincoln. Grant's great-great grandson Ulysses S. Grant VI had seen the previously unpublished image in the general's personal photo album, but didn't think much of it until he scrutinized it earlier this year. ""I started to think that it might be the White House,"" said Grant, a construction business owner from Springfield, Missouri. ""Then I started to look at the height difference between the people in the photo."" Thinking that the towering individual commanding the attention of the other people in the image could be Lincoln -- who stood 6-foot-4 and is the nation's tallest president -- Grant called Keya Morgan, a renowned collector and scholar of Lincoln and Gen. Grant photographs, to see whether his suspicions could be verified. Morgan, who owns the world's largest collection of Lincoln artifacts and original photographs, persuaded Grant to take the small photo out of the album to see whether any clues could be found on the back -- particularly the name of the photographer. ""If you don't know who the photographer is, it's like not knowing who your father and mother are,"" Morgan said. Sure enough, the seal of photographer Henry F. Warren appeared on the back, along with an inscription: ""Lincoln in front of the White House,"" dated 1865. Grant recognized the handwriting as that of his great-grandfather and Gen. Grant's youngest son, Jesse Grant. Those indicators, along with a revenue stamp used from 1864-66 to raise money during the Civil War, helped convince Morgan that the photograph could be the well-documented missing photo from Lincoln's last ""sitting.""  Watch how photograph was verified » . According to Morgan -- who cites Lincoln's secretaries John Hay and John Nicolay -- Warren took the last three photographs of Lincoln on March 6, 1865, just two days after his second inauguration. Morgan says Warren was desperate to take pictures of Lincoln, so he staged the first act of paparazzi photography. According to Morgan, Warren first took photos of the president's son Tad on his pony. The following day, Warren gave the pictures to Tad and told him to summon his father. Morgan says that Warren was already set up to take the photo outside the White House, and that Lincoln gave him access afterward to take two more portraits on the White House balcony. Will Stapp, founding curator of the National Portrait Gallery's photography department and a professional photograph appraiser, agrees with Morgan's assessment of the long-lost image. ""The figure itself, the physique -- in looking at it under a magnifying glass, I can see the shape of his beard; I can see the hairline,"" Stapp told CNN. ""It's similar to the impression you get from other photos taken of [Lincoln] from the same distance, like at the Gettysburg Address and his inauguration."" Stapp and Morgan also say it appears that Lincoln is wearing the same clothes in the outdoor photo as he wore for the portraits taken the same day. As one of only 130 photographs of Lincoln, it is an extraordinary find not only because of its proximity to Lincoln's death, but because it shows him in a natural stance. ""You could put yourself in the shoes of the people around [Lincoln] and see what it was like to live at the White House,"" said Morgan, who says he receives 10 to 20 requests a day asking him to verify potential Lincoln photographs. Morgan, who purchased the photo from Grant, says he has received thousands of e-mails from Lincoln aficionados commenting on the find. His Web site, lincolnimages.com, received more than 5 million hits on Tuesday and crashed because of the traffic overload.","Ulysses S.

"(CNN) -- When New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg instructed five hospitals to evacuate their patients from Hurricane Irene's path, one replied it couldn't follow his order. Administrators from New York University-Langone Medical Center explained that six patients in the intensive care unit were so sick that moving them might kill them, and so the mayor's office gave permission to keep them in the hospital throughout the storm. It then fell to Elaine Rowinski, nurse manager of the intensive care unit, to find seven nurses willing to stay at the hospital, right in the hurricane's predicted path and just 100 yards from the East River, which many feared would overflow. It turned out she had nothing to worry about. ""I could have had 20 nurses if I'd needed them,"" she said. ""That's how many called me up to volunteer."" Rowinski stayed at the hospital all weekend as the doctors and nurses who also stayed listened to the wind and the rain through the boarded-up windows. ""I had no qualms about staying, no fears at all,"" she said. ""We train for these disasters."" Brainstorming with her staff, Rowinski came up with a list of what they might need during the storm. The nurses kept flashlights by each bedside and plugged machines into the red outlets on the wall, which connect to the generators on top of the building, in case they lost power from Con Edison. They also kept a three-day supply of medicine next to each patient's bed in the event they needed to evacuate quickly. About 200 staff members stayed at NYU, including engineers, security guards, housekeepers, blood bank staff, and two doctors. Four family members stayed all weekend with the patients. Some of the patients had neurological diseases, while others had respiratory problems or infectious diseases. Many were on life support, but those that were conscious were told Friday they might have to be evacuated. ""They were so relieved when they found out they could stay,"" Rowinski said. As for Rowinski, she finally went home Monday afternoon after nearly three days straight at the hospital. While she was working, her husband had to evacuate their house in Oceanside, on Long Island. ""He told me he kept a picture of me by the dog so he'd remember me,"" she said with a laugh. CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.","As Irene approached, 6 patients were too sick to evacuate from NYU-Langone Medical Center .

"(CNN) -- Manti Te'o, the Notre Dame linebacker at the center of an online hoax involving his non-existent girlfriend, will sit down for his first on-camera interview this week with Katie Couric, the talk show host said Sunday. Couric announced on her Twitter account that Te'o and his parents would take part in the interview airing Thursday on the ""Katie"" show. No other details were given. Sports website Deadspin broke the story Wednesday that the girlfriend that Te'o, this year's Heisman Trophy runner-up, had talked about and had claimed died in September of leukemia wasn't real. Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick told reporters later that day Te'o was the victim, having been fooled into believing that a woman he met on the Internet, but never in person, was his girlfriend. After issuing a brief statement Wednesday, Te'o sat down Friday with ESPN for an off-camera interview. There, one of the best defenders in college football this season defended himself against allegations that he was somehow involved in the online scheme. ""I wasn't faking it,"" Te'o told ESPN's Jeremy Schaap. ""I wasn't part of this."" Manti Te'o denies he was part of girlfriend hoax . Thursday's interview with Couric would be the first time Te'o has spoken on camera about the hoax. His parents, Brian and Ottilia Te'o, who also haven't spoken out since the story broke, will also answer questions, according to Couric. Te'o rose to national prominence leading Notre Dame's Fighting Irish to an undefeated regular season. As he and his team excelled, Te'o told interviewers in September and October that his grandmother and girlfriend, whom he described as a 22-year-old Stanford University student, had died within hours of each other. ""I miss 'em, but I know that I'll see them again one day,"" he said then. Te'o told Schaap that the hoax was created by a man named Ronaiah Tuiasosopo. He said Tuiasosopo contacted him via Twitter the day the story broke, explaining he'd created the hoax and apologizing, according to Schaap. CNN has not seen the tweets Te'o allegedly received from Tuiasosopo. ""Two guys and a girl are responsible for the whole thing,"" Te'o said, according to ESPN. Ronaiah Tuiasosopo hasn't spoken publicly, nor had members of his family, in the past week. On Sunday, though, CNN asked Peter Navy Tuiasosopo about Te'o blaming his nephew, Ronaiah. ""It definitely takes two to tango,"" the uncle said. ""This is not just a matter of blaming it all on Ronaiah."" Peter Navy Tuiasosopo made his remarks after a service at Oasis Christian Church of Antelope Valley in Lancaster, California, near the family's Palmdale home about 60 miles northeast of Los Angeles. There, about 50 people attended an early afternoon service led by Ronaiah's father, the Rev. Titus Tuiasosopo. Ronaiah Tuiasosopo was not among them. The almost two-hour service was filled with singing, clapping, hugging and a few veiled references to the controversy. The Rev. Titus Tuiasosopo welcomed members of the media, without cameras, and quipped, ""I've been practicing to say 'no comment' in 20 languages."" The pastor made no reference to his son specifically, or the alleged girlfriend hoax, during the service. At the conclusion of the service, he said, fighting back tears, ""I want to thank all of my church family, my cousins, those who are here: I love you."" Afterward, Peter Navy Tuiasosopo told CNN that Ronaiah ""is holding up well."" ""I know he doesn't feel his best, but he definitely feels like ... this family is there for him,"" said Peter Navy Tuiasosopo, who is an actor. ""And if not for this young man and his strength and family with God, he would have done something stupid.""

"(CNN) -- A former police officer convicted of multiple murders in the 1980s was executed Tuesday night in Florida. Manuel Pardo, 56, was pronounced dead at 7:47 p.m. EST at the Florida State Prison in Starke, according to Ann Howard, spokeswoman with the Florida Department of Corrections. His last meal consisted of red beans and rice, roasted pork chops, plantains, avocado and tomato slices with olive oil, eggnog and pumpkin pie, she said. Pardo was sentenced to death after being convicted in 1988 of nine counts of first-degree murder. His attorneys had argued that Florida's recent change in the drug combination it uses for lethal injections would violate their client's civil rights. A judge denied the complaint. In another legal filing, the Supreme Court of Florida denied Pardo's argument that he should have never been tried because he was incompetent to stand trial. David Waksman, who prosecuted the case, dismissed the claim, saying, ""He was just a cold-blooded killer who used to be a cop."" Pardo's life started on the other side of the law, according to court documents filed by his attorneys. At age 17, he enlisted in the Navy and served honorably from 1974 to 1978. In 1981, Pardo re-enlisted in the Marines and remained a reservist while he worked for the Florida Highway Patrol and the Sweetwater Police Department. In 1985, Pardo was fired from the police department and left the reserves when, according to court documents, ""he falsely testified in court about police corruption in the Bahamas."" His attorney said the stress of losing his job, compounded with a serious undiagnosed disease, turned him into ""someone he was not,"" a killer. During his trial, Pardo took the stand and admitted to the murders. ""He came up with this vigilante story,"" recalls Waksman. ""He said, 'I'm ridding the community of this vermin and technically it is not murder because they're not human beings.'""

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraqi soldiers fired Friday on Sunni anti-government protesters demanding the Shiite prime minister step down, health officials said. Provincial health officials said that at least four people were killed and 42 wounded in the shootings in Falluja in western Anbar province, a Sunni stronghold where protesters have been denouncing what they call second-class treatment by the government. The officials backed off earlier reports that at least five people were killed, citing the chaos of scene. Read more: Thousands protest in Shiite provinces in southern Iraq . Witnesses told CNN that Iraqi soldiers opened fire after they ordered the demonstrators to stop filming dozens of Iraqi security forces on the rooftops surrounding al-Etisam Square. But other witnesses said that Iraqi soldiers fired when protesters started throwing objects at them. The soldiers continued firing live bullets for several minutes. Angry protesters chanted: ""Those are al-Maliki's forces, those are al-Maliki's militias,"" referring to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. Iraqi authorities imposed curfew in Falluja on Friday until further notice. Religious leaders in Falluja have called for Iraqi forces to leave the city and for a funeral procession Saturday for those killed in the incident. ""We have been demonstrating peacefully. But now we warn al-Maliki that the blood of Falluja martyrs will not be shed in vain,"" protester Abdul Wahed Ammar said. Al-Maliki on Friday said the violence in Falluja doesn't surprise his administration. He cited ""conspiracies"" plotted by regional intelligence services, vestiges of the old regime, al Qaeda and those with sectarian agendas. The government, he said, has warned before about ""those who have hostile agendas against Iraq, its political process and its democracy."" He said dangers are ""increasing day after day in an attempt to blow up the security situation in the country and drag the armed forces into confrontations."" The minister of defense ordered an investigation into the shootings, Anbar Satellite TV said. Iraq's government spokesman did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. The protest in Falluja, dubbed ""Friday of No Retreat"" by organizers, is the latest in a series held in predominantly Sunni regions of Iraq. They have been countered by mostly Shiite, pro-government demonstrations, raising fears that the sectarian division could bring violence in the streets. In another development , Iraqi soldiers withdrew from several security posts in and around the city and went back to their main military headquarters in Falluja, according to police officials in the city. Read more: Clashes erupt at Iraqi protest as sectarian tensions flare . The protests have grown in recent weeks. They began in late December when Sunni demonstrators took to the streets in Anbar province, which borders Jordan and Syria, to protest al-Maliki's order to arrest the bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafaie Esawi, a Sunni. The arrest of Esawi's bodyguards came just hours after President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd who is widely viewed as a stabilizing political force in Iraq, left the country to undergo treatment for cancer. The protesters also are demanding the release of detainees they said were held without charges, calling the government corrupt and accusing it of unfairly targeting Iraq's Sunni people. Iraq's Arab Sunnis and Kurds have accused al-Maliki and his Shiite political party of working to consolidate power in Iraq by cutting them out of the political process, an allegation that comes as U.S. lawmakers raise concerns about Iraq strengthening its ties with Shiite-dominated Iran. Sunnis make up about 20% of Iraq's estimated population of more than 27 million, whereas about 60% to 65% are Shiite. Since the fall of Saddam Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime in 2003, Sunnis in Iraq have been largely disaffected. The gulf was widened in 2005 when Sunnis boycotted the country's election, opening the way to a heavily dominated Shiite government. The sectarian divisions translated into violence in the streets in 2006 and 2007, with fighting that nearly ripped the country apart. Opinion: Protests are as mindless as anti-Islam film .

"(CNN) -- The crisis over the Egyptian constitution triggered by President Mohamed Morsy's adoption of sweeping powers is just the latest chapter in a long-standing ideological struggle in the Middle East. Morsy, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate who came to power after the 2011 Arab Spring revolution that deposed long-time Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, says he needs the new powers ""to speed reform."" His rivals say it is all motivated by the Brotherhood's Islamist agenda for controlling the country. Morsy is not the first -- and given the upheavals of the Arabic Spring, is unlikely to be the last -- Muslim leader to seek a constitutional way to create functioning state institutions in a region where the collapse of the Ottoman Empire led more often to tyranny or puppet regimes than strong democratic states. The drive to institutionalize the states of the Muslim world was the primary objective for most political parties in the region in the early 20th century. Muslim intellectuals, shocked by the tyranny and the deterioration of their nations - especially when compared to the rapid advance of the West both politically and militarily - tried to reverse the course by political means. However, they soon found out that confronting the old establishment would require more radical approaches. In 1907, a constitutional revolution was declared in Shiite Persia, and a year later Muslims, Christians and Jews marched in Istanbul -- triggering in 1908 what was called ""the second constitutional era."" The events that followed eventually led to the dissolution of the Sunni Ottoman Empire. A decade later, the Ottoman Empire found itself in an unprecedented situation, defeated and occupied by the Western allies of Britain, France, Russia and Italy. The young Turkish leader, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, led a national movement, fought the allies and the sultan, then pushed for constitutional changes by which the last Ottoman sultan, Mohamed VI, would be a spiritual leader, or ""khalifa"", without any governing or symbolic authority. For the first time in the history of the Muslim world, representatives of the people controlled the state. Mohamed VI was later expelled from Turkey, and by 1924 the Caliphate system was abolished. This groundbreaking event left the Muslim world in both religious and political chaos. At the time when the Allies were establishing new states for old peoples in the region, scholars and clerics from Morocco to India went into extensive discussions about the vague future of the Muslim ""nation."" Their task was not easy - even Ataturk had his own fatwa, or religious edict, to legitimize his deeds, issued by ""pro-modernization"" clerics. Divided about the ways to adapt to change, the most prominent Muslim clerics in 1926 decided to accept an invitation from King Fuad of Egypt to submit a plan for the future. The king thought that the conclusion of the conference would see him anointed as the new ""khalifa"" of all Muslims, but his dream vanished. Many Egyptian clerics refused the idea of having a khalifa in a country under British occupation, and the liberal parties were keen to remind Fuad about the 1923 constitution which he had issued himself in the wake of the huge changes, hundreds of miles away, in Turkey. The conference in Cairo may not have been fruitful but it was decisive in reshaping the ideological map in the region. On one hand there was Sheikh Rachid Rida, an influential cleric from what is now known as Lebanon, who led the call to re-establish the Caliphate system. On the other side stood the clerics of north Africa, spearheaded by Sheikh Abdulhamid ben Badis from Algeria and Abdulkarim Alkhattabi from Morocco, who both praised Ataturk for his strong leadership, which they believed would benefit the Muslim nation. Amid confusion across the Islamic world over about the proper source of power, the legitimate ruler and the true nature of constitutions, Hasan Al Banna -- one of Sheikh Rachid Rida's most loyal followers - in 1928 formed the first version of what would later be known as the Muslim Brotherhood movement. In one of his letters, Al-Banna stated he was moving in the direction of establishing the movement in response to what he called the fall of the Caliphate system. He later came up with one of his movement's most famous slogans: the ""Quran is Our Constitution"". Much has changed in the region during the last nine decades, but not the enigmatic nature of constitutionalism in this part of the world. Numerous coups, wars and crises strangled or mutated any attempt to modernize the local states -- and old ""dictators"", whether they were army generals or liberals or leftists, continued to manipulate the laws. Constitutions were not social contracts, but rather a code of conduct imposed on the people. ""Subjects"" were never transformed into ""citizens"", and basic rights were ""boons"" granted by the rulers and could be easily revoked. Constitutions had become just another tool in the hands of dictators. During that time, most Islamic mainstream movements, including the Muslim Brotherhood, acknowledged the need for having fundamental principles to run the political process - an easily drawn conclusion, given the decades of oppression to which the movements were subjected. But the movement couldn't overcome the critical duality of ""Quran is Our Constitution."" How could a divine script be protected by manmade principles and yet overpower them at the same time? It is not a coincidence that constitutional reforms were considered a priority in all the Arab Spring countries -- and that popular Islamic movements in countries such as Tunisia and Egypt have the upper hand in redrawing laws. Muslim Brotherhood branches in North Africa, especially Tunisia, were able to make use of the heritage of sheikhs Ben Badis and Alkhattabi, and quickly abandoned the call for a Sharia-based constitution. For them, the Turkish model led by Recep Tayyip Erdogan to deal with constitutional problems is a better option. The task doesn't look as easy for Morsy and the Brotherhood in Egypt. He is surrounded by Salafist hardliners who are trying to outflank him on the far right as the country's ""true representatives"" of Islam; and on the other side is a coalition of liberal and national movements, including members of Mubarak's old party, who are ""united in opposition to the vague 'Islamic Project,'"" according to opposition coordinator Mohammad ElBaradei. One can argue that Morsy's constitutional decree unleashed a crisis, and that the draft is far from being perfect, especially for women and minorities. It might be a mistake, but it is a political one made by the first freely-elected Egyptian president. The most important thing to observe in this ""spring"" is that those who were labelled as ""radicals"" for decades are moving towards finding a constitutional frame for the internal political struggle. But those who are watching the scene from the West should keep in mind that the constitutional evolution in Europe was a slower and equally messy process.","Drive to institutionalize states of Muslim world was priority for most parties in early 1900s .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A devout Hindu said Wednesday he was confident that a British court will rule that laws preventing him from being cremated on an open-air funeral pyre in ""a sacrament of fire"" are a breach of his human rights. Davender Ghai arrives at the High Court for his challenge to be allowed to be cremated on a funeral pyre. Davender Ghai, who emigrated to England from Kenya in 1958, has a number of ailments including diabetes, asthma, anemia and a degenerative spinal disease but says he fears he will not be allowed to die with ""dignity."" The 70-year-old spiritual healer said that when he does die, he would like his eldest son Sanjay, who lives in Canada, to light the pyre as his family watches what they believe is his soul being released from his body. Local officials in his home city of Newcastle, in northern England, rejected his request for a license for a pyre site, ruling that cremations outside of crematoria were illegal under the 1902 Cremation Act.  Watch as Hindu campaigns for pyres » . Ghai, a founder member of the Anglo-Asian Friendship Society (AAFS), subsequently took his legal challenge to the High Court on the grounds that this refusal was discriminatory and violated his human rights. He and his supporters were in court this week as his legal counsel Ramby de Mello said he was ""yearning to die"" according to the Hindu religion and to be cremated ""with dignity."" What do you think? Asked if he believed he would win the ruling, Ghai told CNN on Wednesday: ""I'm very, very hopeful that we'll get it. The thing is we've got good support now. When we first started we had a few people. ""They thought it was illegal and outlawed, so they wouldn't come forward. Now we've got very, very good support. I think about 90 percent of the Hindu organizations are begging us."" If he is successful when the court gives its ruling on Thursday, other Hindus and Sikhs could be allowed similar last rites. Ghai said some Hindus currently send the bodies of family members to India for cremation but if the ruling goes in his favor, UK cremations on funeral pyres would be much cheaper. ""Many people are offended and upset (by the refusal to allow funeral pyres in Britain), because what they'll think is that all other religions got what they wanted, Hindus didn't get what they wanted. ""The reason being they're very peaceful people. They're coming to me and say you've done well to ask them for this. At least somebody has spoken on behalf of the Hindus."" He described normal cremation facilities as ""a mechanized humiliation of dignity -- a waste disposal process devoid of spiritual significance."" ""Confining bodies in coffins and concealing the cremation process"" did not reflect his cultural values, Ghai added. In July 2006, Ghai and the AAFS escaped prosecution after cremating the body of Rajpal Mehat, an Indian-born Sikh, on an open pyre in a remote field hired from an apparently unwitting landowner, PA reported. Ghai dismissed fears that cremation on funeral pyres could damage the environment and pledged to do everything to minimize pollution. ""They burned about 200,000 cattles because of foot and mouth disease; if burning 200,000 cattles then didn't affect the environment, how can a few bodies affect the environment?""","British Hindu fights in court to be allowed to be cremated on funeral pyre .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The mangled wrecks of cars being carried out of Japan's Sasago Tunnel suggest there was little motorists could do to escape the sudden collapse of the ceiling above them. A day after the disaster, one main theory has emerged as to what caused the collapse, which killed nine people who were trapped in their cars by rubble or the flames that broke out shortly after. At a press briefing on Monday, the executive officer of the tunnel's operator said it appeared that some ""anchor bolts"" used to secure concrete slabs to the tunnel ceiling were missing. ""There were parts of concrete (slabs) where bolts had fallen off,"" Ryoichi Yoshizawa said, according to a spokesman for Central Japan Expressway Company or NEXCO-Central. ""The aging of the bolts or the concrete slabs could be a potential cause (of the collapse),"" Yoshizawa said. He did not say how many bolts were found to be missing or how they came to be loose. Yoshizawa added that while regular checks had been performed on the tunnel, they were visual checks and there was no physical testing. Read more: Nine bodies recovered from tunnel . Emergency inspections have been ordered on 49 tunnels across the country with the same ceiling structure, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. There are 1,575 highways tunnels in Japan and around a quarter of those are more than 30 years old, including the Sasago Tunnel which opened in 1977, the ministry said. The tunnel's ceiling gave way on Sunday morning at around 8 a.m. local time. Witnesses recalled the horror of smoke filling up the tunnel as huge concrete slabs rained down on traffic below. Japanese highway police said Monday the section of concrete that fell was 110 meters (360 feet) long. Charred bodies were pulled from the debris, including five from a single station wagon. Three others were in a burned vehicle, according to a police spokesperson, while another body was found in a truck. ""It was terrifying. I don't think I could ever drive through the tunnel again,"" one shaken survivor told TV Asahi, as black and white video released by NEXCO showed rescue workers in flashlight-topped helmets stepping over rubble. The tunnel has been closed for the removal of debris and while experts ascertain the risk of a secondary accident. NEXCO says it's unsure how long the process could take. Speaking to reporters at the scene, Motohiro Takamisawa, the chief of NEXCO's Otsuki Safety Center, also referred to a potential problem with the bolts securing the tunnel's ceiling slabs. ""At this moment we're presuming that the top anchor bolts have come loose,"" he was reported as saying. Takamizawa added that the bolts hadn't been changed since the tunnel first opened in the late 1970s. However, a company spokesman told CNN that Takamizawa's comments should not be interpreted as the company's official statement and that it could not confirm whether that was the case. One expert told Asahi TV said that it's possible that years of traffic vibrations had contributed to the tunnel's collapse. ""Over the course of 35 years, all the shaking caused by cars has probably caused the bolts and nuts in the tunnel to loosen. As a result they fell off,"" said Hiroshi Chikahisa, head of the Geosystem Engineering Institute at Yamaguchi University. Immediately after the disaster, a company spokesman said the Sasago Tunnel, located about 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Tokyo, was subject to annual inspections with more detailed checks every five years. It had been checked in the last couple of months. At the company's Monday briefing, a NEXCO spokesman said, ""There was no record that we have conducted the tapping inspection at top of the ceiling in the tunnel."" He was referring to a method used to identify potential damage within concrete structures that was mentioned in the company's 2011 annual report. It says, ""although hammer tapping test is commonly carried out to investigate concrete structures, it takes enormous time and cost to conduct the test on all concrete structures we have."" Instead, it says the company inspects concrete structures using infrared cameras, an inspection technology which measures the difference in temperature between ""sound conditions and damaged areas"" to detect potential weak points. There as no explicit reference to testing carried out on tunnels. The Sasago Tunnel runs for 4.7 kilometers along a stretch of the Chuo Expressway which runs for 367 kilometers, through a mountainous region, connecting Tokyo with the Nagoya in the Chubu region of Japan. Its operator, NEXCO-Central is one of three companies started in 1995 after the privatization of Japan's Highway Public Corporation. NEXCO-Central manages more than 1,700 kilometers of expressways in Tokyo and the Chubu, Hokuriku and Kinki regions, used by almost 1.9 million cars on any given day. Journalist Toshi Maeda, CNN's Junko Ogura and Alex Zolbert contributed to this report.","Collapse of Sasago Tunnel is being blamed on failure of ""anchor bolts""

"(Financial Times) -- The erosion of central bank independence around the world threatens to unleash a round of competitive exchange rate devaluations, which leading economies have so far avoided during the financial crisis, the president of Germany's Bundesbank warned on Monday. Jens Weidmann, whose institution's own fierce independence from political influence was the model for the European Central Bank when it was founded, said Stephen King, the chief economist at HSBC, was ""perhaps right"" in forecasting an end to the era of central bank independence. ""It is already possible to observe alarming infringements, for example in Hungary or in Japan, where the new government is massively involving itself in the affairs of the central bank, is emphatically demanding an even more aggressive monetary policy and is threatening an end to central bank autonomy,"" Mr Weidmann said in a speech in Frankfurt. ""Whether intended or not, one consequence could be the increased politicisation of the exchange rate,"" he said, according to a text of his speech provided by the Bundesbank. ""Until now the international monetary system got through the crisis without competitive devaluations and I hope very much it stays that way."" Both the Bundesbank and later the ECB were founded on mandates that gave them wide powers and freedom from political interference in return for focusing solely on keeping inflation in check. Some observers argue that the ECB now faces a challenge if other central banks ditch their own inflation targets and act to lower exchange rates against the euro, making exports from the embattled eurozone economies less competitive. Asked about the trend for central banks to look less at inflation-targeting and more at policy areas that affect exchange rates, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said earlier this month that the exchange rate was very important ""as far as growth and stability"" were concerned but was not a policy target for the ECB. He also noted that the Group of 20 leading industrial nations had pledged not to undertake competitive currency devaluations as such action undermines economic and financial stability. Mr Weidmann said the period in the 1980s and 1990s during which central banks around the world had been made independent had heralded a period of ""great moderation"" during which inflation fell. But the outbreak of the financial crisis and the growing energy and raw materials demand from fast-growing economies had put rising prices back on the agenda and complicated the job of a central bank. This had led to demands on central banks to support the financial system, stimulate the economy and lower government refinancing costs ""or even secure the solvency of a state"", he said. ""Overloading central banks with tasks and expectations is however certainly not the correct path towards sustainably overcoming the crisis."" The Bundesbank chief, whose concerns about straying from orthodox monetary policy prompted him to vote against and campaign openly against Mr Draghi's unlimited bond-buying plan last year, concluded by quoting approvingly from an interview Mr Draghi gave to the Financial Times in December. Central banks could best defend their independence by narrowly interpreting their mandate, he said. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Germany's Bundesbank pres. warns of erosion to global central bank independence .

"(CNN) -- A man detained in the disappearance of a Maryland woman during a vacation in Aruba will remain behind bars at least until the end of October, Aruban prosecutors said Monday. Gary Giordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after his traveling companion Robyn Gardner was last seen on a beach on the Caribbean Island. Attorney Michael Lopez went to court Monday morning and asked for Giordano's release. Lopez argued that authorities do not have enough evidence to continue to hold the 50-year-old Maryland man, but the court did not agree. ""Gary Giordano defense attorney's request for release has been denied,"" said Ann Angela from the Aruban prosecutor's office. Giordano's next detainment hearing is scheduled for the end of the month, Angela said. Giordano has maintained that he had been snorkeling with Gardner, when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, he allegedly said. He was arrested three days after the incident at the airport in Aruba as he waited for a flight back to the United States. He has been held for more than 70 days. Authorities say Giordano was the beneficiary of a $1.5 million accidental death insurance policy on Gardner, taken out just days before their trip. On Friday, Giordano hired a new lead defense attorney, Chris Lejuez, who spent two days in lengthy meetings with Giordano at the prison in Aruba where he is confined. Lejuez said Giordano has never changed his account of what happened. Instead, it is the police who come at Giordano with different theories as to what might have happened, he said. Even after all of their investigating, authorities ""cannot prove that a crime has been committed,"" Lejuez said. Lejuez said Giordano is simply trying to ""hold it together,"" and ""feels boxed in, accused of something he did not do."" At one point in their conversation, Lejuez said, his client ""broke down in tears"" of frustration. Lejuez will be working with Giordano's U.S.-based attorney, Jose Baez. Lejuez, who has 17 years of experience as a criminal defense attorney on the island, represented two Aruban security guards who were arrested early in the Natalee Holloway case in 2005 and were subsequently released. The guards had been implicated by Joran van der Sloot, who said he saw a security guard approach Holloway after he dropped her off at her hotel the night she vanished. Holloway's disappearance remains unsolved. Van der Sloot was arrested but never charged in connection with the disappearance, although he has faced other legal problems since then. Lejuez bristled at any suggestion of similarity between the Gardner case and the Holloway case. ""You had a suspect that kept changing his story,"" Lejuez said of van der Sloot. ""In this case, (Giordano's) story has been the same.""","NEW: Giordano's request for release from Aruban custody denied .

"Washington (CNN) -- They are losing the battle over higher taxes on the wealthy, so now Republicans are threatening a political war next year when it comes time to raise the nation's debt ceiling. With cracks appearing in their anti-tax facade and polls showing most Americans favoring President Barack Obama's stance in the fiscal cliff negotiations, GOP legislators are starting to advocate a tactical retreat to fight another day. Conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, promised the newly re-elected Obama ""one hell of a fight"" next year if the president forces through his plan for high-income earners to pay more taxes without agreeing to substantive steps to reduce the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt. ""But there will come a time in February and March where we have to raise the debt ceiling,"" Graham said Tuesday on ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" on CNN. ""I will not raise the debt ceiling ever again until we get significant entitlement reforms, because if we don't reform entitlements, we're going to become Greece,"" adding that the situation presented a chance for Obama to lead. ""But if he doesn't lead, there's going to be one hell of a fight over raising the debt ceiling."" Survey: 70% want compromise . Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell concurred on Tuesday, telling reporters that ""we are going to insist that we have another discussion about the future of our country in connection with his request of us to raise the debt ceiling."" Meanwhile, McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner on Tuesday called for Obama to make public the specific spending cuts he will offer in a deficit-reduction deal. Both complained that Obama was deliberately holding up progress in negotiations by refusing to provide the details of his cost saving plans. ""Where are the president's spending cuts?"" asked Boehner, R-Ohio, the lead GOP negotiator. ""The longer the White House slow walks this process, the closer our economy gets to the fiscal cliff."" In response, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Boehner and McConnell were wrong because Obama detailed his proposed spending cuts more than a year ago. He added that Republican negotiators had yet to offer any details of their own on how to raise more revenue from taxes, ""and it would be helpful if they did."" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, argued that the $1 trillion in spending cuts agreed to by Congress in the past two years should be counted toward deficit reduction in the current negotiations. ""Where are the cuts? They're in bills that you, Mr. Speaker, have voted for,"" Pelosi, D-California, said Tuesday. Three weeks remain to cut a deal before the automatic tax increases and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff go into effect on January 1. Without an agreement during the current lame-duck session of Congress, everyone's taxes will go up, and economists warn the impact of the fiscal cliff could cause another recession. Obama, Boehner speak by telephone after GOP counter-offer . However, the administration has signaled it can delay some of the effects to allow time to work out an agreement when a new Congress convenes in January. Obama has held a campaign-style series of public events to back his call for extending Bush-era tax cuts for 98% of Americans while allowing rates to return to higher 1990s levels on income over $250,000. The issue was central to his re-election in November, and Obama made clear on Monday that he intended to adhere to his belief that the wealthy must contribute more. ""I'm willing to compromise a little bit,"" Obama said at a Michigan diesel engine plant. However, he said higher tax rates on the the top income brackets was ""a principle I'm not going to compromise on."" The president's public push appears to be working as polls show that most Americans back the president's position. A new Politico/George Washington University survey on Monday said 60% of respondents supported Obama's proposal compared with 38% who opposed it. On Tuesday, a Gallup poll showed that 70% of adult Americans want Congress and the White House to reach a compromise that would avoid the fiscal cliff. A similar Gallup poll last week said 62% wanted compromise. The deficit-reduction debate hinges on the tax issue, with Republicans opposing any increase in tax rates in their quest to shrink government, while Obama and Democrats want to secure more tax revenue as part of a broader package. Americans already making big decisions over fiscal cliff . Both sides call for eliminating tax deductions and loopholes to raise more revenue, but Obama also demands an end to the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 for the top brackets. Republicans oppose the return to higher rates, saying it will inhibit job growth because small business owners declare their profits as personal income and therefore would face a tax increase. In response, Obama and Democrats note that their plan -- already approved by the Senate and needing House approval to be signed into law by the president -- affects just 2% of taxpayers and 3% of small business owners. While Republicans argue those small business owners account for about half of all business income, Democrats say that's because they include law firms, hedge funds traders and other high-income operations. Obama and Boehner met face to face on Sunday for the first time since November 16. It also was their first one-on-one meeting in more than a year, when deficit talks broke down. The outline for a deal has become clear in recent weeks. Both sides agree that more revenue from taxes should be part of the equation, with Obama seeking $1.6 trillion and Republicans offering $800 billion. A source close to the talks said Tuesday that the White House had floated the idea of dropping the revenue target to $1.2 trillion, then went up to $1.4 trillion on Monday. Later, Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said his side made a counteroffer to the White House ""that would achieve tax and entitlement reform to solve our looming debt crisis and create more American jobs."" Steel also said Boehner and Obama spoke on the phone after the Republican proposal was floated. Steel provided no further details on the counteroffer or the phone conversation, and repeated Boehner's earlier assertion that Republicans were waiting for Obama to identify specific spending cuts he would be willing to make. Federal Reserve may buy more bonds . Boehner's side wants additional revenue to come from tax reform, such as eliminating some deductions and loopholes, while Obama demands the higher rates on income over $250,000 for families as part of the equation. Republicans also seek savings from entitlement programs totaling another $800 billion or so, while Obama has proposed $400 billion in reduced entitlement costs. Social Security would not be included in the president's plan. Another sticky issue -- whether the need to raise the federal debt ceiling early next year should be part of the discussion -- also remains unresolved. Obama says absolutely not, while Boehner says that any increase in government borrowing to pay its bills must be offset by spending cuts. Graham's comments this week showed that Republicans plan to regroup around negotiations to raise the debt ceiling. From my home to the house: How to fix the fiscal cliff . He noted that Obama proposed making permanent a process originated by McConnell that would allow the president to increase the debt ceiling and Congress to then try to block it, an unlikely scenario given Democratic control of the Senate. ""That's going nowhere,"" Graham told Fox News on Monday, adding: ""He's not king. He's president."" However, a top House Democrat said that exploiting the debt ceiling for political gain would backfire on Republicans. ""Threatening to tank the entire economy, which is what would happen if we ever defaulted on our debt, is not a kind of negotiating strategy that is going to be popular with the American people,"" Rep. Chris Van Hollen told MSNBC on Monday. It remains unclear if a deal will happen before the end of the year or if the negotiations will carry over into 2013, after the fiscal cliff takes effect. Without action now on the fiscal cliff, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes. Even with a deal, revisions in the tax code and other changes would mean everyone pays a bit more starting next year. All signs point toward a two-step approach sought by Obama, with initial agreement now on some version of his tax plan with targets set for comprehensive negotiations on a broader deficit reduction deal in the new Congress next year. Opinion: Generals, get real and cut Pentagon spending . Such an outcome would put off the main worry of the fiscal cliff, the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts that would result in higher rates for everyone. Obama and Democrats say they would then be ready to negotiate significant savings from entitlement programs, while Republicans say they need to first see commitment on entitlement reforms before accepting any higher tax rates. McConnell, R-Kentucky, warned on the Senate floor on Tuesday that ""until the president gets specific about cuts, nobody should trust Democrats to put a dime in new revenue toward real deficit reduction or to stop their shakedown of the taxpayers at the top 2%."" He and Boehner want Obama to take some of the political heat for proposing cuts to entitlement programs and other government spending. On Tuesday, congressional Democrats rejected any cuts to the Medicaid health care system for poor and disabled Americans as part of a fiscal cliff deal. The opposition by Democrats showed the pressure Obama faces from his liberal base to avoid significant changes to the entitlement program that benefits millions. Some in Congress warn that the legislative process will need at least a week to work through potentially complex measures from any proposed deal, meaning there is a de facto deadline of Christmas Day at the very latest for negotiators. Retiring Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, predicted Tuesday on MSNBC that a deal would get worked out in a week's time. ""It would be wise on their part not to come too quickly with a deal because that would give all the interest groups a chance to get organized and try to kill it,"" Conrad said. ""And we know that on the right, on the left, special interest groups are just salivating at the chance to attack any agreement because, look, any agreement is going to have controversy attached to it."" iReport: How will the fiscal cliff affect you?

"Washington (CNN) -- As voters headed to the polls on Election Day, several of Mitt Romney's senior campaign aides said, they truly thought he was going to win the presidency and retake the White House Republicans lost four years earlier. ""I was cautiously optimistic,"" Romney pollster Neil Newhouse said. Instead, Barack Obama garnered 51% of the popular vote and 332 electoral votes to 206 and approximately 48% of the popular vote for his opponent. Newhouse was one of the key Romney campaign officials who joined counterparts from Obama's campaign at a Harvard University symposium last week that examined the election, the strategies and how various factors influenced the outcome. Reporting about the symposium, a post-election ritual dating back to 1972, was embargoed until audio recordings of the forum were released to the public on Monday. On Election Day: Romney polling showed Obama lead in Ohio on Sunday . During a session examining the general election, Romney aides said they believed their campaign had an intensity and enthusiasm advantage that would help spur voters to come out in larger numbers for Romney than the public polls were indicating. ""We thought that we had the potential to tilt the partisan electorate a couple points in our direction,"" Newhouse said. What the Republicans didn't see was a massive and effective get-out-the vote operation by the president's campaign, which increased its share of the Hispanic, African-American and youth vote over 2008 rates. As they heard the efficiency, breadth and depth of the Obama initiative described firsthand, Romney officials said their Obama counterparts deserved much credit both for the organization and for the results. Romney re-joins Marriott's corporate board . The general election panel, moderated by CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger and CNN Senior Political Analyst Ron Brownstein, was just one part of the event sponsored by Harvard's Institute of Politics. Besides the officials from the Romney and Obama campaigns, key personnel representing the Republican primary contenders as well as strategists for the major super PACs participated in various sessions looking at the election. Full audio: Harvard Institute of Politics symposium . Looking back at some of their efforts, Romney aides said they realized they had work to do to try to increase their support among Latinos -- especially in light of some of Romney's comments made during the Republican primary advocating self-deportation of illegal immigrants. Romney aides maintained they did not consider having the candidate apologize for those remarks when the general election came. ""We shifted resources to try to improve our numbers with Hispanics in Florida. We did see some movement in Florida ... but we definitely had issues we inherited. We also did the same in Nevada,"" campaign manager Matt Rhoades said. When asked about Romney's secretly recorded comments at a fundraiser where he said 47% of the country would not vote for him because they are ""dependent on government,"" officials said they did not know it existed. Immediately after it was released, campaign officials researched to see if there was any editing of the tape that changed what the candidate said. Then aides had to go into damage control mode. Analysis: Why Romney lost . Rhoades and others credited Romney for knowing he made a mistake and not blaming others. ""I remember speaking to him and there was a lot of negativity about our campaign as a whole, but he's a person who takes personal responsibility about it,"" Rhoades said. ""And he would tell me ... 'You didn't say 47%, Matt. Stuart (Stevens, Romney's senior campaign adviser) didn't say 47%. I did.' And obviously it was not a high moment for our campaign, but I think it speaks a lot to who Mitt Romney is, and I also like to think it speaks a lot to who this campaign team is that we're able to make a run and come back from that."" Rhoades discussed how the campaign was having problems in September after the Republican convention -- confronting stories of infighting -- but praised Romney, saying he never ""pushed through and plowed through."" Romney aides they ""never allowed ourselves to believe"" they had no chance of winning. Obama aides said the roughest point of their campaign was the president's performance in the first debate in Denver. David Axelrod, Obama's senior campaign adviser, told the panel that aides had purposely decided to avoid bringing up such issues as Romney's experience at Bain Capital or the 47% comments, but saw that strategy backfire. ""We had a strategy of limited engagement that we took to an illogical extreme,"" Axelrod said, a comment that was met by laughter from the attendees. ""What we assumed was that these guys, having practiced for as long as and as hard as they had, had an answer prepared, and we just felt like we were going to lead into something that may not be productive,"" he added. One key missed opportunity was when the Republican nominee said he had been in business for 25 years, didn't know about tax breaks for companies moving jobs overseas and that ""I maybe need to get a new accountant."" ""There were answers that we could have given. But it would have been more personal in nature,"" Axelrod observed. ""If there was a preparation problem, it was on that strategic level."" Obama engaged in more rigorous preparation for the second and third debates. One part of that was a focus on reaction shots, especially during the town hall forum where he would be on camera a lot. Other interesting items to emerge: . Florida, Florida, Florida: The Obama campaign had decided to wait until mid-September before deciding whether to fully commit financially to an ad campaign in Florida. Team Obama saw some encouraging poll numbers that showed the state competitive after the Democratic convention and dedicated $40 million. It was a ""big moment,"" campaign manager Jim Messina said, because it was one of the states the Republicans had to get back into their column in order to get the 270 electoral votes needed for election. The Bain attacks: Team Romney was aware that attacks on Romney's tenure at Bain Capital had been used in Romney's previous runs for office in 1994 and 2002, so the campaign in the fall of 2011 set up a task force headed by Bob White, one of his closest friends and also a former Bain executive, to be ready to answer any charges. When the pro-Newt Gingrich super PAC went up with Bain attacks in January during the Republican primaries, Rhoades said, the team had rebuttal information ready within 24 to 48 hours. While Rhoades said aides thought the attacks could come during the primaries, ""we were surprised a little by the intensity."" Mr. Preparation: Beth Myers, who directed Romney's debate preparation, said she wanted getting ready to debate the president to be the ""Manhattan Project"" of the campaign. The first general election debate prep came in June with policy sessions because officials knew this would be a good chance to give the campaign a jolt. There were policy and strategy sessions in June, July and August. Myers made sure Romney was armed with a research book for any cross-country trip. During the Democratic convention in early September, Romney went to debate camp doing five mock debates in three days. And for ""fun at night"" the aides would do whiteboard review sessions. Romney did 16 mock debates in total because those close to him knew that one way to help him relax was to make sure he was as prepared as possible. Rubio and Ryan in political spotlight .

"(CNN) -- Jenni Rivera. Add the Mexican-American superstar's name to a long list of beloved celebrities killed in the crash of a charter aircraft. That list includes singer/actress Aaliyah, golfer Payne Stewart and musicians Ronnie Van Zant, Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens. In 2008, Travis Barker of Blink-182 and Adam ""DJ AM"" Goldstein were critically injured -- and four other passengers were killed -- when their charter jet crashed on takeoff in South Carolina. Overall, the industry is overwhelmingly safe. Yet Sunday's crash in northern Mexico that killed Rivera and six others, including a pilot and co-pilot, has focused attention on charter safety. Related: Plane owner linked to troubled businessman . One red flag, experts say, is the 43-year-old plane's age. ""The Learjet is a pretty reliable airplane, but this one was really old,"" says Ladd Sanger, an attorney and licensed pilot who specializes in plane crashes. ""As a general rule, over 40 years old, and I think you need to be concerned."" However -- on its own -- age is not an indicator of an airplane's safety, says John McGraw. an ex-FAA deputy administrator. ""This plane was 10 minutes in flight, so you wouldn't expect that to be a factor in this type of accident,"" he said. In general, experts say travelers can reduce their risk of choosing a charter that's poorly run -- or even illegal -- by asking a few smart questions. Owner of plane in Jenni Rivera crash under DEA investigation . Pilots . Make sure the charter is well established and employs its own pilots, experts say. Leonard Goldberg is president and owner of Gold Aviation, a 17-year-old outfit based in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, that flies six aircraft. ""Our search process is very stringent,"" he says. ""We see dozens of candidates at least before we settle on a pilot, which is pretty common, for good quality operators."" The FAA doesn't impose age limits for charter pilots, although pilots for airliners and other commercial carriers must retire at age 64. Charter pilots must pass flight medical exams, which increase in frequency with age. FAA certificate . In the United States, ask to see the charter operator's FAA Part 135 air carrier certificate. It's what legally defines an operator as a charter carrier. ""It should be posted inside their building,"" Sanger says. Brokers . Be aware that if you use a broker instead of booking directly from a charter operator, you're putting your journey in the hands of a middleman. Critics call it ""jet roulette"" because you're essentially trusting the broker to hire a safe and legal charter plane. Maintenance . Ask charter operators if their firm performs its own aircraft maintenance. Find out if training for the charter company's mechanics is approved by the aircraft manufacturers. Safety audits . Many charters and brokers hire outside companies to oversee, rate and suggest improvements for their safety practices. Ask about safety audits. Insurance . Sanger says he has seen more than his share of illegal ""bootleg"" charter operations, and one way to easily smoke them out is to ask about their insurance liability. Depending on the value of the plane, Goldberg says look for a range between $5 million and $300 million. ""Get a copy of the policy,"" Sanger says.""If they don't have at least a $10 million policy and you're chartering a jet -- run."" The FAA does require charter companies to carry insurance. But it does not require insurance for non-charter private planes. That makes it very tempting, Sanger says, for private plane owners to rake in fat profits by pretending to be a legal charter operator. ""They need to pass a law that says you have to have insurance on any airplane, just like they do cars,"" he says. When contracting with a non-U.S. charter operator, it gets more complicated. Rules and regulations are different in every country, underscoring the importance of grilling the operator about maintenance, documentation and oversight. Appearances can mean a lot. ""Sometimes all you need to do is look at a plane to know you don't want to get on it,"" Sanger said. Deadly charter accidents increased in the United States last year, according to the FAA, up from six fatal accidents in 2010 to 16 in 2011, when pilots logged more than 3 million hours in flight. Deaths rose from 17 to 41. Worldwide so far this year, out of more than 17,600 business jets -- which include small private and charter planes -- there have been 12 major accidents and 25 deaths, according to the Flight Safety Foundation.

"Decatur, Georgia (CNN) -- Somber chords sounded at a funeral service Wednesday for a drum major whose death has sparked an investigation of hazing allegations at his Florida university. Criticisms of hazing and rallying cries for change echoed throughout the three-hour church ceremony. ""I call on every mother, every father, every niece, every uncle: Do what is necessary now to stop this tragedy so that it will never happen again,"" the Rev. John Tatum shouted into a microphone as he pointed at hundreds of people packed into the pews at Beulah Missionary Baptist Church in Decatur, Georgia. Authorities have not specified what caused 26-year-old drum major Robert Champion's death after a performance earlier this month with the Marching 100 band from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU). Officials said hazing was involved, and his family has said it plans to sue the school ""to get answers."" Speaking at Wednesday's service, FAMU President James H. Ammons pledged to ""wage a campaign to stomp out hazing on the campus at FAMU,"" drawing cheers and applause from the crowd. ""I vow as president of FAMU that Robert's death will not be in vain,"" Ammons said. Music and testimonials filled the service for Champion. A band performed from Southwest DeKalb High School, where Champion first became a drum major at the end of his sophomore year. As a recording of ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" from the soundtrack of the 2002 movie ""Drumline"" played, audience members stood and pantomimed performing the song on band instruments. A jazzy trumpet solo marked the funeral's final moments. Several speakers described Champion as a kind person and a strong leader who was dedicated to achieving his goals. ""Robert gave us his all every time that he took the field. ... Whenever Robert heard the sound of the drum, his knees raised, his toes pointed and he was on a mission to make the FAMU community proud,"" said Julian E. White, who has led the 420-member FAMU band since 1998. The university's president moved to fire White shortly after Champion's death, citing ""alleged misconduct and/or incompetence involving confirmed reports and allegations of hazing with the Department of Music and the 'Marching 100.'"" White has hired an attorney to fight for his job and has said he did everything he could to put a stop to hazing. White made no mention of the allegations at Wednesday's funeral. He said that he considered Champion a son and regretted not telling him he had been selected to be the band's next head drum major. ""I loved that young man. The world is a better place because of Robert Champion,"" he said. While uncertainty swirled over the hazing allegations, there was no doubt among mourners Wednesday that Champion was doing what he loved. A program distributed at the service showed several photos of him performing with FAMU's band. Inside the program, an obituary said Champion proclaimed his goal of becoming a drum major in the Marching 100 after seeing them perform when he was just 5 years old. His childhood next-door neighbor described memories of watching Champion marching around his yard. Mourners filing past the open coffin before Wednesday's service began saw Champion's body clad in the band's uniform, his hand holding a baton. A group of drum majors draped his coffin with the university's flag as the service began. Band members who attended FAMU decades ago were among those who attended the ceremony. Brian Joyner, 49, said after the service that Champion was kind and humble when they met at a recent homecoming game. The hazing allegations are ""baffling"" for many of the prestigious band's alumni, said Joyner, who was a drum major in the band in 1980. ""There's nothing I've heard of in 32 years where a drum major was required to go through any type of initiation,"" he said. He defended White, the band's longtime director. ""The rumors that you hear about Dr. White not being active and eradicating hazing, that's a lie,"" he said. Wednesday's service came two days after Champion's family said they would sue FAMU. ""We are concerned about the culture of cover-up, that hazing has been covered up...for generations,"" the family's lawyer, Chris Chestnut, said Monday. The medical examiner has not issued a report on the cause of death of the 26-year-old student. But, Chestnut said, evidence points ""to the fact that hazing was a cause of Robert Champion's death, and it was under FAMU's watch."" Champion became ill at an Orlando hotel after a football game on November 19. He reportedly vomited in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe, authorities said. Champion was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said last week that hazing was involved, but added that authorities were trying to determine an official cause of death. Under Florida law, any death that occurs as the result of hazing is a third-degree felony. After the death, Ammons suspended all band performances and said he would convene a task force ""to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the Marching 100.""","Hazing allegations are ""baffling,"" says FAMU band alumnus .

"(Oprah.com) -- When we found him, he was blind and soaking, slumped in an alleyway, clearly close to death. He struggled to stand, then listed to one side and collapsed again. We watched him for a moment, horrified. And then, because we couldn't just leave him there to die, we picked him up and brought him inside. We laid him gently on the white expanse of our kitchen counter. After the blurry dark of the monsoon outside, the kitchen felt as bright and quiet as an operating theater. My fiancé, Colin, placed him inside a robin's-egg-blue Tiffany box. We called him Tiffany, and then later, Mr. Tiffany—but most often, we called him Mr. T. That night, while I lay in our bedroom, hiding from the creature's inevitable death, Colin nursed him once an hour with eyedroppers of milk and energy drinks. He was a street rat, no more than a few days old. His life had begun in the grimy alley beside our apartment in Hong Kong, and to most people, he would have embodied filth and disease. But we saw instead a fragile, unknowable life, and in the three years that followed, we came to see him as no average soul. Oprah.com: How to help a homeless animal . Mr. T entered our world during a time of transition. Our wedding was three months away, and I was working seven days a week, often long into the night. My job as a foreign correspondent kept me in constant motion and took me around the world; even owning furniture seemed like a big commitment. I tried not to think about what that would mean for the future. Colin and I planned to have children someday, though some nights we could barely find time to have dinner. Taking in a half-dead rat that needed sustained attention just to survive hadn't been on my agenda. Which was why, when Colin and I found that Mr. T was miraculously still breathing the next morning, we vowed to set the rat free as soon as he'd recovered fully. He had survived, but he was a wild animal who deserved to live among his own kind. Not to mention that we had both read up on the extensive roster of virulent diseases rodents carry. Unwilling to get attached, I avoided him like, well, the plague. Still, as he gained strength over the following weeks, we couldn't help celebrating Mr. T's tiny milestones: the moment a week after we found him when he opened his eyes in Colin's palm, the night he lost his fear of our shiny floor tiles, the day he turned a bicycle into a jungle gym, his little black shrimp's eyes flashing in excitement as he clambered over its pedals and wheels. Oprah.com: 17 quotes that inspire us to change the world . Mr. T began to make himself at home, confiscating mail, pens, and whole pizza slices and dragging them under the sofa, then chewing a crawl space inside the sofa itself. It was clear he intended to settle in for the long haul. But could we really keep this animal? On the other hand, was it even feasible for Mr. T to reenter the wild? We called a professor at Oxford University who specialized in rat behavior. He told us that domesticated rats set free in the forest begin acting like wild rats within a few hours. There was nothing stopping us from bidding Mr. T adieu and moving on with our lives. Nothing except the fact that we couldn't resist his charms. Already, he'd begun to train us in his care. By knocking over his dinner dishes or leaving them untouched, he made it clear that most vegetables—carrots, green beans, peppers—were inedible unless drenched in butter. He would eat peas, but only when shelled; the tops, but never the stalks, of broccoli; blueberries, but only if cut in half. His favorite foods were mushroom pâté, sushi, and scrambled eggs. A few drops of beer were always appreciated. We prepared him two hot meals a day, which he ate with surgical precision, extracting the fattiest morsels first. He was too cute to let go. Oprah.com: 9 small dreams that can come true for anybody . Colin built Mr. T a five-story dwelling from wood and chicken wire, which we furnished with the cushions of the sofa he had destroyed. Mr. T compulsively redesigned his home, shredding the cushions and shoving bits of stuffing into the gaps in the chicken wire. Sometimes he would snuggle under my palm, pushing his nose into the V between my thumb and forefinger. If I tried to move away, he would grip my fingers with powder-pink, gummy-palmed paws. I began to see Hong Kong as a place teeming with more than just human life: the giant hoary moth wrapped around the corner of an office building, the bird squatting on the pavement outside a watch shop, the feral dogs that patrolled the area behind our apartment building. One afternoon, after noticing one of Mr. T's grubbier cousins in the same alley where we had found him, I realized that the line we draw between animals that are socially acceptable and those we find repugnant can be awfully arbitrary. As Mr. T steadily pawed his way into our hearts, Colin and I identified, for the first time in our lives, as parents. My husband was a rational and generous father, and I was a neurotic, fussy mom. Colin tried to see the world through Mr. T's eyes, adding a solid wooden door to Mr. T's home when he realized how much he liked his privacy, or adhesive sandpaper when he saw Mr. T slip on his ramps. Meanwhile, I obsessed over Mr. T's health, fearing that every nap or failed attempt to mount the coffee table signaled terminal illness. Oprah.com: One man, one mission: Rescuing mutts . I felt our world conforming to Mr. T's needs—and I loved it. Colin and I stopped going out to dinner as often and instead spent evenings in our living room, beaming proudly as Mr. T dragged apples and socks into his house with great seriousness. Some nights, we stayed up on the sofa until 2, 3, 4 in the morning, waiting for the nocturnal Mr. T to rouse himself and pad downstairs. We stopped traveling together so one of us could always be home to keep him company, and when that was impossible, we enlisted house sitters and left an instruction manual nearly an inch thick. At parties we matched our friends' tales of their children with news of Mr. T's latest tricks, his most recent fascinations: wooden knives and forks, starchy restaurant napkins, salmon sashimi. I posted photos on Facebook of Mr. T eating green beans, his tiny paws covered in tomato sauce, or Mr. T in repose, his whiskers a halo around his face. Oprah.com: Puppy love: Why raising a dog changes you . And all the while, we grappled with the fact that Mr. T didn't have much time. On the streets, most rats die before their first birthday. In captivity, many die by 3. Not long after he turned 2, Mr. T's once rapid pace slowed to a jog, then a waddle, and he began to sleep more solidly through the days. But he was determined to keep going. When, as I had often worried he might, he developed a tumor—it was as large as his head—we found a microsurgeon who removed it, and Mr. T sprinted across our living room the same day. When a spinal condition paralyzed his back legs, he adapted by pulling himself up and down the ramps with his front paws. One night Mr. T began to struggle to breathe. This time the surgeon couldn't save him. Mr. T died in Colin's hands. We had him cremated, and held a small ceremony in which we scattered some of his ashes in the park behind our apartment building so he could rest near his family. We put the remainder of his ashes in an urn, which we placed beside a picture of him in our living room, and tried to adjust to the sad fact that we didn't get to be Mr. T's mom and dad anymore. But shortly after his passing, Colin and I became parents to a son, whom we named Louis T. A few years earlier, we had struggled to find even a spare hour in the day—but Mr. T taught us how to make room in our lives for the future we wanted, to be more empathetic, more patient. He taught us to love unconditionally. We'd found Mr. T in one of life's interstices, between dating and marriage, coupledom and parenthood. If it had been a dog or a cat slumped in our alleyway that night, there would be no story to tell. We would have brought the animal to a shelter. Knowing that nobody would do that for Mr. T made us bring him into our home, and doing so made all the difference. Some of our friends and family just didn't get Mr. T. They never understood how we could love a rat. We never understood how, if you had the pleasure of meeting him, it was possible not to.Alexandra Harney is the author of ""The China Price"" (Penguin) and an expert on economic issues in Asia.

"(CNN) -- Australian novelist Julia Leigh's first film as writer-director was inspired by a dream she had. Or maybe it was a nightmare? Judging by the movie, it could have been a bit of both. Emily Browning -- the doll-like child actress from ""Lemony Snicket"" who graduated to the status of action-babe in ""Sucker Punch"" earlier this year -- plays Lucy, a college student who takes on a series of menial jobs over the course of the film, including waitress, lab rat, secretary and sex toy. In the brilliantly creepy first scene, she somehow refrains from retching as a lab researcher threads several feet of tubing down her throat. It's a strong indication that whatever else, Lucy has the willpower to dissociate mind from body -- to mentally switch off. This remains her defining characteristic throughout: a kind of abstention that serves her well in trying circumstances, but which also makes Lucy a frustratingly vague, ill-defined personality. With her pale skin and wide eyes, Browning has a particular pre-Raphaelite beauty that's oddly impassive. It's as if she's sleepwalking through the story -- or, perhaps, this is her own erotic/masochistic dream? Interviewed for another position by the immaculately coiffed and polished Clara (a chilly, regal Rachel Blake), Lucy uncomplainingly strips down to her undies for an intimate physical inspection. Clara apparently likes what she sees, and next thing you know Lucy is serving champagne to a dinner table of aristocrats who get their kicks by ignoring the near-naked servants. This proves to be something of an audition for a better-paid gig at Clara's country mansion, where rich old men pay handsomely for a night with a beautiful young girl. House rules permit anything short of actual penetration or physical harm. Meanwhile the girl is so heavily drugged she sleeps through the entire experience. Where's the fun in that, you might think? Is Leigh delving into the murky waters of female sexuality, or making a political point about exploitation and prostitution? Again, the movie seems to want to do both, though it doesn't go far enough down either route to reach any firm conclusions. Sticking with a mostly static camera and lengthy takes, Leigh seems to be shooting for the kind of slow, somber surrealism of Luis Bunuel's foray into similar subject matter, ""Belle de Jour"". But she's not that accomplished a director -- not yet, anyway -- and the film sometimes drifts into a stilted somnolence. Scenes of Lucy's everyday life away from work -- bickering with flat-mates, or caring for a dying friend -- fail to shed much light on the character or her motivations, and are shot in the same monotonous rhythm. More effective are the quietly ugly, anti-erotic chamber pieces: the one-sided encounters between the slumbering Lucy and the aging, all-but impotent clients. These scenes are emotionally and visually frank, shedding a hard, cold light on what men want from the opposite sex. In the end, there's enough here to make us see why Leigh felt compelled to turn her dream into a movie, even if this suggestive, frustratingly elusive effort is not an entirely pleasurable experience for the rest of us.","Emily Browning plays Lucy, a college student who takes on a series of menial jobs .

"Washington (CNN) -- An array of talents was on display Sunday at the Kennedy Center Honors gala where President Barack Obama toasted the lifetime achievements of an iconic ballerina, a famed comedian, a timeless actor and two chart-topping musical acts. In the 35th installment of the honorary event, late-night show host David Letterman, ballerina Natalia Makarova, actor Dustin Hoffman, blues musician Buddy Guy and the rock group Led Zeppelin joined the ranks of the top musicians, dancers and actors of their time. The festivities kicked off at a White House reception where Obama honored the award recipients and recounted highlights of their careers. ""Each of us can remember a moment when the people on this stage touched our lives. ... Maybe they inspired us to see things in a new way, to hear things differently."" Obama said. ""It is that unique power that makes the arts so important."" The Kennedy Center Honors has long been a tradition that bridges Hollywood and Washington, and this year was no exception. Aside from the honorees, other notable attendees included actors Alec Baldwin, Jack Black and Morgan Freeman; rockers Lenny Kravitz and Jeff Beck; and such politicians as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Thad Cochran of South Dakota and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. After the White House reception, the cadre of luminaries and guests moved to The Kennedy Center, a performing arts space overlooking the Potomac River, for an event dedicated to their respective talents. This is the fourth time Obama has honored Kennedy Center award recipients. Last year's group included singer Neil Diamond, composer Sonny Rollins, theater actor Barbara Cook, cellist Yo-Yo Ma and actress Meryl Streep. Read more: CNN honors heroes, Hollywood-style . While the 2011 pool of honorees had a noticeable music bent, the backgrounds in this year's group are more diverse but equally talented. Letterman, host of ""The Late Show"" on CBS, was recognized for his 30 years in late-night television and joined a small group of past comedians who have won the award. In a press release, Kennedy Center chairman David Rubenstein described Letterman, 65, as ""one of the most influential personalities in the history of television."" With more than 5,000 broadcasts, Letterman, holds the title as the comedian with the longest late-night career in the United States, recently surpassing the industry's previous standard-bearer, the late Johnny Carson. In his witty style, Letterman joked about learning he was an award recipient. ""When I stopped laughing, I was very excited. This was great for my family; they think I'm working at a Jiffy Lube in Mexico,"" he said on his program. Obama, someone who has been on Letterman's show a number of times, remarked at the White House reception that Letterman was ""a true gentleman"" who ""has always offered us an authentic piece of himself."" The president did joke, however, that not being in front of the microphone was a difficult position for the usually opinionated comedian. ""You are looking a little stressed, aren't you,"" Obama said to Letterman. Speaking to reporters on the red carpet before the event, Letterman expressed more surprise about the honor. ""I don't know what to tell you,"" he said. ""It just keeps getting better and better and better and I am not supposed to be here."" Asked if there's anything he was particularly looking forward to at the event, he pointed to his special ride home. ""Well, afterwards, we get joy rides in Marine One. That is going to be something."" Hoffman, meanwhile, has become a household name with a resume that includes 50 movies, not to mention two Academy Awards for Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) and Rain Man (1988). While the 75-year-old actor has said he grew up thinking movie stars had to look like Rock Hudson, it didn't take long for the Los Angeles native to get into acting and start a career that spans five decades and covers just about every genre of film. Many of his titles were featured in his tribute at the Kennedy Center, which is not far from the famous Watergate hotel -- a site he knows well after playing the ambitious reporter, Carl Bernstein, in ""All The President's Men"" (1976). Asked on the red carpet how he was feeling, the actor had a line all ready to deliver. ""My wife keeps reminding me that when I say, 'Pretty good -- I am a nominee,' she says 'No, you are an honoree.' So it is spectacular,"" he said. Russian-born Makarova is perhaps best known for leaving her mark on the production of La BayadÃ¨re, a ballet that dates to 1877. She transformed the scene ""Kingdom of the Shades,"" and went on to stage the full production in theaters around the world. Makarova, 72, is no stranger to the Kennedy Center. She won a Tony Award for best actress in a musical for the center's 1984 production of ""On Your Toes."" Makarova said before the gala that she considers American ballet ""fantastic,"" adding, ""I think it will grow and grow. The interest will never stop."" The audience Sunday night will also feel the rhythm in performances honoring blues legend Buddy Guy. Born into a Louisiana sharecropper family, Guy eventually made Chicago his home at the peak of the blues era in the Windy City. And with his distinct guitar sound, the six-time Grammy Award winner helped pioneer the electric blues with other legends including Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. ""From picking cotton in the field to picking a guitar in the White House, that is a long ways man,"" Guy told reporters at the Kennedy Center. The president called Guy ""one of the last guardians of the great American blues."" And the stage will continue to rock in a tribute to John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant -- the three surviving members of the band Led Zeppelin. Famed drummer John Bonham passed away in 1980. Having sold more than 100 million albums in the United States alone, the British band has churned out a number of classics, including ""Whole Lotta Love,"" ""Thank You,"" and the enduring song: ""Stairway to Heaven."" Though thanking the group for ""making us all feel young,"" Obama took the liberty of joking about the trio during his remarks in the East Room, noting how the group redefined ""the rock and roll lifestyle."" ""There were some hotel rooms trashed, mayhem all around,"" the president said. ""So it is fitting that we are doing this in a room with windows three inches thick."" ""So guys, settle down, these paintings are valuable,"" Obama joked. Asked on the red carpet if part of him wanted to get on stage and join the tribute, Plant said, ""Absolutely."" ""I've always got a little bit of agitation in me,"" he continued. ""That's what keeps me going. But I'm not going to show anybody how to do it."" The trio is scheduled to join fellow honoree Letterman on the ""The Late Show"" on Monday. The Kennedy Center Honors will air December 26 on CBS.","Obama welcomes honorees at White House reception .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and his South Korean counterpart hit the road together Friday, traveling to the heart of America's Rust Belt to tout a recently approved trade deal between Washington and Seoul. Obama also used the occasion to defend his controversial 2009 bailout of the U.S. auto industry, which has shown recent signs of recovery. Obama and President Lee Myung-bak visited Orion Township, Michigan -- on the outskirts of Detroit -- to visit a General Motors assembly plant. GM, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, got federal funding to help with its reorganization. The plant, which now produces the new Chevrolet Sonic subcompact, was set to shut down during GM's bankruptcy restructuring. But the plant's subcompact expertise -- along with a joint venture with GM Korea -- saved the facility and its 1,750 jobs. The trade deal is ""a win-win"" for America and South Korea, Obama told a crowd of cheering workers at the plant. ""We live in a global economy. ... The more goods and services we sell abroad, the more jobs we create here at home."" This deal ""will not take away any of your jobs,"" Lee declared. ""This is the pledge I give you today."" The two leaders also hailed the new trade deal at a White House dinner Thursday. Congress approved the agreement on Wednesday -- along with deals with Panama and Colombia -- on a bipartisan basis. Administration officials contend the South Korean deal alone with boost U.S. exports by up to $11 billion while supporting 70,000 American jobs. ""We believe in American ingenuity,"" Obama said Friday. ""Most importantly, we believe in American workers."" Partly as a result of the auto bailout, Detroit ""is a city where a great American industry is coming back to life,"" Obama added.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- At least 10,000 marchers shut down the center of the Greek capital Wednesday to protest the latest waves of austerity measures announced by the government. The march accompanied a one-day strike in the public sector that shut down Athens International Airport, government ministries and schools. Hospitals operated on skeleton staffs, and some commuter rail services were closed. The marchers shouted slogans against the government and the threesome overseeing Greece's $146 billion bailout: the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund. The protesters were unionized public sector workers, angry at the pay cuts they have suffered which, they say, amount to as much as 40% of take-home pay. The best paid 100,000 public sector workers will lose another 20% of their pay, the finance ministry recently announced. State workers are also worried about impending layoffs. Earlier this week the government announced it would retire 30,000 people in a bid to cut 300 million euros in operating costs next year. The 2012 budget, which was handed to parliament on Monday, contains a further $6.7 billion dollars' worth of spending cuts. Public sector unions fear that many of those savings will come from layoffs. The latest cuts are a bid by the Greek government to qualify for the sixth installment of its bailout plan, worth some $10.6 billion. Without the money, the government can only pay salaries and pensions until mid-November. Greece's finance minister on Sunday told the cabinet that the country would fall short of its deficit target this year by $2 billion. The reason, he said, is that the economy has shrunk by 5.5%, far more than the 3.8% originally forecast. ""We are forced to take decisions much faster than we would wish,"" Prime Minister George Papandreou told the cabinet. Greece's deficit this year will be 18.69 billion euros ($24.9 billion), or 8.5% of GDP, as opposed to the originally forecast 17.1 billion euros ($22.77 billion) or 7.8%. The government will aim to achieve a 2012 deficit of 14.65 billion euro ($19.51 billion) or 6.8% of GDP, by combining 2011 and 2012 goals. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos believes this will give Greece a primary surplus next year of 3.2 billion euros ($4.2 billion). The government's cashflow problems are disrupting education. The school year began on September 12, but the education ministry was embarrassed to admit that it still hadn't printed textbooks. Those are still being run off the presses and the ministry expects to have delivered all of them by the end of October. In the meantime, angry high school students staged sit-ins at their schools. On Tuesday, 540 of the country's 11,000 high schools were shut down as a result. Wednesday's marchers included many of those students.","March accompanies one-day strike that shuts down Athens International Airport, schools .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Free trade, transparency and a crackdown on tax cheats will be at the heart of Britain's G8 presidency, Prime Minister David Cameron told the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday as he set out his vision for a more competitive Europe. The speech comes a day after Cameron made headlines by promising the British people a vote on European Union membership if he wins the next general election in 2015. ""We need more free trade. We need fairer tax systems. We need more transparency on how governments -- and yes, companies -- operate,"" Cameron told political and business leaders at Davos. These three issues will be the focus of the G8 meeting to be hosted by Britain later this year, he said. Cameron said the European Union and the G8 -- made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain and the United States -- all face the ""looming, insistent question"" of how to compete and succeed in the global economic race. He sees free trade as key to that success, saying that when it isn't free, everyone suffers. He wants Britain to be outward-looking, Cameron said, as he insisted that his referendum promise was ""not about turning our backs on Europe"" but about making the 27-member bloc work for everyone. ""Let's negotiate a new settlement for Europe that works for the UK and then let's get fresh consent for it. It's not just right for the UK. It's necessary for Europe,"" he said. ""Europe is being out-competed and out-invested -- and it's time we make it an engine for growth, not a source of cost for business and complaint for our citizens."" 'Shape the future' With this in mind, Cameron told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he has no regrets over the referendum promise, despite unhappiness among some European partners. ""It's really important that we've set out a plan for how we get change in Europe that will benefit all of Europe, making it more open, more competitive, more flexible, and how we secure Britain's place within that,"" he said. ""I think it's a very important step forward and I'm pleased with the reception that the speech has got from the business community, from the public, and also some positive responses from some of my European colleagues in government, too."" As for those who have criticized the decision, Cameron said he believes ""the greatest gamble for Britain would be to sit back and do nothing."" The European Union is already changing to meet the needs of the 17 members who are part of the euro single currency, he said. Britain is not in that group. ""It's much better in my view to step forward to shape that debate, to shape the future in Europe,"" he said. Britain's desire to renegotiate the terms of its EU membership is based on the need to gain the consent of the people as they follow a path within Europe, he said. Far from being isolationist, Britain is a ""very positive player"" in the European Union, Cameron added. In addition to helping create the single market, it has been one of the nations that pushed for the oil embargo on Iran and tough sanctions on Syria, and it has become a key backer in recent days of France's military action in Mali, he said. Asked about the recent wrangling in the United States over the fiscal cliff, Cameron suggested that America could learn from Britain, although he recognizes that every country's circumstances are different. ""I would say our experience in the United Kingdom is that you can take people with you as you take those difficult decisions, but ... it's a very tough and hard road, but it's a road we all have to travel,"" he said. ""In the end, we all have to prove that we can pay our way in the world, that our credit is good, and all the rest of it. It's not the only way that you will get growth; it is part of what we need to bring the world economy back to healthy growth."" Cameron said the biggest thing that Britain and America could do together is to work on an EU-U.S. trade deal. ""Between us, we account for a third of world trade, so if we really got together and liberalized trade between the European Union and the United States of America, we could make both our peoples a lot better off,"" he said. 'Ethical issues' Addressing policymakers in Davos, Cameron said the questions of fairer taxes, more open trade and greater transparency apply just as much to the developed countries of the G8 as to poorer nations. And he dismissed the idea that speaking out on the issue of taxes and transparency made him anti-capitalism or anti-business. Poor practice by some firms has an impact on those that play by the rules, he said. There is a difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance, he added, ""but there are some forms of avoidance (that) have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these raise ethical issues, and it's time to call for more responsibility and for governments to act accordingly."" ""I'm a 'low tax' Conservative but I'm not a 'companies should pay no tax' Conservative,"" added Cameron, who heads Britain's Conservative Party. Meanwhile, transparency about the flow of money is key to poorer countries moving from poverty to growth, Cameron said. ""Like everything else in this G8, the ambitions are big, and I make no apology for that,"" he said. ""We can be the generation that eradicates absolute poverty in our world,"" he said, but only if leaders focus on the cause, not the symptoms. CNN's Richard Quest said Cameron's attempt to go after tax cheats could be seen as good populist politics and an easy shot as he tries to distract from other matters. No cherry-picking . On Wednesday, Cameron promised that if his party wins the 2015 general election, the country would get to vote on whether Britain stays in the European Union on the basis of a renegotiated deal, or leaves. The referendum should not be held until it's clear how changes made after the crisis in the eurozone works out, he said, but will be held in the first half of the next parliament. The long-awaited speech was met with approval by those in his party who want to see Britain get some powers back from the EU, as well as a reduction in legislation they say holds back businesses. But critics -- including his party's coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats -- say now is not the time to create uncertainty among businesses and industry over Britain's future in the European Union. It is also unclear whether the other 26 members of the European Union would be willing to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership. France and others have made it clear that the British leader cannot ""cherry-pick"" which elements of the EU he signs up to, or risk unraveling the union to suit British interests. U.S. President Barack Obama has also said that ""the United States values a strong UK in a strong European Union."" But German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave Cameron some room for maneuver, indicating she is open to discussions on a ""fair compromise."" She is also due to give a speech Thursday at Davos, the annual forum that this year is attended by nearly 40 world leaders and more than 2,000 executives. Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, speaking at Davos Wednesday, predicted Britain would remain in the EU. ""I am confident that if there is to be a referendum one day, the UK citizens will decide to stay in the EU and contribute to shape its future,"" he said. He added, however, ""I think the EU does not need unwilling Europeans."" Britain is a net contributor to the European Union and an important player in the single market, which may give Cameron some additional sway. But critics warn he is taking a big gamble. Former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, who leads the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament, warned against trying ""hold the EU to ransom."" CNN's Irene Chapple reported from Davos, and Laura Smith-Spark from London .","NEW: David Cameron says the United States could learn from Britain on deficit reduction .

"(CNN) -- The United States must position itself to lead in a world ""where security is shaped in boardrooms and on trading floors -- as well as on battlefields,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will say Friday in a major economics and foreign policy speech in New York. Economic forces, Clinton will say, are transforming foreign policy realities around the globe. ""We have seen governments toppled by economic crisis,"" a text of the Secretary's remarks released by the State Department on the eve of the speech reads. ""Revolutions born in a Tunisian marketplace have swept across an entire region. Europe faces its strongest test in a generation, thanks to recession and debt. And everywhere I travel, I see countries gaining influence not because of the size of their armies, but because of the growth of their economies."" Clinton will say she is updating U.S. foreign policy priorities to include economics ""every step of the way,"" suggesting the United States should take a cue from the leaders of emerging powers like India and Brazil who put economics at the center of their foreign policies. ""When their leaders approach a foreign policy challenge -- just as when they approach a domestic challenge -- one of the first questions they ask is, 'how will this affect our economic growth?'"" the text of the speech says. ""We need to be asking the same question -- not because the answer will dictate our foreign policy choices, but because it must be a significant part of the equation."" In the address before the Economic Club of New York, the fourth in a series of speeches Secretary Clinton is giving on economics and foreign policy, she will say the world's ""strategic and economic center of gravity is shifting east"" and the United States is focusing more on the Asia-Pacific region. ""One of America's great successes of the past century was to build a strong network of relationships and institutions across the Atlantic,"" she says. ""One of our great projects in this century will be to do the same across the Pacific."" The United States should help other countries find economic solutions to strategic challenges, especially in the Middle East and North Africa, she says. ""We need a sophisticated effort to integrate the region's economies, promote investment and assist in economic modernization. The Arab political Awakening must also be an economic awakening."" Clinton takes aim at Americans who would turn inward, arguing ""you can't call 'time out' in the global economy. Our competitors aren't taking a time out, and neither can we."" Increasingly, the United States is focusing on ""tracking and thwarting"" the financiers of terrorism, using sanctions and other economic tools to cut repressive regimes off from insurance, banking and shipping, Clinton says. Finally, Clinton says, the United States is ""modernizing (its) agenda on trade, investment and commercial diplomacy to deliver jobs and growth for the American people."" But the United States cannot compete, she says, if it is frozen in domestic political fights. ""Washington has to end the culture of political brinksmanship -- which, I can tell you, is raising questions around the world about our leadership.""","Clinton will speak to the Economic Club of New York .
The global economic center is shifting east, she says .
The United States must build relations across the Pacific ."
"New York (CNN) -- A New York district attorney recommended Monday that charges be dropped against former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was accused more than three months ago of sexually assaulting a hotel housekeeper. In ""a recommendation for dismissal"" filed in court Monday, two prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney's office laid out their arguments for requesting that numerous charges -- including attempted rape and sexual assault -- be dismissed, citing fresh evidence and questions about the accuser's credibility. ""The nature and number of the complainant's falsehoods leave us unable to credit her version of events beyond a reasonable doubt, whatever the truth may be about the encounter between the complainant and the defendant,"" the document states. ""If we do not believe her beyond a reasonable doubt, we cannot ask a jury to do so."" The prosecutors voiced concern that the case appeared to rest exclusively on the housekeeper Nafissatou Diallo, predicting her ""falsehoods"" would be ""devastating"" if revealed during a trial. They claim she ""has not been truthful in matters great and small,"" including lying about a ""gang rape, as well as other details about her life in (her native) Guinea."" In the document, the district attorney's office notes that DNA testing indicated semen on her dress matched Strauss-Kahn and shows there was a sexual encounter. There was ""no trauma to her body or oral cavity"" and ""scrapings from underneath her fingernails ... yielded no results."" Moreover, prosecutors claim Diallo's current story of her ""prompt outcry to her first supervisor is inconsistent with certain aspects of that supervisor's account."" ""All of the evidence that might be relevant to the contested issues of force and lack of consent is simply inconclusive,"" wrote the prosecutors. The decision to drop charges -- which still needs to be approved by a judge -- was cheered by Strauss-Kahn's attorney and jeered by the alleged victim's lawyer, as well as some women's rights advocates. A status hearing for the case is scheduled for Tuesday. Kenneth Thompson, who represents Diallo, addressed reporters after meeting with prosecutors Monday afternoon for less than half an hour. Hours earlier, he filed his own motion asking a judge to halt proceedings in the case and appoint a special prosecutor. ""Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has denied the right of a woman to get justice in a rape case,"" Thompson said. ""He has not only turned his back on this innocent victim, but he has also turned his back on the forensic, medical and other evidence in this case. ""If the Manhattan district attorney, who is elected to protect our mothers, our daughters, our sisters, our wives and our loved ones, is not going to stand up for them when they're raped or sexually assaulted, who will?"" But Strauss-Kahn's U.S.-based attorneys, William W. Taylor and Benjamin Brafman, lauded the decision to drop charges, saying it vindicates their consistent claims that their client is innocent and his accuser ""was not credible."" ""Mr. Strauss-Kahn and his family are grateful that the District Attorney's office took our concerns seriously and concluded on its own that this case cannot proceed further,"" the attorneys said in a statement. Aside from the court filing, there was no immediate comment from the office of District Attorney Vance on the attorneys' statements, and his office earlier declined to comment on the motion. Thompson had said before the meeting Monday that he believed Vance was going to drop the charges. A grand jury indicted the then-IMF chief in May over allegations he sexually assaulted housekeeper Diallo in his New York hotel suite. He pleaded not guilty and, after several days behind bars, was ordered held on house arrest. But on July 1, a judge freed him after prosecutors learned Diallo had lied about the specifics of her whereabouts after the incident and past details of an asylum application and information on tax forms. Prosecutors said she admitted lying on the asylum application about having been a victim of a gang rape, even providing details of an attack and later admitting it never happened. Strauss-Kahn's attorneys have insisted that any sexual encounter was consensual. Diallo, who has conducted high-profile interviews about the case, and her attorneys have said Strauss-Kahn attacked her, and that her case should go to trial. Attorneys for Diallo complain she is being treated by prosecutors like a criminal defendant and not an alleged victim. And in a rally after the district attorney's court filing Monday, some of her supporters urged prosecutors to still pursue the case and warned about the message sent by dropping charges. ""Are we telling (sexual assault victims) that if they dare to name a powerful, politically connected man as their abuser, they will see their whole life laid out to be judged publicly?"" asked New York City councilwoman Letitia James. ""What does it take for a low-income immigrant -- a woman of color -- to publicly name one of the most powerful men in Europe as a sexual abuser?"" Diallo has filed a civil lawsuit against Strauss-Kahn, without specifying the financial damages she was seeking. Entering Monday's meeting, Thompson said he suspected -- based on the contents of a letter he received Friday -- that Vance intended to drop charges. That prompted the alleged victim's motion filed Monday, which cites allegations of ""abuse of confidence, unfair treatment and bias and prejudices"" by Vance that, Diallo's attorneys claim, should disqualify him from the case. This motion is Thompson's second effort to remove Vance from the case. In July, he asked Vance to step down and appoint a special prosecutor. Vance then declined. ""This is not a 'he said, she said' case,"" Thompson said Sunday. ""If you go back to the hearing on May 16, when (an assistant district attorney) called the evidence against Strauss-Kahn 'substantial' and he said the medical exam (of Diallo) supports her account, this is not a 'he said, she said' case. ""There is overwhelming evidence to support that a sex assault occurred,"" Thompson said. After Diallo took her case public, Strauss-Kahn's attorneys, William Taylor and Benjamin Brafman, put out a statement saying, ""Ms. Diallo is the first accuser in history to conduct a media campaign to persuade a prosecutor to pursue charges ... against a person from whom she wants money."" Attorney Douglas Wigdor, who is working on Diallo's behalf in Paris, said Monday that he was to meet with several people prior to a news conference scheduled for Tuesday. Wigdor would not reveal with whom he is talking Monday and Tuesday, however a source familiar with the meetings said one of them is a French journalist, Tristane Banon, who filed a formal complaint against Strauss-Kahn in France for an alleged attack in 2002. The accused has filed a counter-suit for slander. Banon's mother also claims she was attacked by Strauss-Kahn. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says that Strauss-Kahn should now be able to breathe easier and ""return to some semblance of his former life."" But he said that no one involved in the case ""comes out of it looking very good."" ""This is a case that looks like it has nothing but losers -- the alleged victim, the defendant, and the prosecutor,"" Toobin said. ""The conclusion is likely to be entirely satisfying to no one.""","NEW: The DA says evidence related to ""force and lack of consent"" is ""inconclusive""

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi continued his record goalscoring streak by taking his tally to 88 for the year. The Barcelona striker scored both goals in his side's 2-0 win at Cordoba in the Copa del Rey as Tito Vilanova's team continued its stunning start to the season. The Catalan side, which lifted the trophy in Pep Guardiola's final game in charge last season, has won the competition on 26 occasions and looks in good shape to defend its title. Messi makes case as world's greatest ever player . Barca has won 14 and drawn one of its league games so far this season and has only suffered one defeat, which came in the European Champions League at Celtic. But with Messi firing on all cylinders, it is difficult to imagine which team can prevent Barca from regaining the league title from Real Madrid. Messi beats Muller's 40-year goal record . Only last week, Messi surpassed Gerd Muller's record of 85 goals in a calendar year, which was set back in 1972 by the former Germany and Bayern Munich striker. Messi, 25, has two games remaining this year to set the bar even higher with La Liga fixtures against Atletico Madrid and Valladolid to come before the end of 2012. Already his club's leading goalscorer after moving past the 232 mark set by Cesar Rodriguez in the 1950s, the Argentine continues to defy belief. His two goals against Cordoba means he has now scored 32 times in all competitions for club and country this season. Messi has also scored 15 goals in his past eight starts for Barca to ensure his team remains unbeaten in domestic competition. Playing against a Cordoba team, which is ranked below Barcelona's B team in the second division, Messi could have had three or four goals. Messi map: How Argentine maestro conquered the world . After tapping home from close-range on 11 minutes, the striker was denied on three occasions by Cordoba goalkeeper Mikel Saizar. Messi eventually added his second of the evening with 16 minutes remaining. He will now go up against Atletico Madrid hot-shot Radamel Falcao on Sunday with both men in fine form. Falcao scored five in his side's 6-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna last weekend and has netted 16 times in La Liga so far this season. But the Colombian hot-shot was reduced to a watching role as his side eased to a 3-0 win over Getafe in the first leg of their fifth round tie. Diego Costa struck twice and Filipe Luis was also on target as Atletico claimed a hefty advantage. Cristiano Ronaldo and Daniel Craig- A right to privacy? While Messi had an enjoyable evening, his chief rival for the Ballon d'Or, Cristiano Ronaldo, endured a frustrating night as Real Madrid was beaten 2-1 at Celta Vigo. The defending champion rested a number of players for the first leg tie and was made to pay the price as Celta claimed a deserved victory. Mario Bermejo opened the scoring on 56 minutes before substitute Cristian Bustos unleashed a spectacular winner to net his first goal in 110 appearances. Real had several chances to make the breakthrough against a Celta team ranked 15th in La Liga and finally grabbed a consolation when Ronaldo fired home with three minutes remaining. That away goal leaves Jose Mourinho's side needing just a 1-0 win to progress to the next round, where it could meet either Osasuna or Valencia. Messi and Ronaldo battle for Ballon d'Or . Elsewhere, there was embarrassment for last season's finalist Athletic Bilbao after it was knocked out of the competition by minnow Eibar. Eibar, which plays in the third division, had held the might of Athletic to a goalless draw in the first leg of the fourth round clash. And it completed an historic triumph after claiming a 1-1 draw at the San Mames to triumph on away goals and set up a last-16 clash with Malaga. Meanwhile, Sevilla claimed an impressive 5-0 win at Real Mallorca in the first leg of its Copa del Rey tie. Spain international Alvaro Negredo scored twice with Gary Medel, Alberto Botia and Antonio Manuel Luna also on target. In Italy, Juventus claimed a 1-0 win over Cagliari in the Coppa Italia thanks to Sebastian Giovinco's 56th minute strike. The game marked the return of Antonio Conte to the touchline after he recently completed a four-month ban for his alleged role in a match-fixing affair at former club Siena. Elsewhere, Catania won 4-3 on penalties following a 1-1 draw at Parma. Arsenal stunned by Bradford City in League Cup . In the English League Cup, Swansea booked its place in the semifinals for the very first time in its history following a 1-0 win over Middlesbrough. The Welsh club, which is managed by former Barcelona and Real Madrid player Michael Laudrup, joins Aston Villa and fourth-tier Bradford City in the next round with either Leeds or Chelsea set to make up the numbers. In France, league leaders Lyon moved three points clear at the top, despite being held to a surprise tie by relegation-threatened Nancy. It was Nancy which took the lead through Jordan Loties and the visitor looked set to win for the first time since the opening day. But Michel Bastos struck an 83rd minute equalizer to ensure Lyon took a point. Meanwhile, Marseille moved to within three points of the summit following a 2-1 win at Bastia in a game played behind closed doors. Following trouble in Bastia's home game with Corsican rivals Ajaccio in October, the game was played without any supporters in the stadium. Mathieu Valbuena's 15th-minute volley and an Andre Ayew penalty sealed the win with Anthony Modeste grabbing a consolation for Bastia. Elsewhere, Lorient made it four wins from its past five games with a 2-0 triumph over Sochaux courtesy of strikes from Alain Traore and Lamine Kone. Evian moved out of the relegation zone thanks to Cedric Barbosa's double in a 2-0 win over Troyes. Montpellier came from behind to see off Brest 2-1, while Ajaccio claimed a 2-0 victory over Reims.","Lionel Messi scores twice to take his goal tally to 87 for 2012 .

"London (CNN) -- Passengers struggling to get away for the holiday season faced further frustration and delays Tuesday, as the EU's top travel official slammed snow disruptions across the region as ""unacceptable."" Heavy snow caused severe disruption to train and plane schedules in a number of major cities days before Christmas, forcing thousands of people to sleep in terminals while they waited for information on their onward journey. ""I am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across Europe caused by severe snow. It is unacceptable and should not happen again,"" European Commission Vice President Siim Kallas said in a written statement. He took issue with airport infrastructure which he said was the ""weak link"" in the chain, and urged airports to ""get serious"" about planning for severe weather conditions.  Have you been affected? Send photos, video . Thousands of passengers endured another frustrating day at London's Heathrow Airport Tuesday as airlines struggled to clear the backlog of passengers after two days of cancellations. Only one of the airport's two runways was operating, following cancellations during the previous two days due to heavy snow. Kylie Deegennars said she had been sleeping on the terminal floor since arriving at Heathrow late on Saturday. ""We got told on that evening that if we wanted until 6 a.m. the next morning we'd get more information. We did not get a blanket or a bottle of water until 1.30 a.m. in the morning,"" she said. Conditions hadn't improved since then and Monday night she was still waiting for confirmation of a flight. ""We're younger, we've got resistance, but there are babies, there are elderly people, and they're getting no extra treatment than anyone else. It's disgusting,"" she said. On Tuesday afternoon, British Airways announced that it was considering transporting passengers stranded at Heathrow by bus to other UK airports. Terminal five, it said, had been closed as staff worked to clear the backlog of people crowding the main concourse. London Heathrow is to remain open for the next 24 hours, British Airways said, adding that it was considering bringing planes back overnight to clear the load. The airline said London's Gatwick terminal was ""congested but not unmanageable."" Colleagues Sharon and Cathy were trying to get back to Phoenix, Arizona after suffering a two-day delay to their flights from Munich, Germany. They have been stranded at Heathrow airport since Monday. ""We really felt that we were flying into the eye of the storm and it didn't make much sense to do that, but here we are. We've been told our best chance of getting out is on December 27,"" Sharon said. The colleagues say they are ""lucky"" to be put up in a hotel by their company, and expressed sympathy for others stranded in the airport with little or no information, accommodation or money. ""It looks like a refugee camp. People have been staying there for days. There were guards at the doors of Terminal one not allowing other people to come in. We were a little concerned about leaving the terminal that we might not be able to get back in,"" Sharon said. The British government has come under fire for failing to heed warnings about the incoming inclement weather. Defending the government, UK Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said, ""Nobody foresaw the really extreme temperatures that we've had."" He laid the blame for chaos at Heathrow Airport firmly at the door of airport operator BAA who he said made a ""bad call"" on Saturday when the snow first started to present problems. ""This is as a result of extreme weather conditions and also to be frank of a bad call on Saturday by the airport operator who was, as it turned out, over-optimistic about their ability to leave the airport open,"" he said. The government had offered military manpower to help clear runways which had been rejected, Hammond said. He added that the government was working with authorities to ensure the smooth supply of de-icing equipment and other materials to keep the airport operating. British transport expert David Quarmby, author of an independent audit on the resilience of England's transport system, said that the country could not be expected to be able to cope as well as other cities that regularly experience heavy snowfall. ""We had a severe winter last winter and a bit of a winter the year before. But for eight years before that we hardly saw any snow at all,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to justify investing in the resources that you find in airports and rail systems and highways in countries elsewhere which always have winters that are as severe as the one that we've got at the moment."" The travel disruption was not limited to airports. Long queues snaked around St. Pancras International railway station in London Tuesday as Eurostar canceled 10 trains, or about 20 percent its normal service between London and Paris. ""Due to the continuing bad weather, speed restrictions are in place on our high speed lines, adding up to two hours to journey times. As a result we can not operate as many trains as planned,"" said Eurostar spokeswoman Mary Walsh. Passengers ignored advice to turn up at the station one hour before departure. Some queued for as long as four hours in the London drizzle before stepping foot inside the terminal. During the wait, they were offered pizza, curry, coffee and tea, according to CNN's Jim Boulden. Earlier, hundreds of passengers camped at Paris train stations, including Eurostar's Paris terminal, Monday night while they waited news of the next train, French transport minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet told French radio Tuesday. Around 3,000 passengers on cancelled flights slept on the floor at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, while another 400 spent the night at Orly airport, she said. Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, CEO of Air France KLM said efforts had been made to find stranded passengers a hotel room. ""We found 4,000, but we couldn't find anymore,"" Gourgeon told French radio. A message on the Paris airports website said air traffic was ""slowly resuming"" after severe snow disruptions. Passengers were advised to check whether their flights had been cancelled before traveling to the airport. Heavy snowfall halted all plane travel at Frankfurt airport in Germany for a short time Tuesday, said Thomas Uber, an airport spokesman. By mid-morning in Europe, the number of canceled flights had risen to 464, mostly due to backlogs and disruptions at other airports, an official said. About 50 flights had been canceled at Munich airport, also due to disruptions elsewhere. German Transport Minster Peter Ramsauer has asked German state authorities to allow night flights on a case-by-case basis to ease travel chaos at airports. Major German airports have restrictions on night flights usually from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. and only allow night flights on a very limited basis or in cases of emergencies. On Tuesday afternoon Belgian authorities had started putting passengers whose flights had been diverted from Heathrow Airport to Brussels on coaches and boats to London. In a statement posted on its website, the airport advised passengers bound for Frankfurt on Lufthansa flights to make their way independently by train or car. European Commission Vice President Siim Kallas said he would convene a meeting of European airport representatives in coming days to demand an explanation and assurances that they can handle future snow disruptions. ""We have seen in recent years that snow in Western Europe is not such an exceptional circumstance. Better preparedness, in line with what is done in Northern Europe is not an optional extra, it must be planned for and with the necessary investment, particularly on the side of the airports,"" he said. The UK's Met Office says it is not expecting further snow in London Wednesday and that Heathrow and Gatwick airports ""should remain dry.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government claims he's the mastermind of a huge online fraud operation with multiple identities and a history of breaking the law and evading arrest, but his lawyer says he's a law-abiding entrepreneur committed to raising his young family in New Zealand. The question is which of these descriptions of Kim Dotcom, the founder of the shuttered file-sharing website Megaupload, is closer to the truth? Arrested by the New Zealand police in a raid last week, Dotcom is one of seven people indicted by the U.S. on accusations of operating an ""international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works."" Megaupload's lawyers denied the charges, and online activists have rallied to the site's defense. The arrests and the shuttering of Megaupload prompted an angry reaction from the activist hacking collective Anonymous, which took credit for temporarily crippling the U.S. Department of Justice, FBI and entertainment company websites after the prosecution was announced. Dozens of supporters attended Dotcom's court hearings in New Zealand this week. As he sits in jail awaiting an extradition hearing in the coming months, attention has focused on the extravagant lifestyle he appears to have enjoyed. The U.S. authorities say Megaupload generated more than $175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships. The New Zealand news media appear fascinated by the new international celebrity, and the government is facing questions over why it granted him residency in the country despite his criminal record. Judge D.J. McNaughton denied Dotcom bail and offered insights into his different descriptions. Dotcom holds one German passport, under the name of Kim Schmitz, and two Finnish passports, under the names of Kim Tim Jim Vestor and Kim Dotcom. Prosecutors say the multiple passports, as well as bank accounts and credit cards from various countries linked to different names prove that Dotcom presented a flight risk. His lawyers have countered that Dotcom thought the Finnish passport under the name of Kim Tim Jim Vestor had been canceled, and that the reason he had 25 credit cards in his possession at the time of his arrest was that he is a ""collector"" of credit cards. Most of the cards had expired, according to the defense lawyers. He has prior convictions from 1998 related to computer hacking, from 2003 for insider trading in Germany and from 2011 for failure to disclose the number of shares he acquired in Hong Kong. Dotcom is a resident of New Zealand, where he employs more than 50 staff, and Hong Kong, where he has a suite at the Grand Hyatt Hotel. He is married to a Filipina woman with whom he has three children. His wife is pregnant with twins, and he is also the legal guardian of his wife's two brothers ages 11 and 14. His lawyer, Paul Davison, argued the facts demonstrate his commitment to staying in New Zealand, where he obtained residency status in December 2009. But prosecutors and the judge have expressed concern that if Dotcom were able to make his way to Germany, his German nationality would make him immune from extradition proceedings. In his judgment Wednesday, McNaughton said he could not exclude the possibility that with his ""business effectively shut down in the United States and his bank accounts and assets frozen and facing prosecution on serious charges with the full weight of the United States government behind it"" that Dotcom ""may take whatever money is still available to him and run to safe haven in Germany."" The judge also expressed concern about the existence of a firearm found near Dotcom at the time of his arrest last week. The New Zealand police used helicopters to storm Dotcom's mansion. He reacted by activating a ""sophisticated security lock on his bedroom door and then retreating to a second 'panic room' hidden within his bedroom again secured by a security locked door,"" according to prosecutors. When the police entered the inner room, they found Dotcom sitting cross-legged on the floor and ""a loaded shotgun in a nearby safe."" Dotcom has admitted he doesn't hold a firearm license but says he was intending to apply for one. His lawyer argued that the presence of guns on the property was a precautionary measure because his wife is from the Philippines where the kidnapping of wealthy individuals or their children is a common occurrence. It was also disclosed in court that Dotcom suffers from diabetes and hypertension. He has also been receiving treatment for a slipped disc. All reasons, his lawyers said, for not keeping him in custody.","Kim Dotcom is the founder of Megaupload, a site shut down by the U.S. last week .

"(CNN) -- Zambia coach Herve Renard has dedicated the country's first Africa Cup of Nations title to former player Kalusha Bwalya, who escaped a plane crash that killed the squad of 1993. Bwalya, regarded as one of Zambia's greatest players, is also head of the country's soccer federation. He was in the Gabonese capital Libreville to see the Copper Bullets beat Ivory Coast 8-7 on penalties in Sunday's final. It was in the same city 19 years ago that Zambia's coach and 18 players were killed in a plane crash on their way to Senegal for a World Cup qualifying match. Bwalya survived as he traveled to Dakar to meet up with the squad from his base in Europe, where he played for Dutch club PSV Eindhoven. Zambia win maiden Africa Cup of Nations title . Renard was Zambia coach between 2008 and 2010 before leaving to coach Angola, but Bwalya offered him a second stint last year. ""He is the best Zambian player of the last century and he escaped the plane crash,"" Renard was quoted as saying on the Confederation of Africa's official website. ""He was criticized for giving me the second chance. I dedicate the victory to him because he gave me the opportunity to coach. ""We wanted to honor the dead players and that strengthened us. Our first game was against Senegal and the team was on its way to Senegal for a match when the plane crashed. ""The plane crashed in Gabon and we won the final in Gabon. It is a sign of destiny."" In a dramatic final, Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba missed a penalty before the game was decided by a tense shootout, with Stoppila Sunzu striking the decisive blow. Zambia striker Collins Mbesuma added: ""I also believe the departed Zambian team of 1993 was with us in this final match. ""When Drogba missed the penalty l just knew it that it was our night, the departed were making sure the Ivorians would not score."" The Zambian squad flew back to the country's capital Lusaka on Monday to be greeted by thousands of cheering fans.","Africa Cup of Nations champions Zambia dedicate victory to former player Kalusha Bwalya .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan called 911 to ask for police help during an ""incident"" at the Betty Ford Center, her lawyer said Wednesday. The statement from Shawn Chapman Holley came after the rehab center fired an employee who reportedly leaked details of a tussle with Lohan. Holley declined to comment on what happened in the incident, but added that ""it should be noted"" that it was Lohan who called the police. Authorities in the Southern California city of Palm Desert confirmed Tuesday that they are investigating a claim that Lohan assaulted an employee at the center. Meanwhile, the employee, Dawn Holland, has hired a lawyer with an eye to filing employment and civil rights claims against the center. Holland was ""targeted, unmercifully interrogated, intimidated and threatened with her livelihood"" by the treatment center, lawyer Keith Davidson said. The accusations have thrust the actress back into the spotlight. ""The incident involved Lindsay Lohan and another female adult -- a staff member at the location and was reported as a suspect in the investigation,"" the Palm Desert Police Department said. ""The victim desires prosecution and the incident is being investigated as a misdemeanor committed not in the presence of a police officer."" The employee was fired after information was leaked to the media, the center said Tuesday. ""When patients come to the center for treatment, they come to a safe place where their identity is protected, where anonymity is safeguarded,"" the center said in a statement. ""Regrettably, on December 21, 2010, one of our employees violated strict confidentiality guidelines and laws by publicly identifying patients in a media interview and by disclosing a privileged document.That employee has been terminated by the Betty Ford Center."" The center did not confirm that Holland is the employee in question. Lohan checked into the Betty Ford Center on September 27, after it became clear a judge intended to send her to jail because of a failed drug test. The judge eventually ordered Lohan to stay in the drug rehabilitation program until January 3 instead of going to jail. If Lohan  violates the rules of her rehab program or fails a drug test before her next court date in February, she will be sent to jail for 180 days, a Los Angeles Superior Court has ordered. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","NEW: The actress called police for help, her lawyer says .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Protests erupted around the Haitian capital Tuesday night after an election council announced a runoff between a former first lady and a candidate allied with an increasingly unpopular government. Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady of Haiti, won the presidential election held over a week ago with 31.37 of the vote, the Provisional Electoral Council announced late Tuesday. Jude Celestin, the candidate backed by President Rene Preval, came in second with 22.48 percent while popular musician Michel Martelly was just behind Celestin with 21.84 percent. Fires erupted throughout the city late into the night, and protesters promised more violence. ""Preval is a thief. We don't need Jude Celestin. We need Michel Martelly,"" people chanted in the streets early Wednesday morning. ""Tomorrow we will set the country on fire."" Since no candidate obtained the 50 percent of the votes needed to win outright, Haitians will return to the polls in January, four days after the first anniversary of the devastating earthquake, to vote in a runoff election. But the vote was fraught with allegations of fraud, with many believing that Preval would go to any lengths to ensure a win for his protege, Celestin. The U.S. Embassy in Haiti issued a statement Tuesday saying that the United States stands ready to support efforts to review irregularities in the vote so that results are ""consistent with the will of the Haitian people expressed in their votes."" ""Like others, the government of the United States is concerned by the Provisional Electoral Council's announcement of preliminary results from the November 28 national elections that are inconsistent with the published results of the National Election Observation Council (CNO), which had more than 5,500 observers and observed the vote count in 1,600 voting centers nationwide,"" the embassy said. Celestin's entry into the runoff prompted violent demonstrations throughout Port-au-Prince. Gunfire rang out on the streets, and the smell of fires and burning tires filled the air. People ran out on the streets denouncing Celestin. In the central Champs de Mars plaza, white pickup trucks carried police in the back and made their way around barricaded streets. Residents of a tent city that covers the entire plaza beat on the rows of portable toilets, knocking one down. It had been feared that a win or runoff spot for Celestin would trigger more unrest in the Haitian capital. Preval's government has become increasingly unpopular with Haitians who see a lack of progress in their homeland. Preval was barred by the constitution from seeking another term. Celestin headed the state-run transportation company that gained notoriety in the days after the quake as its trucks picked up the bodies of the dead. The next president of Haiti will inherit the daunting task of leading this Caribbean nation in its struggle to recover from years of dictatorship and poverty compounded earlier this year by the earthquake and a current cholera epidemic that has now sickened almost 100,000 people. Martelly, a popular Kompa singer, alleged massive fraud and vowed to challenge the results. His campaign manager, Damian Merlo, said Martelly had expected that Preval would not relinquish power easily. ""The math says an absolute fraud,"" Merlo said. The OAS-CARICOM Joint Election Observation Mission, which includes the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, said it maintained a presence in the vote tabulation center. Last week, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the suspected fraud in the electoral process was more serious than previously thought. It took eight days to announce the final results of the November 28 election. Since then, riots have erupted in the Haitian capital, some violent enough for police to spray tear gas. Some aid workers, including United Nations staff, left their offices early to return home before darkness fell.","Mirlande Manigat and Jude Celestin are slated for a runoff in January .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate on Thursday rejected a Democratic bid to open debate on repealing the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy banning openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service, possibly killing any chance for it to get passed in the current congressional session. However, a bipartisan group of senators immediately said they would raise the issue again in a separate piece of legislation. It was unclear if the bid to separate the repeal provision from a larger defense authorization bill would increase its chances for approval. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called Thursday's vote without an agreement with any Republican senators to support the motion, ensuring it would fail. The vote was 57-40 in favor of the cloture motion that required 60 votes to pass. A Republican filibuster forced Democrats to seek a deal that would get them the necessary GOP support to get the 60 votes to proceed. The Democratic caucus has 58 members, meaning they needed at least two Republicans to join them to overcome the filibuster. Reid had been negotiating with moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine for her support, and he postponed a planned vote Wednesday to allow more time for the talks to reach agreement. However, Reid announced Thursday he was calling the vote to open debate on the defense authorization bill, saying it was time to act on it after months of Republican obstruction and intransigence. Collins, apparently caught by surprise, missed the start of Reid's speech and requested a chance to question him on the Senate floor. She reiterated her support for repealing ""don't ask, don't tell"" and asked if the deal she had been discussing with Reid on Wednesday still stood. Reid indicated he would honor parameters of the deal, which would allow Republicans to offer up to 10 amendments along with ample time for debate, but he refused to make an outright commitment. He blamed Republican leaders for the situation and praised Collins for being the only GOP senator he could even speak to about a possible deal for her support. In response, Collins said, ""I am perplexed and frustrated that this important bill is going to become a victim of politics. We should be able to do better."" The vote then proceeded, with Collins joining Democrats in voting to open debate while one Democrat, newly elected Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, voted with the filibustering Republicans. Manchin's opposing vote killed any chance for the Democrats to succeed. President Barack Obama said in a statement that he was ""extremely disappointed that yet another filibuster has prevented the Senate from moving forward"" with the defense authorization measure that includes the repeal provision. Noting support for repeal from the defense secretary, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman and a majority of Americans, Obama said the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy ""weakens our national security, diminishes our military readiness, and violates fundamental American principles of fairness, integrity and equality,"" Obama's statement said. ""While today's vote was disappointing, it must not be the end of our efforts,"" Obama said. ""I urge the Senate to revisit these important issues during the lame-duck session."" Gay rights advocacy groups, including those comprising military personnel, immediately condemned the Senate vote. ""Today leaders of both parties let down the U.S. military and the American people,"" said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign. ""Instead of doing what is right, 'the world's greatest deliberative body' devolved into shameful schoolyard spats that put petty partisan politics above the needs of our women and men in uniform."" Solmonese added. ""This fight is too important to give up despite this setback and we will continue fighting in this lame-duck session. It's not over."" Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who caucuses with the Democrats, later said he believed that up to four Republican senators -- Collins, Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Richard Lugar of Indiana -- might support a separate repeal proposal that he will introduce with Collins and Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colorado. Before Thursday's vote, Reid complained that all 42 of the GOP senators have pledged to block action on any measure before the chamber deals with extending Bush-era tax cuts and authorizing government spending for the rest of the fiscal year. The Democratic strategy appeared to be to try to persuade Collins to vote for opening debate on the measure so that the two other Republicans who also have expressed support for a repeal -- Brown and Murkowski -- also might do so. Murkowski announced her support for a repeal in a statement Wednesday. Democrats were pushing for action now because the new Congress in January brings a Republican-controlled House and a diminished Democratic majority in the Senate, which will make repealing ""don't ask, don't tell"" more difficult. Collins said Wednesday she had asked Reid to delay the vote until after the Senate completes work on the package of tax measures negotiated by the White House and congressional leaders, which Republicans consider a top priority in the final weeks of the lame-duck session that ends in early January. She also wanted Reid to schedule sufficient time to debate the defense authorization bill that contains the ""don't ask, don't tell"" repeal measure. Both Reid and Collins, in their comments on the Senate floor Thursday, acknowledged an agreement for the debate to include up to 15 amendments -- 10 by Republicans and five by Democrats. However, Reid appeared to oppose the request to wait until the tax package had been passed. Obama has been calling senators in both parties to urge their support, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Before Thursday's vote, Gibbs told reporters that congressional repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" was the best way forward, and he believed it could happen before the end of the year. Obama has called for repealing ""don't ask, don't tell"" after years of debate on the policy that detractors consider discriminatory. More than 400 military personnel were discharged under the policy in 2009, and a federal judge ruled it unconstitutional in a case that is under appeal. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen both have urged Congress to vote for a repeal. The measure before the Senate, which has already gained approval in the House, contains a process for implementing the change that requires certification from the president, the defense secretary and the Joint Chiefs chairman. Gates has warned that court challenges to ""don't ask, don't tell"" could force an immediate repeal of the policy, rather than the process in the legislation that would allow the military to manage the change on a longer timetable. CNN's Tom Cohen and CNN's senior congressional correspondent Dana Bash contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama says he is ""extremely disappointed""

"(CNN) -- Missouri police are investigating the death of a 27-year-old woman whose body was found this week at the home of beer tycoon August Busch IV. Frontenac, Missouri, police officers got a 911 call just before 1:15 p.m. last Sunday about an unresponsive woman at a residence later identified as belonged to Busch, the town's police chief, Thomas Becker, said in a news release. Paramedics and police officers arrived eight minutes later to find Adrienne Nicole Martin dead, ""with no apparent signs of trauma or other indications of cause of death,"" Becker said. Busch's lawyer, Art Margulis, on Friday described Martin as a friend of his client. ""There's absolutely nothing here that would indicate that this occurred under any suspicious circumstances,"" said Margulis. ""It's a tragic death of a ... very nice young lady."" Police in Frontenac, where the home is located, said they are investigating the death with help from the St. Louis County medical examiner. The community of about 3,500 people is 11 miles west of St. Louis. Martin was a model and aspiring art therapist, described as Native American on her page on iStudio.com, which says it serves ""the modeling, photography, and associated industries."" In the About Me section of her page, she writes that she had been in beauty pageants for years and ""would really like to do beer advertising."" Busch, 46, became chief executive officer of Anheuser-Busch in December 2006, after years of working in the company's brewing, operations and marking divisions. He was in charge in 2008 when Belgian brewer InBev engineered a $52 billion takeover of the then-St. Louis, Missouri, company. With that move, the combined Anheuser-Busch InBev became the world's largest brewer. ""It was a very difficult time, when August Busch IV took over,"" said Julie MacIntosh, author of the book ""Dethroning the King"" focusing on the last decade of Anheuser-Busch. ""On a personal level, it was difficult for (August Busch IV) when the company was taken over."" He and several other members of his family, including his father and fellow former CEO August Busch III, took home tens of millions of dollars from the move, said MacIntosh. That also largely ended the Busch family's long legacy in brewing, namely heading the legendary eastern Missouri institution known for its Budweiser and other brands. The story started with Adolphus Busch, the company founder and August Busch IV's great-grandfather. August Busch IV is the only representative of the family -- and its former namesake company -- on the Anheuser-Busch InBev board of directors. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: August Busch IV is the only member of his family on Anheuser-Busch InBev's board .

"(CNN) -- Sporting continued their worst start to a season since the Portuguese league was founded in 1933 as they lost 3-1 at home to Benfica, with fans of the Lisbon club further suffering as their city rivals went top of the table. Already knocked out of the Portuguese Cup and the Europa League, Sporting are now 18 points behind Benfica and second-placed FC Porto, who both boast 29 points, and just four points off the bottom of the Primeira Liga. Traditionally one of the big three of the Portuguese game, Sporting have - along with Benfica and Porto - won all but two of the 78 titles in the country's football history. Yet a club that won its last league title in 2002, and which last competed in the Champions League three years ago (when suffering a humiliating 12-1 aggregate defeat to Bayern Munich), is now in greater danger of suffering the first relegation in its history. Despite leading at the break after a fine Ricky van Wolfswinkel goal, Sporting surrendered in the second half as striker Oscar Cardozo had a hand in all three goals -- forcing two own goals either side of netting an 81st-minute penalty to preserve the Eagles' unbeaten run. After Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz was sent off for saving a goalbound effort with his hand, Paraguayan Cardozo slid home a cool penalty to spark an exodus for Sporting fans from the Estadio Jose Alvalade. Belgian coach Franky Vercauteren only took charge of Sporting, who won the Cup Winners Cup in the 1960s and lost the Uefa Cup final in their own stadium in 2005, one month ago -- becoming the club's seventh coach in just four seasons. ""In the second half, Sporting had great difficulty in keeping up with our game, because we always had a strong and intense style of play,"" Benfica coach Jorge Jesus told his club's official website. ""We beat a great team, one that will improve."" While Benfica's Eagles regained confidence after last week's Champions League exit, Sporting's current predicament makes a mockery of the team's stated ambition upon its founding -- which was to be ""a great club, as great as the greatest in Europe."" Elsewhere across the continent, Lazio extended their unbeaten league run to five games after drawing 0-0 at Bologna -- a result which left the Rome side, who lost striker Liber Kozak to a late red card, three points behind third-placed Napoli in Serie A. Earlier, Udinese climbed three places to eighth in the table after winning 2-0 at Sampdoria --as goals from Danilo and Antonio Di Natale took the Udine side just behind AC Milan in Serie A. In the English Premier League, Fulham beat Newcastle United 2-1 at home to end a run of seven games without a win, as Steve Sidwell and Hugo Rodallega scored either side of a dipping Hatem Ben Arfa strike for the visitors.","Sporting's worst season since the Portuguese league was founded in 1933 continues .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Chen Xiao had pretty much given up making her own decisions and so decided to throw open her life to the whims of China's hundreds of millions of Internet users, known in China as netizens. Beijing resident Chen Xiao decided to put her life up for sale after an unhappy 2008. ""It's your right to arrange Chen Xiao's life, and it's my obligation to serve you,"" read her online shop. Since December, Chen has been allowing others to decide what she will do each day, because, for the most part, last year was awful, she said. Her hometown was hit by blizzards, her country rocked by a devastating earthquake, friends divorced and her clothing shop went bankrupt. ""Every time I had a plan for what I wanted my life to be like, nothing would come of it. It was very disappointing. I figured if other people came up with things for me to do, I might stumble upon something new and better,"" she told CNN. What she stumbled upon was not only a new life but a new way to make a living. She charges about $3 an hour, and she's been asked to do almost everything from delivering pet food to caring for stray cats to taking a hot lunch to a homeless man. What surprised her the most was not so much the varied requests but being able to find happiness in the process. ""If somebody asks you to do something, something simple, and you do it, it can make you very happy. You can change from a gloomy person to a very bright one. It can help give you a new sense of self-esteem,"" she said. So far, the most meaningful assignment she was given was attending a child's birth -- the father was a complete stranger who just wanted someone to take pictures and share the moment. There are limits to what she will agree to do. She will not do anything illegal, immoral or violent, but she said that has not stopped some from asking. ""When I first started there was this man who would send me these really disgusting text messages. His words were over the top... nauseating,"" she said. There was also a man who wanted to meet her for a few private hours at a ski chalet. When she turned up with a friend to take photographs, he backed out and then demanded a refund, but Chen refused. In many ways she is just a glorified errand girl, but with a unique China twist. Chen is another example here of how in China the Internet is crossing over from cyberspace to the real world. Chen does not know how much longer she will keep taking cyberrequests. For now it is a good way to survive the financial crisis when many others are losing their jobs and businesses are going broke. ""When people stop needing me, I'll go back to my original life. But I don't know what will come,"" she said. China's netizens will most likely make that decision for her as well.","26-year-old Chen Xiao put her life online, asking people to fill it with tasks .

"(CNN) -- Cape Verde and Ethiopia showed over the weekend that David remains very capable of dealing Goliath a knockout blow in international football as both nations advanced to the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. Cameroon missed out on a second successive Cup of Nations tournament after a 3-2 aggregate defeat to Cape Verde, which has a population of 500,000. Trailing 2-0 following last week's first-leg loss in Praia, the Indomitable Lions fell further behind when striker Heldon Nhuck gave Cape Verde a surprise 1-0 lead in the Cameroonian capital of Yaounde. Achille Emana equalized for Cameroon before half-time but, despite boasting the attacking talent of former Barcelona and Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto'o, the home team were unable to find the back of the net. A late goal from 16-year-old debutant Fabrice Olinga, who is a graduate of the ""Samuel Eto'o Foundation"", finally put Cameroon ahead in the match, but it wasn't enough to prevent Cape Verde reaching their Africa Cup of Nations. Also through to January's 16-team tournament in South Africa is Ethiopia, who beat Sudan 2-0 to advance on away goals, to reach the tournament for the first time in 30 year. Ethiopia lost the first leg 5-3, but progressed courtesy of goals from Adane Girma and Saladin Seid in Addis Ababa. The tournament, won by Zambia in 2012, is ordinarily held every two years, but it is being staged in 2013 to avoid the competition clashing with future World Cups and the European Championships. Angola overturned a 3-1 first-leg deficit to beat Zimbabwe on away goals. Former Manchester United striker Manucho scored two headed goals inside the first eight minutes to give his country a 2-0 win. Algeria eased through with a 2-0 victory at home to Libya, wrapping up a 3-0 aggregate success. This edition of the tournament had been due to be staged in Libya, but it was switched to South Africa due to the civil uprising in the country. Burkina Faso reached a third consecutive Cup of Nations by beating Central African Republic 3-2 on aggregate. Central African Republic went 2-0 ahead in the tie and 1-0 up in the match before the hosts replied through Alain Troare. Moumouni Dagano scored from the penalty spot to make it 2-2 on aggregate before Traore scored his second and Burkina Faso's third to deny Central African Republic a first Cup of Nations appearance. A goal from Tottenham Hotspur striker Emmanuel Adebayor proved crucial for Togo, who won Sunday's second leg against Gabon 2-1 to seal a 3-2 aggregate success. Niger and Equatorial Guinea complete the tournament line-up following victories against Guinea and Democratic Republic of Congo respectively. The draw for the 29th Africa Cup of Nations will take place in the South African city of Durban on October 24.","Cameroon fail to qualify for second successive Africa Cup of Nations .

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- James Ian Tyson acknowledges that he is a political activist. He admits he has been arrested a couple of times for relatively minor offenses. But he insists he's not a terrorist. Tyson, who describes himself on his Facebook page as a carpenter with a ""veggie farm,"" says he has no idea how he wound up on the government's terrorist watch list. He just wants to save the rain forest. The only dings on his record, at least as far as he knows, consist of fishing for trout out of season and driving while impaired. The 27-year-old, known as ""Jimmy"" around Charlotte's activist community, was pulled over Sunday near a building where protesters plan their demonstrations. He was charged with driving with a revoked license. And then he was thrown in jail under exceptionally high bail -- $10,000. Vermin Supreme: The protester who would be president . The arresting officer asked a magistrate to keep him behind bars for the duration of the Democratic National Convention, which ends Thursday night. He advised against releasing Tyson on his promise to show up for court. ""Why do you feel suspect is a risk?"" a bail sheet asked, and the officer wrote: ""Known activist + protester who is currently on a terrorist watch list. Request he be held due to DNC being a National Special Security Event."" (Both political conventions received the designation from the federal Department of Homeland Security. It freed up federal funding for security and put the Secret Service in charge.) About 800 protesters marched through uptown Charlotte on Sunday in the first and largest of a week of demonstrations. Only a handful of people have been arrested at the convention in Charlotte, and the Republican National Convention last week in Tampa, Florida -- a sharp contrast to previous years, when hundreds of protesters were arrested. But there have been complaints at both conventions that the police presence is excessive, and the high security has chilled free speech. Tyson's arrest has some observers wondering whether police crossed the line to suppress dissent. ""The question is whether or not the stop and the arrest and the attempt to get an unreasonably high bond amount was really a pretext for a police officer's selective motivation to censor an individual's political activity,"" said Jason Huber, a professor at Charlotte School of Law. ""If that's the case, then you're in First Amendment territory."" He added it will be difficult to prove what was on the officer's mind when he made what appears to be a legitimate car stop. ""It's a question of what evidence is there to determine intent,"" Huber said. ""There rarely is a smoking gun when it comes to establishing someone's unlawful intent in a particular action. And you have to rely on circumstantial evidence. The circumstantial in this case is a bit suspicious."" Anarchists Target Political Conventions . Charlotte-Mecklenburg police did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. R. Andrew Murray, the Mecklenburg County district attorney, said that while the high bail was ""not typical for a revoked license charge,"" the court document ""heightens our concern for public safety."" Tyson spent Sunday night and most of Monday in jail. He called a legal hot line for protesters and was given an attorney, Derek Fletcher. The Charlotte lawyer got before a judge, Lisa Bell, on Monday and convinced her to lower Tyson's bail to $2,500. He walked free on Monday night. ""I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide,"" Tyson said as he left the Mecklenburg County Jail. ""I believe this is an attempt to stifle my First Amendment rights and keep my voice from being heard."" He said he was no longer interested in protesting during the convention, believing police had targeted him. ""At this point,"" he said, ""I would like to go home and visit my parents and play with my dog."" Tyson is a volunteer with the Rainforest Action Network and has spoken at Occupy Charlotte events, according to the group's website and Twitter feeds. His attorney said he was jailed in an attempt to muzzle him and prevent him from organizing protests. ""I firmly believe that Mr. Tyson has been profiled and has been singled out as an organizer, and I believe that the government in this case had the intention of suppressing speech before it was even exercised,"" Fletcher said. ""I think it's censorship pure and simple, and I have never seen a $10,000 cash bond on any kind of traffic charge."" Tyson agrees. ""I personally believe that this was purely politically motivated,"" he said, ""solely, solely based on the pretext of getting me off the street, pushing me into a cell and throwing away the key for as long as they possibly could."" He owns up to his mistakes, and his brushes with the law. 5 OMG moments at the DNC . ""I haven't been arrested for anything else even remotely political,"" he said. ""The first arrest was for fishing out of season two days. I messed up, I wasn't looking at the rules right, I apologized. I'm a dedicated catch and release fisherman. I love fishing and fish is one of my passions. My other arrest was for a DWI, which I really regret. But I took responsibility for my actions. As a matter of fact, I was two weeks away from finishing my drug and alcohol courses in order to get my license back."" But he doesn't understand how that got him on the government's terrorist watch list. Federal authorities do not discuss how the list is compiled, or even confirm who is on it, according to the Department of Homeland Security. ""Just being on this list alone is really frightening for me,"" Tyson said. ""This could potentially affect the rest of my life. And they have no cause, they have no cause to do that at all. Some of the questions that tumble around my head are: 'Who's making these lists? Like where's the accountability? Why am I on this list? Why are other people on this list?' ""And most importantly, probably, 'How do I get off this list?' "" CNN's Joe Johns contributed to this report.","James Ian Tyson was jailed before the convention on a revoked license charge .

"New York (CNN) -- New York police said Friday they have new video showing what they called a ""person of interest"" in the case of a woman whose body was found in a suitcase earlier this week. Detectives from New York's 23rd precinct, in the city's Harlem neighborhood, made the video public two days after the victim's body was found. Police had earlier released a separate, grainy video showing what they believe is the same man, rolling a suitcase down a street. The new video shows a dark-skinned man, wearing a black winter hat and a heavy jacket, at a store. He appears to be carrying several items when he enters the store, takes money from his wallet, and eventually leaves after making some purchases. Police did not detail how they got the new footage, where it came from, or at what time it was shot. On Thursday, police identified the victim as Betty Williams, 28, from the Bronx. Williams was strangled and then stuffed into the dark-colored piece of luggage, authorities said. Blood was leaking from suitcase when it was found Wednesday night, police said. ""The cause of death is strangulation,"" Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Thursday. ""We initially announced it was trauma to the back of the head -- that was the belief of the investigators at the scene."" Shortly after the find, the first video was released showing a man dressed in a dark knit hat and leather jacket with light-colored pants, pulling the suitcase near a stoop in East Harlem. The man pauses as three people walk by before hauling the suitcase past a dark-colored sport utility vehicle and out of the camera's sight. The New York Police Department is seeking the public's help in identifying the suspect in the videos, according to a police statement. Those with information are encouraged to submit tips online at www.nypdcrimestoppers.com or call 800-577-TIPS. ""We're talking to relatives and we hope to have more definitive information about her acquaintances that will help in the investigation,"" Kelly said.

"(CNN) -- Europe's top soccer teams will play their Champions League semifinals this week after opting to undertake grueling bus journeys to avoid the flight restrictions enforced due to the volcanic ash from Iceland which has paralyzed air travel in the region. Titleholders Barcelona have begun a 1,000-kilometer road trip from northern Spain to Italy for the first leg of Tuesday night's semifinal against Inter Milan. The Catalan club's Web site reported that the squad left on Sunday afternoon for a 634 km trip to Cannes in France, where they will stay overnight before completing the further 351 km to Milan. Spanish leaders Barcelona drew 0-0 with city rivals Espanyol on Saturday night, but midfielder Sergio Busquets told reporters on Sunday afternoon that the difficult schedule was no excuse for not performing well at Inter's San Siro. ""We are in with a chance to reach another final and we don't want to throw that away. We have been having a lot of big games and it's not the ideal way to travel to Milan, but there can be no excuses,"" he said, according to Barcelona's Web site. ""Maybe spending so long together on a coach will bring us closer and help us focus on beating Inter. It's a long time on the road and we're not really used to that, but with music and a film or two, I'm sure the trip won't seem so long."" French club Lyon also have a long journey ahead for the first leg of their last-four clash with German leaders Bayern Munich on Wednesday. Lyon had to travel 600 km home following Saturday's 2-2 draw with French champions Bordeaux which effectively ended both side's domestic title hopes with five matches to play. The squad will be back on the bus again for a 750 km trip to Bavaria, stopping overnight in the Swiss city of Zurich before arriving in Germany on Tuesday. ""Seven hours on the bus wasn't easy. We didn't sleep, but it was a good chance for a chat,"" captain Cris said in quotes carried by Bayern's Web site on Sunday. ""It'll be a total of 10 hours on the bus, which is hard,"" the Brazilian said of the next stage of the journey. ""But there's no choice and we have to accept it."" European football's governing body UEFA said on Sunday that decisions about Thursday's semifinals of the second-tier Europa League would be made in the next few days. Liverpool must travel to Spain to play Atletico Madrid, while fellow English club Fulham must go to Germany to take on Hamburg in the first legs of their last-four ties.

"(CNN) -- Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblogging platform, has introduced a VIP paid membership package in an effort to monetize its vast community of 324 million users who use its services for free. The VIP membership includes fifteen ""special privileges"" under the categories of user personalization, functions, mobile phone, and security. These perks range from using fancier homepage templates, following a higher number of users, and receiving SMS birthday alerts and password reminders. Users can increasingly access these features, as they progress through six different levels of membership based on points awarded for usage. A one-month subscription is priced at 10 RMB (US$ 1.57). Discounts are offered for longer subscriptions of three months to two years. The VIP package has generally been met with muted enthusiasm by industry analysts. The free features of the site are sufficient for users, You Tianyu, an analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy iResearch, told state newspaper, Global Times. He predicted the premium services would not be significantly profitable and recommended that Sina concentrate on advertising and gaming revenues. This move follows monetization initiatives introduced last year, such as ""Weibi"" virtual currency and ""Weihao"" custom account numbers.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The lawyer for one of the men accused in the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman wants the trial moved out of New Delhi, where emotions have run high over the case. The defense lawyer will argue before the Indian Supreme Court on Wednesday that transferring legal proceedings outside the Indian capital would ensure a free and fair hearing. His appearance, which was originally scheduled for Tuesday, was pushed back a day. The case has gripped India, prompting protests in the capital and other cites over the treatment of women and criticism of the way sexual assault cases are dealt with. Opinion: India's rape problem needs a rewiring of society's attitude . The consequences of the case are still unfolding in the Indian news media, with calls for tougher punishment of people convicted of rape. The five adult suspects in the December 16 incident appeared at a closed-door hearing at a fast-track court in New Delhi on Monday. Details about what was said in court cannot be reported under a judge's ruling imposing restrictions on coverage of the case. Police allege the suspects attacked the woman and her male companion on a bus, robbed them and dumped them by the side of the road. The woman, badly injured in the attack, died two weeks later despite being flown to Singapore for treatment. Her companion survived. The five men are charged with murder, rape and kidnapping and could face the death penalty if convicted. A sixth suspect, who is believed to be too young to be tried as an adult, is facing proceedings in a juvenile court. Indian rape debate: Why death penalty is no solution . The case is being heard in a ""fast-track"" court, which India introduced to try to expedite cases in a justice system bogged down by red tape. It means sessions of the trial, once it begins, should take place nearly every working day until a verdict is reached. The hearing Monday was a procedural step at which the charge sheet detailing prosecutors' accusations against the suspects was submitted. The trial will begin once the prosecution's arguments are made in court. Rape case 'an awakening' for India, victim's father says . The next hearing is scheduled for Thursday, according to defense lawyers. The magistrates' court that initially heard the case imposed restrictions on what the news media can report about events in court. That practice is common in rape cases in India to protect the victim's identity, and the magistrate said it was also necessary out of concern for the suspects' safety amid intense media coverage and widespread anger. India rape victim's family wants hospital in her village . Authorities have not released the name of the dead woman, but Indian protesters have been calling her Damini, which means ""lightning"" in Hindi. ""Damini"" is also a 1993 Bollywood film whose lead female character fights for a housemaid, a victim of sexual assault. Companion of India rape victim: I begged attackers to stop . The government has pledged to strengthen laws against sexual assaults after the outrage over the case. The events have also focused the attention of the Indian news media on attacks against women around the huge country. Newspapers and television stations have been reporting other shocking rape allegations on an almost daily basis. In one of the most recent examples, police in the eastern state of Odisha arrested six men over accusations they gang raped a 25-year-old woman on Sunday as she was on her way home from visiting her brother in a hospital. The six men, including two who worked as custodians at the hospital, are alleged to have taken the woman to an isolated area by a river and sexually assaulted her, said B.K. Aich, a police superintendent in the district of Mayurbhanj. Police are waiting for medical reports on the suspects to determine whether to take the case to court, Aich said. The number of reported rapes in India -- a country where a cultural stigma keeps many victims from reporting the crime -- has increased from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011, according to official figures. Most women in India have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, the Indian Council on Global Relations says.

"Paris (CNN) -- Police in France have arrested a man in connection with the killing of three Kurdish activists in Paris this month, prosecutors said Monday. The suspect, Omer Guney, is a 30-year-old Turkish national who, prosecutors said, has been a member of the Kurdish nationalist PKK for two years -- the same group co-founded by one of the victims. The activists' apparent assassination earlier this month sparked shock in the Kurdish community. Mystery had swirled around the slayings, with no claim of responsibility or any indication from authorities as to who might have pulled the trigger. The fact that one of the women was a founding member of the PKK, the Kurdish Workers' Party -- a group viewed by Turkey, the United States and others as a terror organization -- led to heightened speculation. The killings come at a delicate time for Kurds in Turkey, where analysts say the government has recently entered into talks with Kurdish leaders -- among them the jailed head of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan. Analysts have suggested the attack could have been an attempt to derail a nascent peace process in what is one of the Middle East's longest-running conflicts. The PKK, a pan-Kurdish nationalist movement, is best known internationally for the guerrilla war it has fought for nearly three decades against the government of Turkey, a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives. The ethnic Kurdish population extends across parts of Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq. Last week thousands took to the streets in the predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, Turkey, to mourn the activists' deaths. The women were saluted as the ""three flowers of Kurdistan"" by a mourner using a sound system atop a bus, while some carried portraits of the victims or signs reading ""Sakine Cansiz is immortal."" Cansiz, one of the three killed, was a co-founder of the PKK. Also killed were Leyla Sonmez and Fidan Dogan. French authorities said the bodies of the three women were discovered in the Information Center of Kurdistan in Paris. After the killings, French Interior Minister Manuel Valls told reporters in Paris the three women had been ""without doubt executed"" and described the killings as ""totally unacceptable.""

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama said ""a very affectionate thanks"" to the people of Illinois in a letter published Sunday in the Chicago Sun-Times and other newspapers across his home state. Obama announced on Thursday that his resignation from the U.S. Senate is official as of Sunday. ""Today, I am ending one journey to begin another,"" Obama's letter said. ""After serving the people of Illinois in the United States Senate -- one of the highest honors and privileges of my life -- I am stepping down as senator to prepare for the responsibilities I will assume as our nation's next president."" Obama wrote about moving to Illinois two decades ago ""as a young man eager to do my part in building a better America."" ""On the South Side of Chicago, I worked with families who had lost jobs and lost hope when the local steel plant closed. It wasn't easy, but we slowly rebuilt those neighborhoods one block at a time, and in the process I received the best education I ever had,"" he wrote. Obama followed his years as a community organizer and lawyer with a successful bid for the Illinois state Senate. ""It was in Springfield, in the heartland of America, where I saw all that is America converge -- farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard. It was there that I learned to disagree without being disagreeable; to seek compromise while holding fast to those principles that can never be compromised, and to always assume the best in people instead of the worst,"" his letter said. His letter recalled people he met in his travels around the state during his run for the U.S. Senate four years ago. ""I still remember the young woman in East St. Louis who had the grades, the drive and the will but not the money to go to college. I remember the young men and women I met at VFW halls across the state who serve our nation bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I will never forget the workers in Galesburg who faced the closing of a plant they had given their lives to, who wondered how they would provide health care to their sick children with no job and little savings,"" he wrote. Obama said his memories of the people of Illinois ""will stay with me when I go to the White House in January."" ""The challenges we face as a nation are now more numerous and difficult than when I first arrived in Chicago, but I have no doubt that we can meet them. For throughout my years in Illinois, I have heard hope as often as I have heard heartache. Where I have seen struggle, I have seen great strength. And in a state as broad and diverse in background and belief as any in our nation, I have found a spirit of unity and purpose that can steer us through the most troubled waters,"" he wrote. Obama then quoted Abraham Lincoln -- ""another son of Illinois"" who left for Washington. ""To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe everything,"" he quoted Lincoln as writing about Illinois. ""Today, I feel the same, and like Lincoln, I ask for your support, your prayers, and for us to 'confidently hope that all will yet be well,'"" Obama wrote. His letter concluded: . ""With your help, along with the service and sacrifice of Americans across the nation who are hungry for change and ready to bring it about, I have faith that all will in fact be well. And it is with that faith, and the high hopes I have for the enduring power of the American idea, that I offer the people of my beloved home a very affectionate thanks."" Obama's Senate office will close sometime within two months. His Senate staff will spend that time coordinating with his replacement, advising constituents with open requests, and archiving documents for Obama's presidential library. Several Illinois Democrats, including Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth, a former congressional candidate who now serves in Gov. Rod Blagojevich's administration, have been mentioned as possible Senate replacements for Obama. Blagojevich, a Democrat who will appoint Obama's successor, announced last week that he was assembling a panel to look over likely candidates. Obama's replacement would be up for re-election in 2010. Vice president-elect Joe Biden, who was also re-elected in Delaware to his Senate seat on November 4, told an interviewer several weeks ago that he would resign when he's sworn in as vice president in January.","President-elect Barack Obama thanks Illinois residents as he resigns from Senate .

"(CNN) -- Slowed, but not daunted, by Antarctic winds topping 100 mph, low visibility and snow, rescuers Saturday pounced on improving weather conditions to move closer to where a plane carrying three Canadians sent out emergency beacon signals. The condition of the three crew members on the Twin Otter operated by Calgary-based Kenn Borek Air Ltd. was not known nearly three days after the flight went missing and rescue attempts began. The plane was flying from the South Pole to an Italian base at Terra Nova Bay, Maritime New Zealand said. ""It is difficult to think of a more difficult environment,"" said Steve Rendle, spokesman for Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand. The beacon stopped working Thursday evening, possibly because the battery had run out, about a day after the plane was reported missing. By then, rescuers had pinpointed the location, but harsh weather has made visual sightings impossible, Rendle said. Winds, for example, reached nearly 105 mph Wednesday. One search aircraft reached a camp about 30 miles from where the beacon sounded. Two helicopters were moving toward the forward base on a glacier Saturday afternoon. A C-130 Hercules aircraft circled the beacon activation site, attempting to make visual contact. ""We've got a reasonably positive forecast for that site,"" Rendle said from Wellington. The missing crew's survival kit includes survival suits, mountain tents and enough food and water for five days. The aircraft is believed to be at a height of 13,000 feet near the top of Mount Elizabeth, part of the rugged Queen Alexandra Range. It is a long distance from any bases in Antarctica. ""We would expect them to be with the plane,"" Rendle said of the crew. ""Common sense would dictate you stay with the beacon."" Kenn Borek Air Ltd. did not immediately return a message left by CNN on Friday night. In a statement Wednesday, the airline described the flight as overdue. It did not release names of the crew members. According to its website, the airline has one of the largest Twin Otter fleets in the world. ""We are best known for our remote polar services utilizing ski-equipped Twin Otter,"" it said. ""KBAL provides a wide range of additional services including medevac, survey, paradrop, float operations, third-party maintenance and overhaul."" The Queen Alexandra Range, about 100 miles long, was named by Ernest Shackleton during the British Antarctic expedition in 1907-1909. Peter West, spokesman for the National Science Foundation, which oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, said 24 hours of daylight this time of year should help rescue efforts.

"Cairo (CNN) -- I took a long stroll through the cavernous Egyptian Museum, just off Tahrir Square, this month. It was the first time I went though the museum without breathless Egyptologists yanking me around, impatient children or a looming deadline. The place was packed, not with tourists, but mostly with Egyptian schoolchildren. They were led around by amazingly patient guides explaining the most minute of details about every little bit and piece on display. A few of the schoolchildren weren't listening very closely, but most were paying attention. They clearly did feel a connection, at some level, with these ancient pharaonic artifacts. And not surprisingly. They must have recognized, in those ancient faces, their ancestors. Certainly, if you look closely at some of the more lifelike statues, you will see faces identical to the faces you see every day here. There are some in Egypt, however, who seem hell bent on repudiating, indeed destroying, the link between Egypt's distant past and its messy present. Opinion: Timbuktu tomb attack is an attack on our humanity . Morgan Al-Gohary, a jihadi sheikh with a history of radicalism, appeared on the private Egyptian TV channel Dream TV 2 Saturday evening and declared that if he and his ilk ever came to power, they would not hesitate to destroy the Sphinx and the pyramids. He's no stranger to the notion of vandalizing ancient artifacts, boasting to the show's host, Wael Al-Abrashi, that while in Afghanistan, he took part along with the Taliban in the demolition of the Bamyan Buddhas in March 2001. His threat was met by Al-Abrashi and the other two guests with shock. Just to be clear, Al-Abrashi asked the same question three times. Al-Abrashi: ""Am I going to wake up tomorrow to find that, just as you did with the statue of Buddha, that you have demolished the Sphinx and the pyramids?"" Al-Gohary: ""That is dependent upon abilities and possibility. According to our Sharia, every pagan and idol must be destroyed."" Al-Abrashi: ""If you are in power, will you destroy the Sphinx and the pyramids and all the pharoanic statues and all the pharoanic artifacts?"" Al-Gohary: ""Everything, if it is a pagan statue or idol, that is worshiped or suspected to be worshipped, or is worshipped by one person on Earth, must be destroyed. We, or someone else, must destroy it."" Al-Abrashi: ""So you would destroy the Sphinx and the pyramids?"" Al-Gohary: ""Yes, we will destroy them, if they were worshipped before or afterwards."" One of the guests, writer Nabil Sharaf Al-Din, seemed repulsed by this and told the sheikh: ""You don't know the history of your country well. Those pharaohs were the first to know religion in the world."" The Sphinx and the pyramids, he continued, ""are mankind's heritage and not the property of Egyptians alone. They are the property of all mankind."" The sheikh was unswayed. Al-Gohari's threat inspired Cairo's prolific blogger, known simply as Zeinobia, to write a blog on her website, egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com, titled ""Visit the pyramids while you can!!"" The Egyptian Revolution, born in rapture and enthusiasm, now resembles Pandora's box. Hope sprang forth, but so did extremism, demagoguery, crime, disorder and fear. And no one has come up with a way to put them all back in the box. In the days of Hosni Mubarak, everyone knew the extremists lurked on the dark, outer fringes of Egyptian society, but most kept a low profile, were behind bars or holed up in Afghanistan or Pakistan. In the new Egypt, they've come out of their cells and back from exile, and like Al-Gohary, rant on national television or make inflammatory speeches in Tahrir Square. Egyptians have heard this all before -- that the pyramids and the Sphinx are pagan monuments and idols, and must therefore must be destroyed. There was a widespread rumor last year that a Salafi (ultraconservative Muslim) leader was advocating covering the monuments in wax but that proved to be spurious. It's no secret, however, that the extremists here don't like what these ancient monuments represent -- proof that magnificent human achievement is not the monopoly of any one religion or race. In fact, Al-Gohary is not the first one to call for the destruction of Egypt's ancient landmarks. Back in 1378, an equally zealous Muslim mystic took offense at the Sphinx and took it upon himself to try and demolish it. There are several versions of what happened next. Some stories say a flash flood ensued, and villagers, fearing a pharaonic curse, promptly lynched him. Other accounts say he was charged with vandalism and subsequently executed. The point is that the Sphinx, minus its nose, is still here.","Jihadi sheikh tells Egyptian TV he might destroy pyramids if in power .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As Americans paused Wednesday to remember the extraordinary life of Sen. Edward Kennedy, political observers also took note of a rare development caused by his passing. Former Rep. Joe Kennedy may try to launch a political comeback amid all the Kennedy nostalgia. For the first time in 25 years, the state of Massachusetts has an open Senate seat. Nobody knows who will take it, but virtually everyone agrees that the fight to replace the Bay State's liberal lion is guaranteed to be fierce. Massachusetts is essentially a one-party state. Democrats control the governorship and every congressional seat and have overwhelming majorities in both houses of the state legislature. One unintended consequence of this monopoly is a lot of pent-up political ambition. Bay State Democrats itching to go to Washington usually have to wait -- for a long time. Kennedy won his Senate seat in 1962; John Kerry won his in 1984.  Watch newsreel of Kennedy's early years » . Massachusetts law requires a special election for Kennedy's seat to be held within 160 days. A long-term vacancy could have effects far beyond Kennedy's home state of Massachusetts, since his death deprives Democrats of the 60-vote majority necessary to force laws through the Senate despite Republican objections. Just last week, Kennedy urged that the law be changed to allow the governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election could be held. Gov. Deval Patrick on Wednesday told Boston radio station WBUR that he is in favor of the change and would sign it into law if the state legislature passed it. When the special election is over, the winner will serve out the remainder of Kennedy's term, which expires in January 2013. A slew of local officeholders have nothing to lose and everything to gain by tossing their hats in the ring. So who's on the list of possible contenders? Start with the state's 10-member House delegation. With the exception of 72-year-old Rep. John Olver, each one is considered a possible contender, said Bill Mayer, a Northeastern University political scientist. Rep. Ed Markey, a 17-term congressman from north of Boston, ran for Kerry's Senate seat in 1984. He also briefly aired television ads during his 2004 House re-election bid. Why? There wasn't a serious threat to Markey's House seat, but he wanted to raise his profile in the event of a Senate vacancy created by a Kerry presidential win over George W. Bush, Mayer said. The one caveat for Markey today: He may not want to give up his chairmanship of an influential House committee dealing with climate-change legislation. The same goes for Rep. Barney Frank, who has plenty of name recognition but may not want to cede the helm of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. Rep. Mike Capuano, now in his sixth term from Somerville, currently has the seat once held by President Kennedy and House Speaker Tip O'Neill. He took office in 1998 by edging out a 10-candidate primary field with 23 percent of the vote. Capuano and others might try to follow that same blueprint for a statewide victory, Mayer said. As little as 20 percent may be enough to win a heavily contested Senate primary. Capuano, Rep. Stephen Lynch from South Boston and Rep. Jim McGovern from Worcester might also bet that their stronger urban Democratic organizations can help them eke out a victory if the primary turnout is low. Money is certain to be a key factor. Former Rep. Marty Meehan, now the chancellor of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, has almost $5 million in contributions at his disposal that could be used for a Senate run. Massachusetts Democrats might, however, decide it's time to turn the political page by sending a woman to the U.S. Senate. The state's politically ambitious Attorney General Martha Coakley has the distinction of being one of the few women to win statewide. Rep. Niki Tsongas of Lowell, on the other hand, has the benefit of a famous name. Her husband -- former presidential candidate Paul Tsongas who passed away in 1997 -- represented Massachusetts for one term in the Senate from 1979 to 1985. But the most famous name in Massachusetts politics is, of course, Kennedy. Ted Kennedy's widow, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, has so far expressed no interest in filling the seat, according to sources. Speculation is nevertheless rampant that she might ultimately try to keep the seat in family hands. Former Rep. Joe Kennedy, who held Capuano's seat from 1987 to 1999, may also try to launch a political comeback on the strength of the current wave of emotion and nostalgia. The nephew of Ted Kennedy and son of Robert F. Kennedy, he currently heads Citizens Energy Corp., which provides home heating fuel for low-income Americans. Massachusetts may be headed for its most hotly contested Senate race in at least a quarter century.","State likely headed for its 1st hotly contested Senate race in a quarter century .

"(CNN) -- A 12 meter yacht bobbing off the coast of England is about to be blown to smithereens. Or at least, that's the plan. In a scene reminiscent of a James Bond film, the boat is slowly filled with gas while a sailor in a nearby vessel holds his finger over the detonator, ready to blow the floating target sky high. These aren't undercover spies, but sailing experts undertaking a controlled explosion as part of a series of ground-breaking experiments into nautical safety. Over eight months, the team from British magazine Yachting Monthly, took one boat and sank it, capsized it, ran it aground, set it on fire, and finally blew it up -- all in the name of safety. Their ""Crash Test Boat"" series recreated eight nautical disasters -- ranging from a leaking hull to a dismasted sailboat -- to find the best methods for preventing and dealing with them. From January 2013 the incidents will be documented together for the first time in a new book titled, aptly enough, ""The Crash Test Boat."" The results featured in the book have turned much conventional sailing wisdom on its head and earned praise from both safety experts and readers across the world. ""These are rare situations and when they do happen, people aren't in a position to test every method for dealing with it,"" Yachting Monthly technical editor, Chris Beeson, told CNN. ""For example, if your mast breaks off, the age-old answer was to use bolt croppers to cut away the rigging and prevent more damage. ""But we found that hanging over the edge of the boat while it's rocking around like a fairground ride, with both hands on the croppers, wasn't practical. A simple hacksaw, which you could use with one hand, was much more effective."" Roger Brydges, sailing accident investigator at the Maritime Accident Investigation Branch, said recreating sailing disasters to such minute detail had never been done before. ""Being able to monitor the effects and test a range of responses was invaluable,"" he added. The Crash Test Boat series was first floated as Beeson and fellow sailing enthusiasts mulled over enduring maritime questions such as: 'What would you do if your mast fell over?' or 'How would you survive in a capsized boat?' ""We wanted to take theses problems and deal with them in real life,"" he said. Each experiment was modeled on real-life disasters, such as the 1979 Fastnet race in which storms in the Irish Sea capsized many of the competing yachts, resulting in 15 deaths. The series ended quite literally with a bang, in an impressive gas explosion. Though it very nearly didn't get off the ground to begin with. ""The authorities were telling us that a gas explosion was too dangerous, that we were crazy,"" former Yachting Monthly editor Paul Gelder said. ""We were considering everything -- traveling the 12 mile (19 kilometer) limit into international waters to escape the rules, even using a special effects expert from the Harry Potter films to simulate an explosion."" After finally gaining permission to carry out the explosion, the boat was anchored in a 200 meter exclusion zone and Royal Navy explosives experts were enlisted to set up the blast. But after an anxious 25 minute wait, the flash igniters set up around the leaking gas pipe failed to go off. Deflated but still determined, the team vowed to give it one last shot. This time, the explosion was detonated by a wireless trigger -- and it didn't disappoint. ""There was a brief orange fireball followed by the explosion. A hundred pieces of debris were hurled skywards amidst a plume of smoke,"" says the report in the book. ""The scale of the carnage was clear -- the entire coach roof had been blasted off the hull."" For the team, the explosion was also a thrilling chance to live out a few Bond-style fantasies, as Gelder said: ""How many people get to blow up a 40 foot (yacht) as part of their job -- and all in the name of safety?"" Now a battered mess, the Crash Test Boat continues to educate the public, exhibited at boating shows across Britain and used as a teaching aid at the International Boat Building College in Suffolk. ""A bit like the equivalent of a dead body in an anatomy class,"" Gelder explained. Beeson says the boat's greatest gift was showing sailors that ""you really can rely on yourself."" ""All the situations are recoverable. Your boat won't sink if there's hole in it. If your mast falls down you can still row to shore. The real importance of these tests was getting definitive answers in situations where people might normally panic.""","12-meter yacht is sunk, capsized, set on fire and blown up -- all in the name of safety .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- As Afghan authorities announced the arrest of an alleged militant for planning last week's assault on Kabul, a bomber targeted a U.S. base outside the capital, the latest attempt by militants to strike the seat of Western and Afghan power. The NATO-led command said the latest explosion occurred around 5 p.m. Tuesday outside the main gate at Camp Phoenix, a U.S. military base on the outskirts of the capital. It said initial reports indicate that the blast was caused by a vehicle bomb, but did not release any casualty figures. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack, authorities said. An Afghan military official at the scene of the strike said the vehicle blast injured eight Afghan civilians and two U.S. service members, and an eyewitness showed CNN digital camera photos of about 11 or 12 injured people. Taliban spokesman Zabullah Mujahid claimed in a text message that the strike killed 25 soldiers and damaged three tanks. Afghan soldiers cordoned off the area about 60 meters, or more than 65 yards, from the blast. The latest explosion erupted eight days after a dramatic and well-coordinated assault on key government sites in Kabul killed five people and wounded more than 70 others. The January 18 strike was particularly audacious because militants penetrated the Afghan government's power centers as members of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's Cabinet were to be sworn into office. The National Directorate of Security on Tuesday announced the arrest of a 29-year-old man named Kamulddin in connection with the attack and released a video of him confessing to the coordinated strike. In the video, Kamulddin said the plan was hatched in Pakistan by the Haqqani network, a militant group with ties to al Qaeda and the Taliban. An NDS spokesman confirmed the network ordered the assault and confirmed that the attack was planned outside of Afghanistan. About 20 Taliban insurgents entered the presidential palace; the ministries of Finance, Mines and Justice; and the Serena Hotel, an Afghan government spokesman said. NATO-led forces said ""several small explosions"" and gunfire were reported near the Feroshgah-e-Afghan Shopping Center and the Serena Hotel, and later added that ""numerous"" suicide bombers had attacked government buildings close to the presidential palace and the Ministry of Justice. Seized around 24 hours after the strike, Kamulddin said he sheltered suicide attackers in his Kabul house, and the men had weapons and explosive-laden vests. Along with the bombers, there were three or four attack coordinators, Kamulddin said in the video. The Afghan Taliban initially claimed responsibility for the blast, but Kamulddin said the plan was organized in Pakistan by the Haqqani network, a group with cross-border ties to Taliban militants and believed to be behind a majority of the suicide attacks in the country. The network has a presence in southeastern Afghanistan and the Pakistani tribal region. NDS spokesman Sayed Ansari also said the NDS arrested five people for their alleged roles in other attacks, including a September 2 bombing that killed Abdullah Abdullah Laghmani, the deputy head of the NDS. Raids across Afghanistan late Monday and Tuesday led to the detention of insurgents, the discovery of weapons and the killing of at least one militant, according to releases from NATO's International Security Assistance Force. ISAF forces killed ""several armed insurgents ""on Tuesday in Konar province, in eastern Afghanistan with an airstrike targeting insurgents seen ""maneuvering to a fighting position previously used to stage attacks."" International forces have been bulking up their troop presence in recent months to counter militants. In the latest move, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany will send 500 more troops to Afghanistan to work in security and training. ISAF said that nation has more than 4,200 troops in the country. --CNN's Atia Abawi and Tim Schwarz contributed to this report .","Taliban claims responsibility for attack near U.S. base outside Kabul .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan may set standards for long-term radiation exposure that would effectively extend the evacuation zone around the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a top government official said Thursday, as a strong new aftershock rattled the area . Government readings show that people beyond the current restricted zone may be exposed to dangerous long-term doses of radiation even though the readings fall below levels that now require an evacuation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said. ""It is the time for the government to consider setting another category for accumulated exposure,"" Edano, the government's point man on the crisis, told reporters Thursday evening. ""The safety of the people is the first priority, and social needs come after that."" There is no timetable for a decision, Edano said. Residents within a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) radius of the Fukushima Daiichi plant were ordered to leave their homes in the days following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out the plant's power systems. Those living within 20 to 30 kilometers have been told to remain indoors. But readings released Thursday by the country's science ministry from areas outside that zone indicated that long-term exposure could top the government's one-time standards for an evacuation within a few months. Some of those are in towns to the northwest, where prevailing winds have blown radioactive particles released from the Fukushima Daiichi plant. ""We have been asking a team of the specialists about setting the line to evacuate by accumulated exposure to radiation,"" Edano said. The recorded doses are far below those that would cause radiation sickness but could pose a long-term risk of cancer, according to medical experts. The anti-nuclear group Greenpeace and the International Atomic Energy Agency raised alarms about the spread of radioactivity beyond the 30-kilometer zone in late March. Current regulations require an evacuation after radiation levels exceed 50 millisieverts in a short period of time. But cumulative doses in one area near Fukushima Daiichi have already topped 12 millisieverts in the month since the accident, and several readings are roughly double the 3 millisieverts a resident of a typical industrialized country receives in a year, according to science ministry data. Edano said the government is also considering whether to allow the roughly 78,000 people who have been forced to evacuate the area around the plant to return temporarily, ""but it is not easy, because we need to secure their safety."" Troops and police who have been working in the area are wearing protective clothing and equipment, ""so it is not realistic that they can go anywhere, anytime,"" he said. At the damaged plant, engineers began injecting non-flammable nitrogen into the No. 1 reactor Thursday to counter a buildup of potentially explosive hydrogen. That work continued even after a strong aftershock rattled much of central Japan shortly before midnight, the plant's owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, reported early Friday. The nine workers in the plant retreated to an earthquake-resistant shelter during the temblor, and the plant never lost power, the utility said. The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake was a magnitude of 7.4. The U.S. Geological Survey said it was 7.1. Hydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheated fuel rods in the cores of the reactors, which plant workers have been struggling to keep under control since the earthquake and tsunami. The nitrogen injections are aimed at displacing oxygen in the reactor shell, reducing the possibility of an explosion -- a chance Tokyo Electric called ""extremely low."" A hydrogen explosion blew the roof and upper walls off the No 1. reactor building two days after the quake, and another blast two days later blew apart the No. 3 building. A suspected hydrogen explosion is believed to have damaged the No. 2 reactor on March 15 as well. Tokyo Electric and Japanese regulators believe No. 2 is the source of the highly contaminated water they are now struggling to contain at Fukushima Daiichi, 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Plant workers are pouring 8 tons of water (2,100 gallons) into that reactor every hour to keep it cool, and the water that flows out carries extremely high concentrations of radioactive particles. That highly radioactive fluid is building up in the turbine plant and the service tunnels around the unit, leaving Japanese officials grasping for ways to contain it. Until Wednesday, some of that water had been bleeding out into the Pacific Ocean through a cracked utility shaft behind the plant. On Saturday, the day the leak was discovered, concentrations of the reactor byproduct iodine-131 in seawater next to the shaft were 7.5 million times higher than the legal limit, according to sampling data taken by the utility. Those levels prompted Japanese authorities to start dumping nearly 10,000 tons of less-radioactive water into the Pacific on Monday night, largely to make room in a waste treatment reservoir for the No. 2 reactor coolant. The move enraged the country's fishing industry and drew protests from neighboring South Korea, but Japan's government called it an emergency move to prevent a worse discharge. Japan is currently consulting with Russian authorities on whether a shipborne decontamination plant has the capability to handle the wastewater, the Japanese Foreign Ministry told CNN on Thursday. But Tokyo has not yet asked for the vessel to be brought into the fight, said Tomosaburo Esaki, an official with the ministry's arms control and disarmament division. The ship, the Suzeran (Lily of the Valley), can process up to 35 tons of radioactive waste a day and store about 800 tons. Japan built the vessel for Russia in the 1990s to help Moscow take aging nuclear submarines out of service. Sergey Novikov, a spokesman for Russia's state-run nuclear energy company, Rosatom, told CNN that, ""The ball is now in their court."" ""We have responded to their questions regarding the plant, and they sent us their additional questions, to which we responded as well,"" Novikov said. ""They are still studying this issue, and we hope to hear from them soon."" Reactors 1 to 3 are believed to have suffered damage to the fuel assemblies at their cores from overheating after the quake and tsunami knocked out cooling systems at Fukushima Daiichi. Stopping the flow of radioactive water from No. 2 was a victory for plant workers, but Tokyo Electric and a top Japanese official warned the fight is far from over. Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said Wednesday that the now-contained water ""may lead to more leakage somewhere else,"" and the utility said Thursday that the water level in the basement of the unit's turbine plant had gone up about 4 centimeters (0.8 inches) since the leak was plugged. The company says temporary storage tanks that can hold another 15,000 tons of water are expected to arrive late next week, but will need to be connected to pumps and water lines before they can be put to use.

"NEWPORT NEWS, Virginia (CNN) -- A federal bankruptcy judge has denied the Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan presented by suspended NFL quarterback Michael Vick. Football player Michael Vick listens as his lawyers make the case for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro urged Vick, 28, to offer the Eastern District of Virginia Bankruptcy Court another plan for emerging from bankruptcy. ""Put together a plan that's doable,"" Santoro said. ""This plan does not work."" Santoro said the plan called for Vick to come up with $750,000 to $1 million in ""good, hard cash"" to be paid to creditors on the day it would go into effect, but he saw no evidence that Vick could come up with that much money. ""Your plan puts you below zero,"" Santoro told Vick. He suggested Vick liquidate some of his assets, including two houses and three cars, which Vick said he was going to keep in the rejected proposal. Vick tried to sell one of his mansions in the upscale Sugarloaf Country Club Community in Georgia earlier this month. The home was up on the auction block, but no one submitted the minimum $3.2 million bid. Vick is scheduled to return Monday to the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, but his lawyers said they need him in Virginia to help devise another plan. The judge's ruling comes a day after Vick's lawyer said the suspended quarterback will go to work for a construction company in Newport News, Virginia, after he leaves federal prison for bankrolling a dogfighting operation. The details emerged in a Chapter 11 confirmation hearing in Virginia Eastern Bankruptcy Court to determine how Vick, 28, will work his way out of bankruptcy. Vick's 23-month sentence ends in July, but he is expected to be released from the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, in May and serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement, most likely in Virginia. He is a native of Newport News. The sports agent who landed Vick's landmark 10-year, $140 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons also testified that he expects Vick will be back in the game as soon as September -- if the National Football League reinstates him. Vick is in great shape and could once again command millions of dollars if he returns to football, Joel Segal told the court. The decision to reinstate Vick rests with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, with whom Segal said he had consulted. Vick was suspended from the NFL after his conviction but remains under contract with the Falcons, Segal said, though he does not expect the Falcons to retain Vick's rights if he is reinstated. Vick and many of his creditors are depending on a return to football as his main source of income. But Segal admitted that he has no way of knowing whether Vick will be reinstated, because the decision lies with Goodell. In the meantime, Vick is ready to ""get back in the community in a positive light"" and demonstrate remorse for his actions, Segal said. He has agreed to participate in a documentary about him that will net him $600,000, Segal said. He will also work 40 hours a week for W.M. Jordan, a construction company based in Newport News. The employment is not part of the official 61-page agreement tentatively worked out between's Vick's lawyers and numerous creditors. CNN's Eric Fiegel contributed to this report.","NEW: Judge to Vick: ""Put together a plan that's doable,"" liquidate some assets .

"(CNN) -- I clung white-knuckled to the back of my friend's motorbike as the two of us zipped around the streets of Hanoi. We buzzed past a man sitting in a barber's chair on the sidewalk of a main road. The man was peering into an oval mirror tacked to a tree as the barber clipped away. ""See! O.I.V!"" my friend said. ""What?"" I asked, trying to figure out what I had seen as much as what he just said. ""O.I.V.,"" he repeated. ""Only in Vietnam."" It was the first day of my 11-day tour through northern and central Vietnam, and the adventure had just begun. Vietnam was never at the top of my list of places to visit -- that is until my old roommate from Atlanta took a job in Hanoi. When my rock-climbing partner, with a level of sanity as questionable as my own, found out climbing was on our itinerary, he decided to join in. We'd start in Hanoi and take in the city sights, make our way to Cat Ba Island for a little climbing and finally to Hoi An along the central coast for some relaxation. Hanoi at street level . We flew in to the capital, where traffic signals and street signs, if they exist, seem more like suggestions than law. The streets are the heart and soul of Hanoi. They're where people gather for everything from dinner to shoe repair, and the only way to take in the city is to plunge into the traffic. So we did, starting with a walking tour of the Old Quarter. Roughly 1,000 years old, the Old Quarter developed as craftsmen gathered around the old palace to peddle their wares. The narrow streets eventually became the central marketplace and business area, but it retains much of its ancient charm. The buildings are only a few stories tall, narrow and deep, and artisans and merchants still line the sidewalks. The streets are named after what you may find on them -- tinwork on Hang Thiec and silk on Hang Gai. Hang Dau was once home to fragrant oil merchants, but now tourists and locals walk the street looking for a great deal on shoes. After watching a tinsmith melt and mold what appeared to be a sprinkler head, another wonder of the Hanoi streets caught my eye, or rather my taste buds. On the balcony of a coffee shop near the Old Quarter, I had my first sip of cafÃ© sua da -- Vietnamese iced coffee. It is dark and thick like espresso, but served iced and creamed with a couple of spoonfuls of sweetened condensed milk. I was addicted at first sip. Climbing on Cat Ba Island . One taxi, three buses and a speedboat away from Hanoi we found the small island of Cat Ba in Halong Bay. Halong Bay was named one of the New Seven Wonders of Nature in 2011 and is easily recognized by the hundreds of limestone karsts that jut sharply out of the turquoise waters. Where much of the area has watered down the wilderness experience to cater to tourists, Cat Ba attracts a more low-maintenance traveler -- the ""TÃ¢y ba lÃ´."" ""It means 'Western backpacker,' "" my friend explained. ""But it also means they think you're cheap."" Cat Ba is a popular spot for backpackers from all over the world who have developed a reputation for their stinginess. Accommodations are basic, and prices are low. Tall, narrow hotels line the main road, each with an amazing view of the harbor. Rooms go for dollars a day, and the cafes feature fresh seafood on the cheap. But the real draw of the island is away from the main drag, so our first morning we caught a ride on a tourist boat to a beachside climbing site. As we meandered through the waters of the bay, a unique nautical culture revealed itself. Because the land is often too rocky to cultivate but the bay is rich in sea life, locals have made the water their home. Large networks of floating villages hide in the shadows of the karsts. Brightly colored huts are built on grids of floating barrels and beams with frontyards made of fishing nets. Our boat dropped anchor off the shore of a deserted beach. We loaded our climbing gear onto kayaks and paddled over. We scaled the jagged walls of Tiger and Moody's beaches in solitude, taking in the beauty of Halong Bay from the top of the vertical cliffs. In addition to experiencing the bay's natural beauty, you can't help but stumble upon history. We explored the island during a break between climbing routes and found a natural cave with a man-made concrete slab for a floor, most likely created as a hideout during the Vietnam War (or the American War, as it's known in Vietnam). Although I never discovered the history of that exact cave, back on Cat Ba we toured another war-era relic with a local guide. Hospital Cave is a three story, bomb-proof structure built into a natural cave. It was a hospital and a safe house for the Viet Cong during the war, complete with a kitchen, surgical rooms and a theater. We also traded $8 cash for two motorbikes (no rental agreement required) and sped up the windy, lush road to Cannon Fort. Cannon Fort was built in the 1940s and later used during the war. Two cannons remain hidden in its crevices, and it's a spectacular place to take in a sunset. High class in Hoi An . After braving the traffic in the city and the cliffs (and jellyfish) of the bay, I deemed the last part of our trip as R&R time, and the ancient city of Hoi An did not disappoint. Most port cities in Vietnam have met one of two fates: They have either grown into large industrial harbors such as Da Nang or shriveled over time. Hoi An is different. Its narrow streets with lantern-lit storefronts and a fusion of various styles of traditional Asian architecture give it a quaint feel. Two of the city's specialties are clothing and food. The first you can get made to order. The second you can make yourself. Every other storefront in the old town is a tailor's shop where you can design your own clothing, pick the fabrics and have it sewn overnight. If you find the right tailor, you can walk away with quality, high-style clothing made to fit at big-box store prices. As for the food, Hoi An is a unique blend of northern and southern flavors with specialties such as white rose dumplings and the Hoi An pancake. Many of the cafes offer cooking classes so you can master the flavors of the city and take them home with you. Our cooking class started with a tour of the local market, where we picked up a few fresh ingredients and learned about the local food culture. It turns out turmeric will cure all that ails you, according to Vietnamese tradition, and durian -- a very smelly fruit -- is an acquired taste. After a leisurely boat ride, we arrived at the Red Bridge Cooking School. Under its thatched portico, we learned to make rice paper and spring rolls, cook in a clay pot and fry Banh Xeo, a shrimp and rice pancake. Trying to re-create that rice paper turned into an epic disaster back in the States, but for an afternoon, we were masters of the trade. Not for everyone, not forever . From the madness of Hanoi to the untamed beauty of Cat Ba -- each of our destinations offered a unique glimpse into Vietnamese culture. It's not for everyone, but for those willing to brave the unknown, the country is ripe with untapped adventures. Hurry though. Sprawling resorts are popping up, and the booming tourism business has many young people learning how to cater to the nuances of Western culture more often than celebrating their own. Vietnam is a country on the cusp. In another decade, it may be a cookie-cutter tourist oasis.

"(CNN) -- David Cameron's announcement that the UK will hold a referendum on European Union membership if his party wins another election has sparked strong reaction from CNN commenters on what the move could mean for Britain and Europe. Cameron, who gave his remarks in a speech in London on Wednesday, said ""difficult questions"" needed to be asked about Britain's membership in the EU, otherwise British people could ""drift towards the exit"" as Europe fails. He also asserted the British people's right to a choice about whether to remain in the EU on the basis of a renegotiated settlement, or to leave. Some praised Cameron for a bold move that they argued protected UK interests and reasserted the nation's power. ""No member state should agree to be part of the European Union if it considers the terms and long term prospects to not be in its favor, why should it?"" argued TomJT. ""[He] is fighting for what the UK needs and sees the value in being part of a strong Europe, but ultimately [also] the impact of losing control of the Stock Exchange and being subject to the voting whims of countries that don't understand the island economy."" Commenter SwissSteve agreed, saying he saw ""a lot of sense and potential leadership in Cameron's speech"". ""The EU needs changes and if it changes for the worse (which is possible with the current level of democratic accountability), then the UK should, and will, waste no time in changing direction,"" he said. But others decried the decision as a bluff, or a move to pander to more skeptical elements in Cameron's own country -- and party -- and questioned whether the move was part of a genuine desire for change in the Union. ""This is a statement of populist politics and fear of losing his chair. They will never leave the EU,"" said commenter Ss. Can the Eurozone recover in 2013 . Some also felt that the move was unfair for other nation members of the Union. ""I am not opposed to change in the EU, but this change can not be dictated by the UK (or any other single state for that matter),"" said commenter Chri Sto. ""It has to come via a democratic process in which all member states are able to represent their individual standpoints. Threatening to leave the EU in case they do not conform with your ideas ... is not the way."" The ""Europe question"" has long dominated UK politics and proved a constant headache for successive UK prime ministers. Cameron has also faced heavy pressure in recent months from some members of his own party to hold a referendum on EU membership. But political rivals, and other factions within his own party, fear that the move could prove poor timing as the country struggles to emerge from its financial troubles. Commenter maxb500 echoed these concerns, describing the move as ""laughable at best"" and potentially catastrophic for the UK's slumping economy. ""You wonder why Cameron thinks he can single handily direct the whole EU what direction to take, while always giving insult after insult after insult about its existence, the Euro currency and much more."" Europe's decade of boom and bust . Other commenters were even more cynical . ""Typical English whining and bluffing,"" scoffed commenter Rikardo_35. ""They think they play at poker? Game over."" While Rikardo_35 dismissed Cameron's move as pure politicking, others wondered whether instability would be the result of any decision to leave the union. disqus_Wuqf7D1NNP, a British national living in Germany, said questions had to be asked about what Cameron was ""offering for sustainability in the way of moving forward"", and feared the result of any economic uncertainty. ""If the economy dives, the violence we saw in the riots in the cities just recently in England will be ten fold in comparison to the fall out which could follow,"" said. ""Add that to the cuts in policing [and] you have a major recipe for disaster."" Cameron used his speech to talk of an ""updated"" union, which he envisioned as flexible, adaptable, open and ""fit for the challenges of the modern age"". His remarks echoed those of some commenters, who argued, as commenter GaÃ«l Christophe Mockelyn did, that the real problem could be the EU itself. ""The problem with the European Union is that they want to become the new United States, but they can't understand it would be never that way, because we are too different from each other,"" he wrote. ""The EU is a patchwork, a forced patchwork of different people, different cultures and different ways of thinking. How can you hope to harmonize it?"" Commenter Badrobot was even harsher in assessment, asking whether the institution itself, which won the 2012 Nobel peace prize, was rapidly falling into obsolescence. ""The European Union is a project, i.e. a colony of France. Sooner or later it will fall apart,"" he said.","British PM had said 'difficult questions' needed to be asked about Britain's EU membership .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The drama that is Hollywood's awards season reaches its midpoint Sunday night with the 19th annual Screen Actors Guild honors -- the only industry awards that solely recognize performers. Will Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" regain its best picture front-runner status lost when Ben Affleck's ""Argo"" won at the Golden Globes two weeks ago? Who will take the best actor SAG trophy -- ""Lincoln"" star Daniel Day-Lewis or Hugh Jackman for ""Les Miserables""? Both men won best-actor Golden Globes this month. The SAG Awards, which are decided exclusively by actors, are distinguished from the Globes, which are chosen by a group of about 80 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. The five film SAG awards traditionally set the stage for the Oscars, voted by about 8,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, to be handed out four weeks later. The SAG ceremony at the Shrine Exposition Center in Los Angeles also includes eight primetime television categories, a followup to the Globes and last fall's Emmys. The live telecast aired on TNT and TBS should offer emotional moments, especially when Carl Reiner and Alec Baldwin present television legend Dick Van Dyke with the SAG 49th Life Achievement Award. The race for best picture . A win by ""Lincoln"" or ""Les Miserables"" in SAG's top category -- officially known as ""Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture"" -- would create important buzz for the film in the Academy Awards best-pic battle. ""Les Miserables,"" a big-screen adaptation of the smash Broadway musical, was given the Golden Globe for best comedy or musical movie, although ""Lincoln"" lost to ""Argo"" in the Globe's best drama film competition.

This category pits Jessica Chastain, who played the CIA analyst who helped track down Osama bin Laden in Kathryn Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" against Jennifer Lawrence, nominated for the romantic comedy ""Silver Linings Playbook.""

Naomi Watts, who played a mother who survived the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in ""The Impossible,"" is also in the running for the SAG and Oscar best actress honors. Marion Cotillard -- ""Rust and Bone"" -- and Helen Mirren -- ""Hitchcock"" -- round out the SAG competition but were not nominated for an Oscar. Best supporting actor in a film .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Using a Facebook profile, police arrested a suspect in an attack on the Georgetown University campus. The victim searched through Facebook profiles to identify his attacker. The university sophomore appeared in court Friday, charged in connection to what police called a hate-crime attack near campus nearly two weeks ago. Phillip Anderton Cooney of Southlake, Texas, is charged with simple assault with a bias/hate crime specification, according to police officials and an official in the U.S. attorney's office. Prosecutors added the ""bias/hate crime specification"" to the case because the victim, a 19-year-old who is also a Georgetown student, said the attacker was yelling homophobic epithets during the attack. The victim was attacked on September 9 just off campus near the intersection of 36th and O streets in the Georgetown neighborhood. Police said he suffered cuts and bruises to the face and a broken thumb in the attack. After the attack, the victim started looking on Facebook to see if he could find the person who attacked him, according to Lt. Alberto Jova of the Metropolitan Police Department's Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit. When he found a profile of someone who looked like his attacker, police investigated, then created a photo spread of possible suspects. The victim picked Cooney's photo from the photo spread and Washington police worked with Georgetown University Public Safety officers to arrest him. Cooney was taken into custody by a University Public Safety officer during an exam. Jova said he'd never heard of a crime victim using Facebook to help police catch a suspect before. The ""hate/bias specification"" means if convicted, he could face a stiffer maximum sentence. A misdemeanor simple assault conviction is punishable by up 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. With the specification for a hate/bias crime, the maximum would be 270 days in jail and $1,500, according to Channing Phillips, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. Georgetown University is investigating the incident and will consider whether Cooney has violated the University's Student Code of Conduct. Spokeswoman Julie Green Bataille said that could lead to any number of sanctions against Cooney, including expulsion from Georgetown. But until that investigation is over, Cooney will be allowed to return to class. Neither Georgetown University nor the Metropolitan Police Department's Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit has released the victim's name.

"(CNN) -- Police believe they found the skeletal remains of a 3-year-old Alabama boy and were charging his father with two counts of murder as they prepared to search for the man's missing young daughter, also believed dead, authorities said Wednesday. Authorities are working to verify the remains found Wednesday near Vancleave, Mississippi, belong to Jonathan Chase DeBlase. Police believe he was killed by his father, John Joseph DeBlase, 27, and the father's girlfriend. Jonathan had not been seen since June, police in Mobile, Alabama, said. Investigators believe he was slain around that time. His sister, 4-year-old Natalie, was last seen in March, when authorities believe she was killed. Earlier, police had reversed the order of the last sightings of the children, but they clarified that timeline Wednesday. Police, who did not know the children were missing until November 19, contend that the elder DeBlase allowed the girlfriend, Heather Keaton, to abuse the children by restraining them with tape, putting socks in their mouths and confining them. The boy's skeletal remains were found about 12 miles north of Vancleave, after the boy's father -- who is in police custody in Alabama -- gave authorities information on where the body might be buried, said Jackson County, Mississippi, Sheriff Mike Byrd. ""It was the father who gave us the general area,"" Byrd told HLN. ""He wasn't real sure exactly where he was. ... He claimed he had taken a lot of sleeping pills and didn't quite remember exactly where he was."" Based on that information, the sheriff's office cordoned off a five-mile stretch along a highway and dispatched eight 10-man teams to locate the remains. The body was found about 10:30 a.m., Byrd said. ""We're very certain"" the remains are that of the missing boy, Byrd said. ""We're just thankful that we found this little boy. Nothing's left but just the skeletal remains."" The body of Natalie DeBlase has not been found, Byrd said, but he indicated authorities believe it near Citronelle, Alabama, about 50 miles north of Mobile. A spokesman for Mobile Police told HLN that prosecutors are signing two murder warrants against John DeBlase. Authorities will decide in the next few days whether to charge Keaton in the deaths, Officer Christopher Levy said. Police believe both children died in Mobile, Levy said. Levy was not sure when the search for Natalie near Citronelle will begin in earnest. ""This is a one-step-at-a-time, one-day-at-a-time operation,"" Levy said. ""We've had some success with it today. We're going to evaluate our results, then begin the next step."" Levy said he was relieved at the new findings, but said the investigation had taken a toll. ""I have kids that are of similar age and it makes me think about them while I'm out here,"" Levy told HLN. Investigators believe that after Jonathan's death, John DeBlase, Keaton and Natalie continued to live in the Peach Place Apartments in Mobile for months, Levy said Monday. They didn't leave until the summer, after Natalie was last seen in June. ""It's really terrible, as if nobody really cared,"" Levy said of the time that transpired between the sightings and launch of the search. ""That's what we can't seem to understand at this point."" Both DeBlase and Keaton are now in custody, and blaming each other for the siblings' deaths. The investigation kicked off November 18, when Keaton told Louisville, Kentucky, police that she needed protection from DeBlase, who she claimed was holding her against her will. According to the domestic violence petition, signed ""Heather L. Leavell-Keaton,"" she said, ""I feel he may have murdered his children, because he said they were non-responsive. He would not let me check on them."" She said DeBlase had told her ""choices were made ... and he had to do what he had to do."" Keaton was arrested last week, charged with two counts of willful abuse and neglect of a child. Three days later, Randall Melville -- who for two days had been hosting DeBlase, his longtime friend -- called Santa Rosa County, Florida, police after hearing news reports about the children's disappearance, according to a report from the county sheriff's department. When Melville asked DeBlase about it, the children's father yelled, ""I didn't do it"" and left the home, the report said. Police eventually tracked down DeBlase, who again asserted his innocence before his arrest Friday. He had been charged with two counts of aggravated child abuse and two counts of abuse of a corpse -- the latter because, Levy said, of his ""disposing of the bodies in the woods."" DeBlase had a first appearance on the abuse charges Wednesday and a judge entered a not guilty plea, said Jim Sears, who was assigned to represent the father at the Mobile proceedings. Sears described his client as being very upset about developments. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for January 4. On Monday, Mobile County District Judge Charles McKnight set bail for DeBlase at $206,000 -- $100,000 each for the child abuse charges and $3,000 for each count of corpse abuse, according to CNN affiliate WALA. According to a police complaint, DeBlase between March 1 and November 19 allowed Keaton to tape Natalie's hands and feet, put a sock in her mouth and place her in a suitcase that was put in a closet for 14 hours. He also allowed Keaton to tape Jonathan's hands to the side of his legs, tape a broom handle to his back, place a sock in his mouth and then make the child stand in a corner all night when the couple went to bed. DeBlase and Keaton had one infant daughter together, according to Keaton's account in the Kentucky police report. Police said one reason Keaton claimed she needed protection from DeBlase was that she feared for the safety of the infant, who was with her in Kentucky. Levy said the two slain children's biological mother lives in Mobile, but she did not have custody ""because, at the time, she didn't have a place to live."" CNN's  Natisha Lance, Vivian Kuo, Beth Carey and Andy Rose contributed to this report.","Father is being charged with murder .
