"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 20:05 EST, 18 January 2012 . Son of Barnsley: James Hudson Taylor is the 19th Century missionary who took Christianity to China . It's a strange and bold ambition, but the people of Barnsley are hoping to become a Christian pilgrimage destination on a scale to rival Lourdes. Tourism chiefs are launching a major push to attract an astonishing 70 million Chinese Christians who revere the South Yorkshire mining town as the birthplace of 19th century missionary James Hudson Taylor. Hudson Taylor is the man who took Christianity to China and is responsible for the fact that there are more Christians there than there are people in Britain. Barnsley already attracts a few Chinese Christian tourists who pay homage to Hudson Taylor - who is little known in the rest of Britain - but is . planning to go on the offensive to attract them in droves. John . Foster, who runs Foster’s Bakery and is chairman of the Barnsley Work . and Skills Board, said Chinese tourism could revive the local economy. He said: 'More than 50 per cent of the . overseas tourists visiting Britain are Chinese and they are already . visiting places like York and Haworth. Heritage: The South Yorkshire town is well-known for its mining history. The former leader of the miners' union Arthur Scargill was born here . 'They’ve got spending power and are visiting in massive numbers. 'There . are more Christians in China and the Far East who owe their heritage to . James Hudson Taylor than there are people in Britain. 'And Barnsley has this unique claim to attract them. 'It could be a place of religious interest like Canterbury or Lourdes.' Tourist destination: Town hall bosses hope to attract visitors to the town's market as they pay homage to the birthplace of James Hudson Taylor . Hudson was born in 1832 in Barnsley, and although the son of a Methodist minister. only became a Christian as a teenager. After his conversion he developed a deep passion for China and decided at the tender age of 17 to make it his life's work to 'evangelise all China, to preach Christ to all its peoples by any and all means'. In preparation he joined the Chinese Evangelization Society and began medical training, but sailed to Shanghai at the age of 21 before he finished his studies. He insisted on dressing and living like the Chinese people, which made him an oddity at the time. He even shaved the front of his head and grew a pigtail like Chinese men. After six years in China he returned to England because of ill health, now married to missionary teacher Maria Dyer, and decided to start a new mission society, the China Inland Mission. All members would wear Chinese dress and work in interior villages and cities that previously did not have any missionary work. The organisation's name was later changed to the Chinese . Overseas Mission Fellowship. In 1866, the first 16 CIM missionaries joined Hudson, Maria, and their two children on the boat to Shanghai. Many had joined CIM after hearing Hudson's dynamic speaking. In time the CIM grew to more than 1,300 missionaries. Altogether Hudson spent of 50 years in China, losing his wife, three children and later dying there himself in 1905. Hudson Taylor was buried in the Protestant cemetery in Zhenjiang which was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. In 1988 his great-grandson, James Taylor III, discovered the tombstone in Zhenjiang Museum. The remainder of the memorial - erected by the CIM - was discovered later, intact and was re-erected inside a nearby church in 1999. There is also a plaque commemorating Taylor Hudson's work on a house in Pyrland Road, Highbury, London, which was used as a base for the mission in this country. Hudson Taylor's descendants have continued his legacy in Asia. His eldest son Herbert also served there for over 50 years – the last three as a prisoner of the Japanese at the Weifang internment camp during World War II along with Olympic gold-medallist and missionary Eric Liddell, who died there. Herbert Hudson Taylor's grandson - James Hudson Taylor III - continued his ministry, in Hong Kong and Taiwan. He died in 2009. His son James Hudson Taylor IV is currently operations director of OMF International Chinese ministries. Born in Barnsley in 1832, Hudson Taylor made it his life's work to take Christianity to the Chinese, spending more than 50 years there and leaving a legacy which is carried on by his descendants to this day. He founded the Chinese . Overseas Mission Fellowship, which now has a 70 million-strong membership of . Christian churches in China and the Asian Pacific region. Barnsley's James Hudson Taylor group wants to erect up to 12 plaques in his honour. Last month a group of about 15 Chinese . Christians visited the town and went to the Salem Wesleyan Reform Church in Blucher Street, . where there is a plaque to commemorate the missionary work of Hudson Taylor. They also visited nearby Cheapside where Hudson Taylor was born and where the family ran a chemist, where Boots now stands. Group member Michael Rossiter and Jenifer Dore helped show them around. Mr Rossiter said: 'One kissed the ground outside Boots. They refer to Barnsley as their spiritual home. 'James . Hudson Taylor should be a famous son of Barnsley. 'He’s left a legacy . that Barnsley would do well to look closely at and build on. 'As Christians we are concerned about the well-being of the town. One of the obvious ways to boost it is through tourism.' Plaques are planned for Boots, a house at . Paddock Close, Staincross, where Hudson-Taylor's descendants lived, and another at . the top of Old Mill Lane which they moved to. There will also be a permanent exhibition at the new Experience Barnsley museum in the town hall. Barnsley Council leader Steve Houghton said he was grateful for the work the group was doing. He said: 'I hadn’t realised the importance of James Hudson Taylor in China. 'If people are interested in coming to see that heritage, then fantastic.' A council spokesman said officers . would work with any community groups interested in raising the profile . of ‘this inspirational man’s work’. She . said: 'Growth in the visitor economy of the borough is an important . priority for the authority and clearly the story of James Hudson Taylor . has the potential to attract more national and international visitors to . Barnsley.' Gary Verity, Chief Executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, said the plan was interesting. 'We are always interested to hear . about unique and creative ways or attracting even more overseas visitors . to Barnsley and the rest of our great county,' he said. 'Latest stats show the value of international trips to Yorkshire went up by 22 per cent and visits rose by 16 per cent. So ideas like this could help . encourage even more visitors from China to come and experience this . trail in Barnsley - and Yorkshire’s wider, unrivalled tourism offer - . which would help boost the county’s tourism economy.'

"By . Daniel Bates . UPDATED: . 13:36 EST, 18 January 2012 . David Letterman has fired his comedy booker from ‘The Late Show’ after he made sexist remarks about female comedians. Eddie Brill was sacked after saying he doesn’t like to get women comics on the show because they ‘act like men to please an audience’. In an interview he also claimed that fewer women comics were ‘authentic’ - sparking a firestorm of criticism on the Internet. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Last comic standing: Eddie Brill, who booked comics for The Late Show with David Letterman, was fired for sexist remarks . Brill was fired by CBS for ‘speaking to the press without authorisation’ but Letterman himself, who has made a career lambasting public figures for their indiscretions, would have been sensitive to appearing out of touch with women. In 2009 he was forced to admit a relationship with a female member of his staff on his show after somebody tried to blackmail him for $2million to keep it quiet. The workplace indiscretion aside, many were shocked with the causal way he announced his infidelity in a 10-minute speech in which he offered no apology. Then there was the fact he was going out with his wife-to-be Regina Lasko who had been dating for the previous 23 years. Who's laughing now: Brill was fired for his insensitivity, but Letterman was under fire in 2009 for having an affair with a female staffer . They later had a son together. It was an interview with the New York Times which forced out Brill, who was the warm-up comedian for Letterman as well as booking other comics. He said: ‘There are a lot less female comics who are authentic. I see a lot of female comics who to please an audience will act like men.’ Among those who responded to his comments was comedian Amy Schumer who said that Brill only likes ‘middle-aged white men from the Midwest’. The New York Times reported that 'The Late Show' booked just one woman during the whole of 2011. He certainly has a type: Comedian Amy Schumer said Brill only likes ¿middle-aged white men from the Midwest¿ . Six days after the piece was published Brill, 53, was fired. Letterman has yet to comment on the episode but viewers will be reminded of his monologue in which he admitted to having sex with a female co-worker, later identified as his former assistant Stephanie Birkitt. In a matter-of-fact voice he told them: ‘I have had sex with women who worked on this show. ‘And would it be embarrassing if it were made public? Perhaps it would. Especially for the women.’ He also gave details of how he felt ‘menaced’ by the man who tried to blackmail him. Letterman gave him a bogus cheque for $2million and notified the authorities. Coming to his defense: Actress Lisa Lampanelli said Brill is entitled to his own opinions . Veteran CBS producer Robert Halderman was arrested and later jailed for six months under a plea deal which banned him from making public diary entries made by Birkitt about her affair with Letterman. Brill’s post will be filled by other producers on Letterman’s show. He was given support by female comic Lisa Lampanelli who said she had had no problems with him or ‘The Late Show’. She said: ‘I was really surprised and unhappy about that. ‘It’s funny how you can get fired for an opinion. He should be allowed to say what he wants.' Brill was not available for comment.","Comedian Eddie Brill said female comedians 'act like men to please an audience'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:50 EST, 19 January 2012 . U.S. President Obama reportedly 'made threats and demanded talks' with Iran . The White House has denied calling for direct talks with Iran in a 'secret letter' to the country's supreme leader. A conservative Iranian lawmaker had claimed that Barack Obama was trying to open back-channel negotiations with the leadership of the Islamic Republic. But yesterday a White House official said that Mr Obama had not sent a letter to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He added that the U.S. government was continuing to use other diplomatic channels to dissuade Iran from shutting down the strategic Strait of Hormuz. Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the crucial route connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, where about one-sixth of the global oil flows through, because of new U.S. sanctions over its nuclear program. Iran's Revolutionary Guard, the country's most powerful military force, says Tehran's leadership has decided to order the closure of the oil route if Iran's oil exports are blocked. U.S. military officials have made it clear that the country is preparing itself for a possible naval clash if the route is blocked. Today conservative lawmaker Ali Motahari claimed to know the content of a letter from Mr Obama to the Ayatollah, days after the administration said it was warning Iran through public and private channels against any action that threatens the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf. Warning: Obama is reported to have written to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei about the closure of the Strait . 'In the letter, Obama called for direct talks with Iran,' Fars news agency reported. 'The letter also said that closing the Strait of Hormuz is (Washington's) red line.' 'The first part of the letter contains threats and the second part contains an offer for dialogue,' he added. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman . Ramin Mehmanparast confirmed that Tehran had received the letter and was . considering a possible response. A senior Guard officer said earlier this month that the decision to block the route has been made by Iran's top authorities. Iranian politicians have made the . threat in the past, but this was the strongest statement yet that a . closure of the strait is official policy. Strategic: About one sixth of the world's oil trade flows through the Strait of Hormuz, pictured . As the West made the military threat against Iran, Russia refused to back it, warning that it would trigger a 'chain reaction' that could destabilise the world. Foreign minister  Sergey Lavrov insisted that his country was 'seriously worried' about the sanctions against Tehran over its disputed nuclear program. And he also warned that stifling the country's economy could hurt the Iranian people. Lavrov said: 'The consequences will be extremely . grave,"" he said. ""It's not going to be an easy walk. It will trigger a . chain reaction and I don't know where it will stop.' Concerned: Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned against imposing any sanctions on Iran . The threat of more sanctions as well as the possibility of military action against Iran are linked to concerns about its uranium enrichment program. The U.S. and its Western allies suspect it is aimed at developing nuclear weapons. Iran insists its efforts are designed for civilian power generation and research. Israel considers a nuclear-armed Iran a threat to its survival and has hinted it could take military action if sanctions fail to stop Iran's nuclear bid. The U.S. considers a military strike . on Iran's known nuclear facilities undesirable because it could have . unintended consequences and would likely only stall, not end, Tehran's . nuclear drive. Washington worries that Iran's recent claim that it is expanding nuclear operations might prod Israel closer to a strike. Russia has long walked a fine line on . the Iranian nuclear crisis, mixing careful criticism of Iran, an . important trading partner, with praise for some of its moves and calls . for more talks. Killing: The car of an Iranian scientist was was blown up by a magnetic bomb causing further fury over the nation's nuclear capabilities . Although Moscow, which built Iran's first nuclear power plant, has backed some of the previous U.N. sanctions against Iran, it has in recent months firmly rejected new ones. In a press conference, Lavrov predicted that a military attack on Iran would send refugees streaming into its Caspian Sea neighbor Azerbaijan and further on to Russia, and said it could also 'add fuel to the smoldering confrontation between Sunnis and Shiites.' The Sunni Arab states in the Gulf like Saudi Arabia are close U.S. allies, locked in decades-old rivalries with Iran's Shiite-led Islamic Republic. The U.S. already has imposed new sanctions targeting Iran's central bank and, by extension, refiners' ability to buy and pay for crude. The EU is weighing whether to impose sanctions on buying Iranian oil, which is the source of more than 80 percent of Tehran's foreign revenue. On Wednesday, Spanish Foreign Minister . Jose Manuel Garcia-Margall said his nation will back a possible EU oil . embargo against Iran that would start July 1 even though it would . inflict 'huge damage' on its two major oil importers. Talks: Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi, left, is hoping for resolution having arrived in Istanbul for negotiations . Cash-strapped Greece has indicated it wants to stall any action because it is an importer of Iranian oil and gets the best payment terms from Tehran. EU ambassadors will address the issue Thursday ahead of next Monday's meeting of EU foreign ministers. Lavrov, however, said sanctions on Iranian oil exports have 'nothing to do with a desire to strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation.' 'It's aimed at stifling the Iranian economy and the population in an apparent hope to provoke discontent,' the Russian foreign minister said. Russia believes that 'all conceivable sanctions already have been applied' and that new penalties could derail hopes for continuing six-way negotiations on the Iranian nuclear program, provoking Iranian intransigence, Lavrov said. He noted that the EU's consideration of new sanctions comes as Iran plans to host a delegation from the U.N. nuclear watchdog. 'We believe that there is every chance to resume talks between the six powers and Iran, and we are concerned about obstacles being put to them. 'The sanctions could hardly help make the talks productive,' he said. Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said upon arrival in the Turkish capital that Istanbul is the likely venue for further talks with world powers on his country's nuclear program. He did not give a date for the negotiations, but said Turkey is in touch with Iranian and EU officials. Meanwhile, Iran's official IRNA news agency said a senior security official, Ali Bagheri, headed to Moscow for talks with Lavrov and other Russian officials .","Obama 'demands talks' with Iran as it threatens to shut strategic Strait of Hormuz over West sanctions, says Iranian lawmaker .

"By . George Mair and Rebecca Seales . UPDATED: . 04:29 EST, 23 January 2012 . A cast taken from the face of William Shakespeare is to go on display for the first time later this month. The bard's death mask will be shown at the University of Edinburgh's Anatomy Museum from January 28, when it unveils a macabre collection of medical artefacts to the public. Presently on loan from the William Ramsay Henderson Collection, the famous face will soon find a permanent home at the museum. Immortalised in life and death: This painting (right) is believed to date from 1610, when Shakespeare was in his mid-forties. The death mask (left) shows his face as it would have been when he died, aged 52. Visitors can also cast an eye over the death masks of Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott, world-famous physicist Sir Isaac Newton, and King George III. For those who love a ghoulish sight, the haunting facial cast of mass murderer William Burke will be on display alongside his skeleton and items made from his tanned skin. Together with accomplice William Hare, Burke carried out at least 15 murders in the 1820s and sold the bodies for use in anatomy lessons at Edinburgh University. When the pair were caught, Hare was offered immunity from prosecution if he confessed and agreed to testify against his former partner. Burke was sentenced to death by hanging in 1829, and then publicly dissected at the Edinburgh Medical College. The dissecting professor, Alexander Monro, dipped his quill pen into Burke's blood and wrote, 'This is written with the blood of Wm Burke, who was hanged at Edinburgh. This blood was taken from his head.' Face of a genius: Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) scientist and astronomer, was the father of modern physics . Eminent Scot: Edinburgh-born writer Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) wrote historical novels, plays and poems . Edinburgh University's Museum of Anatomy has recently undergone a major revamp, and will re-open on the 183rd anniversary of Burke’s execution. In total more than 40 masks, created from casts taken in both life and death, will be on display. Such masks were popular in the 19th century, when they were used in  the now-discredited practice of phrenology. This postulated that the shape and size of a person’s skull could help explain their mind and behaviour. They fell out of favour as photography became more common, but were sometimes used to preserve the facial features of public figures or unidentified bodies. Exhibit A: Dr Gordon Findlater holds the death mask of mass murderer William Burke, soon to go on public display . Ghoulish: Dr Findlater with William Burke's skeleton, which was previously kept under lock and key . Death mask: This plaster cast of Burke's head will be on display along with preserved corpses and pickled brains . Preserved in plaster: The cast came to light unexpectedly in 2009 after being found in a store cupboard at Inveraray jail in Argyll . Other artefacts at the museum include 19th century anatomical teaching models made from wax and wood, as well as a preserved body from the late 1790s, which is exhibited alongside an etching carried out when the remains were embalmed. Visitors to the museum at the Teviot Medical School, which opened in 1884, will also be able to see the historic anatomy lecture theatre. Gordon Findlater of the university’s anatomy department said: ‘The museum provides a fascinating insight into how anatomy has progressed from the late 1700s to the present day.’ The Anatomy Museum, in Teviot Place, Edinburgh, will be open to the public on the last Saturday of every month, from 10am-4pm, starting on January 28.",Death masks of Sir Walter Scott and Sir Isaac Newton also on display at University of Edinburgh’s Anatomy Museum .
"Texana Hollis was evicted from her home last September when her son failed to pay taxes . Charity brought the house and renovated it allowing Hollis to be home by next week . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 17:14 EST, 30 March 2012 . A 101-year-old woman could do nothing but pray for help when she was evicted from her house last September. And six months later Texana Hollis’s prayers have finally been answered and she is getting ready to move back into her newly renovated home next week. The centenarian was booted out of her Detroit home of sixty years after her son failed to pay property taxes and it was foreclosed. Home sweet home: 101-year-old Texana Hollis is returning to the home she was evicted from six months ago . Relying on friends: Texana Hollis, 101, lived with her friend Pollian Cheeks after being evicted six months ago - here she talks to Cheeks' granddaughter Jahzara . But thanks to numerous charities and individuals determined to help, Hollis will be back home in time to celebrate her 102nd birthday in May. After hearing about the elderly lady’s plight the author Mitch Albom and his homeless charity S.A.Y brought the property for $100 dollars from the HUD with the promise of fixing it up. Through his charities Albom pledged $20,000 to help pay for new walls, floors, ceilings and a roof, a new kitchen and bathroom, carpeting, electric and furnace – with all the work done by volunteers. Prayers answered: A charity brought back Hollis' home and made improvements so she could move back in safely . Hollis said she 'might have to dance' when she returns to her renovated home, according to Chad Audi, president of Detroit Rescue Mission Missionaries, one of the other charities which fought to help her. Last September the centenarian wept in her wheelchair as her life-time possessions were thrown onto a dumpster by bailiffs and she was forced to move in with friends. Two days after she was kicked out, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) said she could return to her home in Detroit. Distraught: Mrs Hollis, 101, was not allowed back into the home where she lived for 60 years because it wasn't safe . However the HUD then retracted the decision saying that Hollis couldn’t move back in to the building because it was unsanitary and unsafe. Hollis said at the time: 'Here I am, 100 years old, and don't have a home. Oh Lord, help me.' After hearing about her friend's eviction, Pollian Cheeks, 68, offered Mrs Hollis a room at her home nearby. Mrs Hollis, who once taught Ms Cheeks in Sunday school at St Philip's Lutheran Church, agreed to the invitation and has been staying with her friend ever since. Officials said her son Warren Hollis had failed to pay property taxes for up to seven years. Although the home was owned outright by Mrs Hollis he had ignored repeated warnings that they faced eviction. Mr Hollis said at the time: ‘I kept it from her because I did not want to worry her.’ Housing problem: Ms Hollis's 65-year-old son Warren, left, had failed to pay property taxes for up to seven years .","Texana Hollis was evicted from her home last September when her son failed to pay taxes .

"By . Andrew Levy . UPDATED: . 08:48 EST, 11 October 2011 . Given the scandal it caused, you might think his drunken antics with an old flame would be the last thing Mike Tindall would want to  joke about. Yet as he boarded a plane home from New Zealand yesterday – after England were dumped out of the Rugby World Cup by France at the weekend – he was all smiles as team mate Manu Tuilagi re-enacted the notorious nightclub encounter. In fact, with their larking about at Auckland airport, the England players had the look of returning champions. They certainly didn’t look like a team ashamed of poor performances on the field and poor behaviour off it. Copycat: Manu Tuilagi mimics the kiss from Jessica Palmer on Mike Tindall at Auckland Airport yesterday . Embarrassing: While in a New Zealand bar Mike Tindall, the newest member of the royal family, was kissed on the head . Tuilagi’s kiss on his team captain’s head was believed to be a reference to the encounter – captured on a nightclub’s CCTV – with old friend Jessica Palmer. Tindall, of course, is newly married to Zara Phillips, the Queen’s grand-daughter. Not that Tuilagi had any reason to be playing the jester. Hours earlier he had been held by police after jumping from the deck of a ferry – the final embarrassment of the trip. The 20-year-old, who came close to being deported from Britain last year for overstaying his visa, was held in Auckland after he jumped from a ferry as it was about to berth and swam ashore, apparently egged on by other players. All smiles: Mike Tindall looks happy as he leaves New Zealand after England's disappointing tournament . His antics came after England were knocked out of the World Cup by France at the quarter-final stage and at the end of a team visit to Waiheke Island, which lies 35 minutes by ferry from Auckland, during which the players and management toured vineyards. It was the latest controversial incident . to involve an England player during the team's ill-fated campaign which . has seen Mike Tindall caught on CCTV kissing a blonde in a Queenstown . nightclub. Three other players were reprimanded for their actions . involving a female member of staff in the team hotel in a separate incident. Other incidents include the suspension . of two players for dangerous play, the suspension of two coaches over . ball-switching against Romania and the fining of Tuilagi for wearing a . gumshield with unauthorised advertising. In big trouble: Manu Tuilagi is spoken to by a security officer after jumping off a ferry in Auckland, which ended with him being fined £3,000 . Evening swim: Tuilagi, circled, makes his way across the harbour from the ferry as people gathered on deck to watch the prank . Tuilagi - considered by many as England's best player during the tournament - jumped from the catamaran ferry, Superflyte, as it prepared to berth at the Auckland waterfront with the defeated England team on board. The Samoan-born player swam a short distance to Pier 3 and while there were shouts of encouragement from many passengers on the ferry, the police were not amused and Tuilagi was taken to Auckland Central police station. He could have been charged with disorderly conduct, but was given a warning and allowed to return to the team hotel. Tuilagi was later seen with other players out at a bar until the small hours. Tuilagi was last night fined £3,000 by the Rugby Football Union. England manager Martin Johnson said: ‘This was an irresponsible thing to do. Manu has been disciplined internally and I have warned him about his future conduct.’ Passionate: Manu Tuilagi, centre, with arm across his chest, sings the national anthem with other members of the England team ahead of the quarter-final with France . Tuilagi added: ‘I’m really sorry. It was a silly thing to do and I apologise to everybody for any inconvenience caused.’ Angry officials of the company that operates the ferry said the incident was ‘extremely dangerous’. Spokesman Warren Fowler said: ‘The ferry had made a turn and was about to reverse to its berth when this happened. ‘It could have been tragic with vessels coming in here and someone jumping off the back of a vessel when it is going to be reversing shortly.’ The prank caps a dismal few weeks for England’s team, where they were criticised for their off-the-pitch antics as much as their woeful on-field performances. Players and fans were left distraught by a 19-12 loss to France in the quarter-finals on Saturday, ironically with several moments of brilliance from Tuilagi preventing a heavier defeat. Kick in the teeth: Tuilagi was fined for wearing this gumshield displaying unauthorised sponsorship . Suspended: Tuilagi was banned for five weeks last season for this punch on Northampton and England's Chris Ashton . The young centre is seen as a future star of the world game, but few of his colleagues return to this country with their reputations intact. Early on in the tour, captain Mike Tindall was caught  flirting with a mystery blonde woman – later revealed to be ex-girlfriend Jessica Palmer – in a bar in Queenstown, just weeks after marrying the Queen’s granddaughter, Zara Phillips. Things got worse when three players – Chris Ashton, James Haskell and Dylan Hartley – were forced to apologise to a female hotel worker for lecherous comments. Tuilagi, whose five older brothers all played rugby for Samoa, last year faced deportation from Britain after it emerged he had entered the country on a tourist visa six years earlier and had stayed on illegally. He was later granted indefinite leave to remain. Before the World Cup he also hit the headlines for striking England team-mate Chris Ashton during a club match between Tuilagi's Leicester and Northampton. Tuilagi was suspended for the clash.

"By . Suzannah Hills . UPDATED: . 16:16 EST, 18 January 2012 . Mother-to-be: Nikitta Grender, 19, who was allegedly raped and killed by her boyfriend's cousin Carl Whant . A young mother-to-be was raped in her own home and repeatedly stabbed - killing her and her unborn baby just two weeks before she was due to give birth, a court heard today. Nightclub bouncer Carl Whant, 27, is accused of raping his cousin's girlfriend, eight-month pregnant Nikitta Grender, 19, before knifing her to death at her home. A jury was told Miss Grender was just two weeks away from giving birth when she was stabbed in the neck and stomach causing the death of her unborn baby already named Kelsey-May. The court heard how Miss Grender was 'looking forward' to the birth of her baby with boyfriend Ryan Mayes, who is Whant’s cousin. The pair were 'well-prepared' for the birth of their baby girl - and had bought a cot and pram ready for the big day. Father-to-be Mr Mayes had gone for a night-out with family and friends but when he returned he discovered Miss Grender dead in the burned-out flat in the Broadmead Park estate of Newport, South Wales. Prosecutor Greg Taylor said: 'Nikitta was alone at home in the flat in the early hours where she should have been safe for the rest of the night. 'Her boyfriend Ryan was out in pubs, nightclubs and a house party with his cousin Whant. 'Someone entered that flat, someone raped her, someone murdered her and in the process destroyed her unborn child. 'She was stabbed right through the neck cutting her carotid artery. 'She was also stabbed in her stomach and the knife penetrated the unborn baby.' The court heard the bed Miss Grender was found lying which was deliberately set on fire. Mr Taylor said: 'This was an attempt to cover up these crimes making it appear Nikitta Grender had died in a tragic house fire. The man who did that was Carl Whant.' Newport Crown Court heard Miss Grender had become pregnant by her long-term boyfriend Ryan, who was just 17 at the time. Mr Taylor said: 'They had been in a relationship for three of four years although they were both still in their teens. 'Nikitta fell pregnant and was expecting her child in February 2011. They moved into a new flat the previous September - Nikitta’s mother lived around the corner to help her out. 'Nikitta visited the midwife regularly with Ryan and they were both looking forward to the birth of their child. 'Nikitta and Ryan knew the baby was going to be a girl and had already given her the name Kelsey-May. 'They had decorated one room in the flat and had bought a cot and pram - they were well prepared. Cousins: Bouncer Carl Whant 27, left, is accused of raping and murdering the girlfriend of his cousin Ryan Mayes, right, killing their unborn baby . 'When Nikitta was killed she was a fortnight off giving birth.' The court that heard that on the night of February 4 last year Ryan went to a pub to watch a rugby match on TV with Carl and other friends and they ended up at a house party. But while he was out, Miss Grender and their unborn baby were killed. Court artist sketch: Carl Whant (rear, centre) at Newport Crown Court, where he stands accused of the rape and murder of eight-month pregnant mum-to-be Nikitta Grender . Forensic tests on her baby showed DNA signs that Whant had sex with Miss Grender. Mr Taylor told how Miss Grender disliked Carl Whant - and ruled out that she had consented to sex with him. He said: 'It was common knowledge that Nikitta disliked Carl Whant - he was a self-confessed cocaine user and she thought he was a bad influence on Ryan.' Firefighters were called to the teenage couple’s flat in Broadmead Park, Newport, after a 999 call from a neighbour. Family: Parents Marcia Grender and Paul Brunnock, left, arriving at Newport Crown Court, South Wales, to watch the trial of Carl Whant who is accused of murdering their daughter, and Miss Grender's boyfriend and father of her unborn child, Ryan Mayes, left, attending an earlier magistrate hearing in Caerphilly . Mr Taylor told how firefighters arrived to see smoke billowing out of the windows of the first-floor flat. Mr Taylor said: 'The fire was started deliberately there is no doubt about that. It was to mask the murder. 'The firefighters broke through the door and inched their way across the floor when a five-foot ball of flame rolled across the ceiling from Nikitta’s bedroom. 'When they got into that room they could see Nikitta’s body on the bed. It was heavily charred.' The court heard Miss Grender was just 5ft 3in and weighed 7st 10lbs even though she was heavily pregnant. Miss Grender's mother Marcia and father Paul were in the public gallery as the jury heard details of the alleged murder. Whant, dressed in a black suit, striped shirt and black tie, took notes as he sat in the dock. Whant, of Bettws, Newport, denies murder, child destruction, rape and arson. The hearing continues at Newport Crown Court.","Miss Grender was just two weeks away from giving birth when she was stabbed in the neck and stomach - killing both her and her unborn baby .

"By . Rebecca Camber . UPDATED: . 21:35 EST, 18 January 2012 . Not so long ago, you were always told that if you wanted to know the time... ask a policeman. Now the chances are you’ll see him calling the Speaking Clock to find out for himself. It emerged yesterday that Britain’s biggest police force has spent more than £250,000 calling the speaking clock and directory enquiries. Time is money: Officers and staff at the Met Police used the talking clock 55,000 times in the past year . Scotland Yard officers and officials made more than 100,000 calls to the premium rate numbers in the last two years alone. New figures show that the Metropolitan Police racked up a £16,879 bill calling the speaking clock nearly 55,000 times last year. A year earlier the call volume was . even higher, with £18,401 spent on almost 60,000 calls to the service, . which costs 31p a time. Yesterday critics said it was . ‘incredible’ that the Met had spent £35,000 on the speaking clock over . the last two years when officers and staff were facing severe budget . cuts. Figures released under the Freedom of . Information Act also show that the force lavished more than £95,000 on . directory enquiries calls last year. That compared with a bill of £121,501 the previous year. But the Met isn’t only the police force landing taxpayers with a huge phone bill for the premium rate numbers. Devon and Cornwall Police spent £1,393 on the speaking clock between 2009 and 2011. The same force paid out £5,990 on directory enquiries in 2010/11, which was down from a £8,028 bill in 2009/10. Leicestershire Police spent £727 on the speaking clock and £11,342 on directory enquiries over the past two years. Matthew Sinclair, director of campaign . group the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is incredible that while there . is real pressure on their budgets, and the taxpayers who pick up the . bill, London police have spent tens of thousands of pounds on directory . enquiries and the talking clock. 'Operational reasons': A Scotland Yard spokesman argued that ringing the premium rate lines was essential for officers and staff who were not office-based and did not have direct internet access . ‘There are plenty of other ways of . checking phone numbers or the time, which should mean these services are . used only in exceptional circumstances and not costing a fortune every . year. ‘The Met need to show proper care when . spending taxpayers’ money and not waste valuable time dawdling on the . phone waiting for the third pip from the talking clock.’ Yesterday a Scotland Yard spokesman . said officers often needed to know the exact time for their . investigations and evidential reasons. A Met Police spokesman said: ‘We are . committed to reducing such costs wherever possible and all directory . enquiries from landline telephones are routed to one service with no . option to be put through directly. ‘It must be remembered however that a . huge number of our officers and staff will not have direct access to the . internet as they are not office-based. ‘There are clearly evidential and operational reasons for officers and staff requiring the exact time and contact details. ‘Whilst officers will usually phone in . for assistance, there will be occasions where other means for finding . out contact information quickly are used.’ The speaking clock was introduced in . Britain in 1936. It takes its time from the National Physics Laboratory . which broadcasts the atomic clock’s time from Rugby, accurate to one . second in one million years. Devon and Cornwall Police said the speaking clock was used to ‘synchronise telecoms systems’. A spokesman said: ‘Because these . systems are on different servers there is often a discrepancy in the . times on them (only a small slippage) and it is important that the force . is recording data accurately, but more crucially information is . provided for evidential purposes and this needs to be precise.’","Scotland Yard spent almost £17,000 speaking to talking clock last year alone .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:05 EST, 30 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:29 EST, 31 March 2012 . Shaquan Duley, 30, has been jailed for 35 years for the murder of her two toddlers . An unemployed and mentally ill South Carolina mother has been sentenced to 35 years in prison for killing her two young sons, then putting them in her car and staging a crash into a river. Shaquan Duley, 30, said nothing during the hearing except a very quiet 'yes sir' as Circuit Court Judge Edgar Dickson asked her questions. Dickson said he appreciated Duley taking responsibility but she needed to be punished for what she did. 'The sentence I hand down today does not reflect in any way this court minimizing the horror of what you did to your children, your family and this community,' Dickson said. Duley faced 30 years to life in prison after pleading guilty earlier this month to two counts of murder in the deaths of her sons, 2-year-old Devean and 18-month-old Ja'van in August 2010. The mother made no deal with prosecutors. After pleading guilty, Duley tearfully apologized for what she did. She also said she was happy that God let her keep her memories of her sons. 'In spite of whatever I've gone through,' Duley said. 'I still have hope and joy in my heart that one day I will see them again.' The case brought back heartrending reminders of Susan Smith, who rolled her car into a lake in Union County with her 3-year-old and 14-month-old sons in the back seat in Union in 1994. Tragic: Devan (left) was two and his brother Je'Van was 18 months when their mother suffocated them with her hands . But the cases differed in big ways. Prosecutors said Smith's sons were alive when her car went into the . lake, and she killed her boys because a man with whom she had an affair . broke off their relationship. Prosecutors . said Duley suffocated her sons with her hands in a motel room before . strapping them into their car seats and driving to the river 10 miles . away. She killed them because she was depressed over failing online classes and not having a job. She . also was upset the father of the boys didn't have anything to do with . them and just had a fight where her mother said she was a bad parent, . investigators said. Duley first told police she fell asleep before running off a bridge over the North Edisto River. Culpable: The prosecutor at her plea hearing earlier this month, pictured, said she accepted responsibility for what she did as she broke down in tears . Horror: Police said she snuffed out her sons' lives by putting her hand over their mouths, then placed the bodies in a car that she pushed over an embankment into the Edisto River (pictured) But . there were no skid marks or damage to the bridge. Instead, . investigators think she drove to a boat ramp and got out of her car . before letting it roll into the river. Duley's attorney said she intended to stay in the car and kill herself. She . also tried to commit suicide a couple of other times by taking an . overdose of headache medicine and trying to cut her wrist with a box . cutter after killing her sons. Police at the time said she confessed after initially lying about the deaths and trying to make them look accidental. 'She . was a mother that was unemployed. She had no means of taking care of . her children,' then-Sheriff Larry Williams said in 2010. A state-appointed forensic . psychiatrist found last summer that Duley suffered from mental illness . but that she knew right from wrong and knew what she was doing when she . killed her children, Pascoe said. The father of Duley's children was never located, the Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office said.","Shaquan Duley, 30, pleaded guilty to suffocating her two sons, aged two and 18 months and dumping them in a river ."

EU ‘propaganda’ is being handed out to teachers to indoctrinate pupils at a young age, it has emerged. A Brussels official responsible for providing classroom material to UK schools admitted a desire to teach youngsters about the ‘values of EU membership’ from a young age, before they are ‘misinformed’. The revelation that aggressively pro-European leaflets were being handed out at an education fair to ‘brainwash’ pupils has been heavily criticised. UKIP deputy leader and education spokesman Paul Nuttall MEP told the Express: ‘It is what we always suspected but could never prove. Now we can. They [the EU] are effectively using our cash to brainwash our children. And it has to stop.’ A video has emerged of Judith Schilling, the European Commission’s publication manager, handing out EU-focused leaflets at the Education Show in Birmingham. She tells an interviewer: 'Everybody has now picked up on the idea that we will never . succeed to convince people about the value of being a member of the . European Union if we do not start early enough with the young people . before they form prejudices and are misinformed by other sources.' Mr . Nuttall said he has written to Education Secretary Michael Gove and . Schools Minister Nick Gibb saying the teaching programme appears to . breach the law banning promotion of ‘partisan political views’ in . schools. Pupils must be given a balanced presentation of issues, he said. Mr . Nuttall has also called for the European Commission to be made to halt . its schools programme pending an inquiry and to order schools to stop . using such aids. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'It is . vital that such an important issue, which is essentially the deliberate . political indoctrination of our children, be dealt with in as open and . as transparent a way as possible.' It . comes after the EU was accused of trying to 'brainwash' children after . pupils all over the country were given pencil cases with its logo . emblazoned across it. The EU Commission (pictured) has produced a lesson plan using aggressively pro-European leaflets . The brightly-coloured pencil cases featuring the EU's 12-star logo were handed out to schoolchildren following an event encouraging teachers to forge links with the Commission. The one-day conference was staged by Staffordshire County Council and was attended by 50 teachers to raise awareness of the EU in schools, it was reported. On the Commission London HQ website, . visitors can click 'to enjoy our little movie' about its free . educational publications. The video shows Ms Schilling speaking about . the various teaching tools being provided by the Commission. Propaganda? A European Commission official said it needs to 'start early' to convince children of the merits of the EU . The free material includes the ‘Passport to the EU’, containing ‘fun’ information about the 27 member states. 'I've been told by many teachers that they love it and the children love it,’ says Ms Schilling. There is also a ‘mini language guide’ with samples of the EU’s 23 official languages, which she said was useful for primary schools. For 'slightly older' readers is 'The EU: What’s in it for me?' explaining 'how we benefit from membership of the EU in our daily life, everything between lower roaming charges and cleaner bathing water'. Both booklets are still available in British schools, the Express found.Mark English, a spokesman for the EU Commission in the UK, told the Express: 'The Commission distributes information to teachers and schools only when invited. Some material refers to benefits that the EU brings and gives evidence for this. Others have different views and schools are free to invite them, too. 'The Commission does not seek to mislead and invites those who systematically promote an anti-EU agenda through the media also to make their arguments based on the facts.' Tory MEP Emma McClarkin said: 'This looks like a licence to force-feed pupils a very one-sided, starry-eyed version of what the EU is and does for its people.

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 04:00 EST, 18 January 2012 . A cage fighter who scooped a £1million Lotto prize is planning on buying a £150,000 Lamborghini - after nearly throwing out his winning ticket. Gavin Davies, 29, only discovered he had won the Euromillions raffle 17 days after the draw was made. The father-of-one had left the ticket in his car's glove box but discovered he was a winner when he checked it on Friday 13. Winner: Cage fighter Gavin Davies has vowed to buy a Lamborghini Spyder similar to this one which Camelot lent him for the day after scooping £1million . He has vowed to act sensibly with his prize money - but has promised himself a Lamborghini Spyder LP560-4 capable of doing 201mph which will cost him in the region of £150,000. Lottery operators Camelot borrowed one for the day so the martial arts expert could try it out for size. Gavin, from Neath, South Wales, said: 'It's incredible - I've always wanted a Lamborghini and now I'm going to be purring around in one. 'I'm going to be the most popular man in town!' The former forklift truck driver added that the winning ticket could easily have been thrown out by mistake. 'With my partner being a cleaning freak it could have ended up in the bin without being claimed if she'd cleaned my car,' he said. It was thanks to an appeal in his local paper for a mystery missing millionaire to come forward that he began searching for what proved to be the winning ticket. Gavin, who has had two professional cagefights, bought the ticket from a shop near his home on December 27 and left it in his Audi. Double joy: Gavin Davies also celebrated his 22-year-old partner giving birth to their first child last month . He said: 'I've always said I'm going to be a millionaire one day - I spend about £25 every week on tickets. 'I've won small amounts a few times but because my partner is always cleaning up around the house they've gone unclaimed. 'This one was in the car and she'd been driving it around for a week - I'm lucky she didn't clean it out.' Gavin became a father for the first time last month with his 22-year-old partner. He added: 'Becoming a millionaire at any time is great but being 29 and having my first child it could not have come at a better time.' He survived a near fatal motorbike crash in 2006 when he broke both his legs and was told he would never walk again. But he proved them wrong and used his martial arts training to become a professional cage fighter - making a victorious debut in 2009. However, the 29-year-old broke his shoulder in his second fight and was still injured when he won the lottery prize. He said: 'I will continue to train but now I'm a millionaire with a baby I'm through with fighting professionally. 'I've hardly slept since I realised I'd won - I've just been lying in bed thinking how lucky I am. 'The Lamborghini is my one big purchase - I'm going to invest the rest and turn into £10m.' A National Lottery spokesman said: 'We're delighted that Gavin has now come forward and we hope that he will enjoy the win - it's certainly a great way to start 2012. 'It would have been awful if the ticket-holder had missed out on this substantial and life-changing amount of money. 'We would like to remind all National Lottery players to check their tickets every time they play.' Despite winning £1million Gavin will not be able to afford Lamborghini's most expensive supercar. The Italian Sesto Elemento costs around £1.9million.","Ticket left in the glove box of Audi for 17 days before it was checked .

D'Aloisio's app, Summly, came to the attention of technology investor Li Ka-Shing, the world's eleventh richest man, and the schoolboy has delayed his mock GCSEs to fly to California to meet investors. 'I was a bit worried about how people would react to my age, but luckily age doesn’t really come into it here,' said D'Aloisio. Nick D'Aloisio who has developed an iPhone App 'Summly' which has been picked as an App of the Week by Apple and downloaded 115,000 times . 'We’ve had amazing support in the Valley, and people have been really helpful.' The app has already been downloaded more than 115,000 times since launching several weeks ago, and was chosen by Apple as its app of the week. Called Summly, the free app can condense long web pages into text bullet points that can be easily read, 'boiling down' longer pieces by relevance. The app came to the attention . of renowned investor Li Ka-shing, who . backed the idea, and this week Nick was in Silicon Valley meeting . investors and potential customers. 'Getting Apple’s backing has been amazing. Six months ago when I was fine tuning the idea I knew it had potential, but the speed with which things have taken off has surprised me.' He has had to ask his teachers at King’s College School in Wimbledon to delay his mock GCSEs so that he could visit investors. D'Aloisio hopes he can sell the app and become a millionaire.

"By . Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 03:42 EST, 11 January 2012 . Life expectancy is written into our DNA and is there to be seen from the day we are born. It all depends on the length of the telomeres, which protect chromosomes from wear and tear . Scientists have found a way to predict how long someone will live – by measuring their genes as a baby. Life expectancy is written into our DNA and is there to be seen from the day we are born. It all depends on the length of the telomeres, which are described as 'acting like the plastic ends on shoelaces' to protect chromosomes from wear and tear. Telomeres are being studied extensively - and are thought to hold the key to ageing. Put simply, the longer your telomeres, the longer you will live  - dependent, of course, on not dying accidentally, from disease or from lifestyle factors. It was known they could be shortened by life choices, including  smoking and stress. But this is the first indication that our lifespans might be predetermined from birth. In the future, tests may allow people to know their expected lifespan from a very early age - if they want to. Professor Pat Monaghan, who led the Glasgow University study, said: ‘The results of this research show that what happens in our bodies in early life is very important. ‘It is not understood why there are variations of telomere length but if you had a choice, you would want to be born with longer telomeres. ‘If you were to test this, I don’t think anyone would want to know – it would just make you miserable. But it must be remembered that how you live has a big effect. This isn’t quite a case of nature overtaking nurture.’ The study – which used zebra finches, one of Australia’s most common bird species – is the first to  measure telomere lengths at regular intervals through an entire life. With people, it is usually only the elderly who are studied because of the timescales involved. Blood cell samples were taken from 99 finches, starting when they were 25 days old. The results exceeded even the researchers’ expectations. The birds with the shortest telomeres did tend to die first – from as early as seven months after the start of the trial. But one bird in the group with the longest telomeres survived to almost nine years old. Professor Monaghan said: ‘These birds were dying of natural causes. There were no predators, no diseases and no accidental deaths. This was showing their capacity for long life.’ The results hold huge implications for humans, whose telomeres work in the same way. In future, people might be tested to see how long their telomeres – and their life expectancy – could be. Telomeres are important because they stop DNA from unravelling – but they begin shortening from the moment we are conceived. The longer they are, the better for an individual because when they get too short, they stop working. DNA is then no longer protected and errors begin to creep in when cells divide. When this happens – usually in middle age – the skin begins to sag and the immune  system becomes less efficient. Faulty cells also lead to a growing risk of conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. The university’s institute of biodiversity, animal health and comparative medicine has published its groundbreaking research in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. In the next stage of their research, the Glasgow scientists will look at what causes telomeres to shorten – including inherited and environmental factors – to make it possible  to predict life expectancy more accurately.","'Telomere' markers predict lifespan .

Police in Hong Kong are hunting for an emerald and diamond ring worth over £1million which was stolen after its socialite owner left it in a hotel bathroom. Swiss jeweller Caroline Gruosi-Scheufele, 49, forgot she had taken the ring off to wash her hands after visiting the ladies' room of the Four Seasons Hotel's Harbour View ballroom in Hong Kong. She raced back seven minutes later only to discover it had gone. The stunning piece made by Chopard, the family firm which Mrs Gruosi-Scheufele runs with her brother Karl, consists of a 16.83 carat emerald sitting between two diamonds of 1.15 and 1.29 carats, with another 674 small diamonds around the band. Hong Kong police are treating the matter as theft and a £40,000 reward has been offered for its return. It is not yet clear whether the reward money has been offered by the police or the jewellers themselves. A police spokesman said: 'A female . foreigner left an emerald ring valued at HK$12 million in the washroom . on the fourth floor of the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong. 'She took off the ring to wash her hands and forgot about it when she left the washroom. 'When she remembered the ring a few minutes later, she went back but failed to find it.' The ring's owner Caroline Gruosi-Scheufele, . claims she raced back to the bathroom seven minutes later but the ring similar to this had . gone . Mrs Gruosi-Scheufele, who has appeared in the pages of Hello magazine, claims she last saw the ring at around 11.24pm but by 11.31pm it had gone. She was in Hong Kong for the opening of a new Chopard store when the theft happened on Sept 8 last year. Detectives declined to say if staff and guests had been searched. Their spokesman added: 'A lot of people were coming and going. The washroom was very busy.' It is feared the ring could already have been disassembled and sold off through Hong Kong's network of small jewellers and pawn shops. Originally a watchmaker, Chopard, recently signed the Hollywood star . Uma Thurman to wear its products. The company was founded in 1860 by . Louis-Ulysse Chopard. Venue: The ring was left in the bathroom of the Harbour View Ballroom at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong . It was bought by Mrs Gruosi-Scheufele's  parents, . Karl and Karin Scheufele, in 1963. Last . week a 16-carat yellow diamond, stolen in an armed raid on a London . jewellers more than four years ago, surfaced in a Hong Kong pawn shop. The owner of the Yau On pawn shop is refusing to return the item claiming they paid more than HK$3 million (£252,000) for it in November 2010. The London jewellers Graff are now suing for the diamond’s immediate return at Manhattan’s state supreme court in New York.","Police hunt for missing 16 carat emerald and diamond gem .

"By . Michael Seamark . UPDATED: . 20:59 EST, 2 March 2012 . Riding Raisa: With apologies to the PM, the Mail has used computer technology to imagine who he might have looked riding Rebekah Brook's horse . Finally, from the horse’s mouth no less, the truth emerged yesterday about David Cameron and the ageing police horse loaned to Rebekah Brooks. For days Downing Street had prevaricated over whether the Prime Minister had ever ridden the animal which has come to symbolise the dubious links between the Metropolitan Police and Rupert Murdoch’s News International. Now Mr Cameron has confessed that the horse, named Raisa, was among those he rode while out with Mrs Brooks’s husband Charlie. The admission came four days after it . emerged that Mrs Brooks, the former Sun and News of the World editor . arrested by police investigating phone-hacking and bribery, had been . lent the 24-year-old retired Met horse between 2008 and 2010. The Prime Minister’s official . spokesman tried to laugh off the affair – inevitably dubbed ‘Horsegate’ – . on Wednesday, saying: ‘The only horses I am interested in are the type . you can put a bet on. He has never been in a race in which I can back a . horse.’ The following day Mr Cameron, a close . friend and neighbour of the former newspaper executive and a fellow . member of Oxfordshire’s so-called Chipping Norton Set, confirmed he had . gone riding not with her but with her husband, a former racehorse . trainer. Mr Cameron also insisted he had not . ridden the police horse, which has since died, since becoming Prime . Minister but senior Tory sources indicated it was ‘possible, probable . even’ that he had before coming to power. Admission: David Cameron, pictured at a party with Mrs Brooks in 2009, could now be embroiled in the controversy surrounding the Met Police lending a horse to the ex-News of the World editor . At a press conference in Brussels . yesterday Mr Cameron apologised for allowing a ‘confusing picture’ to . emerge. He told reporters that Raisa was among his mounts when he rode . with Mr Brooks, a friend since they attended Eton. ‘I have not been riding with him since the election,’ said Mr Cameron. ‘Before the election, yes, I did go riding with him. Mrs Brooks's sprawling Chipping Norton home in the Cotswolds is not far from David Cameron's. Outbuildings or what appear to be stables are pictured in the foreground . WEDNESDAY ‘The only horses I am interested in are the type you can put a bet on. He has never been in a race in which I can back a horse.’ PM’s official spokesman tries to laugh off the affair . THURSDAY ‘It’s a matter of record that I have been riding with Rebekah Brooks’s husband, Charlie Brooks. He is a friend of mine of 30 years’ standing and a neighbour in my constituency so that’s a matter of record, but since I have been Prime Minister I think I have been on a horse once and it wasn’t that one.’ David Cameron . ‘We don’t know if he has been on Raisa. Charlie has a lot of horses. It’s possible, probable even, that he has been on that one.’ Tory source . FRIDAY ‘I can categorically state that he never rode that horse. I do actually live there. It’s all rubbish.’ Jeremy Clarkson, News International columnist . ‘I have not been riding with him (Charlie Brooks) since the election. Before the election, yes, I did go riding with him. He has a number of horses and, yes, one of them was this former police horse Raisa which I did ride. I am very sorry to hear that Raisa is no longer with us and I think I should probably conclude by saying I don’t think I will be getting back into the saddle any time soon.’David Cameron . ‘He has a number of horses and, yes, one of them was this former police horse Raisa which I did ride. ‘I am very sorry to hear that Raisa . is  no longer with us and I think I should  probably conclude by saying I . don’t think I will be getting back into the saddle any time soon.’ Horsegate has revived speculation . about the Prime Minister’s closeness to Mrs Brooks, who quit as chief . executive of News International at the height of the phone-hacking . scandal last year. Tory sources insist Mr Cameron has ‘no . recollection’ of riding with Mrs Brooks but according to former News of . the World feature writer Paul McMullan, the politician and the . newspaper executive regularly went riding together. He claims he was sent to ‘doorstep my ex-boss by hiding in the bushes, waiting for her to come past with Cameron on a horse’. Mr Cameron attended the Brookses’ wedding in 2009 and the  ex-racehorse trainer is chairman of the . Heythrop Hunt in Oxfordshire, which Mr Cameron has ridden with. According to Vanity Fair magazine, Mr Cameron was so close to Mrs Brooks that he signed his  letters to her ‘love, David’. News that she had been lent the horse . the year after two people were jailed for phone hacking at her former . paper, the News of the World, caused astonishment and a storm of Twitter . jokes. The deal was struck after Mrs Brooks, . currently on bail after being arrested last July, approached Dick . Fedorcio – the Met’s head of public affairs.  He is currently on . gardening leave pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct. Two police horses on patrol in Manchester. The Met has 120 horses in its Mounted Section which are used for public order events including football matches and demonstrations . Most of the Met's police horses are retired with The Horse Trust charity in Speen, Buckinghamshire, pictured . Most retired Met horses are put out to . grass at a horse charity in Buckinghamshire but some are loaned out to . members of the public for a limited period. Raisa was transported in 2008 to the . Brookses’ sprawling Cotswolds home and the then editor of the Sun became . ‘foster-carer’ for the animal. But news of the horse ‘loan’ led to . tensions between the Yard and Mrs Brooks when the Met, in a detailed . statement released explaining the arrangement, accused her of handing . back Raisa in a ‘poor but not serious’ condition. Mr Brooks retorted by . insisting the animal had been impeccably treated.' Racing fan: Mrs Brooks, right, is pictured with Rupert Murdoch's son-in-law Matthew Freud, left, at the Cheltenham Festival . He declared: ‘I have been around and . looked after horses all my  life and I am confident that I  know more . about caring for  them than people at the Metropolitan Police.’ And Mr Murdoch also rode to the rescue . of his one-time protégée, tweeting: ‘Now they are complaining about R . Brooks saving an old horse from the  glue factory!’ To add to the confusion, Top Gear . presenter Jeremy Clarkson – another member of the Chipping Norton Set . and a columnist for the News International titles the Sun and Sunday . Times – claimed that Mr Cameron had never ridden the horse in question. Defence: Rupert Murdoch stood by former News International boss Brooks following the news she was loaned a horse . Before Mr Cameron’s admission, he told . Chris Evans on BBC Radio 2: ‘I can categorically state that he never . rode that horse. I do actually live there. It’s all rubbish.’ According to Raisa’s entry on the . National Equine database, she was a bay, born on January 1, 1986. Technically, the Yard has broken the database’s rules by failing to . inform officials that the horse died in 2010. At the Scottish Labour Conference in . Dundee, Ed Miliband  said: ‘Today we learn that Cameron cannot even . manage to be straight about riding a horse loaned to him by a News . International executive. ‘The horse story may seem ridiculous. It is. But it is also becoming the symbol of how leading politicians got . too close to powerful media players.’ His deputy leader Harriet Harman said: . ‘People will be dismayed that while News International was busy hacking . phones, David Cameron was out hacking with Rebekah Brooks’s husband. ‘David Cameron has not been straight . about just how close he was to senior executives at News International . and it’s time for him come clean about the extent of this relationship .

He joined 581 volunteers who turned out to search for the 15-year-old who disappeared more than two weeks ago in Morgan Hill, California. Sierra was reported missing by her . mother on March 16, having never made it to the bus or her Morgan, Hill . California high school. High-profile: 49ers quarterback Alex Smith joined the hunt for missing California girl Sierra LaMar on Saturday . Police ruled the disappearance . as a kidnapping as Sierra does not having a history as a runaway or any . unusually negative family problems. Interviews with friends and a search . of her computer also yielded no information indicating she fled. On Thursday an empty 'handcuff' box and two used condoms were found by a search volunteer within 1.5miles of where the pretty teen's Samsung cellphone and Juicy-brand handbag were found. Investigators told Mercury News that the find could be a major breakthrough in the disappearance which has stumped police for two weeks, or it could be a simple coincidence. The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office has sent the cardboard box and condoms for forensics tests. 'Other than the fact that it's pretty close to Sierra's mom's house, there's no indication at this time that it's related,' Sgt. Jose Cardoza told Mercury News. 'But we're collecting it as possible evidence.' 'This may be another significant piece of evidence, but it's hard to confirm that it's related at this time,' he added.

"By . Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 07:47 EST, 12 January 2012 . Most scientists believe that human beings evolved in Africa, then migrated from the continent to conquer the world. But researchers from the University of Tubingen in Germany believe that our ancestry might be more complicated - and significant parts of human evolution might have happened in Europe and Western Asia. The new theory comes after the discovery of an ape's tooth in Bulgaria - dating two million years after the 'pre-humans' were thought to have died out in Europe. The seven-million-year-old tooth shows that the pre-human had evolved to eat a European diet of grasses, seeds and nuts, rather than fruit. The Bulgarian pre-human molar revealed that the ape had eaten hard, abrasive objects such as grasses, seeds and nuts. This suggested that it adapted to a change in its surroundings in order to survive . The discovery of the seven million year old tooth has caused scientists to question previous theories about when our simian ancestors disappeared. It suggests a 'significant' part of human evolution happened in Europe. Prior to the discovery, the 'youngest' hominid remains found in Europe was a 9.2 million year old fossil unearthed in Greece, which led scientists to conclude that the apes had died out nine million years ago. This was backed up by climate data showing European had changed from lush green forests to arid savannahs, causing a severe drop in the levels of fruit that formed the bulk of the great apes' diet. Professor Madelaine Bohme and geologist Philipe Havlik at the archeological site in a sand quarry in Bulgaria. The seven-million-year-old tooth could rewrite our understanding of human evolution . However, a closer look at the Bulgarian pre-human hominid molar revealed that the ape had eaten hard, abrasive objects such as grasses, seeds and nuts. This suggested that it adapted to a change in its surroundings in order to survive. Researchers from the University of Tubingen in Germany said the ape's diet was similar to that of African hominids, which only disappeared four million years ago. Study author Professor Madelaine Bohme, whose findings were published in the Journal of Human Evolution said: 'We now also need to rethink where the origin of humans took place. 'So far, most scientists believe that human evolution happened exclusively in Africa and that humans migrated from Africa to other continents. 'There is increasing evidence, however, that a significant part of human evolution happened outside Africa, in Europe and western Asia.' The seven-million-year-old pre-human tooth was found in a sand quarry in Azmaka in Bulgaria . She added: 'Until now, the most recent fossil was that of a 9.2 million year old specimen of Ouranopithecus macedonensis from Greece. 'Hominids therefore were thought to have disappeared from Europe prior to 9 million years ago. 'At this time, European terrestrial ecosystems had been changed from mostly evergreen and lush forests to savannah-like landscapes with a seasonal climate.' 'It had been thought that great apes, which typically consume fruits, were unable to survive this change due to a seasonal deficiency of fruits.' 'We found animals typical of a savannah in the fossil-bearing layer: several species of elephants, giraffes, gazelles, antelopes, rhinos, and sabre-toothed cats. 'This discovery suggests that European hominids were able to adapt to the seasonal climate of a savannah-like ecosystem.' 'This conclusion is further corroborated by electron microscope analysis of the tooth's masticatory surface, which reveals that the Bulgarian hominid had consumed hard and abrasive objects like grass, seeds, and nuts. 'In this respect, the feeding behavior of this animal resembles that of later African hominids from about 4 million years ago, such as australopithecids like 'Lucy'","Seven-million-year-old tooth from 'pre-human hominid'

Gary McKinnon's supporters meet at 10 Downing Street today to mark a'nightmare' decade since his arrest for computer hacking. His family have been battling against extradition after the Asperger's sufferer hacked into NASA and Pentagon computers looking for evidence of aliens. The Americans are demanding Gary be extradited despite medical experts warning he could kill himself if sent to the U.S. His mother Janis Sharp said last night:'Ten years have gone by and still Gary lives in a nightmare world - unable to control the terror that consumes his every waking moment. 'This endless pressure on an Aspergic man with severe mental health issues is barbaric. And for what? 'A foolish act that has caused embarrassment to the US. 'Where has our sense of proportion gone?' Mrs Sharp will be handing in poems at Downing Street received after Gary's supporters set up the Poetic Justice Campaign marking his ten years of'fear and torment.' Mrs Sharp, who will be joined by long-time supporter Trudie Styler, Gary's MP David Burrowes, former Tory shadow Home Secretary David Davis and Lord Maginnis said: 'In March David Cameron is visiting President Obama to discuss our “ special relationship”. What an opportunity for our PM to finally announce an end to Gary's ordeal. 'This act alone would prove that the “special relationship” has true meaning and is one of mutual respect.' Bob Geldof is just one of many of Gary McKinnon's high-profile supporters . Last month the High Court ruled that Gary's legal nightmare must be decided by the summer . Home Secretary Theresa May agreed to delay his extradition in 2010 and is examining psychiatric evidence before she makes her final decision. Lord Justice Richards, sitting with Mr Justice Cranston, said this new medical report must be handed to the McKinnon legal team within 28 days. Gary's lawyers will have a similar period to respond before Mrs May decides his fate. The judges said they were fixing the hearing date for July 'to concentrate minds' and Edward Fitzgerald QC, appearing for Gary - whose 46th birthday is on Friday - said he hoped Mrs May would now block the extradition. Scores of celebrities and politicians from all parties have voiced their support for Gary since the Daily Mail launched its An Affront to British Justice campaign to stop his extradition in 2009. Rock stars Sir Bob Geldof, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, Sting, singers Chrissie Hynde and Peter Gabriel and actress Julie Christie all voiced their support to keep Gary in this country.","Gary McKinnon's family battling against his extradition after he hacked into Nasa and Pentagon .

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 04:32 EST, 3 January 2012 . This undated file picture shows a former member of Japan's Aum Supreme Truth doomsday cult Makoto Hirata, 46, who was arrested in Tokyo on January 1, 2012 after almost 17 years on the run . He was one of Japan's most wanted men - a former member of a doomsday cult that staged deadly gas attacks on the Tokyo subway in 1995. But it has emerged today that when Makoto Hirata turned himself in to authorities, after more than 16 years on the run, police didn't exactly rush to arrest him. Incredibly, the 46-year-old was turned away when he tried to surrender at Tokyo police headquarters on New Year's Eve. Hirata, a former Aum Shinri Kyo cult member, had been on the top of Japan's most wanted list since May 1995. Yet an officer at the main entrance of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police HQ thought it was just a prank. According to reports, he . approached the officer around 11.35pm Saturday and said: 'I am Makoto . Hirata. I am turning myself in.' But the officer dismissed him as a . fake and urged Hirata to go to a local police station some 700m away, said the Asahi Shimbun, the Yomiuri Shimbun and the . Mainichi Shimbun newspapers. Hirata, who is wanted over a 1995 kidnapping, then told to the officer: 'I am Hirata on the special wanted list.' The officer did not consult with his . colleagues and again told Hirata to head to the Marunouchi police . station, where he arrived 15 minutes later and was arrested, local media . said. Hirata's hair was longer than in . his photos from the mid-1990s, but his major facial features and body . shape had not significantly changed, the Asahi said. Victims: Commuters lie on the ground outside Tokyo's Tsukiji subway station after the sarin nerve gas attack . Hirata also claims to have called a . police hotline recently about his case, but was not taken seriously, . national broadcaster NHK said. He turned himself in after nearly . 17 years on the run for his alleged role in a plot to kidnap a man in . 1995 and conspiring with others to hold him in confinement and inject . him with a chemical, causing him to die. Hirata reportedly told . investigators that he wanted to turn himself in after seeing the . devastation caused by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Hirata (centre, with head bowed down), is escorted earlier today by police officers from a police station in Tokyo . Officers stand guard as the car containing Hirata is driven away towards another police station . He said he could come forward . because the statute of limitations had expired for a 1995 shooting of . the chief of the National Police Agency. Hirata reportedly told . investigators that he wanted to avoid a wrongful arrest and claims to . have no role in the shooting, despite earlier police suspicion that he . was involved. He told police he turned himself in because he wanted a sense of closure after being on the run for such a long time. He was one of three former Aum Shinri Kyo cult members still at large after a series of crimes by the group. The cult's founder, Shoko Asahara, whose real name is Chizuo Matsumoto, had his death sentence confirmed in 2006. Simultaneous attacks with sarin nerve gas on five Tokyo subway trains during rush hour on March 20, 1995, killed 12 people and made thousands ill. The attacks, with pictures of bodies lying across platforms and soldiers in gas masks sealing off subway stations, shattered the country's self-image as a haven of public safety.","Walked into police Tokyo's police HQ .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . UPDATED: . 15:41 EST, 18 January 2012 . David Cameron sparked an ageism row today after referring to a veteran Labour MP as 'a dinosaur'. Left-wing Dennis Skinner, dubbed 'the Beast of Bolsover' because of the Derbyshire constituency he represents, asked the final question during Mr Cameron's weekly 30-minute Commons grilling at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Skinner, who turns 80 next month, asked Mr Cameron when he would appear before Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry into press standards. David Cameron responds to a question from Labour MP Dennis Skinner, before calling him a 'dinosaur' and sparking an ageism row . Dennis Skinner, the 'Beast of Bolsover' asks David Cameron if he will be attending the Leveson Inquiry to answer questions on phone hacking . The PM said he would be 'delighted' to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice when required, then added: 'It's good to see the honourable gentleman on such good form. 'I often say to my children ''No need to go to the Natural History Museum to see a dinosaur, come to the House of Commons at about 12.30pm''.' Bolshy Mr Skinner (right) has been known as the Beast of Bolsover for decades for his outspoken comments and habit of infuriating successive Labour leaders. The 79-year-old loose cannon claims to come from 'good working-class mining stock' and has been hot water many a time for his unruly outbursts. A fiercely left-wing, old school Labourite, Mr Skinner has been thrown out of the Commons at least nine times - including being ejected in 1992 for calling then agriculture minister John Gummer a 'little squirt' and a 'wart'. In 1981 he was even 'named' - the next stage up in the Speakers' disciplinary weaponry - and banned from the chamber for five days. When complaining in 2005 about the state of the 1980s economy under Tory governments, Mr Skinner said of George Osborne, then shadow chancellor: 'The only thing that was growing then were the lines of coke in front of boy George and the rest of the Tories.' The barb later sparked a point of order from Labour MP Paul Flynn (Newport West), who asked if it was appropriate for MPs to be criticised on the basis of their age. Raising his point of order, Mr Flynn said: 'One of the areas of Parliamentary life that has improved in recent years is it is now completely unacceptable for one Member to criticise another Member on the basis of gender, on the basis of race, ethnicity or disability. 'The most under-represented group in this Parliament are the septuagenarians. Today we heard what I believe many of us (believed) was a gratuitous and entirely offensive insult to a greatly respected honourable Member made entirely because of his age. 'Is it right that ageist discriminatory remarks should be outlawed the same as the other discriminatory remarks are?' Labour MP Brian Donohoe (Central Ayrshire) added: 'Is it not also the case Erskine May makes it very clear that no Member of Parliament should criticise another one and call them a name that relates to an animal? In these circumstances is it not only right that the Prime Minister should come back to this place and apologise to Dennis Skinner?' And Labour's David Winnick (Walsall North) then raised a further point of order: 'Those of us of a certain age group should not be seen as the new persecuted minority.' But on the same point of order, Tory Mark Pritchard (The Wrekin) said: 'I wonder whether this House of Commons would be better with more or less humour?' 'Entirely offensive insult': Mr Cameron's comments sparked a point of order from Labour MP Paul Flynn . Replying to the four points of order, Speaker John Bercow said: 'I'm always in favour of humour but just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, humour is a matter of subjective judgment. 'Sometimes people are funny. Sometimes they think they are funny. Sometimes they think they are funny deliberately when they are not. Sometimes they don't realise they are funny when they are. 'There are all sorts of different permutations. I think it would be unwise for me to offer a view as to the category of which the matter of current discussion happens to fall. 'Coming back to the point of Mr Winnick, I agree septuagenarians should not become a persecuted minority. You are sometimes in a principled minority on a range of matters and has been throughout your parliamentary career. All I would say is I don't think you are persecuted, certainly not by me, and I think anyone trying to persecute you should frankly give up the unequal struggle. 'As to the point of order from Mr Donohoe, I think I am right in saying that Erskine May no longer contains the prohibition to which you refer. At one time or another there has been a prohibition on or presumption against reference to an existing animal.' 'As far as Mr Flynn is concerned, I think I would say it is very difficult for me to interpret the mindset of another Member, be that a newly arrived Member, or a very senior Member or the most senior Member of the Government. 'Sometimes I think an observation might be made with reference to a past attitude, style or conduct and I don't think I want to get into the issue of what was said today - though I might want to reflect on it. 'All I would say is I share your absolute disapproval of sexism, ageism, racism and other forms of discrimination.'","PM: 'I tell my children ''No need to go to the Natural History Museum to see a dinosaur, come to the House of Commons at about 12.30pm''.'

Moving on: Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly (above) is leaving the BBC to set up a charity helping women facing discrimination at work . Miriam O’Reilly is to leave the BBC to launch a support service for women facing discrimination in the workplace, a year after her own ageism tribunal victory against the Corporation. The former Countryfile presenter, who is thought to have received a six-figure payout following last January’s verdict, is also planning to take on other broadcasting work. She is only one year into the three-year-deal she was offered to return to the BBC in the wake of her victory, which has seen her co-host daytime show Crimewatch Roadshow. Miss O’Reilly, 54, was one of four women presenters in their 40s and 50s who were removed from BBC1 rural affairs show Countryfile in 2009, when the show was being revamped for peak time. In last year’s landmark ruling the BBC was accused of being obsessed with attracting younger viewers and of ‘social engineering’ for sacking her because she was seen as too old. Yesterday Miss O’Reilly said: ‘I have had a rewarding time at the BBC over the last year but am now choosing to move on and work on other projects for a while including my charity, Women’s Equality Network.’ Removed: Miss O'Reilly on Countryfile. She was dismissed by the BBC because she was seen to be too old, but won a landmark court ruling which accused the Corporation of 'social engineering' The presenter has set up the charity with the lawyer who helped her win her case, Camilla Palmer. Its website will launch next month. Miss O’Reilly added: ‘We realised from the amount of emails and letters Camilla and I were getting how many women didn’t know where to go for help and advice about all kinds of discrimination – sexism, racism, ageism. It really did surprise us.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘We would like to thank Miriam for her work on BBC television and radio and we wish her well in her new challenges but hope there will be opportunities to work together again in the future.’","Presenter unfairly dismissed from Countryfile show .

"By . Tammy Hughes . UPDATED: . 08:22 EST, 15 December 2011 . A young mother died from liver failure following routine surgery after she took 'a few extra tablets' of paracetamol each day to cope with the pain. Desiree Phillips, 20, had a number of benign lumps on her breast removed earlier this year. Doctors prescribed antibiotics and over-the-counter paracetamol to help her cope with the discomfort. Accidental overdose: Desiree Phillips died after taking extra paracetamol tablets to help her cope with pain following surgery to remove a benign breast lump . Her family suspected she was taking just ‘a few extra tablets’ a day before she was admitted to hospital with a failing liver nine days after the operation. The single mother, from Llanelli, South Wales, endured a week of excruciating pain and a liver transplant. But she died at Birmingham Queen Elizabeth hospital on August 26. Her grandfather Des Phillips and mother Ayshea spoke of their shock and sorrow. Mr Phillips, 58, a chef, said: ‘She must have been taking a few extra tablets than the recommended eight a day. She seemed fine to us, then out of the blue her boyfriend found her stretched out on the sofa. ‘When we heard she was at hospital we never expected she might die. People don’t realise that an extra two over a period of time can harm your liver if you keep taking that over two to three weeks.’ He added:'We have lost part of our heart, losing her like this.' Warning: Doctors have told people to beware of a staggered overdose of paracetamol, which is where they take an extra couple of tablets each day over a longer period . By the time Desiree arrived at hospital, her liver failure was irreversible. Liver failure can result in a potentially fatal build-up of fluid in the brain. Mr Phillips said: ‘They said she should have a liver transplant straight away but her body rejected the new organ.’ Although an inquest is yet to be held, Desiree’s family is keen for action to be taken to try to prevent similar tragedies. Mr Phillips said: ‘If a painkiller is that dangerous, it should be prescribed. Cigarettes have a label saying “smoking kills” but paracetamol packets don’t look dangerous.’ Desiree’s family said her one-year-old son Jayden is now being cared for by his father Simon Dewi-Jones. Desiree’s mother Ayshea, 38, added: ‘Jayden doesn’t deserve to be growing up without a mum because of this.’ The 20-year-old's funeral was held at Llanelli Crematorium yesterday. Dr Kenneth Simpson, of the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit, who led a study on paracetamol-induced liver injury in 663 patients, says 161 of them had taken a ‘staggered overdose’ – taking one or two too many over several days. ‘Those who’ve taken a staggered overdose do worse, paradoxically, than the people who’ve tried to kill themselves,’ said Dr Simpson. A Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency spokesman said: ‘Paracetamol is a safe and effective painkiller when used correctly and when dosage recommendations are followed. ‘Every pack has a warning about overdose and instructions not to take more than eight tablets in any 24-hour period.’","One in four with paracetamol-induced liver damage have taken a 'staggered overdose'

An Airbus 380 lost its wing-tip in a taxiing collision with a building, just two months after another superjumbo was grounded for striking a private jet in New York. The A380 super-jumbo was grounded after the smash at slow-speed at the Le Bourget airport, where the Paris Air Show is taking place. The collision mirrored an incident at JFK airport earlier this year when a private jet was spun round after it was hit by the wing of an A380. A big problem: The damaged right-hand wingtip of Airbus A380 which collided with a taxi-way building in the latest embarrassing incident to hit the superjumbo . Here's a tip for you: The incident happened at the Paris Air Show - the main trade event for the European aviation industry . Repair: An engineer gets to work on the damaged A380 wing . The aircraft had been scheduled for . demonstration flights during the show but these have now been cancelled, . show spokesman Alexander Reinhardt said Monday. The incident was another embarrassment for the European planemaker at the launch of the aviation industry's premier showcase. The Airbus A400M military transport plane also had to cancel a demonstration flight because of what the manufacturer described as a minor gearbox problem, although the aircraft will still make a fly-over during President Nicolas Sarkozy's visit to the air show today, Reinhardt said. On Saturday, Airbus announced that two of the three versions of its new widebody jet, the A350, would be delayed about two years. Broken: A team of Airbus engineers realise that it'll take a bit more than Sellotape to mend the wing . On a wing and a prayer: Airbus Industry technicians work on the Airbus A380's damaged wing tip . Grounded: The gigantic plane, with a wing-span of 80 metres, sits on the tarmac next to the building it struck . Crash: The Air France moments before impacting the much smaller Comair CRJ business type jet . The stretched A350-1000 is being pushed back to 2017 to give engine supplier Rolls Royce time to develop a more powerful motor that will extend the jet's range, Airbus said. The standard version of the plane, the A350-900, is still expected to arrive in the second half of 2013, Airbus said. Cost: $375.3 million . Passengers: 525 people in three-class configuration or up to 853 people in all-economy class . Space: 5,146 square feet of floor space; 49% more than the current next-largest airliner, the Boeing 747-400 with 3,453 square feet . The Airbus A380 made its maiden flight on 27 April 2005 from Toulouse, France, and made its first commercial flight on 25 October 2007 from Singapore to Sydney with Singapore Airlines . The grounded flights and delays cast a shadow over Airbus as it takes on its traditional rival Boeing Co. at the air show, where both are expected to announce a string of orders as they vie for the position of biggest planemaker in the world. Qatar Airways announced an order for six Boeing 777 planes in a $1.7 billion deal at the start of the show Monday. Beyond the rivalry, the search for more environmentally friendly aircraft is shaping up as a major theme of this year's Paris Air Show, the world's largest and oldest aviation showcase. The aviation industry has suffered this year from skyrocketing fuel costs and bleak forecasts for the international air transport market. ...moments later the smaller jet is spun 90 degrees... The International Air Transport Association last month warned that natural disasters in Japan, unrest in the Middle East and rising fuel prices would cause airline industry profits to collapse only a year after they'd begun to recover from the global economic crisis. More than 2,100 exhibitors from 45 countries have signed up to take part in the weeklong event showcasing both commercial and defense aircraft. Airbus expects to bag bountiful orders for a new, more fuel-efficient version of its workhorse A320 shorthaul jet, while Boeing is spotlighting its new mid-range 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 intercontinental passenger jets.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:30 EST, 28 June 2011 . A woman found a DVD in her boyfriend's briefcase - and was stunned to watch a secret film of his female colleagues using their office toilet. Shocked Rachel Jones, 27, from Swansea, South Wales, then texted his workmates to warn them about the camera hidden in the toilets of the education offices. A court heard it was 'every woman's nightmare' when Ms Jones, a shopworker, discovered her live-in boyfriend, Matthew Hopkins, 29, was a secret Peeping Tom. Caught: Matthew Hopkins (right) admitted to filming his female colleagues in the toilet, after his girlfriend Rachel Jones (left) found footage on a DVD in his briefcase . But the court heard she wanted to protect the 14 women colleagues from Hopkins. She grabbed his phone to text the women: 'I have something distressing to tell you. He has been filming you at work. 'I am sorry to tell you this - he is disgusting.' Hopkins yesterday escaped with a three-year community order after being found guilty of filming 14 different women in the education department of Swansea council in South Wales. Prosecutor Natasha Morgan said: 'Hopkins purchased a covert camera from eBay and set it up in the toilets concealed behind a partition. 'The camera was sound activated and would start up when someone came into the room. 'His voyeurism was exposed by his ex-partner Rachel Jones after she found a disc in his bag, that disc had files showing various women using the toilet. 'Rachel identified one of the women as a work colleague she knew from his Facebook and decided to confront Hopkins. 'He admitted recording the women to her and said he would watch the tapes when she was out at work for sexual gratification. 'Rachel then sent a text to various contacts on Hopkins' phone telling them of what he had done. Swansea Crown Court heard the 14 different victims felt 'violated, shocked and distressed'. Administration officer Hopkins was confronted by women workers - but denied making the DVD and said his girlfriend was 'causing trouble.' CCTV footage at the council offices revealed Hopkins going into work at 6.30am the next day - and he is believed to have dismantled the camera. Ms Jones then searched their flat to find a second disc and recognised another of Hopkins' colleagues from the spy film. Miss Morgan said: 'Rachel sent the woman a message on Facebook and informed her of the disc. 'Rachel agreed to hand it over to the woman, who intended to hand it over to the Human Resources department at the council.' The court heard Hopkins was sacked and his bosses called in police. Ms Jones had been sharing a flat in Mount Pleasant, Swansea, with Hopkins but the pair have split - and he has moved back to his mother. Hopkins, now of Brecon, Powys, admitted 14 counts of voyeurism of 'recording other persons during a private act for the purpose of sexual gratification, knowing they did not consent.' Defending, Simon Howell said: 'He made a full and frank admission. 'The consequences are far-reaching; the inevitable loss of employment and future employment prospects are seriously hampered by this, as well as the serious social stigma attached to offences of this kind.' Hopkins was ordered to attend a sex offenders' rehabilitation programme and told to register as a sex offender for five years. He was put under a restraining order preventing him from contacting or approaching his 14 victims. Judge Keith Thomas said: 'This was a grossly offensive breach of their right to privacy by you for your sexual gratification. 'It was also a gross breach of trust to spy on people who you work with. 'They feel embarrassed and humiliated that their privacy has been violated by a Peeping Tom.' Judge Thomas said he had a choice to jail Hopkins or put him on a course to protect women from his deviant sexual behaviour. Ms Jones declined to comment after the case but a friend said: 'It was a terrible shock to find that the man you are living with is a secret pervert. 'She just couldn't let it carry on and had to tell his colleagues what he was doing. She is moving on and rebuilding her life.'",Matthew Hopkins ordered to attend sex offenders' rehabilitation programme and register as sex offender .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 06:20 EST, 19 August 2011 . 'Virtual' boarding agents are greeting passengers at a French airport in a bid to jazz up terminals with 21st century avatars who always smile, don't need breaks and never go on strike. The pilot project at Paris' Orly airport began last month, and has so far been met with a mix of amusement and surprise by travellers. So convincing are they that people frequently try to touch and speak with the life-like video images that greet them and direct them to their boarding gate. Convincing: A virtual boarding agent displaying a plane's destination welcomes passengers at Orly airport on the outskirts of Paris . The images materialise seemingly out of . thin air when a boarding agent - a real live human - presses a button to . signal the start of boarding. They are actually being rear-projected onto a human shaped silhouette made of plexiglass. Three real-life airport boarding agents were filmed in a studio to create the illusion, which the airport hopes will be more eye-catching and easier for passengers to understand than traditional electronic display terminals. 'Bonjour! I invite you to go to your boarding gate. Paris Airports wishes you a bon voyage,' the image appears to say, while the name of the destination flashes in front of him. Airport authority AdP came up with the idea for what it calls '2-D holograms' earlier this year. It was brainstorming ways to modernise Hall 40, one of the dozens of boarding gates at Paris' second airport, south of the capital. Didier Leroy, the airport's director of operations, said: 'Children like it, it's fun. They're attracted to it and try to play with it. 'There's finally very few who find it useless or just a gizmo.' Pilot project: A boy travelling through Orly airport is bemused by the talking hologram . The technology behind the images was developed by a Paris audiovisual marketing agency, L'Oeil du Chat. Similar virtual agents are in place in airports in London and Manchester since earlier this year. Hall 40 serves about 30 or 40 flights a day, Leroy said. Around one million passengers a year pass through it, mainly on their way to destinations in the south of France and Corsica. The airport decided to make it a 'laboratory' for testing new ways of organising its boarding gates. It received an overhaul this spring that created 40 percent more space and 20 percent more seats so that it can now hold up to 400 waiting passengers. As passengers boarded a flight to Bastia in Corsica, one small boy of about five years old approached the hologram, this one showing a middle-aged man in a striped shirt and neatly trimmed beard. ""Hello!"" the boy greeted it. The pre-recorded image smiled, blinked, folded his hands, glanced to the left but said nothing. Leroy said the airport's experiment with virtual reality will be evaluated by the end of the year, after which it could be expanded to other boarding halls at Orly or to Paris' larger Charles de Gaulle airport. Not all passengers were as taken with the virtual hosts as the boy. ""It spooks me the way his eyes seem to follow you,"" said Cedric Olivier, 32, an Air France pilot waiting for his flight. Other passengers hurried past with barely a glance at the hologram, more concerned about boarding the plane and finding space for their carry-ons.","The pilot project at Paris' Orly airport began last month .

Hulme had a legitimate claim in May 1996 for back pain, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard. But she failed to notify authorities of a change in circumstances between 2009 and 2010. Judge Mark Eades told Hulme that her life and reputation had been 'publicly ruined' by her actions.

'The whole system is undermined and . its reputation damaged by people who dig into that fund of money when . they are not entitled to it.' Hulme was a member of the women-only Potters Trotters Running Club and had attended more than 50 events since joining. She had claimed she was sometimes housebound because of her pains. Prosecutor Balvinder Bhatti said: 'When the claim started, the defendant said it could take her up to three minutes to walk 20 yards and she was in pain when she stood up. 'Evidence has since been collected that shows her condition has improved significantly and that she joined a running club. 'She also signed up for Willfield Fitness Centre and signed a certificate declaring herself as medically fit.' Stuart Muldoon, defending, said: 'She [Hulme] is deeply ashamed and has voluntarily been paying back £50 per month since March, despite the threat of custody hanging over her.' Hulme told investigators that she had joined Potters' Trotters to see if she would be physically able to take part in the exercise. She later told officers she had been naive and stupid. Stuart Muldoon, defending, said: 'The money was not being claimed to fund an extravagant lifestyle.

Scientists have found the world's first hybrid sharks in waters off Australia - a discovery that researchers said could have implications for the whole world. The predators are a cross between the common blacktip shark and the Australian blacktip shark. Scientists say interbreeding between the two species is a sign the animals are adapting to warmer waters. They have also warned it could make the sharks stronger. A hybrid black tip shark containing both common and Australian black tip DNA in Australian waters. The mating of the local Australian black-tip shark with its global counterpart, was an unprecedented discovery with implications for the entire shark world . Leading researchers in marine biology discovered 57 animals along a 200 kilometre stretch of ocean from Queensland to New South Wales.Dr Jess Morgan, of the University of Queensland, said it was unusual for sharks to breed this way: 'Sharks physically mate, which is usually a good way to make sure you don't hybridize with the wrong species.' Simpendorfer said that if the hybrid . proved to be stronger than the two pure breeds, it might eventually . replace them, 'We don't know whether that's the case here, but certainly . we know . that they are viable, they reproduce and that there are multiple . generations of hybrids. 'Certainly it appears that they are fairly fit individuals.'

Scientists said on January 3, 2012 that they had discovered the world's first hybrid sharks in Australian waters, a potential sign the predators were adapting to cope with warmer waters . Dr Jennifer Ovenden of the Queensland Department of Primary Industries said: 'Hybridization could enable the sharks to adapt to environmental change, as the smaller Australian black tip currently favours tropical waters in the north while the larger common black tip is more abundant in sub-tropical waters along the south-eastern Australian coastline.'","Two shark species mate in waters off Australia .

Rital and Ritag Gaboura, who are 11 months old, survived at odds of one in 10million. They had four complex operations at London’s Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital. Little miracles: Sisters Ritaj (left) and Rital Gaboura after their successful operation . The sisters, who were born in . Khartoum, Sudan, were brought to Britain for the procedures by their . parents Abdelmajeed Gaboura, 31, and, Enas, 27, who are both doctors. By the time they arrived, Ritag’s heart was already failing. The girls were separated over four . stages. Two initial operations took place in May, before tissue . expanders were inserted in July and the final separation was attempted . on August 15. The parents had approached children’s . charity Facing the World for help, and the organisation funded and . arranged their separation. The girls suffered from the rare condition of craniopagus, and the surgery was carried out by a team led by David Dunaway. A statement from Facing the World said: ‘Within days the twins were back on the general ward interacting and playing as before. Joined together: The twins were born with their heads fused, a rare condition that only one in 10million survive . ‘Their laughter and delight in the world has been an inspiration throughout the months of worry. ‘Very soon, their parents will be able to fulfil their dream of taking home two healthy, separate daughters.’ The girls’ parents said: ‘We are very thankful to be able to look forward to going home with two separate, healthy girls. 'We are very grateful to all the . doctors who volunteered their time and to Facing the World for . organising all the logistics and for paying for the surgery. ‘We feel very lucky that our girls . have been able to have the  surgery that they needed, but we also know . of other children who need complete sponsorship and families who are . searching for someone to help them.’ Conjoined twins are extremely rare, . occurring in only one in every 100,000 live births. They are three times . more likely to be girls. In nearly three-quarters of cases, the twins are connected mid-torso. Just 4 per cent of cases involve fused skulls, and most are stillborn or do not survive longer than 24 hours. Rital and Ritag were born with one of . the most serious forms of the condition as they shared blood vessels . and there was significant blood flow between their brains. Ritag supplied half her sister’s . brain with blood and drained most of it back to her own body to . re-oxygenate – meaning her heart was doing most of the work for both of . them. Any significant drop in blood pressure during surgery could have caused brain damage.

But on arrival staff told him there were no appointments and he was told to go elsewhere. He collapsed on his way out and when he came round he rang NHS Direct again before being taken to hospital by ambulance. Bosses have now launched an investigation. Complaint: Adam Shropshire collapsed in a NHS walk-in centre after they turned him away and had to call for an ambulance when he came round . Mr Shropshire said: 'My illness was not life-threatening - but what if it had been someone having a heart attack?' The 39-year-old was left disabled after contracting pneumonia and a virus last year. Mr Shropshire, who with wife Tanya runs a pub in Leeds, West Yorkshire uses a wheelchair or crutches. On March 19, he fell and cut his knee, which needed stitches. A few days later his leg was red and swollen and he felt ill. He rang NHS Direct who told him to go to a walk-in centre in nearby Bradford. Mr Shropshire took a taxi to Hillside Bridge Health Centre, which is commissioned by NHS Bradford and Airedale but run by a private firm. On arriving just after 2pm on March 24, Mr Shropshire explained he had been sent by NHS Direct. 'The woman said ""they are always doing that, we have got no appointments and you’ll have to go elsewhere"",' he said. He says he struggled towards the exit on his crutches, but felt faint and collapsed in a corridor. After coming round he called NHS Direct and the operator sent an ambulance. Mr Shropshire said he was advised to visit Hillside Bridge Health Centre by NHS Direct but they said they had no spare appointments . That took him to Bradford Royal Infirmary, where he was diagnosed with the skin infection cellulitis. He was treated with antibiotics before being discharged last Monday. Mr Shropshire is now making a complaint about the centre. Yorkshire Ambulance Service confirmed an ambulance was sent to the centre that afternoon. A spokeswoman for Local Care Direct, which runs the facility, said: 'We treat any incident reported to us very seriously and although we have not received a formal complaint about this matter, we are grateful it has been raised and have launched an immediate investigation to establish what happened. 'We would be pleased to discuss this with the patient if they contact us directly.'

Barber pretended that the children, aged between six months and eight, had 'severe' conditions in calls made to tax credit helplines over a three-year period. In reality, all of her children were able-bodied. At the time, Barber, of Worsley, Greater Manchester, was receiving disability living allowance for depression, and used her knowledge of the system in a series of frauds. Manchester Crown Court was told her husband, who she has since split up with, was earning around £23,000 a year throughout.

Almost 900 more drinkers are admitted to hospital every day than five years ago, according to  shocking figures. Official statistics show 1.1million people in England ended up in hospital through drink in 2009/10 – a 25 per cent rise in half a decade. Liverpool is revealed as the nation’s  worst spot for drinkers ending up in casualty or on the wards. Last year, there were 3,114 alcohol-related admissions per 100,000 people in the city – compared with just 850 per 100,000 on the Isle of Wight, the lowest level. Shockingly, in many cases it is women ending up in hospital after having harmed their health through drink. Liverpool’s rate of alcohol-related hospital admission for women (517 per 100,000) was almost eight times the level in Wokingham, Berkshire. Experts blame the ladette culture of binge drinking, the easy availability of cheap alcohol and 24-hour drinking for the frightening extent of drink-related problems on our streets and hospitals. Other figures in the report show 7.6 per cent of drinkers are now considered at serious risk of jeopardising their health – rising to 16.1 per cent in the London borough of Hounslow. That comes against a backdrop of increasing numbers suffering and dying from chronic liver disease. Earlier this week the Daily Mail revealed £2.1billion will be spent on liver disease within five years – 2 per cent of the entire NHS budget. The latest report, from the North West Public Health Observatory at Liverpool John Moores University, reveals Blackpool is the national liver disease capital, while West Somerset saw no deaths at all. The study also contains new estimates on the number of people in England who drink nothing. Clubbers enjoying Liverpool's nightlife. Last year, there were 3,114 alcohol-related admissions per 100,000 people in the city . There are thought to be six million people over 16 who do not drink, with those from certain ethnic or religious backgrounds far more likely to abstain. Almost half the population – 48 per cent – of the ethnically diverse east London borough of Newham are teetotallers, compared with just 6.3 per cent in the Isles of Scilly. However, the Isles of Scilly also had the lowest rates of alcohol-related crime with just 1.15 per 1,000 residents. Official crime statistics show there were 392,787 crimes attributable to alcohol in 2010/11 – 7.6 crimes per 1,000 people. The highest rates of crime linked to drinking by region occurred in London (11.7 crimes per 1,000 residents) while the North East had the lowest rate (5.7 per 1,000).

A clairvoyant who failed to foresee a conviction for benefit fraud  has been ordered to pay back every penny of £33,000 she illegally claimed. Self-styled Tarot reader and fortune-teller Dawn Pearson, 50, was uncovered as a benefits cheat after investigators realised she was being paid to carry out psychic consultations over the phone, a court heard. The . telephone charges were costing a fortune for her customers at £1.53 per . minute, while Pearson was claiming benefits for being too ill to work. Prosecutor . Nuhu Gobir said: 'Fraud investigators from the Department of Work and . Pensions began an investigation into her claim after information she was . working as a psychic. 'She denied she was in either full-time or part-time employment.' The . court heard DWP officers contacted the Absolute Live company where . Pearson was working as a psychic reader and a sex chat-line operator. Mr Gobir said: 'They were unable to provide a breakdown of her hours but records showed she was paid £600 a month at some stage. 'Investigators retrieved her bank statements to show payments from the Absolute Live company. 'Another company Selcast UK Ltd said she had worked on a self-employed basis as a tarot card reader and as a webcame psychic.' The . court heard Pearson unlawfully claimed a total of £33,206.82 in income . support, jobseekers allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit . over 16 months. But at the same time she was advertising herself as a chat line clairvoyant on the Psychic TV website. On . the website, Pearson is pictured next to the description: 'Dawn is an . excellent Psychic clairvoyant, with many years experience.

'She is a trained Reiki healer and has been using all of her gifts to help people for many years. 'Dawn . will happily discuss any pressing relationship or career questions, but . can also give general guidance on self-development using her training . as a life coach.' Pearson . appeared in Swansea Crown Court to admit four charges of benefits fraud . by claiming to be 'unable to work due to illness and disability.' Frank Phillips, defending, told the court that Pearson's claim had started out as legitimate. He . said financial problems arose because she had been the sole carer for . her father and an aunt who both died within a short time of each other. She had been left to pay their funeral costs and had helped out another family member struggling to pay large catalogue debts. 'As time went on she buried her head in the sand and became afraid of informing the authorities,' he said. He added that she had been under 'much trauma' as a result but had now already repaid £600 and was repaying £114 a month. Pearson, of Neath, South Wales, was given a 12-week suspended jailed sentence and ordered to do 180 hours of unpaid work. She stood in court with her head bowed today as she listened to the judge passing sentence. After the hearing she left court with her face hidden behind an umbrella, despite the absence of rain. Asked if she had foreseen what would happen to her she replied: 'I don't know. No. No comment.' She had complained that press coverage had been bad for business in a pre sentence report. Recorder Christopher Clee QC said: 'You claim that you have been ridiculed in the press . and, as a result of which, work has diminished, and that is no great . surprise.' He ordered her to pay back all the money to the taxpayer. He said: 'You’ve already paid back some and it will take you very many years to pay it all back. 'You richly deserve an immediate . prison sentence and the great majority of the British public who work . and pay taxes to benefits cheats like yourself would demand a prison . sentence. 'But I have to work within guidelines. Your sentence will be suspended instead. 'Unpaid work will mean you putting . something back into the community instead of taking out which is what . you did for five years.' After the case, DWP Minister for . Welfare Reform Lord Freud said: 'It’s cases like these that show us why . welfare reform is needed. 'We have a duty to the taxpayer to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them. 'Benefit fraud takes money away from the most vulnerable.

'We are deeply saddened by the loss of these two firefighters,' Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter said. 'It just hurts a great, great deal.' Both firefighters were respected members of the fire department and had been commended for a long list of rescues over the years, Mr Ayers said. Lt Neary, a 37-year veteran of the fire department, served in the Army reserves from 1972 to 1982 and worked as a police officer before joining the fire service. He is survived by his wife, two adult sons and a daughter. He was a mentor to young colleagues like Mr Sweeney and had great instincts while fighting fires, said Timothy McShea, vice-president of the firefighters union. 'He was just a great guy, knew the . job very well,' McShea said. 'He’s like one of these old-school guys. They just have a second sense about them.' Mr Sweeney, who was single, is survived by his parents. His father is recently retired fire Captain David Sweeney. Mr McShea called the 25-year-old 'a good young lad'. 'Danny was a young, aggressive firefighter,' he said. 'A good young lad': Firefighter Daniel Sweeney, 25, who died while battling the blaze . Respected: Lt. Robert Neary, 60, was a 37-year veteran of the department . City officials said the warehouse’s corporate owner, York Street Property Development, had been cited three times since November and a fourth citation was issued after a March 29 inspection, following a community meeting. Officials said that the city was preparing to take the owner to court as required after the first three violations and that, separately, a sheriff’s sale was expected this summer because of unpaid tax and water bills. Fran Burns, commissioner of the . city’s Licenses and Inspections department, said York Street Property . Development had a zoning permit valid until July 2013 for an 81-unit . development. 'This isn’t a . landowner or property owner we couldn’t find; this is someone who had a . very active interest in the property and has an active and open zoning . permit for development,' she said. 'I . don’t understand, when you have a zoning permit for an 81-unit . development, that you don’t understand your responsibility to have a . secure property.' The New York-based law firm Herrick, . Feinstein, representing York Street Property Development, called the . fire 'an unspeakable tragedy'. 'Our . condolences and heartfelt prayers go out to the families of Lt.

Burns said the owners were linked - through York Street Property . Development and another firm - to perhaps 34 other properties in the city. A message left for a Philadelphia law firm officials said represented . them was not returned last night, nor was a message left for . Nahman Lichtenstein. Michael . Lichtenstein told the blog Hidden Daily Philadelphia last month that a . development planned for the warehouse had stalled because of the . economy. He said he wasn’t sure who was responsible for managing and . maintaining the property but 'the building is being kept up'. Residents . tried to seal up the building, cleaned litter around the premises and . reported their concerns to the city over the past year, said Jeff . Carpineta, president of the East Kensington Neighbors Association. They also wrote a letter several . months ago to an attorney listed in public records as the contact for . the owners, Mr Carpineta said. The structure was repeatedly left open . and unsecure, he added. 'The building was becoming an anxiety because a lot of us were concerned about the building burning down,' he said. Mr Carpineta blasted city officials . for not taking the initiative to secure the premises. The cost would . have been minuscule compared with the damage wrought by the blaze, he . said. 'At what point does the city say, ""We need to do what’s right""?' Mr Carpineta said. As . the fire spread from the warehouse, flames poured from the windows as . crews doused water on it from all sides.

Many of its outer walls had crumbled to the . ground by the time the fire was extinguished. Police began banging on the doors of . nearby homes shortly after the fire was reported.

A judge declared a mistrial in a murder trial Wednesday after a newspaper reporter tweeted a photo that included the grainy profile of a juror. The picture, taken and tweeted by Topeka Capital-Journal reporter Ann Marie Bush, includes the profile of a juror set against a brightly lit window. Austin Tabor, 20, was on trial in conjunction with a 2010 shooting that left one man dead and another wounded. Mea culpa: Topeka Capital-Journal reporter Ann Marie Bush caused a mistrial in a murder case by tweeting a grainy photo of a juror . To tweet or not to tweet: This photo shows a grainy profile of one of the jurors in the Austin Tabor trial . The photo in question is no longer in . Ms Bush’s Twitter feed, though several others from the Tabor trial, . including many from where she was sitting in the gallery. She was live-tweeting Wednesday’s proceedings. The Shawnee County district attorney's office in Kansas said it plans to reschedule Tabor's trial for June or July after the abrupt halt to proceedings in Topeka one day after attorneys presented opening statements. 'One of the photos apparently showed one or more of the jurors,' Lee McGowan, spokesman for the district attorney's office, told the Associated Press. 'It was brought to the court's attention and ultimately a mistrial was declared.' Running list: Ms Bush was live-tweeting the trial, posting several other pictures . The trial: Austin Tabor, 20, was on trial for first-degree murder he allegedly committed in 2010 . According to McGowan, the judge had agreed to allow camera phones in the courtroom, but said no photos were to be taken of jurors. Capital-Journal managing editor Tomari Quinn responded to comments on the newspaper's website by saying the photo was a mistake and the 'reporter is miserable about it.' 'The juror was seated next to a window and, on the reporter's smartphone, wasn't seen against the incoming light,' Quinn wrote. Publisher Gregg Ireland said the reporter was aware of the rules. 'The Capital-Journal regrets the error and loss of the court's time,' he said. 'We will use this as a training opportunity for our staff members as they strive to bring information to our readers in digital and print media.' Agreement: The judge had agreed to allow camera phones in the courtroom, but said no photos were to be taken of jurors . Snapshot: From the gallery, she also got a shot of Austin Tabor himself . That corresponds with rules established by the Kansas Supreme Court for cameras in courtrooms, including that individual jurors are not to be photographed. 'In courtrooms where photography is impossible without including the jury as part of the unavoidable background, the photography is permitted, but close-ups which identify individual jurors are not permitted,' the court said. A hearing to reschedule the trial is set for Thursday. Tabor is accused of shooting and killing 20-year-old Matthew Mitchell near Topeka West High School on October 23, 2010 and is charged with felony first-degree murder, as well as conspiracy to sell marijuana within 1,000 feet of a school zone. The Capital-Journal guessed that the trial would last perhaps five to six days. Mr Mitchell’s cousin, Houston James, told the Capital-Journal that the news was disappointing. ‘I’ve been waiting for this day about two years,’ he said. ‘It was going straight smoothly until today.’ Mr James was slated to testify in the trial.","Topeka Capital-Journal reporter Ann Bush tweeted picture with juror in it .

"By . Beth Stebner . UPDATED: . 12:54 EST, 24 February 2012 . A seasoned television anchor who was bitten in the face by an 85-pound dog during a live broadcast earlier this month has spoken out about the frightening experience two weeks after her attack. Kyle Dyer of Denver’s KUSA-TV gave her first interview yesterday, bravely showing scars on her face, which include a V-shaped scar on her upper lip where skin had to be grafted. The anchor told the Denver Post that the first thoughts that went through her mind after the Argentine Mastiff bit her was: ‘I’m bleeding, and it had to be on television!’ Scroll down for video (Warning: Graphic content) In good form: TV anchor Kyle Dyer has had two surgeries since she was attacked by a Mastiff February 8 but looks to be healing quickly . Battle scar: A V-shaped scar can be seen on the anchor's top lip, as well as bite marks on her nose and lower lip . Despite the painful weeks of recovery, two surgeries, and the long road ahead, Ms Dyer said she feels lucky and calls the attack ‘a fluke.’ ‘It could have been so much worse,’ she said. She was bitten in the face during a live taping of her show February 8. ‘It may seem like a superficial business, but the people out there in Colorado are not superficial,’ she told the Post. She said she’s received an outpouring of support from people who have also been bitten by dogs and who are wishing for a speedy recovery. ‘I just keep reading those letters and know that I’m going to heal. I’m going to be better than ever,’ she said. The news of the attack spread like wildfire around the world. Ms Dyer said she personally witnessed the breadth of the news by way of her niece, who lives in Lithuania. On TV: Kyle Dyer, right, had knelt down to pet Max when he attacked. He is seen here with his owner, Michael Robinson, and the firefighter that rescued him . Attack: In a flash, Max bares his teeth and lashes out at Ms Dyers face. Animal control officers called it a 'pretty major bite.' Ferocious: Though immediate reports said that he was not properly vaccinated, the owners of the dog have put out a statement saying that he was up-to-date with all of his shots . She said her niece read about the attack in the town’s local newspaper. ‘There’s so many different learning things that have come out of this,’ she said. She was injured February 8 while doing an on-air segment with the dog’s owner and a fire-fighter who had rescued the Mastiff from an icy pond in suburban Lakewood the day before. She was petting the dog’s head seconds before it bit her.’ 'I know that I’m going to heal. I’m going to be better than ever.' -Anchor Kyle Dyer . Over Valentine’s Day weekend, the anchor wrote on her Facebook page that her mouth was stitched shut so the graft over her lips could receive better blood circulation. While more surgeries may be in her future, Ms Dyer won’t know for certain until this summer, as doctors asses her progress. Ms Dyer, who had been working at the Denver station for over 15 years, underwent reconstructive surgery and over 70 stitches after the attack. She said she harbours no ill will toward the dog. ‘It was just an accident,’ she said, saying that she’s glad he is back with his owners. Part of the team: Ms Dyer (left) has been . working for the station for over 15 years, many of which she has . co-anchored with Gary Shapiro (right) Struggle: Max the dog was filmed swimming around in an icy pool, unable to escape . A number of viewers expressed . concern that the dog would be euthanized as a result of the incident, . which was something they appeared angry about. 'It was clearly human fault. Why should the animal be blamed for both the owner an kyle's mistake? Argentine mastiffs, also known as the . Argentine Dogo, are known as big-game hunters and historically have . gone after wild boars and pumas. While they are now used as pets, they were bred from a rather violent group of dogs. Because of the dogs' violent nature, several areas have banned the breed, including Aurora, Colorado. Aurora borders Denver, where the broadcast took place. The . animal is also banned in New York City public housing, and laws in the . UK allow police to take the dogs away from their owners and prosecute . them. Hope he isn't put down, it would be a crime,' wrote Bruno Naletto. Brendan Flynn echoed that sentiment, writing: 'Lord knows 9News will hear from all of us and alot more if Max is put down.' Unless the dog has rabies - which it is not showing signs of - it will not be put down. Even if the vaccinations are current, the owners will definitely face two charges from Denver Animal Care and Control: a penalty for having the dog bite someone and a second penalty for having the dog off its leash at the time. 'While we normally walk Max on-leash, we understand that by letting him off-leash in an open area away from anyone was still a mistake. We will never walk him off-leash in public areas after this,' the Robinsons said in their statement. Max was brought into the studio after the station's news chopper captured . video footage of a firefighter rescuing Max from a freezing pond Monday . after he fell through the ice and couldn't make it out. 'I know that she is a great journalist . who loves happy stories - this was a happy story,' her co-anchor Gary . Shapiro said in a note to fans. 'Kyle was glad she got assigned to it, because she loves animals,' Mr Shapiro said. Though she is out of the hospital, her recovery is just beginning. Ms Dyer, who is married and has children, is expected to take several weeks to return to work. 'She's . doing well, and will make a recovery, and we're all thinking about her . and her family,' said 9News vice president Patti Dennis.

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 12:13 EST, 1 March 2012 . The Duchess of Cambridge's millionaire parents are at the centre of a property row following accusations they've received special treatment over plans to improve their mansion. Michael and Carole Middleton have submitted plans to improve their Berkshire country home through an application which can normally be viewed by any member of the public. But neighbours have claimed the Duchess's parents are receiving 'special treatment', as the plans to build an extension, annexe and covered parking have been hidden from public view by West Berkshire Council. Neighbours of Carole and Michael Middleton have complained that the local council 'hiding' their planning application is 'unfair' Those wishing to see the plans in person have to submit a written request and gain 'acceptance' of their ID from the local authority. Normally any member of the public can view planning applications on council websites or in person by visiting council offices. But West Berkshire Council said today the plans cannot be viewed for 'security reasons and a request made on behalf of the family', and have given no explanation how to provide acceptable ID. Kate and her sister Pippa grew up at the mansion in the village of Bucklebury, Berkshire, where their parents still live. Kate and Pippa have grown up in the Berkshire house which their parents Carole and Michael want to expand . Michael and Carole Middleton were today accused of getting special treatment, however, as planning application laws which apply to all other members of the public have not been applied to them. The refusal by West Berkshire Council will be even more frustrating for Bucklebury residents given that just two months ago a local authority gave the public access to security plans for Kensington Palace. Despite the local authority being asked to keep the documents secret, anyone can request access to see security plans for the Palace in which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are due to move in to next year. One neighbour of the Middletons, who . did not wish to be named, said: 'There are other people in the village . who’ve put in planning applications for house extensions and they . haven’t received this special treatment. It’s just not fair.' Another . Bucklebury villager added: 'They’re no better than lots of other people . round here so why should they think they can lord it over everyone like . this?' The application is a sharp contrast to . two other Bucklebury families who’ve submitted plans in the last month . and who weren’t even given the option to ask for their details to be . kept hidden. The council . said the decision to shield the Middleton plans was taken by planning . managers, implying it did not go before elected members of the authority . where the principle of whether it’s the right thing to do could have . been debated. Council . spokesman Keith Ulyatt denied the public were being denied a chance to . view the plans, but admitted the 'sensitive nature' of the application . was the reason. He said 'We haven’t taken it off show. It was never on show on the website. It hasn’t been concealed. 'There . are instances of other planning applications where plans have been . withheld. As a planning authority we are not unique in this.' Howver . he conceded that even plans concerning AWE, the top-secret atomic . weapons base at Aldermaston, near Newbury, do not always get the same . level of protection as the Middletons’ scheme. The parents of the Duchess of Cambridge want to build an extension and annexe on their country pile in Bucklebury, Berkshire . 'Many applications from AWE do not, in fact, include details for security reasons. Even on copies of plans presented to us, there are sometimes details held back by them for security reasons' he said. The council says a chart will be kept showing who presented an 'acceptable' written request and ID and was allowed to look at the Middleton plans at the council offices in Market Street, Newbury. The chart will be 'kept under lock and key' at the council offices until the application is decided, at which point the chart will be placed on the public file. Mr Ulyatt added 'Dealing with the plans in the way we have, we know how many people have viewed the plans. This supports the security stance, yet leaves the process open.' The council is expected to make a decision on the application before April 6th. With their daughter marrying a Prince, the Middletons have been thrust into the limelight and have been accused of cashing in on their new-found fame to build up their business interests and wealth. It’s the second row to rock West Berkshire council in a fortnight - earlier this month campaigners including author Richards Adams criticised the authority for nodding through plans to bulldoze beautiful Watership Down to make way for 2,000 new houses. Opponents say it paves the way for the partnership behind the plans to pocket a £70 million jackpot for the 100-acre site.","Carole and Michael Middleton submit application to build extension and annexe on their country home .

The man convicted of murdering an Atlanta Braves relief pitcher in 1995 has been released from prison ten years early, leaving the baseball player’s widow furious. Dave Shotkoski was shot dead by Neal Evans in a botched armed robbery attempt in 1995; now his wife Felicia is incensed with the justice system for failing her. ‘I feel cheated, but so should the people on the streets with him today,’ she said, adding that the U.S. justice system seems to ‘favour the criminal’s rights over the victim’s.’ Scroll down for video . Furious: Widow Felicia Shotkoski, seen in 1995, says she feels 'cheated' that her husband's killer Neal Evans, right, was released from prison ten years early after being convicted of second-degree murder; he is pictured in court in 1997 . Wrong place, wrong time: Dave Shotkoski, a relief pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, was murdered in March 1995 during a botched armed robbery . Ms Shotkoski told FoxNews.com that she found out about Evans’ release after receiving an automated message from the Florida Department of Corrections. Priors: Neal Evans had been released early from prison five times since 1990 . His first murder trial – which carried the death penalty – resulted in a hung jury, allowing Evans to make a plea deal in the following trial which left him with a 27-year sentence. Evans, now 47, was convicted in 1997 for the murder of Mr Shotkoski in March of 1995. He was imprisoned at South Bay Correctional Facility in Florida. According to Ms Shotkoski, several key witnesses did not testify in the second trial. ‘They put a convicted murderer on the streets, knowingly put a convicted murderer on the streets,’ Ms Shotkoski said. She said the prison officials told her Evans earned 20 days of ‘gain time’ for every month of good behaviour, thus scrapping ten years off his sentence. He is now living with his girlfriend in Riviera Beach. However, he has a night-time curfew and must frequently report to his probation officer. Conditions of his probation include no drug use and no fraternizing with known felons. Prison records show that Neal was serving his seventh prison sentence – his lengthy criminal record includes kidnapping, armed robbery, and burglary. According to wptv.com, this is Evans’ fifth early release from prison since 1990. Hard time: Evans served 17 years of his sentence at the South Bay Correctional Facility in Florida . After his death: The Braves won the World Series in October 1995 against the Cleveland Indians . ‘The laws have to change,’ Ms Shotkoski told FoxNews.com. ‘The government should not be letting convicted murderers back on the street.’ Mr Shotkoski, who was 30 at the time, was walking on a service road on the evening of March 24. He was three blocks away from the hotel where the Braves were staying for spring training, and was shot several times on his after-dinner stroll during a botched armed robbery attempt. His widow now lives in Chicago with their now-17-year-old daughter Alexis. She said she and Alexis have to live with the after-effects of the crime forever, while Evans can go on living his life. ‘Our justice system doesn’t make sense,’ Ms Shotkoski told wptv.com. ‘They’re supposed to protect people’s rights and safety, yet it seems to save the criminals’ rights over the victims.’ Watch video here: .","Atlanta Braves relief pitcher Dave Shotkoski, 30, shot dead in botched armed robbery in 1995 .

Her Vibram FiveFingers shoes - which look like a pair of rubber gloves with toes - cost £85 and attracted a whole host of the Hollywood elite. But if you want to be in vogue without breaking the bank, these bright, flexible running shoes from Spanish company One Moment might be an affordable solution. Priced at £8. the 2mm thick biodegradable shoe, will benefit your bank balance as well as the environment . Costing just £8, they are the latest invention for barefoot runners - a trend which Footwear News says will be bigger than ever this year. The slimline rubber shoe has a sole of just 2mm thick, giving the wearer a sensation of being close to the earth. And as an added bonus, being made from 100 per cent natural materials, they will eventually biodegrade once discarded. Inspiration for the product comes from the Amazonian tribes, who painted their feet soles with natural latex obtained from Hevea trees. In doing so, they were able to move around the jungle comfortably during the rainy season. In time, the fine latex layer would degrade back into the environment. Best foot forward: Scarlett Johansson has sparked a growing trend . True, some might be perturbed by  the odd appearance of the colourful footwear, but given that they are no more unflattering than the odd-looking Vibrams, which have proved popular with the likes of Prince Harry, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Hudson, these shoes might just get some takers. Describing the product makers say: 'A modern, sober and elegant style, combining technology and designed to offer maximum comfort and grip.' Each pair is unisex and from January there will be a XXS children's range available. In keeping with the perpetual colour-blocking trend customers can choose from a range of eye-catching shades including lipstick red, lime green and bubblegum pink. Manufacturers claim they are suitable for a range of activities including running and when they aren't being worn they can be rolled up and stored in a pocket. However some scientists, who believe that running in no shoes is more beneficial than wearing minimalist slippers, have criticised  shoe brands such as Asics Nike, New Balance and Saucony for cashing in on the celebrity trend. Professor Daniel Howell, who teaches human anatomy and physiology at Liberty University and has spent 95 per cent of his life shoe-free, said: 'Walking and running are extremely complicated from a biomechanical perspective ... and if you add a device to your foot, it alters it.

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 02:05 EST, 19 January 2012 . Five people were shot to death more than three years ago in a homeless encampment beneath a Los Angeles-area freeway because of unpaid drug debts between one of the victims and an alleged gang member, police said Wednesday. Long Beach police Chief Jim McDonnell announced the arrests of David Ponce, 31, and Max Rafael, 25 - alleged members of the Nuthood Watts criminal street gang. Both men are charged with five special-circumstance murders, one count each of kidnapping to commit another crime and conspiracy to commit a crime, along with gun and gang allegations, McDonnell said. Scroll down for video . Arrested: David Ponce, 31, was charged with five special-circumstance murders following his Wednesday arrest . Charged: Max Rafael, 25, faces the same charges for the shooting deaths more than three years ago in a homeless encampment in Los Angeles . Both men are eligible for the death penalty. They're being held without bail. Rafael is expected to be arraigned today and Ponce on Friday. The November 2008 mass killings baffled investigators after the bodies of three men and two women were found on a Sunday morning in a seedy neighbourhood of warehouses and apartment buildings. A phone tip led authorities to the bodies, which had been there at least a day. Police said an ongoing feud between Ponce and Lorenzo Villicana, 44, over unpaid drug debts was the motive for the crimes. 'I'd like to make it clear that these victims were not targeted because they were homeless,' McDonnell said. 'This encounter stemmed from a personal vendetta of one of the suspects as the result of an ongoing dispute with one of the victims over narcotics. Tragic end: Police said an ongoing feud between Ponce and Lorenzo Villicana, 44, (pictured) over unpaid drug debts was the motive for the crimes . A week before the slayings, Villicana was robbed. On the day of the murders, Ponce enlisted Rafael, and the two men recognized 41-year-old Hamid Shraifat as someone who knew Villicana and might be able to find him, said police Lt Lloyd Cox. The men kidnapped Shraifat, who led them to the encampment where Villicana was, along with Frederick Neumeier, 53, Katherine Verdun, 24, and Vanessa Malaeplue, 34, a mother of six, authorities said. Police believe Villicana was shot first and the other victims were killed to ensure there would be no witnesses to the crime. 'Within a few weeks of it, we had a theory that this was a personal incident between the suspect and one of the victims and it was a matter of proving that theory whether it was true or not,' Cox said. Ponce and Rafael were charged on Wednesday. News of their arrests comes a day after a suspected serial killer was charged in the stabbing deaths of four homeless men in nearby Orange County over the past month. The timing was pure coincidence, officials said, as police were waiting for prosecutors to file charges. Encampment: The 2008 mass killings baffled investigators after the bodies of three men and two women were found in a seedy neighbourhood near the 405 .

The Long Beach killings happened in an area known as a homeless encampment and drug hangout in the shadow of two intersecting freeways. Police said they received very few phone calls in the days following the killings. The anonymous tipster eventually was contacted, but he had no connection to the crime or the people involved, Cox said. Ponce, who has the words 'Nut' and 'Hood' tattooed below his eyes, also was charged with kidnapping and murder for a slaying in Lancaster two years ago. In addition, police believe he may be responsible for at least two other murders in Long Beach between 2000 and 2003. Ponce has been in jail since August 2010 and he has faced prior weapons, narcotic and burglary charges. Rafael has been behind bars since last summer and also faced prior narcotic and weapons charges.

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 08:33 EST, 21 September 2011 . A leading FBI analyst who gave a lecture last year criticising mainstream Muslims has been caught on camera giving a second presentation urging agents to 'forget Al Qaeda' and 'go after the Death Star' of Islam. The Bureau's William Gawthrop was recorded making the 'dangerous' remarks to an audience of over 60 law enforcement officials during a counter-terrorism seminar in New York three months ago. Gawthrop's presentation in June told the audience that the fight against Al Qaeda is a 'waste' compared to the threat posed by the ideology of Islam itself. Speech: FBI analyst William Gawthrop gave a presentation urging law enforcement officials to 'forget Al Qaeda' The controversial training seminar then went on to compare the 'internal forces which seek to exert Islamic rule' to the Death Star in the Star Wars films. Gawthrop's 25-minute speech has since been branded 'mind-numbingly stupid and dangerous' and has drawn strong criticism from top Senators and representatives from Arab and Muslim-American groups. During the lecture on June 8, Gawthrop tells the audience: 'We waste a lot of analytic effort talking about the type of weapon, the timing, the tactics. All of that is irrelevant... if you have an Islamic motivation for actions.' According to Gawthrop, even taking down hostile states like Iran is futile, since 'there are still internal forces that will seek to exert Islamic rule again.' He added: 'Look at the motive first... if you have an Islamic motivation for actions, group those together. 'So what is this doctrine? It is an expansive doctrine with a single objective: world imperial, controlling the world. 'That sounds grandiose... but it is a stated objective. The means to do that is jihad. Jihad is rooted in doctrine. There are identifiable rules of engagement and we will discuss that.' Controversial: Gawthrop's speech goes on to compare certain parts of Islam to the Death Star in Star Wars . It has since emerged that Gawthrop said before the speech he was speaking as a private citizen, rather than an FBI analyst . Gawthrop goes on: 'If you remember Star Wars, that ventilation shaft that goes down to into the depths of the Death Star, they shot a torpedo down there. That’s a critical vulnerability.' During the presentation Gawthrop then waved a laser pointer at his projected PowerPoint slide, highlighting the words 'Holy Texts' and 'Clerics.' He then adds: 'We should be looking at, should be aiming at, these.' Aki Peritz, a former intelligence analyst at the National Counterterrorism Center, now with the Third Way think-tank in Washington, told Wired.com: 'This is mind-numbingly stupid and dangerous. 'If we were to follow his idea to a logical extension, that means we have individuals in every single government agency, at top levels, from CIA to the Defense Department to members of Congress, that are part of this cabal to destroy Western civilization. 'If you truly believe that, then this is McCarthyism on steroids.' According to Wired.com, Gawthrop . delivered his speech at the New York chapter of Infragrad, a . public-private partnership between the FBI and the private sector. Infragrad has chapters across the . U.S. 'dedicated to sharing information and intelligence to prevent . hostile acts against the United States'. Bosses at Infragrad have since defended the comments made by Mr Gawthrop, insisting that he made a 'good presentation'. Joseph Concannon, president and CEO . of New York Metro Infragard, told the Danger Room website: 'We actually . thought Bill had a very good presentation. Mr Gawthrop's comments about Islam were branded 'stupid and dangerous' 'We gained a better understanding of the constraints put on [Muslims] in cooperating with law enforcement by some of the rules and policies they have in place.' In the June lecture, Gawthrop is said to have spoken as a private citizen, not as an FBI analyst. The FBI has publicly declared that its counterterrorism training seminars linking 'mainstream' Muslims to terrorists was a 'one time only' affair that began and ended in April 2011. Probe: An FBI spokesperson said the bureau would conduct a comprehensive review into the footage, as FBI training should be 'consistent with its core values' The latest disclosure by Wired.com prompted the FBI to say it is conducting a comprehensive review of all FBI training and reference materials that may, in any way, relate to religion or culture. An FBI spokesperson said: 'We are consulting with outside experts on the development and use of training materials, to best ensure the highest level of quality for new agent training, continuing education for all employees, and any FBI-affiliated training. 'All training will be consistent with FBI core values, the highest professional standards and adherence to the Constitution.'","FBI man compares Islam to Star Wars Death Star .

Lady Liberty is made of copper 3/32 inches thick, which is the same as putting two pennies together, but it has naturally oxidised over time to form the green ‘patina’ coating. Different: The Statue of Liberty in New York hasn't always been green - as it was made with an exterior of copper and originally had a much more shiny appearance (as shown in this mocked-up edited image) Old pictures: These adverts for Liebig's beef extract, left, and Superior Silk thread, right, were both issued soon after the statue was built in the 1880s and show Lady Liberty in her original form . This coating actually protects the copper behind it from naturally wearing away. But the copper, along with the statue’s height, also makes her a welcoming target for lightning strikes. The current replacement torch was installed 25 years ago and is a copper flame covered in 24 carat gold, according to the National Parks Service website. The statue, which is located on Liberty Island in New York, will be closed for a year at the end of next month as it undergoes a $27million renovation to redevelop the interior. But the renovations are limited to the monument, Liberty Island will remain open and the statue itself will be mostly unobstructed from view, officials said.

The National Parks Service, which manages the Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island, said it will close the monument on October 28, after the 125th anniversary of its dedication. Joseph A. Natoli Construction Corporation of Pine Brook, New Jersey, will install improved stairways and upgrade electrical and fire suppression systems, elevators and bathrooms. The statue was closed after 9/11 for security precautions, but the base reopened in 2004 after a $20million security upgrade and the observation deck at the top of the crown reopened in 2009.

The former employee who is suing TV chef Paula Deen and her brother Bubba Hiers for sexual harassment and racism has a checkered financial past, according to reports. Lisa Jackson, who worked for the siblings at their co-owned restaurant in Savannah, Georgia, has owed a total of $63,948 in Georgia state taxes and federal taxes dating from 2001 to 2005. But, while she may be accused of using the explosive lawsuit as a way to make fast cash, RadarOnline.com added that nearly all the tax liens have been settled or released. Sued: Paula Deen (left) and brother Bubba Hiers (right) have . been accused of sexual harassment in a lawsuit by an ex-employee of their restaurant - but it appears the plaintiff has a checkered financial past . Yet it could throw doubt on the claims made by Ms Jackson, 48, who filed a lawsuit in Georgia claiming the working conditions at Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House were intolerable. The former general manager claimed Bubba brought . 'inescapable pornography' to the workplace, cracked sexist jokes and . told Lisa to bring in photos of herself when she was younger, telling . her 'you've got nice legs'. Jackson, who worked at the restaurant . between 2005 and 2010, also accuses the duo of racism, and cites . examples of their use of the term n*****. In . one, she explains Deen appointed her to handle the catering and staff . for Bubba's 2007 wedding and she asked Deen what the servers should . wear. 'Well . what I would really like is a bunch of little n******s to wear . long-sleeve white shirts, black shorts and black bow ties,' Jackson . claimed Deen said, according to RadarOnline.com. She continued: 'You know in the Shirley Temple days, they used to tap dance around. 'Now, that would be a true Southern wedding wouldn't it? But we can't do that because the media would be on me about that.' Scene: Jackson worked at the restaurant, pictured, in Savannah, Georgia between 2005 and 2010 . In another example, the lawsuit writes that in front of several employees, Bubba said 'they should send President Obama to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico so he could n******-rig it'. In . a third example of racism, the suit claims that black employees had to . use a restroom at the back of the restaurant, while white employees . could share the customer restroom.

'Bubba Hiers is a frequent customer of pornography web sites and would download and view such sites at work. In . the small office he shared with Jackson, it was impossible for her to . avoid the pornography,' the lawsuit states, according to . RadarOnline.com. At a weekly manager's meeting, Bubba allegedly took along a paper copy of an email entitled 'Why gay marriage should be legal'. It showed pictures of women having sex with women, and was passed around the table. 'No outrage was expressed and no action was taken in response to his behavior,' the suit states. As . well as the sexist comments, which the suit notes were directed at more . than one employee, Jackson claims there were other sickening goings-on . at the restaurant.

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 04:06 EST, 29 December 2011 . A popular teddy bear sold across North America is being recalled - because of fears its plastic eyes could fall out and choke children to death. The Build-A-Bear Workshop company has issued the urgent warning for 300,000 of its Chinese-made Colourful Hearts Teddy Bears, which it sells in the U.S. and Canada. No injuries have been reported so far - but it is the third time this year the DIY stuffed animal workshop, which has stores across the world including the UK, has had safety concerns over its products. Faulty: The 16in high Colourful Hearts Teddy Bear has black plastic eyes and sells in the U.S. for $18 . The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission warned parents to be on their guard if they had bought their children the 16in high bear that has black plastic eyes and sells in the U.S. for $18. It said: 'The Teddy Bear's eyes could loosen and fall out, posing a choking hazard to children.' The company revealed the bears were sold at its stores and through its website from April to December. A total of 284,000 in the U.S. and 13,200 in Canada are affected. A statement said: 'Consumers should immediately take the recalled teddy bear from children and return it to any Build-A-Bear store to receive a coupon for any available stuffed animal from Build-A-Bear.' Recall: The Colourful Hearts Teddy is the subject of a recall by Build-A-Bear Workshop . It also advised buyers to contact the firm at 866-236-5683 with additional questions. The recall is the final blow to what has been a humiliating year for the firm, which was fined $6,000 earlier this month by the CPSC for failing to report a dangerous defect in its toy beach chairs sold between 2001 and 2009. A CPSC statement said: 'The sharp edges of the chair's folding wooden frame can pinch, lacerate or amputate a child's fingertip if the finger is caught between the frame as the chair is folded. 'The company became aware of 10 reports of injury between July 2007 and January 2009, yet did not report to the Commission until March 2009.' Affected: The company revealed the bears were sold at its stores and through its website from April to December . And in August the company voluntarily recalled 26,500 Love Hugs Peace Lapel Pins, also manufactured in China, that contained excessive amounts of lead-based paint. Build-A-Bear spokesman Jill Saunders told STLtoday.com the latest blunder could be down to 'substandard fabric' may be to blame for the eyes tearing out of the toy. She said: 'We discovered the issue while doing ongoing quality and safety checks and immediately reported the issue to the CPSC and began the recall process. 'That we have conducted three product recalls this year despite the fact that we have not received a single injury report related to any of those three products clearly demonstrates how seriously we take product safety.' Ed Mierzwinski, a consumer advocate working for the National Association of State Public Interest Research Groups, said the firm needed to review its management and risk analysis. He said: 'This company - its recent time line - gives me some concern that they really need to review their management and their risk analysis to make sure they are in compliance with the law to protect children.'","Colourful Hearts Teddy Bear sold in U.S. and Canada .

"By . Daniel Miller . UPDATED: . 11:02 EST, 13 February 2012 . Britain is facing a severe drought this summer after the driest winter on record, experts have warned. Without heavy rainfall in the immediate . future, extreme water shortages could hit many parts of the country - causing parched landscapes, rivers drying up and hosepipe bans in . the summer. Such conditions would have a huge knock-on effect for farmers, food production, tourism and local wildlife. Warning: Low levels in Ogston Reservoir in Derbyshire last year. 2011 was the driest year in England Wales for 90 years and the environment agency has warned that without rain in the near future, England will . experience a severe drought . Officials from the Environment Agency . say the worst affected areas would include the Midlands, East Anglia . and the south-east of England - and underground supplies are already . being used to keep the rivers flowing. The impending crisis has been building . for the past 18 months - reservoirs were already low at the beginning . of last year, and 2011 was the driest year in England and Wales for 90 . years. Rivers have . already dried up in several areas - and agency workers have been forced . to rescue fish stranded in pools, moving them to areas where water is . flowing. Ian Baker, . head of water, land and biodiversity at the Agency, said: 'Across the . Midlands, East Anglia and the South East we have had exceptionally low . rainfall over the last five months, following on from a dry Spring in . 2011. 'In . East Anglia, soils are still very dry so they are not soaking up the . rainfall. Ground water levels are very low and most of the rivers rely . on ground water to keep them flowing. Dried up: The River Kennet in Wiltshire was reduced to a trickle in December after months of low rainfall . 'The . last five months in East Anglia have been the driest period since . records began in 1910 - that means some ground water levels are also at . record low levels. 'It is likely we will still see very low ground water levels even if it rains and that will impact on farmers, the . environment, wildlife and public water supplies. At the RSPB reserve in Titchwell Marsh, . Norfolk, springs have dried up leaving birds such as this bearded tit . struggling to find food . 'Once you get past April, the plants start growing and start taking up the water as well. The next few months are critical in terms of refilling ground water. 'We are looking at different rainfall scenarios in terms of how much we will get and we are using that to advice farmers to think about the crops they are planting. We are also ensuring water companies are doing all they can to preserve resources. 'It is a case of them engaging with customers to explain the situation and encourage them to use water carefully. A lot of people do not make the connection between water coming out of their taps and the nearby river. 'We are making sure we have specialist equipment ready to carry out fish rescues - we have already seen some ponds and streams drying up and we have had to rescue the fish. ' At the RSPB reserve in Titchwell Marsh, Norfolk, springs have dried up and many of the birds, including populations of bearded tits, marsh harriers and reed warblers, are struggling to find food. Mr Baker said: 'The birds will struggle to find food and that will impact on their ability to breed in the Spring and survive - the same happens with fish.' He went on: 'Over the next two to three months, across East Anglia and the South East, it needs to rain more than average and it must be steady to put us in a healthier position. By April, we will have a feel for how difficult the summer will be.' Otherwise, he said, more fish will be killed and 'farmers will struggle to have enough water to irrigate their crops; yields of potatoes, other vegetables and salad crops will be impacted.'He added: 'It is certainly something to worry about.'","Hosepipe bans likely without heavy rainfall in the near future .

"By . Charles Walford . UPDATED: . 08:21 EST, 21 February 2012 . Charities and businesses will be given cash incentives to get jobless under-18s 'earning or learning', Nick Clegg announced today. The Deputy Prime Minister hopes to defuse the 'ticking time bomb' of youth unemployment with a £126million scheme across England . Organisations will receive up to £2,200 for every young person they help. They will receive an initial payment up front, and more money when the youngsters show progress. Mr Clegg meets young apprentices at K&M McLoughlin Decorating in Islington last week as he appealed for businesses to sign up to the Youth Contract . Unemployment soared in the three months to December . And they will be given 'total freedom' in the methods they use to get 16 and 17-year-olds into work or training. The initiative is part of the coalition's Youth Contract scheme, announced last November in a bid to tackle youth unemployment. Mr Clegg said: 'Sitting at home with nothing to do when you're so young can knock the stuffing out of you for years. 'It is a tragedy for the young people involved - a ticking time bomb for the economy and our society as a whole. 'This problem isn't new, but in the current economic climate we urgently need to step up efforts to ensure some of our most troubled teenagers have the skills, confidence and opportunities to succeed. 'Many of them will have complex problems: truancy, teenage pregnancy, a lack of GCSEs and health problems. 'So helping them onto their feet will not be without challenges and Government cannot do this alone. 'But we all have a duty to reach out to the young people who can be hardest to reach. 'That's . why today I am calling on charities and other organisations at the coal . face to work with Government to help tens and thousands of lost . teenagers onto a brighter path.' Around 55,000 Neets (not in education, . employment or training) who do not hold any GCSEs at grade C or above . will be targeted for the scheme, which is similar to the Government's . Work Programme that sees private contractors paid a fee for getting and . keeping adults in employment. The Deputy Prime Minister has called for measures to defuse the 'ticking time bomb' of youth unemployment . But officials were keen to stress it is the first time the payment-by-results approach has been taken with the younger age group. Organisations will receive an initial fee for taking teenagers on but further payments will only be made when progress - such as sticking with training programmes, undertaking apprenticeships, or holding down jobs - can be shown. Three areas - Liverpool, Leeds-Bradford-Wakefield and Newcastle-Gateshead - will be able to allocate their own pot of money as part of the Government City Deal, set up to give more autonomy to England's core cities. Speaking on Sky News this morning, Mr Clegg said: 'I think it is incredibly important that, at that very vital moment in someone’s life, when they are in their teens, that they don’t lose the ambition and the hope and the optimism about working. 'Because once that is lost, all the evidence is that it has a long-term scarring effect and makes it very difficult for youngsters to move into stable employment as adults.' Children's Minister Tim Loughton said: 'We are committed to supporting those 16 and 17-year-olds who have found it hard to find training or work upon leaving school. Growing problem: Unemployment jumped by nearly 50,000 in the quarter to last December, giving the worst figures since 1995 . 'We want them to receive personal, targeted support from experts who will give them the confidence, skills and motivation to stay in education or find a job with training. 'Providers know how best to support young people back into education training and employment. It's time we put them back on the road to success. 'We are looking forward to receiving some innovative ideas that really work from experienced organisations in all sectors.' This group of teenagers has been singled out because evidence suggests that unemployment early on can have a permanent effect on earning potential. By the age of 42, someone who has been frequently unemployed as a teenager is likely to earn 12-15 per cent less than their peers, the Department for Education said. The announcement comes less than a week after the latest unemployment figures showed that the numbers of 16 to 24-year-olds not in work increased by 22,000 to 1.04million in the three months to December. The last Neets figures, for the third quarter of last year, showed that more than a million 16 to 24-year-olds (1,163,000) - almost one in five - were (not in education, employment or training.","£126million scheme will defuse the 'ticking time bomb' of youth unemployment, says Nick Clegg .

A house once lived in by artist Vincent Van Gogh is to go under the hammer for £475,000 - and comes complete with its very own outside toilet. Described by estate agents as a property in need of 'modernisation', the three-storey property has no central heating but has an English Heritage blue plaque on the outside wall honouring the artist. The painter lived at the home in 1873 after coming to London to work at an art dealers at the age of 20. Van Gogh is said to have spend one of the ‘happiest years of his life’ lodging at the three-bedroom home in Hackford Road, Brixton. Under the hammer: The Brixton house where artist Vincent Van Gogh was once a lodger . 'One of the happiest years of his life': The painter loved the house so much he even sketched it (pictured) The Dutch artist, who resided on the top floor of the three-storey house, even sketched the property, which was built in about 1850. Seven of Van Gogh's paintings are in the ‘most expensive ever sold list’, which were purchased for a combined total of £425million. Sellers Savills have put the house up for sale for the first time in 65 years - and boast that it offers an outside loo and real fireplaces, among other ‘period features’. Russell Taylor, of Savills, said the auction is due to take place on March 27 after the owners decided to sell up after 65 years. Seven of Van Gogh's paintings are in the 'most expensive ever sold list' He added: 'It has probably only changed hands twice since Vincent lived there. 'It needs total modernisation but a lot of features such as the fireplaces where he would have warmed himself on a cold night were covered up so they are not damaged in any way.' Letters sent to his brother Theo say he had fallen in love with the landlady’s daughter Eugenie Loyer, who did not return his love - the spark which some say started his descent into mental illness. In one letter Van Gogh said that Eugenie was ‘quite beautiful and so quiet that you almost forget you are in London’. Savills state: 'At the next Savills Auction, to be held on 27 March, 2012, the Savills team will be auctioning 87 Hackford Road, SW9, the former home of Vincent van Gogh from 1873 -1874. 'At the age of 20 Van Gogh arrived in London to start work at an art dealership in Southampton Street and from August of 1873 he lived at 87 Hackford Road. 'The house was owned by Mrs Loyer who lived there with her daughter, it was Mrs Loyer’s daughter who Van Gogh reputedly first fell in love with. 'There is also a sketch of Hackford Road which includes number 87, this was in the possession of Eugenie Loyer’s grand daughter, Mrs Kathleen Maynard, and is now in the Van Gogh museum, Amsterdam. 'The Hackford Road sketch is the earliest surviving drawing from Vincent’s English period.

"By . Louise Eccles . UPDATED: . 03:13 EST, 15 February 2012 . Experimental: Artist Olafur Eliasson has created the bizarre 'Take A Deep Breath' art work which could be part of the London 2012 Festival . It is a suggestion likely to cause sharp intakes of breath all round. An artist wants £1million of public money to fund a bizarre project asking people to ‘take a deep breath’ in aid of the Olympics. Participants will be encouraged to inhale and exhale on behalf of ‘a person, a movement or a cause’ and then share details of the experience on a website. The concept will apparently promote ‘interconnectivity’ rather than rivalry, challenging the ‘egocentricity’ of the Games. It has been proposed by Berlin-based artist Olafur Eliasson, whose previous work has involved putting a giant sun in the Tate Modern. But despite being earmarked for inclusion at the London 2012 Festival – an Olympics-based arts celebration running from June to September – his new project rails against the event. In a video about the commission,  the Danish-Icelandic artist apparently said: ‘The Olympics reflect the state of the world – the obsession with elite, the obsession with winners, rather than participatory ideas. I was asked by the Olympics to make a work of art that celebrates the Olympics. ‘There’s not a lot to celebrate in the . Olympics and I thought I would make a work of art that exposes some of . the weaknesses of the Olympics.’ Mr Eliasson, 44, has applied to the . Olympic Lottery Distributor (OLD) for £1million – although it is not . known why such a large sum is needed for the website-based project, . called simply Take A Deep Breath. OLD is a body set up to support Olympics projects using money raised by the National Lottery. Previous work: Mr Eliasson created 'The Weather Project' which beamed a giant sun across the Tate Modern . According to the artist, participants . would be asked to take a deep breath and then post a message on a . website about who they did it for and why. A film of people inhaling and . exhaling could also be created. Each ‘breath bubble’ would form a . virtual ‘bubble Earth’ creating ‘a world map defined by shared . aspirations and dreams, rather than national borders’, Mr Eliasson said. Incredibly, the artist hopes 10 per cent of the Earth’s population – 700million people – would take part. Last night Emma Boon, of the . TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the project would certainly ‘win a gold medal . in the money-wasting event’. ‘At a time when budgets are tight and many . households are struggling, it doesn’t seem right to spend so much public . money on this concept,’ she said. Olympics organisers Locog insisted the plan was ‘still in development and subject to funding’. A spokesperson said: 'In late 2011 Manchester International Festival were brought in to produce this project; CREATE are also involved as partners with curatorial support from the Serpentine Gallery.' And Ian Brack, chief executive of the . OLD, said: ‘We have pledged £16.5million of funding for the Cultural . Olympiad, and Mr Eliasson’s application would come from this. ‘Our board will now decide whether they are prepared to let their money be used for this purpose.’ Mr Eliasson declined to comment. Legacy: Examples of the inhalations and exhalations could be kept in a 'permanent archive capsule' near the Olympic Stadium if the project is approved .",Danish artist Olafur Eliasson's online project could receive funding this week .
"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 17:52 EST, 14 November 2011 . Riot-clad law enforcement officers cleared out Oakland's weeks-old anti-Wall Street encampment just before dawn today, arresting Occupy demonstrators and removing tents from a downtown plaza after issuing several warnings over the weekend. Protesters appeared to put up little resistance and officers could be seen calmly leading some demonstrators away in plastic handcuffs. Warnings from authorities had been similar to those issued before officers used tear gas and bean bag projectiles to clear the encampment on October 25. Raid: Police surround members of the clergy before arresting them during the eviction of the Occupy Oakland camp today at dawn . Calm: A police officers removes an Occupy Oakland tent from its encampment after they cleared all the protestors today without much resistance . Pleas: A protester pleads with police officers to let them stay at the Occupy Oakland encampment as they are forceably evicted this morning . Police made more than 20 arrests during Monday's raid, Mayor Jean Quan said. After officers blocked off the streets surrounding Frank Ogawa Plaza, some demonstrators gathered near the barricades and vowed to return. 'I don't see how they're going to disperse us,' 30-year-old Ohad Meyer said. 'There are thousands of people who are going to come back.' The action came a day after police drove hundreds of anti-Wall Street demonstrators from weeks-old encampments in Portland, arresting more than 50 people. Oakland officials stepped up calls for an end to their city's encampment after a man was shot and killed Thursday near the plaza. Police issued a fourth cease and desist order on Sunday night telling demonstrators they couldn't camp there. Oakland Police Public Information Officer: Johnna Watson speaks to members of the media after authorities evicted Occupy Oakland's encampment . Escorted: In the wake of violent confrontations with police, vandalism and the recent shooting near the encampment, Oakland mayor Jean Quan issued eviction notices to protesters . Sadness: A protester cries as as police conduct the eviction of the Occupy Oakland campsite which passed off relatively peacefully with only 20 arrests . Quan had allowed protesters to reclaim the disbanded site after facing criticism following the October 25 raid. The camp grew substantially afterward, although city officials said on Sunday the number of tents has dropped by about 30 to 150 since November 8. 'We really tried to make this a safe and peaceful day,' Quan said after the tents were taken down today. 'Even though there are those who disagree with my decision, we hope it is peaceful. We need them to honor and respect our city and keep it safe.' Chaos: Though Occupy Oakland went off peacefully, police in riot gear descended on Occupy Portland yesterday . Protesters would be allowed to return to the plaza after the tents were cleared out, but they wouldn't be allowed to spend the night, the mayor said. 'We've been consistent that they can use it as a free speech location,' she said. 'They can gather tonight, but no camping is allowed.' On Sunday, friends confirmed that an Iraq War veteran who was injured in the October 25 raid, Scott Olsen, has been released from the hospital. Olsen, who suffered a skull fracture, became a rallying point for protesters nationwide. Dottie Guy of Iraq Veterans Against the War said on Sunday thatOlsen was released last week. He can now read and write, but still has trouble talking, she added. Officials across the country have been urging an end to similar gatherings in the wake of three deaths in different cities, including two deaths by gunfire. Demands for Oakland protesters to pack up increased after a man was shot and killed on Thursday near the encampment site. Protesters had said that there was no connection between the shooting and the camp. But police on Sunday night identified the slain man as 25-year-old Kayode Ola Foster of Oakland, saying his family confirmed he had been staying at the plaza. Police officer Johnna Watson said witnesses have told police that one of two suspects in the shooting had also been a frequent resident at the plaza. The suspects' names haven't been released. Investigators suspect that the shooting resulted from a fight between two groups of men. In the hours after the midnight Saturday eviction deadline in Portland, the anti-Wall Street protesters and their supporters had flooded the park area. Empty: The remnants of Occupy Oakland's encampment at Frank H. Ogawa after authorities evicted its occupants this morning in a pre-dawn raid . Plastic cuffs: Only 20 people were arrested during the raid, compared to Occupy Portland's 50 after a weeks-long source of tension for the west coast US city . Security: An Alameda County Sheriff stands guard over Frank Ogawa Plaza after riot-clad law enforcement officers cleared the protestors out this morning . At one point, the crowd swelled to thousands. As dawn arrived, riot police had retreated and most of the crowds had gone home, but protesters who have been at the two parks since October 6 were still there, prompting one organizer to declare the night a victory for the movement. 'We stood up to state power,' Jim Oliver said. It didn't last. Police moved in later. An officer on a loudspeaker warned that anyone who resisted risked arrest and 'may also be subject to chemical agents and impact weapons.' Demonstrators chanted 'we are a peaceful protest'. 'We were talking about what we were going to do and then they just started hitting people. Seems like a waste of resources to me,' protester Mike Swain, 27, said.One man was taken away on a stretcher; he was alert and talking to paramedics, and raised a peace sign to fellow protesters, who responded with cheers. Portland Mayor Sam Adams on Sunday defended his order to clear the park, saying it is his job to enforce the law and keep the peace. 'This is not a game,' he said. Occupied no more: A police officer walks through the empty encampment after hundreds were evicted this morning due to last week's shooting . Not over: Police plan on clearing out most of the Occupy encampments across the U.S. though protestors vow to return . Officials said that one officer suffered minor injuries. Police had prepared for a possible clash, warning that dozens of anarchists may be planning a confrontation with authorities. But all was not so peaceful in other occupy Wall Streets across the U.S. In Salt Lake City, police arrested 19 people on Saturday when protesters refused to leave a park a day after a man as found dead inside his tent at the encampment. In Albany, N.Y., police arrested 24 Occupy Albany protesters after they defied an 11pm curfew in a state-owned park. In Denver, authorities arrested four people as they forced protesters to leave a downtown encampment. In San Francisco, police said two demonstrators attacked two police officers in separate incidents during a march, leaving them with minor injuries. The assailants couldn't be located.","Only 20 arrests made .

"By . Rob King . UPDATED: . 04:53 EST, 6 March 2012 . One hundred million years of life will be lost in the UK unless smokers give up their habit, experts are warning. On the 50th anniversary of its first report on smoking and health, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) says more than a fifth of the population still smokes. With smokers losing an average of 10 years of life each, a hundred million years of life will be lost, it says. The body believes the cost of tobacco should be raised, claiming that cigarettes are 50 per cent more affordable now than they were in 1965, despite being heavily taxed. But calls for more legislation have been criticised by a smokers' group, who say  smokers are 'treated like lepers and vilified' for their habit. Audrey Hepburn (right) lights up in Breakfast at Tiffany's, watched by George Peppard (left) and Martin Balsam (centre). The Royal College of Physicians wants 'unnecessary' brand images for tobacco removed from films and TV programmes . Half of people who smoke are known to die from their habit. The RCP published its first report on the issue in 1962 and has updated its findings for a one-day conference today. More than six million people have died as a result of smoking since 1962 but at least 360,000 deaths have also been prevented owing to there being fewer smokers overall. The RCP will today discuss ways to cut the number of smokers further, such as making cigarettes more expensive. Real prices are undercut by discounting, small pack sizes and illegal supplies, it says. The RCP wants 'unnecessary' brand images for tobacco removed from films and TV programmes watched by children and young people, and supports a move towards plain packaging for tobacco. Furthermore, it wants the smoking ban extended to parks and other public areas, while saying children should be legally protected from smoke in cars and homes, and there should be mass media campaigns on the dangers of smoking. Nine out of 10 smokers do not use the NHS to help them quit so the RCP wants to reach those people with better services. Chair of the RCP tobacco advisory group, Professor John Britton, said: 'Smoking is still the biggest avoidable killer in the UK. 'Smokers smoke because of an addiction to nicotine that is usually established before adulthood. 'There is so much more that can and should be done to prevent the death, disease and human misery that smoking causes. 'Our Government needs to act at the highest level to tackle smoking head on, and eradicate it from our society and particularly our children's futures.' RCP president Sir Richard Thompson said: 'This important conference marks another milestone in the RCP's efforts to reduce unnecessary deaths and disease from smoking. 'I hope that in another 50 years smoking, like slavery, will have passed into history.' On the day the report was published Health Secretary Andrew Lansley told ITV Daybreak that there needed to be continued pressure to reduce the number of smokers. Andrew Lansley said there needed to be continued pressure to reduce the number of smokers . 'There . are still about eight million people in this country who smoke, it is . still the largest avoidable cause of death,' he said. 'Fifty . years after the smoking and health report, I will be joining the RCP . today again and we will be making clear that we need to continue the . pressure to reduce the number of smokers. 'It is actually often about ensuring that we help those who want to give up smoking.' A campaign showing the damaging effects of invisible second-hand smoke will be among a raft of measures introduced by the Government to cut the number of deaths. More than 80 per cent of smoke cannot be seen but the campaign, to begin later this month, will feature TV, radio and newspaper adverts showing the fumes and how children can be exposed to them. In a speech at the Royal College of Physicians, Health Secretary Andrew Lansley will say today that the Government will not stop its battle to cut the number of smokers. Supermarkets will be forced to remove tobacco displays on April 6 and all other shops will have to end them in April 2015. The Government will begin a consultation on whether to ban logos and introduce plain packaging for tobacco in the spring. Mr Lansley said: 'There are no two ways about it - smoking kills. And our aim is simple - we must reduce rates of smoking. 'I remember when it was acceptable to . smoke anywhere, at work, on trains and in planes. 'It’s easy to forget . that wasn’t too long ago, and how far we have come. But we must do much . more. 'More than eight million people continue . to smoke despite stark data that shows it kills half of smokers and . around 90% of lung cancer deaths in the UK are caused by smoking.' Smoking on the London Underground was banned in 1984, tobacco advertising was prohibited in 2002 and smoking in pubs ended in 2007. More than 80,000 people die from smoking diseases every year. He . added: 'We will be conducting a campaign to support people realising . that second-hand smoke is not only something we need to get rid of in . public places but it is something we need not to expose other people to . in our own homes and cars as well. 'I am not proposing legislation to go into people's homes and cars and control what they do. 'But . I do hope that people will respond to that campaign because actually we . are getting a very good response to our stop smoking services. 'We have got the best stop smoking services locally in the world.' Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), said: 'There has been a seismic shift in attitudes to smoking since the early 1960s when the majority of adults smoked. 'However, one in five Britons still smokes and around 200,000 children start smoking every year. 'Although a great deal has been achieved, more still needs to be done, particularly to stop children getting hooked. 'Putting tobacco products out of sight in shops will help but we also need to stop the marketing of tobacco via the packs. 'Plain packaging of tobacco products is the logical next step to put an end to tobacco marketing and we look forward to the forthcoming Government consultation on this issue.' Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said: 'The authors of the first report on smoking and health were right to draw attention to the risks associated with smoking. 'Regrettably, since 1962 education has been replaced by coercion and smokers are now treated like lepers and vilified for their habit. 'Intolerance and scaremongering have replaced legitimate consumer information and common sense has given way to illiberal legislation designed to force people to give up a legal product. 'Adults have a right to make informed choices about smoking, eating and drinking. 'The 50th anniversary of the RCP report is an opportunity to remind politicians of their responsibilities in a liberal democratic society.'","Royal College supports plain packaging for .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 00:30 EST, 28 February 2012 . Auto sales are growing so fast that Detroit can barely keep up. Three years after the U.S. auto industry nearly collapsed, sales of cars and trucks are surging. Sales could exceed 14million this year, above last year's 12.8million. The result: Carmakers are adding shifts and hiring thousands of workers around the country. Carmakers and parts companies added more than 38,000 jobs last year, with industry employment averaging 717,000 for 2011. And automakers have announced plans to add another 13,000 this year, mostly on night shifts. Assembly line: A Ford Motor employee works on the underbody of 2012 Ford Focus vehicles at the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan on December 14, 2011 . But there's a downside. The newfound success is straining the factory network of the Detroit automakers, as well as the companies that make the thousands of parts that go into each vehicle. This could lead to shortages that drive up prices. And it also has auto executives in a quandary. They got into trouble in the first place largely because their costs were too high. Now, they fear adding too many workers. Ford, for instance, is 'squeezing every last component, transmission, engine out of the existing brick and mortar,' says Jim Tetreault, vice president of North America manufacturing. Still, the hiring surge bolsters the argument of those who supported the federal bailout of General Motors and Chrysler in 2008 and 2009. The bailout has been a major issue in the days leading up to Tuesday's Michigan Republican primary. Across the U.S.: A worker installs doors on the Chevrolet Cruze car as it moves along the assembly line at the General Motors Cruze assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio on July 22, 2011 . And the hiring is good news for communities around the country that saw hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs disappear. Starting in 2005, GM, Ford and Chrysler closed 28 factories and eliminated 88,000 jobs. Parts companies cut another 234,000. Now, if sales hit 15million by 2015, as some experts predict, the three Detroit automakers could hire another 20,000 people, predicts Sean McAlinden, chief economist for the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. '[Ford is] squeezing every last component, transmission, engine out of the existing brick and mortar.' - Jim Tetreault, Vice President, Ford North America manufacturing . 'You can only squeeze so much out of the same amount of people,' says Itay Michaeli, an auto analyst at Citi Investment Research. Laurie Schmald Moncrieff, president of a small parts-manufacturing company near Flint, Michigan, says when demand for auto parts collapsed, she shifted production to parts for companies in green energy, aerospace and defense. Now, automakers and other parts suppliers have her on speed dial, trying to line up everything from fuel pump parts to tools that make hoses. She just added six workers and may hire another five. 'I see tremendous growth coming in the near-term,' she says. Like many parts suppliers, she's having trouble finding people with the skills to run machinery in her plant. The hiring binge couldn't have happened . at a better time for Michigan. Many of the new auto jobs came around the . Great Lakes where the Detroit Three have most of their factories. Making the rounds: A Chrysler auto assembly worker walks along the final production line of the 2011 all-new Jeep Grand Cherokee at the Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit in 2010 . The bailout that helped bring the jobs could be a deciding factor in who wins the Republican presidential nomination. Both front-runners, Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney, opposed the bailout, and Tuesday's Michigan primary will show whether Romney damaged his chances in his native state. Romney stuck to his stance on Monday, . saying in an appearance on Fox News that President Obama favored the . United Auto Workers union in the bailout. The president 'was paying off . the people that supported him and that, by the way, are trying to get . him re-elected,' Romney said. '[President Obama] was paying off the people that supported him and that, by the way, are trying to get him re-elected.'- Mitt Romney on the auto industry bailout . But in a state where unemployment was above 14 per cent just three years ago, any jobs are welcome. And Michigan is not the only region to benefit. Ford is adding positions in Louisville, Kentucky, Chicago and near Kansas City, Missouri. Chrysler is adding jobs in Belvidere, Illinois, and General Motors is hiring at plants in Tennessee, Kentucky, Texas and New York. New jobs with auto companies don't pay as well as the old ones. Under union contracts, companies can pay new hires around $16 per hour, a little more than half the pay of longtime workers. Foreign carmakers are also shifting production to the U.S. because of higher sales and the weak dollar, which cuts the profits they get from selling vehicles exported to America. Nissan is adding workers in Tennessee. Toyota just hired staff at a new plant in Blue Springs, Missouri. Honda is hiring in Alabama and Ohio. Hyundai and Kia plants in Alabama and Georgia are running flat-out but can't meet demand for some models such as the Hyundai Sonata and Elantra. What this means for the GOP: The bailout could be a deciding factor in who wins the presidential nomination. Both front-runners, Rick Santorum, left, and Mitt Romney, right, opposed the bailout . The sales rebound comes with risks that are familiar to Detroit. Crank up production too much and carmakers have to sell vehicles at deep discounts. Boost production too little, and companies could run short of vehicles such as pickup trucks. And even if they find the right balance now, automakers are leery of raising long-term costs by adding plants and workers. Six years ago, Detroit's automakers were losing billions, in part because they had too many plants and workers. And union contracts forced them to pay workers even if plants were shut down. So automakers kept the factories running regardless of whether vehicles would sell in order to cover expenses. They built too many cars and trucks and sold them cheap, sometimes at a loss. Now, they're doing everything they can to keep costs under control. Growth is putting the squeeze on Hyundai and Kia factories. But the affiliated companies will build as many vehicles as possible at two U.S. plants before constructing a new factory. John Krafcik, Hyundai's U.S. CEO, says the first choice is to find areas inside the plants that are slowing the assembly lines and fix them, 'because plants are expensive.' GM also will try to handle growth by . stretching factories, says North American President Mark Reuss. But he . thinks the company will have to hire more workers if sales this year . reach 13.5million or beyond. Hardline: Romney stuck to his stance on Monday, saying in an appearance on Fox News that President Obama, pictured speaking out the White House the same day, favoured the United Auto Workers union in the bailout . Auto factories in North America will reach 90 per cent of their capacity if sales hit 14million, says Michael Robinet, managing director of IHS Automotive Consulting, which forecasts auto production. The lack of factories, though, could cause automakers to run short of pickup trucks this year, says McAlinden. Detroit automakers, which dominate truck sales, had far too many pickup factories just seven years ago. They have closed eight truck plants since 2005, removing the ability to build 2.25million pickups a year. With only nine North American pickup plants left, they may have cut too much, McAlinden says. Last year Americans bought 1.8million pickups, an 11 per cent increase over 2010, as the economy improved and small and large businesses began replacing their aging vehicles. Pent-up demand is fueling the sales. The average age of a truck on U.S. roads has reached a record 11 years. If sales increase as projected, companies also could run short of compact cars and small SUVs. It adds up to what could be a challenging but profitable year for the industry, says Schmald Moncrieff, who runs the Michigan parts factory. 'A lot of things are going to start breaking loose all at once,' she says.","Sales could exceed 14million this year, above last year's 12.8million .

Miranda Washinawatok, 12, was told off by her teacher for saying ‘I love you’ in the language used by the Menominee Tribe of Indians and was later banned from playing in the game. ‘She sort of threw her hands down on her desk and said, ""Don’t be talking like that. How would you like it if I started talking Polish?""’ Miranda told NBC26. Benched: Native American Miranda Washinawatok was suspended from playing a basketball game because of speaking in her native language . Punished: Miranda Washinawatok was suspended after saying 'I love you' in her native language . Teacher: Julie Gurta reportedly asked Miranda, 'How would you like it if I spoke Polish and you didn't understand?' The teacher, Julie Gurta, and the principal of Shawano Sacred Heart School in Wisconsin have now apologized for Miranda’s benching from the match. School Principal Dan Minter said he wasn't told the nature of the incident when he made the decision to suspend Miranda from the basketball game. University of North Dakota teams risk being banned from games if their athletes, cheerleaders or band wear or display the school's Fighting Sioux nickname and American Indian head logo. 'We ask that the university take measures to minimize or eliminate the presence of the imagery or nickname brought to an NCAA championship venue,' Bernard Franklin, an NCAA executive vice president, said in a letter. The NCAA has long said the nickname and logo are 'hostile' to American Indians, but the mention of forfeiting games is a new development. ‘We knew going in that this was a possibility, but it's in black and white now,’ Brian Faison, the university's athletic director, said. In March 2011, the North Dakota Legislature approved a law that required the university to use the logo and the Fighting Sioux nickname. Miranda’s mother, Tanaes, has described the treatment as ‘unfair’ and is lobbying for Julie Gurta to be fired from her post. 'It was unfair treatment I thought,' Tanaes told NBC26. 'It could have been handled differently.' Tanaes said the school has a majority of Native American children attending, who shouldn’t be restricted with their languages. 'I’m not going to let anybody tell me they can’t speak that language,' said Tanaes. The Catholic diocese of Green Bay also issued an apology to the entire Menominee nation on Tuesday. 'It is our hope that with greater awareness, we can begin to repair any harm that has been caused, and be able to build new and improved relationships,' said Joseph Bound, director of education for the diocese. Bound's letter states the diocese recognizes a need for cultural diversity training for students, staff and families at Sacred Heart and plans to create a partnership with Menominee tribal members to implement cultural training at the school in the coming months. The diocese also plans to invite other cultural groups, including the Menominee, to bring ideas to create cultural awareness and sensitivity to all Catholic schools in the diocese.

"By . Beth Stebner . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 6 March 2012 . A new study shows that minorities are given far less opportunity than their white peers, are taught by less experienced teachers, and made up the majority of students arrested. According to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, black students – especially males - are three and a half times as likely to be suspended or expelled, according to the report. More than 70 per cent of students involved in school-related arrests or cases referred to law enforcement were Hispanic or African-American. Subject to discipline: An education report says that minorities are much more likely to receive harsh discipline and get expelled . The findings come from a national collection of civil rights data from 2009-2010 of more than 72,000 schools serving 85 per cent of the nation. 'The sad fact is that minority students across America face much harsher discipline than non-minorities, even within the same school,' Education Secretary Arne Duncan told reporters. Mr Duncan said some school officials might not have been aware of inconsistencies in how they handle discipline, and he hoped the report would be an eye-opener. According to the report, 42 per cent of . the referrals to law enforcement involve black students and 29 per cent . involved Hispanics. Disparate discipline: According to the study, black students represent 18 per cent of students in the sample, but 35 per cent of students suspended once and 39 per cent of those expelled . I fought the law: Over 70 per cent of students involved in school-related arrests or referred to law enforcement are Hispanic or African-American . The study shows that those who teach at schools with a majority of black and Hispanic students are paid significantly less than their colleagues. Teachers in high-minority schools are paid on average $2,251 less per annum, and were found to be less experienced as well. However, in big cities like New York and Philadelphia, the discrepancy rose from $8,000 to more than $14,000. Meanwhile, 35 per cent of students involved in school-related arrests were black and 37 per cent were Hispanic. Black students made up 18 per cent of the students in the sample, but they were 35 per cent of students suspended once and 39 per cent of students expelled in total, the report said. Civil rights education data was collected as early as 1968, but was halted in 2006 by the second bush administration, the New York Times reported. The data has since been collected again, and serves as a window into how minorities are routinely discriminated against, especially those with disabilities, who are subjected at an alarmingly high number to restrains, seclusion, and even arrests. Though they only comprised 12 per cent of the student body, a staggering 70 per cent of students with disabilities were subject to physical restraints.","Study by DOE's Office for Civil Rights shows 70 per cent of students involved in arrests were Hispanic or African-American .

Health secretary Andrew Lansley was heckled by a group of protesters about his proposed Health and Social Care Bill while waking down a hospital corridor yesterday. He was on a private, unscheduled visit to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, North London when he was accosted by some fiery campaigners. It is understood Mr Lansley was using the hospital to shoot an interview for an announcement about the health service, but the group caught up with him as he was making his way through the building. Unaware: Mr Lansley (right in blue tie) was on a private, unscheduled visit to the Royal Free Hospital yesterday in Hampstead, North London when angry campaigners caught up with him . Clash: Police, security guards and hospital managers threw a cordon round the beleaguered minister as he was chased down the corridor with the retired GP shouting after him . In the 48 second video, the voice of Dr Ron Singer, president of the Medical Practitioners Union and member of the GPC can be heard shouting his health bill concerns. ‘I . am a doctor of 30 years Mr Lansley, explain to me how this is going to . make patients better because nobody understands your Bill.' 'It has got 1,000 amendments because it was so poorly drafted,' the retired GP shouted. 'And . now people are making amendments today because the Bill is rubbish and . you know it and you have given Mr Cameron one big headache,' he added. The . GP was also joined by protestor June Hautot, bearing a sign reading . 'Stop the Codswallop' - she hit the headlines last month when she . angrily confronted Mr Lansley as he arrived for a cabinet meeting. She had wagged her finger at the stunned Health Secretary, accusing of talking 'codswallop.' Eventually police, security guards . and hospital managers threw a cordon round the beleaguered minister and . ushered him onto a cardiac ward and locked the doors. In the manic scramble to get the Health Secretary away, he was . ushered him onto a cardiac ward by hospital officials who quickly locked the doors . Meet again: Pensioner June Hautot, who made headlines when she confronted Mr Lansley last month in Whitehall was also in the group - the sign read: 'Stop the Codswallop' Strong message: June Hautot, was outside the Royal Free NHS Hospital in Hampstead bearing a sign reading 'Stop the Codswallop! Lansley leave our NHS alone' Speaking about the video posted online, Dr Singer says he was forced to pursue Mr Lansley after he failed to respond to requests from campaigners to talk by ‘pushing past' them and ignoring their concerns. Dr Singer said Mr Lansley's team had smuggled him into the hospital via a back entrance to avoid campaigners. ‘When Mr Lansley came out of the room we all asked to speak with him but he just pushed past us, surrounded by police and security, into the next venue. I was so angry and frustrated that when he came out the next time I felt the need to shout my concerns,' Dr Singer said to the GP website, Pulse. ‘He didn't look to the left or right. He just had a fixed face on and just totally and utterly ignored us, which is I think disrespectful and that's why I started explaining that I'm a doctor of 30 years. But he will only talk to people who will given him the message that support his views.' Dr Singer added: ‘I think he shows a level of arrogance at an organisation level and a personal level that is shameful. I think he looks in the mirror and sees a genius whereas everyone else sees an incompetent health secretary.' We meet again: Last month June Hautot wagged her finger at the stunned Health Secretary, accusing of talking 'codswallop' as he arrived at a meeting on the future of the NHS . Andrew Lansley has defended the NHS reforms, saying 'at the heart of the bill has been achieving better quality for patients by empowering doctors and patients on the front line.' The bill aims to give GPs control of much of the NHS budget and would open up the health service to greater competition from the private and voluntary sector. But opponents say this will mean 'privatisation' of much of the service. Dubbed one of the most radical plans in the history of the NHS, the bill has proved controversial. Under the latest concessions, large increases in private work by NHS hospitals will require the approval of governing bodies. Amid hostility from a large number of professional bodies representing . doctors, nurses and other health workers, unions plan to stage a mass . protest outside Parliament. Last week a GP commissioning group came . out publicly against the reforms, warning they were getting in the way . of their work and were not needed to improve services to patients. Liberal Democrat activists are attempting to hold a vote on axing the bill, at the party's spring conference this weekend. The bill, which is opposed by Labour,  is currently being debated in the Lords. A Department of Health spokesperson . said: ‘The NHS is a matter for passionate debate. Ministers are used to . meeting protesters on their travels and take that in their stride.","Retired GP shouted at him 'the Bill is rubbish and you know it and you have given Mr Cameron one big headache'

Behind bars: PIP boss Jean-Claude Mas has been jailed while he awaits trial over the breast implant scandal after failing to pay his £83,000 bail (file picture) The former multi-millionaire businessman at the centre of a worldwide breast implant health scare was behind bars today after failing to pay his bail money. Jean-Claude Mas, 72, is facing a range of charges in his native France relating to the collapse of his Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) business. Thousands of women, including many in Britain, want to sue him after the implants were found to have been filled with industrial silicon and were linked with a range of illnesses. Mas was arrested earlier this year, but released from police custody on January 27 on bail of 100,000 euros (£83,000). But after he failed to pay all of the bail money, police revisited him on Monday and took him to Baumettes prison in Marseilles. He will remain there indefinitely until his trial for causing 'involuntary injuries', and also faces a charge of 'causing bodily harm'. The French authorities took all the implants off the market in March 2010 because of concerns about the way they leaked so easily. Last December, health officials in Paris recommended that all the implants should be surgically removed. British health secretary Andrew Lansley has also ordered a review of the possible dangers, urging concerned women to visit their GPs. Detained: Mas in a police car outside a Marseille police station after being arrested on January 26 . Accused: The 72-year-old faces trial on charges of causing 'involuntary injuries' and bodily harm' after his cut-price implants were linked to various illnesses . Mas has, meanwhile, accused women who are trying to sue him of doing so solely 'for the money'. He insists that there was nothing wrong with the cut-price implants which, at the height of his career as a medical supplies businessman, made him a millionaire many times over. Mas has since claimed that all the money has gone, although investigators believe that much of his fortune was simply passed on to Dominique Lucciardi, his former girlfriend, and their two grown-up children. Cheap: Thousands of women, including many in Britain, want to sue Mas over the implants, which contained a substandard gel that enabled him to save the company about £1million a year . Mas, a former travelling salesman who started out selling meat and wine, founded PIP in 1991 to take advantage of the booming market for cheap cosmetic implants. Using a substandard gel enabled him to save the company about £1million a year and still increase sales. A French police spokesman said: 'We can confirm that Mr Mas was arrested for not meeting his bail conditions. He is currently being held in prison in Marseilles.'","Jean-Claude Mas couldn't stump up £83,000 bond ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:52 EST, 7 March 2012 . The world's most notorious computer hacker turned against his comrades because he did not want to go to prison and leave behind his two children, it has been revealed. Top members of hacking groups Anonymous and LulzSec have been arrested across two continents after their leader, 28-year-old Hector Xavier Monsegur, turned them in. In a startling show of betrayal towards his fellow hackers, the father-of-two spent the last six months working as an FBI informant, leading authorities to the five people who have now been charged in court papers in New York. Monsegur, who has been described as the ringleader of LulzSec, and an 'influential member' of Anonymous, pleaded guilty to a dozen hacking-related charges last summer - crimes which carry a maximum sentence of 124 years and six months in prison. But, rather than face a lengthy jail sentence and not see his two children, the unemployed father agreed to cooperate with the FBI, and, ever since his arrest, has reportedly been working with them to bring down the groups' top hackers. Betrayal: The leader of hacking group LulzSec has been identified as Hector Xavier Monsegur. Since his arrest last June, he has reportedly been working with the FBI to identify other members . The suspects include four LulzSec members - two men from Great Britain and two from Ireland - and one member of Anonymous - an American named Jeremy Hammond from . Chicago. 'This is devastating to the organization,' an FBI official told Fox News. 'We’re chopping off the head of LulzSec.' The hackers have claimed to be . responsible for a number of attacks on large companies, law enforcement . and government agencies, including the CIA, FBI and Sony. They are believed to have caused billions of dollars in damages to corporations, banks and agencies. Fox News reported that FBI agents broke down Monsegur, who works under the alias of Sabu, by using his children against him. ‘It was because of his kids,’ one of the . two arresting agents told the news channel. ‘He’d do anything for his kids. He . didn’t want to go away to prison and leave them. That’s how we got him.’ Monsegur had been living in New York's Lower East Side when he was seized by authorities because of his own carelessness. They found his address after he logged into a chatroom without masking his IP - the address which shows a user's whereabouts. Authorities launched surveillance and watched him for weeks - but were forced to move when a rival hacker revealed Monsegur's identity online. Caught: The information he provided reportedly led to charges for five top members across two continents. Four worked for LulzSec and one for Anonymous, whose supporters wear Guy Fawkes masks, as pictured . The hacker group led by Hector Xavier Monsegur is believed to have caused billions of dollars in damages to corporations, banks and agencies . Anonymous is the umbrella term used to represent an internet subculture – a collection of online individuals, or 'hacktivists', who share common ideas of anti-censorship and freedom of speech on the internet. They have carried out cyber attacks on Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Amazon, and have threatened to take down Facebook and Twitter servers. Although it is not formerly . affiliated with it, the group has connections with the lesser-known . hacking group LulzSec. LulzSec, short for Lulz Security, is an offshoot of Anonymous and some members have been parts of both collectives . LulzSec is an elite . computer hacker group that has claimed responsibility for several . high-profile, debilitating cyber attacks. Their big hits include the compromising of user account data from Sony Pictures and taking the CIA website offline. They also attacked Fox.com, leaking . the names of more than 7,000 X Factor contestants, and the PBS Newshour . website, where they posted a story claiming that slain killer Tupac was . still living and in New Zealand. The group aims to cause mayhem as well as manipulate flaws in security and passwords systems. Fearing he would destroy his hard . drives - and thus evidence needed to prove his guilt - they went to . arrest him in June last year. Monsegur initially tried to deny he was the man the FBI were after. ‘It’s not me, you got the wrong guy,’ he allegedly said, according to sources who witnessed the interaction. ‘I don’t have a computer.’ At this point, one of the FBI agents . threatened to have the father locked up, which is when he caved in and . agreed to cooperate with them. He pleaded guilty to 12 counts of hacking . charges on August 15 but went on living in the Manhattan unit he shared with his children, supporting them and five brothers and a sister. His records were unsealed today, charging him with conspiracy to engage in computer hacking, among other charges. The 27-page indictment describes him as an . 'influential member of three hacking organizations — Anonymous, Internet . Feds and Lulz Security — that were responsible for multiple cyber . attacks on the computer systems of various businesses and governments in . the United States and throughout the world'. They claim he acted as a 'rooter', a computer hacker who identified vulnerabilities in computer systems. As part of Anonymous, court . papers claim he took part cyber attacks from December 2010 until last . June, including attacks on Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, and further . attacks on government computers in Tunisia, Algeria, Yemen and . Zimbabwe. As part of Internet Feds, he is alleged to have participated in attacks against businesses including HBGary Inc., a private security firm and Fox Broadcasting Co. And he is accused of forming LulzSec last May with other hackers, who then attacked Sony, PBS and the United States Senate, among others. Monsegur was free on $50,000 bail. Also charged in court papers with . conspiracy to commit computer hacking were Ryan Ackroyd and Jake Davis . from Great Britain, Darren Martyn and Donncha O’Cearrbhail of . Ireland, and an American named Jeremy Hammond from Chicago. Davis, who already faces a number of charges in the UK relating to alleged hacking by LulzSec, and Ackroyd, 23, were charged with two counts of computer hacking conspiracy. Each count of computer hacking conspiracy carries a sentence of up to 10 years in jail. It is understood that Scotland Yard is also running parallel inquiries into Ackroyd and Davis’ alleged activities within LulzSec. It has been reported that it is unlikely anyone would be extradited before the UK trials had concluded. Another English teenager Ryan Cleary, . was arrested by British law enforcement in June last year and was charged with being . linked to the group. Questions: Jerermy Hammond from Chicgo, Illinois (left in 2009) and Donncha O’Cearrbhail of Ireland (right) Charges: Sources named Jake Davis (left), from the United Kingdom, as one of the hackers facing charges. English teenager Ryan Cleary, (right) already faces hacking charges, allegedly as part of LulzSec . The arrested member of Anonymous, Jeremy Hammond from Chicago, has been charged with one count of computer hacking conspiracy, one count . of computer hacking, and one count of conspiracy to commit access device . fraud. He . reportedly caused the hacking of Stratfor Security Intelligence, which . led to the leak of 200GB worth of emails then published on Wikileaks. Fox sources said Hammond will be charged in a separate indictment. Darren Martyn, 25, of Galway, Ireland, has been charged with two counts of computer hacking conspiracy, while Donncha O'Cearrbhail, 19, of Birr, Ireland, has been charged with one count of computer hacking conspiracy and one charge of unlawfully intercepted wire communication, which carries a sentence of up to five years. The charge sheets detail how central Monsegur was in building the FBI's case against those arrested. According to the indictment written by the investigating FBI officer, 'CW' or Sabu, communicated with other hackers 'acting under the direction of the FBI'. From information taken from internet chat logs 'recorded by the FBI with the CW's consent', one document relating to O’Cearrbhail reveals how he recorded a conference call between the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency and the FBI. The file was received by Monsegur and verified by the FBI. The FBI was then able to refer to another conversation between the pair where O’Cearrbhail, who was writing under several names, revealed his identity. O’Cearrbhail faces up to 15 years in prison if he is extradited and convicted. Fox claims Monsegur has been feeding authorities information about LulzSec ever since his arrest, bringing them down from the . inside. Yet he has continued to be a public face . for the movement, tweeting to his followers on Monday: 'The federal . government is run by a bunch of f****** cowards. Don't give in to these . people. Fight back. Stay strong.' In August, 2011, it came to light . that Anonymous had hacked into 70 law enforcement websites, mostly local . sheriffs’ websites in Missouri. The hacks had occurred four weeks . before they were discovered. Using information passed on by Monsegur, the FBI . was able to work with the server company to mitigate the damage, Fox . claims. Mass damage: The hacking group Anonymous, whose logo is pictured, is . believed to have caused billions of dollars in damages to corporations, . banks and government agencies . The FBI then alerted 300 government, . financial and corporate entities around the world to potential . vulnerabilities in their computer systems. Stories . have also emerged about Sabu's far-reaching power. When the CIA found . itself under siege from LulzSec hackers, Sabu, working for the . government, told them to stop, and they did. 'He's a rockstar,' a New York-based . hacker told Fox. 'All the girls, you buy them a drink, but all they want . to talk about is Sabu, Sabu, Sabu.' Barrett Brown, a former journalist . who became closely associated with Anonymous, said Sabu's betrayal would . have a serious effect on the group. 'He was an admired Anon,' he told AP. 'He's been a leader. People came to him with information. God knows what else he told them.'","Leader of computer hacking group LulzSec identified as unemployed father-of-two Hector Xavier Monsegur .

A nursing assistant has been jailed and banned from using Facebook and other social media websites after posting a dying patient's buttocks on the internet. Nai Mai Chao, 26, took graphic pictures of at least two patients using bed pans while working at the Regency Pacific Nursing and Rehab Center in Gresham, a suburb of Portland, Oregon. She then put the photographs on her Facebook page and wrote derogatory comments about them. Chao was found guilty of an invasion of personal privacy and sentenced to eight days behind bars. She was also fired from her job and had her nursing licence revoked. One of the patients was shown lying down with their buttocks exposed. Another photograph showed the back of a patient's head. The rest of the pictures, which were taken in April last year, showed the contents of bed pans, a two-day trial heard. Kelley Cloyd, a prosecutor assigned to the Multnomah County's Gresham office, said: 'It's a good lesson that we need to be responsible about things we are posting online.' After Chao posted the photographs on her Facebook wall, her friends either made fun of them or added comments showing their disgust. She denied taking the photographs but admitted putting them on the website. A jury took only half an hour to find her guilty. Chao was arrested last September after a co-worker recognised a patient from their bandages in a photograph and reported the matter to a supervisor. Chao surrendered her nursing certificate in January and was fired from her job. She was sentenced at the end of last month and released from prison on Friday. In addition to the jail sentence, Chao was ordered to avoid all social media sites, including Facebook, Google+, Twitter and MySpace. She was also ordered to write a 1,000-word apology to a patient that 'should be an insightful look at why the defendant did what she did'. Sacked: Chao was fired from her job at the Regency Pacific Nursing and Rehab Center in Gresham, a suburb of Portland, Oregon. If the letter fails to meet that standard, a judge ruled, she could be charged with violating her two-year probation. But the patient will never read the letter - he died two months after the incident . Chao . was also banned from taking pictures of anyone without their 'explicit consent' and forbidden from working with children or the elderly for two years. Her name was entered into a national database that prohibits her from obtaining a nursing licence anywhere else in the U.S. The former nursing assistant, who has no fixed address according to court documents, has not commented on the case.","Nai Mai Chao took graphic photographs of elderly and disabled patients using bed pans .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . UPDATED: . 22:59 EST, 7 March 2012 . An Australian investment banker has admitted chaining a fake bomb to a young woman's neck in a terrifying attempt to extort money. Madeleine Pulver was studying alone at her . family's mansion in a wealthy Sydney suburb when Paul Douglas Peters broke in wearing a . ski mask and wielding a baseball bat. He tethered a bomb-like device around the 18-year-old's neck and left a note at the scene demanding money before fleeing. Guilty: Paul Douglas Peters - pictured left as he is escorted from a courthouse at an earlier hearing in the U.S. - admitted the extortion attempt . It took bomb squad experts more than 10 hours to remove the device but no explosives were found and Miss Pulver was unharmed. Through his lawyer in Sydney courtroom, Peters today pleaded guilty to a charge of aggravated break and enter and committing a serious indictable offence by knowingly detaining the teenager. The court heard that the note Peters left during the incident on August  last year contained an email address, as well as a demand for money. New South Wales state police revealed that surveillance footage showed Peters in several locations where they believe he accessed the email account. Peters, who traveled frequently between the United States and Australia on business, fled to the U.S. and was arrested at his former wife's home in Louisville, Kentucky, almost two weeks after the crime. He was extradited in September to Australia, where he has remained in custody. Victim: Madeleine Pulver graduated from high school since the attack . Peters appeared in court by video from prison Thursday. He showed no reaction when his lawyer Kathy Crittenden entered the guilty plea. She said after the court appearance: 'Mr Peters deeply regrets and is profoundly sorry for the impact that this incident has had on Ms Pulver and her family.' Ms Crittenden declined to comment further. Why Peters targeted Miss Pulver is unclear. U.S. federal court documents show Peters once worked for a company with links to her family, but the Pulvers have repeatedly said they don't know him. Miss Pulver, who has graduated from high school since the attack, and her parents were in court to hear the plea. Her father, Bill, thanked police, prosecutors and members of the public for their support, and said the attack remains as mysterious and as 'random to us in our minds as it did back on August 3'. Mr Pulver added: 'There was no - nothing other than just the fact of Maddie was in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'A poor decision by one man has prompted a truly extraordinary and inspiring response from many thousands of people and we will be forever grateful.' Mr Pulver was once the president and CEO of NetRankings, a pioneer in tracking online exposure and readership for companies advertising on the Internet. He left after the firm was sold to ratings giant Nielsen in 2007. He is now CEO of Appen Butler Hill, a company that provides language and voice-recognition software and services. Peters will next appear in court on March 16 for a pre-sentencing hearing. He faces a potential maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.","Paul Douglas Peters broke into Sydney mansion wearing ski mask and wielding a baseball bat .

The goods most likely to be shoplifted have been revealed as choice cuts of meat, expensive bottles of alcohol and hi-tech items such as electric toothbrushes and smartphones. Razor blades - in particular, the high-priced Gillette Mach 4 - and deodorants are also high on the list of most at-risk products, researchers claim. Targets: Razor blades and Axe brand deodorants are high on the list of most stolen products (picture posed by model) Unsurprisingly, designer clothing and expensive fragrances are regularly targeted by thieves too, according to AdWeek.com. Perhaps more left-field is America's eighth most-shoplifted item of 2011 - the musical Muppets toy Let's Rock Elmo. One in every 11 people to walk into a shop will leave the store with at least one item that wasn't paid for, figures released by the U.S. National Association of Shoplifting Prevention reveal. This represents 1.45 per cent of total sales, meaning U.S. retailers are likely to lose a staggering $119billion (£76billion) to shoplifters this year. Shoplifting has increased by six per cent in the U.S. compared with last year, a rise blamed on the economic downturn. Only three per cent of thefts from stores are committed by professionals, with the vast majority carried out by opportunists. Barbara Staib, spokesperson for the National Association of Shoplifting Prevention, said: 'Seventy per cent of shoplifters tell us they didn't plan to shoplift.' However, more than a third - 35 per cent - of thefts are undertaken with the help of a corrupt employee. Musical Muppet: The popular Let's Rock Elmo toy is the eighth most shoplifted product in the U.S. Scent on the run: Perfumes including Chanel No 5 are popular items to pilfer . The public image of shoplifting as a crime committed by bored teenagers is also incorrect as most thefts are committed by adults in employment. Johnny Custer, from research firm Merchant Analytic Solutions, said: 'Most shoplifters simply succumb to temptation. 'But add a sense of desperation because of the economy and holiday pressures, and you have the recipe for theft soup. 'People won't be able to provide the same kind of Christmas they’re accustomed to,' he added. 'They can't afford the hot toy.'","Meat, alcohol and musical Elmo are among most stolen items .

However the group's executive director Charles Kernaghan later spoke out to say the allegations could not be proved, that he had been speaking about conditions in the country in general, and that his words had been twisted. He did speak out again last night to say: 'If Ms. Kardashian has found a way to overcome the iron-fisted repression under which the Chinese workers are forced to toil, then that would be huge news and worthy of tremendous applause. 'But unfortunately, based on our concrete experiences investigating factories in China and elsewhere, the chances are about one in a million that Ms. Kardashian has found a way to push back against the Chinese authorities and guarantee that her employees will be afforded their most basic, internationally recognized workers' rights.'

A confident Mitt Romney has said he feels 'pretty darn good' about his six wins on Super Tuesday, dismissing the narrowness of his Ohio victory over Rick Santorum by insisting he would be the Republican nominee. Appearing on CNBC the morning after he increased his delegate lead and won states from Alaska to Massachusetts with Idaho, Ohio, Virginia and Vermont in between he said he was 'getting the kind of support across the party that I need to become the nominee'. Santorum won North Dakota, Oklahoma and Tennessee while Newt Gingrich claimed his home state of Georgia but the Romney campaign said that it was a virtual impossibility either could win. On the way: Mitt Romney, who claimed at least 212 delegates on Super Tuesday, believes that he is well on his way to becoming the Republican nominee for president . 'All we have to do is keep doing what . we're doing and we can get to the nomination,' a senior Romney adviser . said. 'Those guys, it's going to take some sort of act of God to get . where they need to be to win the nomination.' As if to confirm that President Barack . Obama believes Romney will be his opponent in November, the Obama . campaign held a press conference call slamming the former Massachusetts . governor. David Axelrod, Obama's top strategist . said that Romney 'grinds out tactical victories in a kind of death . march' and added: 'We tried to appeal to the best of people, and they . appear to be trying to appeal to the worst in people' Though critics argue that he is having . trouble 'sealing the deal' with voters, Romney advisers argue that the . rules for apportionment of delegates make it certain that he will be the . nominee . Romney said: “We will come together . because Barack Obama has organised a conservative community…the . community organiser has organised us in a big way . 'When we have a nominee we will come together because Barack Obama has organized the conservative community. 'We're going to come together because we really believe that he needs to be replaced.' As well as winning more states and . securing more votes, Romney also amassed a clear majority of the more . than 400 delegates at stake. But proportional Republican rules meant he . was several hundred away from the 1,144 needed for the GOP nomination. In the bag? Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann greet supporters as they arrive at their Super Tuesday primary rally in Boston tonight . He now leads the field with 415 delegates with Santorum on 176, Gingrich on 105 and Ron Paul on 47. Romney's His wafer-thin margin of . victory in Ohio underlined doubts about his candidacy and his ability to . connect with low-income voters. Santorum's wins in North Dakota, . Oklahoma and Tennessee gave his shoestring campaign a boost but his poor . campaign organisation was revealed in his failure to secure more . delegates. Kansas is set to vote on Saturday . followed by two Southern states Alabama and Mississippi, where . evangelicals are suspicious of Romney because of his Mormon faith. Santorum is expected to do well in all three contests. Gingrich's win in Georgia was a lone . bright spot in a dismal night for him. He vowed to continue but will . face pressure to drop out so that Santorum can consolidate the . conservative anti-Romney vote, especially if victory eludes him in . Alabama and Mississippi . He told supporters in Georgia: 'There . are lots of bunny rabbits to run through, I am the tortoise. I just take . one step at a time.'

He unveiled a new slogan of 'more jobs, less debt, smaller government' that was as much aimed at Obama as his Republican rivals. Party elders fear that a prolonged race would leave Romney damaged against Obama in the general election.

Most generous soldier: Marine David Hart, 23, left £100,000 to a group of 32 friends so they could enjoy the holiday of a lifetime in Las Vegas . A marine who died in Afghanistan left £100,000 to his friends to spend on a dream holiday in Las Vegas, his family revealed at his inquest today. David Hart - who died the day before his 24th birthday - left a chunk of the money from his life insurance policy to fund the trip of a lifetime. The serviceman, from 40 Commando, was blown up an IED in Sanguin, southern Afghanistan, while on foot patrol in July 2010. The coroner's court heard today that the young soldier was 'the life . and soul of any situation he was in'. The marine had stipulated that in the event he was killed in action £100,000 of his £250,000 life insurance policy should be used by his 32 friends to go to the U.S., his family confirmed in private. He also left £50,000 to a charity to help injured marines. Marine Hart's friends were inundated by dozens of Sin City hotels and casinos, who insisted on giving them VIP treatment for free, after hearing about the heroic soldier's last wish. His best friend Andy Hare said at the time of the trip: 'David had always said ""if anything happens to me I’m going to leave this money and you can go on holiday"". 'Out of ten, I would give the holiday 11. It was incredible from start to finish. Some of the lads who hadn’t been to Vegas before couldn’t believe what it was like. 'We were treated like royalty and didn’t want for anything while we were there. Thanks to Dave’s generosity we’ve all had a holiday none of us will ever forget.' Marine Hart’s friends went on that . holiday last summer, and today at his inquest one of his colleagues who saw the . explosion paid tribute to him at the inquest. Sergeant Damien O’Sullivan, 40 Commando, told York Coroner's Court: 'He was one of the most professional people I ever met. He had a bright future ahead of him. 'He was the life and soul of any situation he as in and he was loved and respected by everyone in the police mentoring group.' Trip of a lifetime: Andy Hare, pictured, plays . in the casino of the Madalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas, after his best . friend David Hart left him and a group of friends money to go on a dream . holiday . The court heard that Marine Hart, from Poppleton, York, who was part of a team training Afghan police, was on a joint foot patrol with ten British soldiers and 13 Afghan soldiers. They were going to talk to some locals when a bomb went off in a wadi, or valley, near their base. They were travelling in an 'Afghan snake', a single file line with the Afghan soldiers up ahead, the court heard. Three metal detectors were being used to clear a path away from any explosives but none were discovered - until the explosion killed Marine Hart. Sgt O'Sullivan said: 'There was nothing on that day that led us to believe that there was any particular threat. That day was no different to any other day. 'As the Afghans were moving up the hill there was an explosion that I didn’t feel was particularly loud and a large plume of dust flew in the air.' British soldiers cleared a path to Marine Hart, who had serious injuries from the waist down, and began to administer first aid. Last wish: Friends of Royal Marine David Hart raise a glass to their friend at a pool party in Las Vegas . He was taken to receive treatment at a nearby base by military vehicles but later died. Pathologist Nicholas Hunt, in a written statement, said the cause of death was 'blast injuries caused by an explosion'. Coroner Donald Coverdale said: 'Quite a number of Afghan and British soldiers walked across this spot. 'Unfortunately Marine David Hart walked across it and it was his footstep that triggered the IED (improvised explosive device).' In a narrative verdict, he ruled: 'David Hart died from injuries inflicted by an exploding IED while on active service in Afghanistan.' The coroner told Marine Hart’s family: 'You have suffered the loss of a well-loved son. He was a well-loved, well-liked and competent soldier. 'A lot has been suffered by his family but I think it is fair to say a lot has been suffered by his extended family, his colleagues in the British Army.'","Marine David Hart paid for 32 friends to go to Las Vegas .

The win came days after she had won a share of a £10,000 bonus awarded . to staff at her store in Eastwood, Nottingham. Miss Carrington said she . would hand back her share, amounting to ‘a few hundred pounds’ for her . old colleagues to share between them. She had worked at the store since leaving school and supervised 20 . staff. A former colleague at the branch said they were ‘really made up . for her’. Miss Carrington said that, ‘feeling lucky’ after winning the bonus . money, she went home and set up an online National Lottery account.

The couple feared their luck had changed on the day of the draw, when . their computer and washing machine both broke down within hours of each . other. Mr Topham was surfing the internet to look for replacement parts for the . machines when his girlfriend checked her smartphone and discovered . their numbers had come up. The winning numbers were 3, 15, 17, 28 and . 33, and the lucky star numbers were 2 and 4. The couple met three-and-a-half years ago after being introduced by a . mutual friend during a night out.

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 10:14 EST, 8 March 2012 . Jailed: Brian Harrison, 31, was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 16 years behind bars . A fisherman has been jailed for life for murdering a grandfather who died almost two years after being attacked in the street. Brian Harrison, 31, was originally jailed in 2008 for leaving Neville Dunn in a permanent semi-conscious state and requiring round-the-clock care. But the victim died 22 months after being beaten on New Year's Eve in 2007 - so Harrison was put back on trial for murder. Yesterday he was given a minimum term of 16 years behind bars, four years after the original attack in Penzance, Cornwall, by a judge sitting at Truro Crown Court. Harrison had his sentence backdated to January 1, 2008, the date he was arrested for the original attack, meaning he will serve an additional 12 years for the murder. The defendant, an amphetamine-user, carried out the attack because he wrongly believed fellow fisherman Mr Dunn, 44, had raped his girlfriend after he admitted having a one-night stand with her. Mr Dunn's family branded his killer 'disgusting' for smirking at them during the trial and treating it as a 'one big hilarious joke'. Mr Justice Burnett, sentencing Harrison, lambasted the killer for showing no remorse for the attack and for his attitude towards Mr Dunn's family in the public gallery during his week-long trial while some witnesses gave emotional evidence. Victim: Neville Dunn who died almost two years after being attacked on New Year's Eve 2007 . 'You have caused immense damage to a large number of people,' he said. 'Kirsty Dunn (Neville's daughter) says you smirked at her during this trial, as you did at times in your first trial. 'It was clear to me during the course of this trial that you were enjoying the discomfort of several of the witnesses during this trial. 'There is no remorse in this case. You told (a friend) after the attack that Neville got what he deserved. I have seen nothing that tells me you have changed this view.' He added: 'It is clear that you did not set out on the morning of December 31 2007 to injure Neville Dunn in the way which occurred. But once you started your attack it was deliberate, vicious and repeated. You had every opportunity to stop. 'This was an attack of extreme violence committed while under the influence of, at least, amphetamines.' Mr Dunn died in October 2009 - 22 months after the attack. Harrison was able to stand trial a second time because the Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996 scrapped the 'year and a day rule' which stated that an action was presumed not to have caused a person's death if more than a year and a day elapsed between it occurring and their death.","Neville Dunn, 44, was left semi-conscious and needing round-the-clock care following original attack .

Far from being enraged by the 'vile' conditions on board, the 69-year-old 'laughed and joked' with passengers in his carriage and signed dozens of autographs, it was reported. A source told the Mirror: 'It was a pretty hideous situation but Sir Paul was on fine form. 'He had a laugh and a joke as he chatted with the passengers in his cabin and he signed dozens of autographs. 'He was more than happy to muck in and try to keep everyone’s spirits up despite the vile conditions. 'He’s not prone to diva tantrums. He understands that these things can happen.' Sir Paul was just one of thousands of travellers caught up in the cross-Channel rail chaos. Eurostar passengers - including catwalk models - yesterday told of their ‘hellish’ journeys after a faulty with an overhead power cable delayed services by up to 11 hours.

Those travelling between London and Paris were worst hit, with some stranded in the Channel Tunnel without food or light. Others . said they arrived in the French capital at 1am with no hotel room, but . the only accommodation made available to them was in a stationary train. Last night Eurostar cancelled four trains and slowed the rest and today another four trains were cancelled.

I was mad, tired and . annoyed. ‘On the train . there was no electricity, no food, it was dark. I just had to sit and . wait. The staff didn’t do anything. I was supposed to be in London for . study reasons but I’m going back to Paris today because I just want to . be in my home.’ Kandy . Woodfield, who travelled on the same train to London described the . journey as ‘hellish’, adding: ‘The bar has made an absolute killing. I . think it is terrible. There are elderly people and young children on . board.’ Hundreds of . exhausted passengers were given emergency accommodation on two TGV . trains when they finally reached Paris so they could rest after missing . their connections. Laurent . Girard, who was on his way to the Alps with friends, said: ‘It’s pretty . depressing spending 10 hours on a train and then being told you can rest . in another train.

We didn’t sleep much, but others seemed to get their heads down. When staff arrived to clean the trains at around 5am we all had to get off.’ Laurent Girard, who was also on his way to the Alps with a group of friends, said: ‘It’s pretty depressing spending 10 hours on a train and then being told you can rest in another train. ‘None of us got any sleep at all – it was awful.

Instead two TGV high speed trains became temporary dormitories for the stranded. A Eurostar spokeswoman confirmed that the delays were all caused by an EDF power cable which collapsed in the snow. She said: ‘The good news is everything is running as normal this morning. We are not expecting more problems with the power cable. ‘There was quite a severe impact on train services and we were doing everything we could to keep the train moving but it wasn't something that was in our control. ‘Our trains do carry supplies for this kind of thing so they would have been given some sort of refreshment but it wasn't going to be the most comfortable journey.

A Bollywood actress is being used as a honey trap to lure English cricketers into fixing matches, according to an undercover investigation. Bookmakers on the Indian subcontinent are using elaborate methods to target the domestic county game, which is televised around the globe, amid claims it is a soft touch. llegal betting rings are prepared to offer up to £750,000 to change to outcome of games  in order to make huge sums on the results. A sting by the Sunday Times alleges that a web of match-fixers are increasingly focusing their attention on the English county game and players because ‘nobody monitors them’. Disgraced: Cricket is still trying to rebuild its reputations after the jailing of former Pakistan cricketer Mohammad Asif, centre, and former captain Salman Butt, left, former Pakistan bowler Mohammad Aamer, right . Undercover reporters videoed Delhi bookmaker Vicky Seth boasting: ‘English county cricket is a good new market. 'They are low-profile matches and nobody monitors them. That’s why good money can be made there without any hassle if we can get the players to play for us.’ The investigation found those willing to influence a match could earn tens of thousands of pounds. An official or player who could guarantee the outcome of a match could earn £750,000. A batsman could receive around £44,000 for slow scoring and bowlers might get £50,000 to concede runs. Jailed: Three Pakistani cricketers (Mohammad Aamer, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt) were jailed for offences including bowling no-balls . The International Cricket Council, which is responsible for policing the game, refused to elaborate on claims it was aware of the Bollywood actress’ approaches to players or that it had launched its own probe into the developing scandal. Colin Gibson, the ICC’s Head of Media and Communications, said: ‘We do not comment of Anti Corruption and Security Unit matters.’ A statement on the ICC’s website said: ‘Betting on cricket in the legal and illegal markets continues to grow rapidly and, with many, many millions of dollars being bet on every match, the threat of corruptors seeking to influence the game has not gone away. It is for these reasons that the ICC’s Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) continues to pursue the three objectives of investigation, education, and prevention’. A Met Police spokesman said: ‘We are not investigating this at the moment. But if the ICC were to come to us with evidence further down the line, we would consider opening an investigation, if we were the relevant force.’ This is the latest scandal to rock the already sullied reputation of cricket world-wide. Scandal: Mervyn Westfield of Essex was jailed for spot-fixing in which he agreed to concede a pre agreed number of runs . Last month, Essex cricketer Mervyn Westfield - once tipped as a future England bowler - was given a four-month prison term after admitting he had received £6,000 to concede at least 12 runs in his first over in the Natwest Pro40 game against Durham in 2009. Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria was named in court as the man who allegedly corrupted him. Although Kaneria subsequently denied that allegation. Three Pakistan internationals, former Test captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer, have also been imprisoned for match-fixing. Jailing the men at Southwark Crown Court in November, last year, the judge Mr Justice Cooke told them: ‘It is the insidious effect of your actions on professional cricket and the followers of it that make the offences so serious. The three players were jailed alongside agent Mazhar Majeed, who was caught orchestrating the scandal in an undercover sting by the News of the World. They agreed to bowl three no-balls at specified points during a Lord’s Test match last August in return for £150,000.","Bookmaker caught on camera boasting of influence and contacts able to fix games for a fee .

"By . Sean Poulter . UPDATED: . 20:57 EST, 28 December 2011 . Farmers fear that cheap eggs produced in cruel battery cages on European farms are about to flood into Britain. The cages, in which up to six hens are crammed together with no room to flap their wings, forage or scratch, are to be banned from January 1. But while British farmers have spent £400million complying with the new EU-wide law, those in 13 other countries have refused to get rid of the tiny cages. Because Brussels has not backed up the new law with fines, penalties or an export ban, there is nothing to stop farmers who flout it from selling their eggs in Britain. That means British farmers, who  have gone to great expense to meet the deadline to get rid of the cages, could  find they are undercut and even forced out of business. At the same time, British customers could end up supporting illegally produced eggs by buying from food manufacturers and restaurants who use them. The Government has tried to deal with the issue by asking supermarkets and manufacturers to sign up to a voluntary code not to use the battery cage eggs. However, EU law prevents any tougher action such as an import ban. Animal welfare campaigners and the National Farmers’ Union have condemned both the EU and Westminster authorities for failing to enforce the ban. ‘If nothing is done to stop these illegal eggs coming in to the UK  it could be seen as rewarding  producers who are still using cruel conventional battery cages,’ said Alice Clark, senior scientist from the RSPCA. ‘There is a real danger that shoppers will unwittingly buy illegal eggs, which will not even meet minimum welfare standards. Caged: British farmers, who have gone to great expense to meet the deadline to get rid of the cages, could find they are undercut and even forced out of business . Competition: Because Brussels has not backed up the new law with fines, penalties or an export ban, there is nothing to stop farmers who flout it from selling their eggs in Britain . ‘It will be particularly difficult to trace illegal eggs when they’ve  been used as ingredients in foods such as ready meals, sandwiches, cakes and Yorkshire puddings, where they don’t have to be  labelled with production system or country of origin.’ NFU poultry board chairman Charles Bourns said British farmers were ‘bitterly disappointed’ that the sale and import of battery cage eggs had not been banned. He said: ‘We are concerned that although the Government has repeatedly pledged its support  for the industry, it cannot  prohibit the use of illegal egg  products and food manufactured from such products.’ Farming minister Jim Paice said: ‘It is unacceptable that after  the ban on battery cages comes into effect, around 50million hens across Europe will still remain  in poor conditions. It would  be unthinkable if countries continuing to house hens in poor  conditions were to profit from flouting the law.’ While the new regime outlaws the smallest battery cages, this is not the end of hens being locked in together.

Fred and Terresa Teutenberg died, but her oldest child, Ashlei Bruewer, 16, was not on the plane because she was too ill to fly at the time. The Teutenbergs: Fred and Teressa are pictured in this family photo with their children Emma, Peyton, Ellie, Brendon and Will.

Millions of public sector workers are already allowed to take more time off if they become unwell on holiday . Millions of public sector workers are already allowed to take more time off  if they become unwell on holiday – a privilege that is currently denied to workers in the private sector. An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has revealed that the entitlement is written into employee contracts in the civil service, NHS trusts and local authorities. These staff can call in from annual leave, tell their boss that they are sick and claim more holiday to make up the lost time. The right is set to be incorporated into . British law for all employees later in the year after a ruling by a . European court, though Business Secretary Vince Cable last week said he . will do all he can to resist the move. Documents . uncovered by the investigation show that the entitlement, which  has . been described by employment  lawyers as a potential ‘malingerers’ charter’, is commonly written into public sector staff agreements. When contacted by The Mail  on Sunday, public bodies were unable to say how many extra days off had been taken under the rule, claiming that the information was not recorded. Instructions issued by the organisation . of local government employers say workers who are sick while on holiday . have the right ‘to take that annual leave at another time when they are . well, even .  .  . in the next leave year’. Opposed: Vince Cable is fighting the EU ruling but it already applies to his own department . The instructions also say that staff who are off work due to illness can go on holiday while they are still signed off, otherwise employers are ‘at risk of unlawfully discriminating against workers’. Town hall workers who fall ill on holiday can obtain the time back by filling in a self-certification form. They are obliged to produce a doctor’s certificate only if their illness lasts longer than seven days, according to the Local Government Association. However, some health authorities say their staff need to produce a medical certificate to back up a claim. A Cabinet Office spokesman said of civil service employees: ‘The rule certainly applies across Whitehall but we don’t know the extent of it.’ Private sector staff are treated differently because the European court ruling that gave rise to the benefit is not yet incorporated into UK law. Organisations in the state  sector, however, have already changed their employment practices to reflect the judgment, which was handed down by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2009. A worker in Spain, Vicente Pereda, sued his firm after he was refused permission to change his holiday when he fell ill just before the start. Mr Pereda was ill for all but two days of his fortnight off. The ECJ ruled in his favour. The EU directive which followed the ruling was immediately legally binding on public bodies. Ministers say an EU deadline obliges them to introduce the new regime to all workers from October. But Mr Cable, whose own civil servants can claim the benefit, last week said he would resist any attempt to incorporate it into UK law. Employment experts say they have recently started receiving more inquiries from private  sector firms about how the rule should be applied, suggesting that workers are becoming increasingly aware of its existence. Taxpayers’ Alliance chief executive Matthew Elliott said: ‘Taxpayers will be fuming if civil servants get extra days off. Most people don’t expect an extra day off if they fall ill at weekends. A holiday should not be any different.’ A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘Civil servants must comply with strict rules on reporting sickness absence and providing medical evidence. They cannot retrospectively ask for annual leave to be treated as sickness absence.’",The right is to be incorporated into British law for all employees later in the year .
"By . Laura Cox . UPDATED: . 02:08 EST, 7 March 2012 . A man has been arrested after a homemade cannon blasted through his mobile home, killing his wife, authorities said. Richard Fox, 39, who is known to friends as Ricky, shot the cannon after loading it with fireworks powder. His 38-year-old wife, named by U-T San Diego as Jeanette Ogara Fox was found dead from shrapnel wounds when authorities arrived at the home in the small mountain community of Potrero on the Mexican border. Scene: Jeanette Ogara Fox was killed when her husband shot a makeshift cannonball into the side of the couple's mobile home . Moments after the cannon went off he phoned his brother Jerry and said: 'I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it should have been me,' according to U-T San Diego. Fox was treated at a hospital for shrapnel wounds to his right leg and arrested for investigation of exploding a device resulting in death. Three other adults and the couple's 4-year-old daughter, Vanessa, were also inside the home but escaped injury.  The girl was being looked after by her uncle, Jerry, following the explosion. Preliminary evidence suggested Fox was under the influence of alcohol, San Diego County sheriff's Sgt. David Martinez said. Investigators are yet to establish a motive or determine if the blast was accidental. Fox and his friend were supposedly working on the cannon nearby when it went off, and at least one of the men was at the scene when police arrived. A place called Potrero: 38-year-old Jeanette died in her mobile home parked in the Potrero mountain community on the Mexican border . He said that he made the cannonball, and even admitted to lighting the weapon just before it went off around 12.15am. John Arnold, a neighbor, told U-T San Diego that Fox worked as a handyman and lived in the home for about six years. 'He liked experimenting with guns, and it looks like this experiment went bad,' he told the newspaper. he added that Fox 'adores Jeanette and Vanessa. They mean the world to him. I can’t imagine how he feels right now. He probably doesn’t want to live.' The couple are apparently well known in the community, largely because of Fox's striking looks - his is tall, thin and tattooed. Brother Jerry Fox, of Redding, told the newspaper that Fox 'likes to live on the edge. 'He is one of those people who likes to take things apart and put things back together and likes to see how things work.' Unusual: Unlike the cannonball seen above, the one used the incident was made by the two men and was not an antique, but it was still very harmful .","Richard Fox, 39, arrested by San Diego police officers .

More grim details emerged about the drug practices of the white supremacist couple who got high and had oral sex with a teenage babysitter who died that night. As a part of the ongoing trial of Dea Millerberg, the wife of Eric Millerberg, who is accused of helping him dispose of 16-year-old Alexis Rasmussen's dead body in September 2011, the Utah court heard more about the couple's drug friendly attitude. Mr Millerberg is a member of the Silent Arayan Warriors, a white supremacist gang, and one of his peers wrote a letter from prison about the torrid details that Mr Millerberg confessed. Trouble: At the time of Alexis' death, Eric Millerberg was on parole for prior burglary and firearm charges, and he was also known to be part of the Silent Aryan Warriors, a white supremacist prison gang . Help: Police reportedly received a confidential tip about the whereabouts of Alexis' body by members of Eric Millerberg's gang . Gang member Casey Peterson said Mr . Millerberg called himself a 'watcher of the flock' meaning that he felt . it important that he be the one to help teens do drugs 'so they wouldn't . go elsewhere and try it on their own' One of Alexis' friends, whose name was . not released, also testified that the two of them would go over to the . Millerberg's house to smoke drugs, and that the 36-year-old man was the . one to teach them how to smoke methamphetamine out of a light bulb. Peterson's statement, which was read . in court, confirmed the account of the night given by Mrs Millerberg, . saying that Alexis died in their home because of the drugs and they . could not revive her. The letter also detailed Mr . Millerberg's rehashing of he and his wife's sexual dalliances and drug . use with the teen prior to her death. 'I was paranoid and I did not want to be involved,' wrote Peterson, who is currently serving time for unknown charges. His motivation to help, however, was more personal: 'I have a 16-year-old daughter.' Peterson was not the only gang member . who found the Millerberg's behavior to be an affront, as Eric Smith has . been identified as the police informant who tipped them off to the . location of the body. Serious charges: Eric Millerberg, 36, is charged with far more involvement than his wife, and is said to be the one who actually killed the girl by injecting her with drugs . Dark side: During her testimony, Dea Millerberg said that Alexis asked the couple if she could have sex with them in August- a month before she died- and also requested to be paid with meth instead of cash . 'I wanted the family to have closure,' Mr Smith said. 'Then again, they came at me and said they knew about my involvement in it and that they'd give me immunity if I helped them.' New details also painted a grizzly . picture of the body itself when it was finally found, as detective Mike . Tribe said that Alexis's corpse was found kneeling face down, covered in . brush in a rural part of Morgan County. He said that her neon toe nail polish, ankle bracelets and jawline helped identify her. The added details come a day after Dea Millerberg told a Salt Lake City courtroom about the extent of their relationship with the girl before her death, including their varied drug use and group sex sessions. Months . after the September 10 death of Alexis, the Millerbergs were charged . for their involvement in her death and Mrs Millerberg testified against . her husband in court on Monday after receiving immunity for any direct . involvement with the girl’s death. Mrs Millerberg faces one third-degree . felony charge relating to the disposal of Alexis’ body, but prosecutors . have called her overall involvement ‘minimal’ as compared to Mr . Millerberg’s, as he faces charges of child abuse homicide, unlawful sex . with a minor, the disposal of the body and obstruction of justice. The 39-year-old, who filed for . divorce from her husband after they were charged with the death of . Alexis, told the torrid story of how the couple befriended and corrupted . the young girl in the months leading up to her death. Mrs . Millerberg said that they started using Alexis- or Lexi as she called . her- as a babysitter for their two daughters in the spring of 2011. Accomplice: Dea Millerberg, seen here in an earlier court appearance, discussed how she helped her husband Eric dispose of Alexis Rasmussen's body . Corrupted: Alexis Rasmussen, 16, reportedly asked the Millerbergs how to get meth and they started smoking the drug, along with heroin and marijuana, with the girl . They . became friends and started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana with . the teen before Alexis began requesting that they try harder drugs like . methamphetamine and heroin. Eventually they even began paying Alexis in meth. One of their most raucous nights as a . group came in August, a month before her death, when Alexis reportedly . asked to become sexually involved with the married couple. 'Eric and I started kissing and having sex. Then Alexis jumped in,' Mrs Millerberg told the court. On . the fateful night of September 10, the couple wanted Alexis to babysit . because they were going to go shopping for their daughter’s birthday. Neither babysitting nor shopping ended up happening. As . soon as Alexis arrived at the house, Mr Millerberg helped her get high . by injecting her with drugs- once with heroin and twice with meth- into . her arm and neck. Found: A full autopsy could not be performed because Alexis' body was so decomposed, but significant traces of heroin and meth were in her system . Then, . when she was ‘as high as she had ever been’, she and her husband . performed oral sex on one another. Mrs Millerberg says that she was not . involved in the encounter. A short while later, the drugs had a . negative effect on the teen and she started ‘freaking out’. She . reportedly felt disoriented and cold, so she asked if she could take a . warm bath in the couple’s master bathroom. After leaving her alone in the bath at . her request, the Millerbergs checked on her about 45 minutes later to . find that she was still cold, so Mrs Millerberg wrapped her in a blanket . and told her to lie down in another bedroom. The couple left her to go smoke some cigarettes, and returned about a half hour later to find her unresponsive. ‘She wasn't breathing. She had mucousy stuff coming out of the right side of her mouth,’ said Mrs Millerberg, who was a licensed nurse and tried to resuscitate the girl to no avail. They then tried to figure out what to do next. ‘It really was a panic. The idea of it was, we will lose our kids and go to jail, and there was nothing we could do to bring her back,’ she told the court. Mr Millerberg was on parole at the . time for prior burglary and firearm charges, and he was also known to be . part of the Silent Aryan Warriors, a white supremacist prison gang. Mrs . Millerberg, who also had outstanding court dates due to her involvement . with two unrelated prescription drug fraud and child endangerment . cases, says that she dressed the then-naked body of Alexis and put it . into a foot locker which the couple moved into a box in the trunk of . their car. Leaving their . 6-year-old daughter at home but taking their toddler with them, they . 'drove all over the place' disposing of any evidence that may connect . them to the crime. They . dumped her body in a remote area of Morgan County where Mr Millerberg . covered it with brush and shrubs so that it was hidden. Police only . found it six weeks after Alexis’ death with the help of a confidential . tip from Eric Smith, one of Mr Millerberg’s gang members. Moving . on to the remaining evidence, they left Alexis' purse in one dumpster . with the box that had held the body, then drove to a different dumpster . where they left the carpet from the car 'in case there was any evidence . on it'. Facing trial: Eric Millerberg is in prison awaiting trial and Dea Millerberg (right) is free on bail . Spot: The couple- along with their toddler- drove around extensively disposing of Alexis' body and all evidence. She was found here in Morgan County six weeks after her death . After filing for divorce from Mr Millerberg in February, Mrs Millerberg is free on bail but police say that she will ‘not get a walk on all of (her) charges’. So far, police officials seem to agree with Mrs Millerberg’s version of events though a full autopsy could not be completed because of the decomposition of the body. The state medical examiner did conclude that there was a serious amount of meth and heroin in the girl’s body at her time of death. ‘Drugs are dangerous and unpredictable. Every time you use drugs there is a chance of death,’ said medical examiner Dr Joseph White. Prosecutor Chris Shaw included the other charges against Mr Millerberg in his assessment, saying: ‘After a lengthy period of drug use ... and sexual misconduct, she died.’",Details emerging about 16-year-old Alexis Rasmussen's death .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . PUBLISHED: . 20:12 EST, 10 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:13 EST, 10 April 2012 . Colombian authorities have been frustrated in their attempts to file criminal charges against the young father of a baby born to a 10-year-old ethnic Wayuu girl. The Wayuu people have their own justice system and rarely co-operate with agents of the Colombian state in such matters, Maria Gladys Pabon, chief prosecutor in Riohacha, the regional capital, said yesterday. Under Colombian law, any sexual relations with a child age 14 or younger is a crime punishable by at least nine years in prison. Frustrated: The Colombian authorities say they are not getting any co-operation from members of the Wayuu tribe as they investigate the young father of this baby born to a 10-year-old girl . Mother: The girl, a member of the northern indigenous Wayuu tribe in the La Guajira Peninsula, was 39 weeks pregnant when she underwent a Caesarean . But legal and indigenous affairs experts say that under Colombia's 1991 constitution the Wayuu have jurisdiction. The girl, who cannot be identified by law, gave birth on March 29 via Caesarean section and is one of the youngest mothers on record. The father, who authorities say is 15, also cannot be identified. The baby weighed 5.6lbs (2.6kg) and measured 14.5ins (47cm), said Dr Fabio Gonzalez, who delivered the child in a private clinic in Riohacha, on the Guajira peninsula in Colombia's northeast coast. Dr Gonzalez said 'she barely understood what was happening' at the moment of birth. He added he had to operate because at that age the pelvis is still growing 'and it's too small for the fetus to pass through the vaginal canal.' Home: The town of Manaure is in the northern La Guajira Peninsula of Colombia . He said the mother, who was discharged from the clinic in good health, is also relatively short at 4ft, 7ins (142cm). When nurses took the newborn to her mother 'it was as if a doll was being given to her,' said Dr Gonzalez. 'She has no idea. She doesn't understand anything and that's normal,' he added. The doctor said it was not the first time he had delivered the baby of a 10-year-old girl. He said he had a similar case last year. In the latest case, the girl's parents took her to the clinic from their hometown of Manuare. Shame: The birth has been painful for the Wayuu (file picture), who mostly live on the Colombia-Venezuela border. But they do not believe she was raped . A Wayuu tribal leader, Rosa Iguaran, said the parents were refusing to speak to the media out of shame. She said the incident was also painful for the Wayuu, who number about 350,000 and mostly live in the Colombia-Venezuela border region. They don't consider that the girl was raped but rather that the baby was conceived in consensual sex. It will be up to the parents of both the boy and girl to decide whether the two should be married and what the boy's family owes the girl's family, whether it be 'necklaces, cows, goats, whatever the family agrees on,' said Iguaran. Pabon, the prosecutor, said the family of the girl has refused to co-operate with her in her investigation. She said she would not seek to arrest the father of the newborn without speaking with Wayuu leaders. Colombian constitutional law experts say such cases are always very complicated. Former Constitutional Court magistrate Rodrigo Escobar said that 'what the Indians can't do is submit a defendant to degrading treatment or the death penalty.' The world's youngest mother in a medically documented case was Lina Medina of Peru, who in 1939 produced an infant at the age of five years, eight months, according to the Guinness Book of Records.","Young mother gave birth to daughter two weeks ago .

Cleared: Redinel Dervishaj, 35, has been cleared of murder charges following the stabbing death of a groom-to-be outside his engagement party last month . A man who fatally stabbed a groom-to-be during his engagement party will not be indicted on murder charges, a grand jury announced today. The New York Grand jury reported a lack of evidence to indict 35-year-old Redinel Dervishaj with murder following last month's stabbing of 27-year-old Antonio Lacertosa on Staten Island. Dervishaj's team argued that the Albanian, currently on an immigration hold on Rikers Island, stabbed Mr Lacertosa with a butcher's knife in self-defense that was captured on camera. The grand jury reviewed that footage. 'Luckily a lot of it was captured on video,' defense attorney Thomas Reilly said, according to the New York Post. 'Not the actual stabbing,' he added, 'but everything leading up to it.' Mr Lacertosa was celebrating his September engagement to 24-year-old Bridgette Schneider outside a Staten Island restaurant when the deadly scene unfolded. Mr Reilly argued Mr Lacertosa's party had become rowdy and were confronted by Dervishaj and restaurant manager Ridi Zeneli when seen urinating on the Espana Restaurant and Lounge's exterior. According to Mr Reilly, surveillance video showed 'my client getting beaten, thrown over a car. He then runs to his own car to escape and is chased down by six guys who are throwing bottles at him.' Killed: 27-year-old Antonio Lacertosa was fatally stabbed while celebrating his engagement but a grand jury found it was in self-defense . Proposal: Antonio Lacertosa proposed to his girlfriend Bridgette in December . From there Mr Reilly said they dashed back into the restaurant after fleeing down an alley. Inside, Dervishaj grabbed the knife that would be used to stab Mr Lacertosa, fatally. 'My thoughts and prayers go out to Antonio Lacertosa’s family and to his . fianceé as they try to cope with the pain of their loss,' Staten Island District . Attorney Daniel Donovan released in a statement. 'His death was a tragic and senseless end to a night that began as . a celebration of a young couple’s new life together,' he wrote. Three days after the March 17th murder, Dervishaj was detained in Palo Hills, Illinois by the local authorities working in tandem with the New York City Police Department. Dervishaj has a violent past, police records show. In 2007 he was shot in the arm after brawling with Albanian mobsters. 'He was always nasty with an . attitude,' Dervishaj’s former next-door neighbor, Mike Nuzzolo, 56, told . the New York Daily News. 'He was always yelling and screaming at . somebody. I kept the windows closed so I wouldn’t have to hear him. He . was just unpleasant.' 'This guy stabbed me! Call an ambulance!' Mr Lacertosa's last words cried as he clutched his side that fateful night. Crime scene: The area surrounding the restaurant was cordoned off, with a trail of dried blood stretching across the driveway and blue forensics gloves abandoned in the gutter . Scene: Witnesses said a restaurant worker was seen grabbing a kitchen knife and plunging it into Mr Lacertosa's chest while the jury saw video of a prior chase . His fiancée . tried to help by administering CPR, and friends used restaurant linens . to try to absorb the bleeding, but nothing worked. They put him in a car and began driving to the hospital before flagging down an ambulance that they saw en route. Mr Lacertosa was taken to Staten Island University Hospital where he later died. The night started as a celebratory . one, as Mr Lacertosa and his high school sweetheart Ms Schneider . gathered with family and friends for a formal engagement dinner. The group ended up having drinks at a restaurant where an argument apparently broke out with the management staff, according to a police source. In love: The pair were due to marry in eight months. Lacertosa popped the question in December . Mr Lacertosa's sister, Antonia, told the New York Times that things got heated, with a fight breaking out into the street at around two o'clock on Saturday morning. She said her brother went outside to see what was going on and was stabbed. Witnesses added that a worker was . seen grabbing a kitchen knife and plunging it into Mr Lacertosa’s chest. The restaurant manager turned himself into police for questioning. 'He . had everything,' Antonia, 29, said. 'He would have made a great father. No one would ever say anything bad about my brother. 'He was the greatest. He was a great brother, son, uncle, friend. He was big, and muscular, but he was a teddy bear.' Long term: Antonio Lacertosa and his fiancee Bridgette were childhood sweethearts, having met at Tottenville High School . The suspect fled the scene, leaving Mr Lacertosa, from the Pleasant Plains neighbourhood of Staten Island, bleeding to death outside. The area surrounding the restaurant was cordoned off, with a trail of dried blood stretching across the driveway and blue forensics gloves abandoned in the gutter. Investigators have not yet identified the killer. Planning now for a funeral instead of a wedding, Mr Lacertosa’s fiancée, Bridgette, was too distraught to talk. A photo on their wedding website shows a smiling Mr Lacertosa with his arm around a beaming Bridgette. The couple, who met at Tottenville High School, were shopping for a house in the neighborhood, Mr Lacertosa’s brother said. The brother added that Mr Lacertosa was 'a good kid. He carried this whole household.'","Grand jury found lack of evidence to indict Redinel Dervishaj, 35, with murder charges .

"By . Laura Cox . UPDATED: . 01:44 EST, 7 March 2012 . Ralph McQuarrie, the artist who developed the look of the first Star Wars trilogy's signature characters, sets and spaceships, has died, aged 82. McQuarrie's death Saturday at his Berkeley home was announced on his official website and Facebook page. John Scoleri, co-author of a book on McQuarrie's art, told the LA Times that McQuarrie had suffered from Parkinson's disease. Famous: Ralph MrQuarrie was best known for his Star Wars designs . In a statement on the official Star Wars website, George Lucas said McQuarrie was the first person he hired to help him envision what would become some of the top-grossing movies of all time. 'His genial contribution, in the form of unequaled production paintings, propelled and inspired all of the cast and crew of the original Star Wars trilogy,' Lucas said. 'When words could not convey my ideas, I could always point to one of Ralph's fabulous illustrations.' Talent: Original sketches of Imperial Storm Troopers by artist Ralph McQuarrie who developed the look of the first 'Star Wars' trilogy's signature characters, sets and spaceships . In a 2011 interview with the Australian newspaper the Daily Telegraph, McQuarrie said his work on Star Wars was 'a special opportunity to start from the ground up. 'Being able to create new characters, vehicles and different worlds…and since when I started it wasn't even clear that the film would be made, I didn't have to limit myself.' He and Lucas would meet every few weeks, McQuarrie recalled, and 'he would explain what he was looking for and leave me to my work. 'Next visit, we would go over my drawings and discuss any changes. We had a very good working relationship.' McQuarrie's original concepts included the look of some of pop culture's most recognizable characters, including Darth Vader, C-3P0 and R2-D2. He also created the look of the Stormtroopers and the lightsaber. Experienced: McQuarrie worked as a technical illustrator at Boeing before his career in the film industry took off. He saw combat in the Korean War and survived a bullet that pierced his helmet. Other movies to which McQuarrie contributed concept illustrations included Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. He won an Academy Award for Visual Effects for his work on the 1985 film Cocoon.

"By . Eddie Wrenn . UPDATED: . 10:03 EST, 7 March 2012 . Shot dead in exercise: PC Ian Terry was killed in 2008 during a training exercise . Greater Manchester Police is to face charges over the death of an officer who was shot dead by a colleague in a bungled 'cops and robbers' training exercise, it was announced today. The force will be prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive over alleged breaches that led to the death of PC Ian Terry in June 2008. Two GMP officers are also being prosecuted by the HSE. The development comes after the Crown Prosecution Service announced yesterday there is still insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the force in relation to the father-of-two’s death. GMP Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said: 'The Health and Safety Executive has today announced that it is to prosecute Greater Manchester Police and two of our officers for breaching section 2 and section 7 of the Health and Safety Act. 'It has been nearly four years since Ian Terry tragically died, four years that Ian’s family and colleagues have had to wait for this protracted decision to be made.' An inquest held at Manchester Coroner’s Court in March 2010 found that PC Terry was unlawfully killed. The jury ruled there was a catalogue of failures not only by the officer who shot PC Terry but also in the planning, training and safety measures. PC Terry, 32, from Burnley, Lancashire, brandished an unloaded handgun during the exercise while playing the role of a criminal fleeing in a car. He was gunned down by his close friend as the unit practised in a disused factory. On seeing him holding the gun the officer, granted anonymity during the inquest and identified only as Chris, told the jury he acted 'instinctively' and pulled the trigger on his Remington 870 pump-action 12-bore shotgun. 'Deepest apologies': The force apologised again for the incident which cost PC Terry his life . PC Terry, who was not wearing body armour, was hit from a distance of about 12 inches by a blank round of a specialist ammunition called round irritant personnel, which is not designed to kill but can be deadly at such close range. Mr Shewan said 'a number of changes' had been made to ensure training exercises involving firearms were carried out in the safest way possible since the tragedy. He added: 'I have been in contact with Ian’s family since his death in 2008 and once again I would like to extend our deepest apologies to them for loss of their much loved son, father and husband. 'Alongside today’s decision there are a further eight officers who still have outstanding misconduct matters against them. 'We cannot make a decision as to when these matters will be dealt with until we have seen the full disclosure files from the HSE for this case. 'Since 2008 GMP has fully co-operated with all of the agencies involved with this and as this is now a HSE prosecution it would be inappropriate for us to make any further comment at this stage.' The HSE said it had concluded there was sufficient evidence and it was in the public interest to prosecute the force and two of its training staff for criminal offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. It said summonses would be served on GMP for an alleged breach of Section 2 of the act, on the officer responsible for running the course for an alleged breach of Section 7 of the act and on one of the exercise safety officers, who assisted the lead officer running the course, for an alleged breach of Section 7 of the act.","PC Ian Terry was killed in 'guns and robbers' exercise in 2008 .

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 16:06 EST, 13 July 2011 . Already charged: Alleged 'Hollywood Ripper' Michael Gargiulo, 35, has been charged with killing three women . The accused 'Hollywood Ripper' suspected of killing actor Ashton Kutcher’s ex-girlfriend could be responsible for up to 10 murders, a detective claims. Michael Gargiulo, 35, is already facing trial over the violent stabbing deaths of two female victims and was charged last week with murdering a third. But a Los Angeles homicide detective claims Gargiulo may have allegedly killed up to 10 women he came into contact with as an air-conditioning repairman. Gargiulo was charged with murder in 2008 of Los Angeles women Ashley Ellerin, 22, in 2001, who was dating Mr Kutcher, and mother-of-four Maria Bruno, 32, in 2005. Then last week Gargiulo was also charged with murdering Tricia Pacaccio, 18, in 1993, in Chicago, Illinois - his third alleged victim. But now Los Angeles County sheriff’s homicide detective Mark Lillienfeld has revealed a statement allegedly made by Gargiulo in jail. Killed: Tricia Pacaccio, left, was stabbed in Chicago in 1993, while Ashley Ellerin, right, Ashton Kutcher's ex-girlfriend, was killed in her home in 2001 in California . Gargiulo told authorities in Los . Angeles County Jail that his job took him to thousands of homes over the years, . reported the Chicago Sun-Times. But he allegedly added that just . because 10 women in those homes were killed and his DNA was found does . not mean he murdered anyone. Police have only linked him to the . murders of Ellerin, Bruno and Pacaccio so far, but Mr Lillienfeld . believes there are other victims. Statement: Ashton Kutcher, shown in January with wife Demi Moore, testified about the 2001 death of his ex-girlfriend . The statement was made public during a Los Angeles court hearing, Mr Lillienfeld claimed to the Chicago Sun-Times. However Cook Country officials say . they have listened to recordings of Gargiulo and looked back at court . transcripts and found no incriminating statements. A spokesman for Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez slammed Mr Lillienfeld’s comments as ‘inflammatory and misleading’. ‘In our assessment, there were no . admissions made that could be used to connect and prove his involvement . in other murders,’ the spokesman told the Chicago Sun-Times. ‘Clearly, if admissions were made . that could be proven in a court of law, Gargiulo would likely be facing . additional charges by prosecutors in Los Angeles.’ Gargiulo was arrested in 2008 after allegedly stabbing a Santa Monica woman who fought with an intruder who broke into her home. DNA found at the scene matched that . of Garguilo, and investigators then linked him to the murders of Ellerin . and Bruno - before Pacaccio last week. Mr Kutcher, now married to Demi . Moore, told police Ellerin never came to the door when he went to her . home to pick her up for a Grammy Awards party. Her bloodstained body was found later inside the house. Gargiulo has denied killing the three woman he has been charged with murdering.","Michael Gargiulo already facing trial over two deaths .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 02:07 EST, 8 March 2012 . CCTV footage has revealed that the wrong-way driver who slammed into a car killing three sorority sisters had been spotted by police less than a minute before and was being chased - but it was too late. State Highway Patrol in Ohio released the dashboard camera video yesterday that showed police  on the driver's tail just moments before the horrific collision that  killed the motorist and three  Bowling Green University students on Interstate 75, south of Toledo. On the CCTV footage from last Friday, the trooper's car . can be seen travelling along the four-lane highway when it has to swerve . into the other lane to avoid a driver going in the wrong direction. Scroll down for video . Too late: Seconds after Ohio Highway Patrol spotted a car travelling the wrong way, there was a head-on collision which killed the driver and three sorority sisters . On the lookout: Troopers had reports of a driver going the wrong way down the highway, who they spotted (left of the picture) and immediately made a U-turn to tail . The trooper . immediately slowed down and pulled a U-turn, tailing the dangerous . driver. Tragically, the officer only travels for around ten seconds but was . unable to catch up with the car which is then seen lying in the middle . of the road having been involved in a crash. He's heard saying: 'Bowling Green, give me a squad.' The five Alpha Xi Delta members travelling in . the car were part of a convoy of vehicles with 11 other sisters headed to . Detroit airport for a trip to the Dominican Republic. The first of two cars, each carrying five sorority sisters, swerved to miss the car on the interstate. Just minutes after the crash, the video recorded the voice of an unidentified Alpha Xi Delta member who came running to help. The girl said: 'Sir, what can we do to help? They were with us. Those are our sisters. We were all on spring break.' The trooper replied: 'I want you to go, just go stay by the car. Stay with the car, please. Go stay up there with the car.' On the scene: Emergency crews work to free the five young women who were in the car at the time of the horrific crash in Ohio. Three died and two were seriously injured . Tragedy: Three sisters were killed in this car after it crashed head-on into another car driving the wrong way . Having realised the severity of the crash, the officers took the girls from the other car which avoided the crash away from the scene. Spokeswoman Lt Anne Ralston from highway patrol said the trooper was limited by the short amount of time between a call about the wrong-way driver and the crash. 'It didn't really afford us the opportunity to use any other tactics,' she said. 'It really limited what he was able to do.' She added: 'These types of calls of one-way drivers, especially on the interstate, are very dangerous, obviously, and very unpredictable and there's really no set rules on how to handle that, just because every incident is so different.' All dead: Christina Goyett, Sarah Hammond and Rebekah Blakkolb (left-to-right) seen in their school photos . Sarah Hammond, 21, a junior from Yellow Springs, Rebekah Blakkolb, 20, a junior from Aurora and sophomore Christina Goyett, 19, from Bay City, Michigan all died in the crash. The wrong-way driver, 69-year-old Winifred Lein, of Perrysburg, was traveling alone and was pronounced dead at the scene. It was believed that she was on her way home from work. The injured were freshman Angelica . Mormile, 19, from Garfield Heights, Ohio; and Kayla Somoles, 19, a . sophomore from Cleveland, Ohio. There were 16 sorority sisters on their way to a . Dominican Republic resort. ‘I . don't think the college girls ever saw it coming,’ Wood County Sheriff . Mark Wasylyshyn said. ‘Nothing they could have done to avoid the crash. ‘They were just driving . northbound and a woman driving in the opposite direction in the wrong . way on the roadway hit them head-on.’ In hospital: Two other students were injured - Angelica Mormile, 19, left, and Kayla Somoles, 19, right . Christina was driving the vehicle and . Angelica was in the front passenger seat. Kayla was in the right rear . seat, Rebekah was in the rear middle and Sarah was in the rear left. Rebekah . was taken to hospital and later died, but Christina and Sarah . died at the scene - along with Ms Lein. Christina and Angelica were . wearing seatbelts, but Rebekah and Kayla were not. Ms Lein was wearing a seatbelt but it's unknown if Sarah had one on, reported the BG News. Four drivers called 911 . after 2:10am to report a car going south in the northbound lanes of the . road. Christina's family friend Dee Bishop . said she had left with friends planning to be at Detroit airport by 2am . on Friday in preparation for a 5.30am flight.

"By . Eddie Wrenn . UPDATED: . 08:24 EST, 7 March 2012 . 'Experienced golfer': The jury heard that Leigh Neilly, 41, had a handicap of 11 . A man who pocketed £38,000 in disability allowance was filmed by investigators taking part in a golf competition, a court has heard. Leigh Neilly entered a claim for Disability Living Allowance in 2001, stating he could barely walk or carry out everyday tasks unaided as he was suffering from motor neurone disease. In the nine years he was claiming benefits, the 41-year-old was paid a total of £38,748 by the Department of Work and Pensions. But a surveillance operation carried out by the DWP in April 2010 filmed Neilly, of Silloth, Cumbria, striking golf balls with ease, riding a bike one-handed and carrying out renovation work on his home. Carlisle Crown Court was shown footage of Leigh Neilly lifting a golf club high above his head to strike balls on a course which is described as 'undulating' and 'demanding'. He was also filmed lying down on the ground to paint a gate at his home and bending down to rummage through boxes at a market. The defendant, who switched to . representing himself mid-way through yesterday's proceedings, has been . charged with two counts relating to benefit fraud. Alan Robinson, chief investigator at the DWP, filmed Neilly at Silloth car boot sale shopping for records, which showed Nielly bending down to look at some LPs in boxes for several minutes. Giving evidence at the trial Mr Robinson said: 'The defendant did not use a walking aid or seek assistance. He did not fall over or stumble. He did not walk at anything other than a normal pace. 'There were no indications he was in any pain at all.' In another clip shown to the jury Neilly can be seen lying on the ground, painting a gate. Mr Robinson told the court: 'I did not at any point see him fall, stumble, drop his paint brush or show any obvious signs of pain.' He added that Neilly had cycled to the shops and back before resuming the painting. Neilly was also filmed completing the fourth to fifteenth holes at Silloth Golf Course with some companions as part of a competition. The court was told Neilly regularly plays competitive golf, and has a handicap of 11. While Neilly said in his disibility claims that his legs are prone 'to giving way at any time', Mr Robinson said that at no point did the defendant stumble, fall or show any obvious signs of discomfort. He added: 'The course is undulating, it is quite a demanding course, it is a championship course.' As the footage played, prosecutor Tim Evans said: 'Mr Neilly dose not appear to be holding anyone back, he is leading the way to the next tee.' The barrister estimated the length of the course was just under four miles long, although Neilly had only been filmed completing the fourth to fifteen holes. The court in Carlisle heard that Neilly 'would lead the way to the next tee' while playing competitive golf . Solway Golf Club: Investigators watched as Neilly played a round . At the start of proceedings Neilly stated that he no longer wished to be represented by his barrister. He will represent himself throughout the rest of the trial. Representing himself this afternoon, Leigh Nielly asked for the DVD footage to be replayed to the court and stopped at certain points. Then, indicating the television screen he said: 'I am using a motorised trolley on the golf course.' Halting the DVD for a second time Nielly continued: 'What I am doing here is taking a pain killer. I am having a drink and taking a pain killer.' Addressing Mr Robinson, Nielly said: 'Can you tell if I am in any pain or discomfort?' 'I can look at you and see there are no signs you are in any pain or discomfort,' Mr Robinson replied. 'Can you feel my discomfort?' Nielly asked again. 'No, I cannot feel anybody else's discomfort,' said Mr Robinson. Phyllis Duffy, a decision maker for the DWP, told the court: 'Disability living allowance is a benefit for the severely disabled. It depends on the needs that arise from the disability and not on the disability itself. 'People with individual disabilites cope differently with them. It all depends on the individual.' She told the court that Neilly had stated in application forms for . benefit that he was so 'severely disabled he was virtually unable to . walk'. Mr Evans asked Mrs Duffy if the disability allowance would have been paid to Neilly had she been aware of what he was able to do. 'No,' she replied. Neilly, of Wampool Street, Silloth, Cumbria denies dishonest representation for the purposes of obtaining benefits. He denies a further charge of dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances, affecting his entitlement to benefit. The trial continues.","Golfer claimed £38,000 in disability benefits despite playing competitive matches, jurors told .

"Authorities were searching at Lake Ellenor, in Orlando, where signal from phone was last traced . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 13:33 EST, 8 December 2011 . Released: Police have not said when or where they found Ms Parker's phone but did release a photo of Ms Parker that was stored on the phone as well as one of the iPhone itself . An iPhone belonging to missing Florida woman Michelle Parker has been found by police officers investigating her disappearance. The 33-year-old's sister has confirmed the phone belongs to Ms Parker, but officers have not revealed when or where the device was found. They have released two new photos, however: one of Ms Parker taken from her iPhone and one of the phone itself, covered in its black and pink Hurley case. This is the latest break in the case that has now entered its third week. The . search for the mother-of-two, who was last seen on November 17, . expanded with authorities looking for evidence at Lake Ellenor, in . Orlando, Florida, where the signal from her phone was last traced. The . expansion comes after a judge ruled that the three-year-old twins faced . no imminent danger in the care of their father and Ms Parker's her . former partner Dale Smith, 40, who is the police's prime suspect in the . case. The twins were taken out of Mr Smith's care last week because of police suspicions, but has had no charged filed against him. Ms . Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, wiped away tears after the hearing and . said that they would work with Mr Smith and his attorneys to figure out . a plan in which she could visit the children. She briefly hugged Smith . after the hearing. 'I hugged Dale to tell him that my grandbabies - I want to be able to see them,' Mrs Stewart said. 'And I hope we can work something out because they're so important to me and my family. He said he would work it out with us.' Usable: Police said that the iPhone, shown in its case here, was in fine condition when it was found . Ms Parker's sister echoed her mother's . sentiments, saying that the family has not told her sister's children . that she is missing and instead hopes that a better outcome will happen . before they need to. 'When I first heard that she was missing, of course my mind went to Dale,' said sister Lauren Erickson says. 'I . know their history, and they have had a lot of issues. But I really do . hope and pray that he had nothing to do with it. He could be totally . innocent; I hope he is. But if he knows something, he needs to tell . everything that he knows,' Ms Erickson continued. Ms . Parker disappeared on November 17, the same day an episode of 'The . People's Court' aired in which she and Mr Smith argued over who was . responsible for the cost of a missing $5,000 engagement ring. Joe Iuzzolino, an attorney for the . Florida Department of Children and Families, told Judge Turner today . that Mr Smith had displayed abusive and criminal behavior on multiple . occasions since 1992 that included him striking Ms Parker in front of . the children in 2009 . But . with no evidence that Smith had abused the children, the judge wasn't . persuaded that they should be removed from his care. The children have . been living with Mr Smith and his parents since the 33-year-old Parker . disappeared. Silence: Dale Smith is mobbed by the media as he leaves the Florida courtroom after gaining custody of this three-year-old twins back . Support: The mother of missing Michelle Parker, Yvonne Stewart, hugs her daughter's ex-fiance Dale Smith at a custody hearing for Ms Parker's children in Orlando, Florida, last week . The judge said: 'I don't think incidents that happened years ago constitute a pattern.' As to Ms Parker's disappearance, the . judge said: 'I can speculate like everyone else what's happened to Miss . Parker. But there's no evidence.' Mr Smith's attorney, Mark NeJame, has said his client has done nothing wrong and he has not been charged. 'We've . maintained throughout that this has been overstated and overblown by . the police department and there's been a rush to indict,' he said. Mr Smith and Ms Parker had been together off and on since 2006 before appearing on the television show. Mystery: Michelle Parker, left, has been missing since November 17. Her ex-fiance Dale Smith has been given custody of their twins, three, even though he is the main suspect in her disappearance in Florida . Ms Parker said they got into a heated argument in a hotel that included her throwing the engagement ring at him. It fell nine stories into the hotel atrium, and they couldn't find it. The television judge said they needed to split the cost of the ring. Court records show Ms Parker filed for . a domestic violence injunction against Mr Smith in 2009 but the order . was dismissed after a hearing. Mr . Smith has had traffic infractions and arrests on a misdemeanor drug . charge and a misdemeanor charge of possession of an opened container of . alcohol in a car, according to court records. The most serious charge he . faced was for aggravated battery in 1996. He pleaded guilty and a . prison sentence was withheld. Orlando Police Chief Paul Rooney revealed that Smith had 'simply refused' to take a polygraph test when it was offered to him. Last sighting: Ms Parker appeared on an episode of The People's Court with her ex-partner on November 17 . Stormy: The couple went on the show to settle a dispute over an engagement ring . During a press conference, Ms Parker's mother made an emotional plea to her daughter's former partner. Ms . Stewart said: 'You could have avoided this Dale, if you had cooperated . with the police and took a polygraph test when they asked you, you could . have avoided a lot of stress. 'So unfortunately, you brought this on yourself. We're not going to stop until we find out who did this.' Mrs . Stewart added: 'Dale, honestly, if you're out there, honey, and you're . listening to me, I have always said from day one - it's okay if couples . fight. 'If you made a . mistake, it was just a second of ""oh, I lost my head,"" or whatever and . you didn't know what to do... our family needs to have Michelle home. We . need to heal.' Together: Pictures from Facebook show the couple, who are said to have had a tumultuous relationship . Happier times: Parker had previously applied for a restraining order against her partner, but it was denied . Meanwhile photos of Mr Smith taking part in a racy Hottest Men of 2007 competition have emerged, not helping to paint him in a good light. He is seen stripping to his boxers in the competition in his home city, Orlando, Florida. Photographs of Smith in the competition show him stripping down to his underwear as he dances to music and waves a cowboy hat on stage. The racy moves are for an annual competition held by Orlando radio station XL1067.

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 10:28 EST, 7 March 2012 . The United Nation's aid chief finally arrived in Syria today - and is now making her way to the devastated city of Homs. Valerie Amos held talks in the capital Damascus with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is now en route to the rebel-stronghold city. She will arrive to find a city destroyed by four weeks of bombing by troops loyal to President Bashar Assad's who are trying to stub out a year-long uprising against his regime. In Syria: UN aid chief Valerie Amos is in the country and heading towards the rebel stronghold city of Homs . Rocked: Fire rages in a house in the embattled northwestern province of Idlib, which is also being targeted in a crackdown by Assad's troops . Amos, who was denied access to Syria last week, is in the country on a three-day mission to try to persuade authorities to grant unhindered access for aid workers. This, she says, is key to delivering life-saving assistance to civilians. The trip comes as Assad defies mounting international pressure to end the year-old crackdown on an uprising against him. According to state news agency SANA, Assad said yesterday he will continue to confront 'foreign-backed terrorism.' Since the uprising began last March, he has blamed armed gangs and foreign terrorists for the unrest, not protesters seeking change. The UN says more than 7,500 people have been killed since Syria's uprising began. Activists put the death toll at more than 8,000. Despite the growing bloodshed, President Barack Obama said yesterday that unilateral U.S. military action against Assad's regime would be a mistake. Confiscated: This picture shows weapons seized by Syrian troops as they continue their crackdown in the rebel stronghold of Homs . Happy: Syrian soldiers take time out from bombing civilians to dance with government supporters in front of a portrait of Bashar Assad . The United States said it is proposing a new United Nations Security Council resolution demanding an end to violence in Syria, first by government forces and then by opposition fighters. Russia and China, powerful Syrian allies that have blocked a Security Council resolution against Syria, have made clear they were still standing by the regime in Damascus. Still, in a sign of China's growing alarm, Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said Beijing was pulling its workers out of Syria because of the violence. 'I can tell you most Chinese workers have been withdrawn from that country to China,' he told a news conference today. 'There are only about 100 people left there taking care of projects, assets and property. We will wait until the local situation stabilises. We will go back to Syria and restart those projects.' Abandoned: Families forced to flee from Homs to eastern Lebanon have recounted the scene in their former home . Carnage: Around 60 civilians have been killed as troops loyal to President Bashar Assad bombed bridges to stop them from fleeing to safety across the border to Lebanon . Obama has resisted calls to step into the turmoil in Syria to stop Assad's bloody crackdown on protesters. He told a news conference yesterday that the international community has not been able to muster a campaign against Syria like the one in Libya that ousted Muammar Gaddafi last year. 'For us to take military action unilaterally, as some have suggested, or to think that somehow there is some simple solution, I think is a mistake,' Obama said. 'What happened in Libya was we mobilised the international community, had a UN Security Council mandate, had the full co-operation of the region, Arab states, and we knew that we could execute very effectively in a relatively short period of time.

Obama's strategy has been to use sanctions and international diplomatic isolation to pressure Assad into handing over power. The top U.S. commander in the Middle East said the advanced air defence weapons Russia has provided to Syria would make it difficult to establish a no-fly zone there as part of an effort to help the rebellion. Marine General James Mattis, head of U.S. Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee it would take a significant military commitment even to create safe havens in Syria where aid could be delivered, as McCain suggested.

He's been jailed for 10 years . A hip-hop producer who befriended Justin Timberlake and P Diddy has been jailed for ten years for masterminding a drug-trafficking ring that used private jets to smuggle cocaine and cash across America. Ricky 'DP' Brascom, the CEO of Behind da Scenes Entertainment, led a gang of 14 who shipped nearly 400kg of drugs and $4million in cash between Los Angeles and Baltimore. His brother and partner, Jerome 'Bro-Bro' Brascom, was also sentenced at a Los Angeles court yesterday and given six years. Both pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges after being arrested in 2010 with 12 others during a federal investigation dubbed 'Operation Snowbird'. At the time of his arrest, Ricky Brascom had been living a life of luxury. He was a famous face in rap circles, having produced a music video with P Diddy, and had been a guest at Justin Timberlake's birthday party in Las Vegas. One of his neighbours in the illustrious gated community of LA's Woodland Hills was Dr Dre and he drove around in a $250,000 2010 Aston Martin Rapides, according to The Daily Beast.

Britain's largest electricity supplier EDF will pay back a paltry £50 to households as penance for its doorstep selling practices. The French-owned energy giant admitted door-to-door staff were not trained to give customers all the information they needed. And call centre workers trying to sell the firm’s energy tariffs would boast about possible savings without knowing whether the statements were accurate. £4.5m settlement: EDF staff failed to provide potential customers with complete information, ruled Ofgem . An investigation by energy watchdog Ofgem exposed gaping holes in EDF’s policies designed to prevent vulnerable customers being ripped off by cold-calling salesmen. While the firm did have measures in place, they did not go far enough, the regulator ruled. Faced with a mammoth fine, the power group said it would pay out £3.5million to the poorest households it supplies. But the sum comes to only £50 for  each of the 70,000 homes judged to be ‘needy’ by the firm. The company also agreed to pay £1million to an energy awareness campaign run by Citizens Advice. The £4.5million total is, however, the largest penalty payout ever demanded from an energy firm in this country. The 70,000 homes receiving the one-off payment are already on the company’s Warm Home Discount scheme, where they receive a rebate of £120 a year. However, the average EDF dual fuel bill . is still £1,129 each year, and even with the extra £50 saving, families . will have to fork out almost £1,000 to heat their homes. EDF acknowledged 'limited shortcomings' during 2010 . Last month EDF Energy unveiled profits of £1.6billion – £427 for each of its 3.7million UK customers. Yesterday the company admitted ‘limited shortcomings’ in its sales in 2010 – the period investigated by Ofgem. Martin Lawrence, managing director of energy sourcing and customer supply, said: ‘We’re obviously disappointed that we failed to live up to the high standards that we expect of ourselves. ‘As soon as the issue was identified we immediately took action.’ Ofgem is also investigating ScottishPower, SSE (formerly Scottish and Southern Energy) and npower. Sarah Harrison, of Ofgem, said:'In the energy market in general much . more needs to be done to restore consumer confidence and all energy . suppliers should now get behind Ofgem’s reforms to introduce a simpler, . clearer and more competitive energy market.' The EDF payout comes just 24 hours after it was named the worst of the major power suppliers for customer service. Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at Consumer Focus, said it was positive that an energy company has worked with the regulator to tackle the issue. She added: 'We've called for Ofgem to have the power to make sure energy customers benefit from any fines - so it's good news that this voluntary approach has led to customers being compensated rather than money returned to the Treasury.' Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said tougher rules were now in place over the information suppliers have to provide to their customers. He added: 'We are now looking at beefing up Ofgem's powers further so it can make companies compensate consumers directly in cases like this, rather than having to rely on a voluntary approach.'","French-owned energy company will pay out £3.5m to vulnerable customers rather than face larger fine .

"By . Rebecca Camber . UPDATED: . 20:05 EST, 7 March 2012 . A deal to lend Rebekah Brooks a police horse was agreed over lunch with the boss of Scotland Yard, the Leveson Inquiry heard yesterday. Former Met commissioner Lord Blair said he had been dining with the former Sun and News of the World editor on the day she called the force’s media chief asking to ‘foster’ a retired police horse. Yesterday Lord Blair attempted to distance himself from the saga dubbed ‘Horsegate’, which has come to symbolise the dubious links between the Metropolitan Police and Rupert Murdoch’s News International. Lord Blair said he had no recollection of a conversation with Rebekah Brooks over the loan of a Met Police horse . He said he had ‘absolutely no recollection’ of talking to Mrs Brooks about the horse and denied giving the authority for the animal named Raisa to be handed into her care. But he accepted evidence from force press chief Dick Fedorcio that it would have been discussed over their lunch. Lord Blair told the inquiry: ‘He (Mr Fedorcio) was telephoned by Rebekah Brooks asking about this arrangement – she had heard that this arrangement existed and he arranged for her to go down to see the inspector in charge of horses... Rebekah Brooks (left) contacted Dick . Fedorcio (right) about the loan of a Met horse the day she had a lunch . meeting with Ian Blair . ‘This seems to have happened on the day that I had lunch with her and, what I understand Mr Fedorcio is going to say, that this was discussed at the lunch. 'I have absolutely no recollection of that.’ Mrs Brooks, who was arrested last year on suspicion of phone hacking and making corrupt payments to police, adopted the horse after it retired from active service in 2008. She paid food and vet bills until Raisa was rehoused with a police officer in 2010, months before fresh investigations began into illegal activities at the News of the World. Lord Blair said that Andy Hayman (pictured) was investigated over allegations of leaks to the press . The horse, which last week the Prime Minister was forced to admit he had ridden at Mrs Brooks’ farm in Oxfordshire, was returned to the force in a ‘poor condition’ and later died of natural causes. The Leveson Inquiry also heard yesterday how the teenage sons of two former Met commissioners were given work experience at The Sun. Lord Blair said ‘it was a perfectly normal process’ to get his 15-year-old son a week’s work experience at the tabloid in July 2005 during his time as commissioner. Lord Blair when he was commissioner pictured with Boris Johnson. He says that at the time he was unaware of how widespread phone hacking was . He also claimed his predecessor Lord Condon had arranged for his child to do work experience at News International. The revelations came as it emerged that detectives wanted to mount a corruption probe into journalists bribing police as long ago as 2000. The investigation was blocked by Met commander Andy Hayman who was later to become the subject of an inquiry into police leaks to journalists. Bob Quick ordered an inquiry into John Yates's phone calls, to which Mr Yates responded that he was 'too well connected' Former Met assistant commissioner Bob Quick compiled a report in 2000 claiming journalists from The Sun and other tabloids were offering bungs of £500 to £2,000 to officers for stories about celebrities caught up in police investigations. In a statement to the inquiry, he said the force had accumulated a ‘huge volume of intelligence’. But Mr Hayman, who was in charge of professional standards, raised ‘evidential challenges’ and the probe was not launched because it was considered ‘too risky’. Bob Quick, former assistant commissioner for specialist operations said that he recommended an investigation into police corruption at the Met. As part of that probe he called for a 'retrospective analysis' of then-assistant commissioner John Yates's phone records but he refused. According to Mr Quick, Mr Yates said 'I am too well connected', and when this line of inquiry was further pressed, Yates told him 'No... I am very well connected'. Quick told Lord Leveson that he thought this was 'a bit of theatre' and when his concerns were taken to commissioner Paul Stephenson it was made clear that matters would not be taken any further. Mr Quick said concerns were raised by Sir Gus O'Donnell, chief secretary to the cabinet, who specifically spoke about Mr Yates's relationship with the press. He told Sir Gus a few days later that 'there were no leaks or malpractice'.

"Victim's screams and cries for help heard after she accidentally calls 999 . Arrogant Matthew Duggan tells police he deserves better cell because he is 'better than anyone else here' By . David Baker . PUBLISHED: . 13:14 EST, 9 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:18 EST, 9 March 2012 . Appalling: Wealthy estate agent Matthew Duggan has been jailed for six years after a court heard the brutal rape was broadcast on the victim's mobile phone which accidentally dialled 999 during the attack . An estate agent who boasted that he was better than anyone else raped a young woman unaware that his brutal attack was heard by emergency services via the screaming victim’s mobile phone. Matthew Duggan from Sunbury-Upon-Thames, Middlesex, beat the 19-year-old girl black and blue before forcing her to perform oral sex on him and trying to have sex with her. But what neither he nor his bruised and bloodied victim realised was . that her mobile had somehow dialled 999 - meaning her cries for . help and his angry threats were heard by control operators manning an . emergency switchboard. The 20-year-old Duggan was jailed for six years after being . found guilty of rape and attempted rape by a jury, following an eight day . trial at Guildford Crown Court. He was also ordered to be put on the sex offenders register indefinitely. The court even heard how the arrogant defendant told police when he was arrested: 'I should be put in a more luxurious cell because I’m better than anyone else here'. The chillling remark was kept from the jury at Duggan’s trial but was read out by the Judge, Recorder Jeremy Carter-Manning, at today’s sentencing hearing. Jailing the defendant the Judge told him: 'You have an inappropriate opinion of your status and an inappropriate attitude towards women'. The Judge added: 'Your behaviour that evening was absolutely appalling and very serious indeed'. He also said there were unusual features to the case which made it of particular concern but that it was only Duggan’s comparative youth that had saved him from a much longer sentence. The Judge added: 'Bizarrely, and for some . reason that we don’t know, a mobile phone at the scene recorded and . transmitted to the emergency services details of what was a very . harrowing incident'. Jailed: Duggan was sentenced to six years in jail at Guildford Crown Court today for rape. The brutal attack was inadvertently heard by police operators after the victim's phone accidentally called 999 . A recording of the incident was played to the jury, in which the terrified girl was heard begging for mercy as the defendant yelled: 'Open your legs. You’re getting raped.' Today’s hearing was told by defence counsel, Mr. Jon Swain, that his client came from a respectable supportive family and was highly thought of at work. But the events outlined in court showed a different and darker side to the defendant’s character. During the horrific ordeal the victim was stripped of her clothes and Duggan himself fled the scene naked after a local dog walker and friends arrived on the scene in a meadow at Chertsey, Surrey. The girl was rushed battered and bleeding to St. Peter’s Hospital, Chertsey, by ambulance. In her evidence, the girl told police: 'He was trying it on. I said no and that’s what made him really angry. 'I was telling him no. He punched me and blood was coming down my face. I had no clothes on. 'All I can remember was him forcing me to perform oral sex. 'The shock made it a blur. I couldn’t believe it.' Ruby Selva, prosecuting told the . court: 'The victim had 33 separate injuries on her body and dried blood . on her face. She also had a chipped tooth.' But . despite the damning weight of evidence against him, the defendant . denied the charges, saying: 'Any sexual contact between us was . consensual.' Arrogant: Estate agent Duggan told police when he was arrested that he 'should be put in a more luxurious cell because I'm better than anyone else here' Duggan admitted beating the girl up and even offered to plead guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm in an unsuccessful plea bargain. In his defence he claimed he had lost his temper and become consumed with 'hatred' after the victim had performed a 'vile' and painful sex act upon him while they were kissing and cuddling in some grass near the Meads, Chertsey, after meeting up following a night on the town. 'I felt violated. I wanted to cause her maximum pain.' he said. But the prosecution rejected Duggan’s version of events and insisted that the real reason for the defendant’s dramatic loss of control was because the girl had rejected his advances. He was arrested the in the early morning, the day after the attack, on July 24 last year after he had helped himself to some clothes from a boat on the River Thames. He answered 'no comment' to police questions and a GP called to examine him in the police cells, Dr Paul Brigg, said he was astonished at how relaxed and care-free the defendant seemed even after having been accused of such serious offences. 'He was flippant and jokey and didn’t seem to be taking the proceedings very seriously. I found it quite extraordinary,' said Dr. Brigg. The court heard that the girl, from Surrey, had met Duggan when she had gone out drinking with her mates. Ms Selva said that several members of the group had gone to the Meads but the defendant and the girl became separated from the others. She said Duggan suddenly turned violent when the she rejected his advances. 'During the ensuing attack, he repeatedly hit her and threatened her,' said Ms Selva. But unknown to the defendant or the victim, the girl’s mobile had somehow called 999 and was on during the incident. 'It recorded some of the attack. The call was harrowing and horrific in its content. 'Throughout the incident, the complainant was fighting, crying and begging the defendant to leave her alone,' she said. Ms Selva said the phone recording was a key piece of evidence. She added: 'It captures his brutality and his crimes . 'The injuries which the victim was found to have sustained were wholly consistent with force being used.'","Victim's screams and cries for help heard after she accidentally calls 999 .

"By . Charles Walford . UPDATED: . 12:24 EST, 23 December 2011 . Andrew Watson is acknowledged as the first black international player . The unseemly incidents involving John Terry and Luis Suarez have brought the issue of racism in football to the fore again. But it is a problem almost as old as the game itself. The first black man to play international football sadly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, encountered abuse on the pitch it emerged today. Andrew Watson first played for Scotland in 1881 in a 6-1 defeat of England in London. He was captain of the side that day in a game that remains England’s heaviest defeat on home soil. He made two further international appearances, and enjoyed a highly successful club career, playing as a full back, at a time the game as we know it today was taking shape. But being a pioneer for black players on the pitch meant he was subject to abuse. Richard McBrearty, the curator of the Scottish Football Museum, told CNN: ‘What we come across in a very polite article about Watson is that he encountered ""splenetic players"" on the field. Now that suggests to me that the colour of his skin was a subject of attack. ‘That's an insight into the fact that, even in that time, this was clearly happening and Watson had to rise above that as a footballer and more widely as a human being.’ But Watson was able to maintain his dignity and apparently had a reputation as a gentleman off the pitch. ‘Certainly there is widespread praise that he wins,’ said Mr McBrearty. ‘The adoration that he has is clearly because he manages to rise above the difficulties that he encounters on the field of play.’ For a while it was believed that the first black footballer was Arthur Wharton, who played for the English team of Preston North End. But Watson pre-dates him by 11 years. Mr McBrearty told CNN that up until Pele arrived on the world stage, Watson was perhaps the most important black player in world football. Watson played three times for Scotland in the 1880s, twice against England and once against Wales . Watson was born in French Guiana in 1857 to a wealthy Scottish sugar planter Peter Miller and a local woman named Anna Rose. But  attitudes of the time meant that Watson, while enjoying financial support and a good education, was never truly acknowledged by his father. ‘Anything that had to be signed, due to school or education, was usually done through an intermediary,’ Mr McBrearty explained. ‘So he was recognised as being of the blood, but there was a distance.’ ‘He was the son of a Glasgow merchant who traded out in the West Indies and parts of South America as well. It's a story of the time, I suppose.’ He was educated at King's College School, where he excelled at sports including football.He . went on to study natural philosophy, mathematics and engineering at . University of Glasgow, before leaving, it is thought, to begin work as . an engineer. Confrontation: Chelsea captain Terry allegedly called QPR's Anton Ferdinand s 'f****** black ****' during a match. Despite the first black international playing 130 years ago, times have not moved on enough . But his love of – and talent for – football blossomed. Early . records show Watson left a club called Maxwell to join Glasgow team . Parkgrove - which at the time enjoyed a higher profile than Glasgow . Rangers. He also filled the role of  match secretary, thus creating history by being the first black football administrator. In . 1880 he joined Queen's Park, the biggest of the Glasgow clubs. He led . the team to several Scottish Cup wins, creating further history be . becoming the first black player to win a major competition. The . following year he represented Scotland in his first of three . international outings, captaining the country in the landmark 6-1 . victory over England at the Oval. Watson's . entry in the Scottish Football Association Annual of 1880–81 reads as . follows:‘Watson, Andrew: One of the very best backs we have; since . joining Queen's Park has made rapid strides to the front as a player; . has great speed and tackles splendidly; powerful and sure kick; well . worthy of a place in any representative team.’ In . November 1877 he married Jessie Nimmo Armour. Their son, Rupert, was . born the following year and a daughter, Agnes Maude, in 1880. Records show that by 1881 the family was living in Govan. A few days after his first game for . Scotland, he played again as they defeated Wales 5-1. His third and last . cap came on Scottish soil at Hampden Park, against England on 11 March . 1882. A game which ended in another 5-1 victory for Scotland. Punished: Liverpool player Luis Suarez has been handed an eight-match ban by the Football Association for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra . In 1882, he was the first black player to play in the FA Cup when he played for London club Swifts. Two years later became the first foreign player to be invited to join the Corinthians, a team that allowed only 50 members of high elite to join. Little is unknown about Watson’s later life, but he passed away in Sydney, Australia in 1902 aged 44,What is not in doubt, however, is the pioneering contribution he made to the game of football. Mr McBrearty said: ‘He's massively important to global football, not just Scottish football, not just British football. He's one of the first few pioneers. He played international football, he captained the international team and they happened to be the best there was at that time. ‘As football spreads across the globe with black players who are now among the best in the world, and you look at the legacy of fantastic Brazilian players like Pele and Garrincha, it really stems back to guys like Watson.’ In 1926 the sportswriter ‘Tityrus’ (the pen name of J.A.H. Catton, editor of the Athletic News), a man who had watched almost every England-Scotland international over the preceding 50 years, named Andrew Watson as left back in his all-time Scotland team. It was a fitting accolade for a man whose influence is still felt in the modern game.","Andrew Watson played three times for Scotland in the 1880s .

HMS Victory, the world's oldest-commissioned warship, is to be looked after at a museum with a £50m trust fund following anger over plans to turn it into a party venue. Lord Nelson's flagship vessel could have hosted private hospitality functions after the Ministry of Defence revealed it was struggling to afford the warship's £16m repair bill, but instead the HMS Victory will be 'preserved for future generations'. The 104-gun vessel, based at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, Hampshire, is to be looked after by the neighbouring National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN). In glory days: This painting by 18th Century maritime artist Francis . Swaine shows how HMS Victory looked when it was in service . Historic: The centuries-old warship will have charitable grants spent on it for the first time . The death of Lord Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Painting by Daniel Maclise . The move is aimed at ensuring the preservation of the 247-year-old vessel, as it will allow charitable grants to be spent on the ship for the first time. The announcement is accompanied by the pledge of a capital grant of £25 million from the Gosling Foundation which is to be matched by the MoD with a further £25 million. A navy spokesman said: 'This endowment totalling £50 million, with the opportunity of further charitable donations, will ensure that Victory will remain the centrepiece of the nation’s maritime heritage, continuing as a commissioned ship of the Royal Navy under her commanding officer and ship’s company.' The spokesman added that Victory will remain the flagship of the Second Sea Lord until, as previously planned, the ship is made the flagship of the First Sea Lord. The Second Sea Lord, Vice Admiral Charles Montgomery, said: 'The ship has been at the heart of the Royal Navy for centuries and is symbolic of the fighting ethos and values of the service. Dinner at the captain's table could have become a reality if Victory was hired out for private functions . These are as important and relevant in current times, for example in Afghanistan, Libya and the Gulf, as they were at the time of Trafalgar. 'I am absolutely delighted with this initiative. 'It will significantly enhance the way in which Victory can be preserved for the benefit of the nation and future generations, while retaining her links with the Royal Navy. 'She will be in the hands of an organisation which will look after her unique status and has all the professional experience that her continued and enhanced preservation requires. 'On behalf of the service, I am immensely grateful to Sir Donald Gosling and the Gosling Foundation for their generosity in making this possible.' After plans were revealed as to the potential future of the HMS Victory at the end of last month, many expressed anger that the vessel could be turned into a private hire venue. In total, HMS Victory was in service for 47 years, a period of time which has seldom been matched by any modern warship . Ministry of Defence chiefs want to offload the ship but said it cannot currently be used for advertising as it is still part of the Navy's fleet . A Royal Navy source last week: 'This is unacceptable. This historic ship should be kept by the Navy and honoured for what it did to this country. 'It is an outrage and this should not happen. If Lord Nelson knew what his prized ship was being turned into, he would turn in his grave.' But Navy bosses greeted the trust fund news. Admiral Sir Jonathon Band, chairman of the NMRN, said: 'This is fantastic news. 'The National Museum of the Royal Navy is the Navy Board’s adviser on naval heritage and therefore we are the ideal charity to oversee the trust that will be looking after this world-famous historic warship. 'The headquarters of the NMRN is adjacent to the ship on a site where there has been a naval museum presence for over 100 years and where the ship lies alongside other heritage jewels such as the Mary Rose and HMS Warrior 1860 in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Victory's decisive role came in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, under the captaincy of Vice-Admiral Nelson (above) who was fatally wounded on board during the conflict . The finishing touches to HMS Victory . were made 247 years ago in Chatham Dock before she set to sea and went . on to cover herself in glory at the Battle of Trafalgar. She . served for a total of 47 years - a period of time seldom matched by any . modern warship. The HMS Victory currently in dry dock in Portsmouth is the sixth ship to bear the name after five previous ships did so. Of these, the first two were broken up and rebuilt, two were destroyed by fire and the fifth sank in 1744. The current HMS Victory was launched in 1759 and commissioned in 1778. It . was used in two battles on the French island of Ushant in 1778 and 1780 . as well as the battle of Cape St Vincent near Portugal in 1797. However . its decisive role came in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, under the . captaincy of Vice-Admiral Nelson who was fatally wounded on board during . the conflict. The . ship was taken out of service in 1812 and remained in Portsmouth . Harbour until 1922, when it was moved into the Royal Naval Dockyard amid . fears for its deteriorating condition. 'The museum’s mission is both to educate and enhance the experience of the many millions of visitors to HMS Victory by displaying many of the artefacts relating to the ship and the Battle of Trafalgar.' Talking of the donation by the foundation in his name, Sir Donald Gosling said: 'HMS Victory is a national icon and I feel privileged that the Gosling Foundation is part of this project to ensure its future for the Royal Navy and for the nation.' Large-scale maintenance work began on Victory last year after BAE Systems Surface Ships was awarded a £16 million contract for its upkeep. A Navy spokesman said: 'The contract involves the most extensive restoration since the ship returned from the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 and has already provided a greater understanding of the material state of the ship than ever. 'This work will continue and become the responsibility of the new trust.' A 100-gun first-rate ship of the line, Victory was launched in Chatham, Kent, in 1765. But the ship will remain famous for its role in the Battle of Trafalgar 40 years later and as the place of Vice Admiral Lord Nelson’s death. However, in later life Victory was to languish as a training vessel anchored in Portsmouth Harbour until the 1920s when it was restored by the Society for Nautical Research and has since been visited by millions of sightseers from around the world.",Historic vessel to be looked after at National Museum of the Royal Navy .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 20:38 EST, 7 March 2012 . The man who killed his wife when he drunkenly fired a homemade cannonball into the trailer they shared called his brother moments after the accident to apologize. Richard Fox, 39, who is known to friends as Ricky, shot the cannon after loading it with fireworks powder. His 38-year-old wife, Jeanette Ogara Fox was found dead from shrapnel wounds when authorities arrived at the home in the small mountain community of Potrero on the Mexican border. Scene: Jeanette Ogara Fox was killed when her husband shot a makeshift cannonball into the side of the couple's mobile home . Moments after the cannon went off he phoned his brother Jerry and said: 'I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it should have been me,' according to U-T San Diego. Fox was treated at a hospital for shrapnel wounds to his right leg and arrested for investigation of exploding a device resulting in death. Three other adults and the couple's 4-year-old daughter, Vanessa, were also inside the home but escaped injury.  The girl was being looked after by her uncle, Jerry, following the explosion. Preliminary evidence suggested Fox was under the influence of alcohol, San Diego County sheriff's Sgt. David Martinez said. Investigators are yet to establish a motive or determine if the blast was accidental. Fox and his friend were supposedly working on the cannon nearby when it went off, and at least one of the men was at the scene when police arrived. A place called Potrero: 38-year-old Jeanette died in her mobile home parked in the Potrero mountain community on the Mexican border . He said that he made the cannonball, and even admitted to lighting the weapon just before it went off around 12.15am. John Arnold, a neighbor, told U-T San Diego that Fox worked as a handyman and lived in the home for about six years. 'He liked experimenting with guns, and it looks like this experiment went bad,' he told the newspaper. he added that Fox 'adores Jeanette and Vanessa. They mean the world to him. I can’t imagine how he feels right now. He probably doesn’t want to live.' The couple are apparently well known in the community, largely because of Fox's striking looks - his is tall, thin and tattooed. Brother Jerry Fox, of Redding, told the newspaper that Fox 'likes to live on the edge. 'He is one of those people who likes to take things apart and put things back together and likes to see how things work.' Unusual: Unlike the cannonball seen above, the one used the incident was made by the two men and was not an antique, but it was still very harmful .","Richard Fox, 39, arrested by San Diego police officers .

French First Lady Carla Bruni fears her husband could 'drop dead through overwork' if he wins a second five-year term as President. Bruni told viewers on live TV that 56-year-old Nicolas Sarkozy's '20-hour working days' and 'unimaginable sense of duty' could eventually kill him. The former supermodel, 44, said: 'I'm afraid for him. I'm afraid for his health. Sense of duty: French First Lady Carla Bruni mops her husband Nicolas Sarkozy's brow as they visit a market in Fort-de-France in January. She fears he could work himself to death . Workaholic: Sarkozy and Bruni meet David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, outside 10 Downing Street on an official visit in June 2010. Bruni says her husband pushes himself too hard . 'It might seem crazy, but because he gives so much of himself he doesn't look after himself at all. 'He has an unimaginable sense of duty that he brings home to the house in the evenings, which is there all the time. 'He never stops, he never lets up, he works all the time. He works, I don't know, 20 hours a day. 'So I'm frightened that he'll die, all of a sudden, because he's pushing himself too hard.' Running out of steam? Sarkozy collapsed while jogging in July 2009, a health scare some say was triggered by a gruellling fitness regime encouraged by Bruni (centre) Bruni said last year that she believed a single term in office was enough for her 'superhuman husband', who has already had one health scare during his first term in office. He is now bidding for a second term as president in the election in May. Bruni added during the interview on France 5 television today: 'I realise it's part of the job, but I don't think everyone would do what he does. Few people have his energy.' In a interview earlier this week, Sarkozy vowed to quit politics if he loses the election in two months' time. On the mend: The French President leaves hospital, escorted by his wife, in July 2009 where he was treated following his collapse . He told listeners on RMC radio: 'I'll do something else, although what, I don't know what yet. But I will fight with all my energy to have the French people renew their confidence in me.' A month earlier, the French leader said he would 'rather become a monk' than return to politics if he does not win. Asked about her husband's plans to quit if he is defeated, Bruni added: 'What do you expect him to do after being President of France? Become a minister again? Become a mayor? 'He just couldn't. He'd have to leave politics.' Sarkozy's last health scare was in July 2009 when he was rushed to hospital after collapsing while jogging. Doctors conducted neurological, blood and cardiological tests before stating he had been suffering from 'extreme fatigue'. The French media and Sarkozy's close friends all suggested at the time that it was his gruellling fitness regime encouraged by Bruni that lead to the collapse. She put him on a strict diet after their marriage in 2008 and introduced him to her fitness instructor, who told him to lose 9lb and two trouser sizes - which some doctors said was excessive in a man who is only 5ft 5ins tall. His close friend and MP Patrick Balkany said the regime made the president look like 'a Tour de France cyclist'.","Sarkozy wants second term as French President .

But two British badminton stars could be accused of ungentlewomanly conflict after a war of words in the run up to the Olympics. Glaswegian Imogen Bankier, 24, and Bolton-born Jenny Wallwork, 25, are both competing for one mixed doubles spot this summer. Feud: Olympic badminton rivals Imogen Bankier (left) and Jenny Wallwork (right) have been serving up insults on Twitter as they compete for a place at the Games . The flare-up started on Wednesday after Miss Bankier watched TV highlights of the English National Championships. She tweeted: ‘Just watched the English nationals… why can English people not serve?!’ She insisted it had been ‘meant in a light-hearted way – not to offend’ after Gabby White, Miss Wallwork’s women’s doubles partner, called her ‘sour’. Two days later, Miss Wallwork launched her own attack, making a thinly veiled reference to her rival’s injury record. Gets heated: Bolton-born Miss Wallwork hits back at Miss Bankier's claims that the English can't serve (top) to which the Glaswegian tells her not to say something she will regret . ‘So the one with the ‘lighthearted banter’ is injured AGAIN!,’ she said. ‘I’d go for the ropey serve any day ;-) #banter’, and ‘Could have guessed to be honest, your [sic] usually crippled. #weak.’ The Scotswoman responded that the meaning of banter was ‘playful, intelligent, original’, adding ‘calling me a cripple… none of the above. #jog on #bored.’ She also warned her rival to not to ‘say something you regret’, followed by the word ‘spite’. Undeterred, Miss Wallwork retaliated: . ‘Slating English players none of the above either. I suggest u keep your . ‘banter’ to yourself or ‘jog on’ back to Scotland.’ Vying for 2012: Miss Bankier (left) and mixed-doubles partner Chris Adcock (right) are 14th in the world rankings .

Miss Bankier and her mixed doubles partner Chris Adcock are currently 14th in the world and have the edge over Miss Wallwork and her partner Nathan Robertson, in 18th place. Whichever team is ranked higher in May, is likely to be selected for the GB squad. The Glasgow-born player, who is sponsored by a whisky firm, has previously spoken out against the Badminton World Federation’s plan to force female players to wear short skirts. The BWF claimed the move was aimed at ‘raising badminton’s profile and that of women players’, but she hit back, saying: ‘I will fight to make sure this dated and simply sexist rule does not happen.’ She started playing badminton at the age of nine in what she describes as ‘very competitive Bankier family games in the back garden’. Her competitor Miss Wallwork has also played badminton since she was a child. Her mother, Jill, played for England, while her father Brian was a badminton coach. When Miss Wallwork paired up with Mr Robertson, 34, in 2008, he joked that he had ‘upgraded to a younger model’ after his long-term doubles partner Gail Emms retired from the sport.","Glaswegian Imogen Bankier: 'Why can English people not serve?!'

"UPDATED: . 13:09 EST, 12 September 2011 . Ritesh Brahmbhatt: A crooked solicitor who smuggled drugs and mobile phones into two prisons in his hugely oversized shoes is facing years behind bars . A crooked solicitor who smuggled drugs and mobile phones into two prisons by hiding them in his oversized shoes is facing years behind bars. Ritesh Brahmbhatt, 31, was caught out by sniffer dogs as he entered north London's Pentonville jail in size 12, wide-fitting shoes stuffed with contraband. A search found that he was carrying three-inch packages containing skunk, . the illegal stimulant 'meow meow' and even electronic scales in his slip-ons. The lawyer was planning to pass the items to inmate David Sterling, 28, who was wearing a full-length Muslim robe. Blackfriars Crown Court had heard how the black, metal-buckled slip-ons  three sizes too big for Brahmbhatt were purchased just days before in a branch of High and Mighty, which specialises in outsize menswear. Brahmbhatt, who is currently . suspended by the Solicitors' Regulation Authority, admitted two plots . between March 1 and September 17, 2009. He also admitted a further charge of . conveying a mobile phone into Winchester prison while on bail for those . offences, on February 2 this year. Jurors heard evidence he had been . planning another smuggling operation just five months after he was . caught the first time, and returned to the same shop to put in an . order for more massive shoes. Prison officer Lucy McLaren noticed Brahmbhatt's suspiciously high . number of legal visits to Sterling and arranged a surprise sniffer dog operation. Ms McLaren said: 'He came up the . stairs towards and looked shocked to see we were doing a search as they . would normally be done out-of-hours. 'I told him we were going to be conducting a dog search on all visitors and there would be a slight delay. 'He went very pale and started to pat his jacket pockets as though he'd forgotten something.' Accomplices: Danielle Porter (left) and Desmond Brown were convicted of conspiracy to convey articles including drugs, mobile phones and components into prison . The handlers told the officer both . dogs had given their signal that he 'had been near or was in possession . of a controlled substance'. She said that when she told Brahmbatt . he was embarrassed: . She said: 'He asked me to close the door so that none of . his colleagues could see that he was being held. 'Mr Brahmbhatt at first didn't want to remove his shoes, . 'However eventually he took them off. There were two packages inside his shoes. His right shoes held a clingfilm package containing a . mobile phone, earphones and accessories, a pair of electronic scales and . a small quantity of mephedrone, commonly known as meow meow. A second package containing 25g of skunk cannabis was found in his left shoe. Officers also found 27g of skunk and 53g of cannabis in his trousers. Prisoner Desmond Brown, 26, his girlfriend Danielle Porter, 24, and 26-year-old Calvin Chance were involved with the operation alongside Sterling and Brahmbhat. Caught out: A search found three-inch packages containing skunk, 'meow meow' and electronic scales in his slip on shoes (file picture) Nearly £20,000 passed through bank accounts belonging to Brahmbhatt, Porter, and two others before the racket was smashed. Rufuz D'Cruz, prosecuting, said: 'Ritesh Brahmbhatt entered into a crude criminal conspiracy to smuggle prohibited items into prison with his clients, Sterling and Brown, who at that time were serving prisoners, and Chance and Porter. 'Over that six month period in 2009, Brahmbhatt, Chance and Porter worked on the outside, covertly conveying into prison drugs, mobile phones and mobile phone parts, during the course of a series of visits to both Sterling and Brown.' Brahmbhatt who worked for Holloway law firm Mordi and Co, had 'abused his position of trust' as a lawyer to use legal visits to bring in items in return for cash bungs. Sterling and Brown, Bromley-by-Bow, east London, Porter, of, Barking, Essex, and Chance, Leytonstone, east London, all denied two charges of conspiracy to convey articles including drugs, mobile phones and components into prison and were unanimously convicted. Brahmbhatt, of Ilford, admitted two conspiracies, each relating to drugs and phones, in to prison, and a further charge of conveying a mobile phone into Winchester prison. They are all awaiting sentencing.","Ritesh Brahmbhatt, 31, caught out by sniffer dogs as he walked into Pentonville in huge slip-ons ."
"By . Sadie Whitelocks . UPDATED: . 07:28 EST, 17 January 2012 . Millions of lives are at risk because of fake and substandard anti-malarial drugs, say experts. Counterfeit medicines circulated by criminals could endanger patients and promote drug resistance among malaria parasites they warned. The latest study funded by the Wellcome Trust calls for public authorities to take immediate action help tackle one of the world's deadliest diseases. A study warns counterfeit medicines could endanger patients and promote drug resistance among malaria parasites . Researchers investigated fake and poor quality anti-malarial drugs sold in 11 African countries between 2002 and 2010. Some of the counterfeits . were found to contain a mixture of incorrect pharmaceutical ingredients which would . initially alleviate the symptoms of malaria but not cure it. Worse still, some of the ingredients could cause potentially serious side effects, particularly if combined with other medication that the patient was taking, such as anti-retroviral treatments for HIV. Lead researcher Dr Paul Newton said: 'The enormous investment in the . development, evaluation and deployment of anti-malarials is wasted if . the medicines that patients actually take are, due to criminality or . carelessness, of poor quality and do not cure.' 'Malaria can be readily treated with the right drugs of good quality, but poor quality medicines, as well as increasing mortality and morbidity, risk exacerbating the economic and social impact of malaria on societies that are already poor.' A 2009 study found 450,000 people died annually from fake malaria treatment . It was discovered that some of the fakes, believed to have originated in China, contain small quantities of . artemisinin derivatives - one of the most effective . drugs used to treat malaria. It is thought that this addition is so counterfeit . products pass authenticity tests. At this low level scientists warn that instead of destroying malaria parasites, the tablets could enable the body to build up a resistance to anti-malarial drugs. This problem occurs with anti-malarials, and as a result the World Health Organisation encourages . artemisinins to be used in combination with other drugs, to . delay resistance developing. The researchers, from the Wellcome . Trust-Mahosot Hospital-Oxford University Tropical Medicine Research . Collaboration, published their work in the Malaria Journal. Malaria is believed to kill around . 800,000 people a year, mainly young children and pregnant women and is . caused by parasites injected into the bloodstream by mosquitoes. Dr Newton has called for urgent measures from African governments to tackle counterfeit anti-malarials. He added: 'Failure to take action will put at risk the lives of millions of people, particularly children and pregnant women.' In 2001, police in Guangzhou, China, arrested Nigerian and Chinese men for production of counterfeits of the anti-malarial halofantrine and production facilities for packaging materials for counterfeit anti-malarials have been seized in Nigeria. Meanwhile a 2009 study by International Policy Network found approximately 450,000 people died annually from fake malaria treatments, most of which originated from China and India.","Counterfeit medicine circulated by criminals .

They met Kate and William in the . chemotherapy room where they posed for photos and chatted about their . lives and their treatment. Prince William and Kate made the . visit to the Surrey hospital six months ago - almost 30 years after . Princess Diana toured the hospital on her first solo engagement in 1982. William is president of the Royal . Marsden - the first hospital in the world dedicated to cancer treatment . and research into the causes of the disease. Tragic loss: Beth was diagnosed with Ewings Sarcoma in 2010, but had set herself the target of raising £100,000 for charity . The Royal Marsden is a cancer centre specialising in diagnosis, treatment, research and education . Moving visit: Kate and William arriving at the Royal Marsden . He took over from his mother, who took on the role in 1989 until her death in 1997. During the visit, both William and Kate chatted animatedly to the patients in the hospital’s new £18million Oak Centre for Children and Young People. Amanda’s mother June, 55, from Maidstone, Kent, told the Daily Mirror: 'Amanda was absolutely ecstatic at meeting the Duke and Duchess. 'Rubbing shoulders with royalty was the highlight of her life and it gave her a huge boost.' Beth, from Portslade, in Brighton, was also pictured chatting to a relaxed-looking Duchess. Her father, David, was with her when she met the royals. He said: 'She fought her illness bravely right until the end. The most I will miss about her was the openness we shared and her dry sense of humour. I am very proud of her.' Beth’s mother, Deena, added: 'No one could have fought harder and went through so much. She was beautiful, brave, loving and my best friend, I was so proud to be her mum.' Beth had become an ambassador for Teenage Cancer Trust. She had set herself a fundraising target of £10,000. Her family and friends hope to reach that target in her memory. The Royal Marsden was founded as the Free Cancer Hospital in 1851 by Dr William Marsden. Marsden, affected by the death of his wife Elizabeth Ann from cancer, resolved to classify tumours, research the causes and find new treatments. The hospital at first consisted solely of a dispensary, providing palliative drugs, but it allowed William Marsden the opportunity to study and research the disease. The hospital was granted its Royal Charter of Incorporation by King George V in 1910 and became known as The Cancer Hospital (Free). This was changed by King Edward VIII to include the word ‘Royal’ and in 1954 the hospital was renamed The Royal Marsden Hospital in recognition of its founder.

Jean-Claude Baumgartner, 50, duped . the Dragons into handing over the cash with false promises of a business that would create a ‘satnav for skiers’. Mr Baumgartner managed to swindle the money with a business plan that was backed up by fake emails and letters. Judge Aidan Marron QC, sitting at . Blackfriars Crown Court, said: ‘The fact remains that you have been . responsible for persistent dishonesty. 'You may well in fact have . intended to operate a legitimate business but the means that you chose . to establish that business were in my judgement thoroughly dishonest. ‘You lied about the ownership of . crucial equipment which was pivotal to your pitch on TV. 'You created a . wholly false trail of documents to deceive well intentioned people. ‘You have lied so many times about so many features that in my judgement I am entitled to regard that as an aggravating feature. ‘It is clear to me that from an early . stage you were redirecting monies and indeed appropriating funds for . your own purposes, you were responsible for a number of different frauds . within that main fraud.’ But Baumgartner blamed the failure of . the business to take off by claiming he had not received the support, . advice and expertise the Dragons had promised.

"By . Rebecca English Royal Correspondent In Montego Bay . UPDATED: . 07:45 EST, 12 March 2012 . Prince Harry has had a secret adviser during his hugely successful tour of the Caribbean – his brother, the Duke of Cambridge. The two Princes have been texting each other and talking on the phone throughout the past week, with the Duke - who is currently on deployment with the RAF in the Falklands - giving his brother tips on how to strike the right balance of formality and fun. Yesterday Prince Harry rounded off his visit to Jamaica, the last stop on his tour of Commonwealth realms to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, by attending a beach party on a tiny island off Montego Bay.

Dressed casually in an open-necked blue linen shirt, navy blue trousers and brown suede boots, the 27-year-old watched a show of Jamaican dance and music before mingling with invited guests including three holders of the Miss Jamaica title. During the beach party at the Sandals Royal Caribbean resort, the Prince tapped his feet and nodded to the rhythms, and at one point mouthed the words of the Bob Marley hit Three Little Birds as a violinist played the tune. He was also presented with a blend of 30-year-old Jamaican rum, with another bottle for his brother. The Duke has been giving his brother tips on how to strike the right balance of formality and fun . His week-long tour of Belize, the Bahamas and Jamaica has been widely lauded as a tour de force and has garnered rave reviews both at home and abroad. Harry, who has often been the subject of less flattering headlines, is said to feel hugely encouraged by the welcome he has received and the way the visit has been portrayed. 'He is the first to admit that he wouldn't be suited to a more formal royal tour but this trip has had a hugely relaxed vibe to it and Prince Harry has tried to play to his strengths,' a source close to the prince said. Another senior source said Prince William had also played a part in Harry’s sure-footed handling of the more formal parts of the tour. 'He spoke at length to his brother before coming out, about how to approach it, and they have been in communication throughout the tour,' they said. 'They have been in touch regularly via mobile and text. The relationship they have full of banter and humour but Prince William is deeply caring of his younger brother and wants his younger brother succeed. 'He can advise him on how to mix the informality with the dignity of [representing] the Queen.' As . well as being aware that his brother was watching how he performed, .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:30 EST, 11 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:00 EST, 12 March 2012 . NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has landed robotic explorers on the surface of Mars, sent probes to outer planets and operates a worldwide network of antennas that communicates with interplanetary spacecraft. The agency's latest mission is defending itself in a workplace lawsuit it landed last year, filed by a former computer specialist who claims he was demoted - and then let go - for promoting his views on intelligent design. David Coppedge claims he was discriminated against because of his belief that a higher power must have had a hand in creation, because life is too complex to have developed through evolution alone. Dismissed: David Coppedge claims he was discriminated against when he was fired from his post on the Cassini Mission last year . Mr Coppedge, who worked as a 'team lead' on the Cassini mission exploring Saturn and its many moons, alleges he was sacked because he engaged his co-workers in conversations about intelligent design and handed out DVDs on the idea while at work. He lost his 'team lead' title in 2009 and was let go last year after 15 years on the mission. Opening statements are expected to begin Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court after two years of legal wrangling in a case that has generated interest among supporters of intelligent design. The Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian civil rights group, and the Discovery Institute, a proponent of intelligent design, are both supporting Mr Coppedge's case. 'It's part of a pattern. There is basically a war on anyone who dissents from Darwin and we've seen that for several years,' said John West, associate director of Center for Science and Culture at the Seattle-based Discovery Institute. 'This is free speech, freedom of conscience 101.' Lawsuit: David Coppedge worked as a 'team lead' on the Cassini mission exploring Saturn and its many moons before being demoted in 2009 and sacked last year . The National Center for Science Education, which rejects intelligent design as thinly veiled creationism, is also watching the case and has posted all the legal filings on its website. 'It would be unfortunate if the court took what seems to be a fairly straightforward employment law case and allowed it to become this tangled mess of trying to adjudicate scientific matters,' said Josh Rosenau, NCSE's programs and policy director. 'It looks like a pretty straightforward case. The mission that he was working on was winding down and he was laid off.' Mr Coppedge's attorney, William Becker, says his client was singled out by his bosses because they perceived his belief in intelligent design to be religious. His client had a reputation around JPL as an evangelical Christian and other interactions with co-workers led some to label him as a Christian conservative, Mr Becker said. NASA: The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California has landed robotic explorers on the surface of Mars and sent probes to outer planets . In the lawsuit, Mr Coppedge says he believes other things also led to his demotion, including his support for a state ballot measure that sought to define marriage as limited to heterosexual couples and his request to rename the annual holiday party a 'Christmas party.' 'David had this reputation for being a Christian, for being a practicing one. He did not go around evangelising or proselytising. But if he found out that someone was a Christian he would say, ""Oh that's interesting, what denomination are you?""' Becker said. 'He's not apologising for who he is. He's an evangelical Christian.' In an emailed statement, JPL dismissed Mr Coppedge's claims. In court papers, lawyers for the California Institute of Technology, which manages JPL for NASA, said Mr Coppedge received a written warning because his co-workers complained of harassment. They also said Mr Coppedge lost his 'team lead' status because of ongoing conflicts with others. Caltech lawyers contend Mr Coppedge was one of two Cassini technicians and among 246 JPL employees let go last year due to planned budget cuts. Space agency: David Coppedge began working for JPL as a contractor in 1996 and was hired in 2003 . While . the case has attracted interest because of the controversial nature of . intelligent design, it is at its heart a straightforward discrimination . case, said Eugene Volokh, a professor of First Amendment law at the . University of California, Los Angeles School of Law. 'The . question is whether the plaintiff was fired simply because he was . wasting people's time and bothering them in ways that would have led him . to being fired regardless of whether it was about religion or whether . he was treated worse based on the religiosity of his beliefs,' said Mr . Volokh. 'If he can show that, then he's got a good case.' Mr Coppedge, who began working for JPL as a contractor in 1996 and was hired in 2003, is active in the intelligent design sphere and runs a website that interprets scientific discoveries through the lens of intelligent design. His father authored an anti-evolution book and founded a Christian outreach group. He is also a board member for Illustra Media, a company that produces video documentaries examining the scientific evidence for intelligent design. The company produces the videos that Mr Coppedge was handing out to co-workers, said Becker, his attorney. His main duties at JPL were to maintain computer networks and troubleshoot technical problems for the mission. In 2000, he was named 'team lead', serving as a liaison between technicians and managers for nearly a decade before being demoted in 2009. He sued in April 2010 alleging religious discrimination, retaliation and harassment and amended his suit to include wrongful termination after losing his job last year. Mr Coppedge is seeking attorney's fees and costs, damages for wrongful termination and a statement from the judge that his rights were violated, said Mr Becker.",David Coppedge claims he was unfairly dismissed for his beliefs about evolution .
"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 15:40 EST, 5 January 2012 . We know how the Mayans built astonishing temples in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras - but now it's been suggested some fled their dissolving civilisation and may have even ended up in Atlanta. Historian and author Richard Thornton believes a 1,100-year-old archaeological site shows that peasants fled Central America and ended up in the North Georgian mountains near Blairsville. His astonishing theory is based on the discovery of 300 to 500 rock terraces and mounds on the side of Brasstown Bald mountain that date to 800AD - around the time the Mayans began to die out. Ruins: Carey Waldrip shows the many mysterious rock pile terraces near the Arkaquah Trail in Brasstown Baid, Georgia. The mounds are possibly tied to a Mayan civilisation and have become an internet sensation . Georgia Mountain: The theory revolves around an area near Brasstown Bald mountain, pictured, potentially being the 'fabled city of Yupaha, which Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto failed to find in 1540' But not everyone is impressed by Mr Thornton’s theory. He cited University of Georgia archaeology professor Mark Williams in an article in the Examiner, reported the Atlanta Journal Constitution. ‘I am the archaeologist Mark Williams mentioned in this article,’ Professor Williams said on Facebook. ‘This is total and complete bunk. There is no evidence of Maya in Georgia. Move along now.’ However Professor Williams’s comments on the Examiner article have themselves caused a backlash as other readers labelled his dismissive words as ‘pompous’, ‘arrogant’ and ‘disrespectful’. The professor responded by telling the Atlanta Journal Constitution: ‘There’s a feeling that people are hiding the truth. Someone needed to stand up and say: “This is silly”.’ Look at this: The remains were first found by retired engineer Carey Waldrip, pictured, when he went walking in the area in the 1990s .

A teenager on probation told police he struck his girlfriend’s young son Friday night after the boy wouldn’t stop crying, resulting in the toddler's death. Tyree Wright, 19, who was arrested five times before for assault and robbery charges, reportedly told police that while babysitting 23-month-old Jacquil Degraffenreid for his girlfriend, he struck the boy twice. The boy’s mother, 21-year-old Natalie Garner received a call from Wright around 9pm Friday night to say that her son was sick. Scene: Tyree Wright, 19 reportedly told police that while babysitting 23-month-old Jacquil Degraffenreid for his girlfriend, he struck the boy twice at his Brooklyn home . Ms Garner had apparently left her son in Wright’s care while she went to work at her catering job. By the time she returned to Wright’s home on Shepard Avenue in Cypress Hills around 2am, she told police that Jaquil was acting sluggishly and lost consciousness, the New York Post reported. That’s when Ms Garner called 911, sources told the paper. Jaquil was taken to Kings County Hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival. The autopsy report says his cause of death was caused by ‘lacerations of the liver and pancreas with internal hemorrhage due to blunt-impact injuries.’ Authorities are still investigating what caused the toddler’s injuries. Tragic: The boy was taken to Kings County Hospital, where he was pronounced dead; an autopsy report said he died from internal bleeding and cuts to his liver and pancreas . Doctors told police they also found bruising on the boy’s forehead and torso. Wright was charged with felony assault and acting in a manner injurious to a child, though it is likely that the charges will be upped to murder, a spokesman for the Kings County district attorney’s office told the New York Times. Records show he was jailed in both 2009 and 2011. He was on probation until 2014 for robbery, CBS New York said. Neighbours were devastated when they heard the news. ‘It broke my heart in pieces, a little boy suffering like that,’ neighbour Ivan Sanchez told the Post. ‘He’s evil,’ Mr Sanchez added. ‘I hope he gets what he deserves.’","Tyree Wright, 19, on probation for robbery charge .

A former Los Angeles police detective was found guilty today of the 26-year-old murder of the wife of her former lover in a case that hinged on a single piece of evidence - DNA from a bite mark on the victim's arm. Stephanie Lazarus, 51, of Los Angeles, beat and shot dead Sherri Rasmussen, 29, in February 1986 . after her lover John Reutten wed the hospital nursing director instead . of her. The first-degree murder conviction came after a three-week trial that included testimony from a forensic expert who said the DNA was a match to defendant Lazarus. Shock: Stephanie Lazarus (right) listens as she is found guilty of first-degree murder in Los Angeles today as her attorney Mark Overland (left) turns away . Shattered: Lazarus's attorney lays a hand on her back after she is found guilty today of killing the wife of her former lover Sherri Rasmussen . Her defense attorney countered that the . DNA was packaged improperly and deteriorated while stored in a coroner's . freezer for two decades. He also suggested there might have been . evidence tampering. The case was submitted to jurors on Tuesday after intense closing arguments by both sides. After a day and a half of deliberation, the panel of eight women and four men delivered its decision. Victim Sherri Rasmussen was bludgeoned and shot to death in 1986 in the condo she shared with her husband of three months. Detectives initially believed two robbers who had attacked another woman in the area were to blame. But two decades later, a cold case team using DNA analysis concluded the killer was a woman and authorities began looking at Lazarus as a suspect. During the trial, prosecutors focused on the relationship of Lazarus and John Ruetten, who became her lover after they graduated from college. Love triangle: John Reutten, right, married former hospital nursing director Sherri Rasmussen, 29, left, before Stephanie Lazarus, 51, killed her in 1986 . He testified that he never intended to . marry Lazarus, although they were intimate for about a year. He also . said she enticed him into having sex with her shortly before his . wedding. 'Here's the deal,' he testified. 'It was clear she was very upset that I was getting married and moving on.' 'Heaven has no . rage like love to hatred turned, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.' Prosecutor Shannon Presby . Lazarus' lawyer, Mark Overland, ridiculed the claim of a fatal attraction between Lazarus and Ruetten, saying she never tried to reunite with her former lover after his wife was gone. 'So this obsessing with John must have fizzled out I guess,' he said. Shocking close-up death pictures of the . battered face of Mrs Rasmussen were presented to jurors during the trial of . Lazarus, showing one eye swollen shut and the other wide open. Mrs Rasmussen's mouth was open wide, her . hands held up as if in a defensive posture. Fatal jealousy: Sherri Rasmussen (pictured left) was brutally murdered by LAPD detective Stephanie Lazarus (right) in 1986 . Justice: Neil and Loretta Rasmussen, parents of Sherri, who was beaten and shot in 1986 . Lazarus went on to marry another . policeman and adopt a daughter. She rose in the ranks of the Los Angeles . Police Department, becoming a detective in charge of art forgeries and . thefts. Overland also pointed to the lack of physical evidence against her. No blood, fingerprints, hair or fibers connected her to the scene. But prosecutor Shannon Presby told jurors the case was based on more than just DNA. At the outset of the trial, he said it featured 'a bite, a bullet, a gun barrel and a broken heart'. Convicted: Lazarus married another policeman and adopted a daughter . He said a bite on Mrs Rasmussen's arm . contained saliva that was matched to Lazarus's DNA more than two decades . after the killing. Lazarus' gun was never found, but Mr Presby called experts to testify that bullets fired into Rasmussen's body matched those issued to police officers in 1986. Mr Presby drove home the idea in his closing . argument with a familiar line from poet William Congreve: 'Heaven has no . rage like love to hatred turned, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.' Lazarus' husband attended most of the trial along with other family members. Ruetten sat across the courtroom with Rasmussen's family. The defendant and her white-haired former boyfriend never looked at each other. But their past moved before them on screen as both sides showed pictures of them as a young couple. Among the trial's most dramatic moments came when Ruetten testified tearfully about finding his wife slain. He said it never entered his mind that Lazarus might be responsible. Last month, Rasmussen family lawyer John Taylor said: ‘It took 26 years to get here finally. The family is pleased to get the trial going.' It was the first time in living memory that an active-duty LAPD officer was arrested on a murder charge and later convicted, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Damilola Taylor’s father demanded a public inquiry yesterday after one of his son’s killers was recalled to jail – only 16 days after being freed. Ricky Preddie was arrested on Thursday night after entering a South London estate to meet up with fellow gang members, breaching the terms of his release. It is the second time he has been released then recalled for breaking the conditions of his licence. He is now likely to stay behind bars until his tariff expires in May 2013. Back in jail: Ricky Preddie (left) was released . from . Pentonville prison but was last night recalled for breaching the terms . of his licence. He had served five years for the killing of Damilola . Taylor (right) Preddie was originally released in September 2010 but sent back to jail last March for breaking the conditions of his licence . Ten-year-old Damilola bled to death after being stabbed with a broken bottle on a council estate in Peckham, South London, in November 2000, as he walked home from the local library after school. He had moved to Britain from Nigeria only a few months before. Preddie, now 24, was first released in 2010, four years into an eight-year sentence. Only six months later he was recalled after returning to the Peckham estates he terrorised as a boy in breach of his licence. On January 25 this year, he was freed a second time. Police were alerted after he was seen in Southwark, where he was thought to be associating with gang members. Yesterday Damilola’s father Richard said he was planning to write to the Prime Minister calling for an inquiry into how ‘the system has failed so badly in this case’. He said: ‘I am very angry with the Parole Board for the way they handled this and the way they have ignored my advice.’ Mr Taylor, 64, had previously pleaded with the authorities not to release Ricky Preddie or his brother Danny, both of whom were jailed for eight years for Damilola’s manslaughter in 2006. Danny was released last September. Mr Taylor has said the pair should be hanged. After Ricky’s second release, he said: ‘He has not served enough time behind bars for what he did. ‘He has not had the opportunity to reflect on what he has done and it is obvious he will return to criminality.’ Gary Trowsdale, managing director of the Damilola Taylor Trust, said: ‘For the second time in 18 months, the boy has been recalled due to breaking the terms of his licence. Neither of these boys has shown any remorse. ‘Every time this happens the Damilola family are being dragged back through all the pain.’ Heartache: Damilola's father Richard, with his late wife Gloria, who died in 2008.

A Desperate Housewives producer revealed an upcoming plot twist as they announced one of the major characters will be killed off in an episode airing in America this Sunday. George Perkins let slip that it will be James Denton's character Mike Delfino who dies in the upcoming episode. Coincidentally, the revelation came less than an hour after Denton took to the stand in the ongoing legal battle between his show's creator Marc Cherry and his former co-star Nicollette Sheridan. Suits you, madam! Nicollette Sheridan arrived at court in L.A today looking as sharp and elegant as always . Denton says the death of Sheridan's . character on Desperate Housewives wasn't shocking to him because the . series has featured so many characters who have been killed off. Denton testified briefly today during . the trial, saying he was also unaware of Sheridan's allegations that . series creator Marc Cherry had hit her until months after the incident. The actor, who rehearsed and . shot with Sheridan the day of her dispute with Cherry, told the jury he . didn't learn of Britt's death until he received a script detailing it . the following year. 'I can't say I was shocked, only because people get killed so often,' he testified. Not shocked: James Denton testified that there was nothing off about Sheridan's exit . The actor was called by defence lawyers for Cherry, but Denton says he doubts his testimony 'helped or hurt anybody.' He also said fittingly: '(The show) changes so quickly that we always joke that nobody’s safe.' He told jurors he has great affection for both Sheridan and Cherry. Denton, who plays Mike Delfino and other Housewives actors are currently filming the final shows of series. He plays the husband of Teri Hatcher's . character, Susan, but during their long-term story arc he was involved . with Sheridan's character, Edie Britt, and therefore worked closely with . her. Sheridan's role was killed off in . season five and she claims it was in retaliation for her complaint that . Cherry hit her, which the writer and executive producer denies. Anger didn't factor into the decision to kill off Sheridan's role, the series creator testified today. Marc Cherry concluded his testimony in . the actress' wrongful termination case by denying claims by Sheridan's . attorneys that he tried to influence the statements of other employees . on the show to fit his version of the dispute. Cherry and other witnesses have said . approval to kill off Sheridan's character Edie Britt was given in May . 2008, four months before the actress accused Cherry of striking her hard . in the head during a discussion of a scene. Cherry testified that he was simply trying to convey some direction to the actress on how to use physical humour. Co-stars: Denton was filming with Sheridan on the day of the alleged head-tapping incident, but claims he only knew about it months later . She wears it well: Sheridan has a different couture suit for her each day, the actress certainly knows how to work a stage . Sheridan, 48, told jurors last week . she was stunned and humiliated by the blow, which she described as a . wallop, and that Cherry appeared nervous when he informed her in . February 2009 that her character was going to die. Jurors have been presented plenty of evidence about the many deaths of Desperate Housewives. They are frequently told 48 characters . have been killed on the series, and were shown a montage of the various . methods, including beatings, shootings, car crashes, stabbings and in . Britt's case, electrocution. Denton agreed with Sheridan's attorney that Britt was the most prominent character to be killed off. 'They were relieved': Marc Cherry has said that Eva Longoria and Felicity Huffman were happy to learn Sheridan was getting axed from the show . He and other actors are currently . filming the final episodes of the series and the case has been talked . about on the set. 'It's really disappointing for us,' Denton said. Denton's testimony provided more star . power to the case but didn't contribute to mounting conflicting evidence . jurors will have to sift through when testimony concludes next week. The actress' attorneys have suggested . that Cherry and other Desperate Housewives workers altered their stories . about the timing of the decision to kill off Britt. More details to come: Sheridan's attorneys called Cherry as . the trial's second witness, and he is adamant that he did not axe her in retaliation for any complaint . Scene of the showdown: Sheridan and Cherry are battling it out at the Los Angeles Superior Court . The veteran TV writer denied their . claims Thursday, saying he made no efforts to influence a long list of . other people who worked on the show. Cherry and two witnesses say top ABC . executives gave approval in May 2008, although a former writer and . co-executive producer testified Wednesday that she didn't hear any . discussions about killing off Britt until December 2008. The show, which started to much fanfare and praise in 2004 is in its final season. Battle: Sheridan . took to the stand on Friday and claimed that Cherry deliberately didn't . give her character any funny lines . Giving evidence: Court papers show the names of stars from Desperate Housewives who will be called for the defense . Written out: Sheridan's character Edie Britt was killed off in 2009 when her character was electrocuted following a car crash . No research: Potential jurors were told not to watch Desperate . Housewives at the end of day two in the Nicollette Sheridan versus Marc . Cherry legal battle . They're more likely to be found around an achingly trendy pool, or being fitted with impractical shoes on Rodeo Drive... but Nicollette and Lindsay Lohan have become pioneers of an unlikely legal chic trend. And while they may not have wanted to appear in court in the first place, 25-year-old Lindsay perhaps more vehemently than Nicollette, they'll be damned if they don't use the opportunity as a showcase. L.A law: Lindsay Lohan and Nicollette both bring the same kind of platinum blonde starlet glamour to their appearances at court in California . And so they should, both starlets found themselves in the drama keg that is a courtroom at a time when their careers were nothing short of moribund. It's given Lohan's career CPR, being reprimanded so publicly while she pouts like the starlet the world never knew it wanted until now, and it could revive Sheridan's prospects if she plays her cards right. Whatever happens, both platinum blondes have looked spectacular in tailored clothes and vertiginous pumps that never veered towards stripper territory. These unfortunate sets of circumstances have given two great actresses, who lost their way for various reasons, a chance to shine again... albeit on an unlikely stage.","Came after James Denton took to the stand to say he wasn't 'shocked' by Sheridan's departure .

Business Secretary Vince Cable hit out at the Government’s controversial charity tax last night saying the move could strip leading universities of millions of pounds a year in donations. Oxford and Cambridge vice chancellors have privately written to George Osbourne over his plan, which is attracting growing opposition from within the Conservative cabinet. Mr Cable said the proposals would have potentially serious consequences for many ‘genuine’ charities – a claim denied by the Treasury. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt is also said . to be alarmed by the proposals, which have been criticised by an . anti-poverty group founded by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan . Smith. Disgruntled: Oxford and Cambridge, pictured, vice chancellors have privately written to George Osbourne over his plan, which is attracting growing opposition from within the Conservative cabinet . Clash: Business Secretary Vince Cable has . made it clear that he is 'sympathetic' to concerns raised by . universities that funding for scholarships and research could be . affected by Mr Osborne's proposal . He said he had been contacted by leading universities concerned that they could lose vital private sector cash at a time when they are facing cuts in state funding. He said: ‘Obviously I am 100 per cent behind efforts to crack down on abusive tax avoidance – wealthy people must pay their share. But we have got to separate out that issue from genuine charitable donations. ‘Universities come within my department and they are concerned about this. For some universities this is a big deal because they get large sums in one-off payments from individual donors, which could be caught by this. ‘What is happening is that genuine charities have been caught up in something that was not intended to affect them.’ In a letter to Mr Osbourne, Andrew Hamilton, vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford, warned the tax ""risks undermining the culture"" of university philanthropy, according to The Times. A university spokesman said: ""The generosity of Oxford's donors provides huge public benefit, contributing to teaching, research and student bursaries. Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge has also written a private letter to Mr Osborne expressing his concern, the paper said. Chancellor George Osborne’s decision to cap tax relief for charitable giving has provoked a storm of protest from charities. David Bull, executive director of Unicef in the UK, warned the move would have dire consequences for the poor. He said: ‘The poorest and most vulnerable children will pay the price, and they could pay the price with their lives.’ Arts Council England warned at least £80million in regular donations to its organisations was at risk, while a new £55million ‘matched funding’ scheme with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport could also be in jeopardy. Faith-based charities also criticised the move. In an open letter, Christian Aid, the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development, Islamic Relief, Jewish Care and Muslim Aid warned the ‘misguided’ proposal would have a serious impact on their activities. Concerns: Arts Council England chair Dame Liz Forgan said donations to arts organisations were likely to suffer, while Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, is said to be worried by the proposals . They said: ‘We ask the Government urgently to reconsider this proposal so that it tackles any potential abuse, but protects the life-saving philanthropy David Cameron has rightly praised in the past.’ Mr Cable’s intervention sparked fury at the Treasury, where sources pointed out that the cap had been introduced partly to help pay for Liberal Democrat demands to raise the income tax threshold to £9,200. A source said: ‘Vince’s position seems to be a bit confused. He is setting himself against a policy that is designed to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share of tax and that helps cut tax for people on lower and middle incomes – a policy that Nick Clegg has made a big priority.’ Yesterday, as it emerged that independent schools could also be hit by the proposals, universities said Mr Cable was right to raise concerns. Dr Wendy Piatt, director-general of the Russell Group of 20 leading universities, said: ‘Our institutions are increasingly reliant on charitable giving as we strive to remain world-class. Anything that could reduce philanthropic donations would be of huge concern to us and we urge the Government to clarify the implications of this announcement.’ Treasury sources also revealed that the controversial plan might raise as little as £60million a year – of which only a fraction relates to abuse of the rules. Sources in the charitable sector suggested this would equate to losses of about £300million a year for good causes. The new proposals would cap the amount an individual can give to charity before incurring tax at £50,000 a year or a quarter of their total income, whichever is higher. Ministers claim the scheme remains ‘generous’ and will prevent abuse by individuals who give money to questionable charities, often abroad, in order to avoid tax. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said the policy had been ‘set out for extremely good reasons’. He acknowledged there had been ‘controversy’ about the proposal, but said ministers would work with charities and philanthropists ‘to ensure the removal of the tax relief does not have a significant impact on charities which depend on large donations’. On Wednesday Mr Cameron indicated that ministers were considering a partial climbdown in order to limit the damage to charities. But yesterday it remained unclear what form this would take. Former Tory leadership candidate David Davis last night said the problem could be fixed without imposing a damaging cap as most of the alleged abuse was already against the law. He said: ‘The abuse being talked about is not tax avoidance, it is concealed tax evasion. We do not need any new laws, we need better enforcement. They are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.’ Labour accused ministers of presiding over a shambles and said the Chancellor appeared to be ‘increasingly isolated’. The Treasury yesterday refused for a third day running to reveal how many tycoons it  believes are abusing the rules on charitable donations to dodge tax. A reliable source told the Mail that the heavy-handed clampdown on charitable  giving was prompted by concerns about the tax affairs of just seven wealthy individuals and their families. The Treasury took four hours to respond to the claim yesterday before indicating the true level of abuse was higher. But a spokesman refused to say how many people ministers believe are bending or breaking the rules. And he muddied the waters by saying the policy was not just about tackling abuse, but about ensuring all individuals pay a minimum level of tax. The Treasury would not comment on why it was being so secretive about the scale of a supposed loophole it has already announced it is closing. The spokesman said: ‘This is not just about a handful of people – there is a lot of it going on. But this is not just about the abuse – there is also a  broader principle of people paying a certain level of tax.’ The Treasury claims that the controversial cap on tax relief for charitable donations is essential in stamping out tax-dodging. Sources claim some wealthy individuals channel vast sums into charitable trusts  with the benefit of tax relief before moving the funds to a charity abroad and withdrawing the cash once it is away from the eyes of British authorities. Another scam involves channelling money into charitable trusts that give only a small amount to genuine charities. The rest of the cash is lent to the donor’s companies or spent on lavish parties dressed up as charitable fundraising events. Critics, including the influential Tory backbencher David Davis, point out that both scams are already illegal and could be tackled by better enforcement of the existing laws rather than a draconian cap that risks damaging genuine charities. The Treasury’s own figures suggest the amount of abuse involved is relatively small. Budget figures state that capping a series of tax reliefs will generate about £300million for the taxpayer. But the Treasury acknowledged yesterday that as little as £60million of this relates to charitable giving. But the impact on the charitable sector could be more than £300million a year. According to the Treasury the top 20 individuals affected by the changes reduced their tax bills by £145million last year by using various uncapped tax reliefs. But almost two-thirds of this related to tax relief on business losses. Only 20 per cent involved tax relief on charitable giving.","Oxbridge bosses beg Osbourne to reconsider plans .

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 16:52 EST, 26 July 2011 . A 14-year-old American citizen has been jailed for three years after telling authorities he beheaded four people whose bodies were hung from a bridge. Edgar Jimenez Lugo, known as 'El Ponchis' (The Cloaked One), was given the maximum sentence allowed for a minor in Morelos, Mexico. The U.S. teenager worked for the Beltran Leyva brothers' cartel and killed four people whose bodies were hung in Cuernavaca, authorities said. Jailed: Edgar Jimenez Lugo, of California, known as 'El Ponchis' (The Cloaked One), was given the maximum sentence allowed for a minor in Morelos, Mexico . A judge gave Lugo the maximum sentence for a minor for organised crime, homicide, kidnapping, and drug and weapons possession. He was born in San Diego, California, and was arrested in December as he tried to board a plane in Cuernavaca to Tijuana with his sisters. One of his sisters, aged 16, was also allegedly involved in the crime gang. She apparently disposed of her brother's victims by dumping the bodies on streets and freeways, officials said. Unmasked: Mexican soldiers presented Edgar 'El Ponchis' Jimenez Lugo to the media in the city of Cuernavaca, Mexico, in December 2010 . Another teen sister accompanying them is not suspected of being involved with the cartels. 'I participated in four . executions, but I did it drugged and under threat that if I didn't they . would kill me' Edgar Jimenez Lugo . A video shot by CNN in December showed the boy being interrogated by Mexican military authorities after his capture. In the video, an interrogator asks: . 'How many have you killed,' as Jimenez responds, 'four'. The soldier . then asks: 'How did you execute them?’ The . boy calmly adds: 'I slit their throats. I participated in four . executions, but I did it drugged and under threat that if I didn't they . would kill me.' Explanation: 'El Ponchis' talks to a journalist as he is presented to the media last December shortly after he was arrested . Jimenez and his siblings were living in a poor neighbourhood of Jiutepec, a working-class suburb of Cuernavaca, known as a weekend getaway for Mexico City residents. The area has an industrial area with Nissan, Unilever and other factories and has rustic single-level concrete homes and some farms. Many youths are used by drug cartels in their bloody battles against the government and each other, but the story of El Ponchis is shocking. After he was captured, he said he was kidnapped aged 11 and forced to work for the Cartel of the South Pacific, a branch of the splintered Beltran Leyva gang, and that he had participated in at least four decapitations. Mexican newspaper La Razon reported last month that El Ponchis was paid $3,000 for each murder he committed.","Edgar Jimenez Lugo gets maximum jail term for a minor .

Two huge new planets spotted by a telescopes in Chile are the oldest planets detected outside our solar system - and have been there since before the Milky Way was fully formed. Dr Johny Setiawan, whose team found the planets orbiting the star HIP 11952 said: 'If there was once intelligent civilisation there, it would have watched how the Universe started expanding after the Big Bang and how galaxies and the first stars formed.' The planets are thought to be three times as old as Earth, and were formed 12.8 billion years ago. A Jupiter-like extrasolar planet: One planet is the size of Jupiter, the other three times bigger. Both are thought to be three times as old as Earth, and were formed 12.8 billion years ago . They are just 375 light years away from our solar system. They were detected using 'radial velocity', where astronomers watch for 'wobbles' in starlight, caused by the pull of orbiting worlds. One planet is thought to be as massive as Jupiter in our solar system. The other is roughly three times the size of Jupiter. If there is life, there, it's liable to be very different from human beings. Planet formation was not thought to be possible in the early universe, when stars were 'metal poor' - lacking elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Setiawan says, 'It's iron abundance is only about one per cent that of our sun. I wonder what kind of 'blood' they have without iron element – at the time, there were almost no heavy elements available.' The new planets were detected by the European Southern Observatory at La Silla Paranal, Chile, South America . It had been thought that it was impossible for planets to form without these heavier elements. Setiawan acknowledges that the planets could have formed later in the life cycle of the star - but says this is unlikely. Usually planets form just shortly after the star formation,' he said. 'Second-generation planets might also form after a star has died, but this is still under debate.'","Two planets are 12.8 billion years old - three times older than Earth .

Teenage hackers hijacked highly sensitive telephone conversations on Scotland Yard’s anti-terrorist hotline and posted recordings on YouTube. Anarchist group TeamPoison claimed . responsibility and said it was 'easy' to bypass the . force's security - which they said was 'from the 80s'. They claim to have compromised a server from Malaysia to record conversations. The force launched an investigation today after being made aware that the phone calls may have been hacked. Scroll down for audio . Online presence: This image appears on the website of the Metropolitan Police, urging members of the public to call the confidential anti-terrorist hotline . The attack is the latest in a series of . embarrassing security breaches, and comes after 'hacktivist' group . Anonymous brought down the official Home Office website last Saturday. Scotland Yard's hotline is understood to have been hit with more than 700 calls before an American-sounding caller, using the name Trick, told them they were being 'pranked'. Detectives said 'appropriate action would be taken' after a number of recordings were posted on YouTube. In one of the clips, a man identifying himself as Trick is heard telling an officer: 'Knowledge is power... We embarrass governments and f*** the police.' The hackers overwhelmed a computer server used to host sensitive phone calls using a simple computer script to infiltrate the system. The 'Asterisk' phone server was controlled for 24 hours by the anarchist group, TeamPoison. Hacking phone networks - known as 'phreaking', a term which was in use before computer hacking even existed - allows malicious hackers to listen in or send messages to phone users on computerised exchanges. 'Phreaking' was a predecessor to today's hacking - Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was a 'phreaker' himself in the early Seventies. Nowadays, computerised phone systems mean that hackers can use computer-hacking skills to 'get inside' phone systems and eavesdrop on calls. 'Trick' is later heard laughing when a . woman comes on to the line to tell him that the phone call was being . passed on to the FBI. In another recording, officers appear to be discussing counter-terror operations while TeamPoison listens in. The group claimed to have then made . calls to MI6 - but it is understood they were in fact picked up by the . Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command. A Met Police statement said: 'We are aware of an issue whereby hoaxers have made calls to the anti-terrorist hotline and have made recordings of their conversations with anti-terrorist hotline staff. 'In addition, recordings have been made of conversations between Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) Anti-Terrorist Hotline staff. 'The MPS has launched an investigation into this matter.' Trick, reportedly a 17-year-old who launched TeamPoison in 2010, said the group bypassed outdated technology and used a server from Malaysia to record conversations. A statement from Trick read: 'The phone denial of service was done via a custom script for Asterisk which was installed on an overseas server. 'The conversation was tapped into via a private phreaking method, their phone system is old and we found a way to get in via basic but private phreaking technique.' Hacked: Scotland Yard has launched an investigation after discovering that confidential calls to its anti-terrorist hotline were recorded by hackers . In response to the Scotland Yard statement, @-TeaMp0isoN tweeted: 'OH REALLY NOW.' When asked whether he found it simple to overcome MI6 security, Trick emailed: 'Yes it was easy :)' The group has been linked to alleged hacking attempts on Facebook and a personal email account linked to a former staff member of Tony Blair's. Terror suspect: Briton Babar Ahmad has been fighting for the right to be tried in the UK, but can now be extradited to the U.S. TeamPoison said it deluged counter-terrorism officers with phone calls for 24 hours, ensuring no other calls could get through. The group claimed its attacks were prompted by a recent decision made by the European Court of Human Rights, which allowed UK-linked terror suspects Babar Ahmad and Adel Abdel to be extradited to America. By targeting the phones, the group essentially carried out the telephonic equivalent of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack - an approach often used by online hackers against Government websites. The audio recording released by TeamPoison appears to feature an MI6 officer saying, 'You are blocking these lines. People cannot get through when you’re constantly coming through here with your fun calls.' Trick told download site SoftPedia: 'Every time they picked up the phone the server would play a robot voice which said ""teampoison"".' In a recording thought to be the conversation between Trick and MI6 officers, the teenager can be heard saying, 'My name is Trick, I'm from TeamPoison - my name is Robert West', before a female officer asks, 'What's your date of birth, Robert? 'April 4, 1991,' he replies. A male voice is then heard wishing 'Robert' 'happy birthday for last week', and asking if he received any nice presents. The hacker then changes tack, saying, 'I got some terrorism for you here.' Challenged about his use of an American accent, the young man adds, 'I don't brush my teeth, I like tea, I'm from the UK.' 'What's your actual philosophy?' asks the male official. 'I'm not actually . familiar with it.' 'Our philosophy is pretty simple: it's knowledge is power,' the hacker says. 'And, uh, f**k the po-lice.' The call is terminated as the female operative states, 'Your information and everything about you is being passed to the FBI.' Another recording released by the hacktivists allegedly features MI6 staff discussing the group's attack. Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist . hotline was set up in 1991 to encourage the public to report possible . terrorist activity, and has been the subject of several costly newspaper . and radio advertising campaigns. A section of the Metropolitan Police's website dedicated to the hotline gives the following advice to users: .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 17 January 2012 . Itzcoatl Ocampo, 23, is the primary suspect in the deaths of four homeless men in Southern California. His father said his son came back a changed man after serving in Iraq . As prosecutors prepare to file murder charges against a Marine veteran in the stabbing of four homeless men, it has emerged that Itzcoati Ocampo was once a caring, charitable man until the horrors of Iraq 'killed the person he was'. The 23-year-old was arrested on Friday after being chased down by a group of bystanders following the brutal stabbing of Vietnam veteran John Berry outside an Orange County fast food restaurant - the fourth vicious stabbing in as many weeks. As Ocampo is held on psychological watch at the Orange County jail in Santa Ana, his family and friends have revealed the ex-Marine was once a caring man who helped the very people he is accused of murdering. 'I saw him so many times giving the last money he had in his pocket ... to the homeless, to the people that (are) asking for some help. ... My son's always been a role model,' his father Refugio Ocampo said in a video interview posted on Orange County Register website. His son is now accused in . the stabbing deaths of James Patrick . McGillivray, 53, who was killed in Placentia on December 20, Lloyd . Middaugh, . 42, who was found in Anaheim on December 28, Paulus Smit, 57, who was . found in Yorba Linda two days later and recently John Berry, 64, who was . stabbed to death in Anaheim on Friday. It was only when he returned from serving in Iraq - where he was assigned to meet and inspect the wounded when they were flown in from combat zones en . route to the hospital - that he starting showing a darker side, became paranoid and delusional and struggled to find his way as a civilian. Scroll down for video . Worried: Refugio Ocampo, the father of the 23-year-old son who is the prime suspect in the killings of four homeless men, is himself homeless and said the Iraq war killed the man his son used to be .

Photos of homeless men killed in Orange County are displayed during a news conference in Santa Ana today as the DA file murder charges against former Marine Itzcoati Ocampo . Ocampo's father Refugio Ocampo, 49, said his son was a changed man after his deployment to the war zone in 2008. 'They killed the person he was. And that's the only possibility I can think of that he would do something like that.' His brother Mixcoatl Ocampo, 17, told the LA Times his brother sank into a depression and often suffered from hallucinations. He said: 'He was always paranoid. He would search the closet and bathrooms of the home for . bombs. I would tell him to stop being crazy.' The teen also revealed his brother had been applying for jobs everywhere but would never get hired and soon stopped even trying. His father said things turned even worse when a close friend of his from the Marines died in Afghanistan in 2010. 'Once he received the news he was never the same. He said terrible things are going to . happen. The end of the world is coming. He started searching for hidden . things that weren't there, like guns and knives,' his father, 49, said. Normal young man: Itzcoatl Ocampo's family have released these images of the young man, showing him in happier times . The victims: From left, James McGillivray was stabbed outside a shopping centre on December 20; Lloyd Middaugh was found stabbed on a riverbed on December 28; and Paulus Cornelius Smit was found stabbed outside a library on December 30 . Locations: Police in Orange County, California said a serial killer was responsible for the first . three killings in December. They are investigating if the fourth, which happened on Friday, is connected . Cautious: Homeless people in Orange County were put on alert by police and advocates concerned that they're the target of a serial killer who has already slain three homeless men . Like the men his son is accused of preying . on, Mr Ocampo is homeless after losing his job as a warehouse manager. He ended up living . under a bridge before finding shelter in the cab of a broken-down truck . he is helping repair. Just days before he was arrested, Itzcoatl Ocampo visited his father, . warning him of the danger of being on the streets and showing him a . picture of one of the victims. 'He was very worried about me,' Mr Ocampo said. 'I told him, ""Don't worry. I'm a survivor. Nothing will happen to . me"".' Anaheim Police Chief John Welter has . said investigators are confident they have the man responsible for the . murders. They are expected to hold a press conference later today. Ocampo lived with his mother and . other relatives in the suburbs. His mother, who speaks little English, . tearfully brought her son's Marine Corps dress uniform out of a closet . and showed photos, citations and medals from his military service. The son followed a friend into the . Marine Corps right out of high school in 2006 instead of going to . college as his father had hoped. His family described a physical . condition Itzcoatl suffered in which his hands shook and he suffered . headaches. Medical treatments helped until he started drinking heavily, . they said. A neighbour who is a Vietnam veteran . he and Ocampo's father both tried to push the 23-year-old to get . treatment at a veteran's hospital, but he refused. Shrine: Several people pay their respects at a makeshift memorial site where a homeless man was killed in Anaheim, California last week . Clues: An image from surveillance video at a California strip mall shows James McGillivray before his death . All of the victims died as a result . of frenzied and brutal stabbings, with each man suffering at least 40 . lacerations to their body. Police hunted the serial killer for . weeks as he continued to prey on the destitute and needy, leaving the . entire homeless community in  state of fear. Police have yet to . establish a motive for the senseless killings. Fellow Marine Robert Hays,who met . Ocampo at basic training in San Diego in 2006, told the Los Angeles . Times he thought the 23-year-old was 'motivated and gung-ho'. But he admits he noticed a vast change in him after his deployment. He told the paper: 'He came back totally changed. It was almost like he didn't care anymore. He'd get fidgety, he'd . start shaking, spacing out. You'd see him staring off.' Jesus Balbuena, who was Ocampo's roommate at . Camp Pendleton after his return from Iraq, said he would 'wake . up screaming at the top of his lungs twice a week. He would have . flashbacks' and would often weep as he talked about his family's demise into financial hardship. When he left active duty in 2010 he . was devastated to find that his father - who studied law in Mexico - was . homeless and living under a bridge. FBI: Special agent William O'Leary announcing the arrest of Itzcoatl Ocampo. They are expected to charge him with the murders of four men today . The Veterans Administration had diagnosed him with psychological problems. Bonnie Tisdale, who acted as Ocampo's . supervisor at Camp Pendleton, told the Times he was a punctual and reliable . Marine. 'Regardless of what he's been accused of, I trust him with my . life,' the 27-year-old, of Vista, said. 'He's a veteran who did not get the . help he needed. 'It's traumatising over there and it . is difficult for Marines to come and ask for psychological help. Whether . he's proven innocent or guilty, he is our brother. We are his family.' Mr Ocampo said he has repeatedly attempted to visit his son at the Orange County jail but has been turned away. ' They won't let us see him, even though the whole world is against him.' He also said investigators . came to him on Friday night and showed him surveillance photos from a . crime scene, but he did not recognize his son as the person in the . images. 'If he did it, it wasn't right, obviously. But there's something wrong with him,' he said. A community remembers: Megan Munoz, 13, adds a message to a spontaneous memorial to John Berry, on the spot where the homeless veteran was murdered behind a Carl's Jr. restaurant in Anaheim . Staying informed: Julia Adams, right, and Megan Munoz, both 13, read an article about the killings . While Refugio Ocampo lives away from . his family, they remain close. He saw his children every day, and his . wife brings food to the parking lot where the truck is located in the . city of Fullerton. He and his two sons went to get haircuts together . just a day before the arrest, the father said. Refugio Ocampo, who said he was . educated as a lawyer in Mexico, immigrated with his wife and Itzcoatl in . 1988 and became a U.S. citizen. He described building a successful life . in which he became a warehouse manager and bought a home in Yorba . Linda. In the past few years he lost his job, ran out of savings, lost . his house and separated from his wife. Standing near the truck where he . sleeps, the father fought back tears as he described the changes he saw . in his son in the year since returning home. 'Before, he had the initiative to do things, the desire. But after the military, he didn't have any of that,' he said. That was far from the son who in high school was a polite and motivated student, he said. A school friend, Brian Doyle, . portrayed Itzcoatl Ocampo as a fun-loving teen who liked to hit on girls . when he joined the military. After he was discharged and returned home . he became isolated and trusted no one, said Doyle, 23. Doyle had difficulty describing the change he saw in his friend from high school.

The British ‘madam’ arrested on vice charges in the US was held after she approached a banker about investing in a company that would charge executives a fee to meet glamorous young women she dubbed ‘sugar babies’, it has been claimed. Anna Gristina, 44, faces charges she secreted as much as £6.4 million from a New York prostitution business in offshore bank accounts. But an aide to the Scottish-born mother of four says she was soliciting funds for a matchmaking company when detectives pounced on her. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Vincent Parco said the firm, Verified Arrangements, aimed to match ambitious young women – the ‘sugar babies’ – with ageing ‘sugar daddies’. It was based in a Manhattan flat that authorities claim was an exclusive brothel. However, Gristina’s lawyers claim she enlisted Parco, a 61-year-old former investigator for New York State medical regulators, to ensure there would be no wrongdoing in the apartment. Parco was ‘tasked’ with checking female recruits had upstanding backgrounds and male clients were not exaggerating their financial assets. ‘These ladies weren’t street hookers,’ Parco said. ‘They were single, smart girls looking for relationships with guys who shared their desire for love and money. My job was to ensure everyone was on the up and up.’ Gristina’s lead attorney, Peter Gleason, confirmed Gristina, who infamously posted online half-naked pictures of herself and her third husband, Kelvin Gorr, 38, was setting up a dating site that ‘would have rivalled Match.com’. Mother of four Anna Gristina appears in State Supreme Court on March 6 charged with promoting prostitution . The alleged Upper East Side brothel where accused Manhattan Madam Anna Gristina reportedly ran a high-class escort service . His client claimed in a statement from . the New York jail where she is in solitary confinement that, far from . earning millions, she has been struggling to pay university fees for one . of her daughters. ‘She came up with the notion of a dating agency to make a few bucks,’ Parco said. A second woman, Jaynie Baker, 30, is reportedly being sought by prosecutors on suspicion she was Gristina’s partner. Yesterday, it emerged that she is negotiating to turn herself in. She too claims she is a matchmaker, not a madam. Prosecutors claim they have videotape evidence of sexual encounters at Anna’s rented ‘love nest’ and say she was recorded boasting that she was protected by her friendship with police officers, FBI agents and politicians. A prostitute called Lizzie claims men paid from £500 to £1,300 an hour for sex and Gristina charged up to £16,000 for women who accompanied clients – who included ‘royalty’ – on short breaks. Gristina was arrested as she left the Morgan Stanley investment bank after meeting with wealth management adviser, David Walker, 47. He has since been suspended. ‘He was a Wall Street guy she went to see to raise money for the dating agency,’ said Parco. ‘There was nothing wrong with it.’ The spacious home of alleged Manhattan Madam Anna Gristina, and her husband, Kelvin Gorr, in Monroe, New York .

"By . Beth Stebner . UPDATED: . 05:07 EST, 13 March 2012 . The girlfriend of infamous mobster James ‘Whitey’ Bulger will plead guilty to helping him evade capture for 16 years, according to reports. As part of a plea deal, Catherine Greig, 60, will plead guilty to conspiracy to harbour a fugitive as well as identity theft. The families of Bulger’s alleged victims say Greig also refuses to testify against her long-time boyfriend and will not cooperate with federal prosecutors. Plea deal: Catherine Greig, longtime girlfriend of mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger (right) will plead guilty to helping him remain on the lam for 16 years . Normal life: Greig, seen in this undated photo provided by the FBI, was a dental hygienist before she succumbed to a life on the run . Boston-based U.S. attorney Carmen Oritz warned victim’s families that because she has no prior convictions, Greig could be behind bars for as few as 32 months, the Boston Herald reported. Both crimes carry a maximum prison sentence of five years each. Prosecutors said last fall they were considering filing additional charges against her. She has a pre-trial hearing scheduled for Wednesday, and her trial is scheduled for May 7. Bulger’s trial is scheduled for November 5. Greig, a former dental hygienist, and Bulger were on the run for 16 years, often hiding in plain sight by assuming false identities. They were captured in California on June 22 of last year, living modest middle-class lives in a $3,000 per month Santa Monica apartment complex. In the big house: Greig could serve as little as 32 months because she has no prior convictions, a prosecutor said . Life of crime: Map showing how many murders Bulger is accused of committing and their location in the Boston area . Bulger, now 82 and said to be suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, has pleaded not guilty in connection with 19 killings. He headed Boston's infamous Winter Hill Gang and was an FBI informant against the rival New England Mafia and was on the FBI's most-wanted list for over a decade. Often, he was second only to Osama bin Laden, and had a $1million bounty on his head. His's former FBI handler, John Connolly Jr., was convicted of racketeering for warning Bulger that he was about to be indicted just before Bulger fled Boston in late 1994. After he was arrested, agents found . $822,198 in cash in his apartment, much of it in packages containing . $100 bills that were hidden inside a wall, prosecutors said, money which . is now frozen. In their memo, prosecutors say that during his 16 years on the run, Bulger 'financed a relatively comfortable lifestyle' for himself and Greig.

Former home secretary Alan Johnson had 'no appetite' for inspectors to review Scotland Yard's original police phone-hacking investigation . A Labour minister blocked an independent inquiry into Scotland Yard’s phone hacking investigation in 2009, the Leveson Inquiry heard yesterday. Sir Denis O’Connor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, said he wanted to examine the case because it raised ‘substantial public confidence issues’. But he told the inquiry that his proposed review ‘never really got off the ground’ because the then Home Secretary Alan Johnson had ‘no appetite’ for it. The original Met phone hacking investigation, launched in December 2005, resulted in the News of the World’s royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire being jailed for intercepting voicemail messages. But no action was taken against any other reporters and the inquiry failed to identify hundreds of victims. Sir Denis said he had a discussion about the report with a Home Office civil servant on the day it appeared in print. He told the inquiry: 'I said, looking at this, that I thought the revelations merited some form of independent review. 'I thought that the allegations that . were there, if true in any degree, would raise substantial public . confidence issues, and I would not be surprised if the HMIC were asked . to assist in some way to facilitate such an approach... 'I think there was a second - again in the margins of other business - conversation with another, more senior official. Deaf ears: Sir Denis O'Connor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, said he advised Home Office officials there should be an independent review after the Guardian story . 'But my understanding was that, as . with a number of other options, discussions ensued with ministers and . the home secretary at the time, and there was no appetite for the HMIC . being involved. 'So it never really got off the ground, sadly.' Lord Justice Leveson today indicated he will not simply accept proposals by the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) for reforming the system of newspaper regulation without subjecting them to 'forensic scrutiny'. PCC chairman Lord Hunt of Wirral said last week that the watchdog would close this year to create a new 'press regulator with teeth'. Lord Justice Leveson said today: 'From the outset of this inquiry, I have said to editors that the problems of press regulation are theirs and that they should seek to find a solution. 'I have equally emphasised that the solution not only has to work for them but it must also work for me, by which I have explained I mean the public at large. In January, Lord Hunt proposed that the body which replaces the PCC should have separate divisions for dealing with complaints and enforcing standards - and perhaps a third arm with powers to mediate in disputes with newspapers and award compensation. Publishers would have to sign up to the new regulator on a five-year rolling contract, he suggested. Lord Leveson added: 'I repeat that Lord Hunt and the industry must continue to work on what they see as the best way forward - not, I hope, simply viewing the task as one of trying to persuade me to adopt what for them is a ""least worst"" option - but they must expect that the ultimate suggestion will be subjected to forensic analysis.' Sir Denis was speaking after Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, the Yard's most senior female officer, told the inquiry that there was no 'culture' of leaks from the police to the media. She said some officers had been prepared to take money from the press but that it had been carried out by isolated individuals. 'I genuinely believe that the police service that I'm in is less corrupt than it has ever been,' she said. She also defended her predecessor, John Yates, for ruling out reopening the phone-hacking investigation in 2009, prompting Lord Leveson to brand the decision as 'disastrous'. ACC Yates was asked by the commissioner to reconsider the original investigation following the revelations printed in the Guardian. After reviewing the case for eight hours, ACC Yates concluded that ‘no further investigation is required’. Ms . Dick said though the decision was ‘poor’ it was ‘impossible to . countenance’ what Mr Yates did was not what ‘he saw as his best and the . right thing’. ‘The outcome of the decision was not only poor, it was disastrous,’ Lord Leveson responded. Mr Yates later resigned over his . handling of the scandal and his alleged links to Neil Wallis, the former . News of the World executive. Lord Leveson added: ‘It has been . suggested Mr Yates was very keen to dismiss [the revelations], and that . might been because of his friendship with Mr Wallis. ‘It might also be possible he adopted . a rather too dismissive a line for reasons which do not bear on his . integrity but demonstrate a lack of judgement.’ Asked what she would have done in the . same situation, she said: ‘If I had been asked to do this piece of work . and I knew somebody as well as it now appears he knew, [I would ask]… . do I have any conflict? ‘And if you do think you have any . conflict you have to discuss that with the boss, and that's what I would . have done - at a minimum a conflict like that should be discussed.’ Top cops: Assistant Commissioner Cressida . Dick defended her predecessor, John Yates (right) for ruling out . reopening the phone-hacking investigation in 2009 . She . earlier told the inquiry how she had to bat down Boris Johnson's deputy . when he kept questioning the resources devoted to the force's new . phone-hacking investigation. She . said she reminded Kit Malthouse that it was for her to make the . decision, not him, because British police are operationally independent. My business: Miss Dick said she reminded Dept London Mayor Kit Malthouse (pictured) that it was for her to make the decision, not him, because British police are operationally independent . Former Metropolitan Police . commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson told the inquiry last week that the . deputy London Mayor complained about the level of resources allocated to . the investigation because of a political and media-driven 'level of . hysteria'. Ms Dick said Mr . Malthouse, then-chairman of Scotland Yard's former governing body the . Metropolitan Police Authority, voiced his concerns to her after Scotland . Yard launched a new phone-hacking probe in January 2011. She . told the inquiry: ‘On a couple of occasions Mr Malthouse, I thought . jokingly, said to me, “I hope you're not putting too much resources into . this, Cressida”. ‘On the third occasion when he said . it again, I said, ""well, that's my decision and not yours, and that's . why I'm operationally independent"". ‘We then went on to have a perfectly reasonable sort of conversation about where the public interest lay.’ Ms Dick said she wanted to ‘put down a . marker’ for Mr Malthouse so that he and the police investigation were . not compromised if it was ever suggested that officers had bowed to . political pressure. The Inquiry also heard that Ms Dick . did not discuss the progress of her investigation into the racist murder . of teenager Stephen Lawrence at meetings of the Met's top officers . because of fears about leaks. She . said she restricted briefings to 'people who really needed to know' and . did not discuss the case at Scotland Yard's management board to . minimise the risk of unauthorised information being reported in the . media. Ms Dick said: 'This was an investigation which over the years had been obviously very important to the public and to the Met. Innocent: ACC Dick led the bungled operation that led to the killing of Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005 . 'But in the 1990s one of the things that had been difficult about it as an investigation had been unauthorised disclosure of information... 'I took the decision when I took this on that as soon as we started our forensic review in 2005-06, I would personally only brief the commissioner, and only intermittently, on the progress of that review. 'Because I was absolutely determined, if I could possibly ensure it, that only those people who really needed to know did know in case there was any unhelpful media coverage which might undermine the investigation or any future trial in terms of people's right to a fair trial.' Ms Dick also described how journalists had waited outside her house . after Brazilian de Menezes was shot dead by police after he . was mistaken for a suicide bomber the day after failed attacks on . London in July 2005. It was his killing that brought Ms Dick into the public eye. Officers under her 'tactical delivery' command mistakenly identified him as one of five wouldbe suicide bombers wanted for an attack on the London transport network in July 2005. Mr de Menezes was tailed to Stockwell tube station in South London, followed on to a tube train  -  and shot seven times in the head in front of horrified passengers. It later emerged that Ms Dick, 49, oversaw a 'noisy and quite chaotic' control room. While the inquest jury said she should be absolved of any personal culpability, the Independent Police Complaints Commission criticised her for not making it explicitly clear to her officers that when she ordered Mr de Menezes to be 'stopped' she did not intend for him to be shot. 'I have no complaint about scrutiny received, I expected it . and was not surprised by any of it. Senior public officials have to . expect a great deal of attention,' she said.","Chief Inspector of Constabulary tells Leveson Inquiry that independent inquiry 'never got off ground'

A home-made drone capable of launching airborne cyber attacks and hijacking mobile phone calls has been developed by two computer security experts. The Wireless Aerial Surveillance Platform - or Wasp - was constructed from a former U.S. Army target drone. Richard Perkins and Mike Tassey customised the aircraft so it can find and track internet hotspots and mobile phones. Scroll down for video . Airborne cyber master: The Wireless Aerial Surveillance Platform - or Wasp - was constructed from a former U.S. Army target drone. Inventor Richard Perkins introduces the craft at the DefCon hacking conference in Las Vegas at the weekend . Mr Perkins and co-designer Mike Tassey customised the aircraft so it can find and track internet hotspots and mobile phones . It can identify unsecured online gateways and then exploit these to launch cyber attacks on computer systems. The . craft can also capture GMS mobile PIN numbers that can then be used to . pay for outgoing calls, allow hackers to eavesdrop on conversations and . even impersonate mobile phone towers. Mr . Perkins said: 'It will fly a plotted course and return to base. We . loaded it up with the ability to attack wi-fi, Bluetooth, and GSM . cellular networks.' The two men exhibited the bright yellow Wasp, which weighs just 14lbs, at the DefCon hacking conference in Las Vegas at the weekend.

The implications and potential uses for Wasp are quite extraordinary. It could find mobile phones in disaster areas and lead rescuers to survivors, or it could fly over a disaster zone to act as a mobile phone tower enabling calls. However, if it were to fall into the wrong hands, Wasp could quite easily infiltrate a company's computer networks via unsecured wi-fi networks. And that's just for starters. Mr Perkins said: 'I can take the various pieces of your digital life - Bluetooth headset, mobile phone, wi-fi - and find the least secure place you exist and attack you there.' Even more worryingly, Wasp could carry a small payload, opening up the potential for smugglers to use it or to serve as a targeted biological or nuclear weapon in a terror attack. Unsurprisingly, authorities in the U.S. will not allow the drone to fly over populated areas.","The Wireless Aerial Surveillance Platform can also hijack mobile phone calls .

A woman stabbed her brother to death with a carving knife at his housewarming party in a row over a cigarette, a court heard today. Claire Gray, 22, had written on Facebook just hours before murdering Ashley, 24, that 'someone is going to get a knife in the neck like'. Fed-up of her constant threats, the young woman's brother handed her a foot-long knife and challenged her to attack him at his party in Ferryhill, County Durham. Murdered: Ashley Gray, 24, was stabbed to death by his sister Claire Gray, 22, after handing her a foot-long knife and challenging her to do it . But she followed through with her threat and knifed him once in the chest, Teesside Crown Court was told. Today Claire Gray was jailed for life with a minimum term of just 12 years after admitting murder. Mark Giuliani, prosecuting, said that Mr Gray 'went into the kitchen and returned with a knife and gave it to her,' then said words to the effect of 'go on then'. Mr Giuliani said: 'She took the knife and stabbed him once to the chest.' The weapon severed Mr Gray's aorta and he fell to the floor and he bledito death 'within minutes' on October 14 last year. The court was told Claire Gray had served three years in a young offenders' institution for another knife attack and had only recently been released. Mr Giuliani said that in 2009 Claire Gray stabbed Matthew Hodges 'numerous times to the head, neck and back'. The court was told that Claire was aggressive when she arrived at the house party - hours after writing on Facebook 'nobody's stopping Claire bear'. Mr Giuliani said: 'The mood of the party was a good one. The music was playing in the background, people talked, enjoying a drink. Stabbing: The scene where Claire Gray knifed her brother to death at a house party in October. Today she was jailed for life at Teeside Crown Court . 'The front door had been left open and guests were coming and going throughout the evening.' But when she arrived at the party, Claire began threatening guests, insisting: 'I'm going to stab someone tonight.' When Claire and her brother began arguing over a cigarette, Claire threatened to stab him and said: 'Get a knife, get a knife.' Mr Gray went into the kitchen and returned with a foot-long carving knife which had an eight-inch blade and dropped it into Claire's lap as she sat. Mr Gray told her: 'Go on then, do it,' She then stabbed him in the chest in 'a complete rage,' the court heard. As guests tried to restrain her, Claire again lifted the knife to stab her brother. She was heard to say: 'I hope he dies' before leaving the house and walking to her grandmother's house. Paramedics rushed to the scene as guests tried to stem the blood flow. But he showed no sign of life and he was later pronounced dead. Police arrested Claire shortly after the attack and she shouted at officers: 'He f***ing deserved it'. Claire initially denied stabbing her brother and insisted she had simply pushed him away as he tried to attack her. However, today she admitted murder. Brian Russell, defending, said it was a 'bizarre set of circumstances' that led to Claire being given a murder weapon to use by her victim. He said Mr Gray was 'an author of his own demise' and that Claire would not have stabbed him had he not given her the weapon. Mr Russell said Claire's earlier threats were just 'bluster' and she did not really intend to stab anyone that night until she was handed the knife. He told the court Claire was 'devastated' over her brother's death and that she had held him in high regard. Mr Russell said Claire's family 'very much want her back in their life as soon as possible.' He said they consider Mr Gray's death a 'tragedy' and want Claire's sentence to be as short as possible. As he jailed her, Judge Peter Fox said he accepted the attack was not pre-meditated. He said: 'You are only 22 years of age. You have your life ahead of you.' She changed her surname to Lock in February, but was referred to as Gray during the court proceedings today.","Claire Gray's brother Ashley, 24, handed her a foot-long knife and challenged her to stab him - so she did .

Nicolas Sarkozy lashed out at a journalist on live television after she raised allegations about him receiving £42million from Colonel Gaddafi. The French President accused Laurent Ferrari of acting like a 'spokeswoman for Gaddafi's son' after she raised the matter at the beginning of a question-and-answer programme. Mr Sarkozy added: 'It's grotesque and I am sorry that I am being interrogated about declarations of Gaddafi or his son on an important channel like TF1.' Clash: Nicolas Sarkozy (left) accused Laurent Ferrari (right) of acting like a 'spokeswoman for Gaddafi's son' after she raised allegations about him receiving £42million from the former Libyan dictator . Anger: Nicolas Sarkozy (left) lashed out at a journalist on live television after she raised allegations about him receiving £42million from Colonel Gaddafi (right) But Mr Sarkozy, who is standing for re-election in two months' time, failed to address the contents of a leaked governmental note which suggests his 2007 campaign was funded by the Libyan dictator. 'If he had financed it, then I haven't been very grateful,' said Mr Sarkozy, who was once a close ally of Gaddafi until launching French jets and missiles to support the revolt which led to his murder last year. A year ago, Gaddafi's son, Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi, called Mr Sarkozy a 'clown' and said he should 'pay back' the money he taken from the Libyan people'. Attacking Ms Ferrari last night, Mr Sarkozy said: 'I am sorry for you that you are the spokeswoman for Gaddafi's son. Bitter: Nicolas Sarkozy said the questioning was 'grotesque' was 'sorry' he was being interrogated about declarations of Gaddafi or his son on an important channel like TF1 . Close: Extraordinary evidence made public in Paris is said to prove that the two former close allies had an illegal financial arrangement which propelled Mr Sarkozy to power in 2007 . 'Gaddafi, who is known for talking nonsense, even said that there were cheques. Well then the son should just go ahead and produce them then.' French President Nicolas Sarkozy overtook Socialist challenger Francois Hollande for the first time today in an opinion poll on the first round of France's April/May election. It came due to him attacking the European Union's trade and immigration policies. But the conservative incumbent was still shown losing to Hollande in a second-round runoff, but by a narrower margin. Sarkozy's poll boost came as far-right leader Marine Le Pen, ranked third in polls, said she had secured the 500 official sponsors needed to enter the presidential contest. Candidates have until Friday to obtain the requisite backing of 500 elected officials to compete in the April 22 first round, after which the two frontrunners face off in a May 6 runoff. In fact the briefing note, leaked by investigative news site Mediapart, makes no mention of cheques - instead suggesting that hard cash was paid to the Sarkozy camp through secret bank accounts in Panama and Switzerland. A meeting between Mr Sarkozy and his aides, which is referred to in the note as having taken place on October 6th 2005, led to 'campaign finance to NS (Nicolas Sarkozy)' being 'totally solved'. At the time Mr Sarkozy was an ambitious Interior Minister who was raising money for his presidential election campaign, even though taking cash from a notorious tyrant would have broken political financing laws. Mediapart claims that €50million referred to in the note was laundered through accounts including a Swiss one opened in the name of the sister of Jean-Francois Cope, the leader of Mr Sarkozy's ruling UMP party. The money was then distributed through an arms dealer called Ziad Takieddine, who was used to acting as a middle man between Arab despots and French politicians. Eyebrows were raised when Colonel Gaddafi was honoured with a state visit to Paris in late 2007, just after Mr Sarkozy became president. He was referred to as the 'Brother Leader' by the French, and allowed to pitch his trademark tent next to the Elysee Palace. Bernard Cazeneuve, spokesman for Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande, said: 'Anyone could have been legitimately surprised by how Gaddafi was received by the current government until not that long ago.'

Israeli airstrikes killed two militants and a schoolboy in the Gaza Strip today as Palestinian rocket squads continued to bombard Israel. The cross-border violence, started by Israel's killing of a top militant leader on Friday, has been the worst exchange of fire between Israel and the Hamas-ruled territory in months. The fighting so far has killed 21 Gazans, including 18 militants, seriously wounded two Israelis, and disrupted the lives of a million Israelis living within the range of Gaza rockets. Protection: Israel launches a missile from its Iron Dome system in response to a rocket strike from the nearby Palestinian Gaza Strip . Rubble: These homes in the Gaza strip are shadows of their former selves after the Israeli airstrikes . Destroyed: Palestinians inspect the rubble of a building following an Israeli air strike in Jabaliya today . And Israel claimed the damage could have been even worse were it not for its newly introduced Iron Dome missile defence system. It claimed the technology had intercepted dozens of rockets since the clashes erupted. The Israeli military said it carried out nine air attacks against rocket-launching sites and a weapons storage facility today. Islamic Jihad said two of its militants were killed in two separate raids, one while he was riding a motorcycle. Injured: Palestinian medics wheel a wounded man to the treatment room of Shifa hospital following an Israeli air strike in Gaza City today . Talks: Islamic Jihad militants during a press conference in Gaza City today following the strikes . Blood on his hands: A wounded Palestinian at a hospital in Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip today . A 16-year-old boy wearing a school uniform was killed when a group of five civilians was struck in another attack, Gaza health official Adham Abu Salmia said. More than 20 Palestinians, including several children, were wounded in a separate pre-dawn strike in Gaza City, he added. Chief Israeli military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai said the raid had targeted munitions that were stored in a residential building. The military said the air attacks came in response to continued rocket fire. Chaos: Palestinian medical workers wheel a wounded man for treatment following an Israeli airstrike this morning . Wounded: These Palestinian children were injured in the airstrikes today . Gruesome: Rockets have been fired by both sides over the last four days . Schools in the area were closed for a second day to avoid casualties; a day earlier, a rocket struck the courtyard of one of the empty schools. Militants also fired three mortar shells into Kerem Shalom, the sole cargo crossing between Israel and Gaza and the conduit for 70 per cent of all goods that enter the Palestinian territory. Two vehicles were hit on the Palestinian side of the crossing, but there were no injuries. Operations were halted for about half an hour before resuming. But although the violence shows no immediate signs of subsiding, both Hamas and Israel seem eager to avoid the kind of all-out war that erupted three years ago. In keeping with its practice since that conflict, Hamas has stayed out of the current clashes, for fear of provoking a harsh Israeli retaliation. But it has not stopped other, smaller Gaza factions from attacking Israel, and Israel continues to hold it ultimately responsible for any violence emanating from Gaza.","Cross-border violence began Friday when Israel killed top militant leader .

'We believe that there are a few areas that will benefit from additional work and will optimize the safety and success of this mission.' No new launch date has been announced. The SpaceX launch is unique because the rockets are reusable - and will return to Earth once the Dragon capsule has been released into orbit. The ISS astronauts will grab it with a robotic arm . SpaceX will work with Nasa to set a new date for Dragon's rendezvous with the space station. 'We are now working with NASA to establish a new target launch date, but note that we will continue to test and review data. We will launch when the vehicle is ready,' said Grantham. Ready for take-off: Alanna Krolikowski peers inside the SpaceX Dragon space capsule, on display for the 27th National Space Symposium in Colorado Springs . NASA . has turned to industry to help stock the space station now that the . space shuttles are retired, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in . this start-up effort. The station currently is supplied by Russian, . European and Japanese vessels. SpaceX's . Dragon capsule will fly within two miles of the space station, for a . checkout of all its systems. Then it will close in, with station . astronauts grabbing the capsule with a robotic arm. The Dragon . ultimately will be released for a splashdown in the Pacific. Innovation: The SpaceX Dragon spacecraft pictured during the launch of the new Tesla showroom in Washington, DC on February 10 . Hard at work: The SpaceX Dragon completed a significant milestone on November 16 when the capsule was mated with the trunk inside the company's launch processing hangar in Cape Canaveral, Florida . None of the other cargo carriers come back intact; they burn up on re-entry. If . the rendezvous and docking fail, SpaceX will try again. That was the . original plan: to wait until the third mission to actually hook up with . the station and delivery supplies. SpaceX wanted to hurry it up. None of the supplies on board the Dragon will be one-of-a-kind or crucial, in case of failure. SpaceX . – run by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk – is one of several companies . vying for space station visiting privileges. It hopes to step up to . astronaut ferry trips in perhaps three more years. In the meantime, . Americans will be forced to continue buying seats on Russian Soyuz . spacecraft. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said on Friday at a forum in Seattle about NASA's future: 'Every decision that we make at SpaceX is focused on... taking crew to space.' Success: On February 7, 2012, SpaceX will attempt another orbital flight from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

An abusive husband has been jailed for plotting with an undercover policeman to have his mother-in-law killed. Bhupinder Dhesi, from Gravesend, Kent, had earlier suggested he would like 'an accident' to happen to his estranged wife, Maidstone Crown Court heard. But a week later he decided her mother should die instead, and then arranged to give an officer £12,000 if he murdered Parminder Kaur Sandhu. Dhesi, 36, originally made his sinister suggestion to a private investigator - who he had hired to help him find his wife Sanjeet and their two children. His requests soon turned strange, however, as the 'cold and calculating' man asked investigator Tony Gaskin to find him two witnesses to give false evidence in his mortgage fraud court case. The investigator, who was uneasy with the request, asked Dhesi to email him his requirements, and went on to contact the police. Dhesi then said in a recorded conversation played in court that he wanted his mother-in-law killed, because she was standing in the way of him getting his wife and children back. Detectives arrested him . at his home on October 13 last year - days before he was due to stand . trial at Maidstone Crown Court on two fraud charges. Sentencing Dhesi to 11 years in jail yesterday, Judge Jeremy Carey said: 'The facts reveal a very grave state of affairs. 'To say this was an extreme response is a substantial understatement.' Dhesi, who has a history of domestic violence, contacted Mr Gaskin in September last year and asked to help him get in touch with his wife, as he was banned from contacting her under a non-molestation order. Murder plot: Dhesi, 36, was sentenced to 11 years in jail at Maidstone Crown Court . She had moved back in with her parents and he blamed his mother-in-law for keeping her away from him. He then said he wanted Mrs Sandhu 'hurt'. When asked how badly, he replied: 'Very, very, very.' Asked if they were talking dead or alive, he responded: 'The first one you said.' He later showed the officer a picture of Mrs Sandhu on his mobile phone and said he wanted her 'put away.' The officer asked: 'Are we talking dead?' and Dhesi replied: 'Yeah.' A fee of £10-12,000 was agreed, with a . £1,000 deposit. But Dhesi cancelled the next meeting, saying he had not . raised the £1,000. Deepak Kapur, prosecuting, told the court: 'He referred to the fact that Parminder Sandhu had a hold on the family.' Dhesi admitted soliciting to murder, perverting the course of justice and three mortgage fraud offences involving £650,000. Following the case, Detective Chief . Inspector Andrea Bishop, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime . Directorate, said: 'Dhesi was cold and calculating and prepared to go to . any length to get his wife and children back. 'It didn't matter to . him if that cost money or meant getting people to lie on his behalf.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 18:34 EST, 4 January 2012 . A former college student who became depressed and erratic after becoming a mother is charged with lying about where her missing 18-month-old son has been for more than a month. Authorities said they were desperately searching for Amir Jennings after his 22-year-old mother, Zinah Jennings, told them several inconsistent stories about the boy being with relatives and friends across the south. The mother and son were reported missing in early December, but the mother turned up after she was involved in a car accident on Christmas Eve. Where's Amir? The toddler's mother Zinah Jennigs (pictured) has lied about her son's whereabouts for over a month . Investigators said they hoped Amir Jennings was alive but they weren't getting much help from his mother. 'I'm trying to stay optimistic about this,' Columbia Police Chief Randy Scott told The Associated Press Wednesday. 'But short of being optimistic, this case bothers me.' Mr Scott said officers hope a tip line and media exposure will lead to more information. 'I want someone to call us and say, 'We just saw this on the news, we have Amir, we're sorry, we didn't realize this was going on,'' he said. 'Her stories are so across the board that our search right now is from Charlotte to Atlanta.' In early December, grandmother Jocelyn Jennings Nelson reported her own daughter missing, saying that she hadn't seen her in several days and hadn't seen her grandson since the Thanksgiving holiday. Caught in a lie: Amir's mother has been arrested and charged with unlawful conduct towards a child after police say she gave false and inconsistent information on the child's whereabouts . According to an incident report, Jennings had had a car wreck several days before and had been making 'cryptic phone calls to other family members indicating her on-going fight with depression is continuing.' 'Until we have something more on Amir, I do not rule out foul play. And in my mind, there's already an air of foul play, because no one will tell us where Amir is at. Foul play doesn't have to mean that someone is deceased. Foul play is lying to police.' -Columbia Police Chief Randy Scott . That sort of behaviour wasn't unusual for the young mother, according to relatives, who told investigators the one-time college student had begun disappearing for days on end, with her son, since his birth. 'The grandmother told me specifically that, when she was in school, she was a very good person, a very good student,' said Mr Scott, adding that relatives had previously filed several missing persons reports on Jennings. 'But once the baby was born, the conduct kind of changed.' Jennings attended Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina, for one academic year, from fall 2007 until spring 2008, a school spokeswoman said. Early on the morning of Christmas Eve, Jennings wrecked her Dodge Neon in a one-car accident near her house in Columbia. Last seen: The mother and son were last seen at their relative's house in Atlanta . Authorities learned that Jennings was reported missing and they say Jennings began giving shaky stories about her son's whereabouts. 'First it's, 'He's with my sister in Atlanta. Oh no, I'm sorry, he's with my friend in Charlotte,'' Mr Scott said. 'It's all over the place. ... Everything she's telling us is just lies.' Several days later, police again spoke with Jennings, who said her son was with a friend in Columbia, but that story was also a dead end. After days of giving police bad information, the mother was charged December 29 with unlawful conduct toward a child and is being held on $150,000 bond. Police have not released the name of Amir's father. At this point, Mr Scott said investigators have two theories. 'It's either A: Zinah has given Amir to someone. Or Zinah has, in some way, shape or form, harmed Amir,' Scott said. 'Until we have something more on Amir, I do not rule out foul play. Wrecked: Jennings showed up in late December after she wrecked her Dodge Neon . 'And in my mind, there's already an air of foul play, because no one will tell us where Amir is at. Foul play doesn't have to mean that someone is deceased. Foul play is lying to police.' Mr Scott said he's struggling to remain optimistic that Amir will be found unharmed. He would not discuss any evidence police have collected from the mother's home or car. 'It's the way this whole case is playing out,' Mr Scott said. 'It's more than just that the child is missing. The mother is lying about the whereabouts of the child.'","18-month-old Amir Jennings was reported missing in early December .

"By . Emma Reynolds . UPDATED: . 19:55 EST, 17 February 2012 . A student who hacked Facebook from his bedroom in York, and could have brought down the entire £31billion empire, was jailed for eight months yesterday. Glenn Mangham, 26, impersonated an employee of the social networking site while on holiday and hacked into three of its servers. Using the code name ‘Gamma Ray’ he stole the secret code ‘that gives Facebook its value’ and downloaded it to his hard drive on his home computer. Glenn Mangham (left), 26, who hacked Facebook from his bedroom in York, was jailed for eight months today. Pictured last year with his father, also called Glenn . His theft of valuable computer code from the company, caused panic among authorities including the FBI, who feared it was a case of industrial espionage. Judge Alistair McCreath at Southwark Crown Court asked: 'He could have brought down the whole empire presumably?' Prosecutor Sandip Patel replied: 'Potentially, yes.' The . software development student from York downloaded 'highly sensitive . intellectual property' including valuable computer 'code' when he hacked the world’s largest social network between April and May last year. Mangham - who it is believed has Asperger's . and was said to have 'no social life' - claims that his work was 'ethical hacking' and he breached the security . so that he could find vulnerabilities within the site, which the . developers could then strengthen. Security breach: Glenn Mangham infiltrated the website in 'the gravest' example of social media hacking to come before the British courts . However, Judge McCreath told him: 'This was not just a bit of . harmless experimentation - you accessed the very heart of the system of an . international business of massive size. 'This was not just fiddling about in . the business records of some tiny business of no great importance and you . acquired a great deal of sensitive and confidential information to which you . were simply not entitled.' He added: 'Potentially what you did . could have been utterly disastrous to Facebook. IT skills: Billionaire Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, 27, is just a year older than the student whose bedroom hacking threatened his site . 'You and others who attempt to hack . really must understand how serious this is, the creation of that risk the . extent of that risk and the cost of putting things right.' Mr Patel said: 'He hacked into the . social media website Facebook, he did so from his bedroom in York, and . he ultimately stole invaluable and highly sensitive intellectual . property which he downloaded on to an external hard drive. 'It represents the most extensive and grave incident of social media hacking to be brought before the British courts. 'He acted with determination, undoubted ingenuity and it was sophisticated, it was calculating, and he secured what the Crown say was his ultimate goal. 'It triggered a concerted and time-consuming investigation involving the authorities in America including the FBI who worked with the Met police in the UK.' In the tax year ending 2011, Facebook was valued at $50billion and generated $4billion in profits based on its intellectual property. Mangham is only a year younger than the website's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg - one of the world's youngest billionaires. Mr Patel said: 'It was internal communications amongst Facebook employees and the intellectual property he was accessing and stealing was to do with the way Facebook itself is run internally. 'It was some of the code of Facebook, it is the very value which is ascribed to Facebook because it is the intellectual property by which it is measured.' The gifted student, who told police he was looking for a 'mini project' when he targeted the site, first hacked into the puzzle server, which sets tests for potential employees. He also uploaded his own programs on to the server. Bypassing security and accessing the protected internal systems he 'hacked and hijacked' the account of employee Stefan Parker and managed to reset his password. Using the employee's details he then accessed the ‘mailman server’ and the ‘phabricator server’ which contains the sites most sensitive intellectual property. Mangham said that although he knew he . was breaking the law he thought the company would be 'grateful' for . his information based on his previous experience. He told the court: 'It was . to identify vulnerabilities in the system so I could compile a report for lack . of a better word that I could then bundle off to Facebook and show them what . was wrong with their systems.' Mangham has his own business set up, and is tax . registered as a 'security consultant'. Mr Patel alleged that he was not simply trying to exploit vulnerabilities, adding: 'This was clearly not his sole purpose, his actions were ultimately disruptive and intentionally malicious.' Facebook discovered the security breach during a system check and, despite his efforts to delete his digital footprint, Mangham was arrested by the Met’s e-Crime unit last June. He pleaded guilty to three counts of securing unauthorised access to computer material with intent and one of unauthorised access to computer material. He denied a further charge of making, supplying or obtaining articles for use in computer offences and this was left to lie on the file. His internet use was restricted for five . years in a similar way as child porn offenders where officials can check on his . usage and he cannot delete his history. Facebook has paid out $200,000 in investigating the breach. Web rival Yahoo! has previously paid him more than £7,000 for discovering vulnerabilities in its systems. Mr Patel added: 'The prosecution do not accept his actions were anything but malicious.' Tony Ventham, in mitigation, said: 'He did panic when he was caught. 'By that time he hadn't had the . opportunity to say ""Look I have found this vulnerability in your . system."" When asked why he didn't tell the company . about the breach earlier, he said: 'I thought ""this will have a nice . dramatic effect when I tell them"".' The student, a Arthur Conan Doyle fan, . went by the online name 'Gamma Ray' and saw the Facebook hack as 'challenge', it was claimed. 'This is someone who in previous . times would have thrown everything aside to seek the source of the Nile and he . would have continued until he did,' Mr Ventham added.","Glenn Mangham was jailed for eight months .

At one point they were so close they slept side by side, but Mokwena the black rhino has gone walkabout and his human pal is desperate to track down his two-tonne chum. Lyndsay Hunt has put out an appeal for the missing rhinoceros who has known for more than a decade. The South African says he developed a bond with the animal when he first stomped into his life at the age of two after being mauled by a rival rhino in Solole Game Reserve on South Africa’s western cape. Just the two of us: Lyndsay Hunt aboard black rhino Mokwena who he developed a bond with after he helped to nurse him back to health . The buffalo breeder then developed a bond with the leathery-skinned mammal during the years he spent nursing it back to health. The animal grew to trust Mr Hunt so much that he let him feed, ride and play with him. According to the rhino adopter Mokwena became so tame he would come like a puppy-dog when he was called by name and nuzzle him at the farm where he recovered. Mr Hunt said: ‘When I went to visit him he immediately accepted me and I fell asleep outside his holding pen and woke up with him licking my hand. ‘He would come up and lie down next to me he knew me and was very affectionate.’ On the run: According to Mr Hunt Mokwena became so tame he would come like a puppy-dog when he was called by name and nuzzle into him . Eventually returning to health, Mokwena was released into the wilds of the Solole Game Reserve in 2006. Each year Mr Hunt would return to the reserve to track down and play with his friend as these images show. But it has now been nearly a year since he has been able to track Mokwena. Mr Hunt added: ‘He's a wild rhino running around 4,000 hectares of bush.’ ‘He was very curious last time I saw him - he recognised me and reacted to my presence . ‘I came up to him and scratched him and he scratched me back . ‘I saw his tracks a week ago but I didn't see him and he is hard to find now.’ Hide and seek: Mr Hunt plays with Mokwena the two-tonne black rhino. Mr Hunt has put out an appeal to try and find his best pal . Bath time: Rhinoceroses are intelligent animals in their own right and Mr Hunt said Mokwena interacted with him on his own level . Rhinoceroses are intelligent animals in their own right and Mr Hunt said Mokwena interacted with him on his own level by bumping against him so he could climb on the rhino’s back. He added: ‘He would sometimes get excited and run towards me at full gallop in open savannah with something for me to climb up to get safely out the way. ‘So instead of worrying about dodging out the way I would swing onto his back. ‘He was only being playful and there was no aggression.’ Mr Hunt is eager to find his friend, who is now 12, so he can finally mate. He believes the animal is timid around females after the traumatic injury he received from another bull when he was very young. But Mr Hunt said he is still determined to find a suitable mate for Mokwena before he is too old. ‘Rhinos are very intolerant of one another and will fight and even kill their own young. There are a lot of aggression issues but you need to find the right temperament,’ he added. However the mission to mate Mokwena is a difficult one - the few black rhinos there are for sale can cost up to £150,000 and many are aggressive towards both males and females of the same species. ‘I'm looking for the right personality in a female, between six and eight years old,’ he said. ‘If she hates humans or rhinos we've got a problem, you can't just nip off to Tescos and grab one.’","Rhino originally found after being mauled by a rival bull .

A fearsome fanged reptile that roamed the Earth about 265 million years ago - before the age of the dinosaurs - has been unearthed in southern Brazil by scientists. The skull of the predator was dug up from a farm in the pampas plains of  Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil, after scientists spotted a bare patch on Google Maps and flew over to investigate. The dog-sized predator lived about 40 million years before the dinosaurs - and belonged to a family of reptiles that died out, leaving no descendants. Pampaphoneus hunting a pareiasaur: The remains, found in Brazil, are of a predator that roamed the plains before the dinosaurs . The Pampaphonius skull found by Dr Julian Cisneros, with a drawing showing what the complete skull would have looked like. The predator would have stalked other animals . Named Pampaphoneus biccai, it was a dinocephalian - a member of the family of anteosaurs that looked like dinosaurs but died out before the dinosaurs arrived. It would have been cold-blooded, using its powerful jaws to rip chunks off prey while still alive. The pampas are the flatlands of south America, - and ‘phoneus’ is Greek for 'killer'. Although Pampaphoneus biccai was found in modern-day Brazil, it came from a time when all the continents were fused together into one land mass called Pangaea. The family of creatures previously known to exist only in Russia, Kazakhstan, China and South Africa, but the latest discovery, described in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests the creature was more widespread. Dr Julian Cisnero's team investigate a layer of fossil-bearing soil in Brazil . About the size of a large dog, Pampaphoneus biccai's large teeth would have been able to rip prey to shreds . Palaeontologist Dr Juan Carlos Cisneros, of the Federal University of Piaui in Teresina, Brazil, said: ''This fossil is a member of the carnivorous Anteosaurs and provides evidence for Pangea-wide distribution of carnivorous dinocephalians.'Ohter dinocephalians included the South African Anteosaurus magnificus and the Russian Titanophoneus potens which were the largest - more than 18ft long - terrestrial predators of the age known geologically as the Permian.The researchers believe a barrier free connection would have allowed the beasts’ migration from Laurasia and Gondwana - the northernmost parts of Pangea - to the southern tip of the continent. At the end of the Permian period virtually all life became extinct in an environmental catastrophe of a magnitude never seen before or since. All over the world complex ecosystems were destroyed with only five per cent of species surviving what is now believed to be massive and prolonged volcanic eruptions that lasted for 500,000 years.","Cold-blooded predator would have ripped chunks out of prey while still alive .

A metal thief was killed by a 33,000-volt shock as he tried to steal copper from an electricity substation, an inquest heard. Father-of-three Gary Lawton, 46, was left for dead by at least one accomplice after being injured. It was several hours later before his body was found by an engineer who went to investigate a fault at the scene in Chesterton, Staffordshire. The inquest was told unemployed Mr Lawton had told his partner that he and a friend had found themselves a 'nice little earner' in the hours before he died. Although police believe he was not alone when he targeted the substation, there was not enough evidence to arrest anyone in connection with the raid. Coroner Ian Smith condemned the thief who left Mr Lawton, from Hanley, Staffordshire, to die. Recording a verdict of accidental death, he said: 'Gary was up to no good, he was out to steal copper. It is clear to me another person, possibly more, were involved. 'I am satisfied they did not cause or want Gary's death, but equally they weren't man or men enough to remain at the scene and tell the police what had happened or assist paramedics.' The inquest heard Mr Lawton's body was found next to a concrete pillar after the raid on April 25. A ladder was found nearby and a bolt-cutter, used to cut through metal, was also next to him. Scenes of crime officer Marcus Barber, from Staffordshire Police, said: 'Thick copper earthing strips run down the outside of the concrete. 'That particular concrete pylon was missing copper from quite a height. There were many other pylons with damage to them.' Around half a dozen two-foot long pieces of copper had been piled up by the substation's perimeter fence. Mr Lawton, who had three children with partner Donna Eagles, was pronounced dead at the scene. He had suffered burns and abrasions to various parts of his body. A post-mortem examination gave his cause of death as electrocution. A spokesman for Western Power urged people to keep out of electricity substations. 'Substations are lethal and the thieves are dicing with death for very small reward,' he said.","Gary Lawton, 46, left for dead by an accomplice .

The ‘Butcher of Brooklyn’ accused of killing a boy is a schizophrenic whose horrific actions were in part down to inbreeding, his lawyers claim.

But Aron's defence team claimed he is ‘either evil or crazy’ and said the defendant suffered a severe head injury from a bicycle accident aged 10. 'Brooklyn Butcher': Levi Aron, 35, of Brooklyn, New York, is accused of kidnapping Hasidic eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky in July before brutally murdering him . Lawyer Howard Greenberg said: ‘Everybody knows when blood relations have offspring there can be genetic defects', reported the New York Post.

Los Angeles beach goers out enjoying the holiday weekend were reminded of the sacrifices that are sometimes needed to safeguard our independence. Stretched out on the sands of the city’s main beach, Santa Monica, were rows and rows of painted wooden crosses, set up by volunteers with Veterans for Peace. Group member David Troy said: ‘This is about the human cost of war, both sides,’ as he squinted from the glare of the beach under his blue visor. Veterans for Peace: Every Sunday, volunteers set out hundreds of crosses and faux coffins on the beach in Santa Monica, California, to honour recent U.S. war dead . Memory: Each red cross represents 10 lost American soldiers, while each white one stands for one . Vocal veteran: David Troy volunteers with Veterans for Peace in Santa Monica, California . Every Sunday for the past seven years, Mr Troy, 67, has been coming out to this California beach, just north of the world-famous pier and its amusement park. Mr Troy and other volunteers with Veterans for Peace hit the beach around 2 am each Sunday, when they plant hundreds of wooden crosses in the sand, setting up what they call Arlington West, a nod to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. Mr Troy has a well-trimmed white beard, and wore a shirt that read ‘1,500 and counting. How many more?’ Except he had placed a sticker that reads ‘6,100’ over the 1,500. ‘One out of two Iraqis have been killed or displaced, but they don’t tell us that’, Mr Troy rattled statistics off to passersby, most of whom were decked out in bikinis and flip flops, ready for a fun day at the beach. ‘We’re sending $924million a week to Halliburton’, he told a group of young women who wandered by, and stared back blankly. Mr Troy said he joined Veterans for . Peace just two months after it was founded in 1985, as a group that . brings together veterans interested in working toward alternatives to . war. Memorial: More than 6,000 American servicemen and women have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan . Los Angeles beach goers stroll past the temporary memorial, taking in the sight . Some of the crosses have personal notes and photos to remember specific soldiers. A plaque points out that it would take more space to recognize Iraqi deaths . Mr Troy pointed to the rows of crosses in the sand, and said, ‘This is welfare for the rich, that’s what this is’. He said he thought the Iraq War was all about oil. ‘I’m 67 and I bike and rollerblade as much as I can. But do they?’ he asked, pointing to the throngs of happy beach goers. ‘Wake up people!’ he shouted. Mr Troy explained that each red cross represents 10 dead American soldiers, while each white one stands for one man or woman. That makes for hundreds of crosses, because some 6,026 American soldiers have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan to date, according to the Washington Post’s Faces of the Fallen project. That’s 4,442 deaths in Iraq and 1,584 in Afghanistan. Arlington West: Veterans for Peace named the memorial after Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia . Our hero: Snapshots and a touching note honour a fallen soldier . Many faiths: Some sickles are used to represent Muslim soldiers, while stars represent Jewish soldiers . This man in soldier's garb said he was 'observing' the memorial, and that he hoped it would make people think . ‘We started with crosses, but maybe we should have done tombstones’, Mr Troy said. ‘It’s not a Christian memorial, it’s meant to honour the cost of war’. To help make the point that the U.S. military is increasingly diverse, Veterans for Peace also sets out sickles for Islam and Stars of David for Judaism, in place of some of the crosses. The group sets up representations of flag-draped coffins to represent the military dead for the week. Last week, when we visited, there were four coffins to stand in for the 14 service people who died that week. Mr Troy added: ‘We’d need a whole lot more crosses if we were going to represent the Iraqi dead’. Passerby Pete Maughan, 30, said: ‘I think it’s really cool they are expressing how they feel about the war. My brother is in Iraq. It’s crazy. ‘One of these crosses could potentially be him. But I feel confident that it’s not going to be, not at this stage’. With many children playing on the beach, one wonders if they ask their parents what the memorial means . Tearing down: Volunteers remove the crosses for storage, until the following Sunday, when they are reused . A man in U.S. army fatigues walked by the crosses, and said he was ‘observing’. He asked not to be named for security reasons, but said, ‘All memorials are good. People may get a better understanding of war’. The man in fatigues said he had served three months in Afghanistan, but that he was currently serving civilian duty locally. When the shadows got long on the beach, volunteers began to stack up the wooden crosses, sickles and Stars of David. No one knows how many they will have to set out next week, but everyone hopes it won’t be any more.","On Sundays, wood crosses and faux coffins are set out in Santa Monica .

A former boxer wanted for killing a 36-year-old Connecticut woman early Tuesday morning has been found shot dead in his Rockville home, police said. Philip Gilberti, 51, is believed to have fired the fatal shot himself. Police said they found his gun lying close to his body. Detectives on Tuesday launched an urgent 100-strong manhunt to try to find him in connection with the death of his ex-wife, Heather Lynn McGuire earlier that day. Violent: Police hunting Joseph Gilberti in connection with the shooting of his ex-wife found him dead. He had a dark history of violence and was once a professional boxer . She was shot dead at around 9.40am on Tuesday. Police believe she was driving in a van with Gilberti when they had an argument, making him the lead suspect in her death. At least one witness reported that it looked like the woman tried to get out but that the man pulled her back in and shot her, he said. After the woman fell to the road, the van sped off. Bystanders, and later police officers, tried to save McGuire as she lay in the street, but she died at the scene. In the three days before the shooting, Gilberti was twice taken into custody after allegedly threatening McGuire. Both times he was released on bond on orders that he remain away from her.

Greek MPs finally approved key austerity measures yesterday as dozens of police and protesters were injured on a second day of bloody riots in Athens. Police fought running battles with demonstrators who were armed with petrol bombs, bricks and sticks. Officers responded by firing tear gas which filled the air in Syntagma Square, outside the parliament.

An Army officer in Washington state threatened to blow up the state capitol, personally kill his girlfriend, and hired a hit man for $150,000 to kill his estranged wife and his superior officer. Lt. Col. Robert E. Underwood, who was arrested Monday night and pleaded not guilty to felony harassment charges, was stationed at the same base as the soldier who made headlines over the weekend for allegedly killing 16 Afghan civilians in a shooting spree. Underwood threatened to kill girlfriend Serena Kiptoo after she confronted him about a naked photograph of his daughter on his laptop computer. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . High alert: Joint Base Lewis-McChord just outside of Seattle, Washington was the home to Lt. Col. Robert E. Underwood- who was arrested Monday night after allegedly hiring a hit man to kill his ex-wife and superior officer . Court documents say that he then told her that he'd paid a hit man $150,000 to kill both his wife and superior officer. He was charged with three counts of felony harassment and is being held in the Pierce County jail on $250,000 bail after entering a not guilty plea during his Superior Court arraignment on Tuesday. Investigation: The base is now being scrutinized as it was also the base of the soldier accused of killing 16 civilians in Afghanistan . Though he also reportedly threatened to blow up the Washington State Capitol when he was arrested, he was not charged with any crimes relating to the threat. ‘That's what the evidence supports, that's what we can prove, but it's an ongoing investigation,’ Pierce County prosecutor Mark Lindquist said. Underwood and his wife have been going through a divorce, and recent court hearings regarding money and custody of their children had not gone in his favor. His estranged wife, Kara Underwood, told the court that he had told their daughter ‘he was going to do something crazy and it would be on the news, the world would know about’. She saw this as a feasible threat . because ‘has nothing to lose, he has an arsenal of weapons and she . believes he has the ability to save the $150,000 and hide it.’ It . is not clear whether or not Underwood had actually hired a hit man . before he was arrested, though that is still being investigated. ‘The . victims obviously had a concern that he meant it, but we don't know . what steps, if any, were actually taken,’ Mr Lindquist said. Underwood faces up to five years in prison, but standard sentencing range would be between four and twelve months, he said. Mr . Lindquist said Underwood has been deployed multiple times and the . military has concluded he does not suffer PTSD, though there may be . other mental health issues to be considered. Next target: When he was arrested, Underwood allegedly threatened to blow up the state Capitol of Olympia . According to court documents, Underwood witnessed his mother kill his two siblings when he was a young child, and she shot Underwood multiple times and left him for dead. The arrest is adding more scrutiny to the troubled Joint Base Lewis-McChord as it is the same one that produced the soldier at the heart of the Afghanistan shooting. The name of the 38-year-old soldier in custody at a base in Kandahar has not been released pending charges. The soldier was deployed to Afghanistan on December 3 with the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Authorities did not release information about Underwood's unit and a Lewis-McChord spokesman did not immediately provide that information. WATCH VIDEO HERE .","Lt. Col. Robert E.

An estate which has been home to one of England’s most famous aristocrat families for centuries is in 'severe financial difficulties', a court has heard. Trustees of the Savernake Estate near Marlborough, Wiltshire - home to the Earl of Cardigan - told of the 'urgency of the situation' at a High Court hearing in London. Lawyers gave details of the estate’s cash problems during a dispute over the ownership of about 40 paintings of the earl’s ancestors. Concerns: A court has heard that Savernake Estate near Marlborough, Wiltshire is in 'severe financial difficulties' Trustees want to sell the paintings but the earl - David Brudenell-Bruce, 59 - objects. He claims that he is entitled to 'use of the paintings' under the terms of a lease and wants to stop trustees selling them. Trustees dispute his claim and say the paintings are not part of the lease. Mr Justice Newey was given an insight into the background to the dispute in written legal submissions prepared by lawyers representing trustees. 'This dispute arose because of the estate’s severe financial difficulties,' said Penelope Reed QC, for the trustees, in the written submissions. 'The trustees urgently need to sell the paintings.' She said a question the judge had to decide was whether estate 'chattels' - which included paintings, silver and furniture - were 'vested in the trustees' or part of a lease granted to the earl. Dispute: The Savernake Estate is home to the Earl of Cardigan, David Brudenell-Bruce, 48, pictured . The earl’s name is renowned because of the part played by an ancestor in one of the most famous attacks in military history - the Charge of the Light Brigade. Details can be found on the Savernake Estate website, which explains: 'In 1854, during the Crimean War, a very distant cousin of the Savernake Forest family was told that his commander-in-chief had ordered him and his men to mount a cavalry charge on some distant Russian cannons. 'Though he naturally queried the written order, he was again ordered to carry it out, which he reluctantly did - and so James, Earl of Cardigan and his Light Brigade passed into famous history.' The website says the estate is set in Savernake Forest, between Marlborough and Hungerford, and is privately owned by the earl and family trustees. It says the 4,500-acre woodland is the only privately-owned forest in Britain. An estate history on the website says Savernake Forest 'cannot be less than 1,000 years old' and is referred to in a Saxon charter from King Athelstan in 934AD and called Safernoc. The website says there were four buildings called Tottenham House on the southern edge of the forest. The present stately home was built in 1820, it adds. It says the family lived in Tottenham House until 1940. After the Second World War ended, they moved to a smaller house on the estate. The earl told the judge earlier in the hearing that the Savernake Estate had been in his family for '31 generations, for 1,000 years'. He said his 'every waking thought' centred on how he could preserve the estate for the 'next generation'.","Trustees of the Savernake Estate in Wiltshire tell the High Court of the 'urgency of the situation'

Kellaway faked his death during a family holiday to Russia, where his wife had breast enlargement surgery. He bribed a Moscow mortuary worker . with a bottle of vodka to place his passport on a dead tramp and got his . wife to identify the body as his. He later fled to Bangkok using a . false passport in the name of a boy who had died, and lived off the . rental income from his £1million London property portfolio. The father of two planned to bring . his family out to Thailand to live with him by cashing in three life . insurance policies worth £1.7million. However his time on the run came to an end when the Mail discovered he was alive and confronted him. Caught on camera: Stephen Kellaway, pictured in Bangkok, faked his own death while visiting Russia with his wife Nelli before fleeing to Thailand . Thai authorities later deported the . 54-year-old back to Britain where he admitted a string of benefits fraud . and false documentation offences. Yesterday, jailing him for two years . and eight months at Croydon Crown Court, Judge Shani Barnes said he had . carried out a ‘cynical and selfish plan’. She said: ‘It struck at the very . heart of the benefits system. People such as yourself who criminally . steal from those who rely on benefits and from the taxpayers who pay for . them, undermine that system and demolish its credibility.’ Hammersmith and Fulham Council, which . brought the prosecution, praised the Mail for helping to bring Kellaway . to justice, describing our role as ‘British investigative journalism at . its very best.’ Kellaway slept rough in the lounge of Bangkok Airport, while his wife went home from Russia to claim his life insurance . Kellaway began planning his scam in . 2008 after being inspired by the case of fraudster John Darwin, who fled . to Panama after supposedly dying in a canoe accident. Kellaway at one point earned £100,000 . a year from his counselling service in West London. He and his . Russian-born wife Nelli, 42, owned five houses and flats which the court . heard made money in ‘large measures’ through rent and rising house . prices. But to help pay their multiple . mortgages and children’s school fees, they also fraudulently claimed . housing benefit on their portfolio. Realising the net was closing in on . them, they went on holiday to Russia, where Mrs Kellaway had her breast . operation. The ‘widow’ was arrested as she returned to London in . November 2008 carrying an urn which she claimed contained Kellaway’s . ashes and his three life insurance policies. She later convinced a court that her . ‘abusive’ husband had forced her into the fraud and escaped with a . suspended sentence. Meanwhile Kellaway used the birth certificate of a . seven-year-old from Belfast who died of heart problems to get an Irish . passport. The fraudulent death certificate of Stephen Kellaway, who faked his death to escape jail for his part in a fraud worth £43,000 . He returned to the UK under his new . identity, and was spotted  several times visiting his parents in . Brighton, before jetting off to Sri Lanka and then to Thailand. In Bangkok, he lived on rental income . he received from the UK for several months before he was mugged and . lost his false passport – meaning he had no identification to collect . his payments. When the Mail caught up with him last . summer he was living rough at the city’s airport and begging for food. He admitted his fraud, explaining: ‘Parts of my life on the run were . very James Bond, but parts were also very squalid, and I wouldn’t . recommend what I have done.’ Kellaway admitted three counts of benefit fraud and possession and use of a false identification document yesterday. Judge Barnes described his scam and . fake death as ‘well thought out and professional.’ She said: ‘You . planned it in a way that was persistent and intelligent. You used a . false identification to cynically hide your real identification from the . police and avoid detection for your abject dishonesty. ‘What a sorry mess this all is.’","Couple claimed benefits despite owning five properties in London and sending their children to private school .

A motorist was stunned when he discovered double yellow lines had been painted underneath his car while it was parked - and then given a ticket. Flecks of yellow paint were even sprayed on the bumper of Patrick McCrystal's car as the lines were painted under the front of it in Kedleston Street, Derby. The 49-year-old had parked his Ford Fiesta in the street near to a Co-operative store and a petrol station, where he works, for three years. Stunned: Patrick McCrystal with his Ford Fiesta, which was given a ticket after council workmen had sprayed yellow lines under the car while it was parked legally . When he parked for his 2pm shift, he noticed new yellow lines had been painted across a housing block entrance. But there was a gap between those lines and existing ones in the street, so Mr McCrystal parked there, in his usual spot. Hours later, a colleague on his dinner break saw that extra lines had been painted below the front of Mr McCrystal's car. And, when he went out, Mr McCrystal discovered he had been given a parking ticket. Tell-tale sign: The workmen left flecks of paint on the bumper of the car as they sprayed underneath . He said: 'There is even paint on my front bumper where they've caught it reaching under to paint the lines. 'There were no lines there when I parked. I can't believe they've done it.' The new lines extended from existing double yellow lines which had previously ended about two feet from Mr McCrystal's front bumper. Apology: The ticket left on Mr McCrystal's window. Derby City Council blamed a breakdown in communication and has now revoked the £70 fine . Now a Derby City Council official has said the £70 fine had been issued in error and would be revoked. Mr McCrystal, from Derby, said notices had been put up several weeks ago saying parking restrictions would be introduced but they did not say when. He said: 'If they were going to paint yellow lines then they should have put up cones to stop people parking. 'When I pulled up, I saw the gap between the old lines and the new ones and thought it was okay to park there. Nothing gave me the impression I couldn't.' A passer-by said council staff had been angered they could not paint the lines because of the parked car. David Gartside, head of traffic and transport at the authority, said: 'We can confirm that lining was painted on Kedleston Street this afternoon after the vehicle had parked and that a parking ticket was issued to the vehicle in error. 'It appears that there was a communication breakdown between our contractors undertaking the lining work and our enforcement officers. 'The ticket will be revoked and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.'",They even sprayed paint on his Ford Fiesta in calamitous giveaway .

A dog which fell down a 30ft mine shaft was pulled out uninjured by rescuers - after being stuck there for nine days. Collie-cross Peppa slipped down the hole while chasing a scent during a morning walk with owner Audrey Binding. She returned to the spot every day for a week to look for Peppa and eventually called in a search team from the Four Paws Animal Rescue charity as a 'last-ditch attempt'. Ruff deal: Collie-cross Peppa looks a bit worse for wear, but is otherwise uninjured after being pulled out of a 30ft mine shaft after surviving for nine days on underground water . Amazingly, rescuer Simon Wall, 47, managed to find Peppa on a ledge 8ft down the shaft after just two hours of searching - and pulled her out. It is believed that Peppa - who lost almost 5lbs during her ordeal - survived by drinking water at the bottom of the mine shaft. Delighted Audrey, of Winscombe, Somerset, said she was 'over the moon' Peppa was found. She said: 'There had been no sightings for nine days so it was tough to keep my hopes up. I honestly thought the search party would find her dead. 'When I stopped crying, I was just so so pleased to see her I couldn’t stop hugging her. It’s more than a miracle in my books.' Dogged survival: Peppa gets a reassuring cuddle from one of her rescuers from the Four Paws Animal Rescue charity, which had been called in to help with the search by her desperate owner Audrey Binding . Simon, of Blackwood, Wales, said: 'It looks like Peppa fell right to the bottom of the shaft, but then managed to scramble her way up. 'She was hungry and thirsty, but must have found subterranean water at the bottom, otherwise she would have been dead after nine days.' Peppa first went missing on the morning of March 2 as she was walked on the Strawberry Line disused train route in North Somerset. Audrey combed the woods with locals and other dog owners for a week before enlisting the help of Four Paws Animal Rescue. A group of 13 dog owners and their pets arrived at Banwell Woods, near Sandford, on March 11, splitting off into groups to cover the area. Property manager Simon, 47, began calling out to his four border collies as he walked them around the woods - and was stunned to hear another dog barking back. He followed the noise to a 30ft deep and 25ft wide disused mine shaft and spotted Peppa balancing on a ledge 8ft below the surface. Simon said: 'I tried to reach her, but couldn’t so I tied three dog leads together and secured them to a strong root before lowering myself down. 'I was able to lean out to her and she reached towards me and I pulled her out by her harness. She was wagging her tail like mad.' Simon called other rescuers with the happy news and walked to Audrey with Peppa and his own dogs, Milo, Ben, Chico and Chipp. Peppa - who was completely uninjured by her ordeal - wolfed down a meal and water before being reunited with the rest of the search party. Simon added: 'It was like a lottery win, a £1 million win. Everyone was crying with joy because it was so unexpected.'","Collie-cross survived by drinking filthy water at the bottom of hole .

"Top speed of 212mph eclipses 205mph set by Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano . Can accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 3.1 seconds . By . Ray Massey . UPDATED: . 13:54 EST, 29 February 2012 . The fastest Ferrari ever was unveiled today – with a blistering price to match. The new Ferrari F12 Berlinetta  has a top speed of 212miles per hour but it’s the rocket like acceleration which is drawing gasps ahead of its official launch at next week’s Geneva Motor Show when it goes on sale. The scintillating two-seater roars from rest to 62mph in just  3.1 seconds – shaving 0.6 seconds off the car it replaces, the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano. And the Italian supercar will hit 124mph  in just 8.5 seconds, compared to 11 seconds for its predecessor. Start saving: The new Ferrari F12 Berlinetta costs £250,000 . Top Gear: The new F12 has a top speed of 212miles per hour . Top speed of 212mph is also faster than the 599’s 205mph.Ferrari said boldly: ‘This is the fastest Ferrari ever built.’ But that sort of performance also commands a  powerful price – with the production cars costing £250,000. The new car is powered by a vast 6.3 litre V12 naturally aspirated direct injection engine which develops 740 horsepower – more than seven Fiord Fiestas. It is available with a super-slock 7-speed Grand Prix style automatic dual clutch  gearbox with a manual override via F1-style paddles on the steering wheel. Wheel of fortune: The F12 steering wheel has Formula One paddles . Luxury: The interior design of the F12 is a result of the legendary Italian styling house Pininfarina . The new car is  finished in a new Ferrari red  ‘Rosso Berlinetta’ three-layer colour. Only the Ferrari Enzo of 2002 which sold originally for £365,000 but can now command up to £1m  has a faster absolute speed – of 217.5mph, But it could not accelerate as fast as the new car. By comparison, the Enzo could manage 0 to 62mph in ‘only’ 3.65 seconds. Ferrari said of the new F12 Berlinetta supercar: ‘This is, in fact, the most powerful and high-performance Ferrari road car ever launched thanks to the incredibly efficient engine.’‘Together with advanced vehicle architecture, aerodynamics, components and electronic controls, guarantee unsurpassed driving involvement whatever the road or track.’ The new car is also lighter than the one it replaces: ‘The overall result is a very compact car with a lower centre of gravity that is further back in the chassis, and a level of aerodynamic efficiency that sets new standards.’ The F12 is powered by a 6.3 engine which develops 740 horsepower – more than seven Fiord Fiestas . The bodyshell uses 12 different kinds of alloys and weighs 1.525 tonnes . The new supercar’s lightweight space-frame chassis and bodyshell uses 12 different kinds of alloys and uses new assembly and joining techniques which makes the car 20 per cent ‘stiffer.’ At 1.525 tonnes it is also 70 kg less than the previous V12 coupé. Fuel consumption has been reduced by 30 per cent , with CO2 emissions down from 415g/km to  ‘just’ 350 g/km. But Ferrari says these figures put the F12 Berlinetta ‘at the top of the high-performance league.’ These results have been obtained by extensive research and development which focused on efficiencies of the whole vehicle: engine, aerodynamics, tyres and weights. Aerodynamics play a huge part in the car’s  improved performance. Out with the old: The Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano which cost an estimated £170,00 has been eclipsed by the new F12 model . Drag resistance has been significantly reduced by use of what the Italian car firm calls an ‘Aero Bridge.’ This uses the bonnet to generate downforce by channelling air away from the upper part of the car to its flanks. A second Active Brake Cooling, a system that opens  flaps to the brake cooling ducts only when the pads get hot. The result is that the new ‘Prancing Horse’  12-cylinder also completes a lap of the famous  Fiorano race-test circuit in 1 minute and 23 seconds - faster than any other Ferrari road car. Stopping distances have also been drastically reduced, says Ferrari. The design of the F12 Berlinetta  is a result of the collaboration between the Ferrari Styling Centre and legendary Italian styling house Pininfarina. Spot the difference: The tatty 1961 Ferrari 250 GTE was recently put up for sale and is expected to sell for £60,000 . The Gran Turismo car was Ferrari's first four-seater. Moving the engine, gearbox and steering gear forward and the fuel tank back left sufficient room for two occasional rear seats . Ferrari said: It is a perfect balance of uncompromising aerodynamics with harmonious proportions.’ Inside, Ferrari says:  ’The cockpit is designed around the driver. ‘ . But both driver and passenger is cossetted  in an all-new ‘Frau’ leather interior showcasing  both the car’s advanced technology and sophisticated, handcrafted detailing. In the middle of the light and lean dashboard, there are new carbon fibre and aluminium air vents clearly inspired by the aeronautic field. For couples heading off for a romantic weekend in Tuscany, additional luggage capacity behind the seats, which can also be easily reached via a large aperture offered by the tail-gate.","Top speed of 212mph eclipses 205mph set by Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano .

A Congolese warlord was today convicted of snatching children from the street and turning them into killers in the International Criminal Court's first judgment at the Hague in ten years. The actress Angelina Jolie was in the public gallery to see Thomas Lubanga sentenced, as he sat wearing an ivory-colored robe and skull cap with his hands clasped in front of him. The judges found Lubanga guilty of kidnaping youngsters from their families and using them as soldiers 2002-2003 in the armed wing of his political movement, the Union of Congolese Patriots. Lubanga was ruled to have 'personally used children below the age of 15 as his bodyguards'. Congolese militia chief Thomas Lubanga smiles and shakes the hand of a member of his legal team in the International Criminal Court in the Hague before his conviction today . Angelina Jolie, pictured at her Amsterdam hotel today, was int he public gallery at The Hague to see Thomas Lubanga sentenced . Ms Jolie was thrilled with the verdict. She said afterwards: 'This is their day - where these children will feel . there is no impunity for what happened to them, for what they . suffered.' Presiding judge Adrian Fulford said: 'The prosecution has proved beyond . reasonable doubt that Mr. Thomas Lubanga is guilty of the crimes of . conscripting and enlisting children under the age of 15 years and using . them to participate actively in hostilities.' As he left court flanked by guards, Lubanga nodded and smiled to supporters in the public gallery. A sentencing hearing will now be scheduled. He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. While the three-judge panel unanimously convicted Lubanga, it also harshly criticised prosecutors as 'negligent' for using intermediaries to deal with witnesses in Congo. Fulford said three intermediaries . 'persuaded, encouraged or assisted witnesses to give false evidence' and . scrapped the evidence of three witnesses. 'The . Prosecutor's office must review its limited investigation strategy . adopted in the Lubanga case, especially in light of such decisions . precluding victims from participating in trials and obtaining . reparation,' said Michael Bochenek of Amnesty International. 'Lessons need to be learned for future cases.' Amnesty . also criticised the court for not charging Lubanga with sexual violence . crimes, saying the decision potentially denied 'justice and reparation . to many more victims.' However, . other witnesses and video of Lubanga speaking to recruits, some of them . children, at a training camp provided enough evidence to convict him. Prosecutors said Lubanga recruited the children fight in a brutal ethnic conflict in the Ituri region of eastern Congo. Under armed guard: Lubanga during a rally in the Congo in 2003, left, and Aime Dieudonne, right, one of the young combatants recruited to fight for the rebel Union for Congolese Patriots, also pictured in 2003 . The trial, which began in January . 2009, is the first at an international court to focus exclusively on the . use of child soldiers and activists say it should send a clear message . to armies and rebels around the world that conscripting children . breaches international law. The . United Nations estimates tens of thousands of child soldiers are still . fighting in conflicts from Africa to Asia and Latin America. 'The . guilty verdict against Lubanga is a strong warning to military . commanders in Congo and elsewhere - using children as a weapon of war is . a serious crime that can lead them to the dock,' said Geraldine . Mattioli-Zeltner of Human Rights Watch. The first verdict is a coming of age for . the court set up to prosecute war crimes suspects in countries unable . or unwilling to try them. Child fighter: Another young recruit for the UPC in the Congolese town of Bunia is watched by a United Nations armoured personnel carrier . So far, prosecutors have opened seven investigations and have just five suspects in custody, including former Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo and former Congo Vice President Jean-Pierre Bemba. However, questions still remain about the its effectiveness. The court has no police force to arrest suspects and can only launch investigations in the 120 countries that recognise its jurisdiction, or if the Security Council orders a probe. That means that the court is powerless to intervene in the bloody conflict tearing Syria apart because Damascus has not recognised the court and the Security Council is bitterly divided. The inability of the court to have suspects arrested turned into a global online sensation last week with the release of the Kony 2012 video by American activists, which highlighted the case of notorious Ugandan rebel Joseph Kony, the first person indicted by the court who remains a fugitive more than six years later.",First conviction in ten years by the International Criminal Court .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:29 EST, 8 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:12 EST, 8 March 2012 . Smoking among America's youth has reached epidemic proportions, starting them on the path to a lifetime of addiction, according to the U.S. surgeon general's office. Among U.S. high school seniors, one in four is a regular cigarette smoker, and because few high school smokers are able to quit, some 80 percent will continue to smoke as adults,  the office says in its first report on youth smoking since 1994. 'Today, more than 600,000 middle school students and 3 million high school students smoke. We don't want our children to start something now that they won't be able to change later in life,' Surgeon General Dr. Regina Benjamin said. U.S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin speaks at a news conference releasing the report 'Preventing Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young Adults today . An estimated 3,800 kids pick up their first cigarette every day and 9 in 10 current smokers started before the age of 18. Some 99 percent of all first-time tobacco use happens by the age of 26, exposing young people to the long-term health effects of smoking, such as lung cancer and heart disease. 'This report highlights the urgent need to employ proven methods nationwide that prevent young people from smoking and encourage all smokers to quit. One in four U.S. high school   seniors is a regular smoker. 80 percent will continue to smoke as adults. More than 600,000 middle school students and 3 million high school students smoke. An estimated 3,800 kids pick up their first cigarette every day . 9 in 10 current smokers started before the age of 18. 99 percent of all first-time tobacco use happens by the age of 26 . Smoking kills more than 1,200 people every day. For every tobacco-related death, two new 'replacement' smokers under the age of 25 take up the habit. 'Including passage of smoke-free laws, increases in tobacco excise taxes and fully funded tobacco prevention programs,'John Seffrin, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said. Although U.S. smoking rates have fallen since 1964, when the surgeon general issued the first health warnings on smoking, progress in curbing youth smoking has stalled in the past decade just as marketing efforts aimed at youth continues to climb. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 1,200 people every day. And for every tobacco-related death, two new 'replacement' smokers under the age of 25 take up the habit. The report criticized tobacco companies for targeting youth, saying the industry spends more than $1 million an hour - over $27 million per day - in marketing and promoting tobacco products. This chart, produced in a study by the University of Michigan, shows the percentage of smoking among 8th, 10th and 12th graders between 2002 and 2007 . This chart, produced in a study by the National Survey on Drug Use, shows the percentage of smoking among young adults aged 18-25 in 2010 . According to the report, advertising messages that make smoking appealing to young people are widespread, and advertising for tobacco products is prominently displayed in retail stores and online. 'Targeted marketing encourages more young people to take up this deadly addiction every day,' U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement. 'This administration is committed to doing everything we can do to prevent our children from using tobacco.' Tobacco companies are spending more than $10 billion a year marketing their products - almost double the amount they spent in 1998 - but they have also stepped up their efforts to block policies aimed at reducing smoking, said Danny McGoldrick, vice president for research at the Campaign for Tobacco-free Kids. According to the report, advertising messages that make smoking appealing to young people are widespread . He pointed to tobacco companies' victory last week in federal court blocking a requirement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to add graphic warning labels to cigarette packs. McGoldrick said tobacco marketing expenditures have risen in spite of restrictions imposed by the 1998 legal settlement between U.S. states and the tobacco companies. 'We have a constant battle on our hands,' McGoldrick said by telephone. Much of tobacco marketing dollars concentrates on convenience stores, he said. Studies show that two-thirds of U.S. teenagers visit such retail outlets at least once a week and the price discounts and exposure to tobacco advertising increase youth smoking. An estimated 3,800 kids pick up their first cigarette every day and 9 in 10 current smokers started before the age of 18 . Tobacco companies were quick to defend their practices. Altria Group, parent of companies Philip Morris USA, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco and John Middleton, said it markets to adults who use to tobacco through age-verified direct communications and in retail stores. 'The vast majority of our marketing expenditures come in the form of price promotions,' the company said in a statement. Altria said its tobacco companies worked to help enact the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009, noting it was one of the few tobacco companies that did. But U.S. public health officials said more is needed to curb youth smoking. 'We can and must continue to do more to accelerate the decline in youth tobacco use,' Dr. Howard Koh, assistant secretary for health at HHS said in a statement. ""Until we end the tobacco epidemic, more young people will become addicted, more people will die and more families will be devastated by the suffering and loss of loved ones.'

The adoring parents of a two-year-old were horrified when they were told their son was a health and safety risk because he is too tall. Staff at the Jolly Roger Adventure play centre in Swindon, Wiltshire, said Dylan Kennedy and Amanda Sparks would have to pay extra for son Oliver to attend the nursery because he is 3ft 3ins (100cm) tall. Managers said that, at five-and-a-half inches (14cm) above the average height for a child his age, Oliver would 'wear out equipment faster' than the other toddlers. Wrong fit: Amanda Sparks was told she would have to pay extra for son Oliver to attend the Jolly Roger Adventure play centre because he is taller than an average toddler . Mrs Sparks, 24, was told that she would have to pay a full child price of £3.60 for Oliver instead . of the under-four admission fee of £2.20. The youngster's angry parents have hit back at the play centre, saying their son was being discriminated against because he had grown slightly faster than most children his age. Mr Kennedy, 30, said: 'Ollie is tall for his age but, because he is asthmatic, he has had to take steroids from a young age which has probably made him grow a bit quicker. 'To me it just seems like complete discrimination against my son for being tall. 'He is only two so he is definitely still a toddler. I would say you probably stop being a toddler at about four years old, when you start school. 'They go there almost every week and he even had his second birthday party there last year. Unfair: Oliver, who is 5.5in taller than the average two-year-old, is allowed to play in the same area as other toddlers but his parents must pay extra for the privilege . 'On their latest visit, Amanda went to pay the normal toddler price and was told she would have to pay more. 'She paid it because she didn’t want Ollie to know she was disappointed because he was so excited. But when they queried it afterwards with the manager they were told, ""If you have a tall child then it is just tough"".' Appalled: Oliver's mother was told her son was a 'health and safety risk' at 3ft 3in (100cm) tall . Mr Kennedy emailed the management team the same day and was told that the decision had been made for health and safety reasons. He added: 'It’s not really about the price, it is more about the attitude that we have been given.' A friend’s daughter, who is one month younger than Oliver, was able to enter as a toddler. Mrs Sparks said: 'Last time we measured him he was about 100cm tall, so he is quite tall for his age, but he does have these steroids, and I am quite tall too. 'When they measured him he just came right up to the line, but that was because his hair was all spiked up. 'It just seems unfair when my friend’s daughter, who is just a month younger than Oliver, is classed as a toddler. 'He can still play in the toddler area once he is inside because that is done on age, but the price is done on height, which doesn’t seem fair to me.' On the Jolly Roger website it states that the toddlers' area is exclusively for children under four years old or 95cm in height. Oliver will not be three for another two months, but already exceeds the specified height by 5cm. Manager John Bolton said: 'We do go by height at Jolly Roger - a bigger child would wear the equipment out quicker than a smaller child would. 'But if an older child wants to play with their younger brother or sister in the toddler area then we wouldn’t stop this, as we want the children to be happy and play together, so we can mix and match. 'We would never stop friends playing together because of their height - that is not what we are about. 'We try to be as accommodating as we can and make the play areas as safe as possible.'","Oliver plays in same area as other two-year-olds, but is charged extra ."

'Night of terror': Manhattan socialite Anne Bass was held for 12 hours in the 2007 ransom attempt at her country retreat in Connecticut . Anne Bass’s boyfriend told a court how he thought he would die when three men ‘dressed like ninjas’ broke into the philanthropist's mansion and 'poisoned' the power couple. Julian Lethbridge testified in court on the first day of the trial of Bass’s ex-butler, Emanuel Nicolescu, who is accused of holding the pair hostage for 12 hours in her Connecticut estate and injecting them with a 'deadly virus'. Lethbridge, an artist, described the events of April 15 2007 to the jury. ‘It felt like a flu shot,’ he said. ‘They injected me by sterilizing my shoulder, exactly like an inoculation…I thought it was poisonous or they were putting me to sleep. ‘I couldn’t reconcile the fact that if I was being killed, why would they disinfect the injection site? ‘Then I heard the preparation and the same thing going on with Anne.’ Wielding a knife, one of the assailants announced that they had been injected with a ‘very virulent virus’ with symptoms taking 20-24 hours to appear. ‘When the symptoms appear, it’s almost certain to be fatal’ Lethbridge recalled the thugs saying. Masked assailants demanded that the philanthropist pay $8.5 million for an antidote within 20 hours. ‘I thought we were just going to die’ Lethbridge told the court. It was then, convinced they were both within hours of death, that Leftbridge told his girlfriend, ‘I love you, Anne’, according to prosecutor Paul McConnell. Torment: Anne Bass and her boyfriend, artist, Julian Lethbridge, (left) refused to give up the $8.5m demanded by attackers in 2007, and, Texan billionaire Sid Bass, who divorced from Anne in 1988 . Authorities say Nicolescu and at least . two other men broke into the house around 11 p.m. on . the estate spanning several hundred acres in the western Connecticut . town of Kent. The 69-year-old Bass, former wife of Texas billionaire Sid . Bass, also has homes in New York and Fort Worth, Texas. Prosecutors told the court that Bass . had just taken a bath and Lethbridge was falling asleep when he heard ‘a . loud crashing noise and a sound like boots running up steps.’ The break-in happened while Bass’ 3-year-old grandson, Jasper, was sleeping in another room. Bass tried to bar the invaders from getting in through the kitchen door but they succeeded in forcing their way in. They then blindfolded the victims, bound their hands with zip ties and took them to a bathroom where they administered the 'poison.' He told the . men Bass did not keep that sum of money in the house and that she would . have to contact associates out of state to get the money. At one point, . the assailants considered transporting one or both of the victims to New . York, according to an arrest affidavit. Prosecutors said that Nicolescu, his former roomate Nicolae Helerea, aka Michael Kennedy, and Stefan Barabas talked on either cellphones or two-way radios. After . about five hours in the house, the men became concerned with the . presence of the child, the health of the victims and their apparent . inability to immediately obtain the money, the affidavit says. Before . fleeing, the men gave the victims a beverage that they claimed was the . antidote and the victims fell asleep. Bass and her guest were later treated at a hospital. Luxury pad: The sprawling Connecticut retreat where Anne Bass and her boyfriend were held captive for 12 hours . Nicolescu . had been in charge of the estate's household staff and provided housing . on the property, but his employment was terminated months before the . home invasion, according to authorities. After the attack, his DNA was allegedly found in a Jeep that was stolen from the family and taken to New York. Nicolescu's . attorney said in court papers filed Tuesday that the attempted . extortion charges should be dismissed because federal authorities lack . jurisdiction. Nicolescu's attorneys say the law allows federal . prosecution of robbery or extortion that interferes with interstate . commerce but the crime lacks such an apparent link 'other than the fact . that one of the victims is extremely wealthy.' Nicolescu's lawyer Audrey Felsen told jurors that the butler 'did not do the crimes.He did not particpate in them, He din;t plan them. He didn't help anybody plan them. He didn't knowingly help anybody after the fact.' Nicolescu . was born in Romania and came to the United States after his father . sought political asylum as a refugee, his attorney said, according to . court papers. Nicolescu has Romanian and U.S. citizenship. He has . been detained since his arrest in Chicago last year. A judge called him a . flight risk, saying he has strong ties overseas and faces a long . sentence if convicted. Nicolescu is charged with attempted . extortion, conspiracy to commit extortion, and possession of a stolen . vehicle. He faces up to 50 years in prison if convicted at the trial . beginning Wednesday. About six days after the crime, an accordion . case washed ashore in New York that included a stun gun, knife, black . plastic airsoft gun, crowbar, syringes, sleeping tablets, green latex . gloves and a laminated telephone card labeled with the address of the . victim.

Amanda Jolliff, 37, pleaded guilty to false imprisonment and child abuse after police found the boy living in a rodent-infested mobile home in Erie, Colorado. Police said the boy's bedroom window was boarded up, and there was an outside lock on his bedroom door in which he had imprisoned for three and a half years.

Heartbreaking: Garde Champetre, 13, right, suffered a serious injury today and had to be destroyed. The horse is pictured here in 2008 . Another runner in the same race, Garde Champetre, was also destroyed after sustaining a similar injury. Officials later announced that a third . horse, Educated Evans, was to be put down after falling in the 2½-mile . novice chase – the final event of the day. The tragedies infuriated animal rights . groups. One, Animal Aid, warned that the ground was ‘dangerously firm’ and claimed races ‘should never have taken place’. Of the event that claimed the lives of . Scotsirish and Garde Champetre – the seven-furlong cross-country . handicap chase – a spokesman for the group said: ‘Rather than take the . precautionary step of calling off the race, officials risked the lives . of the horses, and two paid the ultimate price.’ The claims were vigorously denied by race organisers last night. They said the course and its obstacles had been inspected several times to ensure that it was safe. ‘It was watered and it was deemed . perfectly fine to race on by the course inspector,’ a British . Horseracing Authority spokesman said. The deaths are sure to reignite debate over whether horse-racing is an unnecessarily cruel sport. Before yesterday’s deaths, nine horses had been killed at the Cheltenham Festival between 2007 and 2011. In 2006, 11 horses were killed, including six on one day. Three of those came after the novice chase. Critics say the Festival puts horses under enormous pressure due to its big, noisy crowds and frenetic atmosphere. Fury: Animal welfare groups have reacted angrily following the deaths of the three horses on the first day's racing at the Cheltenham Festival . They also warn that many of the races feature too many horses, making it difficult  for the animals to judge  their jumps. However, race organisers say they take . horse safety ‘very seriously’ – and that campaign groups such as Animal . Aid are not welfare organisations, but ‘extremists’. A spokesman for . the BHA said: ‘Like most competitive sports, racing carries risks. No . one wants to see valuable and valued racehorses killed and injured. ‘It is regrettable that three horses . suffered accidents where the injury was not treatable and so euthanasia . was the proper and humane option. ‘Racecourses, horse-racing trainers . and the sport’s regulator are not complacent about these risks, and . recognise there is still more to do, including both on-going . improvements and scientific research, to further reduce these risks.’ Animal Aid said they planned to hold a protest at Cheltenham today to . remind racegoers of ‘the heavy price paid by horses’ at the event. A spokesman for the group said: ‘More . horses have been killed at Cheltenham Racecourse than at any other in . the country over the past five years – a little-known statistic that the . owners of the course will not be keen to share with the paying . punters.’ The Cheltenham Festival is not the . only racing event to have come under scrutiny in recent years. Five . horses were killed at last year’s Grand National meeting – the highest . death toll since 1997. The BBC was criticised for ‘barely . mentioning’ the deaths,  ‘concealing’ the grim reality of horse-racing . and presenting a ‘dishonest, sanitised picture’ of the sport to boost . overseas sales of the footage. At the time, the Corporation denied . taking part in any ‘cover-up’ and said its presenters always gave an . update on the condition of horses injured in a race.","Scotsirish, Garde Champetre and Educated Evans all died on the course which has claimed the lives of nine horses in five years .

This the secret document detailing Britain's offer to share the Falkland Islands with Argentina in 1974. Harold Wilson's Labour government approached President Juan Domingo Perón with a confidential plan for shared rule. But the deal, agreed by the then Argentine leader, was scuppered when he died just 20 days later. Britain was said not to trust his successor, his widow María Estela Martínez, and so cut contact with the South American country. Non-official: The document shows the offer from Harold Wilson's Labour government to President Perón . Plans: If the deal had gone through, it would have seen Argentine and British flags flying over the islands . Argentine newspaper La Nación today published what it said was a 'non-official document' from the British Foreign Office. It shows that Britain made the offer to then President Perón, whose second wife was the famous Eva, or Evita, on June 11, 1974. The . British Ambassador in Buenos Aires, James Hutton, gave Argentine . Foreign Minister Alberto Vignes the text in a secret meeting. The proposals would see both flags being flown over the islands, and Spanish and English being made dual official language. Documents: Britain secretly offered to share the Falkland Islands with Argentina in 1974, it has been sensationally claimed . Leaders: Juan Domingo Perón (left) is said to have agreed the deal but when he died Britain did not trust his widow Isabel (right) and so cut contact . A governor would also be put in place - . who would be decided, on a rotating basis, by the British monarch and . the Argentine President. The proposal would 'create a favourable atmosphere in which the islanders could develop according to their interests'. It would also 'put an end to the dispute over sovereignty'. Diplomatic tension: Relations between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 Falklands conflict . Tensions: Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de . Kirchner, left, has angered British Prime Minister David Cameron with some of her rhetoric . It concluded: 'Covering these terms, the government of her Majesty proposes that, if the Argentine government agrees, we should realise official conversations in Buenos Aires as soon as possible'. Perón is said to have reacted with 'euphoria', according to veteran diplomat Carlos Ortiz de Rozas who today spoke to La Nación. Perón is said to have told his confidante: 'We accept. Once we get a foot on the Falklands no-one will remove us. Shortly after the sovereignty will belong to Argentina alone.' War of words: In January Argentines branded Prince William a 'conqueror' after his six-week deployment to the Falkland Islands . But 20 days later he died and his ex-ballerina widow María Estela Marínez, known as Isable, was named as his successor. The British government is said not to have trusted her and so cut all contact, according to the former ambassador. The Foreign Office said discussions had taken place. A spokesman added: 'This does not detract from Argentina's illegal and unjustified act of aggression in invading the islands.' Tensions between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 Falklands conflict, which cost the lives of 255 British and 649 Argentine servicemen. It started to intensify in 2010, when oil exploration by British companies off the islands raised the stakes. Last month Downing Street accused Argentina of pursuing a 'policy of confrontation' over the islands, after reports suggested Argentina's industry minister called for all British imports to be banned. Anger: Argentina is renewing calls for the island to be handed to them . The Foreign and Commonwealth Office summoned an Argentinian envoy to London earlier this month to explain the proposed ban. It also wanted to know what happened when the South American state's government prevented two cruise ships from docking following a visit to the Falkland Islands last month. Britain recently deployed one of its most modern destroyers, HMS Dauntless, to the region, and although it insisted the move was merely routine, Argentina met with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the president of the UN Security Council after accusing Britain of  'militarising the South Atlantic.' Prince William's arrival in the Falklands for a posting as an RAF search and rescue pilot was a move which further infuriated Buenos Aires. Argentina has received the backing of Latin American countries for its claim of sovereignty of the islands, which were occupied by Britain in 1833.","Deal agreed with then President Juan Domingo Perón .

The faint scratchings of a reindeer with a spear in its neck date back 14,000 years. The cave art, nicknamed Rudolph by  archaeologists, was carved by a hunter-gatherer in the Ice Age. Experts are studying the discovery at a secret location on the Gower Peninsula, near Swansea. Found in Wales: The faint scratchings of a reindeer with a spear in its neck date back 14,000 years - Britain's oldest cave art . It was discovered by ‘pure chance’ by archaeologist Dr George Nash, who has been visiting the cave complex for more than 20 years. He said: ‘It was a strange moment of being in the right place at the right time with the right kit. ‘I’ve been taking students there for 20-odd years talking about what was going on there. ‘On this particular day they all went back to the bus but I decided to stay behind and have a snoop around in the cave. ‘Within a couple of minutes I was scrubbing at the back of a very strange and awkward recess. ‘Then a very faint image bounced in front of me – I couldn’t believe my eyes. ‘It was a once-in-a life time experience – lots of archaeologists get to study rock art but very few find any.’ Ancient: Experts were studying the discovery at a secret location on the Gower Peninsula, near Swansea . Experts are also studying other marks etched into the rock below the speared reindeer. Dr Nash, associate professor at the University of Tomar in Portugal, said of the artwork: ‘This drawing was done with the right hand by somebody using a piece of flint who has drawn a classic reindeer design. ‘It is very, very exciting.’ Archaelologists have previously dated drawings of red deer at Creswell Crags on the border of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire to around 12,000 to 14,000BC. Dr Nash added: 'I think this newly found carving may be roughly the same period or may be even earlier. 'We know from the glacial geology of the area this was an open area just before the ice limit came down from the glaciers 15,000 to 20,000 years ago and it stops just about 2km short of the cave site. 'We know hunter fisher gatherers were roaming around this landscape.' The cave painting is being verified by experts at the National Museum of Wales and Cadw, the Welsh Ancient Monuments group. Its location will be revealed to the public in the near future.","The faint scratchings of a reindeer with .

Held: Neville Thurlbeck, pictured arriving at the Leveson Inquiry in December, was arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation yesterday . Former News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck today bemoaned the 'swift' action of detectives investigating phone-hacking after he was arrested on suspicion of intimidating a witness. Thurlbeck, 50, was held after criticising executive Will Lewis, who is on News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee, in a blog post. In one entry, the journalist named the security firm protecting Mr Lewis' home and the North London street where he lives. The road name - which can be found on the publicly available electoral roll - was subsequently removed from the post. Lawyers for Mr Lewis threatened an injunction, accusing . Thurlbeck of carrying out surveillance on his home, invading his privacy . and publishing libels about him. His . lawyers also claimed the reporter had libelled News Corporation's . Management and Standards Committee, formed to clean up the company – . which published the now defunct Sunday tabloid – following the hacking . revelations. As a key member of the MSC, Mr Lewis has become a central figure in a civil war in Rupert Murdoch's empire. The committee's co-operation with . Scotland Yard has caused fury among journalists after internal emails . and details of suspected illegal activity were handed to detectives, . which resulted in the arrests of several reporters and senior executives . from The Sun. Thurlbeck was one of the first suspects questioned by detectives from the Yard's hacking probe, Operation Weeting, last April. Yesterday he was arrested by police on suspicion of witness intimidation after turning up for a pre-arranged appointment at a central London police station. Writing after he was bailed, Thurlbeck said the events 'really didn't feel like England'. He also denied any wrong-doing. He wrote: 'Clearly, my blog has upset someone. 'So much so, one minute I was sitting . penning a new post. The next, I was in the police station, having DNA . mouth swabs and my fingerprints and police mugshot taken. 'A complaint had been made and acted upon very swiftly indeed. 'It really didn't feel like England today.' After thanking his lawyer, family and . friends, he went on: 'I vigorously deny the allegations of any . wrongdoing, which seem extremely far-fetched to me. Police probe: Will Lewis is on News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee, formed to clean up the company following the phone hacking scandal . 'And I will continue with my blog and my work regardless of today's events. 'I will be issuing no further statement on this matter in the immediate future.' Blog post: News Corporation Will Lewis was criticised by Thurlbeck who also published his street name . He also stressed Scotland Yard 'got my . age wrong again' in a statement to the press, adding: 'I am a mere 50 years old and not the . prehistoric 51 they insist I am!' Mr Thurlbeck was arrested the day after former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks, her . husband Charlie, and four other suspects were arrested over allegations . of cover-ups surrounding the phone-hacking inquiry. Scotland Yard said Mr Thurlbeck was bailed after being questioned on suspicion of witness intimidation and encouraging or assisting an offence. A spokesman said yesterday that a '51-year-old man' had been detained. He said: 'A 51-year-old man was arrested by appointment at a central London police station at approximately 4pm today by officers from Operation Weeting, the MPS inquiry into the phone hacking of voicemails. 'He was arrested on suspicion of intimidation of a witness (contrary to Section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994) and encouraging or assisting an offence (contrary to Section 46 of the Serious Crime Act 2007).' The spokesman added: 'He is bailed to return to a south-west London police station in May this year in relation to the arrest in April.' Thurlbeck has said detectives asked him to become a prosecution witness after seizing documents from his home. Evidence taken from his property after his first arrest last April indicated that he warned senior colleagues two years ago about hacking, he said. Former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks, pictured with News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, was arrested in connection with the phone-hacking scandal in a dawn raid on her Oxfordshire home . Thurlbeck said detectives hoped he would become a key witness in return for potential immunity from prosecution. But he said he had turned down the offer. He said in November: 'I have informed Scotland Yard that while I fully understand and respect the reason for their request of me to give evidence for the Crown in any prosecution arising from Operation Weeting, it is my opinion that a detailed and forensic inquiry into my working methods by what is a highly professional police unit will fully exonerate me. 'So, on that basis, I have declined their offer.' Thurlbeck has also previously lodged a claim for unfair dismissal against News International.","Neville Thurlbeck named street where News Corporation executive Will Lewis lives in blog posting .

A care home manager posed as the long-lost daughter of an  elderly resident as part of  an attempt  to inherit £300,000 from him, a court heard. Beverley Jeffs, 52, allegedly altered William Mansfield's will to make herself the beneficiary of 40 per cent of his £760,000 estate.

When she was questioned, Jeffs claimed to be William Mansfield's daughter, said prosecutor Justin Wigoder. She even altered her medical records to add Mr Mansfield as her father, and wrote to Terry Mansfield claiming that a DNA test had proved with 99 per cent certainty that she was his late cousin's daughter, said Mr Wigoder.

A former EastEnders actress told a friend she had made three crucial mistakes after battering an elderly widow to death, a court heard. Karen Williamson, 45, described the killing of Jean Jobson to neighbour Donna Coleman and admitted she had made a string of errors, jurors were told. Williamson is alleged to have used a hammer and a glass jug to cave in her 86-year-old victim's skull before fleeing with cash, jewellery and bank cards. The mother-of-one, who featured in a host of TV shows including The Bill and EastEnders as an extra, made her confession around ten days after the killing, the Old Bailey heard. Giving evidence, Ms Coleman said Williamson had made the shock revelation as they chatted in her bedroom, following the accused killer's first interview with police. She told jurors: 'She said, ""Donna, I made three mistakes."" 'The first one is she couldn't find the hat she was wearing. The next one is she couldn't remember if she was wearing her gloves when she got into her car. 'She wasn't sure if she had got blood on her gearstick.' Asked by prosecutor Brian Altman QC what the third mistake had been, Ms Coleman replied: 'She never actually said.' Williamson had been carrying out gardening work for Mrs Jobson at her home in Oakridge Road, Downham, south London, at the time of the killing, the court has heard. Earlier, Ms Campbell said Williamson had told her about a row with the elderly lady over £20 she had loaned her for a strimmer. Recalling what Williamson had told her, Ms Campbell said: 'She (Mrs Jobson) grabbed hold of Karen. 'She grabbed her hat. She was holding on to her, shouting. Karen Williamson, 45, used a hammer and a glass jug in the attack, the Old Bailey heard . 'While they were tussling about the old lady shouted: ""Karen, have you gone mad?"" 'She was holding her, she wouldn't let go and she was quite strong. She was spitting in her face.' Williamson later said to have admitted: 'She was a strong cow, I couldn't get her off me.' Ms Campbell said she had also been told: 'If I'm honest, Donna, she was getting the better of me.' 'She grabbed a hammer in her tool bag and then she started hitting the old lady with it because she couldn't get her off her,' she added. 'She told me she was hitting her in her head. She said she just lost it. 'She said, ""Donna, I was hitting her so hard with the hammer, the hammer broke"".' Williamson finished off her confession by claiming she had tried to start a fire by draping some laundry over a gas fire, the court heard. Ms Campbell said Williamson had also told her she disposed of the hammer in a patch of woodland and burned her clothes in her back garden after returning home. Mrs Jobson, also known as Pat, had no children and had lived alone since her husband died 10 years ago. She had worked as a bus conductress and a secretary for London County Council and had served as an officer in the Territorial Army.

It is a stunning Tudor summer house, set amid the splendour of 'Britain's finest Elizabethan garden'. That's how a planning inspector described this National Trust property – before granting permission  for four huge wind turbines on nearby land. The Trust is furious at the decision, which it says will blight the historic building's setting and spell disaster for other heritage sites. The future: How Lyveden New Bield in Northamptonshire could look when the wind farm is installed, to the horror of the National Trust . Protests: Peter Stephens, chairman of Stop Barnwell Wind Farm Committee - which opposed the development - at Lyveden New Bield . But their fears for Lyvden New Bield . in Northamptonshire were dismissed on the grounds that the Government's . green targets – to produce 15 per cent of energy from renewable sources . by 2020 – must come first. The Planning Inspectorate granted a . company permission to build the 125metre-high turbines just over half a . mile from the property, as well as an access road, mast and underground . cables. It allowed the application on appeal after it was rejected by . East Northamptonshire Council last year. Inspector Paul Griffiths acknowledged that 'irreplaceable' historic assets should receive the highest level of protection. He even conceded that the turbines . would be clearly visible from the estate and surrounding villages and be . an 'alien and incongruous' presence in the historic landscape. Mr Griffiths noted that the garden was . described as 'probably the finest surviving example of an Elizabethan . Garden', and that Lyveden New Bield has a 'cultural value of national, . if not international significance'. Despite this, he concluded: 'The . significant benefits of the proposal in terms of the energy it would . produce from a renewable source outweigh the less than substantial harm . it would cause to the setting.' Change of direction: The four turbines - reduced from five in the original application - would be just a kilometre away and visible from every part of the site (file photo) Dame Fiona Reynolds, director-general . of the National Trust, said: 'This decision is a landmark case which . undermines the protection of our heritage sites. 'It provides a clear indication that . our cultural heritage is at great risk from inappropriately sited wind . turbines and wind farms. If the impacts here are not such to amount to . substantial harm on our nation's heritage, it is difficult to conceive . where they would be. 'The site has the highest heritage designation possible, putting it on a par with places like Hampton Court.' 'Unique': The Government said Lyveden New Bield was arguably the most ambitious and unusual surviving example of an Elizabethan garden in England . UN carbon trade 'is a failure' Barnwell Manor Wind Farm was opposed . by many local residents and by local MP Louise Mensch.  It would be . built on neighbouring land owned by the Queen's cousin the Duke of . Gloucester, by West Coast Energy based in Mold, North Wales. The Duke and Duchess live in an apartment at Kensington Palace and lease out their 2,500-acre estate near Oundle. West Coast Energy said the turbines . would produce ten megawatts, enough to supply the needs of 5,730 homes a . year and 'produce affordable, secure and renewable energy for . generations to come'. The house was begun in the late 1500s . by local sheriff Sir Thomas Tresham, a devout Roman Catholic who imbued . the design with religious significance. It was left unfinished when he . died in 1605. The National Trust discovered the . remains of an Elizabethan pleasure garden in the grounds of the manor . and restored its moats, terraces and apple orchards in the original . style. Onshore wind power sites are highly . controversial and only around 25 per cent of proposals for them are . being approved, according to Renewable UK.

"To be offered to an institution that promises to offer an education based on Christian beliefs . Campus in Massachusetts is ready to be occupied . By . Rachel Rickard Straus . PUBLISHED: . 08:13 EST, 14 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:39 EST, 14 March 2012 . A billionaire family from Oklahoma is offering a 217-acre campus for free to a Christian institution. Worth more than $20million, the campus in Northfield, Massachusetts will be offered to an institution that promises to offer an education founded on traditional Christian beliefs. It must also be able to show it has the funds to maintain the sprawling, classic New England campus. On offer: A view through a window at Kenarden Hall looks out on to the historic campus, which has been offered to a Christian institution . The campus was once home to the Northfield Mount Hermon prep school, founded as a girls’ school by famed evangelist D.L. Moody. It now belongs to the Green family, who own the Oklahoma-based Hobby Lobby craft store chain. They bought in in 2009 for $100,000, with the intention of giving it to a new college named after Christian scholar C.S. Lewis. However that project stalled amid fundraising woes, prompting the Greens to search for another owner. Since the market to resell the campus does not currently exist, Hobby Lobby president Steve Green said the family has decided to offer the campus and its 43 buildings to a select institution that can meet its criteria. Following $5million of renovations, the campus is now ready to be occupied, but it is expensive to keep it in this condition. Mr Green said the family would like to transfer the grounds to a new owner at least by the end of the year. The Greens invited 15 top Christian institutions to view the campus, 11 of which have now visited. Another nine have been allowed to inspect the grounds as news of the offer has spread, and more requests are coming in daily. Some Northfield Mount Hermon alumni are protesting against Liberty's interest in the campus, citing what they call the 'divisive and hateful' views of its founder . So far, Olivet, Azusa Pacific University and Liberty University are among the schools whose names have gone public. There is concern about how a conservative Christian institution will mesh in a town of about 3,000 in a notably liberal state. ‘We hope that whatever's here can bring people together and not divide,’ said Alexander Stewart, chair of a town committee monitoring the sale. Mr Green added that the priority is to find the right tenant, restoring Moody’s original intent to create a place to teach and train people to share Biblical truth. Even while the campus remains vacant, Moody’s legacy lives on, with busloads of Christians from South Korea - where Moody’s ministry had a deep impact - still climbing to join hands and pray around Moody’s hilltop grave. ‘We would love to see the property be used for a great Christian ministry, and if we help somebody to get that started without a lot of heartburn ... and be a light in the area, that would be our primary goal,’ Mr Green said. Liberty's interest has prompted some Northfield Mount Hermon alumni to petition the school's board of trustees to protest any sale to the university, citing what they called the ‘divisive and hateful’ views of its founder, the late Rev. Jerry Falwell. Residents have also met to discuss concerns about Virginia-based Liberty and the fate of the campus.

To make the transaction as simple as possible, the family prefers to give the campus to someone who will take it all, and Liberty has discussed assuming control of only a portion of it. Mr Green added such protests would matter ‘very little’ to the family if it felt it had found a good suitor who would also be a good neighbour. ‘You'll never please everybody and we understand that,’ he said.","To be offered to an institution that promises to offer an education based on Christian beliefs .

When a brazen shoplifter skulked into a post office in Edinburgh, he assumed it would be easy to pocket a couple of drinks. But behind the counter was Arfan Hussain - grocer, sub-postmaster... and former Tae Kwon Do champion. Mr Hussain, who has a second degree black-belt in the Korean combat style, has now become an internet hit after posting CCTV footage of himself wrestling with the thief on YouTube. No nonsense: Shopkeeper and martial arts expert Arfan Hussain tackled a shoplifter in his store in Edinburgh . In the clip the 30-year-old shopkeeper is seen taking down the teen after he tried to leave the shop with two milkshakes worth £2.30. Mr Hussain’s 51-year-old father, Riaz, can also be seen joining the fray in the Costless Express store, which houses Muirhouse Post Office. The shopkeeper has now been hailed the internet’s next ‘Big Man’, with his clip already having gained 1,500 hits since the incident on Monday. The famous ‘Big Man’ YouTube hit, which racked up two million views, sparked massive debate after banker Allan Pollock was seen throwing Sam Main off a train, taking matters into his own hands after the student allegedly refused to pay his fare. Mr Hussain said he hoped his film would prove a deterrent to shoplifters visiting the store. Paid the price: The shoplifter hides under the hood of his green jacket as he swipes two milkshakes from the shelf . The shopkeeper and his family have been in business for 21 years and he claims the thief had been barred after he was spotted stealing ‘three or four times’. Mr Hussain added: ‘He came back and stole two more shakes. I approached him as he went for the door and he took a swing at me. ‘I’m a second degree black-belt in Tae Kwon Do, so I know how to control that kind of situation and do it without hurting someone. I grabbed him and threw him down.’ In January last year, Mr Hussain was held up at gunpoint by 18-year-old Craig Vallance, who threatened ‘I’ll blow your brains out’. The gun was later revealed to be replica rifle and Vallance was jailed for five years and four months. Mr Hussain has been more cautious since the ordeal, and so when the shoplifter struck on Saturday, he was ready to stamp out any potential threat. He said: ‘He was shouting and swearing and then he started going for his pockets. I didn’t know if he was going to pull a needle or a knife and, after what happened last year, I didn’t want to take a chance.’ Hold it: Mr Hussain intercepts the thief as he makes for the door . Taken down: After a brief scuffle Mr Hussain, dressed in black, seizes the shoplifter by the lapel and hurls him to the floor . Mr Hussain said he deals with around three shoplifters a week, most of whom surrender without incident. He added: ‘The police said I should’ve let him leave the store first, but Scots law is on my side as he went past the counter and touched the door. ‘It was my friend who suggested I put the CCTV on YouTube, but I had no idea it would get so many hits.’ However, one rival shopkeeper, who asked not to be named, criticised Mr Hussain, saying: ‘This was clearly unreasonable force. It was totally disgusting and unacceptable. The shopkeeper should be charged with assault.’ A Lothian and Borders Police spokeswoman said: ‘A 17-year-old boy has been charged in connection with this incident and is due to appear at court at a later date.’","The teenage thief tried to run off with two milkshakes worth just £2.30 .

Josh Wakeham, aged just 22 months, was killed in a freak accident when the cord from his bedroom window blind became wrapped around his neck . A coroner today warned parents of the dangers of ordinary hazards in the home after a tragic toddler was strangled by the cord on a window blind in his bedroom. Little Joshua Wakeham, who would have had his second birthday tomorrow, died in the freak accident on January 24, this year, as he looked out of the window. He was found dead by his mother with the blind cord wrapped around his neck when she went to check on him. The inquest heard ‘active and inquisitive’ Josh was the third child in Britain this year to die after becoming entangled in a roller blind cord. Coroner David Bowen said: ‘It is not reasonable for any parent to monitor their children 24 hours a day, but I hope this tragedy will serve as a warning to all parents. ‘Potential hazards should be put out of reach of children.’ The inquest heard little Josh, then aged 22 months, loved to stand on his bed to wave at passers-by out of his bedroom on the top-floor of his family’s three-storey home. His mother Tracey Ford, 34, said: ‘There was a blackout blind on the window which was there when we moved in. 'He loved to wave to people and I never saw him play with the string on the blind. ‘I put him to bed that night with his toys and turned on the nightlight to let him settle.’ Tracey, who was described a very caring mother, went to check shortly after 9pm - but immediately realised something was wrong. She said: ‘I could see he was stood up and it looked like he was looking out of the window. I then saw that the cord was around his neck. When I touched him he felt cold. Warning: Josh's mother Tracey Ford with her partner and Josh's stepfather Tim Llewellin are warning other parents of the dangers of looped cords on window blinds . ‘I dialled 999 and they gave me instructions to give him mouth-to-mouth. I tried, I really tried. But he was cold.’ Det Sgt Wendy Keeping told the inquest: ‘This is the third death this year in the UK involving young children with roller blinds. Joshua was nearly two and he would not have known of the dangers at all. ‘He became trapped in it and was not old enough to recognise the danger.’ The family’s MP Paul Flynn has . made an early day motion in the House of Commons to call on the blind . manufacturers to bring in safety features. He is also calling for a Government . initiative to publicise the serious danger to the lives of children . from the 250million cords in British homes. Mr Flynn said: ‘The case is heart breaking. The industry should bring out safer cords. ‘There’s new regulations coming in from Europe within a year but there will still be a problem with existing cords. ‘We are asking the government to start a campaign to make sure everyone knows of the dangers.' A post mortem examination found that the youngster had died as a result of strangulation from the cord. Josh’s parents Tracey and Tim have moved out of the house in Newport, South Wales, since the tragedy. Gwent coroner Mr Bowen recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: ‘Joshua was normal, active, healthy, inquisitive child who liked nothing better than standing at his bedroom window waving at members of the public as they walked past. ‘He would stand in the window whether it was day or night. He became entangled in the cord and would not have recognised the danger - he was much too young to release himself.’ He concluded: ‘I am satisfied that while standing at the window Joshua somehow became entangled. ‘He would never have recognised the danger that the cord posed. 'He would have been much too young and would also have been much too weak to release himself. ‘The verdict in this tragic case, therefore, is accidental death.’ The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents are campaigning to raise awareness. Spokesman Michael Corley said: ‘There have been 22 deaths caused by blind cords since 1999. ‘Eleven of these have happened since the beginning of 2010. This is far too high. We are calling for laws to reduce the risks of looped cords by placing safety devices in them or by getting rid of them altogether.’ In October, 2011, the parents of Emily Warner told how their family had been left 'broken' by her death . In October, 2010, 18-month-old Rithik Chakrabarti died in his bedroom in Dorset. And in 2009 Gethin Jones, 23 months, was found strangled at his home in Nefyn, North Wales. In October, 2011, the parents of Emily Warner told how their family had been left 'broken' by her death. The little girl had been put to bed but stood up on the end of her bed-frame and was climbing across her window sill when the accident happened last August. The two-year-old was left paralysed and suffered brain damage, and died months later. Caden Laine, who was 21 months old, died after apparently being strangled by a looped cord from his bedroom window at the family home in Plymouth, Devon. His devastated parents, Tony and Danielle Laine, said that the tragic accident had taken the life of their 'little angel' and warned other parents to check their children's bedrooms in a bid to prevent similar deaths. Caden had an identical twin, Finley, and two-year-old brother Blake. Harrison Joyce, three, from Staffordshire, also died after becoming tangled in a cord in February 2010 . Mrs Laine told how she left the twins' bedroom for just minutes to make some milk, before she returned and found her son hanged on the cord of the vertical blinds. They believe Caden climbed on to a chest of drawers near the window before the tragic event around 7.15pm, in April, last year. Harrison Joyce, three, and Lillian Bagnall-Lambe, 16 months, both from Staffordshire, died in separate incidents within the space of five days after becoming tangled in the cords in February, 2010. Harrison was believed to have been acting out action moves from cartoon series 'Go Diego' when he became tangled in the cord and was killed. He had been left alone for a matter of minutes. Blinds with looped cords are already banned in other countries, including America, Canada and Australia, but millions of people in Britain have them fitted in their homes. Andrew Haigh, coroner for South Staffordshire, recorded accidental death verdicts in respect of the two children's deaths. But he urged the Government to look again at existing safety regulations and said he would be writing to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to highlight the problem. Leah Edwards was sleeping beside her 17-month-old brother at the family home in Maldon, Essex, when the tragedy happened in October 2010. She became entangled in a blind cord. The youngster was discovered by her seven-year-old brother, Christian.","Mother Tracey Wakeham found Joshua, 22 months, hanging with roller blind cord around his neck .

The BBC has been the victim of a 'sophisticated cyber-attack' in an attempt to undermine its Persian Service which broadcasts to Iran, according to director-general Mark Thompson. The BBC boss is expected to discuss what he described as the Iranian government’s attempt to 'undermine' the service during a speech to the Royal Television Society tonight. He will say opponents of the service 'may be widening their tactics' by engaging in cyber-attacks. Mr Thompson will say: 'There was a day recently when there was a simultaneous attempt to jam two different satellite feeds of BBC Persian into Iran, to disrupt the service’s London phone lines by the use of multiple automatic calls, and a sophisticated cyber-attack on the BBC. 'It is difficult, and may prove impossible, to confirm the source of these attacks, though attempted jamming of BBC services into Iran is nothing new and we regard the coincidence of these different attacks as self-evidently suspicious.' The BBC has already said Iranian-based members of staff working for the London-based service have faced intimidation. Mr Thompson will say: 'Arrest without charge, solitary confinement, threats and inducements to persuade their relations either to leave the service or to inform on it secretly to Iranian intelligence: this is how the Iranian government is trying to undermine the BBC Persian Service.' Mr Thompson will go on to say that the BBC 'believe that there is no substitute for eye-witness journalism carried out by professionals on the ground' despite 'multiple threats' to freedom of speech.

An MP’s stepson was found guilty yesterday of the murder of a colleague whose body has never been found. David Gilroy killed Suzanne Pilley in the basement of their workplace after she told him their affair was over. The married father of two is thought to have buried her body in a forest but police have not been able to find the precise location. Guilty! David Gilroy, 49, (left) was convicted of killing Suzanne Pilley, 38, (right) by 'unknown means' after prosecutors convinced a jury he had buried the book-keeper's body in a 'lonely grave' in the Scottish wilds . His father Bernard’s second marriage was to Linda Gilroy, Labour MP for Plymouth and Sutton from 1997 to 2010. The 49-year-old became the prime . suspect when officers learned of his relationship  with 38-year-old Miss . Pilley. Her mother told the court of their turbulent relationship and . how her daughter soon tired of his lies and jealous behaviour. Adventurer: Miss Pilley was described as a proud Scot who led a full and active life, and enjoyed the great outdoors, always walking, cycling and keeping fit . Routine day: She boarded the buses she normally took from her Whitson Road flat to her work at Infrastructure Managers Limited in Edinburgh's Thistle Street, where she had worked for about two years . The day before Miss Pilley vanished, . she spent the night with a man she had met online, 41-year-old planning . officer Mark Brooks. Police believe this caused Gilroy, an operations . manager, to snap. They discovered that in the weeks . leading up to her disappearance, Gilroy pestered Miss Pilley with more . than 400 text messages. Missing: Prosecutors said he killed Ms Pilley on the day she vanished in the basement of the Thistle Street building where they both worked . Sinister: Prosecutors said he placed her body in the recess of the building, got his car from home, brought it to the garage, placed her dead body in the boot, took her home and next day . Search: Gilroy¿s Vauxhall Vectra was spotted on CCTV travelling between Edinburgh and Lochgilphead, Argyll, the day after Ms Pilley disappeared . Mystery: A massive search for Ms Pilley's body was undertaken in the Argyle Forest Park north of Arrochar, west Scotland but no body was found . Challenge: He disappearance sparked a high-profile missing person inquiry and one of the most challenging investigations carried out by Lothian and Borders Police . As soon as the bookkeeper went missing, those . messages stopped. He had also tampered with her email account and sent her emails in another man’s name from a bogus account. Miss Pilley’s parents, Sylvia  and . Rob, both 67, were in  Edinburgh’s High Court to see  Gilroy, of . Edinburgh, convicted of murder and a second charge of attempting to . defeat the ends of justice by frustrating the police investigation. They say they are unable to grieve properly because their daughter’s body has not been found. The case is one of just a handful in which a murderer has been convicted in the absence of a body. Suspicion: Gilroy had scratches on his body around the time Ms Pilley vanished, which could have been caused by fingernails during a struggle, the court was told . Loved: Suzanne Pilley was described by colleagues as 'a much-loved friend and colleague . Miss Pilley vanished on May 4, 2010, . during what should have been a routine journey to work at Infrastructure . Managers Limited in Edinburgh. Police found her passport when they visited her home. None of her bank accounts or credit cards have been touched. Prosecutor Alex Prentice said: ‘The . Crown case is that Suzanne Pilley met David Gilroy on that morning; that . they went to the basement in the building together, quite possibly with . the consent of both, and that he killed her. ‘He got his car from home, brought it . to the garage, placed her dead body in the boot, took her home  and next . day transported her to a lonely grave somewhere in Argyll, where she is . now.’ Although no forensic evidence was . recovered, a police dog showed interest in the boot of Gilroy’s Vauxhall . Vectra, which was said to have had a smell of cleaning fluid or air . freshener. He had scratches on his body around . the time Miss Pilley vanished and his car was spotted on CCTV travelling . to Lochgilphead, Argyll, the day after she disappeared. Outside court, Gilroy’s wife Andrea, who is a nurse, vowed to stand by him, insisting he was innocent. Sentencing was adjourned until April 18 for reports. Clues: A police dog searching his home showed interest in the boot of Gilroy¿s silver car, which was said to have had a smell of cleaning fluid or air freshener .

Noel Edmonds's hit tea-time TV show Deal or No Deal may be forced to air after the 9pm watershed amid claims it constitutes gambling. The Gambling Commission is expected to warn Channel 4 that the programme could be breaking the law because it does not involve an element of skill. Non-skill games played for profit require a gambling licence. ITV's Red Or Black?, presented by Ant and Dec and developed by Simon Cowell, is also said to be under investigation. Producers of Noel Edmonds' hugely successful Deal Or No Deal on Channel 4 have been shocked to be told by the Gambling Commission that their £250,000 jackpot games could be breaking the law . The shows could be subjected to tight . restrictions on the type of advertising broadcast during breaks and the . amount of pre-broadcast publicity. They could even be forced to obtain a licence costing £60,000, and £30,000 to renew every year. Meanwhile ITV plans to revive Bruce . Forsyth’s perennial hit Play Your Cards Right have also been put on ice pending . the outcome of the probe. It is against the law to run non-skill games for . money without a gambling licence – raising the extraordinary prospect of . producers being jailed if they defy the warning. ITV plans to revive Bruce Forsyth's perennial hit Play Your Cards Right have also been put on ice pending the outcome of the probe . Channel 4 . may then decide it would be simpler to cancel Deal Or No Deal, than be constrained by so . many restrictions. The programme, which has been presented by Edmonds since it . was first broadcast in 2005, regularly attracts an audience of more than four . million in its afternoon slot. Viewers watch as contestants guess which of 22 . identical sealed boxes contains the show’s elusive jackpot in what programme . makers Endemol say is a contest of ‘instinct, gut feeling and luck’. As boxes . are opened, contestants decide whether to accept a cash offer from the . mysterious Banker, or play on in the hope of increasing the offer, while . running the risk of receiving a much lower prize. However, a Government source . told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The Gambling Commission does not seem to think that . there is any skill element to the show. ‘Even though at the beginning of the . show, contestants do not have to stake any of their own money, the argument is . that once they’ve picked a box, which could contain a lot of cash, in . subsequent rounds they are in effect gambling with their own money,’ Separately, the Commission is also understood to have raised issues over Red Or . Black?, where contestants win £1 million on the spin of a wheel. The Commission . has told the programme makers that the participants need to show more skill in . winning the top prize to escape the need for a gaming licence – which would . mean the end of the crucial roulette wheel. Regulators are also said to be . concerned about the way the show ‘glamorises’ gambling. ITV's Red Or Black?, the £1 million a-night game show presented by Ant and Dec, and developed by Simon Cowell, is also understood to have been hit by the investigation . ITV's Red Or Black? was developed by Simon Cowell . The Mail on Sunday also . understands that ITV is shelving plans to bring back the popular Eighties quiz . show Play Your Cards Right, in which prizes are determined on the turn of a . card, for the same reason. Last night the move was met with bewilderment among . game show bosses, who argue that rules created to control casinos and illegal . betting should not be applied to entertainment programmes. One senior . broadcasting source, who has been fighting the probe behind the scenes, said: . ‘This is an absolutely ridiculous state of affairs. ‘The Gambling Commission . has no right to be poking its nose into what are harmless television . programmes. 'How can anyone regard Deal Or No Deal as gambling? 'It is probably . the most innocent show on television. I think its very telling that this . programme is aired in 30 different countries but only in Britain has this . become an issue. ‘You also have to look it from the point of broadcaster. They . are already heavily regulated by Ofcom. Why on earth would they want to also . come under the control of the Gambling Commission as well? 'Surely Noel Edmonds isn't that frightening' 'That means they . would be answerable to two different regulators who would be looking into its . affairs. The people who make Deal Or No Deal want to operate as a television . production company not a casino.’ Simon Cowell’s spokesman, Max Clifford, said: . ‘Simon wants to come up with the most exciting combination he can which remains . within the rules. His view is that it is a light entertainment programme with a . gambling element – not what the Commission is claiming.’ As well as . restrictions on scheduling, advertising and trailers, any TV company whose . shows fell under gambling rules would also need to prove to the Commission that . its executives had an understanding of the complex laws and regulations . surrounding the betting industry. This could force them to team up with a . gambling company in order to employ the relevant expertise. The expert said: . ‘The gambling industry is the most stringently regulated industry in the UK . because of the capacity for high level organised crime. ‘The Gambling . Commission wants to make sure these shows are not enticing people to go out and . gamble recklessly, and some programmes may fall into this category in their . current format. Red Or Black? was launched in a blaze of publicity by ITV and Simon Cowell’s SycoTV production company last September. With a £15million budget it was the most expensive game show ever devised – and producers assumed it would be a ratings smash. However, it struggled to find an audience and, five months on there are doubts whether the show will ever return to the screen. Producers are understood to be locked in talks with the Gambling Commission about whether the show can return in its existing format or whether it needs to be revamped. One suggestion is that the show’s roulette wheel, which decides whether contestants leave as millionaires, may not return. The row over gambling is the latest controversy to hit the show, which was devised by Cowell personally. Last year, it emerged that Nathan Hageman, the winner of the show’s first £1 million prize, had a conviction for assaulting a woman, sparking demands for the prize to be withdrawn. Three other contestants were subsequently pulled out of show and at least one of these had a criminal record. Cowell had hope the show would replicate the success of his other programmes including Britain’s Got Talent and the X Factor. Its opening night audience of almost seven million was respectable, but did not come close to the ten million which had been predicted. Subsequent episodes would attract less than four million viewers. The show also controversially provided a showcase for some of Cowell’s music acts, including X Factor winner Leona Lewis. ITV has still yet to announce a second series but the broadcaster and Syco are in talks. Last night, ITV insisted that its return had not been delayed by the Gambling Commission. A spokesman said: ‘A decision will be made on a second series of Red Or Black? in due course.’ ‘If a TV company was unwilling to change the format then they . could be forced into a range of moves which would effectively kill off the show . altogether. ‘The problem is this is an extremely complex area that is in danger . of encroaching on harmless family entertainment. It will undoubtedly be a case . of compromise for the shows in question, but if the Commission aren’t careful, . we could see the end of several popular family game shows.’ A spokesman for the . Gambling Commission refused to comment, saying it never talks about . ‘individual’ cases. However, he confirmed that the Commission was about to . publish new guidance for television game shows. He said: ‘In the first . instance, we would contact the operator to discuss the situation, as compliance . is always preferable over enforcement action.’ The Commission, which was set up . as the independent regulator under the Gambling Act 2005, is required to . keeping crime out of gambling, ensure gambling is conducted fairly and openly . and protect children and vulnerable people from being harmed or exploited by . gambling. The spokesman declined to say how much a television company would . have to pay for a gambling operating licence. However, based on a formula . linked to company turnover and published on the Commission’s website, a permit . would probably cost about £60,000 to apply for, with annual renewals costing . about £30,000. Dr Mark Griffiths, professor of gambling studies at Nottingham . Trent University, said that, in his opinion, Deal Or No Deal, did involve . gambling. He said: ‘The bottom line is, contestants in the show are effectively . gambling. The show producers will say that the people on it are not putting up . any of their own money. But once they are on it, they have been given money and . it’s their money they are gambling on.’ Dr Griffiths said that a TV show that . had to operate with a gaming licence should be moved to a later slot in the . television schedules. ‘Gambling is an adult activity so it should go out after . the 9pm watershed in my view.’ Dr Griffiths added that he had been urging the . Gambling Commission to look into television game shows for some time, saying: . ‘For some years, there’s been a blurring between gambling and gaming. I am very . pleased they’re looking into this.’ Last night, a Channel 4 spokesman said: . ‘Channel 4 has been contacted by the Gambling Commission about the popular long . running series Deal Or No Deal. It would not be appropriate to comment further . at this time.’ A source at the channel added: ‘People are very worried. The . producers don’t want to be tarred with the gambling brush’.

Families of Hillsborough victims reacted with outrage yesterday after it was revealed Merseyside Police told Margaret Thatcher the disaster was caused by drunken Liverpool fans. Leaked documents show how senior officers blamed disorderly supporters just days after the 1989 stadium tragedy which left 96 dead. At least one Liverpool-based policeman said he was ‘ashamed’ of the spectators’ behaviour. Former chief constable: Sir Kenneth Oxford with his wife Muriel after receiving a CBE . The briefings contrast with the findings of the official inquiry, which pinned the blame on officers responsible for crowd control at the FA Cup semi-final at Sheffield Wednesday’s ground. Supporters’ groups have been pushing for all documents surrounding the tragedy to be published, claiming there was an attempt to cover up police failings and discredit fans. Yesterday it emerged that four days after the disaster, a member of then-prime minister Mrs Thatcher’s policy unit met Merseyside officers for their views on the cause. According to the document, leaked to the BBC, chief constable Sir Kenneth Oxford told the adviser: ‘A key factor in causing the disaster was the fact that large numbers of Liverpool fans had turned up without tickets. ‘This was getting lost sight of in attempts to blame the police, the football authorities, etc.’ Another – unnamed – officer was said to have directly blamed the supporters. ‘One officer, born and bred in Liverpool, said that he was deeply ashamed to say that it was drunken Liverpool fans who had caused this disaster, just as they had caused the deaths at Heysel,’ the note said. The document is initialled ‘MT’, suggesting it was read by Mrs Thatcher, and the phrase ‘drunken Liverpool fans’ is underlined by hand. Tragedy: Ninety-six people died at the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 . Thirty-nine died at the Heysel stadium in Belgium in 1985 when Liverpool supporters charged Juventus fans. Although the inquest into the Hillsborough deaths was told that vast quantities of alcohol had been consumed before kick-off, the official Taylor Report blamed the tragedy on blunders by South Yorkshire officers policing the match. It said opening an exit gate just before kick-off enabled hundreds of fans to pour into a full ‘pen’ on the terraces, causing the fatal crush. The Hillsborough Independent Panel, set up in 2009, is reviewing all official papers relating to the disaster with a view to their release later this year. Blame: Another policeman also said Liverpool fans were responsible for the deaths, according to the document . Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said last night: ‘We are obviously disgusted with the views of Merseyside Police but to some of us that will come as no surprise.’ And Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James died in the stadium, said the note confirmed her fears of an attempted cover-up. ‘The thing I’m most upset about is the way they are accusing the fans,’ she said. ‘They watched videos of what happened . that day and they (have seen) survivors running along with bodies and . maybe people who may be still alive on hoardings. They were the heroes . that day. Disapproving: Sir Kenneth was concerned about Anfield being turned into a 'shrine', according to the papers . ‘I find all of that absolutely appalling. Ninety-six lives and he was uneasy about it made into a shrine. ‘The . people who were there that day - the survivors, the fans - all needed . somewhere to go to show respect and to be grateful that no more had . died. He was ashamed that was made into a shrine. How appalling is . that?’ Labour MP Andy Burnham, who has backed efforts to secure the documents’ release, said: ‘These papers seem to confirm what we’ve believed for many, many years – that immediate attempts were made from the highest levels to shift the blame on to the supporters and away from the police.’ Margaret Thatcher was told about the views of Merseyside Police four days after the tragedy . A controversial figure, Sir Kenneth – who died in 1998 – was frequently at loggerheads with the city’s Labour-dominated police authority. Last night former assistant chief constable Alison Halford, who was in charge of the force’s initial response to the disaster, said she was shocked by his views. ‘There was no suggestion at the time that fans were drunk,’ she said. ‘Sir Kenneth never spoke to me about what had happened and I find his comments absolutely appalling.’ Merseyside Chief Constable Jon Murphy said it would be inappropriate to comment. Sheila Coleman of the Hillsborough . Justice Campaign said she was disgusted but not surprised at the views . expressed by the police. ‘Those . of us who were around Liverpool in the 1980s are well aware of Ken . Oxford’s racist and bigoted views, Presumably he recruited senior . officers with a similar mindset,’ she told the programme. ‘We are obviously disgusted with the views of Merseyside Police but to some of us that will come as no surprise.’ She also expressed concern at the timing of the leak and the fact that none of the papers related to the South Yorkshire force. ‘That . makes us very suspicious of how this information was leaked,’ she said. ‘Merseyside Police would have been informed by South Yorkshire Police. ‘We . find it a strange coincidence that this information is leaked only days . after we found out the panel are not going to report until the autumn.’","Leaked Government papers show Margaret Thatcher was told of claims in meeting .

Suing: Michael Brodkorb is filing a wrongful termination suit because he argues that women who have had affairs in the Minnesota state senate have not been fired but he was . A man who was fired after having an affair with his married Republican superior is now threatening to expose other affairs within the Minnesota State Senate. Michael Brodkorb, the former communications director of the State Senate's Republican leader Amy Koch, was fired the day after Mrs Koch resigned amid allegations that the two had an affair. Though he was fired back in December, he is now suing for wrongful dismissal because he feels that he was only fired because he is a man who had an interoffice affair. He has threatened to depose a number of his female colleagues who have had similar affairs but were able to keep their jobs. 'Mr. Brodkorb has evidence that similarly situated female legislative employees, from both political parties, were not terminated from their employment positions despite intimate relationships with male legislators,' the legal document asserts. 'It is clear that Mr. Brodkorb was terminated based on his gender. 'He intends to depose all of the female legislative staff employees who participated in intimate relationships, as well as the legislators who were party to those intimate relationships, in support of his claims of gender discrimination.' When Mrs Koch resigned over the holidays, she did not reveal the name of her lover. Resigned: Amy Koch, center, resigned in December from her position as Republican leader of the Minnesota State Senate . Staying quiet: Though her reported lover has been very public about the affair Mrs Koch still refuses to identify her lover . But given that she and Mr Brodkorb were . extremely close- and that he was fired by Republican higher-ups the next . day, the local press was quick to make the connection. 'I made errors in judgement, for which I am deeply sorry, by engaging in a relationship with a Senate staffer,' she said at the time. She was certain to point out that the affair was not against the law nor did she abuse her power and had not 'misused any state funds or property'. Though Mr Brodkorb's lawyer insists that his client is not simply threatening to air his colleague's dirty laundry for fun, but out of necessity. Lawyer Phil Vallaume told The Minnesota Star Tribune that the depositions with the alleged infidels would take place in private to protect their identities. Mrs Koch has remained tight-lipped about the issue, and has yet to publicly confirmed whether or not Mr Brodkorb was the man in question, though his actions seem to have done the work for her.","Michael Brodkorb, who was fired for having an affair with his boss, is now suing saying that his female coworkers who have affairs are not fired .

Fuel prices rose again yesterday as the first petrol delivery trucks rolled out of the Coryton oil refinery since its parent company went bust. Diesel edged ever closer to a new record high that retailers predict will be hit by the end of the month amid concerns that crude oil deliveries to the refinery are being held in limbo. On average across the UK, diesel increased to 142.41p a litre, to within a fraction of a penny of a new record, from 142.32p, the AA reported. Petrol rose to 134.13p a litre, up from 134.03p on Wednesday. Queues: Motorists at a petrol station in Colchester, one of hundreds that saw extra demand after the firm behind one of Britain's biggest oil refineries went bust . Record fuel prices were set in May last year when diesel hit 143.04p and petrol 137.43p. Petrol retailers predict diesel . prices in particular are set to soar by up to 3p to a new record £1.45 a . litre. That would see a £100 fill-up for ‘Mondeo Man’ in his - or her - . family saloon with a 70-litre tank. Brian Madderson, chairman of the . forecourt retailers’ group RMI Petrol, welcomed the resumption of . supplies from Coryton, but warned: ‘Although it is hoped that supplies . will not be affected in the short term, we are already seeing an adverse . impact on wholesale fuel prices. ‘There is pressure on wholesale . prices due to the developing EU embargo on Iranian crude oil shipments . which was confirmed at a meeting of EU officials only last Monday. The . Coryton setback now just adds further pressure to an already difficult . market.’ He added: ‘Wholesale prices for . diesel have risen by 0.8ppl and petrol by 1.2ppl since last weekend and . with 20 per cent VAT added, average UK prices at the pump are also rising. We . are could see diesel over the 143.04p per litre record high of May 2011 . by the end of January.' Mr Madderson suggested Coryton and other refineries may still be vulnerable. He said: ‘It is good news that road . tankers on the move again from the refinery. However, this may only . provide a short term solution. The Coryton refinery currently holds a . limited amount of crude oil on site and urgently needs new stocks.’ Panic over? The first fuel tanker leaves Coryton since news emerged of the refinery's parent company going into receivership . He added: ‘This is wake up call for . the UK’s energy resilience and we will be looking to Government to take . the lead. How financially secure is the former Shell refinery at Stanlow . in Cheshire? The new owner, Essar, has seen its share price collapse on . the London stock market from 550p to 127p.’ He said the Coryton refinery currently holds a limited amount of crude oil on site and urgently needs new stocks. A Chinese tanker was due to discharge at Coryton No 4 berth on Saturday but has been held at anchorage in the Thames Estuary. Mr Madderson said: ’It is believed . that this stalemate will continue until the cargo owners find a . financial guarantor for this very costly shipment.’ A second tanker due to discharge at Coryton No. 5 berth next Tuesday is also at anchor awaiting financial guarantors, he said. Queues of motorists yesterday . continued to line up at the pumps, raising fears of fuel panic-buying - . despite the fact that petrol delivery trucks were rolling from the . gates of Coryton oil refinery. However, . it may be too late to stop fuel price rises sparked by the shut-down . and already in the pipeline from hitting forecourts. Coryton refinery in Essex , one of the main oil refineries to London and the South East has been closed by its Swiss owner, raising the prospect of fuel shortages on the capital's forecourts . Petrol . retailers and motoring groups believe prices will be driven up by . speculators taking advantage of the three days of disruption on the . wholesale fuel markets. There was queuing at some forecourts as the shutdown led to fears of fuel shortages and price hikes. The Essex refinery's administrators . PriceWaterhouseCooper blamed the three-day hold up of deliveries on a . legal and contractual wrangle over supplies. Payment for Corytons fuel have . traditionally been made through the refinery’s Swiss parent company . Petroplus which went bust on Tuesday. Receivers say they have spent the . time since then trying to ‘unscramble the system’ and put new contracts . in place with customers, including hundreds of BP and Texaco forecourts. Yesterday . the receivers said that after discussions with suppliers and customers . they had started shipments of refined oil products with immediate . effect, easing fears over fuel shortages. The . site, which supplies 20 per cent of fuel in London and the South East, . halted sales after its Swiss owner Petroplus placed the refinery into . administration, prompting fears of up to 1,000 job losses.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 06:37 EST, 18 January 2012 . A cruise company has said it was surprised and disappointed after one of its vessels was turned away by the Falkland Islands government. The Star Princess ship, owned by Princess Cruises, had planned to dock in Port Stanley on a cruise from Chile to Brazil, with several stops in Argentina. Falklands government spokesman Darren Christie said they had to deny the vessel entry because several of the passengers had stomach flu and the islands were ill-equipped to handle a contagious virus. Shut out: The Star Princess cruise liner, which holds 3,500 passengers - many of them Argentine - was turned away from Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands because many onboard had a stomach bug . Dispute: The cruise liner was barred from docking at Port Stanley, where the authorities said the island could not cope with an outbreak of illness . But there will be suspicions that the decision was a political one as Argentina and Britain continue to engage in a diplomatic row over the island the South American country calls Las Malvinas. Many Argentines were among the 3,500 passengers and crew onboard the cruise liner as it was forced to continue on to Argentina. Princess Cruises said the decision was unwarranted and unscientific and runs against international health policy. It comes one month after members of the Mercosur trading bloc, which includes Argentina, announced it would bar military vessels flying the Falkland Islands emblem from docking in ports. Uruguayan president Jose Mujica announced the decision, which covers ports in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, but then claimed it was motivated by economic factors. Territory: Horses in the wild on the remote Falkland Islands. Argentina has reignited its claims to the islands after oil exploration began last year . Conflict: The Liberation Monument in Port Stanley. More than 900 people were killed after Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982 . Tensions between Argentina and Britain have been raised after months of posturing over the Atlantic Ocean islands. The South American country intensified its campaign of intimidation against fishing boats operating with UK licences and last month, Spanish vessels bound for the islands were intercepted and boarded by troops. Earlier this month it told its . fishermen to catch Illex squid, a rare delicacy in the Far East, before . they reach the waters around the British territory. The . move was designed to deal a damaging blow to the islands' booming . £90million economy - half of which relies on its fishing industry. The row reared its head again in January last year when oil exploration rigs arrived off the islands. Argentina has always claimed the islands should belong to it, despite the fact they were claimed by Britain in the 1830s - before modern Argentina was technically founded. Rockhopper Exploration, which carried out test drilling in the waters around the islands, said in September it had made significant finds and could begin pumping by 2016. Britain has around 1,200 service personnel on the islands, and there are three Royal Navy warships in the area along with four RAF Typhoon fighter bombers. In 1982, Argentina's junta invaded the islands. Then prime minister Margaret Thatcher sent a task force including aircraft carriers equipped with Harrier jump jets and an invasion force to retake the territory. A 74-day war claimed the lives of 649 Argentines and 255 Britons as the Falklands were successfully defended. Concerns have been raised, however, that defence cuts last year could leave the territory vulnerable to another attack by Argentina.","Star Princess was due to stop in Port Stanley during cruise between Chile, Argentina and Brazil .

Argentina has launched another salvo in its war of words over the Falkland Islands by threatening businesses who join the search for oil in the South Atlantic. The country’s foreign minister Hector Timerman said it would pursue legal action against firms exploring around the islands - and any other companies who do business with them. The British Government hit back, accusing Argentina’ of ‘illegal intimidation’. And Prime Minister David Cameron insisted Britain would continue to ‘stick up’ for Falklanders’ rights. Scroll down for video . Warning: Foreign Minister Hector Timerman (left), pictured with Treasury solicitor Angelina Abbona in Buenos Aires yesterday, said Argentina will take legal action against any company involved in oil exploration off the Falklands . Mr Timerman said there would be ‘administrative, civil and criminal’ penalties against any companies involved. ‘We will not let a single day go by . without filing some action in a court, administrative seat or . international tribunal enabling us to protect the reserves which belong . to the people and to the Argentine Republic,’ he said. ‘The gas and oil that is found in the South Atlantic belongs to the Argentinian people. ‘All these companies are entering illegal territory.’ He has assembled a team of lawyers and officials to chase companies through the courts wherever they do business. As well as oil explorers, it will target firms which supply them, as well as banks and financial companies. Contested: A depot for oil exploration machinery and equipment in Port Stanley . Buenos Aires has ramped up its rhetoric over the Islands in the run up to April 2, the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War. It has already closed Argentine . shipping lanes to companies searching for oil. Experts think billions of . pounds worth of oil may be buried under the sea bed around the . Falklands. Mr Timmerman said companies involved . in oil exploration in Falklands waters were ‘violating UN resolutions’ calling for talks on sovereignty. The Foreign Office said the search for oil was a legitimate commercial venture. A spokesman said: ‘These latest . attempts to damage the economic livelihoods of the Falkland Islands . people regrettably reflect a pattern of behaviour by the Argentine . government. ‘We are studying Argentina’s remarks . carefully and will work closely with any company potentially affected to . ensure that the practical implications for them are as few as possible. Drilling platform: The Ocean Guardian oil rig moved from Scotland to its current home off the Falklands two years ago . ‘From harassing Falklands shipping to . threatening the islanders’ air links with Chile, Argentina’s efforts to . intimidate the Falklands are illegal, unbecoming and wholly . counter-productive.' On 2 April 1982, Argentina invaded the Falklands, only to be defeated by a British task force sent to recover them. The UK says there will be no negotiations on sovereignty as long as the Falkland islanders wish to remain British. Speaking in the U.S. following talks . with President Obama, Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘The people of . the Falkland Islands could not be clearer that they want to continue . their status as an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. ‘As long as they want that, that is not going to change. ‘To me it is very important that we . stick up for the right of self-determination.

Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte . Thompson, 13, were hit by a train in 2005 as they crossed the tracks at . Elsenham station footpath crossing in Essex. Judge David Turner QC, sentencing at Chelmsford Crown Court, ordered Network Rail to pay the large fine and £60,000 costs. He said: 'I have concluded that there . was a clear history of inadequate risk assessment and a failure to heed . and act upon relevant information. 'There was a consistent failure to . take timely remedial action - a consistent underplaying that this . crossing was being regularly misused. 'Warnings went unheeded, data insufficiently appraised and critical questions went unasked and unanswered. 'Remedial action was unsatisfactorily delayed.' He added: 'Narrow thinking, culpable . corporate blindness and a complacency going beyond merely inefficient . incompetency to entering the realm of criminal failure.' Chelmsford Crown Court heard that . Olivia and Charlotte were killed on December 3, 2005, as they crossed a . footpath leading to Elsenham station platform. The court was told that the pair . 'seemed happy' and were chatting and holding hands moments before their . deaths. The crossing was fitted with warning lights and alarms. A London-to-Cambridge train passed . over the crossing with the red lights and yodel sounding - a warning for . foot passengers not to cross. After the train passed, the lights . remained on and the alarms continued to sound as another train, . travelling from Birmingham to Stansted Airport in Essex, was going to . pass through the station. The girls opened the unlocked wicket . gates and walked on to the crossing. They were both struck by the . Stansted train and killed. The court heard that a safety official . had raised concerns about the possibility of tragedy in a memorandum in . 2001 but the document was not disclosed by Network Rail until last . year.

'The company concedes that the procedures or standards in place for . conducting level crossing risk assessments before 2005 were deficient. 'The company unreservedly apologises for its failures which contributed to the deaths of these young girls.

Addressing a harsh backlash from lawmakers, Google is seeking to clarify ‘the real story’ about its controversial new privacy consolidation efforts that were launched earlier this week. On Tuesday, the internet company announced it would collect data used as part of a new effort to make the consumer experience better by unifying 60 privacy policies. But eight members of Congress fired back, sending a letter to Google expressing concern that the merging of information could make it more difficult for consumers to protect their privacy. Streamlined experience: Google says its new condensed privacy policy allows for a better experience . ‘While Google suggests that the purpose of this shift in policy is to make the consumer experience simpler, we want to make sure it does not make protecting consumer privacy more complicated,’ the letter to Google CEO Larry Page read. Google, in a statement from policy manager Betsy Masiello, insisted on Thursday that users had 'choice and control.' 'We're not collecting more data about you. Our new policy simply makes it clear that we use data to refine and improve your experience on Google,' she wrote. 'We're making things simpler and we're trying to be upfront about it. Period.' Addressed: Members of Congress wrote a letter to Google CEO Larry Page, pictured, voicing concerns over the new policy . She wrote the changes have been misunderstood. She said that users don’t have to be logged in to use Google search and YouTube. When a consumer is not logged into Google, no data is collected. She also said there are several . privacy measures Google users can utilise, including ‘incognito mode’ on . Google Chrome and going ‘off the record’ on Gchat. Ms Masiello pointed out that one doesn’t have to use all of Google’s products. Google, whose offerings include its flagship search product, Gmail, YouTube and Google+ products, said it would 'mean a simpler, more intuitive Google experience.' Online privacy has come under scrutiny from Washington as a handful of web giants have been accused of compromising user privacy to attract advertisers.

Tragic: Anne-Marie Ellement claimed she was branded a liar after saying she was raped by two colleagues . The sister of a woman soldier who hanged herself after saying two colleagues raped her has demanded the Armed Forces watchdog launch an independent investigation. Military policewoman Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, was found dead at Bulford Barracks near Salisbury, . Wiltshire, on October 9 last year, shortly after returning from sick . leave. Her sister Sharon Hardy yesterday made a formal complaint - and demanded that the Service Complaints Commissioner looks into the case. Anne-Marie, originally from Bournemouth, was the alleged victim of a drunken sex attack by . two serving soldiers in her unit when they were posted together to Germany. No one was ever charged in connection with the alleged attack which was dismissed by prosecutors in January 2010. The Corporal also claimed she was bullied by other soldiers after making the complaint. Ms Hardy has called for the tragedy to be re-investigated. She said she entrusted her sister to the care of the Armed Forces. In her letter handed to The Times, Ms Hardy said that her sister's life was 'being made hell' while she was in the military. The Royal Military Police, who investigated the rape claim, have launched an internal investigation to look at whether any actions that were taken by personnel were 'wrong or inappropriate'. The Service Prosecuting Authority (SPA), outside the army, examined the evidence gathered by the military police but no further . action was taken.

'Annie-Marie joined the Army a happy, confident young lady with hopes and dreams for the future, embarking on a career which several of her family members had joined,' she wrote. 'I trusted her into your care, giving her the support and encouragement to join the armed forces.' She claimed that following the alleged rape, Anne-Marie's witness statement was altered before the SPA decided no charges should be brought. She added: 'I am led to believe one main witness changed her statement and this was passed on to the SPA who felt there was no longer enough evidence to prosecute.' Ms Hardy has asked to know whether her sister was drunk at the time of the alleged rape. An inquest ruled last month that she took her own life. It is the role of the Service Complaints Commissioner to look at her complaint and analyse the comments the coroner made when he recorded his verdict, before deciding whether to pursue the case.

Iguana need some help: A firefighter gives oxygen to an iguana that was rescued from the blaze . Many of the animals had escaped their cages and were roaming free as the inferno tore through the shop. The team had to 'crawl' through a dense undergrowth of potted plants shrouded in smoke to reach the stricken animals, not knowing what would be lurking around the corner. 'The property had a complicated layout with branches and leaves hanging down,' said Steve, Blue Watch manager from Wennington Fire Station. More...

No animals escaped, but five lizards sadly perished in the blaze. Perilous: The store was home to a menagerie of dangerous creatures, including and Europe's biggest anaconda . The surviving animals have been relocated to the owner’s other shop in the same road called Cold Blooded Reptile Centre. Terry Fisk was driving past the shop at around 10pm when he saw the blaze. He said: 'It was very chaotic and it was bit of a shock. 'I really feel for the animals and I am really surprised that more of them did not die because there was so much smoke.'

Steve added: 'We had visited the premises only a few months ago so that in the event of a fire, they would know what to do.

The truce - which is just about holding - is at the centre of . international envoy Kofi Annan's six-point plan to stop the slide toward . civil war and launch talks on a political transition. Although the ceasefire has been 'relatively respected', the regime has ignored at least two major points in the plan - to send forces back to their barracks and to allow peaceful demonstrations. Troops remain in towns and cities, and the regime insisted that demonstrators seek government permits. Syria's state news agency SANA blamed two of the deaths on the opposition, saying an 'armed terrorist group' shot dead the man in Salqeen and they attributed the death of the Hama protester to a shot fired by a fellow demonstrator. There were few reports of violence elsewhere, but activists said security forces were out in strength to prevent any major anti-Assad rallies around the country. Demonstration: Syrians gather in the Damascus suburb of Duma after Friday prayers as an uneasy truce just about holds . Assad's opponents had called for mass demonstrations to test whether the authorities would tolerate a return to peaceful protests, as Annan's six-point peace plan said they should. Pockets of fighting were also reported near . the Turkey-Syria border but the UN said the amnesty was generally being . 'relatively respected'. An advance team of United Nations observers were standing ready to enter Syria to monitor the tense situation, a spokesman said. Anti-regime protest: Forces loyal to the Government have been trying to halt the demonstrations today after a ceasefire came into effect yesterday . Ahmad Fawzi said the team would . prepare the way for a full mission of up to 250 observers on the ground . if the UN Security Council gives approval as hoped when it meets later . today. He said the full . mission would help keep the peace 'if the ceasefire holds and it turns . into a genuine cessation of hostilities'. Syrian . forces tightened security in public squares and outside mosques on . Friday after opposition leaders called for widespread protests. Large anti-government protests were reported in several cities, . including Deir al-Zour, on Thursday evening, and opposition groups have . called for further demonstrations after Friday prayers, as has become . the tradition. Protest:A Syrian protester waves a pre-Baath Syrian flag during an anti-regime demonstration in Dael in the southern Daraa province latelast night as thousands of Syrians flooded the streets on the first day of the ceasefire . Tense: But despite the protests, Syrian forces upped security in to deal with any violence that may break out . French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Assad's ceasefire declaration was insincere and renewed a call for the creation of aid passages, without saying how these could be protected. 'I firmly believe the international community should live up to its responsibilities and create the conditions for humanitarian corridors so that these poor people who are being massacred can escape a dictator,' he told TV channel i>tele. Sarkozy said he had discussed Syria with U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday and they had talked about sending in U.N. observers to verify compliance with the ceasefire. The U.N. Security Council was to vote on the mission later today, with an advance party of 10 to 12 expected to reach Syria next week before the deployment of up to 250 monitors.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 00:12 EST, 16 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 00:13 EST, 16 March 2012 . The Manhattan madam is hinting that she’s ready to cop a plea, but is showing some customer loyalty and vowing not to name names. A lawyer for accused madam Anna Gristina who was caught running a multimillion-dollar brothel said Thursday he wants to explore the possibility of a plea deal, though he cautioned that he was only gauging options. Meanwhile, Gristina remained behind bars as she changed lawyers and, with that, the unconventional contours of a plan for her now-prior attorney to put up his downtown Manhattan loft to secure her $2million bond. Plain Jane: Her husband Kelvin Gorr took her new clothes to wear for her third court appearance but even in the black and white dress she looked far from the multimillion-dollar brothel madam she is alleged to be . Third appearance: Anna Gristina, centre, with attorneys Gary Greenwald, left, and Elise Rucker, right, as she appears in State Supreme Court today to be denied bail . Gristina, 44, has been at the center of a New York media furor since news of the case broke last week, two weeks after her arrest and five years into an investigation by prosecutors who specialize in cases that involve allegations against police. Prosecutors say the Scotland-born suburban mother of four provided pricey prostitutes to well-heeled clients for 15 years and touted ties to law enforcement, saying her connections could tip her off if trouble loomed. Alleged accomplice: Jaynie Mae Baker turned herself in as a co-defendant of Gristina though Baker was released on $100,000 bail . So far, only Gristina and Jaynie Baker, 30, her glamorous matchmaking recruiter accused of helping run the alleged prostitution ring, have been arrested; both have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors have said their investigation is continuing. Gristina's new lawyer, Gary Greenwald, told a court Thursday that he wanted to meet with prosecutors ‘with a view toward a disposition or resolving the matter.’ While plea discussions are common, not all defense lawyers choose to mention publicly that they plan to engage in them, at least not until a trial nears. Mr Greenwald said later that he just wants to find out what kind of plea deal Gristina might be offered. ‘You always ask, “What's the possibility of a plea?”‘ Mr Greenwald said outside court. ‘It doesn't mean we're going to do a plea.’ It's unclear how much either side might be willing to accommodate the other. Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Charles Linehan said during Thursday's hearing that if Gristina were convicted, there might be a good argument for giving her the maximum sentence of up to seven years in prison. Alleged accomplice: Jaynie Mae Baker, 30, . appeared in court on Tuesday with her attorney Robert Gottlieb, left, on a . single charge of promoting prostitution . Appearance: Jaynie Mae Baker, co-defendant of accused 'Soccer Mom' Madam Anna Gristina, in handcuffs just before her arraignment at New York State Court on Tuesday . Meanwhile, Gristina has signaled that . she isn't eager to aid prosecutors' investigation. She told the New York . Post in a jail interview last week that she'd ‘bite my tongue off . before I'd tell them anything.’ Echoing comments his client made to the newspaper, Greenwald said Thursday that authorities pressed Gristina for hours after her February 22 arrest about whether she'd provided prostitutes to certain men, telling her that ‘if you cooperate, you can walk out of here.’ Linehan said prosecutors wouldn't disclose the details of any discussions they had with Gristina. Prosecutors in the police-corruption unit sometimes ‘start with the low-hanging fruit, and they work their way up,’ so Gristina's help - or lack of it - could be key to the direction of the investigation, said Peter E. Brill, a defense lawyer who has represented police officers in such cases. He's not involved in the case against Gristina. One of Gristina's previous lawyers, Peter J. Gleason, told a judge earlier this week that he'd put up his $2.5million downtown Manhattan loft for the bond because he said that she did not have the money to put up her own bond. He also offered to have Gristina and her family move in with him, with her under house arrest and electronic monitoring in her family’s home in Monroe, New York. Prior arrangement: Prosecutors questioned why her former attorney Mr Gleason was so forthcoming and offered to allow her to live in his apartment with her family rather than remain in jail . Old and new: Peter Gleason, left, stepped aside as Gristina's attorney but offered that she and her family use his Tribeca apartment as collateral for her bail, and her new lawyer is Gary Greenwald, right . Prosecutors said the proposal raised ethical questions, and Thursday's hearing was intended to examine the issue. But Gleason said he was stepping down from representing Gristina, though he's still offering his apartment for her bail. ‘I think it's the right thing to do,’ he said after court. The house arrest plan is off the table because the apartment would be too crowded with Gristina’s entire family joining Mr Gleason’s in the apartment, Mr Greenwald said later. Support: Husband Kelvin Gorr, seen with her in a steamy personal photo, visited his wife at Rikers Island yesterday to bring her a change of clothes . Standing by his woman: Kelvin Gorr, husband of . Anna Gristina, who has been charged with promoting prostitution, shows . up at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan today as his wife is denied . bail again . State Supreme Court Justice Juan . Merchan said Gristina's newly hired lawyers, Mr Greenwald and Elise L. Rucker, needed to complete official paperwork before he could consider . the plan. Prosecutors have called Gristina a flight risk. They . say they believe she made millions, has money stashed away to flee and . has shown a willingness to try to run from trouble, once going to . Montreal for a time in 2008 when some other high-profile prostitution . investigations were in the news, including the federal case that spurred . then-Governor Eliot Spitzer's resignation. Mr Spitzer was never charged but publicly identified as a client of a call-girl ring at the heart of that case. New York: The DA's office raided the 'brothel at  304 East 78th Street on the day Gristina was arrested . Double life: The suburban home Gristina and . Kelvin Gorr live in with their son Nicholas and their pigs and dogs in . Monroe, upstate New York, was also raided the day she was arrested . Mr Greenwald tried to persuade the judge to lower Gristina's bond. He called the Canada trip a ‘red herring,’ noting that she had a home there and wasn't facing charges at the time. He noted that her alleged accomplice, Ms Baker, was released on $100,000 bond after turning herself in this week and that both women are facing only a single, low-level, non-violent felony charge. ‘You put (bond) at $2million, under the theory of what?’ he asked Merchan. The judge acknowledged that the bond was ‘fairly high’ for a person who has never been arrested before. But he said he didn't see any cause so far to reduce it. Mr Greenwald and Ms Rucker replaced a court-appointed lawyer, Richard Siracusa. Mr Gleason was working for free since he said Gristina is broke. Mr Greenwald said her relatives and friends were paying his fees.","Anna Gristina will go back to Rikers Island prison .

The News of the World was so intent on surveillance that even the paper's own editor Rebekah Brooks had her office bugged, it has been claimed. Labour MP Tom Watson made the allegations in his new book on the scandal engulfing Rupert . Murdoch’s News International empire. He says Mrs Brooks came under surveillance by June last year as a police . inquiry into hacking gathered pace. Allegations: Labour MP Tom Watson says the NOTW bugged Rebekah Brooks' (right) office in his new book . In ‘Dial M For Murdoch’ he claims: ‘According to one well-placed News Corp source, security . staff were ordered to record the times of Brook's entry to and exit from . Thomas More Square [News International's headquarters] and cleaners . were warned to avoid disturbing listening devices placed under the table . and by her computer in her office.’ The frontbencher also claimed MPs had . their private lives probed and reporters were ordered to dig up dirt on . them in order to dissuade them from investigating the phone hacking at . the newspaper. And he says that the paper sought to strike a deal with him, agreeing they would ‘give him’ Andy Coulson – the former News of the World editor who became David Cameron’s communications chief – as long as he agreed to leave Mrs Brooks alone. Watson says the paper tried to strike a deal with him, agreeing they would ‘give him’ Andy Coulson, left, if he agreed to leave Ms Brooks alone. Right, Neville Thurlbeck says reporters investigated MPs, Watson claims . Mr Watson quotes claims by the . paper’s former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck that a team of reporters . was charged with investigating the private life of members of the . Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. ‘There . was an edict that came down from the editor and it was “find out every . single thing you can about every single member,’ Mr Thurlbeck is quoted . as saying. ‘Who was gay, who had affairs, anything we can use. Each . reporter was given two members and there were six reporters.’ Mr . Watson quotes the gay Plaid Cymru MP Adam Price, who said: ‘I was told . by a senior Conservative member of the committee, who I knew was in . direct contact with executives at News International, that if we went . for her, they would go for us - effectively they would delve into our . personal lives in order to punish [us].’ Mr Watson says this alleged intimidation was initially successful and contributed to a decision not to summon Mrs Brooks to give evidence in 2010. Mr Watson claims that cleaners were warned to avoid disturbing listening devices placed under the table and by her computer in her office at News International's London HQ (pictured) ‘I am sorry to say that this tactic was successful, the committee's legitimate investigation was undermined and parliament was, in effect, intimidated,’ he writes. ‘News International thought it could do this, that they would get away with it, that no one could touch them, and they actually did it, and it worked.’ Mrs Brooks has subsequently given evidence as the committee’s probe widened. Mr Watson says two intermediaries approached him as the inquiry continued with a view to striking a deal. ‘Two intermediaries close to News International offered a deal. One told Watson the company would “give him” Andy Coulson, but Rebekah Brooks was “sacred”,’ says the book. Mr Watson says he fell out with News International after he turned against Tony Blair, a politician the newspaper group supported. He says the stress of his investigations cost him his marriage. Mr Watson claims a female ‘intermediary’ from News International, also asked him if he would like to meet Rupert Murdoch for dinner to thrash out their differences. She allegedly told him: ‘He's a charismatic man. He'd want to square off these difficulties and put matters right.’ Watson says he was not interested in cutting a deal. A spokesman for News International said the group has no comment on Mr Watson's allegations about intermediaries or surveillance.","He also claims reporters were ordered to dig up dirt on MPs to dissuade them from investigation phone hacking .

Two years later Mr Kelly went into business on his own using a Bedford van travelling 20 miles on every round and going through up to four gallons of ice cream a day. Since then he has converted a variety of different vehicles including an ambulance, a water board van and a former Royal Mail vehicle, fitting them all with the distinctive ice cream van jingle. He eventually expanded his business and uses his van as a miniature shop selling sweets, crisps and even mobile phone credit top ups.

An inquest into the death of a six-year-old at a campsite, heard today her parents discovered the young girl 'unresponsive' in the tent they were sharing. Isabelle Harris became ill at Holmsley campsite in the New Forest, Hampshire on Friday and suffered  a heart attack on the way to Southampton Hospital. Histology and toxicology reports have now been ordered in an attempt to discover why the little girl died, the court in Southampton was told. Tragic: An inquest into the death of six-year-old Isabelle Harris, heard today her parents discovered the young girl 'unresponsive' in the tent they were sharing . Coroner’s officer Howard Willis said that shortly after midnight Isabelle had been found 'unresponsive' in the tent. When ambulance crews arrived they found her parents, Lee, 30, and Tracey, 40, trying to revive  Isabelle, their only child. Paramedics took her to Southampton . General Hospital, but she had a cardiac arrest on the journey and was pronounced dead on arrival at 1.16am on April 6. 'Concerns were expressed by a . paediatric consultant about her condition, so it was decided that a post . mortem should take place with a Home Office pathologist,' Mr Willis explained. Police initially reacted by arresting Isabelle’s parents on suspicion of murder, but released them later without charge. Death: Isabelle Harris went into cardiac arrest at the Holmsley campsite in the New Forest, Hampshire, early on Friday . Distraught: Some campers were so upset by the incident they decided to end their Easter weekend break early and go home . The youngster’s parents from Gosport, Hants, did not attend the brief hearing. Mr Denson adjourned the hearing until a date to be fixed and said the case was now transferred to the Bournemouth coroner. Police said the death had been a 'tragic incident.' Mr and Mrs Harris released a . statement which said they were devastated at the loss of the youngster . who they described as 'our whole world.' 'No words are strong enough to . describe how we feel at the moment. Isabelle was our whole world; . everything we ever did was for her.

Mr Denson warned the media not to draw 'premature conclusions' about the cause of death until the full inquest. Last week the blue family tent, which sleeps up to six people, was guarded by police officers and the field was cordoned off.

The online bully who targeted dead teenagers and cruelly mocked their deaths has been spared jail and banned from social networking sites today for 'trolling' about a tragic schoolgirl. Sean Duffy, 26, from Reading, Berkshire, . had admitted defacing a tribute site . set up to remember Sophie Taylor, 16, between April 18 and 20 last year. The teenager was shot accidentally by her boyfriend, 18-year-old trainee gamekeeper Calum Murray, who then turned the gun on himself at a cottage near Tomintoul, Moray in Scotland, that month. Troll Sean Duffy posted obscene abuse about dead Sophie Taylor (left) while the father Charlotte Porter (right) suspects the autistic loner of targeting his dead daughter . At Aberdeen Sheriff Court today, . Duffy was sentenced to a community payback order with supervision for . two years and told to do 300 hours of unpaid work. He . is also banned from creating any accounts on social networking sites . and is not allowed to post any videos or buy any device with internet . access. Andrew Richardson, . district procurator fiscal for Aberdeen and Stonehaven, said after the . sentencing: 'The cruel and callous actions of Sean Duffy added to what . was already a very distressing and traumatic time for people trying to . come to terms with the loss of a loved one. Community order: Sean Duffy has been spared jail for his malicious online campaign . 'Online . behaviour such as this is deplorable and unacceptable. As prosecutors, . we will take a rigorous and firm approach to any such vile offences, . ensuring criminals like Sean Duffy are prosecuted.' Duffy . appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court on February 17 and pleaded guilty to . one charge under Section 38 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing Act . 2010. The unemployed . troll had previously been imprisoned for 18 weeks after admitting . sending malicious communications in a similar case. Sophie's trainee gamekeeper boyfriend Calum killed the Scottish schoolgirl when the gun he was cleaning apparently went off. He then turned the gun on himself. Duffy, an autistic alcoholic, was accused of posting fake photos of Sophie with bullet holes in her head. Duffy earlier admitted he was hooked on 'trolling' – where internet users deliberately leave abusive and bullying comments on networking sites to provoke others. A court heard he trawled the internet looking for tribute sites, before hijacking them with obscene messages. Grieving father Trevor Porter, from Maidstone, Kent, said Duffy may have targeted tributes for his daughter Charlotte, who died of DVT. The 17-year-old cheerleader died last year from a huge blood clot after suffering deep vein thrombosis. A hateful Facebook tribute page was then set up under the cruel name 'Charlotee Pikey' showing a mocked-up photo of her with crosses over her eyes, acne on her face and a caption saying 'DVT Kills Pikeys Dead'. The troll who set the page up also defaced a picture of her grave with the caption 'My swanky new home - rent free, Ha Ha Ha'. Mr Porter, 64, said last year that the cowardly attacks had devastated the family and caused them more pain as they mourned the A Level student. He said the similarities between the attacks and Duffy's obscene online abuse had led him to suspect the jailed troll for being responsible for the hurtful images. He told said Duffy should be forced to see the pain he had caused: 'He should be made to visit the graves of those kids and see the grief he caused. We are serving a life sentence and shouldn't have to endure this too.' Sean Duffy caused ‘untold distress’ by mocking 15-year-old schoolgirl Natasha MacBryde who committed suicide,  leaving obscene messages and videos on a condolence page set up by her family. He branded the public schoolgirl a ‘spoiled little ****’ and attached to her tribute site another Facebook page entitled Tasha MacTank Engine featuring a video in which her face was put on a train with the theme to Thomas the Tank Engine playing in the background. He mocked up disgusting images like the one pictured. Duffy created a Facebook page attacking 14-year-old Lauren Drew, who died in January following an epileptic fit at her home in Gloucester. Fuelled by alcohol, he cruelly targeted her grieving mother, impersonating her dead daughter on the website, saying: ‘Help me Mummy, it’s hot in Hell’ and captioned images of the girl with 'Lauren's rotting body'. On Mother's Day he taunted her mother Carole, pretending to be her daughter, writing 'I can't get out of my coffin, I have scratched my fingers to the bone'. Duffy also targeted a site for 16-year-old Hayley Bates, of Biddulph, Staffordshire, who died in a car crash on the M6 last September. He called it 'Hayley Smash Nissan' and doctored a photo of her with crosses over her eyes, with a picture of the victim captioned 'used car for sale' and 'one useless owner'. He created a page called ‘Jordan Cooper rest in pieces’ for a 14-year-old who was stabbed to death in Newcastle upon Tyne, in February 2011.","Sean Duffy posted online abuse about tragic gun victim Sophie Taylor, 16 .

Who knows what will happen when Ashley gets back from his holiday.’ The news comes amid concerns over Cheryl’s well being after it was revealed the singer has been dropped from an exclusive royal dinner party. Cheryl had apparently been planning . to make her comeback at the event, held for the Duke and Duchess of . Cambridge when they arrive in Los Angeles next month. Home sweet home: Cheryl spent the night at Hurtmore House, Surrey set on a 12 acre estate worth £5 million . But her invitation to the party has now been withdrawn following her firing from the U.S. X Factor, it has been claimed. A source told the News of the World: 'It's yet another blow for Cheryl and the last thing she needs at the moment. The whole of Hollywood wants an invite to this dinner. 'But without the X Factor, there is no reason for her to be there. It would have been the event where she shone with all America looking for the first time.' And the 27-year-old singer, who is now said to have been replaced by TV chef Gordon Ramsay, apparently told friends she is planning on taking an indefinite break from the showbiz world. Speaking through a friend, Cheryl is quoted as telling the Sunday Mirror: 'I need a break. I need to rest and I need to reassess what I’m doing with my life. I haven’t had a break for nine years and I’m exhausted from it all. For once now I am going to take some time out. 'I’ve not worked for a few weeks now and for once I don’t have to worry about anything. For once I can have some time for myself – not worry about X Factor, not worry about recording an album, not worry about anything. Before the storm: Cheryl had been enjoying a series of public appearances, including a trip to the Cannes Film Festival (left), at the preliminary X Factor USA auditions and at a FOX party (right) 'Suddenly I’m under no pressure and I . actually feel the happiest I’ve felt in a long, long time. I’ve got a . big place, I have enough money – and if I never get photographed again, I . don’t care. 'I’ve . always had people saying ""we need to put an album out, we need to record . it now"" and ""we have to rehearse for this tour and that tour’ and ‘now . we need to do auditions for X Factor"". 'I need to take a good few months off now – something I’ve never done before.' And it seems Cheryl is determined to take her break behind closed doors, as the singer hasn't been seen for 25 days. The last image of Cheryl was when she was seen putting on a brave face for the camera as she posed with a fan at the Cliveden Hotel in Berkshire just hours before her X Factor exit was announced. Former colleagues: Paula Abdul tweeted that Cheryl had sent her a huge bunch of flowers, showing the singer isn't holding a grudge about her axe . A source told the Sunday People: 'Cheryl . doesn't deal with a crisis well. Behind the smiles and the glamour she . can be quite insecure. 'Dealing with her marriage split was hard but her career was a massive help to her then. She also had Simon by her side and I think she thought he'd always be there for her, helping guide her through the pitfalls. 'So this has hit her very hard and she can't face the outside world at the moment.' It has also been claimed that Cheryl . has now moved out of her £3.1million north London home, and has taken . her belongings to an international cargo facility. The property, which comes complete with its own cinema, has apparently already been listed online.

"By . David Wilkes . UPDATED: . 10:54 EST, 18 November 2011 . The world is hardly short of pictures of Kate Moss. But for some people, seeing her on billboards or in magazine shoots is obviously not enough. Today an original print of a nude shot of her taken in her early days of modelling - and said to be one of her personal favourites - sold for £16,250 at auction. The 57in by 45in black and white image was taken in Marrakech, Morocco, by fashion photographer Albert Watson on a shoot for the German edition of Vogue  in January 1993. Iconic: The shot shows Miss Moss, then in her late teens, kneeling on a roof-top, with a crooked leg covering her modesty, and encapsulates the controversial 'waif' look . ‘I still think these are among the best pictures ever taken of her and she said so as well recently,’ Watson has said. The iconic shot shows Croydon-born Miss Moss, then in her late teens, kneeling on a roof-top, with a crooked leg covering her modesty, and encapsulates the  controversial ‘waif’ look which helped cement her fame. Her slender frame and gamine charm bucked the trend of the more curvaceous supermodels of the 1990s like Cindy Crawford and Elle Macpherson - and also fuelled the debate on size-zero fashion. For her part, Miss Moss, now 37, said at the time: ‘I’m not as thin as people think… I eat normal things. I don’t diet to look like this.’ Newlyweds: Kate Moss with husband Jamie Hince, who she married in July . Prized: The print of Kate Moss, taken in her early modelling days, is said to be one of her personal favourites . The print, sold at Bonhams in London to an anonymous UK private buyer, is one of a limited edition of ten. Another edition of four prints of the same photo but in a larger size also exists, and one of those sold for £54,000 four years ago. Experts said that reflects the greater rarity of the larger version, rather than a decline in popularity of shots of Miss Moss among collectors. The print  sold yesterday was put up for sale by an unnamed seller with an estimate of  £12,000 to £18,000. Last night photography specialist Jocelyn Phillips of Bonhams, said its value lay in a combination of factors, including the kudos of owning a famous  photographer’s original print. ‘Kate Moss is a contemporary icon and the photographer is a well-established name,’ she said. ‘Combine that with the size and limited edition nature of this lot and it all combines to make it interesting to collectors.’ Two other photographs of (a fully clothed) Miss Moss, auctioned in two separate lots at the same sale, were each bought for £2,750 yesterday. One shows her with her eyes shut and was taken by the late Corinne Day for The Face magazine in 1991 for a feature entitled ‘Heaven is Real’. The other, by Mario Testino in 2005, shows her sitting in a café wearing a tie.","Iconic print is one of the model's personal favourites .

"By . Rachel Quigley . UPDATED: . 10:43 EST, 10 July 2011 . Smiles: When Casey is released next week she will NOT be appearing on the Jerry Springer show as first reported . She was probably already spending the money in her head as she lay in her cell patiently waiting for her imminent release. But it appears Casey Anthony needn't bother because she may not be 'cashing in' on the death of her daughter Caylee as much as was first predicted. It was thought that the accused child murderer could have raked in millions of dollars from TV appearances, interviews, penning her memoirs, a movie about the tragedy and even a career in the porn industry. And no sooner had she been acquitted on all counts except for lying to police than reports surfaced that the folks at Jerry Springer had offered Anthony, her parents and her brother $1million to appear on the show. But now the show's publicist Gary Rosen has rubbished the claims, saying there was never such an offer and there never will be in the future. According to reports, the $1million offer was made to Casey's defence team on Friday and that they said she was interested. But Gary Rosen insisted to The Hollywood reporter: 'There is absolutely no truth to this story whatsoever. The Jerry Springer Show has not made any monetary offer to Casey Anthony and her family to appear on the programme, nor will we.' Al Taylor, a freelancer who works for the show, said: 'The Springer show got immediate backlash after the news was leaked and so they decided they didn't want any part of it any more.' Casey became one of the most vilified woman in America, condemned as a compulsive liar and heartless mother who murdered her daughter by suffocating her with duct tape. Dumped: Defence attorney Jose Baez has been dropped by Paradigm talent agency only two days after he was signed up . New Friends: Casey Anthony has nowhere to go when she leaves jail but it is thought she may stay with Defense Counsel Cheney Mason and Dorothy Clay Sims . The Jerry Springer Show is world-famous for its controversial guests and gritty subject matters which often lead to friends or family members become involved in physical violence and verbal abuse as truths and secrets are revealed. No access: Cindy Anthony tried to visit her daughter in jail yesterday but was snubbed . The Anthonys may have been perfect candidates for the show after Casey's defence team accused her father George of molesting her when she was a child and claimed she was too intimidated by him to report the accidental drowning of her daughter Caylee. Mr Anthony was also accused of having extra-marital affairs behind his wife's back, while the prosecution also accused Casey - who has blamed numerous men for the paternity of Caylee - of sleeping around right after her daughter's death. Anthony was sentenced to serve four years for the convictions of lying to law enforcement, but will be released later this month for time served and good behaviour. Her defence attorney Jose Baez, who has enthusiastically courted the fame and publicity that the case has brought him, especially since the acquittal, has also had his dreams of a TV career shattered. Talent agency Paradigm signed him on Thursday, two days after he and the rest of the defence team basked in the glory of their win at court. But sources have now said that the agency has decided not to represent the controversial attorney despite announcing that it had signed him and would be handling him in areas including broadcasting, books, film and TV movie rights. Sources within the agency did not provide a reason why Baez would not be represented there, but an email went around the agency Thursday night simply stating: 'We have informed Jose Baez tonight that we will not be representing him.' Mystery: No one except the Anthony family will ever know what happened to little Caylee, whose death has outraged a nation . Meanwhile Casey Anthony rejected a jailhouse visit from her mother Cindy as her parents tried to speak to her for the first time on Friday since she was acquitted of killing her two-year-old daughter Caylee . Cindy Anthony made an appointment to visit her 25-year-old daughter at Orange County jail, Florida, at 7pm but Anthony refused to see her. Mrs Anthony was due to go to the prison - where her daughter must spend another nine days after being found guilty of lying to police - without her husband George Anthony. Anthony’s refusal to speak to her mother is the latest sign of how estranged she is from her parents. The snub has led to speculation of where Anthony will go when she is freed next Sunday.","Jerry Springer producer says show will never pay Anthony after reports of $1m deal .

"By . Mark Duell and Mail On Sunday Reporter . UPDATED: . 20:11 EST, 3 July 2011 . Baroness Thatcher has cancelled plans to attend the unveiling of Ronald Reagan’s statue on Monday due to growing mental and physical frailty. She had hoped to be present at the U.S. Independence Day celebrations to honour her political soulmate in London’s Grosvenor Square. But it has been decided that the 85-year-old former Prime Minister will find it too tiring to sit for an hour in front of the world’s media. Model: A maquette of the Ronald Reagan memorial bronze statue to be unveiled in London on Monday . Big effort: Margaret Thatcher, right, who rarely appears in public, is 'determined' to attend the unveiling of a statue for now-deceased Ronald Reagan, right, on Independence Day (they are pictured in 1982) The unveiling of the 10ft bronze will be the third major event she has missed recently, including the Royal Wedding. Foreign Secretary William Hague and . former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice are due to attend the . ceremony, along with 1,000 fans of the former American President. Sources close to the former Prime . Minister say she is bitterly disappointed not to be at the event, . organised on the centenary of Mr Reagan’s birth by the Ronald Reagan . Presidential Foundation. The £500,000 ($800,000) statue’s plinth features one . of Mr Reagan’s many quotes – ‘Freedom is never more than one generation . away from extinction’ – and also a tribute from Lady Thatcher: ‘Ronald . Reagan won the Cold War without firing a shot.’ Political friends: Baroness Thatcher's crucial partnership with Mr Reagan, who died in 2004, is seen by many as the reason for the fall of the Berlin Wall and Soviet Union (they are pictured in 1985) Baroness Thatcher, 85, declined an . invitation to April’s Royal Wedding and could not attend her 85th . birthday party last October because she had flu. But . her crucial partnership with Mr Reagan, who died in 2004, is seen by . many as the reason for the fall of the Berlin Wall and Soviet Union. She called him 'one of the greatest men of our time' and he once told an aide: 'Isn't she marvellous?'. Around 40 per cent of funds for the statue came from UK private donors. ‘Among conservatives (Baroness Thatcher) is something of an icon, and the fact that she and Reagan were close adds to his lustre' Robin Berrington, former cultural . attaché at London U.S. Embassy . Former . U.S. State Secretary Condoleezza Rice will give the keynote address at . the ceremony, which is part of a European tour celebrating what would be . Mr Reagan's 100th birthday. Sir . Malcolm Rifkind, Baroness Thatcher’s Scottish Secretary, said Britons . were at first concerned about Mr Reagan as the thought he lacked . experience. But he told MSNBC that many were won . over by his ‘good judgement, good instincts and guts’ and the British . ‘respect his achievements’. The 10ft bronze monument was sculpted by . Chas Fagan, of North Carolina, and will stand near statues to other former presidents Franklin . Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower. The ‘special relationship’ at work during the time of Mr Reagan and Baroness Thatcher has since been redefined by President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron to an ‘essential relationship’. Freedom Square: U.S. Air Force and Army officers serving in Hungary, pose with another new statue of Mr Reagan after a centennial commemoration in Budapest, Hungary, on Wednesday . Robin Berrington, a former cultural attaché at the U.S. Embassy in London, said the level of interest in the ceremony has ‘a lot to do’ with Baroness Thatcher. ‘Among conservatives she's something of an icon, and the fact that she and Reagan were close adds to his lustre,’ he told MSNBC. It comes after a statue of Mr Reagan was unveiled on Wednesday in Hungary's capital, where he was honoured for his leadership in helping to end communism. The bronze 7ft likeness of the 40th president was erected in Budapest at Freedom Square, near both the U.S. Embassy and a World War Two memorial.","Thatcher and Reagan remembered for partnership in Cold War .
