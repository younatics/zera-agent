"(CNN) -- Didier Drogba came off the bench to rescue a point for Ivory Coast as they drew 1-1 with Malawi on Saturday to book their place at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Didier Drogba scored for Ivory Coast as they drew 1-1 with Malawi to book their place at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Ivory Coast needed only a point from their match with the bottom-placed team in African qualifying Group E but found themselves a goal down in the 64th minute when Jacob Ngwira put the hosts ahead at the Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre. Elephants coach Vahid Halilhodzic responded by throwing on Chelsea striker Drogba who was able to level the scores in the 67th minute. Malawi pushed for a winner as the second half wore on but were unable to add to the score and Ivory Coast secured the point they required for qualification. The result brought Ivory Coast's 100 percent run in the group to an end but ensured they will feature in the World Cup Finals for a second time following their debut appearance in 2006. Malawi also improved their chances of qualifying for the African Cup of Nations by moving third with four points, just behind Burkina Faso who have six and Guinea who are now last with three points. Elsewhere in the African qualifying zone Egypt recorded a 1-0 win over Zambia in their Group C clash in Konkola to potentially set up a deciding match with Algeria in Cairo next month. Egypt were on the back foot in the first half and were indebted to goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary who frustrated the Zambia fans with several fine saves as the visitors struggled to get to grips with the pitch at the Konkola Stadium. But the Pharaohs were a much-improved side after the half-time break and Hosny Abd-Rabou secured all three points with the only goal of the game in the 68th minute. Egypt defender Sayed Moawad laid off the ball for Abd-Rabou to fire a powerful right-footed shot past Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene and into the top corner of the net. The result means qualification will go right down to the wire even if Algeria take maximum points from their clash with bottom side Rwanda on Sunday and go three points clear of Egypt at the top of the group. Cameroon moved a step closer to qualification as they remained top of Group A with an emphatic 3-0 victory over Togo in Yaounde. The Indomitable Lions took the lead in the 32nd minute through Newcastle midfielder Geremi when he smashed home the rebound after Togo goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale had saved his initial shot from the penalty spot. Lyon's Jean Makoun doubled the advantage two minutes after the interval after he tapped home following a mazy dribble by Samuel Eto'o and Achille Emana made the points safe in the 52nd minute with a low drive. Gabon remain a point behind Cameroon after they clinched a 3-1 win over Morocco in Libreville having taken the lead after Hicham Mahdoufi put through his own net moments before half-time. Eric Mouloungou and Daniel Cousin gave Gabon a three-goal lead before Adel Taarabt pulled one back for Morocco with a late consolation. Paul Le Guen's Cameroon side, who had looked doubtful to qualify when he took over, are in pole position at the top of the group with 10 points ahead of Gabon on nine, Togo on five and Morocco with three.","Striker Didier Drogba scored as Ivory Coast drew 1-1 with Malawi in Blantyre .

"Pasadena, Maryland (CNN) -- Children point at the glass as a long train rounds the bend and Thomas the Tank Engine passes overhead. Outside, a flashing red signal tells neighbors it's time to hop aboard. Welcome to John and June Sturgeon's indoor train garden, a collection of model trains the couple have been sharing with friends and neighbors every holiday season for nearly 15 years. ""We love it, that's why we do it,"" says June Sturgeon. The collection began with a train John's father gave him as an infant 62 years ago. John still has the train, and many more. The garden has grown to include 11 intertwined train sets, divided into summer and winter scenes. Once the collection outgrew their house, the Sturgeons built a detached building the size of a two-car garage specifically to hold the display year round. ""I venture to say, each year I put at least a hundred hours in here,"" John says. ""That's before Christmas and setting everything up and changing this around ... and fine-tuning, fixing anything that's broke."" Last year, more than 1,200 people followed the lit path to the backyard garage, including regulars like Jason Gauchier and his two children, who come at least once a week when the display is open. ""They've been looking forward to it for about three months now,"" says Gauchier, who brought his children on opening night as he has for five years. ""And then ... when it closes [they're] looking forward to it next year."" Besides the regulars, there are first-time guests like Sara Dolan, who came with her granddaughter. ""It's absolutely wonderful,"" Dolan said, ""all of the extra things that they've added, it's just fabulous."" The collection can be overwhelming at first, with all of the sounds and flashing lights that fill the building. The miniature villages and communities are filled with happy people, living a peaceful life in a different time. With all the wires out of sight, it looks like magic. The Sturgeons have worked consistently to make additions to the train garden. ""Basically it is an all year thing, but the final push is from September 'til now"" June said. Adds John, ""It usually takes us a month or so to get the backyard here all decorated. ... It's quite a bit of work."" There's a separate garage for repairs. ""There's a train we added this year that has 30 cars on it. Well, it's 29 cars plus the engine makes it 30,"" John says. ""I've tested it a little bit -- I'm hoping we don't have any problems with that, cause that's a pretty long train. So it runs the whole length of a board, approximately 30 feet."" This year John, a retired police officer, also added a scene with a doughnut delivery truck being robbed as a police cruiser comes to the rescue. The regular guests enjoy seeing the new details, but they also come to see Santa Claus. ""Santa Claus is here every night, every night until Christmas, and most of [the children] bring me their wish list,"" John says behind the white beard and red suit. The Sturgeons open their collection for 20 nights each year leading up to Christmas. The evening routine begins with setting up the outside lights and inflatable decorations. Visitors know they've reached the right place when they see the brightest house on the street, complete with holiday music. The front window of the house has a replica of the leg-shaped lamp from the classic holiday movie ""A Christmas Story"". ""It does my heart good to see the little sparkle in their eyes when they come around and see Santa or see the trains, and it lights my heart up.""","Maryland couple open their indoor train garden to the public each holiday season .

"(CNN) -- The owner of a taxidermy school in Blanco, Texas, says he's been receiving more phone calls and attention than he'd like over the identity of a dead roughly 30-pound, mostly hairless coyote-like creature. This strange creature has sparked a media frenzy in Blanco, Texas. ""I don't know what it is. ... I do know that I have an odd animal,"" Jerry Ayer said Thursday. He said word spread quickly that he was in possession of an unknown animal -- often speculated in his region to be chupacabras, or mythical creatures, he said. Soon, the local, national and even international media picked up on what he said could be a ""genetically defective coyote."" ""Chupacabra"" roughly translates from Spanish to ""goat sucker."" Reported victims are said to have puncture wounds to their necks, supposedly where the chupacabra drained their blood.  Watch people examine mystery creature » . ""I don't believe in the chupacabra,"" Ayer said, adding that he's been in the midst of a ""media blitz"" -- receiving 50 phone calls from media outlets and citizens, as well as death threats late at night -- since word got out about the strange beast. ""It's been rough on me,"" he said. ""I'm almost at the point where I'm going to take my sign down and hide under a rock somewhere."" He said he received the body from a former student whose cousin owns the barn where the creature succumbed to poison left for rodents. Before he knew it, he said, word spread that he had a chupacabra. Ayers, who doesn't hunt and regards himself as a wildlife artist, said he intends to stuff and mount the animal. He said Texas A&M University has taken tissue samples to determine exactly what it is, and other universities have also reached out to him. ""It'll probably end up in a museum,"" he said. He's hopeful the attention will soon die down. ""There's no way I could teach with this,"" he said, explaining that his school, Blanco Taxidermy School, generally gives one-on-one instruction in the town of about 1,500 people about 50 miles west of Austin. ""I'm unable to do any of that right now just because of the media frenzy,"" he said.","Word quickly spread about coyote-like body at Texas school .

"Boston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A white van sits at a warehouse loading dock in Boston. Buckled in the front passenger seat is Eeyore, the donkey friend of Winnie the Pooh. ""This is the back seat driver,"" says one of several volunteers removing the stuffed animal and other donated children's items for the local Toys for Tots campaign. The U.S. Marine Corps Reserve program, which began 62 years ago in Los Angeles, California, now gives Christmas presents to underprivileged children in nearly 700 cities and towns across the country. ""We're filling orders like crazy,"" says Kay Carpenter, a volunteer and former Marine. She says that while the local campaign seems to be getting more donations this year, the demand also has risen. ""They go out as fast as they come in."" As large boxes of toys make their way from the loading dock to the warehouse office, volunteers sort the toys by gender and age group and then fill orders they've received from various charitable organizations in the greater Boston area. ""It's been tough for everybody with the economic climate the way it is,"" says Betty Whalen, a volunteer who works sorting the toys. She points out the empty bins normally used to store the toys. Volunteers won't bother putting new donations in the bins, she says, ""because as soon as we sort all of this and start making up orders, it'll be gone."" Last year the economy made it tough for many people, and Toys for Tots was hit hard as well. The Boston office did not have enough toys to fill its orders until some last-minute donations arrived. For 2009, Carpenter says, ""We've run out of some toys, but overall, we're doing better than last year."" Maj. Allen Porter, who runs the Toys for Tots program in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, area, also sees an increased demand this year. But unlike Boston, donations in his area are down. ""Compared to where we were at last year,"" he said, ""we are a little bit below."" Nationally, corporate cash donations are down significantly, about $1.5 million below where they were this time last year, according to Bill Grein, senior vice president of marketing for Toys for Tots. ""That's a lot of presents that we would sure like to have,"" he said. Last year, Toys for Tots collected or bought 16.2 million toys, books and gifts, down from 16.6 million the year before, Grein said. Most donations to the campaign are toys, but the organization raised about $30 million last year through corporate donations, direct mail, individual contributions and online donations. As an indicator, online donations in November were down 10 to 15 percent from the same time last year, he said. Though the program runs year round, this is the season when larger contributions typically come in. ""Every year we count on getting a few Christmas miracles,"" he said, ""So we're hoping that things will pick up now."" For some children, getting a toy has an effect on them that carries through after Christmas morning, Grein said. ""We think that it's important for children to be able to go back to school and enter into conversation about what they got for Christmas,"" he said. ""It's a self esteem and self confidence issue that we think is very important."" Back in Boston, volunteers are taking packaged orders down to the loading dock. Mara Voukidys, from Cambridge Cares About AIDS, watches as her van is loaded with toys. She says for the struggling families who will receive these toys, there is a huge impact. ""At least on Christmas they can give their children a Christmas like any child,"" she said. ""So it's been a huge help.""","Bins used to store toy donations remain empty at Boston Toys for Tots warehouse .

It started out as his cause-celebre a few years back as he was about to graduate from university in New Delhi. Vimlendu says he was disgusted with the pitiful condition of the river Yamuna, considered the sprawling city's lifeline. The Yamuna, which originates in the Himalayas and winds its way past the Taj Mahal, accounts for more than 70 percent of New Delhi's water supply. Yet it is one of the most endangered waterways in India. Vimlendu decided to do something about it. ""Swechha works with young people on issues of environment and citizenship,"" he says. ""Round the year you'll see me travel to different places outside Delhi, engage with young people...(there will be) a lot of change-making that will happen in my story. I promise you that.""

"Scotia, New York (CNN) -- Christina Powell folds the red, white and blue quilt before it is packed up and sent to Andrews Air Force Base, some 400 miles away in Maryland. ""I don't like seeing so many young people go away and come back wounded,"" Powell says. ""Unfortunately right now it's just a fact of life and I try to do what I can. ""Our servicemen need to know that it's not just their family and friends that are supporting them. There's a whole country rooting for them, and I'm one."" The quilt is one of several that Powell and her fellow members of QUILTS -- Quilters United in Learning Together, Schenectady -- have made as part of the Quilts for Injured Soldiers project. ""Several years ago,"" says Powell, ""I heard at our quilting guild meeting that somebody wanted to organize this and get it started in our area, and I thought 'I can do that.' I can just change the fabrics and make it more patriotic. The more I did the more I wanted to do, and now, I just do it. This is my 27th quilt for this project."" The quilt Powell recently made for the project is a large bed quilt. ""We have the red, white and the blue, and the stars and the stripes,"" Powell says as she holds up the quilt top. ""It's perfect, don't you think?"" Powell has been quilting for 25 years, and her sewing room is filled with a wide variety of colorful threads and a seemingly endless supply of yard lengths and squares of fabrics she has collected over the years. ""I've probably made 20 to 30 bed quilts, more than 100 baby quilts for another charity event, and innumerable amounts of wall hangings that I make and give away,"" she says. ""It's my pleasure to make it and to give it. It just makes me feel good."" Finished quilts for soldiers are boxed up and sent to Maryland, where the Quilts for Injured Soldiers project began in 2003. Pat Baker is the project's chairwoman, and the quilts are delivered directly to her front door in Hughesville, Maryland. ""It's like Christmas every day when a box comes in,"" Baker says. ""Especially if you're a quilter. You don't know what you're going to get when you open that box."" As the number of wounded soldiers increased, so did the need for more quilts. Baker and other members of the Quilters Guild of Southern Maryland couldn't handle the need, so they put an ad in a national quilting magazine. ""Now,"" Baker says, ""people from all over the United States, Canada and even Australia have donated quilts."" In her bedroom hallway, several large bags are stuffed full of more than 70 quilts and blankets to be brought to Andrews Air Force Base and handed to the soldiers as they arrive back in the United States. ""Some of our quilts are separated because of the military affiliation. You don't necessarily want to give an Army guy a Marine-themed quilt,"" Baker says, laughing. ""It's all one military, but they each love their specific branch."" A letter is attached to each quilt telling soldiers about the project and thanking them for their service, Baker says. At Andrews, American Red Cross volunteers take over the operation, delivering the quilts to soldiers. Powell's quilt found its new home with Pfc. Jonathan Winker of the Wisconsin National Guard. Winker returned from Iraq with a crushed foot and bruising on his leg. ""When I was passing through all the hospitals and medical centers on my way home, I noticed all these quilts on pretty much all of the hospital beds,"" Winker says. ""Every one was different, and all of them are really beautiful. I think it's awesome that they put their time and effort into making these. It's a great way to say 'thank you' to the wounded soldiers."" Winker, whose father and uncle served in the Marines, said he'll probably put the quilt in his bedroom ""so that it's close to me all the time."" On the back edge of Winker's quilt is a patch sewn in by Powell that reads: ""Thank you for your service to our country. This is a small token of appreciation for all that you have been through. My prayers for you are contained in this quilt.""","Group of quilters in New York sends quilts to project helping injured soldiers .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Jamie Foxx suffered through his own psychological turmoil while plunging into the role of a mentally ill musician in ""The Soloist,"" the actor said. Jamie Foxx plays mentally ill musician Nathaniel Ayers in ""The Soloist."" Foxx, 41, revealed that his bond with Nathaniel Ayers was close because of his own yearlong battle two decades ago -- triggered when ""somebody slipped me something in college and I lost my mind."" ""The Soloist,"" based on a true story, tells how Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez, played by Robert Downey Jr., discovered the homeless Ayers and helped the former music prodigy, who has schizophrenia. The movie comes out Friday. Foxx, who won an Oscar in 2005 for his portrayal of music legend Ray Charles, said he consulted a psychiatrist because he feared what would happen as he took on Ayers' personality. ""I asked very foolishly, 'Can I catch schizophrenia?' and he says, 'No, you can't catch schizophrenia.' "" The doctor warned him he could experience post-traumatic stress, Foxx said. The Los Angeles Times reported that Foxx suffered ""panic attacks and bouts of paranoia"" during filming. Foxx told of one early morning incident when he got so far into Ayers' character that he called his manager and said, ""I know why Nathaniel does this and I'm him!"" ""I explained what I was feeling to him and he said 'Foxx, you're not Nathaniel,' "" he said. Foxx said he had ""a childhood fear of going crazy."" ""There was a sanitarium in my hometown in Terrell, Texas, called the Terrell State Hospital, and when we would visit I would go, 'I hope that never happens to me,' "" he said. He left Texas after high school to attend college on a music scholarship in San Diego, California. ""When I was 18, somebody slipped me something in college and I lost my mind and they had to take me to the hospital,"" Foxx said. ""For 11 months it was tough."" Another student served as his ""angel,"" just as Lopez helped Ayers, Foxx said. ""He'd say, 'You're good, you're not crazy, everything is fine, I'm here with you.' "" Just as Ayers used a cello for comfort, Foxx would use the piano. ""I would play my music to sort of like soothe it,"" Foxx said. His ""bad trip"" subsided after almost a year, but Foxx said he drew on the experience to understand Ayers. ""We had a marriage, myself and Nathaniel,"" he said. ""Here's a person who happened to be great playing the cello. He happened to go to Juilliard. He happened to go to L.A., become homeless and run into his angel, Steve Lopez."" Ayers still lives in Los Angeles and is working part-time as a janitor. The exposure to people who lived on the streets of Los Angeles taught Foxx a positive lesson, he said. ""We had a ball with them,"" he said. ""They love to dance, they love to talk trash. ... They actually had a life. People were smiling and enjoying their lives."" The Oscar buzz is again building for Foxx, who is firmly established as master of the biopic. He said he and his management have ""carved out our own niche."" ""They found this beautiful story, which paralleled my life a little bit,"" he said. Foxx said he's ""got his fingers crossed"" that he will be able to someday bring the character of former heavyweight boxing champ Mike Tyson to the big screen. ""I think there's a beautiful story in it, not like Ali,"" he said. ""Ali was a story of yesterday when our heroes were heroes,"" he said. ""This is a different type of hero story. It's a story of today. It's tragedy. It's a triumph. It's all of it put together."" CNN's KJ Matthews contributed to this story.","Jamie Foxx plays mentally ill homeless man in ""The Soloist""

"Washington (CNN) -- In a warm, fluorescent-lit clay studio at the Corcoran College of Art + Design, students, faculty and a soft-spoken priest are embarking on a mission. Their goal: Create 500 bowls for a fundraiser to help feed the hungry. ""There are over 9,000 homeless people in the nation's capital,"" says the Rev. John Adams, who has been trying to break the cycle of homelessness and hunger in Washington for more than 30 years as president of So Others Might Eat. The interfaith, community-based organization, which is in its 40th year, serves more than 1,000 meals a day and provides nearly 300 housing units to homeless and hungry people in Washington. ""We are in sight of the Capitol and still we have many, many homeless people who need our help,"" Adams said. ""We've seen over a 10 percent increase in the meals we are serving this past year. We've seen a 17 percent increase in the people coming to our medical clinic. Our housing we provide is 100 percent full. ""[The recession] is really affecting the poor."" Each year, So Others Might Eat hosts an Empty Bowls event where, for a $20 donation, guests are served a soup supper and given a handmade clay bowl. The events raise thousands of dollars for the organization, with local potters, studios and schools making and donating the bowls, and restaurants and shops donating the food. This year, for the first time, the group is partnering with the Corcoran to help supply bowls for the fundraiser in March 2010. The bowls are intended as symbols of hunger. ""It's a wonderful event to have these artists come here today to help feed the needy in our city,"" Adams says. However, making bowls is no easy task. ""We are working on a collaborative effort with So Other Might Eat,"" says Bob Devers, coordinator of ceramics at the Corcoran College of Art + Design. ""We promised to produce 500 bowls for their charity fundraiser."" The studio is busy at work, with students and faculty -- and even Adams -- cutting, kneading and spinning the clay into works of art. Corcoran student Jeff Herrity has been working with clay for 10 years, but he's still excited to sit down and create bowls that someone will put to use. ""It's great to spend an entire day making bowls and thinking about what they will be used for, Herrity said. ""We get to sit next to our fellow students and learn their techniques. It's a fun activity for us at the clay program."" Herrity sits on his stool contently, gazing at the clay shape as it opens up into a bowl, thinking about what will go inside. ""It's going to have a life after it comes off this wheel, after it gets fired and glazed, it will be used for something."" As Adams takes a break from designing his first bowl, he looks around and talks with students and faculty. He can't help but be impressed. ""We have great artists and great people here who are interested in helping people in the city,"" he says. Taking time to donate their creative energies, especially during the holiday season, means a lot to Adams. ""The holidays remind us of giving thanks for what we have, but also the opportunities we have for reaching out to others that don't have,"" he says.","Washington organization sells bowls to raise funds to help the hungry, homeless .

"(CNN)  -- Egypt kept their World Cup hopes alive as the only goal of the game by Ahmed Hassan gave them a 1-0 win over Rwanda in Kigali. Star midfielder Ahmed Hassan scored the vital goal for Egypt in Kigali. He scored from an Ahmed Fathi pass after 58 minutes to lift them level on points at the top with Algeria in African Qualifying Group C. But Algeria, who host Zambia on Sunday, can re-open a three point lead with victory. Only the top team in each of the five African groups qualifies for the finals in South Africa next year, with the top three qualifying for the 2010 Nations Cup in Angola. South Africa, who have won the Nations Cup a record six times, have a poor record in World Cup qualifying and have only made two appearances in the final. Saturday's win was vital as they completed the double over Rwanda, having beaten them 3-0 in Cairo two months ago. Substitute Chiukepo Msowoya scored twice after coming on at half-time as Malawi came from behind to defeat Guinea 2-1 in a Group E game between World Cup also-rans. Oumar Kalabane put the West Africans ahead seven minutes before half-time at the Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre, Msowoya leveled a minute after half-time and snatched the 58th-minute winner. African powerhouses Cameroon also scored a much-need qualification win as they beat Gabon 2-0 in Libreville in Group A. Achille Emana and Inter Milan's Samuel Eto'o scored in quick succession in the second half as the 'Indomitable Lions' climbed to second in the group, two points behind Gabon. Cameroon entertain Gabon in Yaounde on Wednesday, looking for a victory which would further boost their chances of going to South Africa. Eto'o was scoring his seventh goal of the qualifying campaign to seal the victory. Ivory Coast kept their iron grip on Group E as two goals from Chelsea striker Didier Drogba saw them beat second-placed Burkina Faso 5-0. The star-studded Ivory Coast team need just a single point to make sure they qualify for South Africa and they were never troubled by the visitors in Abidjan. Drogba took his tally to 38 international goals with his second half double. Kader Keita and Yaya Toure also scored after the Elephants had taken the lead in the 12th minute when Saidou Panandetiguiri scored an own-goal. In the other match in Group E, Chiukepo Msowoya scored twice as Malawi beat Guinea 2-1 in Group E.","Egypt score vital 1-0 win over Rwanda in Kigali to keep World Cup hopes alive .

"This year marks the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Solferino which led to the creation of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The ICRC is using the date to launch an awareness campaign of its work in conflict-affected countries, featuring photos taken by five award-winning photojournalists. This week we're bringing you stories from some of the world's most troubled countries, as told by the ICRC. MONROVIA, Liberia (ICRC) -- On a dusty pitch in the middle of the capital of Monrovia limbless young men play football as though their lives depended on it. Coach Paul Tolbert says many members of Liberia's amputee football team had lost the will to live. Football has given them hope. They are members of the Liberian National Amputee Football Team and for the most part, victims of the war. Some participated in cruel acts against civilians during the fighting and face a daily struggle to live with both their disability and the past. ""I was at church when armed men came in and killed hundreds of us,"" says 18 year old Richard Duo, who is now a star infield attacker and one of the highest goal-scorers on the team. ""I lost my mother, father and one of my brothers. My other siblings were wounded and I lost my leg. ""Now that there is peace, I have decided not to think about that anymore. I only want to look forward, to see what I can do to help myself and my family in the future. Those terrible things have already happened. I just want to focus on the future,"" he says.  See photos of Richard Duo and his team mates » . Tens of thousands of people were killed or injured in Liberia's 14-year civil war. The fighting brought rape and mutilation, children were abducted and forced to become fighters and untold numbers had to flee their homes. Since 2003, peace has returned and while efforts are underway to rebuild the country the emotional and physical scars of war remain. Amputee football began in Liberia as a means of therapy and healing. It was an initiative of the National Commission for Disarmament, Demobilization, Reintegration and Rehabilitation, which is responsible for assisting former fighters. The team's coach, 30 year old Paul Tolbert, began recruiting members when he worked for the commission as a counseling coordinator. ""When you ask them how they felt after they were amputated, most of them wanted to kill themselves,"" says Tolbert. ""Life no longer had meaning for them. Amputee football restores their hope. Take the example of the guy who won Most Valuable Player in the recent African Cup of Nations. He was a very good player before he was amputated, but gave up hope when he lost his leg. ""When I went to recruit him, I told him 'You can make it, there is still a chance for you.' He since has regained a sense of hope.'"" In 2008, the Liberian team hosted the African Cup of Nations and won the tournament. The team has been to Russia and Turkey for international competitions and will travel to England in June for the Amputee World Cup, where they have a very good chance of making it to the final. The President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, is their number one fan, ensuring support for travel and profiling the team in her speeches. Tolbert says the healing effects go well beyond the players. ""I tell my team they are bringing a sense of victory to the country. In my eyes, they are not disabled. They are men who bring pride to this nation."" The players themselves say they are motivated by a desire to leave the war behind and to make something of themselves for their families. They're also looking for a sense of belonging and brotherhood among those who know what it's like to live with the horrors of war and to struggle just to survive. ""I love the sport because I can experience friendship again,"" says Joseph Allen, 21, who was named the best goalkeeper in the Russian tournament. ""Friendship was gone from my life for the longest time. Football brings attention to our disability and helps people better understand that we are able to contribute to society."" For players like 32 year old Anthony Doe, amputee football has opened up a window on a world he never dreamed possible. ""I never thought that one day I would go and see Turkey or Russia but thanks to football I've been able to travel to compete,"" says the striker. For more about this topic go to the ICRC Web Site.

"(CNN) -- As the 20th anniversary of the reunification between East and West Germany approaches, the country's leader says Germany has become ""culturally richer"" as a result. ""We're pleased that the Eastern states have become much stronger, that a lot has been put into action and that Germany has become culturally richer,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told CNNI's ""Connect the World"" on Monday. ""I think it's a wonderful story."" The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 paved the way for reunification a year later with the collapse of Soviet-backed communist governments across Eastern Europe. Germany will officially mark the reunification milestone on Sunday. Merkel, the first former East German to lead the reunified country, praised Germany's strides toward accepting multiculturalism, despite tense relations with the Muslim community across Europe. ""We've taken a remarkable step forward here in Germany,"" she said. ""Before we spoke of multiculturalism, of parallel societies or even in my own party there were those who spoke about guest workers who would soon leave Germany. We've all understood now that immigrants are a part of our country. They have to speak our language, they have to receive an education here."" Merkel also expressed optimism for Germany's economic future. ""It's not guaranteed that the growth we're experiencing now will continue over the years, but I think overall we've acted smartly, G20 worked together well and I'm definitely optimistic that we can get through it, if we regulate the markets prudently and when we find the correct exit strategy after this expensive stimulus program,"" she said.

"CNN -- Michael Chea can't forget what they did to him. Though he is standing in the morning sunlight, surrounded by giggling teenagers and chirping birds, his face is twisted by grief. American John Etherton talks to a Liberian about his country's violent past. He is reliving the moment when he escaped death in the ""land of blood and tears."" ""In 1990, I was a very small, and I saw so many things,"" he said. ""The war took us away in the forest, and we started running. They killed my grandmother. They killed my grandfather. They killed my auntie."" Chea could have easily become just another anonymous victim of war in Liberia. At least 200,000 Liberians were killed in a series of conflicts between 1989 and 2003 that transformed the tiny nation on the west coast of Africa into a wasteland. But Chea found a way to preserve his pain. His story was captured on film by a skinny 27-year-old American college student who is using an interactive video system mounted on a SUV to show others how nations emerging from war can come to terms with their violent past. 'It really feels like the Wild West' John Etherton, a graduate of Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, is a ""post-war correspondent."" He is part of a school program called GTV, or Greater Truth through Voices, that dispatches people through Liberia to record the experiences of war victims like Chea. The Georgia Tech program isn't just concerned with the past; it's preparing Liberians for the future. The collected stories will be sent to Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a group formed to rebuild trust among Liberians by identifying war crimes and encouraging victims to come forward. The commission is holding its final hearing this month and is expected to release its final report soon. Liberia is trying to move away from its violent past. It elected Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Africa's first female head of state, as president in 2006. And the country's former notorious warlord, Charles Taylor, is being tried for war crimes. But Etherton says the country still feels on edge. Streetlights have bullet holes in them, roads aren't paved or free from bandits, and there's no electricity in many cities. ""It really feels like the Wild West,"" Etherton said. ""It's an eerie, surreal feeling to know that this was a war zone five years ago, and people were dying here."" Now Liberians are trying to learn how to live again. Part of that journey begins with listening to one another's stories. That is part of the rationale behind Liberia's commission: A nation that can confront its violent past will have a better shot at a stable future. ""It's necessary for people to talk and share their stories and engage in debate,"" Mike Best said. The Georgia Tech professor says GTV uses a cartoon character who looks and speaks like a typical Liberian to show war survivors how they can record their stories on the mobile video system. ""Ultimately, some transformative truths will allow people to see themselves in a new way."" 'Land of blood and tears' Getting at those truths, though, may require Liberians to sift through some gruesome memories. During its civil wars, various warlords fought for control of the country. The war's savagery turned surreal at times. It spawned thousands of child soldiers clutching AK-47 assault rifles. It featured soldiers charging into battle wearing blond wigs and amulets that they thought would protect them from bullets. And it was propelled by men like Gen. Butt Naked, a warlord who fought in the nude because he thought it would terrorize his enemies. According to Amnesty International, war crimes became routine. Various armed factions engaged in the arbitrary killings of civilians, systematic rape, forced amputations and the abduction of children. Marguerite Michaels, a journalist who took a tour of the country near the end of its last civil war, said in a Time magazine essay that the psychological damage to Liberia's war-weary citizens ""cannot be fathomed."" She spoke of the country's white beaches, marred by corpses sticking out the sand. She called Liberia the ""land of blood and tears."" Etherton soon learned that that the war didn't just leave its mark on Liberia's physical landscape. It left its mark on its people. At times, he would share a joke with an easy-going Liberian and learn later that his entire immediate family had been murdered. ""So many people have lost someone,"" he said. ""No one is unscathed."" Yet getting Liberians to share these stories isn't easy, he says. Many wanted to know whether Etherton was going to provide them with a job when he arrived with his camera. They weren't eager to dredge up painful memories. ""They're coming out survival mode,"" he said. ""They haven't had the luxury of sitting back and discussing the war. Their attitude is more like, what do we have to do right now to not die."" The tangled U.S.-Liberian relationship . Violent divisions have been part of Liberia's history. The country was founded in 1847 by freed slaves traveling from America. During the 19th century, various groups thought the best solution to slavery was returning freed slaves to Africa where they could create colonies. But when freed slaves arrived in Liberia, many recreated the slave-master relationships they experienced in America, historians say. They created a caste system where they were the masters and systematically discriminated against -- and some say enslaved -- the indigenous people of Liberia. Tribal divisions persist in Liberia today, Etherton says. He says he saw evidence of these divisions when President Obama was elected in November. Many Liberians rejoiced but were puzzled when Obama's opponent, Republican Sen. John McCain, appeared on television to graciously concede the election. ""A lot of people thought that was amazing,"" he said. ""They said that would never happen in Africa. No one would ever gracefully bow out."" Perhaps the stories collected by Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission will help teach Liberians how to move forward. It did seem to help Chea, the war survivor, when he shared his story with Etherton. When he speaks about his war experiences, Chea is at first so angry at losing his family that he can barely put his thoughts into words. The muscular young man waves his hands in frustration as he tries to explain what happened to him. Chea says he wishes he had a different childhood, where he didn't have hide for survival in the forest while soldiers hunted down his family. ""In the forest, nothing good I learn,"" he yelled. Then Chea begins to talk about the needs of his country and its war survivors. His voice calms as Etherton keeps the camera rolling. Once, Chea may have been a frightened boy who was hunted by strangers. At least on this day, however, a stranger was treating him like a human being. ""Just to express yourself to someone who cares and to know that your voice is important is very empowering,"" Etherton said later. ""If nothing else, just knowing that someone cares is important.""","Liberia is emerging from 14-year war that turned country into wasteland .

"(CNN) -- Jero is making old, new again in Japan. African-American Jero is famous for singing Japanese enka. The 27-year-old American has made a name for himself singing enka, a traditional form of lounge music that flourished in 1940's Japan. It seems an unlikely musical style for the Pittsburgh native to pursue. Enka's fan based comes generally from an older generation and is practically unknown outside of Japan, with simple song themes about love and loss. But Jero, real name Jerome White, with his youth, hip-hop look and fine singing voice has propelled enka into the 21st century and captured a new audience. It was the influence of his Japanese grandmother that first led him on the path to enka. She ensured that Jero was aware of his connection to the culture of Japan and sang enka songs in Japanese with him when he was young. He went on to study Japanese at high school and spent time in Japan while on an exchange with the University of Pittsburgh. After he graduated he moved to Japan, working as a computer scientist and teaching English. His big break came when he appeared on an amateur singer TV show. On the back of that success he released his first single in early 2008, promoting it with live appearances in record stores and the odd impromptu street performances. It shot up the Japanese singles chart, reaching No 4, the highest ever position for a first time enka release. Watch the show on CNN as we spend time with him in a karaoke spot in Tokyo and find out how he's dealing with sudden fame in a foreign country.","Jero has made traditional Japanese enka songs hip and found new audience .

"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) -- Detective Steve Watts is locking up another accused pain pill addict. But he's seen this suspect before. She's back in handcuffs for the second time in less than a week. The charge this time, like it was just four days ago, is fraudulently obtaining prescription medication. For Watts and the other detectives of the Louisville Police Department Prescription Drug Diversion Squad, it will be one of 500 to 600 arrests they make each year. Even with arrests nearly every day, ""We're just scratching the surface,"" according to Watts. The number of investigations the unit initiates is up 148 percent compared with a year ago. It can be surprisingly easy to get prescription narcotics that are highly addictive, and they're highly profitable on the street. But detectives in Louisville say most of the people they arrest aren't in it for the money. Instead, they get pills to support their own habit, and police say they have a variety of methods for feeding their addiction. A former nurse will use her medical training to impersonate a doctor to call in fake prescriptions to a pharmacy and simply go in and pick up her drug of choice. Others use prescription pads stolen from physicians or ""doctor shop"" by getting legitimate prescriptions from multiple doctors who are unaware of what other drugs their patients are already taking. Watts sees his job as giving those he arrests a wake-up call. ""If I can make this the worst day of her life so that tomorrow she will seek treatment, then I've won,"" he said. Kentucky is among the top states in the country for prescription pill abuse, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. ""People think that, well, it's authorized by my doctor, we can pick it up at any of the local retailers on the corner, and that prescription abuse is not really a problem,"" Watts said. The vast majority of those Watts and his fellow detectives arrest start their addiction with legitimate needs for pain medication from something such as a car accident. But then they can't stop. That's what worries physicians such as Dr. David Greene. ""We know that narcotics are potentially addictive -- we don't know who might become addicted and who might not,"" he said. Greene practices in eastern Kentucky, where he says prescription pill abuse is rampant. ""It's come to the point where there are few people who don't have someone in their family or know someone who's had problems with addiction, overdose or abuse,"" Greene said. When patients come looking for a prescription for powerful pain medication, doctors like him are forced to determine whether the need is real or whether the patient might be an addict. ""There's no test for pain,"" Greene said. ""The only thing we have to go on is what they tell us, and I generally believe my patients. But most people who are going to lie to you are much better liars than you are at detecting."" One of those patients who Greene says fooled him was a 79-year-old grandmother who was selling her pills out of her nursing home. If the patient is an addict, doctors refuse them at their own peril. In December, a man came into Dr. Dennis Sandlin's rural clinic in Perry County, Kentucky, looking for a prescription. Sandlin demanded that he take a urinalysis test to check for drugs in his system. Later that morning, the patient returned and shot and killed Sandlin. ""My dad was writing in a chart at the nurse's station. Someone heard my dad say, 'You don't want to do this. I take care of a lot of elderly people.' And he said, 'well you didn't help me' and that's when he shot him,"" Sandlin's daughter Danielle said. Danielle is now working to raise awareness of the dilemma doctors face in prescribing pain medication. Her father, she said, was rigorous about prescribing pain medication. ""He would drug test the pope if he came in asking for something."" Greene has encountered intimidating patients in his clinic as well. ""Physical violence is a real fear. We have people who come in who are threatening and abusive,"" he said. After having one patient impersonate him, Greene no longer calls in controlled substances prescriptions into local pharmacies. Some doctors, fearing either physical violence or contributing to addiction, have stopped prescribing pain medication altogether. That puts doctors such as Greene, who do prescribe, in a difficult position. ""No matter what you do, you're going to have an unintended consequence,"" Greene said. ""If you refuse to prescribe, you'll end up with people suffering. And if you do prescribe, you'll find patients diverting them, selling them, using them for recreation."" The solutions, police and doctors say, range from electronic prescriptions that would be difficult to forge to a national prescription database that would allow doctors to see what other drugs a pill-seeking patient is already taking. Danielle Sandlin is pushing for some kind of reform in the wake of her father's death. ""He lost his life for something as silly as a pill.""","Louisville Police's drug squad arrests 500-600 people annually .

"EL PASO, Texas (CNN) -- El Paso native Maria Ruiz knows firsthand how different life can be a mere 30-minute drive south of her Texas home. The sight of families living in homes made of wooden pallets pushed Maria Ruiz into action. ""Just by crossing the border, you're in a Third World country,"" Ruiz said. For 12 years, she's traveled several times a week to the outskirts of Juarez, Mexico, bringing aid to hundreds of impoverished children and their families. Ruiz's family has roots in Juarez, but it wasn't until 1996 that she ventured outside the city. There, for the first time, she saw poverty in the extreme. People lived in homes made of wooden pallets. The elementary school was built of makeshift materials and had no running water or electricity. Teachers told her that many children were failing because they were hungry. ""My heart went out to those kids,"" Ruiz recalled. ""I couldn't just cross my arms and turn away from it. I needed to do something."" Ruiz got donations from El Paso businesses, and within one week, she was running a food program out of her home. She cooked meals in her kitchen and drove the food south to the Juarez school. She fed approximately 1,200 children every day for three and a half years, until the businesses she depended on for donations shut down in 1999. But that didn't stop Ruiz from helping the children in Juarez. Now, working with her husband and two children, she gathers donations from around El Paso -- food, clothing, toys, even furniture -- and distributes them at local ""giveaways"" a couple of times a month. This is no easy task. The Mexican government charges customs fees when large amounts of goods are brought across the border. To avoid this, Ruiz makes several trips every week. ""You bring the stuff little by little, like the ants,"" she said. Although the trip south can be just 30 minutes, long lines coming back into the U.S. mean the return trip can take a couple of hours. On top of that, Juarez is at the center of a drug war, so Ruiz needs to take precautions to ensure her safety. But for her, helping kids in need is worth the effort.  Watch Ruiz describe why she takes risks to help kids » . ""When you make a child smile,"" she said, ""it's awesome."" Although conditions have improved, most families that Ruiz helps still live in poverty, so the Ruiz family has plans to do even more. They're building a community kitchen with space to feed 500, an orphanage for 100 residents and a trade school. They work on the complex every weekend, and although there's more to do, they're hoping to be open this summer. The very thought of seeing the orphanage up and running makes Ruiz smile.  Watch Ruiz describe how she's helping turn a hill into a haven » . ""It'll be a dream come true when it happens,"" she said. ""I pray that it is soon."" Strong religious beliefs help keep Ruiz motivated, and her family's efforts are part of their ministry, called JEM (Jesus es Mana) Ministries. Their Juarez complex even includes a small sanctuary where her husband preaches every Sunday. But Ruiz stresses that they're happy to help anyone, regardless of their beliefs. ""We are open to the community as a whole,"" she said. ""It's equal for everybody.""  Watch Ruiz talk about bringing aid across the border » .

"(CNN) -- Anna Tsuchiya is one of Japan's most recognized young stars. Model, mother, actress and singer: Tsuchiya is living her life her own way. Born in Tokyo in 1984 to a Japanese mother and an American father, as a teenager, Anna started modeling, gracing the pages of fashion magazines. That later led to an acting career, starring in such movies as ""Kamikaze Girls"" and ""Sakuran."" Taking on non-traditional female roles is something Tsuchiya enjoys, as mush because it fits in with here own self image as a bit of an outsider. ""It's fun to act that kind of character who is said by others to be a 'bad girl' but in fact she has a good heart, and that fits me,"" she told CNN's Kyung Lah. ""It would be good if many people could establish good relations in their dealings with others by pure and genuine relations rather than what is on the surface. That is the reason I am fond of acting such characters."" More recently, Anna been taking to the stage, as a punk rock singer. ""My music might have an image of  being 'hard' but in fact it expresses human emotions. So it is different from the surface image and it expresses deeper messages which have emerged from inside, "" she said. With her twin career as actress and singer, she has become something of a role model for young Japanese, especially as her life and work are far removed from the traditional role for Japanese women. ""There is an image of women by which someone dictates how it should be. Nobody could say 'yes' to that image as the right model. We only get one life. I am a woman but I am doing and want to do things that I feel are cool,"" she told CNN. Since becoming a mother three years ago, Tsuchiya has developed a more mature attitude to life: ""What has changed very much is that I before I had my baby I lived just for myself. But now the child is more important than myself."" Her more sanguine attitude was compounded by tragedy when her ex-husband died in May 2008. ""Death is a sad thing but it has to happen and time can never be reversed. I happen to think that when I die I don't want to see people around weeping forever. I think he would have felt the same way,"" she told CNN. ""So if I had been caught up with sorrow he would have been upset. Rather than being overcome, I say I accept the reality."" Despite the setback and tragedies, with Tsuchiya's unique career in the ascendancy, her future looks bright.","Anna Tsuchiya is one of Japan's most recognizable actresses and singers .

"(CNN) -- ""Sometimes you can forget about the preciousness of life,"" hospital spokesman Allen Poston thumbed onto his Blackberry after peering into an operating room where a team of 15 doctors and medical staff separated conjoined twins in six hours in surgery. Two-month-old twins Preslee and Kylee Wells required surgical separation. ""I'm standing here in the operating room looking at the exposed beating heart of Preslee Wells,"" he wrote as he walked the halls at the Children's Hospital of Oklahoma University Medical Center. On Monday afternoon, 2-month-old Preslee and her conjoined sister, Kylee, rolled onto their own backs for the first time, he said. Poston, who updated friends and relatives on the surgery with constant posts from his hospital blog, snapped photos of each girl and showed them to friends and family who had been in the hospital waiting room since early Monday. The news of the operation's success prompted a gush of emotion, breaking the silence that had once filled the room, Poston said. After two months of waiting, the two girls were surgically separated. ""We waited because we wanted the organs to get a little bigger, a little stronger,"" Poston had told CNN over the phone earlier Monday. ""The primary concern was cardiac connection."" After cardiac imaging, doctors determined there was ""very little [cardiac] connection,"" but they remained concerned about a ""liver bridge"" connecting the twins. That bridge, Poston said, posed the greatest operational risk because of its dual use by the twins. Born October 25 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Stevie Stewart and Kylie Wells, the twins are being monitored in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. They are listed in critical condition. ""Today, they leave the OR in two different cribs, one following the other, still close in proximity, but might as well have been a mile apart,"" Poston wrote. ""And that is exactly what everybody was hoping for.""","2-month-old Preslee and her conjoined sister, Kylee, were in surgery for 6 hours .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It may look like an air mattress you might see lying around next to a swimming pool but in reality its function couldn't be less trivial. The Solar Water Disinfecting Tarpaulin could play a major role in saving lives in the developing world. The Solar Water Disinfecting Tarpaulin (SWDT) -- a new portable water purifier -- could be a major step forward in the fight against disease and mortality in the Third World. Eric Olsen, a San Francisco-based architect and the inventor of the SWDT believes the product could help eradicate the scourge of polluted water which the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate claims over 1.5 million lives every year. Not only does it purify water -- up to 20 liters -- it makes it more portable in large quantities -- a vital dual role in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Central Asia where access to clean water is often scarce. ""There are lots of products that do one or the other,"" Olsen told CNN. ""There's a really interesting product that's been around for 10 or 12 years called the Hippo Water Roller -- a 20 gallon drum with a handle attached that allows people -- mostly women -- to transport a week's worth of water back home"". Olsen also points to another product developed by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) that has successfully tackled water impurities. According to Eawag SODIS (Solar Water Disinfection Process) is already used by more than two million in over 30 countries. ""The idea of SWDT,"" he says, ""is to combine these two products and make them into something that can do both roles effectively"". Made out of a top layer of recycled low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and a bottom layer of durable rubberized nylon, the SWDT is both flexible and robust. Its design was morphologically inspired by the saguaro cactus and is adaptable to a variety of situations -- as a wrap to carry or placed on the roof of a mud hut -- and is easy to store. The SWDT uses passive solar radiation -- a water sterilizing method approved by WHO -- which disrupts the reproduction of microorganisms. Heat and UVA radiation from the sun pass through the LDPE layer and into the water cavity and are reflected back by the bottom layer of nylon. On a sunny day purification takes five hours. Olsen admits that its performance is hampered by its low density -- scratches to the surface mean it doesn't transmit the sun's rays as effectively -- but he is confident that this can be overcome with more research. Production using a Radio Frequency Welding equipment may be relatively expensive but Olsen says that the raw materials are cheap and the labor is inexpensive. ""We are trying to imagine ways that this thing can be made and repaired by people where it is most needed,"" he said. ""We are working on a sheet welding process which is much lower tech, inexpensive and also capitalizes on the handcraft skills of local people"". What started out as a solo effort a little over a year ago has gradually grown into a collaborative project. Olsen's students at the California College of Arts, where he currently teaches -- he moves to a new post at Woodbury University this fall -- have lent their enthusiasm and experts from the bioscience and textile industries are increasingly coming on board. Olsen's efforts have already been recognized. The SWDT won first prize in the 2008 Next Generation Design Competition run by Metropolis Magazine -- netting him $10,000 -- and he is waiting for conformation that the invention has been selected for Wired Magazine's Next Fest show which takes place in Chicago later this year. So what next for Olsen and his invention? The aim is to adapt the original design and turn it from a water carrying wrap into a fully fledged coat and he's also looking at ways the material might be redrawn as a tent. He's currently in the process of trying to qualify for non-profit status. And with the likes of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other institutions out there, he thinks the prospects for funding development and deployment look promising.","The Solar Water Disinfecting Tarpaulin aims to reduces disease and death .

"(CNN) -- A middle-of-the-night fight, a surprise pullout from the Grammy Awards, leaked photos, a police investigation -- new pieces of the puzzle of the alleged assault of pop singer Rihanna by her boyfriend Chris Brown have been emerging since early February. Singers Rihanna and Chris Brown, shown performing in December, are rumored to be back together. Then, nearly three weeks after the alleged battery, the couple was reportedly together again. The reconciliation was reported just days before Brown's arraignment, which is expected Thursday in Los Angeles, California. Update: Chris Brown charged with two felonies . Brown, 19, has issued an apology for ""what transpired"" but neither he nor Rihanna, who just turned 21, has directly addressed the allegations. Many would ask why anyone would return to an abusive partner after leaving, but therapists who treat both abusers and victims say it's common. The effect is like a ""pendulum of pain,"" said Steven Stosny, counselor and founder of the anger and violence management program CompassionPower, which treats people convicted of abuse in the home. Abuse victims will ""leave out of either fear, anger or resentment,"" he said. ""But then, after the fear, anger or resentment begins to subside, they feel guilt, shame, anxiety, and that takes them back."" After a violent incident, there is often a ""honeymoon period"" during which the abuser may apologize profusely, give the victim gifts and persuade the victim to stay, experts say. But when that period is over, the abuser may once again become violent. Blog: The tangles of domestic abuse . The reasons for returning to an abusive partner may relate to the days of early humans, who had to fend for themselves in the wild. The powerful psychological mechanisms that lead people to stay in abusive relationships may have developed for survival reasons, Stosny said. ""To leave an attachment relationship -- a relationship where there's an emotional bond -- meant certain death by starvation or saber-tooth tiger,""  he said. Abuse happens in both low-income and high-income couples, said Joanna Snawder, who counsels students and community members at the Metropolitan State College of Denver in Colorado. A wealthy woman who has never worked may not want to change her lifestyle, while a poor woman may be financially dependent on her boyfriend or husband. Regardless, women may not want to break off an abusive relationship because they are afraid to be independent, don't know how to take care of themselves or don't want to face shame from friends and family, she said. Sometimes the abuser can get his partner to stay with him through manipulation, for instance, telling a woman that he will kill himself if she leaves him, said Mark Crawford, a clinical psychologist based in Roswell, Georgia. Crawford has seen many women stay in relationships because they couldn't bear the guilt of an outcome such as this. ""There are some women who need to be needed so badly they'll put up with anything,"" Crawford said. ""Even if the guy beats the crap out of them, they just feel that responsible for the other person."" The term ""the cycle of abuse"" is often used to describe how coming from an abusive family is believed to make an individual more likely to be an abuser or to stay in an abusive relationship. ""Unless we do a lot of psychological work, we often repeat family structures and dynamics that seem normal to us,"" Snawder said. On the other hand, some people who grow up in abusive households do not repeat the behavior they saw at home, she said. One student Snawder advises voluntarily went back to her abusive boyfriend after having a restraining order placed against him. They are together, but the man is assaulting the young woman again. ""It's really important that a woman reach out and get support from friends, family or a counselor who can help her see that she doesn't have to go back to that relationship,"" she said. Men aren't always the abusers. There are relationships in which the woman is the abuser and the man is the victim, and all of the behavioral patterns happen in reverse. For instance, the woman makes the man feel like it's his fault for being beaten, Crawford said. ""Those men just don't have the sense of self to say 'This is not acceptable,'"" he said. Stosny's celebrity clients who have been abusive to their romantic partners may have been negatively affected by their rise to fame early in life, he said. They see themselves as above others, and feel they are entitled to punch someone whenever they feel like it. ""I had one professional basketball player who sexually assaulted a girl. He really in his heart didn't believe that she didn't want to have sex with him,"" Stosny said. Can there ever be a happy ending for an abusive relationship? Experts agree that it's unusual, but a relationship in which a partner has been violent can become healthy again if, and only if, the abusive person seeks counseling to change his or her mindset. ""If you don't believe that you have a problem, and you believe the person drove you to it, you're going to have a really hard time seeing that you have a problem,"" Snawder said. In practice, however, the victim usually just needs to move on to someone else, she said.","Chris Brown and Rihanna are reportedly back together despite rumors he beat her .

"(Health.com) -- More than one in 10 women develops depression during pregnancy. Now, a new study suggests that women who are treated with antidepressants are more likely to give birth early or to have newborns that need to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit. Babies of women taking SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to have been admitted to intensive care. Depression itself can have ill effects for both mom and baby. Therefore, the benefits of the antidepressants -- known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors -- may still outweigh the risks for some women, researchers say. ""There is no easy way out of this,"" says Dr. Tim Oberlander, a developmental pediatrician at BC Children's Hospital, in Vancouver, Canada, who has studied the effects of SSRIs on children exposed in the womb, but was not involved in the current study. ""Depression needs to be managed, and for some women, the use of these medications is appropriate and necessary."" Health.com: 3 Signs you should stop, adjust, or switch antidepressants . The new study, led by Dr. Najaaraq Lund, of Aarhus University, in Denmark, found that babies whose mothers had taken SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to require treatment in an NICU. Women have been using SSRIs during pregnancy since the early 1990s, Lund and her colleagues point out in the report, which is published in the October issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. These drugs, which include Zoloft, Prozac, and others, are widely considered to be the safest type of antidepressant medication to take during pregnancy. It's been difficult to confirm their safety, however, especially since investigators have to find a way to distinguish between the effects of depression itself -- and habits that depressed women may be more likely to engage in, like drinking and smoking -- and the drug on the newborn. Health.com: Do pregnancy and bipolar disorder mix? Lund and her colleagues tackled this issue by including a group of women who reported a history of some type of psychiatric illness but weren't taking SSRIs. Some, but not all, of these women had suffered from depression. ""Using this group as a comparison group takes into account possible genetic or lifestyle factors associated with present or previous psychiatric disorders,"" the researcher notes. The analysis included 329 women who took SSRIs in pregnancy, 4,902 with a history of psychiatric illness who weren't taking the drugs, and 51,770 women who reported no history of psychiatric illness and weren't taking SSRIs. All had received prenatal care at Aarhus University Hospital between 1989 and 2006. Babies of women taking SSRIs were born an average of five days earlier than those born to women who had no mental illness, and were twice as likely to be born preterm. The babies whose mothers took SSRIs were 2.4 times as likely to have been admitted to the NICU than infants who hadn't been exposed to the drugs in utero. They were also more than four times as likely to have Apgar scores below eight, just five minutes after birth. (Apgar scores measure an infant's health at birth by looking at his or her breathing, heartbeat, reflexes, muscle tone, and skin color; scores of seven and above are considered normal, and a newborn's Apgar score has no influence on how he or she will fare later in life.) There was no difference between SSRI-exposed babies and unexposed babies in head circumference or birth weight. Antidepressant medication is just one part of the equation in addressing women's mental health during pregnancy, notes Oberlander, who says depression in pregnancy is a ""huge public health issue"" with lasting implications for women and their children. Helping ensure that women are getting enough social support and adequate nutrition is essential, he adds, while alternative treatments for depression -- such as exercise, light therapy, and omega-3 fatty acids -- ought to be explored further. ""In general, optimizing non-pharmacological treatment would be a really important step,"" he says. He explains that it is essential to follow SSRI-exposed babies as they grow up, to identify any problems and intervene as necessary. However, he and Lund agree that it's still unclear whether the differences seen at birth will have lasting effects on a child's development and health. Health.com: 6 Rules for a healthy postpartum slim-down . ""As depression itself can influence birth outcome in a negative direction, treatment is warranted in some cases based on the existing body of evidence,"" Lund says. ""In cases with mild or moderate symptoms, psychotherapy can be used as an alternative treatment. In severe cases and in patients with a history of recurrent, severe depression, continuation or initiation of treatment might be the best option. ""Every single case should be considered individually, and the decision should be made by the woman and her ob-gyn and psychiatrist,"" she says.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Sim Van der Ryn has been a leader in sustainable architecture for over 40 years. As well as creating a portfolio of inspiring green designs -- notably the 1977 Bateson Building in Sacramento -- he is also a teacher and an author. His most recent book ""Design for Life"" traces his ancestral and ecological design roots. Principal Voices talked to Van der Ryn about the passion which continues to consume his life. Sim Van der Ryn has dedicated his working life to integrating nature's principals into his designs. CNN: What inspired you to become an architect? Sim Van der Ryn: Probably was when I was 14, I worked out on a farm helping a handyman build a Cape Cod cottage from a set of ten dollar magazine plans. I just thought the whole process of translating from a two-dimensional set of drawings to a three-dimensional reality was exciting. CNN: At that time, was there anything that you were interested in pursuing? SVdR: Let's see. I had a tendency towards art -- painting, drawing and sculpture. But my parents were really practical and told me that wasn't a suitable profession! CNN: Was ecological architecture always something you wanted to pursue? SVdR: My first interest was really in what we called Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE). I was interested in the social side of architecture, because it seemed to me that you read architectural criticism and, you know, there was no criteria other than subjective, especially when you consider how a building works for people. I helped found POE which never really went very far. Later on I was the Chief Architect for the State of California and I had money to do that [POE] but none of my client agencies wanted to do that. CNN: What is/was POE? SVdR: There is an international association called the Environmental Design Research Association which kind of grew out of POE. I started it together with this English woman called Clare Cooper Marcus who was teaching at Berkeley [University of California]. She did an evaluation of public housing projects. And at the same time a fellow called Oscar Newman wrote a book called ""Defensible Space"", which was an attack on what was then the standard -- Corbu [Le Corbusier], high rise public housing -- which turned out to actually dynamite a number of projects in this country -- in Chicago, St Louis. CNN: When you were starting out who did you look up to in the architectural world? SVdR: The biggest influence on me was Buckminster Fuller who was a peripatetic character who would show up at schools. He really provided a larger vision that was far more than just designing a building. And that for me was the kind of Satori moment -- learning from him that the issue was much larger than the building. I never forgot that. He was thinking in ""whole systems"" terms and I have been ever since. And then my work was always involved in socially orientated architecture -- when we still cared about that in this country. I worked on migrant farm labor housing, I built a lot of prefab systems based on Fuller's work. I was a refugee from Holland and as I say in my book [Design for Life] I found who I was just kind of being in the leftover pieces of nature that were in New York city -- during the war construction stopped. So that was a huge influence in shaping my life. I lived in New York but I left as soon as I could. I really not much of an urbanist. I believe in cities, but basically, my work isn't very urban. I like to build in places where nature is. CNN: After the 1973 oil crisis did you notice a change in mood? Wasn't there more of a push towards sustainable architecture during that period? SVdR: No, that wasn't really true of most places. I was fortunate to hook up with Jerry Brown. He liked the outsiders. His great genius, when he was Governor [of California], was bringing all these outsiders to run these agencies that had always been run by insiders. That was a great gift. The oil embargo of 1973 did wake some people up. [President] Carter got it but wasn't able to sell it. We did have some federal initiatives and in California we have some very strong state initiatives that I'm proud to say that I had a role in creating. That did make a huge difference. But then of course Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 and we just went to sleep for the next twenty-eight years. CNN: Of all the buildings you've created, do you have a favorite? SVdR: Some of them are very process related. The early work where I had this class in 1971 and we built this little village out of reclaimed materials. That was a huge huge learning experience and that was a kind of a rehearsal for then doing this Farallones Institute -- Integral Urban House at Berkeley -- which Fine Homebuilding magazine called ""the birth of green"", which was a nice thing to say because it wasn't particularly pretty! We were just fooling around, figuring stuff out. So those are some of the process/learning projects. Of that early period I think the Bateson Building has held up really well for 30 years. It created quite a bit of change and awareness in the building and architectural community. The fact that you could reduce energy consumption not just by 40 percent -- which was mandated by the laws we passed -- but by 80 percent. That's a landmark favorite for me. Of a recent one, I would say the Kirsch Center [for Environmental Studies]. Another is the Solar Living Center in Hopland. I talk about second generation ecological design where we have a much higher level of integration. A lot of the first experiments were just trying to maximize one thing like the sun and then the more we learned we realized we could integrate everything. In terms of experimentation, craftsmanship and beauty the Klein house [more commonly known as The Guitar House] is a kind of favorite. We worked on it for five or six years. I think of it as an experimental project because it's crazy in terms of four people living in that much space, but just in terms of an exercise and working with new materials like rammed earth it is quite beautiful. CNN: Are you still teaching? SVdR: No, I have no formal associations with an institution. That part of my life is over. CNN: But students must contact you all the time wanting advice though. What do you tell them? SVdR: Well, I have an association with down in Arizona called the Eco-Institute. I go there once or twice a year. It's good because it's a community -- 15-20 students -- who work on real projects. I tell them to go there. CNN: What's your view on architecture education being taught now? SVdR: I think that architectural education is pretty broken in terms of what we need to be dealing with today. They may have a few courses on sustainability, one or two people on a faculty in a large school who care about this stuff, but they are marginalized. CNN: Who, out of the current crop of big name architects, do you admire? SVdR: Of the British, Norman Foster... CNN: Richard Rogers? SVdR: And Rogers. I think they're both really good most of the time. I like Frank Gehry because I think he's a real person. He's made huge breakthroughs in terms of using computers to design complex surfaces. CNN: Calatrava? SVdR: Incredible. Maybe more as an engineer than an architect. I like the people who are organic and he's actually very organic particularly as an engineer. The architecture maybe a little less so. He did this bridge [Sundial Bridge] up in northern California. I think his bridges are remarkable. People like Cameron Sinclair, I really admire what he is doing. If I were 40 years younger I'd be doing that. And also Ken Yeang. I think he's good because of anyone doing larger buildings he's one of the ecological pioneers who's really thinking about them in a climatic sense. There are a lot of good architects who don't ever get a lot of attention. But, you know, architecture still operates with this fountainhead mystique which is such garbage. CNN: How do your methods of engagement with a project differ from the ""normal"" processes an architect would go through? SVdR: I focus a lot on process and on collaboration. We don't try and sell anybody anything. I spend more time interviewing clients than I do trying to sell them something. I'm not sure what the normal architectural process is, but currently it's bureaucratic. It's all governed by metrics. What it seldom gets at is; what are your aspirations? What are you trying to do? The real questions don't get answered very much. Now we have LEED and that's become the new excuse not to think. And it's not that it is bad. It is an incremental improvement but given what's happening on the planet right now it's not enough. And the sad thing is that we've wasted 30 years. We're gonna pay big time for that. Maybe we can play catch up but it's going to take a huge shift.","Pioneer of sustainable architecture Sim Van der Ryn talks to CNN about his work .

"(CNN) -- The most notable women in technology probably don't spend all day thinking about hairstyles and dinner parties. But according to a bright pink infographic making its way around the web, you can tell a lot about some of the world's most tech-savvy women based on their hairdos and extracurriculars. In hopes of inspiring people, Wpromote, a search-engine marketing firm located south of Los Angeles, created ""Which Female Tech Influencer Are You?"" -- an infographic reminiscent of a teen magazine quiz. The flow chart comes complete with arrows, cartoons and five possible answers in the form of female tech influencers. The women? Marissa Mayer, Google VP; Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook; Natalie Massenet, Net-A-Porter.com founder; Caroline McCarthy, CNET.com journalist and Sarah Evans, a public-relations professional. ""They are all unique,"" Maria Sass of Wpromote wrote. ""However, they all share one common theme: they inspire women at Wpromote on a daily basis and hopefully now they can inspire you, too."" The infographic, which was created in response the lack of female representation in ""The Evolution of the Geek"" -- a flowchart that was passed around the web last year -- caught some flak from sites like TechCrunch and ComputerWeekly.com. ""Female success has been reduced to a series of key decisions concerning shoes ... and white wine spritzers,"" Jenny Williams of ComputerWeekly.com wrote. But Sarah Evans, ""PR pro and Twitter sweetheart,"" as the infographic calls her, says the quiz is doing exactly what it's supposed to do -- getting our attention. It's light-hearted and brings visibility to women in technology, Evans told CNN. ""If women are a little turned off by it, that's awesome,"" she added. ""Create your own. Offer up another discussion."" Though Evans ended up picking herself the one time she took the quiz, she said, ""I can see how easy it is not to."" One of the final questions asks, ""Who is your dream man?"" The last option, ""Chicago Cubs fan,"" points directly to Evans, who, ironically, supports the rival St. Louis Cardinals. But, other than that, she said, it's obvious the creators ""pay attention to what I do.""

"(CNN) -- The death of Mark Madoff, the son of convicted Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff, was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner's officer on Sunday, a day after the victim's body was discovered hanging from a ceiling pipe in his SoHo apartment. Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner, said the autopsy was completed around 1 p.m. Sunday. Borakove said medical examiners will conduct toxicology and tissue tests on the body. The result, she said, will not be made public unless Madoff's next of kin asks for the case file. Madoff killed himself two years to the day after his father was arrested for swindling $50 billion from investors in the largest Ponzi-scheme in U.S. history. None of Madoff's immediate family members have commented on his death. However, the attorney who represents the victim's mother, Ruth, said she ""is heartbroken."" The attorney, Peter Chavkin, responded by e-mail and said Ruth Madoff would not provide additional information. Mark Madoff killed himself while his wife was out of town and his 2-year-old son was asleep in a nearby bedroom, early Saturday morning, authorities said. Madoff's body, fully clothed and hanging from a living room pipe, was discovered by his father-in-law around 7:30 a.m. The boy was not harmed. Mark Madoff's attorney, Martin Flumenbaum, on Saturday called his client's death. ""a terrible and unnecessary tragedy."" ""Mark was an innocent victim of his father's monstrous crime who succumbed to two years of unrelenting pressure from false accusations and innuendo,"" Flumenbaum said. ""We are all deeply saddened by this shocking turn of events."" Bernard Madoff is currently serving a 150-year prison sentence for masterminding the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. Madoff bilked investors out of $50 billion by masquerading his investment firm as legitimate when it was nothing more than a front. He used funds from new investors to send payments to his earlier investors, falsely portraying them as proceeds from investments, when they were actually stolen money, prosecutors said. The 71-year-old Madoff pleaded guilty to the charges in 2009 and is now incarcerated at the Butner Federal Correction Complex, a medium-security prison in eastern North Carolina. Bernard Madoff's criminal activities have spawned a tidal wave of civil actions against Mark Madoff, his mother, siblings and hundreds of other defendants, accused of profiting off the Ponzi scheme by withdrawing more money from Madoff's fund than they invested, money they presumably thought was investment income. A person familiar with the Madoffs says Mark Madoff has not been in touch with his extended family for the past two years. Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee in charge of recovering and distributing Madoff's assets, has filed a slew of lawsuits in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan over the past week on behalf of some of Madoff's victims. One filed on December 8 named Mark Madoff -- as well as his brother Andrew Madoff and uncle Peter Madoff -- as one of several defendants in a civil lawsuit. On Saturday, Picard issued a brief statement expressing his condolences. ""This is a tragic development, and my sympathy goes out to Mark Madoff's family,"" he said. The other defendants include JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, UBS, an Austrian banker, and two accountants who are accused of knowing about the fraud but covering it up and profiting from it. The majority of Madoff's victims did not invest directly in his firm. They invested in third-party feeder funds, and therefore don't qualify for the financial protections extended to direct investors. So far, 16,394 claims have been filed by investors who say they lost money. The majority of the claims -- 13,054, or nearly 80% of the total -- have been denied, because the investors were invested through feeder funds.

"Adults who were exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke during childhood have lungs that look different on CT scans from those of people who grew up in a smoke-free environment, a new study suggests. The harmful short-term effects of secondhand smoke are well known; the long-term consequences aren't as clear. Specifically, their lungs have slightly more, and larger, emphysema-like ""holes"" than those with less smoke exposure, says Gina Lovasi, M.P.H., Ph.D., of Columbia University, and her colleagues. Although breathing tests showed that the smoke-exposed lungs were functioning just fine, Lovasi said the changes could signal an increased vulnerability to developing emphysema and other lung problems down the road. Health.com: Should smoking around kids be illegal? Emphysema is a progressive lung disease characterized by shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and weight loss. About 24 million people in the United States have emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis, which together are known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however about half of those people don't realize they have COPD. The lung condition is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States, and smoking is a major cause of COPD. Health.com: I'm a nonsmoker, but I have emphysema due to a rare genetic condition . ""The interesting part about this is that we don't know a lot about how the lungs change over time and whether they heal completely after being exposed to tobacco,"" says Lovasi, who is scheduled to present her findings on Tuesday at the American Thoracic Society's 105th International Conference in San Diego. ""We can still see a difference even decades later."" The harmful short-term effects of breathing other people's cigarette smoke are well known, but the long-term consequences aren't as clear. To investigate, Lovasi and her team looked at CT scans of the lungs of 1,781 nonsmoking 45- to 84-year-olds taking part in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) trial. Health.com: 5 celebrities who had -- or are at risk of -- the lung disease COPD . About half of the study participants said that no one with whom they lived  during childhood smoked cigarettes at home, 31 percent lived with one person who smoked at home, and 17 percent lived with two or more smokers. Lovasi and her team checked the lung CT scans for large areas where the density was similar to air (lung tissue is naturally denser than air), and also calculated what percentage of their lungs was made up of these ""holes."" Health.com: My smoker's cough turned out to be emphysema . ""The lungs are supposed to have air in them, but it's important that the air is interspersed with blood vessels so that we can get the oxygen out of the air,"" she says. ""Small holes can expand over time and merge to form larger holes."" For people who hadn't grown up with smokers, 17 percent of their lung tissue had this air-like density, while ""holes"" made up 20 percent of the lung area of people who had lived with at least two smokers during childhood. The more heavily smoke-exposed study participants also had more relatively large holes in their lungs. In comparison, ""someone with emphysema would typically have between 30 percent and 60 percent of the lungs classified as air-like (or emphysema-like) using the threshold we used for our study,"" says Lovasi. Health.com: 1 in 3 smokers would kick habit to protect pet .

"(CNN) -- Christina Pearson was half-bald at age 13. She just couldn't stop pulling her hair, and ended up taking out every lock from the tops of her ears to the crown of her head. Trichotillomania is such a stigmatizing disorder that people will go to great length to hide it, experts say. ""It was absolutely terrifying because I was a very bright child, and doing great in school,"" she said. ""The doctor had no idea what it was."" Pearson continued pulling her hair throughout her teens, 20s, and early 30s. It wasn't until she was 33 that she learned her condition had a name: trichotillomania. She became inspired to start an organization, called the Trichotillomania Learning Center, to help other sufferers of the disorder. It turns out that this condition, characterized by the urge to pull hair from one's body, affects about 2 to 4 percent of the population, according to the Trichotillomania Learning Center. A new study published this week in the Archives of General Psychiatry may hold promise for those who compulsively pull their hair. Researchers say participants who took an antioxidant called N-acetylcysteine, sold over the counter at vitamin stores, had significant improvement over patients who took placebos. The dietary supplement used in the study is known for its benefits to the kidneys and liver, said lead author Dr. John Grant at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, who is on the advisory board of the Trichotillomania Learning Center. More recently it has been shown to affect glutamate, a chemical messenger in the brain that seems to be involved in compulsive repetitive behaviors, he said. The sample size was small -- 50 people -- but the study has generated enthusiasm among trichotillomania researchers. ""This is one of the bigger advances we've had within this field in a long time,"" said Doug Woods, associate professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Psychologists are still debating how to categorize trichotillomania, Woods said. Many believe it is related to obsessive compulsive disorder, but others liken it to addictions or impulse control disorders. Researchers are unsure of exactly what goes on in the brain with this disorder. Some people with trichotillomania feel pleasure in pulling hair, while others describe it as ""calming,"" and still others have no idea why they do it, Grant said. There may be differences in the brain pathways among people with the condition, he said. For Pearson, pulling hair up made her feel as if her whole nervous system lit up, she said. ""Basically my fingers would search for a texture, a certain type of hair, when I found it, I would pull it out,"" she said. ""I would feel like I had found gold."" The condition affects primarily women and usually begins in childhood or adolescence, Woods said. The term, coined in 1889 by a Greek physician, comes from the Greek words for its features: ""tricho"" means ""hair,"" ""till"" means ""to pull,"" and ""mania"" means ""frenzy."" Long before the disorder had a name, the idea of compulsive hair-pulling had been known for hundreds of years, Woods said. The two main kinds of medications that have been used for trichotillomania are selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors -- SSRIs, used for depression -- and the OCD drug chlorimipramine, Woods said. The antidepressants may help patients' anxiety and depression but don't actually help the pulling, whereas chlorimipramine has been shown to dampen the pulling impulse somewhat. But the treatment that has demonstrated the most effectiveness so far is behavior therapy, Woods said. The dietary supplement probably will not replace the need for behavioral therapy, but future research may find that they two approaches work well together, Grant said. Before trying N-acetylcysteine, people should consult their physicians, particularly to determine whether there are interactions that the supplement could have with other medications the patient already takes, Grant said. Experts say there are still many people who compulsively pull their hair and don't know that they are not the only ones. Trichotillomania is such a stigmatizing disorder that people will go to great lengths to hide it -- to explain bald spots to acquaintances, some patients will lie and say they had cancer, Woods said. ""I have talked to patients who have pulled for 25 years, and their husbands don't even know it, they hide it so well,"" he said. People with the disorder don't just pull from their heads -- they also pull hair from their eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic regions, Woods said. Living with the disease, Pearson at times felt suicidal. She dropped out of high school because she was terrified of her friends finding out. ""There was a time in my early 20s when I really, seriously considered, could I cut my hands off and live my life?"" she said. ""My hands were my enemies, because they pulled my hair."" To manage her condition 18 years ago, Pearson tried relaxation techniques for the situations that led to her pulling. For example, she tended to pull her hair while driving, so she bought thin leather gloves and told herself that she could not remove them -- or pull her hair -- until she turned the car off. Today, there are many more strategies available to help people identify the triggers for hair-pulling and figure out the best way to control the impulses in those situations, Pearson said. The Trichotillomania Learning Center has assisted more than 100,000 people in some way since 1991, Pearson said. The organization holds conferences, retreats, professional training sessions, and other programs to help people manage the disorder. The center also helps health care professionals learn about treating people for the condition. ""To experience the entrapment of this type of compulsion, and then to experience the freedom of living without it is a gift I wish for everyone,"" Pearson said.

"(CNN) -- It's a snapshot meant to shock: a bloodied woman hunched over with this caption underneath, ""My mother knew I'd never hurt her, then she got in the way."" Graphic ads about the dangers of meth addiction are trying to tackle what's a top drug problem in small towns. The Meth Project has made a name for itself with graphic, disturbing print and broadcast ads meant to wake up kids to the dangers of methamphetamine addiction. Another ad shows a filthy urinal with the caption, ""No one thinks they'll lose their virginity here. Meth will change that."" The nonprofit organization said it's baring the ugly truth about what the Drug Enforcement Administration calls the most dangerous drug problem of small-town America. Now the Meth Project is targeting a new audience: the growing population of Spanish-speaking teens in the Western United States. It's releasing television commercials in Spanish in Arizona and radio ads throughout the West featuring young Latino addicts sharing real-life meth nightmares. Nothing is lost in translation. In Idaho, one of the Spanish radio voices belongs to recovering addict Aucensio Flores. In his ad, Flores said he first tried meth at 15 and headed on a downward spiral, adding: ""I think it affected my brain. I have bad thoughts and I only want to do bad things, such as hurt people. I think I am going crazy."" Flores said meth deadened his conscience, emboldened him and kept him up all night with an edgy high. Meth made it easier, he said, to become sucked into a world of crime and gangs. Flores remembers beating up and robbing people just walking down the street and taking part in drive-by shootings, including one in which ""I shot 17 shots into the house and then I walked around the block and back into the car and just left."" Meth made him feel ""big and bad,"" said Flores, who never imagined being locked up. He's serving time at the Nampa Juvenile Correction Center in Idaho for grand theft, possession of a weapon by a minor, and drug possession. Flores' drug rehabilitation counselor, Colleen Foster, said that up to 40 percent of juveniles in the Nampa facility have a history of meth addiction. She said meth takes over their lives. ""It starts to destroy their value system. It eats away at every aspect of their life: family, responsibility to community, responsibility to education, responsibility to themselves even,"" Foster said. ""It just eats away at all that until they have no value system left, that the only thing they're doing is seeking for that high."" Foster supports the Meth Project's Spanish ad campaign because, she said, denial of the problem extends to teenagers and parents in all populations -- including Latinos. She said she thinks outreach needs to be better tailored for the growing Latino community in Idaho. Foster also counsels Yair Perez, a recovering meth addict who served time for robbery and was released recently from the juvenile detention center. ""When I was coming down from meth, I would feel bad. You know, I threw up and I couldn't eat. Even if I was hungry, I couldn't eat,"" Perez said. ""You know, I would just stay in my room and not talk to anyone, because they would make me mad when they talked to me."" While on meth, Perez said, he also developed frightening ulcerlike sores on his body and suffered from an erratic heartbeat. Still, he said, his cravings for the drug persist and he knows staying clean won't be easy. He's gotten a job at a fast-food restaurant, is reconnecting with his family and has recorded a Spanish radio ad for the Meth Project. Perez said he hopes to reach young Latinos who aren't getting the message about meth in English. ""They might understand a little bit of it or half of it,"" he said.  ""But if they hear it ... in their own language ... the way they were born and they were raised, you know, speaking Spanish, then maybe they will pay a little more attention to it and maybe think about it, instead of doing it."" Idaho Meth Project volunteer Miguel Mouw agrees, saying that ""in the Hispanic community, there's just a lack of education, a lack of treatment and resources, there's a lack of support, because there are some communication gaps."" Mouw, also a recovering meth addict, speaks in classrooms throughout Idaho and at community events. He said he thinks the graphic nature of the ads is needed to drive home the dangers of meth. ""I've seen people lose everything, you know, from their toes to the top of the head, either through death or maybe it's the sores or the scabs [affecting] the teeth or the eyes,"" he said. ""The list is endless. It really is."" Drug officials say meth -- also known as chalk, crank, crystal, glass, ice or speed -- has been a major threat in rural America because it is cheap and easy to make. Traffickers mix drugs bought over the counter with common ingredients, according to the DEA. Twelve- to 14-year-olds who live in small towns are more than twice as likely to use meth than those who live in larger cities, the agency said. The Meth Project began in 2005 in what was then the heartland of meth: Montana. Government leaders there credit the effort with large declines in meth use, including a 45 percent drop in teen use since its ads first appeared. The ad campaign has since spread to a half-dozen other states, including Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois and Wyoming. Program organizers said they research and tailor their campaigns for each new state. But not everyone is convinced of the program's effectiveness. David Erceg-Hurn, a researcher and critic of the Meth Project, said: ""There is the potential for boomerang effects with these ads. Some teenagers react negatively to graphic advertising. These people don't like 'being told how to behave' by the ads and may rebel against them."" The Meth Project is funded through private donations and receives millions of dollars in federal and state grants. Erceg-Hurn said he thinks those dollars could be put to better use. As for the Spanish ad campaign, he said: ""I prefer the radio ads to the print and television ads. They're not so over the top. I like that the radio ads feature real former users rather than actors. This makes them seem more realistic. A problem is still that they don't provide any information about how to quit or avoid using meth. Teenagers need practical skills and information."" The Spanish ad campaign in Idaho is too new for analysis of widespread impact. Organizers said they hope for more reactions such as that of high school student Cindy Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who moved to Idaho from Guatemala, said she and her parents have been listening to the radio ads together. ""My parents, we didn't see a lot of drugs during my time in Guatemala. So we didn't know what the drugs are and what they do,"" she said. ""So what my parents would do, like when they would listen to the radio, they were like, 'Oh, you should listen to this, because this is what I want you to learn.' "" Rodriguez said she was prepared when peers offered her meth. ""They were like, 'Oh, you should do this, so that way you could be a little bit cooler or you're with us. You need to do this.' I'm like, no ... you know, cause I'd heard about it.""","Meth Project has disturbing ads to wake up kids to the dangers of meth .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A third of military children surveyed who have a parent deployed in a war zone are at ""high risk"" for psychological problems, according to a new study by military doctors and researchers. The study concludes there's a greater chance of family problems upon a military parent's return. The study, published in the Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, surveyed military spouses of deployed Army soldiers with school-age children, aged 5 to 12. The questionnaire appraised the strain on the family of dealing with a parent deployed to the war zone. Results found that stress levels were high for children and spouses of deployed troops but also that support networks from military to religious helped mitigate the problems. The number of children found to be high-risk is more than 2½ times the national level and higher than historical military samples. The authors surveyed 101 families in what they said was the first such evaluation since September 11, 2001, and the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Overall, there are more than 2 million U.S. military children, many of whom have parents who have deployed multiple times -- deployments that, for the first time since the Vietnam War, can occur as little as 12 months after returning from a previous deployment. The study focused on families of active-duty soldiers living on base at Fort Lewis, Washington, and is just a ""small snapshot,"" said one of the authors, Col. Beth Ellen Davis. She is the chief of Developmental Services at Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Washington. Davis said that more studies would have to be done to understand the impact on military children in other circumstances, like those with parents in other services, living off-base or in the National Guard, but that the results point to a problem nobody could deny. ""Children struggle when their parents deploy. I don't think anyone will struggle with that,"" Davis said. The survey quantified what Davis had seen anecdotally in her work at the hospital. ""My perception in the school-age range and pre-school-age range was that how the at-home parent is doing is most predictive of how the child is coping,"" Davis said. Almost half of the spouses surveyed were found to have a high level of stress, which the authors say has a significant impact on their child's ability to cope. Parents surveyed said their children experienced a number of symptoms including ""internalizing symptoms"" like anxiety, frequent crying and worrying. Interestingly, it is the return from deployment that is most stressful, according to three-quarters of those surveyed. ""On reunification, there is excitement, anticipation and relief, occasionally followed by emotional conflict as the service member reintegrates back into the family,"" wrote the surveyors. Effects of deployment on families can be seen beyond the Fort Lewis survey. At Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, Gia Ellis' husband is deployed to Afghanistan for the second time. The mother of two said the return home is as stressful as the deployment itself. ""Trying to relinquish some of the responsibilities that we've had to take on and give it back to them,"" Ellis said last month. She was not a participant in the stress survey. ""Letting go is very difficult. Very difficult to share the responsibility with your spouse and, 'Oh, yeah, you're in this family? I forgot.' "" Ellis said that this deployment has been easier on her in part because she is living on the base and has access to a support network of wives and staff. The strain on families during the reintegration has parallels to families with spouses who travel a lot for business, said Frederic Medway, distinguished professor emeritus of psychology at  the University of South Carolina. Medway, who has studied the effects of family integration in military and non-military families, agreed with the new study's conclusion that there is a greater chance of family problems when the spouse comes back. ""That is when the husband and wife actually fight and talk about stuff,"" Medway said. ""The service member comes back and doesn't feel a part of it and returns with his own baggage."" Much work still needs to be done to assess how these psychological effects play out over time, Medway said. His studies on families of the first Gulf War found that reintegration problems played out in a period lasting around six months to year. Medway said that it is hard to compare studies from different wars but that duration does point to a key problem in the current conflicts, since many troops are redeploying after a year, meaning the family never really gets a chance to settle back down. One surprising result of the new study was what factors were predictors of high-risk impact. Parents with a college education were less likely to have children at risk, and younger parents fared worse. Those with college education who were also employed had significantly less stress, which the study authors suggested could be a result of having access to additional support networks, adult interactions and income to relieve stress. Length of deployment, military rank and children's age did not have an impact. Medway said that one reason for the effect of education could be that those in lower social classes tend to deal with more mental health and marital issues in general. ""How far is the rubber band going to stretch?"" Medway asked. Pre-existing problems are compounded by deployment. Davis, co-author of the Fort Lewis-based survey, said that what the study revealed was that those feeling the brunt of the stress were younger families, which are the bulk of enlisted soldiers. ""What comes with enlistment is usually junior-ranking high-school graduates getting by enough to support a family but often times not (to) support child care outside the home,"" Davis explained. That demographic has higher stress because they lack support networks. Davis said the study highlights the need to understand the impact of deployment on these at risk groups and make sure they have the support they need and ""not assuming that everyone has the same needs."" She noted that there are resources for families and that more effort is being made to reach out to those who most need help ""whether they ask for it or not.""","Study: Third of kids with a deployed parent at ""high risk"" for psychological problems .

"About 1 in 7, or 13.5 percent of adults who encountered intense dust clouds after the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11 were later found to have asthma, compared with just 8.4 percent who had no dust cloud exposure, researchers in Atlanta and New York City reported on Tuesday. Among rescue workers, the asthma risk was highest for those who worked on the pile on September 11. Likewise, among various groups of people connected to the Twin Tower collapse, rescue and recovery workers were more likely to have a diagnosis of asthma (12.2 percent) than passers-by (8.4 percent). The results are from a survey, conducted from November 2006 through December 2007, to assess the health status of more than 46,000 adults five to six years after the disaster. Health.com: Bad air day? Here's how to survive . That such a horrific event left lasting physical and emotional scars is, perhaps, no great surprise. Among adults with no prior diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 23.8 percent have reported symptoms after September 11, and the prevalence of symptoms has increased over time, researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The mental health effects, which can be debilitating and often chronic, ""seem to be the largest health problem coming out of 9/11"" says Lorna Thorpe, Ph.D., the deputy commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Division of Epidemiology and one of the coauthors of the study. ""But immediately after the 9/11 event, I don't think there was a clear understanding of what the physical impacts would be."" Health.com: Is your child's asthma under control? Take this test . People in the vicinity of the collapse had ""the potential to inhale huge amounts of particulate matter,"" observes Joan Reibman, M.D., an associate professor of medicine and environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and the director of the school's Bellevue Asthma Center, who was not involved in the study. ""We think that could act as a real irritant to the airways."" Some 23 million Americans have asthma, a lung condition that causes airway swelling and inflammation. People with asthma may experience repeated bouts of coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and tightness in the chest. Anthony M. Szema, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine and surgery and the head of the allergy diagnostic unit at SUNY Stony Brook School of Medicine, has studied the effects of the World Trade Center collapse on children living in Manhattan's Chinatown. His team's most recent study, accepted for publication in Allergy & Asthma Proceedings, will show that the rate of asthma at the closest elementary school to the World Trade Center (29 percent) is high compared with the rate of asthma in children in the general population. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 9.3 percent of U.S. children have asthma. ""[The new study] is entirely congruous with our findings,"" he says. Health.com: As a new mom, I struggled with my daughter's chronic cough . The CDC's Robert M. Brackbill, Ph.D., M.P.H., led the team of New York City and Columbia University researchers whose study examined the longer-term health impact of exposure to Ground Zero and its varying effect across groups of people. The analysis is based on data from the World Trade Center Health Registry, described as the largest post-disaster-exposure registry in U.S. history. More than 71,000 rescue and recovery workers, lower Manhattan office workers, nearby residents, and passers-by enrolled in the registry. Participants were interviewed from September 2003 through November 2004 to record their exposure to the disaster and document their pre- and post-event health status, and again in 2006-2007. Health.com: Diabetes plus stress can equal high blood sugar . For each group followed, intense exposure to the dust plume was associated with new asthma diagnoses. Among rescue and recovery workers, for example, the asthma risk was highest for those who worked on the pile on September 11. The risk diminished with later start dates. However, even downtown office workers and lower Manhattan residents were affected. Among these people, the risk of asthma was highest if there was a heavy coating of dust in their home or office, compared with no such damage. ""It shows that people who had heavy dust exposure in the initial period, that this was a risk to developing asthma but not the only risk,"" says Reibman, who also serves as the director of New York City's World Trade Center Environmental Health Center, one of three centers dedicated to treating September 11-related conditions. Reibman says the new study is important because, in addition to corroborating previous studies, it should help people with September 11-related asthma realize that their symptoms are real.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two popular anti-smoking drugs will now carry warnings about the risk of severe mental health problems, the Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday. ""Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability and death,"" an FDA official said. The FDA said Chantix and Zyban will carry the warnings to alert consumers to the risks of depression and suicidal thoughts when using the drugs. The drugs also have been reported to cause changes in behavior, hostility and agitation in users, whether users had a history of psychiatric illness or not. In many cases, side effects started shortly after use began and ended when the medication was stopped. The FDA does not know what is causing the changes and said people taking these products should be monitored by their doctor. ""The risk of serious adverse events while taking these products must be weighed against the significant health benefits of quitting smoking,"" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability and death in the United States, and we know these products are effective aids in helping people quit."" The agency also is requiring Pfizer Inc., which makes Chantix, and GlaxoSmithKline, maker of Zyban, to conduct a study looking at how often these serious symptoms occur. Pfizer says it updated its label in 2007 to include information of neuropsychiatric symptoms and has revised the label again to reflect Wednesday's warning. ""The labeling update underscores the important role of health care providers in treating smokers attempting to quit and provides specific information about Chantix and instructions that physicians and patients should follow closely,"" said Dr. Briggs W. Morrison, senior vice president of the primary care development group at Pfizer. ""Quitting smoking is one of the best things people can do for their health, but the quitting process is both difficult and complex."" The FDA says that since Chantix was approved in 2006, the agency has had reports of 98 suicides and 188 attempted suicides. Zyban has had reports of 14 suicides and 17 attempts. Zyban contains the same active ingredient as the antidepressant Wellbutrin and already carried a box warning about the increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior. Neither Chantix nor Zyban contains nicotine, and the FDA said some symptoms could be the result of nicotine withdrawal. Still, the agency said, people using these drugs experienced some of these symptoms while they were still smoking. In a review of side effects in patients using the nicotine patch, the agency said it didn't find a clear link between those products and suicidal events.","FDA: Chantix and Zyban will carry warnings about mental health risks .

"(CNN) -- When Joanne Branham lost her husband, Frank, to a brain tumor, she was devastated. But it wasn't until she visited her old neighbors in McCullom Lake, Illinois, that she began to question the cause of his death. Back in the community where she and Frank had lived for almost 40 years, Branham learned two of her former neighbors also had brain tumors. ""It was like a light bulb went off,"" Branham recalls. ""How can that many have cancer living right next door to each other?"" Since then, more brain cancer cases have turned up, 30 in all, among current and former residents of McCullom Lake, a community of about 1,000 residents in northern Illinois, not far from the Wisconsin state line. Branham and others in McCullom Lake are now pointing the finger at a chemical plant a mile up the road in Ringwood, Illinois. For decades, they say, the Rohm and Haas plant dumped, spilled and leaked thousands of pounds of vinyl chloride and other toxic chemicals, poisoning the water and air around McCullom Lake. ""I don't think there's been a bigger brain cancer cluster outside the workplace -- ever,"" says Aaron Freiwald, attorney for 31 McCullom Lake Village plaintiffs now suing Rohm and Haas. In addition to the brain cancer cases, there is one plaintiff alleging her liver damage resulted from environmental pollution. The company denies making anyone sick. Branham's case is the first to go to trial, with jury selection set to begin Wednesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 'Frank didn't have a chance' Frank Branham died in June 2004, a month after learning that he had a deadly glioblastoma brain tumor. He was 63. ""Frank didn't have a chance,"" Joanne Branham says. ""What they did was very wrong. They played with people's lives. I lost a husband, who was my best friend. The kids lost their father. The grandkids lost their grandfather,"" she added, barely able to get her words out through her tears. Rohm and Haas says even though the cancer cases are close together, they are random. ""There is no cluster in McCullom Lake Village,"" says Kevin Van Wart, attorney for Rohm and Haas. ""If you draw circles around selected cases, you can always draw the conclusion of something unusual."" Brain and central nervous system cancers strike 7.6 per 100,000 people in the United States, according to the National Cancer Institute. An estimated 22,020 men and women in the United States will get diagnosed with these cancers this year. A month after the lawsuit was filed in 2006, the McHenry County Health Department in Illinois concluded there was no cluster of cancer cases in McCullom Lake. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did its own analysis and agreed. Originally a dairy . The Rohm and Haas site produces polymers, adhesives, resins and sealants on a 120-acre site originally built as a dairy operation in 1916 and converted to chemical manufacturing in the early 1940s. The facility has disposed its waste off site since 1978, but vinyl chloride, trichloroethylene, or TCE, and vinylidene chloride have all been found in nearby groundwater, according to the CDC. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services calls vinyl chloride ""a known carcinogen."" Long-term exposure to vinyl chloride on the job increases workers' risk of cancers of the liver, brain, lung and blood, according to the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Breathing or drinking high levels of TCE can damage the central nervous system, liver and lungs and also cause an abnormal heartbeat, according to the agency. Breathing high levels of vinylidene chloride can affect the central nervous system, liver and kidneys, the agency says. But Van Wart, the Rohm and Haas attorney, says the plume of contaminated groundwater is moving away from McCullom Lake and does not affect any homes or residential wells. ""Nobody disputes that it exists. But that is not going anywhere near McCullom Lake Village,"" Van Wart says. ""No agency has ever concluded any resident was exposed to dangerous chemicals."" To put residents' fears at ease, Rohm and Haas has offered to pay up to $50,000 to test residents' wells. There are about 400 homes with private wells in the village. The company has also offered to pay $5,000 to monitor the air for vinyl chloride and $50,000 for an independent analysis of theories of possible vinyl chloride exposure. 'A beautiful place to live' When Joanne and Frank Branham moved to McCullom Lake in August 1960, they saw a picturesque community with other young families. ""It was a beautiful place to live. We lived by a beach. We had such close neighbors. The whole subdivision was like a family,"" says Branham, who raised five children there. Frank Branham worked as general manager at a die cast plant in nearby Woodstock, Illinois. On Sundays, the husbands would go down to the beach to play baseball. The wives would pack picnic baskets and watch. Looking back, Joanne Branham says there were warning signs. In the summer, a terrible odor would sometimes force them to close their windows, she says. ""We didn't put two and two together until we found there were so many other neighbors with cancers,"" Branham says. After her husband died, Joanne Branham's children bought her a plane ticket to return to Illinois, from Phoenix, Arizona, where she and her husband had retired. Visiting old friends, she learned former next-door neighbor Bryan Freund also has a brain tumor, an oligodendroglioma. So does Kurt Weisenberger, who lives on the other side of the Freunds, two doors down from the Branhams' former home. Freund, 49, a truck driver and jewelry store owner, says he never gave the Rohm and Haas plant a second thought until Joanne Branham came back to town. ""It was really just a place I drove past,"" says Freund, who now suffers from headaches, seizures and memory loss. ""I had dreams and aspirations,"" he adds. ""Now when I look to the future it's really sort of a blank. I can't really expect to have one. That's a daily struggle."" Weisenberger, 69, a retired general contractor, says he hopes the lawsuit will bring out the truth of what happened to the people of McCullom Lake. ""It was a cover-up from the get-go as far as I'm concerned,"" says Weisenberger, who also suffers from seizures. Joanne Branham says she hopes the lawsuit, which asks for unspecified compensatory and punitive compensation, will make companies think twice. ""What they did was wrong, and if this will save one person's life and they won't do this again, it will be worth it,"" she says. The trial is expected to last 10 to 12 weeks.","McCullom Lake, a small community in Illinois, has seen 30 brain cancer cases .

"(CNN) -- Mike Loverde was 29 when his family intervened in his addiction to prescription painkillers. He remembers his parents driving him from Chicago, Illinois, to a rehab center in rural Indiana. He was crying because he wanted to get high. Be honest and nonjudgmental when you confront someone about dangerous behavior, experts say. Eight years later, Loverde is a counselor and director of program services at the Intervention Services Inc. branch outside Chicago. When someone seems to have lost control of life, or has become a danger to himself or herself, family members or friends often try to intervene. Addictions to alcohol or drugs, or an untreated mental illness, are all reasons for concern. Janet Jackson had reportedly tried in 2007 to stage an intervention for her brother Michael Jackson, who died of cardiac arrest June 25, two sources close to the Jackson family told CNN Wednesday. Britney Spears' family intervened in 2008 through the courts, after a judge in her custody case cited her for ""habitual, frequent, and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol."" Her father, Jamie Spears, was granted temporary conservatorship over her. How to intervene . Interventions can take many forms. Simply suggesting that a drug addict make an appointment for professional help may work, experts say. Speaking openly, in a compassionate tone and without judgment, is an effective way to approach these conversations, said Patrick Hart, an intervention specialist in Seattle, Washington. The addiction or other problem should be viewed as an illness that deserves professional care, he said. ""Do not expect an addicted loved one to simply stop within their own right,"" Hart said. ""Offer specified help."" A more formal, direct intervention involves family members confronting the person and encouraging the addict to seek help. Before this meeting, a professional interventionist typically meets with family members or friends of the addict to get a history of what's happened, said Dr. Marvin Seppala, chief medical officer at Hazelden Foundation. Letters are a typical component of a direct intervention: The family members or friends will explain in writing that they are doing the intervention because they love the addict, and that they have observed specific troubling behaviors, as described in the letter, Seppala said. Beforehand, the professional interventionist will try to prepare for the possibility that the addict will run away and, along with the family, create specific consequences if the person does not agree to go into treatment, Seppala said. For example, if the person is married, an addict's spouse may not permit him or her back into the home, Seppala said. If the person is living with family, the relatives may kick that person out of the house, Loverde said. The direct intervention model is not always the best method, experts say. Dr. Bankole Johnson, chairman of psychiatric medicine at the University of Virginia, said this confrontational approach leaves the addict somewhat humiliated and may reduce the benefits of rehab treatment for the person. If the intervention does not work, it creates a chasm between the family members and the addict, he said. Instead, it's best to treat the addiction as a medical problem and stress the physical consequences of it, Johnson said. Simply telling a person that he or she has a problem with alcohol or drugs is often not as effective as saying, ""You seem to be having difficulties with your sleeping, or you seem to be having difficulties with your breathing,"" he said. Recognizing enablers . Often there are people in the addict's life known as ""enablers"" who don't necessarily see the addiction as a problem, Seppala said. These may include friends, family members, doctors and, in the case celebrities, an entourage. Some celebrities become surrounded by enablers because greed and money taint the decision-making of people they know, Seppala said. ""[If] their only real claim to fame is proximity to the celebrity, or getting money out of that situation, they're going to say whatever the wealthy person wants them to say,"" he said. This may lead a well-known person with a drug problem to feel isolated, despite having a lot of people around, because he or she isn't getting the truth from anyone, Seppala said. ""You've got to count on family and friends who may have known you before you became famous,"" he said. For well-known people with drug problems, it's especially difficult to get the treatment they need because the celebrity factor may cloud doctors' care, Johnson said. ""The practitioner is saying, 'If I don't give the person what they want, they'll go and see someone else,'"" Johnson said. Sometimes people, especially family members, enable out of misguided love. For example, Loverde said that while family members do not intentionally make an addict get worse, they may not know what to do except love the person in need. But by not acting they enable that person. ""You set up a family system,"" Loverde said. ""You create the enabler, you create the punisher, you create these unhealthy family roles and people kind of mold into them based on the addiction itself."" Legal action . In most states treatment for addiction cannot be forced by family members or friends, Seppala said. That's where the legal system comes in. But it's very difficult to prove in court that a person is not able to manage his or her own life because of an addiction, experts say. Different states have different laws, but generally a conservatorship -- when someone takes legal charge of another person's decisions -- is only granted if a person is a danger to other people or to himself, Johnson said. Generally, the person has to commit a crime, such as driving while intoxicated, before the legal system gets involved in ordering treatment, Johnson said. In California, for example, a probate conservatorship involves a family member or other interested party taking over part or all decision making for an adult whose decision-making ability is impaired. It must be shown that the person cannot provide food, clothing or shelter for himself. But sometimes the very threat of police intervention is enough to prompt an addict to consent to treatment, Seppala said. The bottom line . Experts stressed that family members and friends should not wait until the person they're concerned about ""hits rock bottom"" before attempting to get help from a professional. ""Very rarely does someone wake up in the morning and say, 'I want to change,'"" Loverde said.","Janet Jackson reportedly tried to stage an intervention for her brother Michael .

"(CNN) -- Just days after giving birth to her second child, Dr. Jane Dimer drove herself home from the hospital to find her then-husband in bed with another woman. He threw Dimer down the stairs, and she never saw him again until court. Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, before the Grammys on February 8. Dimer, now an obstetrician-gynecologist at Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, Washington, had been in an abusive relationship with her husband in Germany for 4½ years until he pushed her out 11 years ago. ""Emotionally, the remnants of that stay for a long time,"" she said. Domestic violence is the most common cause of injury to women ages 15 to 44, according to the National Institutes of Health. With the entertainment world buzzing about pop sensation Rihanna, whose boyfriend Chris Brown has been formally charged with assaulting her, public interest in domestic violence has been reinvigorated. Abuse can influence a victim's future behavior in relationships and even in friendships, depending on whether the victim stays or leaves, said Mark Crawford, a clinical psychologist based in Roswell, Georgia. Those who stay are likely to stop trusting their own perceptions and become passive in both romantic and nonromantic relationships. Victims who do leave -- which is the healthier choice, Crawford said -- often become over-accommodating because they want to avoid conflict, even verbal disputes, at all costs. Some women won't trust people easily, if at all, and won't be able to handle even normal expressions of anger. Visit CNNHealth.com, your connection to better living . ""What they need to do when they get out of the relationship is make sure they're aware of their own anger, and then they can learn how to freely express it in a healthy, normal way,"" he said. ""If somebody's still having issues 10 years later, they just haven't worked through it. They haven't healed; they need to do that."" New research shows that abuse victims feel the impact of violence long after it occurred. A recent study in the Journal of Women's Health found that older African-American women who were exposed to high levels of family violence at some point in their lifetimes -- whether by a partner or family member -- are at a greater risk of poor mental and physical health status. ""Not just ongoing violence, which everybody thinks about, but even when it's over, there's something about what happens that seems to have a lingering effect that we don't quite understand yet,"" said Dr. Anuradha Paranjape, co-author of the study and associate professor at Temple University School of Medicine. It makes sense that abused women would report worse health, given that people in stressful situations have higher levels of stress hormones, which interfere with immune function, Crawford said. Other studies show a clear connection between depression and abuse. Adult women who have been abused in a relationship in the past five years have rates of depression 2½ times greater than women who have never been abused, according to a different study of more than 3,000 women. They are also more likely to be socially isolated, said author Amy Bonomi, associate professor at The Ohio State University. Women who have been abused prior to, but not during, the past five years had depression rates 1½ times greater than those without abuse experience, said Bonomi, who has collaborated with Dimer on research on abused women. ""People like to sort of think that, 'Well, abuse is just when you have a black eye, you sustain a broken bone,' "" Bonomi said. ""But we see lots of different effects in other areas, like depression and social isolation, and we've actually proven that with the data."" Women who have suffered violence also seem to have a greater likelihood of substance abuse, but it's unclear how the two are related -- one doesn't necessarily cause the other, and there could be other factors involved, Bonomi said. A 2008 study of 3,333 women, which Bonomi worked on, found that middle-aged women who suffered child abuse, sexual or other physical abuse, had a greater likelihood of depression, as well as a higher body mass index. These women also spend up to one-third more than average on health care costs. About 34 percent of women in the sample said they had been abused. While Paranjape's study found that women with the highest levels of abuse reported having poor health, the same number of diseases were reported among those women as the women in the sample who had less or no abuse. This indicates that there is something else that makes abused women report feeling unwell, she said. ""When your patient says they don't feel so good, you might want to think about asking what other issues may be going on,"" she said. People who have gotten out of a relationship should go through the work of learning what issues set them up in that situation, and reflect on the warning signs, Crawford said. Experts recommend finding a counselor and other means of support, but people who have been abused should think twice about revealing too much in online support groups, because their abusers could discover what they're saying, Dimer said. Research has also shown that violence escalates in abusive relationships among couples who go to marriage counseling, she said.

"(Health.com) -- An antibiotic widely used to treat diarrhea in travelers may also provide some relief to people with the common and difficult-to-treat condition known as irritable bowel syndrome, according to a pair of new studies in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved the antibiotic, rifaximin, for use in IBS, which affects as many as 1 in 5 U.S. adults. The agency is currently reviewing the drug for that purpose and is expected to make a decision in March. In the studies, 1,200 IBS patients took rifaximin or a placebo pill three times a day for two weeks. Roughly 40 percent of the patients who took the antibiotic reported substantial relief from symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, and loose stools for at least two weeks during the subsequent month, compared with a little under one-third of the patients taking placebo. All of the patients in the studies had a form of IBS that does not involve constipation. Health.com: 12 surprising causes of constipation . ""It made all the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome better, which we don't see too often in studies,"" says the lead researcher, Mark Pimentel, M.D., a gastroenterologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, in Los Angeles. The studies were funded by the maker of rifaximin, Salix Pharmaceuticals, which was also involved in collecting and analyzing the data. (This arrangement isn't unusual in these types of studies, which are known as phase 3 trials and are generally the last research step in the FDA approval process.) In addition, Pimentel and several of his co-authors report financial relationships with Salix, including receiving consulting fees from the company. Health.com: Quick cures for stomach troubles . Rifaximin, sold under the brand name Xifaxan for travelers' diarrhea, appears to be safe and doesn't seem to foster resistance among gut bacteria, meaning it can be used over and over, Pimentel says. That could be important, because the number of study participants who reported lasting relief from their two-week rifaximin regimen gradually declined in the 10 weeks following treatment. Despite the relatively small percentage of patients who responded to the drug, doctors who have been frustrated by the lack of effective IBS treatments say they would welcome another option. Charlene Prather, M.D., a professor of internal medicine at Saint Louis University, in Missouri, says that while she'd hoped to see a ""more robust effect"" from rifaximin in the studies, she nevertheless would like the FDA to approve the drug for IBS. ""It still provides me with something I can offer my patients,"" says Prather, who was not involved in the new research. Health.com: 10 things that can make incontinence worse . Currently, ""there are no good options"" for treating IBS, says Timothy Pfanner, M.D., a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M Health Science Center, in Temple. Rifaximin may benefit a subgroup of patients with IBS, Pfanner says, although he stresses that most people in the study did not experience relief from their symptoms. ""As a doctor, I'd need to treat 10 patients for one to improve,"" he adds. Rifaximin would be the first antibiotic approved by the FDA for the treatment of IBS. Aside from providing evidence of the drug's effectiveness, the study findings -- especially with regard to bloating -- support the theory that bacteria may be partially responsible for IBS. Health.com: Alternative therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Bloating is sometimes thought to be related to bacterial imbalances in the gut, and antibiotics are a class of drugs that work only against bacteria. ""That suggests that we hit upon a cause of IBS,"" Pimentel says. This theory is still controversial. Prather says that while there is some evidence to suggest that bacteria plays a role in IBS, it's unclear whether changes in gut bacteria are a cause or an effect of the syndrome.

"(CNN) -- Some heartburn medications could increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fractures in high doses or with long-term use, the Food and Drug Administration warned. Such so-called proton pump inhibitors are used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, stomach and small intestine ulcers and inflammation of the esophagus, along with frequent heartburn. They include esomeprazole, sold under the brand name Nexium, dexlansoprazole (Dexilant). lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), pantoprazole (Protonix) and rabeprazole (Aciphex). Over-the-counter versions include omeprazole (Prilosec OTC, Zegerid OTC) and lansoprazole (Prevacid 24HR). The product labeling will be changed to describe the possible increased risk, the FDA said in a statement Tuesday. ""Epidemiology studies suggest a possible increased risk of bone fractures with the use of proton pump inhibitors for one year or longer, or at high doses,"" said Dr. Joyce Korvick, deputy director for safety in FDA's Division of Gastroenterology Products. ""Because these products are used by a great number of people, it's important for the public to be aware of this possible increased risk and, when prescribing proton pump inhibitors, health care professionals should consider whether a lower dose or shorter duration of therapy would adequately treat the patient's condition."" The warning and revised labeling stems from the FDA's review of several studies that reported an increased risk of hip, wrist and spine fractures in people using proton pump inhibitors. The warnings and precaution sections of prescription labels and the drug facts label on over-the-counter medications will address the findings, the agency said.","Some heartburn, ulcer medications carry risk of fractures, FDA warns .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have shut down a Texas food processing plant, saying it was contaminated by bacteria linked to the deaths of four people, state health officials said. The Texas Department of State Health Services on Wednesday ordered Sangar Produce and Processing to immediately stop processing food and recall all products shipped from its San Antonio plant since January. This comes after state laboratory results showed Listeria monocytogenes, a bacteria that can cause severe illness, in chopped celery at the plant. Four people died after contracting listeriosis after consuming celery that had been processed at the Sangar plant, said Carrie Williams, a department spokeswoman. State health authorities came to this determination while investigating 10 cases in which people with serious underlying health problems contracted listeriosis over an 8-month period. Six of those cases -- in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo counties -- were linked to chopped celery processed at the SanGar plant, the state health services department said. Four of those people died, as did one other person who authorities believe got listeriosis from another source not connected with Sangar products. Sangar, however, sharply questioned the state's findings and strongly denied wrongdoing, saying it has had ""an excellent record of safety and health"" over the past three years. Its president said outside tests ""directly contradict"" the state's conclusion. ""The independent testing shows our produce to be absolutely safe, and we are aggressively fighting the state's erroneous findings,"" said Kenneth Sanquist, president of Sangar. State health inspectors said they believe the bacteria found in the chopped celery may have contaminated other products at the company's plant. Sangar processes a wide variety of products -- including three varieties of lettuce, peppers, carrots, cucumbers and various cut-up fruit, as well as salad, fruit and soup mixes, according to the company's website. They are distributed primarily in sealed packages to restaurants, hospitals, schools and other large institutions that serve food. Besides the bacteria, inspectors found a condensation leak above a food product area, dirt on a food-preparation table, and hand-washing problems at the San Antonio plant, the state health department said. The state said that it is contacting distributors, restaurants and others who may have received Sangar products. Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium found in the soil, in water, and in animals that carry it without showing signs they are sick, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can get into vegetables from soil or manure that is used as fertilizer. The strain of bacteria is relatively resilient -- with an incubation period of three to 70 days, Williams said -- and some foods can be contaminated after cooking but prior to packaging. The bacteria have been tied to listeriosis, which sickens about 2,500 Americans and contributes to the death of 500 people annually, the CDC reports. People with weakened immune systems, including newborns and the elderly, are especially susceptible to listeriosis. Pregnant women are about 20 times more likely than other adults to contract the disease. In August, Sanquist told CNN affiliate KENS5 that food-safety measures were not tough enough, saying the U.S. Food and Drug Administration should be more involved in inspections. At the time, the SanGar president said that his company had never had a high bacteria count or had anything recalled. ""Ultimately, you can get someone very sick,"" Sanquist told KENS5, criticizing city health inspections as insufficient. ""We're talking about fresh-cut fruits and vegetables that need to be sanitized."" The Texas health department is taking the lead in the investigation, with assistance from the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC. The state justified its closure of the Sangar plant, citing Texas law that authorizes such actions if conditions pose ""an immediate and serious threat to human life or health."" ""At this point, the order prohibits the plant from reopening without our approval,"" said Williams. ""We will work with the company about setting up some guidelines before it can [reopen].""","NEW: Four people died after eating celery processed at Sangar plant, officials say .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Food and Drug Administration committee delivered a split verdict on the diabetes drug Avandia on Wednesday, with most members voting to leave it on the market but recommending different changes in how it's prescribed. Twelve of the committee's 33 members voted to pull Avandia off the market altogether, while only three supported leaving it on the market with its current labeling. Seven voted to add stiffer warnings to the current label, and 10 wanted both stiffer language and restrictions on its use. The vote came on the second day of hearings into the safety of the drug, which studies since 2007 have linked to an increased risk of heart failure. One member abstained, and several said their votes easily could have gone another way. ""I think the evidence of potential harm is stronger now than it was in 2007,"" said Dr. Peter Savage, the director of the National Institutes of Health's epidemiology division, who voted for stronger warnings and restrictions. ""I think if the drug is to remain on the market, we need to consider whether there would be some specific indications in which it would be reserved for use. It seems to me that simply putting a warning, a black-box warning, in the labeling is probably not sufficient to really protect patients."" FDA officials will make a decison on what to do with the medication ""as soon as possible,"" said Janet Woodcock, director of the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Avandia manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline has insisted on the safety of the medication, which is used to control blood sugar levels in diabetics. But a company-sponsored study that Glaxo said showed there was no higher risk of heart problems came under heavy fire from FDA researchers during proceedings Tuesday and Wednesday. In a statement issued after the vote, Glaxo reiterated its belief in the safety of the drug and said Avandia ""remains available to physicians and appropriate patients"" to treat type 2 diabetes. ""Following today's recommendations, we will, of course, continue to work with the FDA in the best interest of diabetes patients who face this chronic and serious disease,"" Dr. Ellen Strahlman, the company's chief medical officer, said in the statement. ""Patients taking Avandia should speak with their physician about their treatment and any questions they may have regarding the safety of the medicine."" But Dr. Daniel Einhorn, president of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, said the decision was ""hardly a ringing endorsement"" of the drug. In two preliminary votes, the FDA panel found that Avandia has an increased risk of heart problems compared with other drugs -- but it made the same determination in 2007 without voting to pull the drug, recommending stronger warnings instead. The committee would not conclude the drug poses an increased risk of death, with most calling the data before them insufficient. ""Until we have a longer-term follow-up we just can't say much about mortality,"" said committee member Dale Hammerschmidt, a University of Minnesota medical professor. Before the vote, Chuck Keyserling, who suffers from type 2 diabetes, told the panel he has been taking Avandia for 10 years and can't take an alternative drug because of his physical limits on exercise. ""In making this plea to keep Avandia on the market, I believe I am pleading for my life,"" Keyserling said. For people in his position, he said, ""a negative position on Avandia may be a death sentence."" A strongly worded FDA report last week called Glaxo's RECORD study, which the company cites as evidence of the drug's safety, ""inappropriate and biased."" It accused Glaxo of repeatedly submitting sloppy data and failing to follow up on reports of problems among patients, including deaths. And Dr. David Graham, the author of a June study that also found higher risk of heart problems among Avandia users, said the RECORD study would have been dismissed as ""garbage"" if it had been used to seek the drug's original approval. But Dr. Murray Stewart, Glaxo's vice president for clinical development, said Tuesday that the company's studies ""provide the most robust and reliable data"" to assess Avandia's safety -- and those studies have found ""no evidence to suggest"" the drug increases the risk of heart problems. Stewart defended the RECORD study again Wednesday. Glaxo says several trials have shown Avandia is safe, but its usage has fallen sharply since a 2007 study that linked it to an increased risk of heart attacks and other related problems. Published estimates indicate annual sales of Avandia have dropped from about $3 billion in 2006 to about $1 billion. A Senate committee added to the controversy Tuesday. Its leaders released documents they said show Glaxo ""failed to publish studies that found serious health risks associated with Avandia in a timely manner and actively promoted the drug despite the known safety concerns."" The documents, which the Senate Finance Committee provided to the FDA, include studies that date back to 2000, the committee's Democratic chairman and ranking Republican said. But in an e-mail, Glaxo spokeswoman Mary Anne Rhyne told CNN the new documents were ""a small subset"" of millions of pages the company released in connection with lawsuits over the drugs. ""They include drafts and other documents taken out of context, which therefore are incomplete and misleading,"" Rhyne said. ""The documents do not offer new clinically relevant scientific information, and do not provide the full extent of GSK's studies and evaluation of Avandia.""","NEW: The decision is ""hardly a ringing endorsement,"" doctor says .

"(CNN) -- When Tiffany Wilson noticed a small growth on her left hip, she didn't think much of it. Tiffany Wilson, 41, found a bump on her hip that she thought was a pimple. It turned out to be skin cancer. ""It was bizarre,"" recalled the 41-year-old salon owner from Minneapolis, Minnesota. ""I just thought it was a pimple."" Wilson, who is African-American, can't say exactly what prompted her to point out the bump to her physician, but she said she remembered thinking the diagnosis wouldn't be anything serious. ""It never occurred to me that it was skin cancer,"" she said. But it was. She had basal cell carcinoma, the most common skin cancer. Wilson spent long hours as a child in the summer sun at Lake Nokomis in Minnesota and went to the tanning bed before visiting relatives in the Caribbean, she said. She also said she never wore sunscreen. ""Back then, I just don't think people were aware of the effects [of the sun],"" she said. Those may seem like obvious red flags to people who are sun-conscious, but they were foreign concepts to Wilson, which is why her diagnosis came as a shock. ""I just assumed, 'I'm a person of color, I'll be OK,' "" she said. Dermatologists say they are concerned because skin cancer rates are increasing among minority groups in the United States. Like Wilson, many people of color often mistakenly believe skin cancer is not something they should be worried about. Pigmentation is no 'free pass' The reasoning is not completely far-fetched: Darker-skinned people do benefit from the protective effects of skin pigmentation. In fact, some studies suggest that for the darkest skin tones, pigmentation cells provide a natural sun protection factor, or SPF, of about 13. The problem is many dark-skinned people believe that means they are born with a natural immunity to skin cancer. ""Pigmentation doesn't give you a free pass,"" said Dr. Charles E. Crutchfield III, a dermatologist specializing in ethnic skin and the doctor who treated Tiffany Wilson. ""It doesn't matter what color your skin is, everyone can get skin cancer."" Bob Marley, for example, died of malignant melanoma, the most lethal type of skin cancer, that spread to his lungs and brain. All types of skin cancer are increasing among blacks and Hispanics, and their melanomas are more often fatal because they are usually caught later, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Crutchfield pointed out that pigmentation may have sun-protective qualities but even for the darkest skin it falls short of the AAD's recommendation of a daily SPF of at least 15 for everyone. Crutchfield feels many ethnic groups are missing that key part of the message, if they are getting the message at all. Blog: How to pick the right sunscreen . Researchers acknowledge that many of the messages regarding skin cancer prevention have traditionally targeted fair-skinned people, a group 10 times more likely to develop melanoma. Now, dermatologists say, more needs to be done to encourage all groups to take precautions against sun damage. A Consumer Reports survey found only 27 percent of people with self-described darker skin applied sunscreen when they were in the sun for four hours or more, compared with 64 percent of people with self-described light skin. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2009 there will be more than 1 million unreported cases of basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer -- most of them curable -- and that more than 68,000 cases of melanoma will be diagnosed. For melanoma, the key to a cure is early detection. That's why dermatologists caution everyone to be vigilant and learn the risks for their skin type. ""Race is very important because not all skin is the same,"" said Dr. Susan Taylor of The Skin of Color Center, a dermatology group focusing on the needs of patients of color. According to Taylor, people with darker skin often get diagnosed at later stages because the cancers often appear in atypical locations. Melanomas in African-Americans and darker-skinned Hispanics and Asians develop more commonly on the palms, soles of the feet, toenails, fingernails and in mucus membranes like around the mouth and genitals, she said. In Caucasian and lighter-skinned Hispanics, melanomas more frequently appear on the back in men and on the legs in women. Also, the signs of melanoma may vary depending on skin tone. ""Skin hue can affect the way lesions look,"" Crutchfield said. ""Things that appear red in white skin often look completely different in skin of color."" Historically, research and teaching was done on fairer-skinned people, making it more challenging for physicians to recognize suspicious moles on darker skin. While these differences present challenges, they are certainly not barriers. Experts say, the best thing to do is keep it simple. ""If you have any lesion or mole change at all, or if you have a spot that bleeds and doesn't heal in three weeks, see a physician or a dermatologist,"" Dr. Crutchfield recommended. ""That's something everyone can do."" Visit the American Academy of Dermatology Web site to find free screening locations in your state . Another piece of simple advice: ""All racial groups need to use sunscreens,"" Taylor stresses. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both deep-penetrating UVA rays and burn-causing UVB rays. Not all sunscreens protect against both. Visit the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep cosmetic safety database . Tiffany Wilson is heeding that advice. She said she's learned that when it comes to prevention, the worst thing you can possibly do is nothing. ""I use extreme caution in the sun and make certain that I use a sunscreen, even on a cloudy day,"" she said. ""You shouldn't underestimate the rays of the sun. ""","Dermatologists report increased incidence of skin cancer among people of color .

"(CNN) -- Dr Yves Jean-Bart, President of the Haiti Football Federation, tells CNN about the day that the earthquake struck, the devastating aftermath and his hope for the future of soccer in the country. What happened on the day of the earthquake? I went to the federation around 1pm to meet the President of the Women's league and the members of the commission of the league - we had to discuss a lot of matters. Also present at the meeting were Hancy Lescouflair (wife of the Minister of Sports and the Women's League President) and the national head coach Jean Yves Labaze. The meeting was over and I was getting ready to leave when I felt the house shaking. I ran towards the back exit of the house. While going downstairs it was shaking really badly, I lost my balance and fell and blocks of debris fell on my hand. I got up and fell again with a huge amount of debris falling on my body. I was scared but I got up again to move away from the house that I then saw collapse in a white cloud. With the few that were able to escape this tragedy, and also the friends of the football family, we started helping people trapped under the rubble. During the whole night, even in darkness and with their lives in danger, those young friends of football saved and removed a few injured colleagues under the rubble. Unfortunately, more than 30 perished and even more saddening, we were not able to recover their body for days. Every day we go to the ruins of our office, and we had a memorial ceremony for all our colleagues that perished. We were helpless, beside three cases, to remove their bodies and return them to their families. What was going through your mind after the earthquake? I had many thoughts going through my head for many days after and not having communication, we were unable to obtain information. When some friends were able to recover my Blackberry, I started working and trying to reorganize. I started by contacting the parents of the young boys and girls, miraculously saved because they were practicing at the National Stadium, and helped those that were in need. I was also deeply in pain with my injuries and the loss of some of my family. Psychologically, I had a lot of questions. I was terribly choked. What was left of the Haiti Football Federation? From the headquarters there was nothing left. All our office equipment, all of what we were able to acquire throughout the years in order to put together a decent office - our efforts to have a nice archive, our trophies and distinctions during the last years - we lost everything. But most of all we lost a lot of colleagues including our best coach for the past years, all the equipment of our national teams, thousands of balls recently purchased everything...everything. How did you cope in those days after the earthquake? It's hard to adapt yourself to this, it's a whole different ball game. I did not have any meds and my injured fingers started to get infected. We were sleeping on the ground with the mosquitoes, the wind, the cold and the loud noises of airplanes coming in and out of the airport. Fortunately some colleagues were able to recover my Blackberry -- it was damaged but functional. We were able to get together, us members of the federation, and we all did our best to get back to work progressively. My kids were fabulous - they were able to send me meds, tents, sleeping bags and some money to cover every day expenses. Physically things got better but it has been a horrible misery up to now. What help did you receive from your neighboring countries and from FIFA itself? The support we received was the most comforting. Less than four days after the earthquake, Captain Burrell, the President of the Jamaican Football Federation, arrived in two helicopters sent by the Presidents of FIFA & CONCACAF. We accompanied him on a small tour of the town and met leaders in the stadium and on the ruins of our headquarters. The very emotional report that he wrote touched the world football family even more on the hugeness of the tragedy. The president of the Dominican Football Federation sent colleagues to check on us and find out about our needs. He also sent me some meds that were very precious. President Blatter and a lot of his colleagues called me and assured me that we were not alone. About two weeks ago, with a lot of difficulties, FIFA Vice-President Jack Warner made it to Port-au-Prince in a private plane and brought us meds, foods and water. He promised to motivate the FIFA committee about our needs, promised that FIFA would help our national teams to keep competing, all in all helping us rebuild our soccer. At FIFA, last Tuesday, during the meeting of the associations, a lot of Presidents of Federations were present. A minute's silence was observed for all the victims of the earthquake and during a special meeting, President Blatter announced to me that a special fund was created for the reconstruction of our football. FIFA experts will come to Haiti soon to evaluate our needs, build projects that FIFA will finance from this newly created fund. This is a big solidarity move. On February 26 with the help of the Venezuelan government we will play a charity game in Caracas. On March 7th, with the help of a German TV station, our men's national team will play a game to raise funds that will be used to rebuild the stadium of Leogane that was completely destroyed. Some former world athletes have agreed to participate in this game. The Germans have already visited this stadium and plan to help us for a while with this project. Soccer federations of the whole world - Qatar, Switzerland, Honduras, Nicaragua and Mexico -- offered their help and we are deeply touched by this move. How many of Haiti's players were affected by the earthquake? The number of dead and injured announced, is really, really far from reality. The very bad construction of the country, the lack of organization in general, the fact that the first response help got on the ground days after, will make the final numbers very high, higher than the official numbers given. Fortunately with the fact the earthquake happened at 4:53pm, the players of Divisions 1 and 2 were unharmed. The players lost immediate families: parents, wives, children. A lot of young players are orphans. When communication is fully restored and obviously when teams start training again, we will have an idea but the numbers will never be exact. How does Haiti as a country feel about football? There is not one Haitian that has not touched a soccer ball. Football is part of the everyday life of Haiti, even with the scary living conditions in Port-au-Prince, even with the fields being occupied, they still play soccer. It is the only entertainment reserved for everybody. At the federation we had the great idea of distributing in the temporary shelters the few soccer balls we were able to recover and it was an explosion of joy. I think it is necessary and mandatory, to help with the psychological recovery of a major part of the population, to free the fields and allow the people to release some stress. In times of crisis like this does it help having something like football help to focus you? It is a big challenge that motivates us better, gives us the desire to live. My biggest objective is for the soccer family to become more united every day, because until recently the soccer family was disunited. We feel that we have more responsibility than before. With all this solidarity coming from all around the world, with the situation of the youth, with this cruel misery and this sudden loss for everybody, we feel that soccer has an important role to play in the reconstruction of this country. How will you rebuild the federation and how long will it take? It will be difficult - the conditions are impossible for us. My colleagues at the federation are aware that every time we try to restart the soccer world in Haiti an unfortunate situation puts us back to square one. In 2003 we had to stop everything during a political crisis. In 2003 we had Hurricane Jeanne. In 2005 there was the security crisis with the departure of President Aristide. In 2008 there were the four hurricanes of the summer. Every time it is an exodus of talent, the loss of the buying power of the population and each time we have to start from scratch. Fortunately with new players, the work that we maintain with the young players, with the heavy support of FIFA, we climbed back up the ladder because in all age categories our teams are some of the best in the region. Do you think the federation will grow strong again in the future? I want to talk about construction and reconstruction at the same time. Haitian soccer has existed for more than 100 years. Soccer is a tradition deeply involved in the culture, the life of the country. The misery of the country affected its international evolvement but not its creativity, its popularity, its power and national weight. In this domain, with no doubt, everything exists, we will have to motivate - sensibly, because the human factor exists - in order to create an elite of players, to allow young talents to use soccer to get out of the misery, with the goal of obtaining a major professional contract and bringing money back to the country, or attending school abroad. We need to take charge of the most talented and ask for the resources that we need. We ask for infrastructures in the reconstruction process that the government will start to put at the service of these young talents and sports associations. The Latin American countries insisted on sports infrastructures that didn't exist for the youth. FIFA will help to rebuild our headquarters. It should be a reality before the end of this year. For the destroyed fields at Leoganea and Petit Goave, this should not take time. Destroyed or not by the earthquake, all the soccer fields are only by name, all of them need to be rebuilt because they weren't really existent before. With the lack of resources we had in the past we were able to accomplish so much, now with all the support that we will get, we will come back stronger than before.","January's earthquake killed 30 of Haiti's Football Federation officials .

"(CNN) -- Actor Patrick Swayze's achievements include several feature films such as ""Dirty Dancing"" and ""Ghost,"" as well as living with advanced pancreatic cancer for longer than most patients. Patrick Swayze died at age 57 of pancreatic cancer. He fought the disease for nearly two years. That Swayze, who died Monday at age 57, survived nearly two years with the condition is ""quite an accomplishment,"" Dr. George Fisher, an oncologist who treated the star at Stanford Hospitals and Clinics, told CNN's Larry King on Tuesday. Fisher revealed in early March 2008 that the actor was fighting pancreatic cancer. Swayze participated in a clinical trial at Stanford and took an experimental drug there, Fisher said. Fewer than one in four patients who have the disease that has spread outside the pancreas, as Swayze did, are alive a year later, he said.  Watch Fisher talk to King about Swayze's case » . ""Patients can survive two years -- even longer, even with standard treatment,"" Fisher said. ""It's just sad that not as many do."" Pancreatic cancer has affected several other prominent figures, including National Collegiate Athletic Association President Myles Brand, who died of the disease Wednesday. Apple Inc.'s Steve Jobs and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg have also undergone treatment for the disease. The American Cancer Society puts pancreatic cancer as the fourth most common cause of death from cancer in the United States. Lung, colon and breast cancer are the first three. Experts say that about 95 percent of those with pancreatic cancer die from the disease. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice or sudden weight loss may lead doctors to look for pancreatic cancer, said Dr. Steven Cohen, acting chief for gastrointestinal medical oncology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Cohen was not involved in Swayze's care. Doctors say early detection carries a better chance of curing the cancer, but often a patient's disease is diagnosed after it has spread. CAT scans may detect the disease early, but that does not mean everyone should have a scan with their physical, Fisher said. ""We're developing algorithms for trying to identify people at risk, and then less invasive ... tests to try to figure out who's got it and who doesn't,"" he said. Despite his illness, Swayze went forward with plans to star in A&E network's ""The Beast."" After the actor responded well to cancer treatment, the network agreed to shoot an entire season of the show. Working on the show while undergoing treatment was ""a great idea,"" Fisher said on ""Larry King Live."" ""I had my doubts as to whether he could actually do it or not, and we had many conversations around that fact,"" Fisher said. Swayze understood ""how difficult the treatment could be, and he understood how difficult the disease could be. But it's just like Patrick to just say he's going to do it and damn it, nobody should get in his way."" ""The Beast"" was canceled in June because of Swayze's illness, after doctors told him the cancer had spread to his liver. For pancreatic cancer patients, doctors are not as concerned with what happens with the pancreas as they are with how the disease spreads elsewhere, often to the liver or abdominal cavity, Cohen said. Failure of other organs that the cancer affects may ultimately cause death. Swayze's participation in the Stanford clinical trial is an important take-away point, Cohen said. Only about 5 percent of cancer patients participate in clinical trials, he said. ""Particularly for a disease like pancreatic cancer, where the standard treatments help some patients but not the majority, the ability to look at new treatments that are promising in the context and controlled setting of clinical trials, I think, is really important,"" he said. Dozens of drugs are in development or being tested in trials for pancreatic cancer, Cohen said. One such medication is paclitaxel, which is currently only approved for breast cancer but has shown promise experimentally in pancreatic tumors, he said. Cohen said he and his colleagues encourage patients to continue their daily activities and live their lives normally as best they can while undergoing treatment. A chemotherapy drug commonly used in patients, called gemcitabine, does not have the harsh symptoms of nausea, vomiting and hair loss seen in other cancer drugs. But sometimes, patients are too ill from their underlying cancer to do much, he said. ""Toward the end, they can get increasing abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite, very low energy, sort of a wasting syndrome, and there, a lot of patients just don't feel up to do anything,"" he said.","Patrick Swayze battled pancreatic cancer for nearly two years .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that it has stopped reviewing drug applications from an India-based pharmaceutical plant, alleging that officials there falsified data and test results in applications, some of which the agency has already approved. In its second action in six months against Ranbaxy's Paonta Sahib plant, the FDA invoked its Application Integrity Policy, which is usually invoked over concerns about the integrity of data in drug applications. In September, the FDA issued an import alert barring entry of generic drugs produced at the plant in northeastern India and two others owned by Ranbaxy. That order remains in effect. A man who answered the phone at the company's offices in Gurgaon, Haryana, India, said no one was available for comment. No one immediately answered an e-mail sent Wednesday to the company's U.S. corporate offices in Princeton, New Jersey. Under the Application Integrity Policy, the most recent action, the FDA has stopped all scientific review of any new or pending drug approval applications containing data from the Paonta Sahib plant. In a letter sent Wednesday to the company, the agency alleged that data submitted from the Ranbaxy plant contained falsified information -- including lies that safety tests were conducted, lies that drugs had been kept at room temperature when in fact they had been stored in refrigerators, and lies about the shelf life of some drugs. ""Companies must provide truthful and accurate information in their marketing applications,"" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a statement on the FDA Web site. ""The American public expects and deserves no less."" An investigation is under way, but the FDA said it has no evidence that drugs manufactured at the plant do not meet quality specifications. In a written statement e-mailed to CNN, a spokesperson said the company had just been notified of the action. ""Ranbaxy will analyze the letter and other information fully and respond appropriately in a timely manner,"" it said. ""The FDA has said it has no evidence the drugs on the market are substandard and also that they comply with specifications upon testing,"" it added. Deborah Autor, director of the drug evaluation center's Office of Compliance, said there is no reason to believe Ranbaxy drugs on U.S. shelves pose any safety threat. She said all 80 samples tested met application specifications. ""We feel comfortable leaving those products on the U.S. market at this time,"" she said. The FDA said it has approved some 25 drug applications that contain data from Paonta Sahib. The applications affected by Wednesday's announcement are for approved drugs made for the U.S. market, drugs pending approval but not yet on the market, and certain drugs manufactured in Ranbaxy's Ohm Laboratories in New Jersey, which relied on data from the Paonta Sahib plant. Three generic drugs were produced at Ohm Laboratories: simvastatin (Zocor) and pravastatin (Pravachol), both cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins, and the antihistamine loratadine (Claritin). The four plants in India that make drugs approved for distribution in the United States have been inspected more than 20 times since 2005, the FDA said. The FDA advised patients to talk with their doctor before considering stopping any medications.","FDA stops drug applications from India-based drug plant .

"(CNN) -- A U.N. investigator accused Kenyan police of widespread extrajudicial killings, and called Wednesday for the removal of the East African nation's police commissioner and its attorney general. Philip Alston called for Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki (pictured) to fire the police commissioner. ""Killings by the police in Kenya are systematic, widespread and carefully planned. They are committed at will and with utter impunity,"" U.N. Special Rapporteur Philip Alston said in a written statement on his preliminary findings after his visit to the country. The Kenyan government said it rejected Alston's findings. ""The government finds it inconceivable that someone who has been in the country for less than ten days can purport to have conducted comprehensive and accurate research on such a serious matter, as to arrive at the recommendations he made,"" government spokesman Alfred Matua said in a written statement. He said the government was concerned Alston made ""such far-reaching conclusions and recommendations on the basis of his interim report,"" and said the findings were released without government response. Alston said he heard ""overwhelming"" testimony of the killings, which he said occurred regularly. The police commissioner and other senior Kenyan police officials denied the accusations, he said. The police may kill for personal reasons, for extortion or for ransom, Alston said. He added, ""Often they kill in the name of crime control, but in circumstances where they could readily make an arrest. He cited as an example James Ng'ang'a Kariuki Muiruri, 29, whom he said police shot and killed last month in the capital, Nairobi. ""After a disagreement at a hotel, a police officer stopped the car James and his brother were in, and ordered James to handcuff himself. When he asked why he was being arrested, James was shot three times,"" Alson said in the news release. ""The only exceptional things about the case were that James was the son of a former Member of Parliament, and the incident had been witnessed,"" he said. Alston said there was no accountability for the alleged police killings; there is no independent police internal affairs unit. He called for Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki to fire the police commissioner. ""Any serious commitment to ending the impunity that currently reigns in relation to the widespread and systematic killings by the police should begin with the immediate dismissal of the police commissioner. In the absence of such a step it will be impossible to conclude that there is a strong commitment at the very top to deal with this problem."" As for Attorney General Amos Wako, Alston's comments were severe, and he called for his resignation. ""Mr. Wako is the embodiment in Kenya of the phenomenon of impunity."" Alston also accused government security forces of torturing and killing hundreds of men in a March 2008 crackdown on a militia in the Mt. Elgon district, in western Kenya. And he said there was compelling evidence that what he called police death squads were operating in Nairobi and Central Province with a mandate to ""exterminate"" suspected Mungiki gang members. ""These are not 'rogue' squads, but police who are acting on the explicit orders of their superiors,"" he said. The Mungiki militia, which are loyal to Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe, began as a religious sect, but over the years has morphed into a gang that runs protection rackets -- particularly in the slums. The U.N. investigator suggested Kibaki acknowledge the alleged police killings and commit to stop them. He also advocated that an independent civilian police oversight body be created, and said the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court should investigate violence after the 2007 election. He also said the government should create a witness protection program. Alston traveled to Kenya after the government invited him, staying from February 15 until Wednesday. He will issue a final report of his findings, but it was not immediately clear when it would be released.","U.N. investigator alleges widespread killings by police .

"Thanks to the flu, a broken ankle, a staph infection, and bronchitis, plus several school cancellations, my three children were at home -- hurting, vomiting, coughing, or tracking muddy water into our house -- all but seven days last February. (Shall I pause to let the horror of that number sink in? All but seven.) I'm normally an efficient, organized person who thrives on plans and checklists, but by the end of that month, I'd accomplished almost nothing beyond reading aloud the entire fifth book of Harry Potter. I felt so anxious that I was on the verge of hyperventilation. Originally a form of self-defense, the ancient Chinese art of tai chi promotes serenity through gentle movement. ""You need to close your eyes, take a deep breath, and imagine yourself surrounded by an egg of light,"" a Buddhist friend said. But when I closed my eyes and took a breath, I was surrounded by used tissues and dirty laundry. Obviously, I was in need of some inner peace. Studies have shown that learning to still the mind, if only for a few minutes, can lower blood pressure, reduce heart rate, limit stress hormones, and enhance immune function. But traditional forms of meditation don't work for me. If I sit still and close my eyes, I fall asleep or think about my to-do list. So, I gave myself a new task: Find an activity that calms my mind without giving my weary body a chance to nod off. Does such a thing exist? Health.com: Making time for me . Tai chi . This ancient Chinese practice -- believed to offer all the health benefits of silent meditation while giving you something to do with your hands and feet -- seemed like an obvious place to start for an antsy, toe-tapping sort like me. The thing is, I have a poor sense of balance and tai chi often requires standing on one foot. To avoid the not-so-peaceful experience of looking like a dork in front of a group of total strangers, I opted for a DVD, with only the tiniest hope of success. I surprised myself. The quiet music and the calm voice of the middle-aged woman demonstrating the moves were so reassuring that I forgot I looked like an idiot. The effort it took to follow along in what resembles the slow-motion version of a beautiful dance was literally mesmerizing. If I didn't feel peaceful, exactly, at least I was filled with quiet concentration, the kind that banishes all thoughts of picky eaters, mortgage payments, and unreliable co-workers. I emerged from the first lesson feeling refreshed and rested. Health.com: A new prescription for happiness . Knitting . I have friends who are passionate about knitting. Don't they know that it's possible to buy an immediately wearable sweater for less than the cost of the yarn it takes to knit one? Nonetheless, stressed-out 21st-century workingwomen are returning in droves to the craft. It made no sense to me ... until I tried it, that is. Knitting, it turns out, is the perfect example of active stillness. In fact, 20 minutes of knitting can lower your heart rate and blood pressure -- the same physical response triggered by yoga, Tai Chi, or meditation. Some hospitals have even begun to offer knitting courses for stress release. The secret seems to lie in the soothing combination of rhythm and repetition. By the end of my first lesson, I'd become proficient enough that my hands could make the motions almost automatically. The sound of the needles had a metronomic quality, a calming pace that automatically slowed my thoughts. And the feel of the wool sliding through my fingers was almost like a caress. Health.com: Boost your mood with color . Walking in the woods . I'd read somewhere that exposure to nature can boost a person's general well-being and sense of calm -- and I certainly needed a dose of that. So I headed to some nearby woods where the redbuds and crab apples were in full bloom. Birds called piercingly, squirrels quarreled, and high branches clattered together in the wind. In other words, nothing about the forest was still or quiet or remotely peaceful, but somehow it made me feel peaceful. I stopped thinking about my family and work deadlines and all that laundry. In fact, I stopped thinking altogether. Back at my car, I checked the clock and was shocked to learn that more than an hour had passed. Now, I can't realistically give up an hour every day to nature. But studies have shown that even small doses of nature can be healing, so I've tried a few smaller-scale nature interactions, as well. I started a small aquarium, planted a windowsill bean garden, and hung a bird feeder where I can see it from my desk. Health.com: Make time to play . OK, so the fish aren't as interesting as I'd hoped for: Watching them swim aimlessly in their small tank, in constant motion but getting absolutely nowhere, hits a little too close to home for me. But the sight of tiny leaves unfurling on the bean vines and the scent of soil filling the room when I water them have been surprisingly gratifying. As for the bird feeder? It's the best minidose of nature I've found so far. All spring I watched goldfinches and cardinals courting right outside my window. Watching them hop from branch to branch as they get their fill and move out of the way for others to feed may not be meditation, per se, but it's something similar -- a reminder that the world can offer peace and stillness, even in the midst of mayhem.

"(CNN) -- Retirement hasn't been full of lazy days, rounds of golf and luxury vacations for Gary Terry. When this former telecommunications executive called it quits after a 32-year career, he took up an equally time-consuming volunteer job as chairman of the American Heart Association's Texas chapter. Gary Terry says his being saved by a public defibrillator he'd pressed for was ""divine intervention."" ""I believe the Lord chose me to lead that group,"" said Terry, who lives in Hurst, Texas. But his ""sign from the Lord"" came, not in the form of a dream or a mysterious figure in his morning toast. Instead, it came in the form of a cardiac arrest by the security checkpoint at the Austin airport. ""I was trying to get back to the metroplex because I had a meeting the next morning. I reached down to pick up my briefcase, and I kept going."" Here's where the story takes an ironic twist: Gary Terry collapsed just 18 feet from an automated external defibrillator AED that he and his group -- the American Heart Association -- helped to install just eight months earlier. ""A lot of people say there's a lot of circumstances in your situation that really are unique,"" said Terry, ""and I say no, they're not unique circumstances -- they're divine intervention. And I truly believe that."" But the circumstances of Terry's experience are unique, because there was a defibrillator nearby, and somebody knew how to use it.  Watch more on the heart official saved by a defibrillator he pushed for » . ""When somebody stops breathing and they hit the ground, for all intents and purposes, they're dead,"" says Dr. Art Kellermann, noted defibrillator advocate and professor of emergency medicine  at Emory University. ""There are a few minutes where you can reach through the door and pull them back from death if you act decisively."" And acting decisively, says Kellermann, means following the four links in the ""chain of survival."" Visit CNNhealth, your connection for better living . The first link, according to the American Heart Association, is to recognize there's a problem, and call 911. Next, begin doing CPR, employ the use of a defibrillator and get the victim into the hands of capable medical professionals like the paramedics. ""Research has shown time and time again that you win or lose in a cardiac arrest on the scene,"" says Dr. Kellermann. ""If you don't get [the victim] started before you start transport, the likelihood they'll survive to leave the hospital is less than one-half of 1 percent."" And statistics also show that if the chain of survival is initiated within 4 minutes, the chances of survival can be as high as 60 percent. The good news is, CPR is easy to learn (local classes can be found here) and the automated external defibrillator is remarkably simple to use, even without significant training. According to several device manufacturers, you simply place the pads on a victim's chest, and turn the unit on. Complex algorithms inside the unit's computer determine whether a shock from the machine will help restart a victim's heart. Once the machine determines that a shock should in fact be delivered, it tells the user to clear their hands from the patient's body, and press the ""shock"" button. It's far less complicated than your average VCR, and almost impossible to screw up. It's for these reasons, and the relatively low cost of a defibrillator that Gary Terry continues his crusade. ""I think this is part of the plan, and I think he wants me to keep telling people what a great piece of equipment the AED is."" And Terry says he won't stop until the defibrillator is as ubiquitous in public places as a sprinkler system. ""I'm gonna try to put AEDs in every building and in every house, and then I'm gonna hang them on trees.""","Heart association official suffered cardiac arrest in a Texas airport .

"(CNN) -- Flamboyant and fearless, Roberto Cavalli is the peacock of the fashion world; with his body-hugging clothes, he woos women the world over. Fashion designer Roberto Cavalli . But his clients are no dainty damsels: Cavalli's women are Amazonian warriors and Grecian goddesses, whose armor is fashion and whose weapon is sex. His colorful creations are unabashed celebrations of the female form: dresses slashed to the hip or barely skimming the buttocks, necklines that plunge where no other designer dares. Cavalli's woman knows she looks fabulous, and isn't afraid to show it: to her, it's not just clothing, it's an announcement that she's arrived. Born in Florence in 1940, Cavalli was immersed in an intensely creative environment from childhood. That influence came from his father, a tailor, and his artist grandfather, Giuseppe Rossi, whose work is shown in the famous Uffizi Galleries. Following in his father's footsteps, Cavalli studied textile design at the local art institute. By the early 70s, he had developed an innovative technique for printing on lightweight leather, and his Florentine flair had led to commissions with Hermes and Pierre Cardin. In 1970, he presented his first namesake collection at the Salon for Prêt-à-Porter in Paris. His trademark work with unconventional fabrics like embellished denim and leather, mixed with wild animal prints and exotic patterns, was embraced by the jet set and Cavalli opened his first boutique in Saint Tropez in 1972. Cavalli married his wife, Eva Duringer, a former Miss Universe, in 1980; she is now his business partner and right-hand woman. His fondness for bright color, exotics, fur and bold prints -- which he designs in his factory on the outskirts of Florence -- have won him a name as the king of fashion excess. Beloved by A-listers and pop princesses, these are not clothes for the shy: this is old-school glamour, infused with power, wielded by women who have flounced and shimmied their way to the top.  See Cavalli's designs on the catwalk » . His main line is sold in over 50 countries worldwide, along with his diffusion lines RC Menswear and Just Cavalli, plus a children's line, knitwear, accessories, eyewear, watches, perfumes, underwear and beachwear. He's even ventured into Cavalli-branded vodka and wine. His collaboration with high-street fashion store H&M in November 2007 caused stampedes as his fans flocked to get their hands on his creations, desperate to capture some of that Cavalli magic at tiny prices. Some have asked whether his latest collections have taken a more gentle direction -- but the tiger's inner fire still burns bright. Spring/Summer 2008's bold flower prints and flirty feathered dresses were followed by Autumn/Winter 2008's flowered dresses that at first glance appear dewy and fresh -- but look closer, and the hip-hugging cut belies their innocence. Cavalli is adored by his celebrity clientele, who flaunt his show-stopping creations on red carpets from Los Angeles to Sydney. Fans of his work include Halle Berry, Sharon Stone, Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow, Beyoncè Knowles, Charlize Theron and Victoria Beckham. If anyone sums up the glamour and glitz of show business, it's Cavalli: fashion as theatre, shameless decadence where the whole world is a stage. That's underlined by his eponymous 133'9"" long yacht, built 2004, and color-coordinated, naturally, with his helicopter and fleet of cars.","Florence-born fashion designer Roberto Cavalli is known for his bright, sexy clothes .

"You could blame weeds, trees, and grasses if you start itching, sneezing, coughing, and wheezing this fall. But the usual suspects aren't the only triggers. A host of household items -- candles, chemicals, stuffed animals, and spices -- may be the real culprits. From blue jeans buttons to limes to teddybears, allergy triggers  come in many ways, shapes and forms. ""Many homes are filled with irritants, and if there's a high enough count of an irritant, you'll react,"" says Christopher Randolph, M.D., an allergy expert and professor of pediatric immunology at Yale University. Here, a rundown of 11 sneaky suspects -- and how to stop them from bothering you. Candles . You can't be allergic to essential oils -- which make candles smell like autumn leaves or dune grass -- but their odors can inflame your nasal cavities, according to James Wedner, M.D., chief of allergy and immunology at the Washington University School of Medicine. ""People with nasal allergies have a natural increased sensitivity, so they're likely to get a runny nose or watery eyes around candles,"" he says. ""To the person with the sensitive nose, it's no different than cigarette smoke."" What to do: If you're very sensitive, avoid candles altogether. But if you love the smell and want to use them at home, buy candles that have few ingredients and feature just one scent, such as pumpkin. By a process of elimination you may be able to pinpoint which scent or ingredient bothers you. (Smoke from candles can also be an irritant, though that usually comes from snuffing it out; open a window or blow out the flame outside.) If you have a bad reaction to a scented candle, getting some fresh air should make you feel better. Perfume . Fragrances can contain hundreds of chemicals that are mostly untested on humans, Wedner says. When those chemicals bond with the essential oils in perfumes and are then sprayed into the air, sensitive people may take offense. Sneezing, congestion, and headaches can be the result. What to do: Kindly ask your colleagues to go easy on their favorite fragrances, and bring a portable fan to keep your area as scent-free as possible. If the thought of not wearing a fragrance leaves you blue, stick with body creams and moisturizers that have light scents. These are less likely to irritate you. Soaps and detergents . You think it's the chemicals in cleaning products that make you itch? Surprise: ""The majority of skin sensitivities are caused not by the cleaning agent but by a perfume additive,"" Wedner says. ""And nearly every soap now has some sort of plant in it to make it fancy -- roses, elderberries, etc. The skin can respond with irritation, and give you a rash."" Read more on how to identify a rash . What to do: Buy organic or specially marked soaps; look for ""no additives,"" ""nonscented,"" or ""phthalate-free"" on the label. Phthalates are chemicals that help improve texture, but they've been linked to allergic reactions; products that contain them may have ""diethylphthalate"" or something similar on the label. Dove, Tide, and Ivory all offer low-irritant products, as do many organic brands. If fabric softener seems to be giving your skin fits, try using a sheet of aluminum foil in your dryer instead; this trick will get rid of static cling. Or use a scent-free, no-additive version, like Seventh Generation Free & Clear Natural Fabric Softener. If you're in a public laundromat, wash and dry towels first, which will soak up the residue left behind by previous users. Then be sure to use that same washer and dryer to clean and dry your clothes. Stuffed animals . Dust mites living in mattresses and pillows are a huge allergy trigger. Roughly 15 percent of the population is allergic to these microscopic bugs. Encasing mattresses and pillows with impen­etrable covers and cases is a useful step, but it's not enough. The mites also love kids' favorite furry toys. What to do: Wash, dry, then repeat ... and use very hot water. ""Toys should be washed at 140 degrees, which will ensure that the mites are killed,"" Randolph says. After they're clean store them on a shelf, not on the bed. What to do with the nonwashable toys? Every two to three weeks put them in a plastic bag in the freezer for a couple of hours, which will also kill the mites. Carpeting . You may love the feel of carpeting under your feet, but mites find it just as attractive. ""Even if you vacuum constantly, you've still got mites,"" Wedner warns. What to do: Remove wall-to-wall carpeting -- who doesn't like a beautiful wood floor? -- and use small rugs that can be washed in hot water monthly. ""And keep the humidity below 50 percent"" with your central air system or a dehumidifier, Randolph says. ""Dust mites thrive in humidity."" Read more on how to allergy-proof your house . Spices . They add nuance and zing to a variety of dishes, but there's no getting around spices' origin: pungent plants. For some people, eating the spices made from these plants leads to a just little sniffling. For others, it may cause itching, swelling, and even burning of the lips. What to do: Avoid the spices more likely to cause trouble: coriander, poppy seeds, pepper, dill, paprika, cumin, and saffron -- which, in broad strokes, means Indian and Middle Eastern food. If you're not sure which spices bother you, record what you've been exposed to each time you have symptoms and look for the common denominator. Need help planning an allergen-free Halloween? Read on for some tips . Christmas trees . A word to the wise before the holidays: Mold grows fast on Christmas trees. ""When you put that tree in a bucket of water, invisible mold grows almost immediately,"" Wedner says. ""Most people are allergic to or irritated by mold spores."" What to do: Try a fake tree. Can't live without a real one? Ask when it was cut down before you buy it; trees that were cut weeks in advance are already ripe with mold. Then, starve it of water and keep it for as short a period as possible. Mold grows on houseplants, too, so keep them on the dry side. Wall paint . The solvents and synthetic resins used in paint often lead to itchy eyes and headaches. Oil-based paints are a particular problem because they can continue releasing chemicals even after they dry. What to do: Keep windows open as often as possible and allow fresh air to circulate for four weeks after painting, no matter what kind of paint you use. ""Once it has dried -- and I mean really dried, weeks later -- the odor goes away, and you won't have a problem,"" Wedner says. If possible, use latex paint, which emits less gas than oil-based kinds due to its water base. By the way, there isn't any real latex in latex paint, so if you're allergic to latex gloves the same won't apply to the paint. What about paint with low levels of VOCs (volatile organic compounds)? They spew fewer chemicals into the air and are less smelly than regular paints. But that doesn't mean they won't bother you. To find these paints, look for the ""Green Seal"" certification mark on the label. Alcohol . An actual allergy to alcohol is quite rare, but being allergic to the grains and additives used in liquor is not: wheat or the preservative sulfur dioxide could cause a rash or a stuffy nose. New York City allergist Wellington Tichenor, MD, founder of the information site Sinuses.com, also blames grains like corn, bar­ley, and rye, as well as fruit flavorings. Wine and beer may create problems, too. What to do: Stick with grain-free liquors like potato vodka, rum (made from sugar), and tequila (the agave plant). Skip all flavored liquers. And if sulfite preservatives in wine bother you, red wine tends to have fewer preservatives than white. Also, look for wine labeled ""sulfite-free"" (it won't stay fresh for long). And remember that anything with carbonation (like a wine cooler) increases the likelihood of an allergic reaction, Tichenor adds. Blue jeans buttons . The buttons on your jeans are probably made with the metal nickel -- a rash trigger for up to 20 percent of women. A nickel rash near your waistline is usually itchy, red, and sometimes blistery. What to do: Take your pants to a tailor and have her replace the nickel buttons with plastic ones (another metal might also cause irritation). A second option: Coat the button with clear nail polish, a remedy found to be effective in a recent St. Louis University study. Just be aware that nail polish itself may lead to a rash if you're sensitive to it. Lemons and limes . Limonene, a zesty compound in lime and other citrus fruits, gives many people watery eyes and a burning sensation in the nose, Wedner says. It might even irritate your skin, whether you touch it or eat or drink products containing limonene. What to do: If you get a rash, treat it with topical hydrocortisone creams used for bug bites and poison ivy. Skip the lemon or lime wedge with your drink or salad, and look out for lime in salad dressings, desserts, and marinades (it's used in numerous dishes).

"Bakuriani, Georgia (CNN) -- The 21-year-old Georgian luger who propelled to his death after sliding off the track during an Olympic practice run in Vancouver was laid to rest in his hometown Saturday. Some 4,000 citizens from every walk of life mourned silently as Nodar Kumaritashvili was buried in his hometown of Bakuriani. The mourners included President Mikhail Saakashvili, who was clad in a Georgian Olympics shirt to show his national solidarity. ""I wanted to throw a wedding feast for you,"" the athlete's father, David Kumaritashvili, said in a eulogy. ""Instead we have a funeral."" Kumaritashvili died during a practice run when he slammed into a steel pole near the end of the 4,500-foot-long course and was propelled off the track, according to the International Olympics Committee. A preliminary inquiry said human error caused the accident because he came out of a turn too late. But Nodar's family and many Georgians don't accept that explanation. There had been concerns from athletes about the speed of the record-setting track at the Whistler Sliding Center in Vancouver ahead of the opening of the 2010 Winter Olympics, according to a Georgian official. ""There were some questions asked by other athletes even before this tragic accident,"" said Nikolas Rurua, Georgia's deputy minister for culture and sports, adding that there had been several crashes in the same area. ""But at this moment it would be premature for me to jump to any conclusions."" Video of the crash shows Kumaritashvili lying motionless after being thrown from his sled and striking the pole when he was coming out of the course's last turn. He was given cardio-pulmonary resuscitation by medical staff on site before being transported to a hospital where doctors were unable to revive him, the IOC said. The luge is often called the ""fastest sport on ice."" Sliders use their legs and shoulders to steer small fiberglass sleds down an icy track, at times approaching or surpassing speeds of 90 mph, according to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics Web site. They are positioned on their backs with their feet straight out in front of them and their heads back to be as aerodynamic as possible. A track speed record -- and world speed record -- was recorded at Whistler on February 21, 2009, when a single men's luge athlete, Germany's Felix Loch, topped 95 mph during competition. American luger Tony Benshoof held the previous world speed record of 86.8 mph set in 2001. A somber seven-member Georgian delegation wore black armbands to the February 12 opening ceremonies, and a black ribbon was tied atop the Georgian flag in tribute to Kumaritashvili. The team received a standing ovation from the 60,000 spectators in attendance. Kumaritashvili's death was the first time an athlete had been killed during the games since 1992, when a Swiss skier crashed into a snow-clearing machine on a public trail while training in the closing days of the games, according to NBC News, the official broadcaster of the Vancouver Games. Journalist Eka Kadagishvili contributed to this report.","Nodar Kumaritashvili killed during Olympics practice run in Vancouver .

"(CNN) -- A recent study on global wellbeing showed the Danes to be the happiest people on the planet and with about a fifth of them living in their capital it stands to reason that Copenhagen must be a little bit special. The Amalienborg palaces are the royal family's winter residence. So what are they so happy about? Well, lifestyle magazine Monocle recently named Copenhagen as being the world's most livable city, highlighting the quality of its infrastructure, transport system and contemporary buildings. It's true that the city is well planned and well managed; it boasts a new metro system, the main arteries in the centre are pedestrianized and the other streets are filled with cyclists rather than exhaust fumes. But Copenhagen is not some soulless exercise in sterile urban planning. There are the winding medieval streets of Indre By and the Latin Quarter, the picture-postcard houses of Nyhavn, the canals of Christanshavn, and the palaces and parks of Fredericksstaden and Rosenborg. The city is, simply, charming. If you spend some time in Copenhagen you'll quickly come to understand the Danish concept of ""hygge"", a word with multiple meanings that is best translated as something between ""cozy"" and ""relaxed"". But if that suggests a city of bygone cuteness it doesn't take into account the sleek modernism of Danish design. Arne Jacobsen's legacy can be seen throughout the city (check out the Radisson SAS Royal and Café Stelling) but no less visionary are recent structures such as Henning Larsen's futuristic Opera House or the dramatic new Royal Library, known as the ""Black Diamond"". The clean lines and minimalism that characterize Danish design are evident in the interiors of the city's stylish bars, restaurants and hotels and perhaps their influence can even be detected in the trend away from bland, stodgy cooking to a cleaner, healthier style that is earning the city's restaurants acclaim and Michelin stars. The alternative side of Copenhagen can be seen in places like Christiania, the 'free city' founded in 1971 by a collection of dropouts, hippies and social visionaries. The fact that this semi-autonomous experiment in communal living has survived for so long is testament to the open-mindedness of the Danish; but the very existence of Christiania has always been controversial and government plans to 'normalize' the area suggest it may not be 'free' much longer. Like any city of its size, Copenhagen has its share of social problems. Nørrebro has been the scene of a riots in recent years, with some commentators blaming social deprivation and others blaming boredom among young people. But it is working class areas like Nørrebro and Vesterbro, away from the tourist trail, that are the beating heart of the city. They are home to many of Copenhagen's trendiest bars and clubs and they have a sense of community that is difficult to convey; it is something Danes might describe as ""hygge"". So why are the Danish so happy? Go to Copenhagen and you'll understand.","Copenhagen has been described as the world's most livable city .
The city is charming, with medieval streets, canals and royal palaces .
Sleek Danish design is evident everywhere and gives the city a modern edge .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- One revolutionized women's hair in the 1960s. Another brought fear to Middle Earth. Another is a champion golfer who now designs courses all over the world. Christopher Lee is famous for playing Count Dracula and his roles in ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" films. Vidal Sassoon, Christopher Lee and Nick Faldo are among those recognized this year on Queen Elizabeth's birthday honors list. Lee and Faldo will both receive knighthoods, meaning they can now be known as ""Sir Christopher"" and ""Sir Nick."" Lee, 87, is famous for his portrayal of dark villains, starting with Count Dracula in a series of movies from the late 1950s until the 1970s. He gained a new generation of fans in in the past decade through is role as the bad wizard Saruman the White in the the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and as the evil Count Dooku in two ""Star Wars"" prequels. World-famous golfer Nick Faldo holds six major championship titles -- three from the British Open and three from the Masters. He has the record for the longest streak of majors played -- 48 -- dating to the 1987 British Open, according to the PGA Tour. Faldo is now almost as famous for designing golf courses as he is for playing the sport. He also serves as a television commentator. A knighthood is the highest honor, and recipients may use the title ""Sir"" before their names. The equivalent for women is to be awarded the title of ""Dame."" They recognize a ""pre-eminent contribution"" in any field. Next come CBEs, or Commanders of the Order of the British Empire, which recognize contribution to a slightly lesser degree. Recipients may not use the title of sir or dame but may use the initials after their names. Sassoon will be awarded a CBE for his services to the British hairdressing industry. It recognizes a lifetime of achievement for Sassoon, who as a young boy spent years in a London orphanage after his father left and his mother could not afford to care for him. Later, after his mother dreamed of her son being in a barber shop, she apprenticed him to a local barber. That began a career that saw him develop two classic hairstyles of the Sixties -- the Bob and the even shorter Five-Point Cut -- along with an eponymous hair care line, range of hair care tools, and chain of salons. Also receiving a CBE is Jonathan Pryce, a Golden Globe-nominated actor who has had roles in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies, ""Ronin,"" and the James Bond film ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" He won a best actor award in 1995 at Cannes for his part in the movie ""Carrington."" Actor Alan Cumming will receive an OBE, or Order of the British Empire, awarded for notable achievement in any field. He was recognized for ""services to film, theater and the arts and to activism for equal rights for the gay and lesbian community."" A large number of artists and others in creative fields are featured on this year's list. Andrew Motion, who was Britain's poet laureate until he stepped down this year, will receive a knighthood, and several names in fashion will also receive awards. Fashion designer Jeff Banks will receive a CBE; Frances Marie Corner, the head of the London College of Fashion, will receive an OBE; and MBEs will go to Christopher Bailey, the creative director at Burberry, and Natalie Massenet, the founder of online designer shopping site Net-a-Porter. Honors lists are published twice a year -- once on New Year's Day and once in June, to mark the queen's ""official"" birthday. The queen's actual birthday is in April but she celebrates it in June because the weather is better.","Hairdresser Vidal Sassoon, golfer Nick Faldo honored by UK's queen .

"(CNN) -- Once again, thanks to everyone who made connections between Canada and the Ivory Coast. We were quite amazed at the links you found between two countries that at first glance appear to be worlds apart. We started the week by talking to Lonely Planet editor Tom Hall . He told CNN's Max Foster that one of the most interesting links is that both countries have brilliant borders. Canada's border with the United States is the longest land border in the world, Hall said. Meanwhile the Ivory Coast, which has five countries neighboring it and a sea coast, has a most unusual border. Ailish Coblentz in Toronto made another interesting point related to borders. The populations of both countries live near the periphery. Most Canadians live near the U.S. border, and likewise citizens in the Ivory Coast live around the edges. ""Jose Nagbe,"" like many of you, noted that a shared French heritage links Canada and the Ivory Coast. ""Philip Ideh"" connected the two countries by pointing out that both countries have great monuments. The Ivory Coast, for instance, has the largest church in the world. Ziebono Nagbe also linked the two countries by religion, saying that there are sizeable Catholic populations in both Canada and the Ivory Coast. We also interviewed Canadian author Yann Martel, the Booker Prize-winning author of ""Life of Pi."" He told us about how Canada inspires and shapes his work. There were two main food-related connections that many made. ""Curt,"" a commenter on the blog, said the Ivory Coast is a major producer of coffee, and Canadians love coffee. Bob Nelmes pointed out that the Ivory Coast produces loads of cocoa -- and that Canadians love drinking hot chocolate, especially during the wintertime. We also took a closer look at the the cocoa industry in the Ivory Coast, highlighting some of the challenges farmers there face. ""Linda Sampson"" used sports fans to connect the two countries. Canadian fans of ice hockey and Ivorian soccer fans are both ""crazy and dedicated,"" she wrote on the blog. Please keep sending us your comments. The next set of countries we're looking at is Turkey and China. Check out our quiz to see how much you know about these two countries, and if you make any links, leave us a message on the blog. As usual, we'll investigate the best on Connect the World. Happy connecting!","We highlight the links you made between Canada and the Ivory Coast .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Punctuation promises comedy in ""The Informant!"" as if the title subject is a cartoon secret agent -- maybe Agent 86 in ""Get Smart."" Matt Damon, as a corporate turncoat, offers up secrets in ""The Informant!"" But he's not. The whistle-blower worthy of an exclamation point in this groovy-looking, chuckle-baiting, fact-based movie from protean director Steven Soderbergh is Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon), a biochemist and well-placed executive at the agri-processing giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) in Decatur, Illinois. It's the early 1990s. The company man is helping expose ADM's alleged global price-fixing activities to the FBI, cooperating with the feds long enough to gather invaluable evidence. But what Whitacre doesn't confide to his FBI handlers, and what his wheat-colored jackets, Dilbert ties, and weakling mustache hide, at least at first, is that this inside source is not completely trustworthy. Damon, fattened up to fit his boxy suits, wears Whitacre's slack demeanor beautifully. The star -- who has quietly and steadily turned into a great Everyman actor -- is in nimble control as he reveals his character's deep crazies.  Watch why Damon gained 30 pounds for the role » . Soderbergh's amused study of the highest-ranking corporate whistleblower in U.S. history is adapted from ""The Informant: A True Story,"" an amazing, deeply reported book by New York Times reporter Kurt Eichenwald. That book told the story without editorial eye-rolling. But somewhere between Eichenwald's journalistic attention to detail and the bubbly, dialogue-besotted script by ""The Bourne Ultimatum's"" Scott Z. Burns, Soderbergh has chosen to apply an attitude of arch whoopee, a greasy veneer of mirth over what is, no joke, a serious mess of malfeasance and mental instability. It's tempting to laugh, but what's the joke: Whitacre? ADM? The FBI? The fashion trends of Decatur? Smarty condescension lurks behind the suburban bushes. Had a '90s date and place card not been supplied, I would have remained in an honest muddle about the era depicted on screen. And since Whitacre is subliminally likened to bumbling, fictional Maxwell Smart, that's probably as the filmmaker intended. The artistic choice is reinforced by a '70s-era ""Laugh-In"" aesthetic seen in everything from the smiley yellow novelty typography of the opening credits to the fancy rubber-chicken music served up in heaps of horns and whistles by essence-of-'70s composer Marvin Hamlisch. Sock it to me. Playing it straight and letting his Sam-Donaldson-meets-Spock hairdo suggest otherwise, Scott Bakula makes an appealing FBI agent with a deadpan grimace just this side -- or maybe it's the other side -- of ""Dragnet's"" Joe Friday. Comedian Joel McHale from E!'s ""The Soup"" plays the fellow agent who stares with big round eyes while his partner squints at Whitacre's successive leakages of truth/lie/ truth/lie. The always wonderful, huggable Melanie Lynskey, who stole the show in ""Away We Go,"" does more great wifely work as Ginger Whitacre, her husband's biggest booster. A valued subset of Soderbergh's audience is sure to dig iconic hipster comic brothers Tom and Dick Smothers in small roles. In fact, the wily pair would fit right in with an ""Ocean's Whatever"" cast of coolios, enjoying some retro-style ensemble fun, regardless of whether the audience does. Soderbergh is as smart, stylish, and attentive a filmmaker as they come. And there are moments in ""The Informant!"" when I can almost be convinced that the tonal feints he establishes at the intersection of joke and no-joke are seriously, thoughtfully meant to replicate the misaligned synapses in Whitacre's own head. iReport.com: Damon's latest worth checking out . But if that's the intention, Soderbergh ultimately made the choice to abandon interesting, dispassionate empathy for the more quick-fix payoff of amusement. As Whitacre goes through his days, Damon recites interior monologues of distracted observation in voice-overs meant to demonstrate how his character's unusual brain works. In ""The Informant!"", that brain -- screwy and yet capable of doing important undercover work -- free-associates like Ellen DeGeneres on a swing through Walmart. Cute, but as even Agent 86 would say in ""Get Smart"": Missed it by that much. EW Grade: B . CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

"(CNN) -- A strengthening El Nino is expected to bring torrential rain Thursday to parts of Southern California, including Los Angeles, and authorities warned of possibly severe mudslides in areas denuded by forest fires. The storm could dump 8 inches to 10 inches of rain on the Los Angeles area and higher amounts in the foothills, the National Weather Service said. Late Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa -- expecting a dangerous storm Wednesday -- urged hundreds of Californians to leave their homes. A torrential rainfall Tuesday unleashed flooding and spawned a rare tornado warning.  Are you being affected by the storms? Send your images, video . There has been some resistance to the advice, a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department said. The detective, who wouldn't give her entire name, said she didn't know how many people decided to leave.  Flash flooding on California golf course . There was heavy rain Wednesday in San Francisco and Sacramento, California, but Los Angeles had little precipitation as of about noon.  Driving by homes, businesses under water . A warm ocean current from the South Pacific is responsible for this week's storms, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. With little vegetation to help contain the water, the vast expanses in southern California that were hit by wildfires late last summer are causing concern for officials. The largest of the fires -- known as the Station Fire -- charred 250 square miles of land last summer north and east of Los Angeles. ""If you are lower in elevation than where a fire happened earlier this year, you need to be very, very cautious,"" Myers said. Forecasters said several feet of snow would fall in the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada through the rest of this week, as low pressure systems continue moving into the area.","El Nino expected to bring torrential rain Thursday to parts of Southern California .

"(CNN) -- Tanya Gray, 28, works at a preschool in Florence, where she has lived for the last two years. She first moved to the city seven years ago from her home in Luxemburg, when she and a friend decided to travel to Italy's cultural capital to enroll as students. ""Once you have seen the Duomo and some of the old buildings you can't really compare it to anywhere else."" While there she fell in love, and over the following years she was either in the city or planning her next trip there. CNN: Hi Tanya. What were your initial impressions on coming to Florence? Tanya: It's a very beautiful city, it's very young and there are always things to do: there's always a party; there's always something going on. And that was very different from Luxemburg for me -- Luxemburg is a very small place and there's not much going on, but in Florence there is so much energy. I was expecting something a lot more like Rome, a lot bigger. Florence is one of those places that is not too big, but it's still a city, so wherever you go you meet different people, it's not that everyone knows everything about you. But it's small enough so that you can walk everywhere. I don't have a car, and walk everywhere. I have been totally immersed in the Florentine way of life: I'm married to a Florentine, I spend all my time with his friends. I didn't even know there was an English-language newspaper in Florence until very recently. CNN: What has made the city so special to you? Tanya: That would have to be all the historic buildings and the architecture, because once you have seen the Duomo and some of the old buildings you can't really compare it to anywhere else. When you see the Duomo, it's breathtaking. And there are various places in the city, such as the Piazzale Michelangelo, from where you can see the whole of the city, and it's beautiful. You can just spend ages there, especially if you are an art enthusiast. CNN: If Florence were a person, what would they be like? Tanya: They would be a really fun, enthusiastic, very lively and cheerful person. CNN: Is Florence a stylish place? Tanya: Yes, of course. All the Italians kit themselves out when they go around the center of Florence, everyone is wearing the latest fashion -- even the mothers of 50- and 60-years old have all got them. You get taken along with the current, even though in the beginning you think, ""No, I'm not going to be like them, I'm not."" But in the end you just get taken along with the flow. Otherwise you just feel underdressed. A lot of American students who come to Florence -- and there are lots and lots of students in the center, most of whom are American -- are a lot less dressy than the Italians, and the Italians can spot them a mile away. CNN: Is it hard to find places away from the tourists? Tanya: Oh no. The center is very touristy, but if you travel about a kilometer outside of the center it is actually hard to find someone to who speaks English. I live about three kilometers from the center of the city and round there it's really tough to find someone who speaks English. You walk into a bakery and everything has to be said in Italian. Also, some of the clubs 10 minutes' drive from the center are a lot less touristy than the clubs in the center. CNN: Where do you shop? Tanya: Obviously there are lots of shops in the city, but there are also lots of markets, and many people shop at them. I definitely shop at markets because the shops in town are so much more expensive, especially for clothes. And they're not just in the center, they're also on the outskirts as well, which tend to be cheaper, because the ones in the center can rip you off if you're a tourist, or if you look like one. CNN: Could you describe a typical Florentine's weekend? Tanya: On Saturday morning they would go for a walk into town and have a look at all the shops in the center. And then the Italians are very fond of aperitifs before they go out, and lots of the bars have these aperitifs put out. One of the bars in town is called Slowly and a lot of people go there and have their cocktail and their little things to eat, sausage rolls, crisps and all the different little things. Then they would go onto a club, a really good one is called Otel, it's in the south of Florence, a ten minute drive from the center, and it's a really nice club. You can have dinner, watch a show with comedians, live singing and dancing, and then it turns into a club after about 12.30. On Sundays, lots of the Italian people, if it's nice weather, like to go for a drive in the Chianti region: it's beautiful. They might stop for lunch in one of these very quaint little restaurants. If it's terrible weather they can go to the big shopping center, which is called Gilli. Sunday nights are very popular nights to have an aperitif, as well. It's a big student town, and Thursday night is a big night to go out as well. Well, in the city center any night you can find people going out. There is constantly something going on. .................................. Where have you found the ""real"" Florence? Do you agree with Tanya?

"Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Soledad O'Brien tells users about her work with young people who videotaped their stories in post-Katrina New Orleans. From left: Shantia Reneau, Deshawn Dabney, Soledad O'Brien, Amanda Hill and Brandon Franklin. NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- Eighteen-year-old Amanda Hill sits on a plastic lawn chair in a gutted home, talking straight into a camera. She looks shell-shocked, as if she has survived a war, and in a way that is exactly what has happened. Amanda and her grandmother lost their home and their livelihood as a result of Hurricane Katrina. ""I know what it is like not to have the finer things in life,"" she says, ""and I don't need that to be happy, but I wake up at 3 a.m. to hearing my grandma crying because she doesn't know if she'll have money to put milk in the fridge or bread on the table.""  Watch Amanda's story . Amanda speaks these words on the very first tape she sends to us in February of this year. She is one of 11 New Orleans-area students, age 12 to 20, who received cameras from me and filmmaker Spike Lee in January. Their mission: Take the cameras and tell us the story of your post-Katrina lives. For instance, Amanda tells us her grandmother, Dolores, has mentioned suicide. ""All I could say was it's going to be OK, when in my heart I don't think it is."" Dolores has raised Amanda since she was 11 years old. That was the year her mother died from cancer. Since returning to St. Bernard Parish, east of New Orleans, Dolores has tried to support the two of them while working at McDonald's. In early spring, 15-year-old Deshawn Dabney confides to his camera, ""I don't want to be dead at 15. I have dreams, a whole life to live. I want to be this huge entertainer... and there is no way I can do that if I'm dead."" He has reason to be concerned. He is speaking just days after a neighbor, 17-year-old Anthony Placide, was killed by a gunshot wound to the head. The shooting happened only a few hundred feet from Deshawn's front door.   Watch Deshawn's story . On another tape we get a few days later, Deshawn is interviewing Anthony's 14-year-old brother, Jamell Hurst. ""I was shocked,"" Jamell tells Deshawn about his brother's murder. By now, I'm a bit shocked too, by the emotions these kids are sharing on these tapes. Seventeen-year-old Shantia Reneau talks about her inability to afford the college of her dreams, Southeastern Louisiana University. All of the family's extra money is going toward rebuilding their damaged home in the 9th Ward. They're living in a FEMA trailer in a parking lot. ""I really want to go to Southeastern, but if not, I'll have to stay down here,"" she says while walking along her damaged street. ""I didn't want to. New Orleans has nothing to offer, nothing, not a thing.""  Watch Shantia's story . Nineteen-year-old Brandon Franklin is looking outside New Orleans, too. He wants to go away to college to study to become a band director. But it may be a tough road for him. He is raising a 1-year-old with his live-in girlfriend, Ivorionne, and they have another baby on the way. ""I feel like we're a little bit too young for the responsibilities we have,"" he tells the camera in a strong, confident voice. ""But I feel like I can do anything I put my mind to."" Seeing and hearing him, you want to believe it.   Watch Brandon's story . Amanda, Deshawn, Shantia and Brandon are among the approximately 30,000 students who attend public schools in Orleans and St. Bernard Parish nearly two years after the storm, down from more than 75,000 before Katrina hit. On the day we distributed the cameras, Spike Lee told the kids to ""just go out and shoot, tape is cheap.""

"Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the ""forgotten floor,"" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the ""forgotten floor."" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually ""avoidable felonies."" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. ""I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!"" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered ""lunatics"" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the ""forgotten floor""  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served.

"(CNN) -- Federal investigators have found salmonella bacteria in chicken feed and in barn and walkway areas at Iowa farms at the center of the nationwide outbreak, officials said. The feed or feed ingredients could have become contaminated after they went through heat treatment that was sufficient to kill salmonella, officials from the Food and Drug Administration told reporters. Produced at a mill at a Wright County Egg Co. facility, the feed was given to pullet chickens at both Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms, which between them recalled more than a half-billion eggs since the salmonella outbreak. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a total of 2,403 cases of Salmonella enteriditis had been reported in the United States between May 1 and August 25. Normally, 933 cases would be reported in that time period. The dramatic difference of 1,470 cases may be linked, at least in part, to the outbreak and the tainted eggs, a CDC spokeswoman said. Officials indicated in a conference call that this is the largest Salmonella enteriditis outbreak since tracking began in the mid-1970s. Testing at Wright County Egg farms in Iowa showed the presence of salmonella in the food mill and in manure at two locations, said Sherri McGarry of the Food and Drug Administration. She said investigators are still drawing samples at Hillandale Farms. ''Feed were the sources [of the salmonella], but perhaps not the only sources,"" McGarry said. The feed could have been contaminated in a number of ways, including by birds, rodents and people's shoes or boots, officials said. Wright County Egg, in a statement issued later Thursday, said it will ""work with FDA as they expand their review of feed ingredients purchased from outside vendors for our farm, as well as for their ongoing review of our farms."" ""FDA while on our farm tested meat and bone meal that is provided by a third-party supplier as an ingredient for our feed. The ingredient is held separately in an overhead bin that was tested by FDA officials prior to being mixed in with our feed. ""This finding obviously is of great concern to us. As part of our internal investigation and in response to FDA's initial consideration of feed as a possible source, on August 23 we pulled and sent samples of all ingredients used in our feed for further SE [Salmonella enteriditis] testing. In addition, today we provided FDA with information about our third-party supplier and immediately notified that supplier of the testing results. ... ""We have received from FDA three positive environmental SE tests. It's important to understand that a positive environmental test does not mean eggs from that barn would have SE."" Wright County Egg spokeswoman Hinda Mitchell said the third-party supplier and manufacturer is Central Bi-Products. A call to the company was not immediately returned Thursday night. Thursday's update by federal regulators came amid rising questions of how the companies monitored their facilities and the speed of the government response. Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, announced a House subcommittee will hold hearings September 14 on the safety of the nation's food supply. The subcommittee has requested inspection reports and notices of any violations, among other documents, from Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms. ""We are working right now to respond to the Committee, and we will approach it in the same forthright manner as we have in our cooperation with FDA to date,"" said Mitchell, confirming that owner Jack DeCoster has been invited to appear. Hillandale Farms founder Orland Bethel also has been asked to attend, said spokeswoman Julie DeYoung, who likewise said the company is cooperating with officials. Dr. Jeff Farrar, the associate commissioner for food safety at the FDA, said it took weeks to trace the clusters of salmonella reports to contaminated eggs. Officials didn't believe a massive early recall made sense, nor did they want to wait for confirmed laboratory results, he said. ""We have to strike a balance between being timely and accurate,"" Farrar said of the FDA's move August 11 to ask the companies to do a voluntary recall. Iowa does not have an egg quality assurance program, McGarry said. ""We are not sure how and when this feed could have been contaminated,"" she said. FDA officials said new producer egg safety rules, which took effect in July after the outbreak began, will greatly reduce the possibility of a similar salmonella outbreak in the future. More people are likely to report becoming sick because of the two to three weeks it takes for salmonella to manifest itself, said Dr. Christopher R. Braden, acting director of the Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases at the CDC. No deaths have been linked to the outbreak, regulators said. Braden said elderly people living in nursing homes have not fallen sick, as they might have in past outbreaks. Increased egg safety procedures in restaurants, along with pasteurization and thorough cooking, have put a dent into the outbreak, he added. Egg consumers had two new brand names to search for in their refrigerators. Wright County Egg, which was responsible for 380 million of the 550 million recalled eggs, said 60-egg cases sold under the Cardenas Market brand in California and Nevada were being recalled.  Eggs included in the recall are labeled with plant number 1026 and date codes ranging from 136 to 228. Dates and codes can be found printed on the label. The plant number begins with the letter P and then the number.  The Julian date follows the plant number, for example:  P-1026 228. In addition, Trafficanda Egg Ranch released a statement saying it was doing a voluntary recall of Wright County-supplied shell eggs. The Trafficanda Egg Ranch-branded eggs were distributed to grocery stores and food-service companies in California in 12-egg cartons, 20-egg over-wrapped packages, and 60-egg over-wrapped packages with date codes ranging from 136 to 229 and plant numbers 1026, 1413, 1720, 1942 and 1946. According to a spokeswoman for the Egg Safety Center, the two newest ""subrecalls"" don't add to the total number of eggs recalled; both the Cardenas Market and Trafficanda Egg Ranch eggs were counted already as part of Wright County Egg's 380 million. New regulations went into effect July 9 requiring egg producers with more than 3,000 hens to take measures designed to prevent the spread of salmonella. While FDA inspectors typically didn't inspect farms until after an outbreak of illness, Farrar, the associate commissioner for food safety at the FDA, said that under the new rule, ""We will be beginning routine inspections of egg farms throughout the United States."" While the recall involves hundreds of millions of eggs, they represent less than 1 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the United States each year, said Krista Eberle, director of the food safety program at the Egg Safety Center. But even that risk level is too high for some restaurant patrons in Michigan, the most recently added state on the list of those receiving tainted eggs. ""It makes you not even want to order or buy the eggs,"" Audrey Karas, a customer at a Big Boy in Warren, Michigan, told CNN affiliate WDIV. Big Boy uses eggs unaffected by the recall. ""It makes you uneasy about buying eggs, even if they are supposed to be safe."" CNN's Phil Gast and Senior Medical Producer Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report.","Wright County Egg issues statement mentioning outside vendors .

"(CNN) --   The love-triangles, family feuds and paternity mysteries of Brazil's telenovelas have commandeered the nation's airwaves for decades and generated a fortune for Globo -- the powerful TV network that produces many of the genre's most popular shows. Brazilian actress Carolina Dieckmann's portrayal of life with lukemia prompted 23,000 marrow donations after the show was aired. But aside from lining the pockets of television executives, evidence is emerging that the telenovelas have had a surprising impact on the fabric of Brazilian society. From declining fertility rates and a growing proportion of divorcees, to an increasing awareness of social issues and taboo medical conditions -- it is claimed that the colorful dramas are responsible for a wave of 'social merchandising' that has helped significantly alter Brazilian values over the years. Despite a religious culture that condemns modern family planning methods, birth rates in Brazil have decreased from 6.3 children per woman in 1963 to 2.3 in 2000. This drop is of a similar scale to that seen in China, where the government has played an extensive and controversial role in controlling population numbers. Although such a change could be attributed to a range of factors, a new study reveals that there is a direct correlation between the availability of the Globo TV signal and low fertility rates across Brazil. This is accompanied by a similar pattern of increasing divorce rates, as well as the (albeit less remarkable) tendency for parents to name their children after popular characters. Novelas depict the ""small, healthy, urban, middle and upper-class consumerist family,"" says Alberto Chong, one of the study's authors. ""They have been a powerful medium through which the small family has been idealized."" The changing trends certainly resonate with an analysis of 115 Globo novelas aired between 1965 and 1999. It showed that 72 percent of the main female characters had no children, and 21 percent had only one child. The influence of TV is particularly strong in countries like Brazil. Joseph Potter, a University of Texas sociologist who has studied the relationship between fertility and television in Brazil explains in a report: ""It's not a literate society, it's not a place where there are books and newspapers outside the upper 10 percent -- and television fills that space."" But as well as fashioning lifestyle choices, the novelas contribute to an increasing awareness and tolerance of difficult social issues. Bruno Gagliasso is the star of one of the most popular novelas in Brazil. In it he plays Tarzo, a recently diagnosed schizophrenic fighting not only himself but the stigmas of mental illness. ""We're showing a disease that people ignore,"" he tells CNN. ""And we're able to expose it to society as a whole."" Finding opportunities to insert health themes into novelas is described by some in the industry as 'social merchandising' and its effects are quantifiably real. Globo executive Luis Erlanger says that one episode, which featured a young girl in tears as her head is shaved in preparation for chemotherapy, prompted 23,000 bone marrow donations in the month after it first aired. Despite this, Erlanger is quick to assert that Globo's priority is always with entertainment and that social issues will never dictate plot. However Manoel Carlos, writer of novelas since 1978, sees the inclusion of health themes and information as a personal responsibility. ""Novelas are used to sell cars and freezers,"" he tells CNN. ""So why not sell some good information?""","Soap operas, known as telenovelas, encourage smaller families study finds .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) --   An advisory panel is recommending a major step up in protection for health workers dealing with patients suspected or confirmed to have H1N1 influenza. One expert says that based on current knowledge, N95 respirators offer health workers the best protection. The Institute of Medicine said Thursday, in recommendations requested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that loose paper masks are inadequate because the workers could still breathe in the virus. Instead, health workers should switch to N95 respirators that form an airtight seal around the nose and mouth. If properly fitted and worn correctly, N95 respirators filter out at least 95 percent of particles as small as 0.3 micrometers, which is smaller than influenza viruses, the report notes. The institute provides independent, evidence-based advice to policymakers, health professionals, private entities and the public. It is one of four groups that make up the National Academies. The study released Thursday was requested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. ""Scientists do not know to what extent flu viruses spread through the air or whether infection requires physical contact with contaminated fluids or surfaces,"" a summary of the report says. It calls for ""a boost in research to answer these questions and to design and develop better protective equipment that would enhance workers' comfort, safety and ability to do their jobs."" ""Based on what we currently know about influenza, well-fitted N95 respirators offer health care workers the best protection against inhalation of viral particles,"" said committee chairman Kenneth Shine, executive vice chancellor for health affairs at the University of Texas in Austin. He is a former president of the institute. ""But there is a lot we still don't know about these viruses, and it would be a mistake for anyone to rely on respirators alone as some sort of magic shield."" Health care workers should use several strategies to guard against infection, such as innovative triage processes, washing hands, disinfecting, wearing gloves, getting vaccinated and using antiviral drugs, Shine said. The institute was asked specifically to evaluate personal protective equipment designed to guard against respiratory infection, and therefore the committee focused on the efficacy of medical masks and respirators.","Panel recommends health care workers wear N95 respirators for H1N1 patients .

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- ""Always you have to run for your life,"" says Boo Htoo, who grew up in a refugee camp in Thailand just across the border from Myanmar. Boo Htoo and his family lived at the Maela Refugee Camp before being resettled in Phoenix, Arizona. Ethnic minorities still flee the repressive military regime in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Some 111,000 Myanmar refugees live in nine camps in Thailand, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Htoo, now 29, recalls making the long trek with his parents to cross the border when he was about 5. ""[It's] a very long way,"" he says. ""We don't have a car, a plane. We don't have a bicycle to ride. My parents just take what they can carry, and then we started walking across the jungle, sleeping in the jungle."" Htoo and his family are now resettled in Phoenix, Arizona. Thanks to Carolyn Manning and her Welcome to America Project, they got a warm welcome to the big city, complete with furnishings and household items for their first apartment and toys for his two young children. ""That day that I have a lot of American friends in my apartment,"" recalls Htoo, ""this is the day that I feel very happy."" For Htoo, it was a remarkable transition from ""a really hard life in the refugee camp."" ""They have a wire fence around the camp; they put soldiers around the fence,"" Htoo says. ""You are not allowed to go outside to work. You don't have a chance to go to university even if you are willing to go. I cannot express the feeling of how difficult it is.""

Since 2001, she and volunteers have provided furniture, clothing and support to more than 550 refugee families. Nominate your Hero at CNN.com/Heroes . The first family Manning welcomed came to her attention in a local newspaper. Manning's brother-in-law Terence had died in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York. The family in the newspaper was from Afghanistan and had lost a relative to the Taliban. Manning immediately saw a parallel. ""Knowing that Terence was killed innocently and then seeing the Afghan family who had someone killed in their family, I started to make a connection between myself and that family,"" Manning recalls. ""We lost a family member, too. The difference was we had a safe place that we lived -- and they had to flee their country."" At a time when many Americans were putting up walls and shunning foreigners, Manning reached out to them. She and her family took up a collection of furniture for them -- and The Welcome to America Project was born. ""They've been invited here,"" says Manning. ""Everybody has a right to find a place where they belong. I want the refugees to feel that this is their home."" The families assisted by The Welcome to America Project typically have languished in refugee camps for 10-12 years, says Manning, and come from countries including Iraq, Myanmar, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria and Bhutan -- places where they were often persecuted because of their race, religion or political views. ""There are a number of different things they have to learn how to do when they first arrive,"" Manning says. ""They've never seen buildings built like ours. They've lived in huts literally made out of bamboo, with leaves on top. There's a lot of transition for them.""  Watch Manning describe the refugees' strikingly different backgrounds » . Over the last seven years, Manning says, she's learned a lot from the refugees and finds herself looking at American customs from a new perspective.

But then through a translator her response was, 'Why would you want to ruin bread?'"" Manning says the refugees are resourceful and eager to start a new life, developing strong ties to their new communities, making active contributions, working hard and paying taxes.

"So ill he could not move, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart supposedly sang parts of his final masterpiece, ""Requiem,"" from his deathbed. Two centuries later, the exact cause of the Austrian composer's premature death, in December 1791 at age 35, is still a mystery. This portrait by painter Johann Georg Edlinger, showed Mozart not long before his mysterious death in 1791. Theories abound. It's known that his entire body was so swollen he couldn't turn over in bed; some say jealous rivals poisoned him, while others suggest scarlet fever, tuberculosis, or lethal trichinosis from undercooked pork. Now, new evidence points to an altogether different conclusion: Mozart may have died from kidney damage caused by a strep infection, possibly strep throat. Health.com: Can't stop coughing? 8 causes of chronic cough . Dr. Richard H.C. Zegers of the University of Amsterdam and his colleagues analyzed data from Vienna's death registry. Researchers had not previously analyzed the daily death registry -- begun in handwritten script in 1607 and maintained until 1920 -- for clues to Mozart's death. Zegers and his team looked at information for 5,011 adults who died during three consecutive winters starting in 1790, as well as eyewitness accounts of Mozart's death, according to the study published this week in Annals of Internal Medicine. ""By looking at the patterns of death during Mozart's time and combining them with the signs and symptoms of his final disease, we have not one but two pillars on which our theory is built,"" said Zegers. ""Although we can't be 100 percent conclusive, I'm convinced that we have come very near the exact reason he died."" The researchers found that there were more than 500 deaths related to edema, the swelling caused by fluid in the body's tissues. Edema was the third most common cause of death at the time, after tuberculosis and malnutrition/cachexia, a physical wasting-away that was possibly caused by cancer or diabetes. Health.com: Your nutrition needs in your 30s, 40s, and 50s . During the winter of 1791, there was a spike in edema-related deaths among younger men, possibly because of an epidemic of strep throat, according to Zegers. He and his colleagues suspect that the epidemic's origin was the local military hospital, since crowded quarters are more conducive to the rapid spread of airborne bacteria such as group A Streptococcus, which can cause strep throat. Strep throat can progress to rheumatic fever, which can lead to heart valve and joint damage; scarlet fever, which is characterized by a skin rash; and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), a condition that causes fluid buildup throughout the body because of kidney damage.  Health.com: How one doctor helps patients avoid kidney problems . Strep bacteria's serious side effects are why today's experts recommend testing and prompt antibiotic treatment of strep, which causes a fiery red throat, severe pain and a high fever. However, most present-day throat infections are caused by viruses (in which case antibiotics are useless), and they often go away without treatment or serious complications. Dr. Martin Schreiber, the head of the nephrology and hypertension department at the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, said that the researchers might be on the right track. ""Is this plausible? Yes,"" said Schreiber. ""But is it definitive? No."" Contrary to previous theories suggesting that Mozart died in extremely rare circumstances, the new study does have a more reasonable conclusion based on what was happening in the community, Schreiber said. ""Using the most credible sources available from that period, they're relying upon deductive reasoning. I'm not sure if there's a more scientific approach to doing this,"" he added. Even though the death registry's data helps shed light on Mozart's cause of death, significant gaps still leave doubt. Many people witnessed the composer's final days, but most of those accounts were published decades after his death. Historians have found no written accounts by Mozart's physicians, and have relied largely on medical reports by a doctor who was familiar with the case -- but didn't treat the composer. Other sources used in the study include a biography written by the composer's wife's second husband, Georg Nikolaus von Nissen, and an eyewitness account given by Mozart's sister-in-law, Sophie Haibel, 33 years after his death. Dr. Stephen Gluck, a nephrologist at the University of California, San Francisco, finds some faults with the new theory: There are no accounts of Mozart suffering from a sore throat in the last weeks of his life; nor were there reports of high blood pressure or blood in his urine. All are telltale signs of APSGN. Gluck adds that APSGN now occurs mainly in children and is nonfatal in most cases. Mozart's cause of death is listed on the city's official registry as hitziges Frieselfieber, or miliary fever, a condition whose symptoms include a high temperature and rash. Zegers suggested this guess was made by a layperson instead of a medical authority because it was a term widely used to describe symptoms instead of an actual medical diagnosis. Although a rash is a symptom of scarlet fever, which is also caused by strep bacteria, it's more likely that Mozart's death was due to strep throat, Zegers said. None of the people who were with him during the last weeks of life reported that he had a rash, suggesting that he had the rash only at the time of his death. Scarlet fever's rash shows up the first or second day after you get sick and then subsides within six to nine days, said Zegers, so that condition is unlikely to have been the cause of death. Health.com: Four things you didn't know about natural medicine . What's more, Mozart was reported to have had a fever in the fall of 1791, which may have been caused by the initial strep infection, the researchers say. Some strep complications can occur weeks after the initial infection, and it's possible that Mozart had a sore throat before or at the time of his death and it wasn't recorded.

"(CNN) -- Pakistani civilians were given a brief window on Friday to flee the ongoing fighting between government forces and Taliban militants in the country's north, according to military officials. Pakistani civilians pack a bus leaving Mingora, the capital of the troubled Swat Valley. The Pakistan army is trying to push the Taliban away from regions within the troubled Swat Valley. A curfew was relaxed until 2 p.m. local time Friday in Kabal, Kanju and Mingora -- in the Swat Valley -- and in Malakand Agency, which is a separate district. The government provided an estimated 150 vehicles to evacuate people, as private cars are not allowed to enter Mingora. The Taliban have been concentrating forces there -- digging trenches, laying mines, taking positions on rooftops, according to strategic expert Reva Bhalla of Stratfor, a firm that describes itself as a global intelligence company. ""The Taliban are concentrating forces in Mingora -- digging trenches, laying mines, taking positions on rooftops,"" said Bhalla. ""It is not clear if the Pakistani military is trained and even equipped to go into a situation like that,"" she said, adding that even the United States military ""would have to think twice"" about such an offensive. She estimates there are 5,000 Taliban fighters in the area. ""The question is: Are they going to try to stand and fight, or try to regroup?"" she asked. With a government offensive against the Taliban nearly three weeks old, a spokesman for Pakistan's army said the military intends to drive the Taliban out of the contested area. ""The whole resolve of the government and the military is to once and for all finish the Taliban from the Valley of Swat,"" Pakistani military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN's Reza Sayah. The Pakistani military is trying to push the Taliban away from the heavily forested and mountainous regions of the Swat district toward the south, so the army can encircle the militants, Bhalla added. According to the chief minister of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, some 1.5 million people have been displaced by 10 months of fighting between the military and Taliban militants along its border with Afghanistan. The number of people at the Yar Hussain displaced-persons camp in Swabi district is expected to reach 2 million, Amir Haider Hoti said. The military announced earlier this week the number was 1.3 million. The huge refugee camps that the conflict is creating could be ""the perfect recruiting grounds for the Taliban to prey on,"" Bhalla said. Meanwhile, the United Nations' top official on refugees told CNN Thursday the world must launch a ""massive international effort"" to care for the refugees, or it will be ""absolutely impossible"" to provide for them. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, in a speech to parliament Thursday, called the refugee crisis a massive and unprecedented predicament.

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- A former hospital employee may have exposed hundreds, or even thousands, of surgical patients to hepatitis C after taking their fentanyl injections and replacing them with used syringes filled with saline solution, authorities say. A hospital worker has admitted to secretly injecting herself and using unclean syringes for patients. Kristen Diane Parker, who worked at Rose Medical Center in Denver, has admitted to secretly injecting herself in a bathroom and using unclean syringes as replacements for patients, investigators said. She had hepatitis C, which she believes she contracted through using heroin and sharing dirty needles while she lived in New Jersey in 2008, authorities said. She was a surgical technician at Rose from October 2008 to April 2009. Nine patients who had surgery there during that time have tested positive for hepatitis C. Investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker. According to an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration, Rose Medical Center knew Parker tested positive for hepatitis C. She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients. Parker quit after she was found to be in an operating room where she was not allowed to be. She subsequently tested positive for fentanyl. Hospital officials then contacted the DEA. Parker is in federal custody facing three drug-related charges. If she is found to have done serious harm to a patient, she could face up to 20 years in prison. If a patient dies because of her actions, she could face life in prison. In a statement to police, Parker said, ""I can't take back what I did, but I will have to live with it for the rest of my life, and so does everyone else."" Her attorney could not be reached Friday. Rose Medical Center is contacting 4,700 patients who had surgery at Rose during the time Parker was employed there. However, hospital officials do not believe that many patients were exposed. ""We are taking a very conservative and cautious approach by contacting everyone who had surgery during this broad time period,"" a statement on the hospital's Web site said, adding, ""It is likely that most of the patients who receive letters will not have been exposed to hepatitis C."" An additional 1,200 patients may have been infected between May 4, 2009, and July 1, 2009, when Parker worked at Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center in Colorado Springs. Audubon is also contacting patients. According to the Centers for Disease Control, hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.","Kristen Diane Parker believes she contracted hepatitis C from sharing dirty needles .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Five members of the Sri Lanka's Civil Defense Force (CDF) were killed in a suicide blast in Sri Lanka at a church outside the capital of Colombo Sunday morning, police said. Sri Lankan police officers investigate Sunday's suicide bombing near Colombo. Eight other CDF officers and two civilians were wounded, police said. Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, but police suspect the bomber was a member of the Tamil Tiger rebels. There was no immediate response from the Tamil Tiger rebels to the incident, which, police said, occurred at St. Anne's Church in the Colombo suburb of Wattala, located on a roadway to the country's only international airport about 15 kilometers (9 miles) north of the capital. The attack happened during a weekly festival that usually draws a large crowd shopping for vegetables and household goods. The suicide bomber walked into an area where CDF officers were stationed and detonated his explosives, police said. Investigators suspect the bomber targeted the area because 150 police officers who help patrol the road to the airport are billeted there. Government forces have engaged rebels in heavy fighting for more than a year in the Kilinochchi region, once the center of political power for the Tamil Tigers. The 25-year civil war between ethnic Tamil separatists and the Sri Lankan government has left more than 65,000 people dead. The Tamil Tigers were founded in 1976, and the U.S. State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. The rebels, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), are fighting for the creation of an independent nation, citing discrimination by the country's Sinhalese majority. Earlier Sunday, Sri Lanka's navy said it had destroyed a Tamil Tiger rebel boat allegedly attempting to smuggle in military supplies through the northern coast. Commander D.K.P. Dissanayake, a navy spokesman, told CNN that four rebels were killed in attack after the boat was engulfed in fire. He said the incident occurred just after midnight Sunday but gave no other details. There was no immediate response from the Tiger rebels to that incident. CNN could not independently verify the government's claim because media is debarred from Sri Lanka's battle zones. In the past, both sides in the conflict have exaggerated accounts of military operations. On December 20, the Navy said it destroyed a similar rebel boat trying to smuggle military supplies through the coast near the northeastern coastal village of Mullaitivu. However, a second supply boat was caught on Air Force aerial surveillance cameras unloading along the coast. ""They included assorted ammunition, artillery shells, mortar shells and other items,"" a senior Air Force official told CNN. He spoke on grounds of anonymity since he was not authorized to speak to the media.","NEW: Attack coincided during a weekly festival that draws a large crowd .

""My goal is to make sure that the entire industry -- from large commercial carriers to smaller, regional operators -- is meeting our safety standard."" Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed near Buffalo, New York, on February 12, killing all 49 passengers and crew members aboard. One person on the ground was also killed. Federal investigators held hearings on Capitol Hill last month on the cause of the crash but have not concluded their inquiry. Several shortcomings of the crew came to light during the National Transportation and Safety Board hearings when it was revealed that Colgan Air Capt. Marvin Renslow failed to reveal two pilot exam failures in his job application. Testimony at the hearings also revealed that fatigue apparently contributed to the failure of Renslow and First Officer Rebecca Shaw to save the plane as it approached Buffalo Niagara International Airport. USA Today newspaper reviewed the safety board's accident reports over the past 10 years and found that in nearly every serious accident involving a regional airline during that time, at least one of the pilots had failed multiple skill tests. ""In eight of the nine accidents during that time, which killed 137 people, pilots had a history of failing two or more 'check rides,' tests by federal or airline inspectors of pilots' ability to fly and respond to emergencies,"" USA Today reported Sunday. ""In the lone case in which pilots didn't have multiple failures since becoming licensed, the co-pilot was fired after the nonfatal crash for falsifying his job application."" In addition to reviewing regional airlines' training programs, Babbitt and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood have called on representatives from major air carriers, their regional partners, aviation industry groups and labor to participate in a ""call to action"" in Washington on Monday, according to a U.S. Department of Transportation news release. The review will address pilot training, cockpit discipline and other flight safety issues, the release said.","FAA to examine training at regional airlines to make sure it meets federal standards .

"OXFORD, Iowa (CNN) -- Brianne Leckness stares into the camera, a crooked smile spread across her face. It's the epitome of youth -- a young girl with bows in her hair ready to tackle the world. A dog scampers behind her in a blur. Brianne Leckness is one of 100 people featured in a new book called ""The Oxford Project."" But then you learn her story and how her life has changed since that day in 1984 when photographer Peter Feldstein took her picture in Oxford, Iowa, a town of about 700 people. You may pause. You may even cry. ""My mom left me at a church when I was 3. She used to travel with the carnival, and the carnival ended up going broke in Iowa. When my mom and my stepfather had a hard day, they'd take it out on me. So she left me at this church with our dog Freddy,"" she says. ""She pinned a note to my shirt that said, 'Please take care of her. We can't any longer.' "" Brianne's story is one of 100 captured in a new book called ""The Oxford Project."" It combines black-and-white portrait photographs -- one from 1984, a second 20 years later -- with oral histories to give a mosaic of a small town, of hopes and dreams, of triumphs and tragedies, of life and death.  ""Old hippie"" works hard, parties hard; meet other townfolk too » . Intimate details are shared: Pat Henkelman was the last in town to learn her husband of 45 years was cheating; Hunter Tandy says his second cousin, Ashton Kutcher, once visited with Demi Moore and stayed in the Super 8; Jim Hoyt Sr. breaks his silence and describes being one of the first four U.S. soldiers to liberate the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany during World War II. Feldstein began his project in 1984 with a simple idea: Snap photos of all 676 residents of Oxford. He typed up letters in April that year and delivered them to every home, most of the time taping the notes to the back door. ""The sessions will take about 5 minutes and of most importance is that you feel comfortable. We would like you to dress 'as you are,' not as you might look in your Sunday best,"" he wrote. By summer's end, the University of Iowa arts professor had photographed 670 people, six shy of the whole town. He displayed the photos at the American Legion, but then tucked them away. The prints were destroyed in a flood; the negatives were stuffed in boxes. See photos of how people changed » . Two decades later, Feldstein set out on a new quest -- to rephotograph as many people as he could find from 1984. But this time he brought along Stephen G. Bloom, a University of Iowa journalism professor, to interview the residents and record their life histories. ""I learned secrets. I learned things that some of them hadn't even told their spouses,"" says Feldstein, a resident of the town since 1978. ""More than anything, I learned about my neighbors more.""  Watch no ""Hallmark questions"" here » . Many stand in nearly the exact same pose as two decades before, their shoulders drooped with age. Children are now men; girls are now mothers. Bloom, with Feldstein present, interviewed each person separately, and the townspeople revealed their innermost feelings. Now, Feldstein traces his finger along cracks on the wall where residents stood for the photos the second time around. The cracks look like varicose veins breaking through plaster. ""The wall has changed just like the people have changed,"" Feldstein says. Bloom says journalists these days too often talk to the nation's power players and too few times to working-class people. ""The idea was not to talk to the decision makers, but talk to the people whose lives are affected by the decision makers,"" he says. ""My job in Oxford was to talk to the voiceless, to people who don't have any voice who are the backbone of America."" On a recent Sunday, Oxford residents flocked to St. Mary's Hall for the big debut. Books were sprawled out on 1960s-style wooden tables. Residents snatched them up and began signing each other's copies, as if it were a high school yearbook signing.  Learn facts about Oxford » . Kathy Brack clutched her book to her heart. ""I've been hugging it ever since I got it,"" says the schoolteacher of 34 years. ""There were things in there that the gossip line didn't know about!"" Nearby, one of her former students, Ben Stoker, held his copy. In 1984, his father, Dave, held his boy proudly for Feldstein's camera. The father's arms are outstretched, his newborn son asleep in his hands. A gentle smile can be seen from beneath his dad's thick beard. Ben's mother, Darnell, was photographed a couple of weeks before. She's dressed in a plaid maternity outfit, pregnant with Ben. ""When I was 10, my dad died,"" Ben Stoker told Bloom and Feldstein. ""Pretty much I think about my dad every day. I remember feeling his beard against my face. I remember his hands -- they were soft and warm. ""Two years ago, when I was 19, my mother died of cancer. She was my guiding light."" In a corner of the hall this day, Kevin Somerville -- a large man in overalls, a bushy beard and a boisterous laugh -- sits with his wife, Mary, and grown daughter, Kristi. They say they thought they knew everything about everybody in town, until they got ahold of the book. Everyone seemed to spill the beans -- to two ""East Coast Jews,"" as Feldstein puts it. Why would residents of an entire town open their hearts? ""People will talk if you're willing to listen,"" Kristi Somerville says. ""They're not small-town stories. They're human stories."" Her mother adds of Bloom's at-ease style. ""He said, 'Tell me about your life.' How often does somebody ask you that: Tell me about your life?"" Brianne Leckness, now 30 years old, shows up with Blanche Smith, her foster mother during her years in Oxford. Blanche has taken in more than 500 foster children over the years. But she still remembers that day when she gave up Brianne to another foster home. She was raising three teenage sons and couldn't handle a young girl in grade school. ""Yes,"" she says, crying when asked if she wished she had kept Brianne. Later in the day, about three dozen Oxford residents make the 16-mile trek to Iowa City. Hundreds of Iowans pack the Englert Theatre for an on-stage performance of The Oxford Project. Sixteen local Iowans read the stories of the Oxford residents as told in the book. Only one person tells her own story. It's Brianne Leckness. ""When I was 9, Blanche said to me, 'I really can't be your mom any longer.' In my next family, the mother would put my hair up. But I was a tomboy, and it drove them mad. I went to three or four other foster homes after that."" ""... On my 18th birthday, my mother blew into town. She wanted us to go on 'The Montel Williams Show' and say how she really never wanted to give me up."" She ends with: ""Nothing for me has been normal, so why should now be normal?"" Brianne is a mother now, determined to raise her own children and not to make the same mistakes her mother made. As the night drew to a close, she stood with the 16 others on stage to raucous applause. She smiled and took a bow. She was a portrait of courage. A model of a small town. A real American. Afterward, she said it felt good to ""relive part of my past that was a good experience."" ""It was nice. It was really nice."" What are we to make of stories like these? ""I walked away from this knowing that life turns on a dime,"" Bloom says. ""I realized that life is really dependent on moments, and you don't know when those moments are going to take place when you wake up. And sometimes when you go to sleep at night, you don't realize those moments have taken place."" ""The story in Oxford really isn't about Oxford, Iowa. It's about any small town in the United States -- anywhere in the world.""","Peter Feldstein set out in 1984 to photograph everyone in Iowa town .

"(WIRED) -- Hackers who commandeer your computer are bad enough. Now scientists worry that someday, they'll try to take over your brain. Scientists can use brain signals to control computers -- hands free. In the past year, researchers have developed technology that makes it possible to use thoughts to operate a computer, maneuver a wheelchair or even use Twitter -- all without lifting a finger. But as neural devices become more complicated, and go wireless, some scientists say the risks of ""brain hacking"" should be taken seriously. ""Neural devices are innovating at an extremely rapid rate and hold tremendous promise for the future,"" said computer security expert Tadayoshi Kohno of the University of Washington. ""But if we don't start paying attention to security, we're worried that we might find ourselves in five or 10 years saying we've made a big mistake."" Hackers tap into personal computers all the time. But what would happen if they focused their nefarious energy on neural devices, such as the deep-brain stimulators used to treat Parkinson's and depression, or electrode systems for controlling prosthetic limbs? According to Kohno and his colleagues, who published their concerns July 1 in Neurosurgical Focus, most devices carry few security risks. But as neural engineering becomes more complex and more widespread, the potential for security breaches will mushroom. ""It's very hard to design complex systems that don't have bugs,"" Kohno said. ""As these medical devices start to become more and more complicated, it gets easier and easier for people to overlook a bug that could become a very serious risk. It might border on science fiction today, but so did going to the moon 50 years ago."" Some might question why anyone would want to hack into someone else's brain, but the researchers say there's a precedent for using computers to cause neurological harm. In November 2007 and March 2008, malicious programmers vandalized epilepsy support Web sites by putting up flashing animations, which caused seizures in some photo-sensitive patients. ""It happened on two separate occasions,"" said computer science graduate student Tamara Denning, a co-author on the paper. ""It's evidence that people will be malicious and try to compromise peoples' health using computers, especially if neural devices become more widespread."" In some cases, patients might even want to hack into their own neural device. Unlike devices to control prosthetic limbs, which still use wires, many deep brain stimulators already rely on wireless signals. Hacking into these devices could enable patients to ""self-prescribe"" elevated moods or pain relief by increasing the activity of the brain's reward centers. Despite the risks, Kohno said, most new devices aren't created with security in mind. Neural engineers carefully consider the safety and reliability of new equipment, and neuroethicists focus on whether a new device fits ethical guidelines. But until now, few groups have considered how neural devices might be hijacked to perform unintended actions. This is the first time an academic paper has addressed the topic of ""neurosecurity,"" a term the group coined to describe their field. ""The security and privacy issues somehow seem to slip by,"" Kohno said. ""I would not be surprised if most people working in this space have never thought about security."" Kevin Otto, a bioengineer who studies brain-machine interfaces at Purdue Universty, said he was initially skeptical of the research. ""When I first picked up the paper, I don't know if I agreed that it was an issue. But the paper gives a very compelling argument that this is important, and that this is the time to have neural engineers collaborate with security developers."" It's never too early to start thinking about security issues, said neural engineer Justin Williams of the University of Wisconsin, who was not involved in the research. But he stressed that the kinds of devices available today are not susceptible to attack, and that fear of future risks shouldn't impede progress in the field. ""These kinds of security issues have to proceed in lockstep with the technology,"" Williams said. History provides plenty of examples of why it's important to think about security before it becomes a problem, Kohno said. Perhaps the best example is the Internet, which was originally conceived as a research project and didn't take security into account. ""Because the Internet was not originally designed with security in mind,"" the researchers wrote, ""it is incredibly challenging -- if not impossible -- to retrofit the existing Internet infrastructure to meet all of today's security goals."" Kohno and his colleagues hope to avoid such problems in the neural device world, by getting the community to discuss potential security problems before they become a reality. ""The first thing is to ask ourselves is, 'Could there be a security and privacy problem?'"" Kohno said. ""Asking 'Is there a problem?' gets you 90 percent there, and that's the most important thing."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- Diprivan is a powerful I.V. anesthetic drug used for patients undergoing certain surgeries and diagnostic procedures. Patients undergoing surgery may receive Diprivan to keep them sedated during the procedure. The drug is making headlines with the claim from a nurse who worked for pop icon Michael Jackson that the singer, who died June 25, had repeatedly asked her about the drug. Nurse Cherilyn Lee told CNN that Jackson had brought up Diprivan about three months ago, saying he needed it for insomnia and that his doctor said it was safe. ""He said, 'I am so sleepy. I cannot sleep. I want to have at least eight hours of sleep,'"" Lee told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The medication, whose generic name is propofol, renders the patient unconscious for as long as doctors deem necessary. The patient wakes up almost immediately after the infusion is stopped, experts say. But treating sleep disorders is not an approved use of the drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says Diprivan should be given only by people trained in the administration of general anesthesia and who are not involved in the conduct of the surgery or diagnostic procedure.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain when and how propofol (Diprivan) is used » . The general anesthetic has the effect of making patients feel well-rested when they wake up from it, said Dr. Hector Vila, chairman of the Ambulatory Surgery Committee for the American Society of Anesthesiologists. Vila gives the drug to all of his patients who are getting office procedures in areas such as urology, dentistry and gynecology. It is also the most common anesthetic for colonoscopies, he said. ""I have never heard of anyone using it for the treatment of a sleep disorder,"" he said. There have been cases of health care professionals self-administering the drug and abusing it, however, said Vila, who has examined deaths from Diprivan in Florida. Other deaths from the drug have occurred when administered by non-anesthetist professionals, in settings such as ophthalmology, gynecology and plastic surgery, he said. Diprivan appears white and milky, and is usually run as an I.V. drip. In addition to surgical applications, it can be used in the intensive care unit for someone who may be intubated on a ventilator. The drug itself does not provide pain relief, experts say. The principle risks of Diprivan come from improper monitoring of the patient's breathing, Vila said. When a person's breathing slows down, not enough carbon dioxide gets removed from the body, and not enough oxygen enters. This could lead to cardiac arrest, he said. Still, when used properly, Diprivan is not a dangerous drug, he said. ""It's very safe in a properly trained physician's hands."" The drug has been used in the past to treat prolonged epileptic seizures. A small MayoClinic study in 2008 found that Diprivan was associated with a higher risk of cardiac arrest and deaths in patients with a condition called refractory status epilepticus. Side effects of Diprivan may include dizziness and lightheadedness. Balance, coordination and judgment may be affected for up to 24 hours, so patients should not drive cars, play sports or sign contracts in that period, Vila said. Patients may also experience a euphoric feeling upon waking up, Vila said. This is distinct from older anesthetics, which caused nausea and vomiting, he said. The FDA also issued a warning to health care professionals in 2007 about patients who experienced chills, fever and body aches shortly after receiving the drug for sedation or general anesthesia. Doctors consider sedation a continuum, where relaxation is on the mild side and general anesthesia is at the other extreme. There may be complications of Diprivan if the patient is also taking prescription pain medications, experts say. Patients should tell their health care providers about any allergies they have before taking this drug, doctors say, including eggs, soy products, sulfite, benzyl alcohol and any medications. CNN's Stephanie Smith contributed to this report.","Diprivan renders the patient unconscious for as long as doctors deem necessary .

"(CNN) -- Albert Einstein is often quoted as saying, ""In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity."" Planning a road trip is hardly nuclear science, but perhaps the professor had learned that a well-chosen overnight stop can yield treasured memories. Here are four midway suggestions that may brighten a tedious road trip from one region of the nation to another. I-95 between Massachusetts and Florida: Follow Lincoln's footsteps . Like Abraham Lincoln in 1865, why not take a walking tour of the former capital of the Confederacy? ""Very few people know that Lincoln visited Richmond with his son near the end of the Civil War,"" said Mike Andrus of the Richmond National Battlefield Park in Virginia. Map this trip and three others . Richmond remains a very walkable city in this area, from the James River to the Confederate White House to Capitol Square. Civilwartraveler.com offers free downloadable podcasts to guide you on a 90-minute walk in Lincoln's footsteps. Near the square is St. Paul's Episcopal Church, where Confederate President Jefferson Davis in 1865 learned the troubling news that his troops were no longer able to defend the city. During your walk, stop for lunch at one of the many restaurants in Shockoe Bottom, which once served as a market for slave traders. Near there, see Richmond's Slavery Reconciliation Statue, a 15-foot, half-ton sculpture unveiled in 2007 that remembers and offers regret for Virginia's role in the African slave trade. Looking for a special breakfast or lunch? Try the internationally recognized Perly's, where you can enjoy homemade biscuits, made with what longtime owner Gray Wyatt calls his secret ingredient. Located in the city's Monroe Ward district in a 1930s-era building, Perly's has a ""real retro feel to it,"" said Wyatt. In addition to traditional breakfast fare, the lunch menu offers Brunswick stew, chicken salad and signature sandwiches. Customers include Gov. Tim Kaine, a former Richmond mayor who's quoted as saying more business gets conducted at Perly's than in most of the offices downtown. I-75 between Michigan and Florida: 'Paradise' and a murder scene . At the southern tail of the Appalachian Mountains, about 90 miles north of Atlanta, lies Chattooga County, Georgia -- home to a world renowned artist, an attorney who inspired a TV series, and what may be a haunted house. Almost every day, attorney Bobby Lee Cook can be found enjoying the food at The Brass Lantern in Summerville. Cook is said to be one of the inspirations behind 1980s TV defense lawyer Matlock, who was portrayed by Andy Griffith. ""They had to pick somebody I guess, so they picked this country hooligan,"" joked Cook. The Brass Lantern offers American cuisine ""with a little French twist,"" he said. ""It reminds me of country restaurants in the South of France."" Looking for a taste of Southern hospitality? Cook recommends Dillard's B&B as a fine place to hang your hat during your visit. Summerville also is the home of the late Howard Finster, a self-taught folk artist whose work was embraced in the 1980s by musicians such as REM and the Talking Heads. His home has been transformed into a fascinating and sometimes bizarre world he called Paradise Gardens. Finster's home celebrates a unique era of Appalachian culture that's quickly fading, said Tommy Littleton, chairman of the nonprofit group that owns the gardens. The fame that Finster gained in the '80s can be fleeting, he said, ""but the niche he created and its influence now on two generations of artists means that the gardens really are a part of art history."" For three decades Finster used the four-acre property as a canvas, painting sidewalks and buildings and using ""found materials"" to decorate walls and various objects throughout the grounds. He built ""display houses"" for all of his art, which included a huge collection of mosaics. Finster's work hangs in museums around the nation, including the Smithsonian and museums in San Francisco, California, and Baltimore, Maryland. Finster's gardens are open only from Thursday through Saturday, so check the Web site for times. More adventurous travelers might ask local residents to help them find the ruins of a destroyed country estate called Corpsewood Manor, where two men were murdered in 1982. A pair of killers was sentenced to life in prison for the notorious crime -- which spawned rumors about devil worship and satanic rituals that continue to echo on the Internet. I-84 between the Pacific Northwest and Utah: Opulence and flying fury . The area along the Oregon-Idaho border has a lot to offer travelers looking for a memorable experience between the Northwest and Utah. The amazing Geiser Grand Hotel in Baker City, Oregon, often attracts guests who are en route to regional ski resorts. Those who renovated the Geiser in 1997 aimed to restore it to the opulence it enjoyed when the German-Swiss Geiser family first built it in 1889 -- complete with ornate, decorative stained glass fittings, said owner Barbara Sidway. ""Everything that could be preserved was preserved and everything that couldn't was lovingly replicated,"" she said. ""It's like stepping back in time with its intimate feel and rare level of glamour and opulence."" The cast of the 1969 film ""Paint Your Wagon""  -- including Hollywood tough guys Clint Eastwood and the late Lee Marvin -- were pampered guests at the Geiser. according to Sidway. Surrounding the hotel is Baker City's historic district, including more than 100 buildings listed in the National Register of Historic Places, said Sidway. Special holiday events held each Friday in December include rides on a horse-drawn sleigh to the nearby Powder River, where guests are invited to gather around a blazing bonfire and sip hot spiced cider. Inside the hotel, enjoy high tea amid the glow of a spectacular Christmas tree set in the center of the Palm Court dining area. About two hours down I-84, Nampa, Idaho, you'll find a pair of Hollywood stars you may have seen without realizing it. The Warhawk Air Museum is home to two rare Curtiss P40 World War II-era fighter planes, which appeared in 2001's ""Pearl Harbor"" and 2008's ""Valkyrie,"" said museum co-founder Sue Paul. On the set of ""Valkyrie,"" star Tom Cruise turned to Paul, took her hand, and told her, ""'I want to thank you so much for the honor of using your beautifully preserved historical airplanes in this movie,'"" recalled Paul.  ""Never before had anyone on any of the films we've worked on recognized the historical significance of these airplanes."" For nightlife, drive 20 miles down I-84 and visit the pedestrian-friendly downtown district of Boise, Idaho, with its vibrant bars and eateries. For decades, locals have been enjoying the classic dishes at Angell's Bar & Grill, on 9th Street, and the central pedestrian area, where visitors can stroll and peruse local shops. I-80 between California and Utah: Basque food oasis . For generations Reno has been well-known as Nevada's ""Biggest Little City in the World,"" but road-trippers with a taste for good food often talk about a tiny town about 2½ hours northeast along I-80. The Basque community that settled in Winnemucca's high desert in the mid-19th century is still going strong, offering a little taste of Europe at several of the town's restaurants and hotels. The fare at the century-old Martin Hotel is repeatedly praised by foodies on Chowhound.com. Chefs at the Martin serve tasty meals, including Basque lamb dishes and traditional pork loin solomo, say fans. Established as a rooming house for traffic along the nearby Southern Pacific Railroad, the hotel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, according to the hotel Web site. ""The lamb shanks as a main are awesome,"" wrote Chowhound.com poster nvcook in July. ""I also like their halibut and their ribeyes."" Another Chowhound poster extolled the lamb shanks served five blocks down Melarkey Street at Ormachea's Dinner House, which is another highly touted Basque eatery in Winnemucca.","Clint Eastwood, Lee Marvin stayed at century-old Geiser Grand Hotel in Oregon .

"(CNN) -- Lindsay Spencer was two years out of college and facing one of the biggest decisions of her young life: what to do with those Facebook friend requests from people she met through her job. Blurring work and personal friendships is prompting Lindsay Spencer to maintain separate Facebook pages. ""There's nothing on my personal page that's horrible,"" says the 24-year-old communications coordinator for the National Peanut Board in Atlanta, Georgia. ""It's just that there are some things that are not work-appropriate."" Many of the job-related friend requests came after meeting people at conferences. Eventually they would find her by searching on Facebook and request to be ""friended."" Initially Spencer decided to ignore the requests. After all, does a virtual stranger really care what her favorite movies are? Do they really benefit from learning details about her weekend leisure time? Spencer's answer was to create a second Facebook page, which she devotes to work-related information. This means she now has her ""friend friends,"" about 400 of them, and then she has her ""work friends,"" four, so far. Spencer's modern dilemma is becoming more common throughout the world, experts say, as friendships with co-workers extend to our lives spent online after work hours. Simultaneously, our computer time at the office is becoming an extension of our personal life, they say. 'Work takes place in more places now' This isn't necessarily a bad thing, says Paul Levinson, professor of communication and media studies at Fordham University in New York. ""No one ever forces us to go online -- we can shut it off,"" he says. ""What this is really all about is an increase in information sharing."" And with the popularity of smartphones and other handheld devices, many people carry their work into their homes and are never separated from e-mail. They also have the ability to stay in constant touch with their favorite social networking sites. ""There is increasingly less difference in work life and personal time,"" Levinson says. ""We are coming from a time when there were very clear boundaries. That comes from an older expectation. Work takes place in more places now."" And again, Levinson doesn't think it's a bad thing to have access to all this information about work and co-workers. Spencer, who has friended her manager but not her big boss, says she likes to think her co-workers are sensible enough not to put out too much information -- especially photographs -- on social networking sites. And so far, so good. There have been no embarrassing images of drunken escapades, no status updates erupting with emotional outbursts. Social networking sites have both good and bad uses in the business world, says Dr. Lynn Friedman, a clinical psychologist and adjunct faculty member at Johns Hopkins University. Face time vs. Facebook time . People can use the sites to make new acquaintances outside their departments and groups, and users can extend their networks beyond the traditional workplace, she says in an interview by e-mail. ""It's a way to enter new professional galaxies."" But people can use the sites too much and as a consequence give less time to meeting with co-workers in person. ""In most businesses, it's optimal to mix social networking with real-life face-to-face interaction,"" she writes. ""However, social networking can provide a springboard for identifying kindred spirits with whom one might want to do something old-fashioned like, say, having a cup of coffee. In an ideal world, it's best to relate to others in both cyber and real space."" Paula Pile, a psychologist who practices in North Carolina, says you need to be careful to make sure that social networking sites aren't encroaching on your office time. More than an hour a day is excessive, she warns. Worse, spending too much time on the sites can disrupt your balance between work and private time. It can also take you out of your family time with your spouse or children. ""If you are spending two hours at home on them each night, you are not available to your family,"" she says. Set boundaries . Both psychologists advise setting boundaries between yourself and the people you work with, as well as your online ""friends."" Friedman also suggests setting goals for using social networking sites and telling others about your limits to avoid hurt feelings. She uses an example of someone who lets people know, ""I don't do those things at nights or on weekends so I can have my time with family."" And Pile says to consider who you're corresponding with during your work time. If they aren't people you would talk to in ""real life,"" she says, you probably are wasting time.","Do job-related Facebook friends really need to know details of your personal life?
Facebook user decided to separate her ""friend friends"" and her ""work friends""
Expert: More than one hour per day on social sites is too much .

"(CNN) -- Cindy Goodman was having dinner with a group of girlfriends one night when the conversation took a surprising turn. Summer at the beach may seem like fun, but more Americans are afraid to take time off. Goodman asked her friends where they planned to go this year for their summer vacation. Nowhere, they answered. They were afraid to take time off because they didn't want to risk losing their jobs, she says. ""It's going to be an interesting summer,"" says Goodman, a Miami Herald business columnist. ""The people who still have a job are really feeling overwhelmed and overworked. They're afraid to take vacations, but at the same time, they need them more than ever."" The bad economy isn't just depleting bank accounts. It's cutting into people's vacation time. Americans typically take time off and kick back during the summer. This year may be different. People are worried that a temporary vacation could lead to permanent time off, Goodman says. ""I don't think anyone is going to be fired for taking two weeks off, but they might think that they'll think of another way of doing my job without me,"" says Goodman, who wrote about people's vacation fears for her blog at http://worklifebalancingact.blogspot.com. How to take time off without guilt . Americans had a difficult time taking vacations even before the economy slumped. Numerous articles and studies draw the same conclusions: Americans don't know how to pry themselves away from the workplace. This year, Expedia.com, the travel reservation company, conducted a survey that compared Americans' vacation habits with their counterparts in other countries. The survey said about 34 percent of Americans don't take all the vacation time they earn each year. In contrast, 22 percent of French citizens and 24 percent of Germans don't take all the vacation allotted to them. Japanese workers are the least interested in using all of their vacation days, according to the Expedia survey. About 92 percent of Japanese workers do not take all of their vacation days. Christine Louise Hohlbaum, author of ""The Power of Slow: 101 Ways to Save Time in Our 24/7 World,"" says even when Americans manage to take vacations, they still don't completely leave their office, because of technology. ""You can take a BlackBerry on vacation and still have a conversation with clients anywhere else in the world,"" Hohlbaum says. ""It's wonderful for innovation, but not so great for leisure."" But workers who don't take vacation hurt themselves and their companies, Hohlbaum says. Overworked employees get sick more often and place themselves at risk for long-term illnesses such as heart disease. Companies suffer because their employees are too tired or ill to be productive, she said. Workplaces are full of exhausted employees who have already checked out in their cubicles, Hohlbaum says. ""If people are overworked, they're surfing the Internet,"" she says. ""They're not contributing to the bottom line."" Hohlbaum says she talked to a computer technician who found a way to take more time off but be more productive. He started a walking group for his colleagues during lunch hour. He and his colleagues were transformed. ""It was an amazing experience,"" Hohlbaum says. ""They bonded. It helped people relax and when they got back to work, they were much more productive."" She suggests that other workers follow his example. Explain the upside of the idea to the boss: The company benefits from well-rested workers because they're more productive. Set performance goals with your boss to prove taking time off will allow you to thrive and will result in greater productivity, she says. Some workers, however, find that their biggest skeptic may be internal; they don't know how to take it easy anymore, Hohlbaum says. ""If you're so used to being purposeful, make leisure time your purpose,"" Hohlbaum says. Alternative ideas . Goodman, the Miami Herald columnist, offers some of her own tips for taking time off. If you're too afraid to ask for an extended vacation, plan four-day weekends or time off around holidays. Goodman says she's going to take a four-day vacation around the Fourth of July. But there was a time when she traditionally took two-week vacations during the summer. ""I have the same kind of fear that everyone else has, '' Goodman says. ""I want to take time off, but I don't want to miss too much work time. I want to keep my column in the paper every week.""","People fear that vacationing in recession could lead to permanent time off .

"New York (CNN) -- A Bosnian-American who has been charged in an FBI terror inquiry ""provided very detailed information"" about his ""terrorist-related activities"" after waiving his right to a lawyer, federal prosecutors said. Adis Medunjanin, 25, has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit murder in a foreign country and receiving military-type training from al Qaeda. Officials say he is an associate of Najibullah Zazi, who is accused of conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction on U.S. soil. In a letter to Judge Raymond J. Dearie, filed Friday, federal prosecutors said Medunjanin spoke to authorities three times about the ""terrorist-related activities of himself and others in the United States and Pakistan"" after he waived his right to a lawyer. ""Prior to questioning ... the agents read the defendant his Miranda rights, which he waived orally and in writing,"" the letter said. It described the first session with Medunjanin, which occurred in a hospital after he crashed his car on New York's Whitestone Expressway. ""In addition, the agents specifically advised the defendant that they were aware that he was represented by an attorney, and asked the defendant if he wished to speak with them despite being represented. The defendant informed the agents that he was willing to answer their questions without an attorney, and added that he no longer wished to be represented by Robert Gottlieb,"" the letter said. All of the sessions occurred before Medunjanin's January 8 indictment, according to the letter. Gottlieb had argued in a letter to the judge filed Monday that his client was ""intentionally and improperly hidden from his attorneys ... resulting in a coerced and invalid waiver of his right to our assistance as his longtime counsel."" Gottlieb said he has represented Medunjanin since September. The attorney also asked the judge to sign subpoenas so that Gottlieb can file a motion to suppress alleged statements that Medunjanin made, according to the letter. ""It is our understanding that law enforcement obtained statements from Mr. Medunjanin ... [that] we expect the Government will seek to use in Mr. Medunjanin's prosecution, and which we intend to ask this Court to suppress in a pretrial motion."" He added, ""It is our expectation that the records and materials we seek by these proposed subpoenas will establish both the efforts taken by law enforcement to move Mr. Medunjanin and secret him from his attorneys and to obtain an unlawful purported waiver of his right to the assistance of his attorney,"" the letter said. In addition to speaking to agents from the Joint Terrorism Task Force in the hospital January 7, Medunjanin was interviewed later that day at the FBI offices in New York, the federal prosecutors said in their letter. There, Medunjanin signed a waiver of his right to a speedy arraignment, the letter said. The waiver form included the charges against him and informed him of his Miranda rights, including his right to have an attorney present during questioning. Medunjanin signed the waiver, the letter said. The next day, Medunjanin again waived his Miranda rights orally and in writing, the letter said. ""The defendant continued to provide the agents with information concerning his activities and the activities of others,"" the letter said. After his indictment by a jury in the Eastern District of New York, federal prosecutors gave Medunjanin another speedy arraignment waiver, one that included an additional sentence, the letter said. ""Responding to a specific request from Mr. Gottlieb ... the government added the following language to the form ... 'I have been advised that attorney Robert Gottlieb has requested to speak with me,' "" the letter said. As agents were explaining the form to Medunjanin and telling him that he had been indicted, ""the defendant expressed concerns about being charged with conspiracy to kill United States nationals abroad,"" the letter said. ""The defendant stated, in sum and substance, 'Maybe I should talk to Mr. Gottlieb,' and indicated this on the form,"" the letter said. ""At this point, agents ceased questioning,"" the letter said. Medunjanin arrived in the United States in 1994 and became a citizen in 2002. Gottlieb has said his client and Zazi attended the same high school and frequented the same mosque. Authorities say Zazi, who has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy charges, planned to use an explosive device in New York on September 11, 2009, the eighth anniversary of the U.S. terror attacks. Another man said to be linked to Zazi, taxi driver Zarein Ahmedzay, has pleaded not guilty to lying to a federal agent, according to his attorney, Michael Marinaccio. Ahmedzay and Medunjanin, residents of the New York borough of Queens, had been under surveillance.","Suspect has given FBI ""very detailed information"" about activities, officials say .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Mary Blilie had been at Big Sky Resort in Montana for just one day but had already snapped more photos of her kids than she had in a long time. Three minutes is considered a long lift line, Big Sky and Moonlight Basin fans say. That's because when Blilie, now a Minneapolis engineer, was a kid her family skied here every winter, and after a 17-year hiatus, she was determined to create some of those same happy memories for her own two children, as well as her nieces and nephews who, along with their parents, had come along for the trip down memory lane. The resort might boast new lifts and base village buildings this season, but Blilie says that low-key vibe remains. ""No one gets too bothered about anything,"" she explains. And the skiing couldn't be better -- some 400 inches of snow a year. Big Sky (www.bigskyresort.com) and neighboring Moonlight Basin (www.moonlightbasin.com), in fact, boast the ""biggest skiing in America"" -- 5,512 acres with the Big Sky Resort-Moonlight Basin Interconnect that joins the two adjacent ski areas with terrain that's guaranteed to satisfy every skier and snowboarder in your family, whether they want the steeps and deeps (like my kids); long, pristine groomers where, even on busy days, you might not see another soul (my pick); or wide, gentle runs ideal for beginners. ""My son doesn't want to leave,"" said Sandy Itkoff, of Los Angeles, who was a guest at Moonlight Basin. Whatever your age, you can't help but be impressed by the sheer beauty of the place -- the huge rugged mountains, the snow covered trees, the vistas that seem to go on forever. If not for all the fresh powder, Moonlight ski instructor Jim Ackerman tells me we'd see all kinds of animal tracks leading into the woods. Three minutes is considered a long lift line, Big Sky and Moonlight Basin fans say, and the kids' ski schools guarantee small classes. The new Dakota lift expected to open this month at Big Sky will provide easy access to even more terrain. Another plus: Parents not only don't worry about aggressive skiers and boarders running into little ones on crowded slopes, but marvel at how friendly everyone is. Grandmother Ellen Lord noted that when all of the family's luggage got lost, Big Sky employees scrambled to find them all some clothes. The free apres-ski kids club at Big Sky gets thumbs up from parents too, enabling them to get a guilt-free break. Skiing here can be a good deal too, parents say, with kids 10 and under skiing free and adult lifts at Moonlight Basin ($51 a day) and Big Sky ($75) less than at many other major resorts. (Consider that a daily ticket at Aspen this season is $87) Junior tickets for tweens and teens are less as well. And there's no pressure to dress to the nines on the slopes or off, adds Cecile George, winding up a ski week with her husband and kids. ""I've been wearing the same pair of jeans all week and no one cares!"" says the Memphis mom. ""We're never going back to Vail."" Consider that Big Sky and Moonlight Basin -- about an hour's drive from Bozeman (and an hour's drive from Yellowstone National Park) -- have more terrain than Vail but less than half the skiers. Locals joke that they've got nearly twice as many acres than skiers because Montanans like their elbow room. That's why on one of the busiest weeks of the year, I was able to ski down runs so empty I felt I was in the back country, especially with all of the fresh powder. (There are opportunities to try back-country skiing or ice climbing as well here with Montana Alpine Guides (www.montanaalpineguides.com). ""It takes an extra flight to get here, but it's so worth it,"" says Jim Caccavo, a Californian from San Diego whose wife and kids like Moonlight Basin so much they bought a second home here. ""This place is like a secret club,"" jokes Jeremy Collis, the New Zealander who is the director of Moonlight Basin's small (just 47 instructors) ski school. And that's double the size it was last year. Still, that enables Collis to keep his classes to five kids (or fewer) for grade-schoolers and three or fewer for preschoolers. Anyone who has ever checked a child in at a major ski resort over a holiday week knows how rare that is. Next door, Christine Baker, who oversees Big Sky's children's program, also promises small classes and something even more important to parents. ""A family feeling. She grew up skiing at Big Sky -- as did a half-dozen of her instructors. ""It's nice to have that connection,"" she says. ""It's pretty special."" It's also pretty quiet. There are only a few restaurants in the Big Sky base area and just one at Moonlight Basin: Others require a 15-minute drive or longer. For the most part, this is the kind of place where you want to ski hard, cozy up in front of a fire with your honey and your kids, eat spaghetti, watch the movies you never had time to see at home or play Scrabble. That's what we did -- first at our ski-in/ski out log cabin in Big Sky (having our own hot tub was the best part) and then at a ski house at Moonlight Basin. ""This takes the experience back to an old-fashioned ski vacation when you made your own fun,"" observes Collis, himself the father of two young children. My daughters and I managed to rouse ourselves one afternoon after skiing at Moonlight Basin to go to the spa and one night to take a Sno-Cat ride two miles into the back country in the dark for an excellent dinner (tenderloin and mashed potatoes followed by chocolate fondue) in a big, heated yurt, courtesy of Moonlight Dinners. The kids sledded outside between courses (www.skimba.com). One afternoon, we left the kids to test their mettle on the resort's most challenging terrain and we leisurely skied back to our cabin door. By the time we got there, the kids were back and had a fire blazing in the fireplace. The hot tub on our back deck beckoned. We soaked, surrounded by snow and evergreens. There wasn't a person in sight. We had no place to rush off to -- no homework, no work, no friends waiting, limited Internet access, no phone calls. There's a lot to be said for old-fashioned ski vacations.  (For more Taking the Kids, visit www.takingthekids.com, where Eileen Ogintz welcomes your questions and comments.)

"Editor's note: Nick Taylor is the author of six books, including ""American-Made -- The Enduring Legacy of the WPA: When FDR Put the Nation to Work."" He also has collaborated on five other books, including John Glenn's memoir. Taylor worked in politics in the 1970s, including Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign and a congressional run for John Lewis, and was a volunteer in Barack Obama's campaign. Nick Taylor says Americans can learn lessons from the accomplishments of the WPA in the Depression. (CNN) -- Companies today are slashing jobs with a meat ax. Recession looms or is already here, depending on whom you ask. Some predict unemployment rising into double figures. We've got a bad case of the economic willies, and are scared about what lies ahead. Lessons from the Works Progress Administration can give us guidance for the future. The WPA was Franklin Roosevelt's response to massive unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. It put more than 8 million Americans to work before the program closed when World War II drove unemployment close to zero. It helped people save their homes and feed their families in the short run, but the work they did benefited the United States long after the Depression ended. The WPA renewed the country's infrastructure. Thirty years into the 20th century, with automobile use exploding, drivers in the United States still faced a road and bridge network dating to the 19th century. Farmers mired in the mud, salesmen and truckers made long detours to cross rivers. The WPA built farm-to-market roads in every section of the country. This not only eased farmers' paths to market, but also gave everyone whose living depended on road transportation the benefit of more efficiency. Later, when the Second World War loomed, the WPA's road and bridge work helped move troops and materiel among bases and to staging areas.  See photos from Taylor's book » . Large passenger airplanes were just beginning to appear, and airlines were seeking inter-city routes. Towns and cities turned to the WPA to build new airports and improve old ones with new and longer runways. Expanding the availability of air travel thrust America into the new age of civil aviation. WPA workers made the country healthier by modernizing water and sewage treatment facilities around the country, replacing countless outdoor privies with sanitary systems, and digging trenches and laying in new water lines. They built hospitals, courthouses, schools and libraries. Even before the war came, the program built armories and improved crumbling military bases, and as the fighting drew closer, it added new barracks and bases and even more airports for national defense. WPA workers also met a wide array of human needs. They fought floods and forest fires and cleaned up afterward, inoculated children, helped overstressed mothers get their kids to school, and made and served millions of hot lunches to schoolchildren. They even built swimming pools and golf courses. The WPA was the most controversial program of Roosevelt's New Deal. Conservatives criticized its projects as unnecessary make-work and called its workers shiftless shovel-leaners. But those workers gave the country a new infrastructure to go with the new century, and much of this work endures today. And in no small way, one of the WPA's gifts to the country was hope and confidence in a brighter future. In all of these areas, the WPA provides models that we can use in today's economic crisis. The United States is not likely to become the primary employer of the jobless as it was during the Depression. But the landscape of needs is as great today as it was then, and cleverly targeted programs can use workers that might otherwise be jobless to meet some of our most pressing needs. Mayors and governors tell us we face an infrastructure shortfall that will cost trillions to repair. Our transportation network is again behind the times. Commuters spend hours getting back and forth to work. Suppliers often can't make on-time deliveries. Many passenger rail systems are decrepit. Airline travelers frequently endure bizarre delays. Attention paid to improving all or part of this interconnected system would pay dividends for many years to come. Workers would not all have to be employed building new roads or making other physical improvements to the infrastructure. Many jobs could be found that would reduce pressure on it and improve overall mobility, by promoting public transportation and charging drivers more for driving at peak times, for example. In either case, we would realize the benefits far into the future. Many have suggested the U.S. needs a ""green WPA"" to improve the environment and move the country toward energy independence. Again, rather than directly improving the infrastructure, job programs could reduce the stress on it. A new force of workers might not work at improving the electric grid, but they could survey urban rooftops for their suitability for installing solar panels, or take wind readings in promising areas for potential wind farms. They might install recycling stations in areas where they don't exist. Harry Hopkins, who headed the WPA, said that government is the only entity that doesn't count improvements to its physical plant on the plus side of the ledger. Government accounting notwithstanding, a WPA-like initiative could move the United States firmly into the 21st century, make it more efficient to do business and create a source of unity and national pride that will last far into the future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nick Taylor.","Nick Taylor: The WPA was a Depression-era government jobs program .

"Burlington, Vermont (Travel + Leisure) -- On a recent afternoon along Church Street in Burlington, Vermont, young aspiring actors recited passages from Shakespeare's Henry V as jugglers, break-dancers, and blowers of didgeridoos displayed their skills nearby, creating a visual and aural cacophony. Just another day in a thriving college town -- this one happening to be home to the University of Vermont. There are notable distinctions between college towns and other American cities. In the student-centric spots, bicycles seem to outnumber cars. Affordable restaurants serve up authentic cuisines from all around the world. The streets are densely packed with businesses, making for a highly pedestrian-friendly environment. Nature is usually accentuated: the shimmering Lake Champlain, backdropped by a sawtooth silhouette of peaks, forms the western edge of Burlington. Madison, Wisconsin, is situated on an isthmus between two lakes that draw hordes of hikers and bikers. Boulder, Colorado, is an outdoor enthusiast's dream. And don't forget the bars. Each of these locales offers plenty of opportunities for imbibing, many of them ideal for both people-watching and soaking in the scenery. It's hard to beat sunset cocktails at Austin's Oasis, where tiered decks jut from a 450-foot-high cliff over Lake Travis. These attractions are mainly geared toward the students, naturally, but they can be readily enjoyed by those with no homework assignments or college connections. After all, few sports experiences can top the rafter-shaking raucousness in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, during a Tar Heels basketball game. Many schools benefit from world-class art collections in glittering facilities designed by marquee architects; Chapel Hill's Ackland Art Museum, featuring a wing by Polshek Partnership, tempts visitors with Warhols, Titians, and Dalís in a way that many university-less cities cannot. The performing arts also abound. Most campuses host an array of dance, theater, and performing arts to rival a season at Lincoln Center. Not to mention rock. This fall, for instance, the Boulder Theater, near the University of Colorado, will host the Psychedelic Furs, Aimee Mann, and Dinosaur Jr. So, as students zip up their backpacks for a return to the classroom, it's a good time for any traveler to pack up a trunk and visit one of these bustling campus locations. Just don't count on peace and quiet if you go to bed early. Oxford, Mississippi (University of Mississippi) On autumn Saturdays when Vaught-Hemingway Stadium is packed with 65,000 whooping fans, it may be tough to associate Oxford with anything but football. But in a place named for a scholarly English city and that is home to William Faulkner's columned retreat, Rowan Oak, paperbacks take precedence over quarterbacks, especially at Square Books. Its tens of thousands of volumes include autographed copies of works by southern authors like Eudora Welty. When not reading, residents pedal the city's fast-growing network of bike trails. ""I was surprised to learn Mississippi could be so progressive,"" says Kevin Stuart of Oxford Bicycle Company. Local taste: Act the southern gentleman on the upstairs porch at City Grocery by ordering a ""Just North of South"" bourbon mojito. Olympia, Washington (Evergreen State College) State capitals and colleges fit together seamlessly in a number of locales (see Austin and Madison). Olympia nicely mixes buttoned-up government workers and dreadlocked students. It's hard to miss the Capitol Campus -- you can see the legislative building's sandstone dome from almost anywhere in the city. Take a guided tour, and then stroll through the lovely conservatory and gardens. Every Earth Day, the Procession of the Species parade, with participants colorfully dressed as birds, turtles, killer whales and more, weaves through downtown -- near where Harlequin Productions draws theatergoers to its unconventional shows at the State Theater. Local taste: Though vegetarians are plentiful in Olympia, shellfish fans are, too; find them slurping Fanny Bays, from the British Columbia bay of the same name, at the Oyster House. Charlottesville, Virginia (University of Virginia) The music scene was fertile here B.D.M.B -- that is, before the Dave Matthews Band, which formed in Charlottesville in the early 1990s. These days, alternative rock, country, and reggae acts -- as well as, of course, jam bands -- get crowds moving at the Charlottesville Pavilion, the Paramount Theater, and even Scott Stadium, where U2 arrives in October. But the best performances may lurk along the brick sidewalks of the postcard-perfect downtown, in tiny venues like Miller's, a former drugstore that's now known for jazz and blues. When the music's over, be sure to get a good look at the Thomas Jefferson -- planned campus and explore a Blue Ridge Mountain trail. Local taste: Matthews, who was born in Johannesburg, might enjoy the ""boerie burgers"" at the Shebeen, a South African restaurant. Austin, Texas (University of Texas) Texas's retro-stylish capital prides itself on turning out offbeat characters -- Willie Nelson and Matthew McConaughey, for starters. But for something truly batty, check out the Ann Richards/Congress Avenue Bridge, where 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats hang out -- quite literally. At dusk, from March through October, they flap off to chase insects. Viewed from a lawn below next to Lady Bird Lake, the swarm will blot out the sunset. Austin, the so-called live music capital of the world, turns into a music fanatic's dream each March during the SXSW festival. Local taste: Go for some Texas barbecue at the low-key Artz Rib House, where for $16.99 you can get messy with a full rack of baby-back ribs. Sip alfresco drinks and take in the sunset at Oasis, where tiered decks jut out from a 450-foot-high cliff over Lake Travis. Burlington, Vermont (University of Vermont) College towns don't get more scenic than Burlington, where a 7.5-mile bike path on old railroad beds provides wind-riffled views of Lake Champlain. It's understandable, then, that outdoor activities figure prominently here. Rent a kayak from Umiak to explore bays fringed with pines, or hike Burrow's Trail to the summit of nearby Camel's Hump, whose bald-faced 4,083-foot summit offers living-map panoramas. Local taste: Dine on local delicacies at the Green Room, which offers locavore favorites like Vermont lamb braised with green peppercorns. Boulder, Colorado (University of Colorado) In a town that always pops up on ""healthiest cities in America"" lists, bike trails are abundant and outdoor options are endless. The Wild West begins along Baseline Road in Boulder, in the foothills of the Rockies known as the Flatirons, for their sharply angled faces. Rent climbing shoes from Neptune Mountaineering, whose in-store museum features dozens of ice axes and an early pair of Rossignol skis. Local taste: The Chautauqua National Historic Landmark, built in the 1800s as a Methodist retreat, now serves up salmon with salsa verde on a wraparound porch. The on-site summer-camp-type cottages provide eagle-eye views toward the flatlands. Berkeley, California (University of California) If coffee shops define a good college town, Berkeley has the competition beat. Some host bands, others show art, many sell fair-trade blends, and most offer a space where it's okay to relax for hours. ""It's kind of a universal hangout place, not just for professors and students,"" says Erik Hvezda, a barista at Brewed Awakening. Many residents prefer the crackle of vinyl to MP3s; pick up some LPs at the well-stocked Amoeba Music on Telegraph Avenue, Berkeley's festive commercial strip. In the heart of campus, the 61-bell carillon provides the tunes atop 307-foot Sather Tower, which also offers stunning panoramas of San Francisco Bay. Local taste: For brunch, fit in with the crunchy crowd by ordering a tofu scramble at Venus. For some local suds, stop in for pints at the festive Pyramid Brewery. Ann Arbor, Michigan (University of Michigan) If a town's name references trees, it's a good bet nature will figure prominently. At the lush, 123-acre Nichols Arboretum, gravel paths wind past blazes of yellow, pink, and white peonies and the occasional reclining student. The ""Arb"" is also frequently the setting for Shakespeare stagings. Slake your thirst amid more flora at Dominick's, whose garden is ideal for enjoying any of the 10 local microbrews on tap. Local taste: Apart from the various Wolverines sports teams, the pride of Ann Arbor is Zingerman's Roadhouse, where the rooftop vintage neon sign reads ""Really Good American Food."" And that's what you'll get, of every type, from New Mexican chiles to oysters from Apalachicola, FL. Madison, Wisconsin (University of Wisconsin) Like oases in deserts, college towns in the Midwest can be refreshing splashes of hustle and bustle amid the plains. The Wisconsin capital squeezes cafés, art galleries, and the César Pelli -- designed Madison Museum of Contemporary Art onto an invigorating pedestrian-only thoroughfare. In warm weather, the museum's roof is the setting for concerts and films. Elsewhere are found lively neighborhood block parties, like the Atwood Summerfest, which annually offers rock bands on multiple stages. And there's no shortage of aquatic fun: the city is located on an isthmus between a pair of glittering lakes. Local taste: L'Etoile Restaurant is the region's slow-food mecca. Chapel Hill, North Carolina (University of North Carolina) Yes, there's a fine clutch of Georgian classroom buildings around a shaded, picturesque quad, but during the winter months, everyone's attention is fixated on the Dean Dome, home to the powerhouse Tar Heels basketball team. Come November, tickets that haven't been snapped up by students are available to the public. Die-hards check out the 8,000-square-foot, year-old Carolina Basketball Museum, which doubles as a de facto shrine to alum Michael Jordan (old jerseys included). Still, nothing beats game time, says ticket director John Miller: ""It's really just electric."" During the off-season, browse for art at Red Window, owned by Elizabeth Edwards, wife of former senator John Edwards. Local taste: Though the building's a flyspeck, the long lines of cars at the drive-through window of the Sunrise Biscuit Kitchen testify to the restaurant's celebrated sweet tea and fried chicken.

"(Budget Travel) -- Happy family cruises are all alike because they allow parents and kids to each be happy in his or her own way. A parent of a toddler, for instance, might be happiest with a cruise that provides trustworthy child-care services at flexible hours. Children, of course, have their own priorities. A teen, say, will probably want lots of activities for socializing after 10 P.M. Disney's cruises top the list for families with younger children. We scoured the top cruise lines to find the best ones for children, grouping them by age group: infants and toddlers, kids ages 3 to 7, ages 8 to 11, and ages 12 to 17. See our picks below. One thing: We haven't sailed every cruise available out of U.S. ports though we're working on it. For activities we didn't have personal experience with, we relied on the knowledge of parents and teens with whom we've talked about cruising, such as those who participated in our recent online chat about family cruising. Despite our connections, we may have overlooked some great activities. Let us know what we've missed by e-mailing us at Letters@BudgetTravelOnline.com. Infants and Toddlers . 1. Disney Cruise Line The fully equipped nurseries are a dead giveaway: Disney's ships outperform every other major cruise line in offering services for children who are at least 12 weeks old and less than 3 years old. It's the little details that count. Each Disney stateroom has a bathroom with a bathtub, for instance. And, as every parent knows, a bathtub is easier to use than a shower when caring for infants and toddlers. Yet most other cruise ships only offer showers in their rooms, unless you purchase one of their costly suites. Topping it all off, Disney's Magic and Wonder each have pools with separate filtration systems that allow diapered tots to swim. Disney stands out in this regard from most rival cruise lines, which generally prohibit diapers in all of their pools. (The fine print: Disney's nurseries charge a fee of $6 per hour per child. A tip: Reserve the hours when you'd like to leave your little one in the nursery as soon as you embark.) 2. Carnival Cruise Lines This is one of the few lines whose youth counselors change diapers when necessary. Carnival also stands out because its youth programs accept kids starting at age 2. In contrast, most programs elsewhere require that children be age 3 and fully potty trained. An added plus is that after 10 P.M. Carnival's ships offers group babysitting for children under age 2. You can even rent strollers. Group babysitting for those under age 2 costs $6 per hour for the first child and $4 for each additional child. These prices also apply for group babysitting of toddlers who are more than 2 years old. (See the Carnival section, under Children Ages 3 to 7 below.) Stroller rentals: All Carnival ships rent strollers (both single and double ones) on board. The fee is $6 per day on the three- and four-day itineraries and $25 per cruise for lengthier trips. 3. Holland America Line No matter that its youth programming doesn't admit children under age 3. Holland America still scores points for encouraging toddlers and parents to play together in groups at scheduled times. What's more, Holland America joins Disney in being one of the few cruise lines to offer private babysitting for an hourly fee. (Private babysitting costs $8 per hour for the first child in a family and $5 per hour per sibling.) Here's another nice gesture: If you're traveling with an infant or toddler, tell your agent upon booking and he or she will send you a detailed request form so you can order baby food, diapers, and wipes. For a fee, this unique service delivers the food and other items to your cabin along with a mini fridge so that you don't have to haul baby supplies to the ship. (The fine print: Parents must fill out an infant services order form 30 days prior to a North American sailing or 60 days prior to other sailings. Baby supply service fees: diapers, $1 each; a pack of 80 wipes, $5; jars of baby food, $1 each; and refrigerator rental, $2 per day.) Children Ages 3 to 7 . 1. Disney If your kids enjoy Disney characters and movies, they'll love this cruise line. In a much more intimate setting than the Disney theme parks provide, you and your children can enjoy free meals with costumed characters, including tea with Wendy (from Peter Pan). You can also see elaborate stage shows, such as Disney Dreams, that showcase popular Disney characters, like Captain Hook and Snow White. 2. Carnival A family welcome aboard party and a kids' talent show are but two examples of the long list of familiy activities this cruise line offers. Upstaging other cruise lines, Carnival offers the most hours of youth programs. And after its free youth program ends at 10 P.M. daily, group babysitting is available for an hourly fee until 3 A.M. nightly. Younger kids also enjoy the enthusiastic youth counselors who, on some ships, even let children paint their faces. 3. Royal Caribbean International Here you'll find a youth program, called Adventure Ocean, that excels at offering age-appropriate, hands-on activities, such as art projects, science experiments, and drama classes (developed in partnership with Camp Broadway). On two specific ships Freedom of the Seas and Liberty of the Seas outdoor water parks attract youngsters. Children Ages 8 to 11 . 1. Royal Caribbean This fleet of ships offers rock walls (as opposed to boulders). The kids are harnessed in, and trained staff members hold the ropes for kids when they need to climb down. Non-climbing options include miniature-golf courses and ice-skating rinks on Royal Caribbean's biggest ships. (The fine print: Kids must be at least 6 years old to climb walls, and parents must sign a waiver. Children can't climb the same route on the wall at the same time as their parents. If they want to climb with their parents, they need to climb next to the route that their parents are climbing.) 2. Princess Cruises Older grade school children enjoy Princess' hands-on science program, run with the help of the California Science Center. Some fun projects include dissecting squid and constructing replica roller coasters (as part of a lesson on centrifugal force). The youth program also offers plenty of group games and crafts that aren't tied to science. 3. Disney The cruise ship Magic recently added a room called Ocean Quest, boasting a ship's bridge simulator, which kids can use to pretend they are navigating a ship. The room is also packed with plenty of video games for multiple players. On the Magic and Wonder, kids ages 8 and 9 can visit the Oceaneer Lab, which offers lots of hands-on activities, such as science experiments and mock forensics. Teenagers Ages 12 to 17 . 1. Royal Caribbean The staff on this fleet wisely splits teens into two groups: ages 12 to 14 and 15 to 17. Each ship has a dedicated teen room. And six ships (Freedom, Liberty, Mariner, Navigator, Sovereign, and Majesty of the Seas) have as many as three teens-only areas: Fuel nightclub, Back Deck for outdoor sunning, and Living Room for hanging out. Activities include high-energy teen programming, such as scavenger hunts and a mock assassin game, plus outdoor facilities (especially on the cruise line's largest ships) for surfing and playing basketball. A new popular activity is on-board surfing. The Liberty of the Seas and Freedom of the Seas each have a FlowRider. Kids or adults can ride a continuous wave, created by a six-inch sheet of water that rushes up an incline to keep surfers in position. The FlowRider is the exact opposite of ocean surfing, where you move with the wave. It's like wakeboarding, without the boots and the lines. 2. Carnival Over the past few years, this cruise line has revamped its programs for kids ages 15 to 17. As a rule, each of its ships has a dedicated room for teens called Club 02. The 1,000--1,800-square-foot room boasts high-tech sound and lighting equipment. The room also features video games and movies on large-screen plasma TVs. Carnival is the only cruise line that lets kids ages 12 to 17 participate in shore excursions as separate teen groups, which go ashore under the leadership of a teen counselor. The cost of the teen shore excursions in the Caribbean, for example, range from $40 to $80, depending on the tour and the port. 3. Holland America All of this cruise line's ships (except for the small Prinsendam) feature The Loft, a dedicated teen area that resembles an artists' loft and features the Dance Dance Revolution video game and karaoke machines. On all ships except Maasdam, Noordam, Oosterdam, Zuiderdam, Westerdam, and Prinsendam, there's a special passageway that connects The Loft to The Oasis, an outdoor hangout space for teens, which features a waterfall, a wading pool, a juice bar, and lounge chairs.

"(CNN)  -- My journey of faith began at age 11 when I began to study the Bible, inspired by Audrey Hepburn in ""The Nun's Story"" and enamored of Jeffrey Hunter in ""King of Kings."" I yearned for the passion and devotion of faith, as expressed Hollywood-style, to deal with my isolation as a child of mixed ethnicity in a black and white world. I did not fit anywhere, and the path of faith seemed to offer the greatest sense of belonging. My African-American father, a lifelong Methodist, and my Japanese mother, without a particular faith, insisted that my siblings and I attend church regularly -- even if they didn't. Because we were in the military, we were exposed to various religions: I explored Catholic and Protestant traditions, as well as Judaism. I had many questions and could not accept faith without understanding. Then, when I was 13, my mother's friend invited me to a Buddhist meeting. My mother warned me not to join anything, but I was moved by the beauty of the chanting of ""Namu Myoho Renge Kyo,"" known as the Odaimoku or sacred title of the Lotus Sutra. Naturally, because I was told not to, I joined. It was the beginning of a journey culminating in my ordination as a priest in the Nichiren Shu tradition. Within the Nichiren Order, I am the first woman of Japanese and African descent, the only ordained Western woman and the first female priest in the Nichiren Order of North America. Buddhism has been the mainstay of my life, enabling me to understand life's reality and providing a practice of faith to deal with that reality. I have learned to release the past and not give in to imagination or the future. Buddhism taught me that there is only now, the present moment. Most people understand the law of cause and effect, or very simply ""What goes around, comes around."" When I asked the question ""Why is this happening to me?"" as I explored various faiths, I never received an answer that made sense. Buddhism taught me that my life is the result of causes made in the past and my future would be the result of causes made in the present. The Lotus Sutra, which outlines the path of the bodhisattvas, or those who forgo their own enlightenment to assist others on the path, helped me see that I made the cause to come into this life to fulfill a mission. My personal struggles in life provided me the experience and knowledge to be a bridge for others to find liberation. Buddhist practice around basic concepts has meant liberation from suffering discrimination, racism and even the loneliness of being the only one. Once I applied the concepts, I gained greater understanding that my suffering had purpose, and I could use that suffering to help others. I understood the impermanence of suffering and that being attached to my suffering only created more. My work within the prison system is a direct result of being able to see the Buddha nature within each person. Five years ago, sangha members and I (three women of color) encountered a group of white male inmates, some of whom were white supremacists. All of us were quite surprised, but slowly we developed loving, compassionate relationships through which all of us were able to abandon our preconceptions about each other. Today, our prison group contains people from African, Latino, Asian and European backgrounds, and our conversations touch on the issues of racism and prejudice as well as the development of faith. Society holds some people I've met in contempt and hatred; I have seen them grow and find value in themselves even as I grew to love each one of them. Of the seven released since 2005, three are known to have continued in practice, and only one has re-offended. The practice of Buddhism has much to offer communities of color; however, it may be difficult to find teachers and practitioners with the necessary experience. There is no national directory. We exist in myriad traditions and cities throughout the U.S. Ordination in many traditions is often difficult and expensive, and finding teachers willing and able to address issues relative to being African-American is sometimes impossible. Yet, progress is being made as we create sanghas within communities of color and assume the roles of clergy and lay teachers. It is definitely time for practitioners of color to step up and make ourselves known. Our communities need us to be present now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Myokei Caine-Barrett.","Lynda Caine-Barrett, of African and Japanese descent, was a spiritual seeker .

"(CNN) -- A lesbian couple have applied to adopt a child after Florida's child advocacy agency announced it won't fight a court ruling that found the state's ban on such adoptions unconstitutional. Jennifer Haseman and Hillary Jovi, who were unaware of Tuesday's announcement by the state, called Family Services of Metro Orlando, central Florida's child protective contractor, to begin the process of adoption. The couple believed they could make their dream a reality after a September decision by the Third District Court of Appeal that lifted Florida's three-decade ban on gay adoption. ""We've wanted to adopt ever since we discussed wanting a family,"" said Jovi, who said she has had a 12-year relationship with Haseman. ""We always wanted to have our own children and adopt."" The couple, formerly from New York, had considered moving back there just for the opportunity to adopt a child. Both women have battled infertility. The Florida Department of Children and Families said any appeal by the state agency was likely to be unsuccessful following opinions from the appeal court and a circuit court judge in Miami, Florida. Gov. Charlie Crist ordered the department to stop enforcing the ban after the circuit court ruling. ""I don't think for us it is about sexual orientation so much as it is about a kid that deserves a second chance with a good parent or parents,"" said DCF spokeswoman Carrie Hoeppner. The ACLU of Florida represented licensed foster parent Frank Martin Gill, who wanted to adopt two boys who had been placed in his care after the Department of Children and Families removed them from their home for neglect. He sued to have the adoption ban overturned. ""We are happy to hear that DCF wants to bring this case to an end and allow the Gill family to get on with their lives,"" said Howard Simon, ACLU of Florida executive director. But, the director says, the case is not yet final. ""What is needed now is a similar statement from Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum that will formally end this case and allow judges to decide -- on a case-by-case basis -- what is in the best interests of children."" Ryan Wiggins, spokeswoman for McCollum, said, ""We appreciate the announcement, and look forward to a conversation with DCF about what the next actions will be."" The attorney general office has until October 22 to file an appeal. Florida was the only remaining state to prohibit gay adoption. The state agency said Wednesday it has removed from adoption forms the question about an applicant's sexual orientation. Jovi, an event planner and Haseman, a restaurant manager, said Monday they plan to attend an orientation class as the first step to become approved for adoption. Haseman said, ""I think it's going to be a really, really, great thing to just be able to help a child that needs a place, a home and needs love.""","Couple file to adopt in Florida, hours after a state announcement on the issue .

"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents and producers share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN's Soledad O'Brien and Stan Wilson visited San Quentin for ""Black in America: The Black Man"" which rebroadcasts tonight at 8 p.m. ET. ""I want to have everything that an average American would want,"" said Chris Shurn who served time in prison. OAKLAND, California (CNN) -- Chris Shurn walked out of San Quentin Prison in June after serving four years of hard time for possession of crack cocaine and a weapon charge. He joined at least 3,000 men paroled each year in Oakland, California, where the recidivism rate is more than 50 percent. When our documentary team first met Shurn inside San Quentin in 2008, he considered himself one of the lucky ones. At 21, he entered prison with a fourth-grade education, but left with a GED certificate and was only a few semesters short of earning an associate degree. Shurn told us there were few role models around him as a kid. He said his father left home before he entered the first grade, his mother was a crack addict and he was surrounded by a lot of violence. Ironically, San Quentin is where Shurn met the kind of role models he said he needed to break the cycle of incarceration. His hard work and determination to change caught the eye of Everett Highbaugh, who runs a program called Project Choice. Twice a week, Highbaugh goes into San Quentin with the goal of transforming men like Shurn from drug entrepreneurs to business entrepreneurs. Upon his release, Shurn replaced his dreadlocks and prison uniform with casual attire and a neatly manicured haircut. He said he felt relieved after the harsh conditions of prison life, but said he struggles every day in his Oakland neighborhood to resist the temptations of making easy money by selling crack cocaine. ""I want to have a family. I want to own a house. I want to have everything that an average American would want; a good-paying job, a career,"" he said. But the odds are against him. Nearly 1 million black men are behind bars, an especially crippling blow to black communities, where one in three black men will have a prison record in their lifetimes. They leave behind communities filled with fear, broken families and a generation of vulnerable children. After Shurn left San Quentin, Highbaugh was in contact with him twice a week and helped him land a part-time job at Goodwill Industries. At Goodwill, Shurn spent 30 hours a week in a labor-intensive job, stacking goods and preparing them for shipment. ""I remember reading a lot of these very same books in prison,"" said Shurn as he was busy working. He was grateful to have a job, but frustrated because it paid so little, $7 an hour. That job lasted only a few months. When we caught up with him in January, he had been unemployed for a while. As he sat in Oakland's Oracle Arena watching the inauguration of President Barack Obama, he wondered how he was going to help support his girlfriend and her daughter and earn enough tuition money to continue working toward his degree. Shurn has moved a few times, but is still hoping for success, still fighting against long odds, particularly in a severely debilitated job market. He's hopeful that his hard work and the skills he learned through Project Choice will be a much better alternative than making easy money on the street -- a certain pathway back to prison. ""Every day of my life, with or without work, I feel vulnerable,"" said Shurn. ""Instead of waking up every day and going to a 9-to-5; I used to wake up and go outside and sell some drugs and have my money for a whole week."" ""It crosses my mind, but I got to a point where I'm disciplined and don't need to venture into it."" A few weeks ago, Shurn was hired as a courier for a local printing business. The job pays $9 per hour; $2 more than his previous job. He says the new job won't be enough to pay all the bills, but his goal is to build a résumé so future employers will take a chance on an ex-convict who's trying to recover from a mistake that cost him four years of his life.","Chris Shurn served four years in San Quentin Prison .

"Devecser, Hungary (CNN) -- Rescue workers searched Wednesday for six elderly people missing at Kolontar, one of three villages in southwest Hungary that was hit Monday by a wave of toxic red sludge from an alumina plant reservoir that burst. Wearing chemical protection suits, the workers used metal sticks to poke through muck three-feet deep (1 meter) for the presumed victims, reported MTI, Hungary's official news agency. At least 116 people were injured, eight of them seriously, when the mishap occurred Monday afternoon, the agency said. Most of them were flown to hospitals in the capital, Budapest. The reservoir has been repaired and the flow from the pool has halted. But the material that flowed out of the reservoir continued to pose a threat. On Wednesday, more than 500 National Disaster Management Authority staffers and soldiers and employees of Hungarian Aluminum Production and Trade Company (MAL), the company that owns the alumina plant's reservoir, were trying to halt the advance of the sludge before it reaches the Danube River's tributaries, said Jeno Lasztovicza, head of the defense committee, according to MTI. The sludge had already reached the Marcal River, which flows into the River Raba, which empties into the Danube. It was expected to show up in the Danube as soon as this weekend, said Imre Szakacs, head of Gyor-Moson-Sopron County's defense authority, MTI said. Emergency workers were pouring plaster and fertilizers into the Marcal River in hopes that it would bind with the sludge and counter its alkalinity before it reached the Danube, the continent's second-longest river, some 70 km (43 miles) north, reported MTI. But the material will have been neutralized by the time it reaches the Raba, Interior Minister Sandor Pinter told reporters. Untreated, the sludge contains heavy metals, which cause burns and eye irritation, he said. Four people -- two children ages 1 and 3, an elderly woman and a 35-year-old man whose SUV overturned in the sludge -- have been confirmed dead in the environmental disaster, which occurred 160 km (99 miles) west of Budapest, near the town of Ajka. Residents were advised not to eat produce from gardens that were covered when the dam burst, releasing at least 1 million cubic meters of thick red mud. It was not clear when residents evacuated from affected areas in the villages of Kolontar, Devecser and Somlovasarhely would be able to return home, nor were the long-term consequences clear. A state of emergency has been declared in three counties, the State Secretariat of Governmental Communications said. In a statement on its website, MAL said it ""offers its honest condolences to the relatives of all of the victims who lost their lives in the catastrophe.""

"(CNN) -- The Middle East may be awash with cash, but that didn't stop the region's stock markets being swept up in the global gloom that engulfed investors around the world this week. Traders at the Kuwait Stock Exchange in happier times -- this week Kuwait's main index fell four percent. The region's share markets tumbled in a Mexican wave of selling that started in the U.S. and quickly spread to Asia and Europe. In the Middle East, the Saudi stock market suffered some of the biggest falls; dropping ten percent in Tuesday's trade, its largest one-day slump on record. ""It highlights the extent to which international investors have really come into the market during the course of 2007,"" says Anais Faraj, Nomura's Executive Director of Investment Banking for the Middle East. ""What you're seeing now is that international investors who might have lost money in the sell-off in the U.S. and Europe cashing in where they've made some profits to staunch their wounds."" On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve shocked the market with its own measure to stem the sell-off. It cut interest rates by 75 percentage points to 3.5 percent, its biggest single cut in since October 1984, and the first between scheduled meetings since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. And it worked. Markets in the Middle East clawed back lost ground, but it also forced the hand of the region's central bankers whose currencies are pegged to the dollar. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain all cut key interest rates in tandem with the U.S., and Oman was expected to follow. Despite having dropped its peg with the dollar last May, Kuwait also cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in eighteen months. Kuwait Central Bank Governor Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah is quoted as saying: ""The measure aims at reducing any negative impact that could arise from unjustified high margins between the interest rate on the dinar and international currencies."" While it may solve one problem, it only exacerbates another: Inflation. ""We are seeing a policy from the Fed, which is fully appropriate for the U.S. economy, being imported into the Gulf,"" says Marios Maratheftis, Regional Head of Research for Middle East for Standard Chartered. ""Unfortunately what is good for the U.S. is not good for the Gulf economy,"" he says. ""Inflation is already high and it's already a concern, but something that concerns me the most is not so much the present inflation, it's the inflation expectations we're seeing."" He says the Gulf governments need to act, and if they're not prepared to drop their peg with the dollar, they must consider revaluing their currencies. ""The choice to proceed with a one-off valuation of the currencies would help to drain some of the liquidity out of the system. It would send a message to the economy participants in the region that there is a response to the inflationary pressures."" While this week's turmoil in the world financial markets may have been a curse for the Gulf economies, it could also be viewed as a potential blessing for the region's sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). As little as two weeks ago, they were in the market buying shares in leading U.S. banks Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. For them, the sell-off has created more buying opportunities. ""Where there is more risk and less certainty and less leverage available these guys are going to come in and support the stock market. From what we've seen, they're certainly ready to go out shopping,"" says Anais Faraj from Nomura. The chief of the Kuwait Investment Authority confirmed as much on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Bader Al Sa'ad is reported to have said he viewed the sell-off as a ""pure investment opportunity"", citing the financial and real estate sectors as areas of interest. After much speculation, Saudi Arabia has confirmed it is considering launching its first sovereign wealth fund, a $6 billion investment pot accrued during the oil boom. However, the Vice Governor of the Kingdom's Central Bank Mohammed Al-Jasser is reported to have said Saudi Arabia ""can live without one"" if there's ""endless debate about abuses."" Read more about calls for greater SWF transparency . Marios Maratheftis from Standard Chartered says the flow of funds from the Gulf to the West will help to correct the current imbalance in the global economy. ""There's a shift of wealth. Asia and the Middle East are becoming richer and more important global powers. It's a fact and it's happening,"" he says. ""The surplus countries need to recycle their income into the deficit countries. These flows are being translated into the action of the sovereign wealth funds.

"(CNN) -- My name is Anne Feeley. I am an American, a mother, a feminist, a baker, a wife, an atheist and a liberal Democrat. I am also a brain cancer survivor and an activist for brain cancer research and patient care. But when I fill out the Census, all it will reflect is that I am a 55-year-old white woman, and nothing about how I got to this point in life. When I was growing up in Newark, New Jersey, in the '60s and '70s, America was in a state of flux. Everywhere you looked, there were battles going on as traditional beliefs were being challenged. I knew I was an American, but I also wanted America to change. On television and in the media, men and women were arguing about their roles, whites and blacks were arguing about racism, people were demonstrating against the Vietnam War and wondering if God was dead. The very idea that everything can be challenged and changed is America to me. I suspect the sides I took in those early years define me. It was exciting, and a lot of good came of it, and also some bad. That's the way of it. Always. After graduating from East Orange Catholic High School, I moved to Boston, Massachusetts. Seven years later, I attended Wellesley College as a continuing education student. This chance for later education, to change the direction of one's life, is wonderfully American. While in Boston, I met my husband. When our daughters were 1 and 4 years old, we moved to Prague, Czechoslovakia. We always wanted to experience Europe, and we thought if not now, never. We lived in Prague for almost 15 years. The kids went to Czech schools and then to international schools. I opened and ran Bakeshop Praha. I was an American living abroad. Life was good. Then five years ago, I was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme brain cancer. The doctors told me the grim prognosis: I should prepare to die. My mother died when I was young, and the worst part of the diagnosis was thinking I would leave my daughters with that pain. I also wanted to be a good example. I wanted to live. I had surgery to remove the tumor. The week I got out of the hospital, I began exercising. While the staples were still in my head, through the radiation and chemotherapy, I exercised. I was so lucky that I was able to. Very slowly, I got stronger. That first year, I did a half-marathon. Not fast, but I did it. After the surgery and the radiation and the 2½ years of chemo, I was pronounced ""in remission."" During this time, as I split my time between homes in London, England, and New York City,  I did several 10K races, indoor rowing competitions, and the UK Three Peaks Challenge. These events transformed my life physically, emotionally and spiritually. Brain cancer was a wake-up call for our whole family. The shock wasn't that I was going to die, but that I had forgotten that I was going to die. We all are. Life isn't a dress rehearsal. I had been attending the American Brain Tumor Association's Brain Cancer Walk in Chicago, Illinois, for three years when I realized that I had become a long-term survivor. And I realized I wanted to help change the statistics. Brain cancer patients need new, better treatments, and for that, we need more research. To help raise awareness and funds to battle brain cancer, I formed Brains on Bikes. The project consists of me and my trainer and friend Gundula cycling from San Francisco, California, across America to Washington, D.C. We started Friday and aim to finish on July 15. My very American life has taught me to try to change things that don't work. I truly believe that together, we can outsmart brain cancer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anne Feeley.","Anne Feeley grew up in New Jersey in '60's, '70s; knew she wanted America to change .

"New York (CNN) -- Who am I? I used to think the simplest explanation was black and white. But I've recently discovered that the truth is much more colorful. Because I've spent most of my adult life being mistaken for everything but who I am -- Moroccan, Brazilian, mixed African-American and white American, Israeli, Palestinian, the list goes on -- the very question has inspired me to embark on a travel adventure back through time in search of answers. This is what I know for sure: Ethnically, I am a New York City born woman of Dominican parentage. I self identify as a Latina, Dominican-American and Latino-American, interchangeably. But racially, through the science of DNA testing and tracing my family's own migration story, I've begun to receive confirmation of what I've always believed to be true not only for myself but many of the 47 million-plus Latino-Americans across the country: the subject of race in our community is kaleidoscopic, more complicated than what the census 2010 checkboxes offer. Last year, as part of a documentary project I began developing, my father and I took ancestral DNA tests. Our racial background had become somewhat of an urban myth in my family: are we Jewish, African, Spanish, aliens perhaps? Instead of checking off the usual black, white and American Indian options I've become way too comfortable with because of my racial ambiguity, I decided it was time to solve my familial puzzle and, at once, break out of the Other box. I found out through Bennett Greenspan, founder of the Houston based commercial genetic genealogy company, Family Tree DNA, was that who I am is ""the face of miscegenation in the New World."" And the journey is just beginning. My mother's mother's mother's direct maternal line is L3d, a subgroup of African descent, (we found matches in Guinea-Bissau). My father's maternal ancestry is Native American, from an ""extremely rare"" line of Amerindians. Finally, my father's paternal lineage is Arabic, perhaps Berber, entering Spain through North Africa. With a growing number of Latinos becoming vested in discovering their ancestral roots -- a Tejana friend of mine from Austin, Texas, recently learned she belongs to a Central Asian group that reputedly descends from Genghis Khan -- the subject of race within our community will enable us to self-identify in ways our parents' generation could only dream of. As our numbers grow to more than 130 million in the next several decades, so will the racial landscape of the nation shift radically. One may offer a convincing argument about health care and the economy being more worthwhile issues uniting and affecting all Americans. But race still matters. Couple anti-immigration hysteria and a 41 percent spike in hate crimes against Latinos over the past six years with a troubled economy, and one may find a pressure cooker waiting to explode. While the census form is supposed to help show the sociopolitical climate and composition of America, it only underscores how out of touch its architects truly are. From the reintroduction of the offensive term ""Negro"" that will undoubtedly put off many Latino-Americans, to the failed attempt at engaging the hip-hop generation with a cloying rap commercial, the U.S. Census Bureau is alienating the very people it's spending millions of dollars trying to target. On the one hand, it's important for every citizen to be counted because the information collected determines how $400 billion dollars of federal funding is allocated to public schools, hospitals, job training centers and more. However, the hotly debated question number 9 on the census only serves to prove that even after making history by electing our first African and white-American president, our society has only managed to place a ""post-racial"" Band-Aid over the subject of race in the United States. While we collectively continue to ignore the festering wound, I intend on honoring my ancestors on the census form by rejecting the term ""Negro"" and opting to identify my African, Amerindian and Arabic roots by filling in the blanks under ""some other race."" I hope by the time the next census rolls around, we'll realize the ideal of living in a post-racial society by recognizing that our citizens are more diverse than the flat picture that's being drawn now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Raquel Cepeda.","Raquel Cepeda says she identifies as a Latina and a Dominican-American .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- It is twilight at Dodger Stadium, and a small army of U.S. Census workers has gathered in the vast empty parking lot. Their mission this spring evening is to find and count the tens of thousands of homeless people who call Los Angeles home. Christina Coffey is one of the newly minted census workers who will be hitting the streets and gathering information. She will be helping the homeless men and women living on skid row and in shelters to fill out their census forms. Not everyone she meets will be agreeable, but Coffee says she doesn't mind. ""I am very happy to have this job,"" said the 28-year-old Los Angeles native. ""I come from a great background,"" she said. ""I have a good résumé and a good education."" But in the current economic climate, that didn't translate into a job. Coffey has been unemployed for the past two years, one of the millions affected by the recession. The nation's unemployment rate still stands at 9.7 percent after some modest job gains this year. The economy shed 8.4 million jobs from March 2008 to April 2009. But it has actually been a boon to the people responsible for compiling the 2010 census. The U.S. Census Bureau is hiring 1.2 million people to gather information for its once-a-decade headcount of the U.S. population. ""We have noticed, with the economy the way it is, the caliber of person we have recruited for this census is remarkably better than we have seen in the past,"" said James Christie, director of operations for the the U.S. census' Western region. Christie believes that this year's highly educated work force could make this census the most accurate in history. ""We have people with advanced degrees working as census-takers,"" he said. ""They may be overqualified, but they are glad to be working."" Buashie Amatokwu is one of those ""overqualified"" workers.  She has a doctorate in African history from Temple University. Now, her skills are directed toward getting an accurate count of African immigrants, residents from the Caribbean and African-American citizens. After college, Amatokwu had trouble finding employment, so she worked for a while selling financial planning services. But she wasn't satisfied as a saleswoman. Her job as a census worker has given her a new sense of direction, she said. ""I like to say that I am called to serve,"" Amatokwu said. ""That is my calling."" But her census job will end June 1. Nevertheless, she believes the experience has prepared her to move forward. ""I'm being groomed: How to handle the community, how to handle negotiations, how to handle dignitaries,"" she said. ""This has been a lesson. A big lesson."" It's a lesson that Amatokwu hopes will translate into employment in politics or the diplomatic field. Amatokwu's census job has lasted about 18 months, but most of the 1.2 million census jobs will last only a few weeks. Even though the employment is short term, Coffey sums up the attitude of most of these temporary employees: . ""I'm highly appreciative of every hour I am working and every paycheck.""","High jobless rate has been boon for U.S. Census .

"Waveland, Mississippi (CNN)  -- Tommy Longo has had a rough year: both hips, a femur and a knee replaced. When he hobbles out of his truck to see how the new City Hall construction is going, he looks with every step like he just needs to sit down.  His face is covered with perspiration in the afternoon heat, and he always seems to be headed to the next appointment. You might think the mayor of a town that disappeared would have little to do, and yet Longo seems to never stop.  ""We lost our residential structures, lost our commercial structures, lost our governmental structures,"" he says. ""Every city building was gone. Our town was obliterated. We were wiped off the face of the earth.""  For all the attention focused on New Orleans each time the anniversary of Katrina rolls around, it would be easy to forget that the epicenter of the storm was over on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  And no town was hit harder than Waveland.  Ninety-five percent of its homes were taken by the storm; 100 percent of the town's businesses. With virtually every road either broken up or piled with mountains of debris, it was difficult for recovery teams to find a starting place. And yet, Mayor Longo and a core of dedicated residents began rebuilding almost as soon as the storm passed, and for the past five years they have remained steadily at it.   With $100 million in federal disaster aid as a launching pad, they've repaired utilities, roads, schools, community centers and parks, and recovered 65 percent of the businesses they lost.   Temporary churches, often erected on the ruins of their original houses of worship, proved crucial as meeting spots and places to organize volunteers. Now some of those congregations are finally moving into new, permanent sanctuaries. Most importantly, the people are coming back. Like the businesses, about two-thirds of the population has returned.  The Kearney family, Charles, his wife Germain and their two small children, lost everything. In the immediate wake of the storm, Germain Kearney kneeled in the wreckage of her house, plucking ruined photographs from the wreckage. ""It's just blowing me away,"" she told CNN back then. ""It really is. But this has happened to other people and they've come back from it, so we're going to come back from it too."" They have done just that -- rebuilding, resettling not far from the empty lot where they used to live. Germain Kearney knows that remaining here means accepting challenges, maybe for many more years. ""I'm not complaining, but it is harder to do what we have to do. School is not around the block, school is 10 miles away.""   The nearest grocery store is every farther. Charles Kearney says they talked about leaving, ""But where were we going to go? This is home."" Back downtown, Longo stops walking long enough to answer a basic question that he's heard many times. With nothing left of the town, did it ever occur to you to give up, move away? ""It never crossed my mind that we were finished. That we were done. Never crossed my mind.""   It's more than just a commitment to a job. He is the father of seven children, all still living here. And they'll all be on hand this fall, when for the first time since the storm, his town holds a popular festival it used to enjoy every year before the storm. In the high grass at their old lot, one of the Kearney kids calls out. ""I found something!"" Even now, they discover bits of detritus tossed by the storm. His father takes a look and tells him it's just part of an old yard trimmer. ""But it is still something,"" the kids say. And this town had saved itself on the simple belief, that you can build something from nothing. They've done it.","Five years after Hurricane Katrina, Waveland, Mississippi, regains what it lost .

"(CNN)  -- I am Shane Stanford. To my family, I am a husband of 20 years and the boastful father of three. To my congregation of nearly 5,000, I am a pastor. To my readers, I am the author of nine Christian books. To my friends, I am one of the guys. And, to so many over the years who have known my story, I am a man in a race -- a race against illness, against fear, against discrimination. A race against my own body. A race against time. A hemophiliac since birth, I discovered my HIV status at 16. It was life-changing news, the result of a contaminated blood supply. And, so, the race began. It has included many twists and turns: from the joy of marrying my high school sweetheart to the sorrow of being rejected by the first church to which I was appointed as pastor. Certainly, the race has never been easy. It is often long and difficult. However, the race now impacts me in so many ways. And, oddly enough, I would not trade it with anyone. Instead, the journey affords me a glimpse into the best of what each of us can become. The race has made me a student, and no day goes by that it doesn't teach me a lesson. About time: A privilege afforded to us to make a difference in this world. About relationships: The most important things we do are not done alone. About simplicity: More, bigger, nicer, pale in comparison to gifts like sunsets and the laughter of children at play. About real meaning... and about myself: Life is more a mosaic than a measurable frame of joys and sorrows, laughter and tears. Real meaning is discovered through the composition of life's diversity. No color can adequately define a mosaic, any more than one hardship, failure or achievement can define a person's life. The diversity of these images brought together unveil who I really am. No matter how I try to describe myself, I am more than the sum of what I can say. So, I run ... for those I love and, even, for those I have never met. I run to make life matter, seeking more than the right way to go, but actually going there and watching the race mean something.","Shane Stanford is husband and father, author, and a pastor .

"(CNN) -- Unlike al Qaeda, the Pakistani Taliban organization has shown little appetite for taking its brand of jihadism beyond the borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Maybe that's changing. Certainly that's the case if the messages from the organization's leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, are to be taken at face value. ""From now on,"" he says in an audio message said to have been recorded in April, ""the main targets of our fedayeen [fighters] are American cities. This good news will be heard within some days or weeks. Today onwards, the direction of our jihad is American states and cities. Inshallah we are successful in this mission and objective."" The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, does not lack a motive to lash out. In recent months it has come under increasing pressure as the United States has intensified drone strikes and the Pakistani army has carried out offensives against the group deep inside its safe haven in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Officials are keeping an open mind about any link between the Taliban and the failed car bombing in New York last weekend. Within hours of the incident, an audio message purportedly from Qari Hussain Mehsud (a senior member of the TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack. ""This attack is a revenge for the great and valuable martyred leaders of mujahedeen,"" he said. At first intelligence analysts discounted the message (not least because of specious claims by the group in the past), but as more information emerged about the incident, it has received renewed attention. Very occasionally in the past the TTP has made threats about launching attacks overseas. Before he was killed by a drone strike last year, the group's then leader, Baitullah Mehsud (no direct relation to Hakimullah or Qari Hussain) told reporters: ""Very soon we will take revenge from Amer­ica, not in Afghanistan but in Wash­ing­ton, which will amaze the entire world."" And he added: ""The max­i­mum they can do is mar­tyr me."" They did -- but not before Mehsud made an outlandish claim that the TTP was responsible for a shooting rampage in Binghamton, New York, that left 13 people dead. (A Vietnamese immigrant carried out the attack before killing himself.) The question for counterterrorism officials now is whether the threat by Hakimullah Mehsud to attack targets in the United States is bluster or carries real menace. The TTP was officially formed in 2007 when a number of hard-line Islamist groups demanding the introduction of Sharia law in Pakistan came together in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. They had already murdered scores of tribal elders to clear the area of rival authorities. The TTP's ambitions were at first confined to the tribal territories bordering Afghanistan. But by 2009 it was challenging Pakistan's heartlands and its establishment, with attacks on police academies, government buildings and army convoys as far away as Lahore and Rawalpindi. It has also cooperated closely with the Afghan Taliban and attacked NATO convoys and pre-positioned supplies on their way to Afghanistan. But it was the Taliban's widening campaign against the state that led the Pakistani army to launch major offensives last year in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan. There has been just one documented example of the TTP showing more global ambitions. On January 19, 2008, 12 Pakistanis and two Indians were arrested in Barcelona, Spain. Ten were charged -- along with another suspect later detained in the Netherlands -- with involvement in a conspiracy to carry out suicide bomb attacks on Barcelona's subway system. Several of the conspirators had arrived from Pakistan in the weeks before they were arrested. Soon after their arrest, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said: ""The Barcelona cell appears to have ties to a terrorist training network run by Baitullah Mehsud."" Several months later a TTP spokesman, Maulvi Omar, acknowledged in a video, ""The one in Barcelona was conducted by 12 of our men. They were under pledge to Baitullah Mehsud, and TTP has already claimed responsibility because of Spain's military presence in Afghanistan."" The 11 ultimately charged were convicted and sentenced to jail terms of eight to 10 years in December last year. Much of the prosecution's case was based on an informant inside the cell who said he had been trained in the use of explosives in Waziristan, the TTP's stronghold before the Pakistani army offensive. To date, the Barcelona case remains the only credible example of the TTP's capability to take its fight overseas. But other Pakistani groups have shown an ability and desire to broaden their targets. Lashkar-e-Taiba recruited American David Headley to reconnoiter and plan an attack on the offices of the Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in 2005. He was arrested on his return to the United States last year -- before any attack was carried out -- and pleaded guilty to charges connected to the conspiracy. Headley also confessed to involvement in reconnaissance for the Mumbai attacks by Lashkar in November 2008. For its part, the TTP has developed both its alliances and capabilities closer to home, most notably joining forces with al Qaeda for the attack on a U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan that killed seven CIA employees and contractors last December. And last month it launched a complex but unsuccessful attack on the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar. Intelligence analysts believe that as the attempted car bombing in Times Square was so poorly executed, it would be surprising if the TTP were closely involved.","Officials keep open mind about any link between Taliban and failed New York car bombing .

"Jackson, Mississippi (CNN) -- LaShawn Traylor was rushed to the hospital as Hurricane Katrina was carving its way through South Florida on August 25, 2005. She couldn't breathe and she was seven months pregnant. Doctors told her she had an enlarged heart and needed an emergency Cesarean section or Traylor and her baby would die. Lorenzo Traylor was born weighing 2 pounds, 11 ounces. But LaShawn Traylor slipped into a medically induced coma and was put on a ventilator inside Methodist Hospital in east New Orleans, Louisiana, not far from the city's Lower 9th Ward. Read about another mother's separation story . As she lay in the coma, Hurricane Katrina became a monster storm and the pleas for New Orleans residents to evacuate got louder. Lionel Traylor decided he and his wife's four other children would drive to Jackson, Mississippi for a few days. ""I left a picture of Lorenzo on her chest and kissed her goodbye. I thought we'd be back in a few days,"" Lionel Traylor said. Three days later, LaShawn Traylor emerged from the coma, but she was alone. On August 28, 2005, then-New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin issued a mandatory evacuation of the city. Nurses told Traylor her premature newborn was taken to another hospital for better care. This was the beginning of Traylor's Katrina ordeal, a separation that would take months to overcome. ""When I woke up they said the storm was coming, but it was sunny outside,"" said Traylor. ""I couldn't imagine how serious it was."" The next part of the story is well documented. The storm came, the levees broke and New Orleans flooded. The bottom floors of Methodist Hospital filled with water. There was no escape for Traylor and hundreds of other patients. ""It was horrific; it was chaotic. It was something out of a horror movie,"" she said. The scene inside Methodist Hospital deteriorated with every passing hour. Without power, patients on ventilators were dying. Doctors and nurses were using their hands to keep the ventilator pumps going and patients alive. Food and water was dwindling. ""I thought I was going to die,"" Traylor said. ""It was pitch dark and it was really scary."" And in the midst of all this, Traylor couldn't stop thinking about her baby boy. She hadn't even had a chance to hold him or call him by his new name, Lorenzo. She'd been told that Lorenzo was taken to Children's Hospital. But if her world was collapsing what was happening to Lorenzo, she thought to herself. As more time passed she feared the worst. ""I thought Lorenzo was dead already,"" Traylor said. ""I thought who in the world is going to keep up with a 2-pound baby during times like this."" Two days after the storm, helicopters started landing on the rooftop of Methodist Hospital to evacuate patients. Traylor says she was airlifted and dropped off on a bridge on the western edge of New Orleans. She spent the next 18 hours sitting under a bridge, still recovering from the delivery, waiting for help. LaShawn Traylor says, ""a nurse told me she didn't think I was going to make it."" Dehydration was taking its toll. On September 1 help arrived in the form of a bus ride to the New Orleans airport and a seat on an airplane out of town. When she arrived at the airport, I was there reporting on the evacuation efforts. Traylor was in a line of female patients evacuated from the Methodist Hospital maternity ward. All the other mothers had newborn babies in their arms, LaShawn Traylor was only holding Polaroid pictures of Lorenzo. She approached me and said, ""I don't know where my baby is. I'm looking for my baby."" It was a rushed interview, the moment so chaotic that I only had time to get a few basic facts. But moments later we broadcast her story, and Traylor and the picture of her baby boy were loaded onto a plane bound for Texas. ""All they told us is you need to get out of the city. I didn't want to leave the city without knowing where my baby was; I just thought that was weird,"" Traylor said. A friend of Traylor saw the interview and relayed word to her husband, who had now gone six days without hearing a word about his wife and baby. But when Lionel Traylor finally tracked down his wife in a Red Cross shelter in Fort Worth, Texas, the most important part of the story wasn't passed along accurately. ""I thought Lorenzo was with her and when I first saw her she told me 'I don't know where the baby is' and that's when my heart sank,"" said Lionel Traylor. Aid workers and caregivers heard Traylor's story and started making an intense round of phone calls. In a September 14, 2005, posting on the website of U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess of Fort Worth, the congressman's staff detailed the efforts to track down Lorenzo. ""Lorenzo had traveled to three different hospitals during the hectic evacuation,"" according to the congressman's website. ""After 24 hours of searching...""Baby Boy Traylor"" had been located at Baton Rouge General. The moments that followed were priceless -- tears of joy followed by laughter."" The family tried to return to New Orleans, the city both LaShawn and Lionel Traylor had always called home. They returned four months after Katrina to find their home destroyed by the floodwaters. They moved into a FEMA trailer but for a family of seven it proved too difficult. ""Going back to a city that needed to be rebuilt was just too much for the kids, leaving New Orleans was really hard,"" said LaShawn Traylor. In Jackson, Mississippi, the Traylor family is flourishing. Lorenzo is healthy and 5 years old. LaShawn Traylor is 31 and returned to school, completing degrees in accounting and psychology. Lionel Traylor is a full-time pastor of The Church at Jackson. LaShawn Traylor also started a foundation helping Katrina evacuees called ""Rise Above Katrina."" The organization helps Katrina survivors find homes, rental assistance and offers financial planning. ""Life is better now,"" says LaShawn Traylor. ""What Katrina did for me was a wake-up call; it made me start to live my life in a better way. I'm living my life now with a purpose.""","Days before Katrina slammed into New Orleans, LaShawn Traylor gave birth to a son .

"(CNN) -- After dealing a walloping blow to Haiti, where at least six people died and a number of homes were destroyed, Tropical Storm Tomas weakened rapidly Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. As of 4 p.m. ET, Tomas was located about 500 miles (805 kilometers) south-southwest of Bermuda, forecasters said. It was downgraded to a tropical storm early Sunday. Its maximum sustained winds were at 60 mph (95 kph), but Tomas was not posing a threat to land. The storm was heading north-northeast at near 3 mph (6 kph). It was forecast to turn northeast or east-northeast and accelerate in the next couple of days, the Hurricane Center said in its last advisory on Tomas. Further weakening is expected, forecasters said. In Haiti, a nation still grappling with the effects of a killer earthquake and a deadly cholera outbreak this year, Tomas ruined houses and turned some streets into rivers. Six people were also killed by the storm, according to the Haitian Civil Protection Authority. January's 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed 250,000 people and left 1 million more homeless. Many of those Haitians have been living in tent camps, and aid workers had been working in recent days to move the residents to safer housing, which was difficult to find. Aid workers were already struggling to keep up with the cholera outbreak, which has killed 501 people since the first cases were reported in October. An additional 7,000 are hospitalized. The bacterial disease causes diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to deadly dehydration within hours. In Leogane, west of Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince, residents waded in knee-deep water after Tomas. Box trucks got stuck in water, said relief worker Roseann Dennery of Samaritan's Purse. While the flooding receded somewhat over the weekend, the threat of waterborne disease remained a concern. ""Samaritan's Purse is moving quickly to set up cholera treatment centers in areas where there currently aren't any, and where new cases are appearing as the bacteria continues to spread,"" Dennery said. Mudslides also remain a risk because many of the nation's mountains have been stripped of vegetation, which means rain can flow downhill relatively unimpeded, said CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. ""We could see mudslides a week after the storm has passed,"" Wolf said. Tomas has also dumped more than 10 inches of rain in the Dominican Republic. Earlier, it caused extensive damage and killed 12 people on St. Lucia and also caused damage on St. Vincent. CNN's Paula Newton contributed to this report.","NEW: Storm is expected to weaken further .

"(CNN)  -- Actor Wendell Pierce's biggest role today is running the Pontchartrain Park Community Development Corp., which is hard at work trying to rebuild the New Orleans neighborhood devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Pierce was one of the stars of HBO's ""The Wire"" and most recently played a jazz trombone player in ""Treme,"" HBO's look at New Orleans after Katrina. He talked to CNN about what it's like trying to revive ""the Park."" Pontchartrain Park was featured in Soledad O'Brien's ""CNN In America's New Orleans Rising."" CNN: Tell me about the neighborhood where you grew up. WENDELL PIERCE: Pontchartrain Park started in 1952 as a result of the civil rights movement. It was the only place where blacks were allowed during segregation to purchase post-World War II homes. Two hundred acres were given over to a golf course, with 1,000 homes around it, multidenominational churches, a university and schools. We refer to it as ""the Park,"" but I've described it as the black Mayberry. Although separate but equal, my parents' generation created something that was bucolic. It was great. It was an incubator for talent. ... It was not only an idyllic place to grow up, there were also high expectations. It was expected that everyone would go to college. In the middle of it was this wonderful golf course created by Joseph Bartholomew, who did most of the golf courses in New Orleans but couldn't play on any of them. CNN: What was it like when you first saw Pontchartrain Park after Katrina? PIERCE: It was devastation. We thought the neighborhood would never come back. And then I realized there was too much history. It was one of the most stable neighborhoods in the United States: 90 percent home ownership, less than 10 percent poverty in a city with 80 percent, no crime. I put out a call to action to people in my generation. Too many people suffered and protested and worked too hard to create Pontchartrain Park. We're not going to let this one incident destroy it. CNN: How is your initiative to bring it back going? PIERCE: It's going great. Some movement is happening with transfer of properties to us. We stand in line to get something like 250 properties, and we are up to 20 or 25 now. We put up our model homes, which are geothermal and solar. We have 200 people in line to purchase homes, and that's before any marketing. Getting the [rebuilding] money is what's holding it up. We have the properties, the homes; we have people qualified with the bank, and we are still trying to access the money. That's the last difficult step. The money to assist people comes through the state. But they keep changing the rules and the qualifications and the goal-lines all the time. So it isn't appropriated. That's because the state is hostile to the city and is trying to reappropriate the money to other parts of the state and not to the city of New Orleans. That's the political fight that you have to constantly have. Three billion dollars has been appropriated [to rebuild after Katrina] and hasn't been spent in five years and that's because there's an agenda supported by many that don't want people to move back. CNN: What are the conditions in New Orleans now? PIERCE: Right now in New Orleans, it's worse than the week of the storm. We're talking about people who own their property and who didn't receive any insurance. My parents had Allstate insurance, and they got $400 after paying premiums for 50 years. It was criminal, a criminal action. So you have people who own their property, like my parents did, whose insurance policies were not recognized. And there's $3 billion to assist them to get back in their homes, and the state is not doing anything to help them out. Why hasn't it been used? Because it's a concerted effort to reappropriate the money and keep the poor and black people out. Let's put it this way. There is no large-scale redevelopment plan by any governmental entity in Louisiana, five years after Katrina. The only large-scale thing they did was to destroy public housing and get rid of a large population of minority people and the poor. There are no large-scale initiatives. Mine is one of the largest. We plan to do 550 [homes in the Park]; compare that with the fact there are 30,000 to 50,000 blighted properties here. There is a concerted effort to redistrict the city, a concerted effort to keep thousands of people out, change the demographics of the city and hope people give up on a mass scale. In times of crisis like this, we see the best and the worst of people. It's a reminder we are not far off from the days when the ugliest aspects of the country were made into law, so it can so easily go right back into it. CNN: So who's moving into Pontchartrain Park? PIERCE: We have everyone imaginable; we have elderly, we have young couples trying to get in, we have 80-year-olds trying to get back into their properties. This is a close-knit community. Who's moving in? Look in the mirror, and that's who's in Pontchartrain Park. No matter who you are, young or old, it's a diverse group of people, a predominantly African-American community that's been stable ever since it was constructed. Meet some residents of Pontchartrain Park . CNN: The government's not rebuilding New Orleans. Do you think grass-roots groups will bring New Orleans back? PIERCE: While the government does not have a plan, it is the citizens who came to government and worked with them to lead them to reconstituting the neighborhoods. The Lower 9th and St. Bernard neighborhoods were harder hit; they have further to go. This is happening all over the city. That's the saddest part. What surprised me the most [when I began this] was the lack of skill and competence on the government's part to know how to put this together, and how strong the effort to stop people from moving back to New Orleans is. CNN: What do you mean when you talk about ""onesies and twosies""? PIERCE: It's no good to build one or two houses in a city that has 50,000 blighted properties. Like, this church group says ""We're doing three houses right here,"" a business group says it's doing two houses there, then ""I'm a contractor; I've got three houses over here."" We need large-scale development. My  group is not put together to do a hundred houses. Our goal is 7,000 in the city, about 550 in the Park. CNN: Did the HBO show ""Treme"" capture the real New Orleans? PIERCE: Well -- you can't tell all the stories; there are so many, so you can't please everybody -- but there is an authenticity to our show. It's true and real. Of all the shows about the city, this comes the closest to being authentic. CNN: You play a jazz musician in ""Treme"" and do lots of numbers. Do you really play the trombone? PIERCE: Yes, I do play the trombone, but I play very poorly, so they turn my mic off, and my sound double plays.

"Americans love beef; we eat nearly 63 pounds per person each year. Although that's a lot, the amount is down from our 1976 high of 89 pounds. When buying beef, we tend to stick to what we know, which may be why almost 60 percent of our beef dollars go for ground beef. Even as an experienced chef, I often brought home familiar cuts. But researching my book, ""Field Guide to Meat,"" led me to expand my repertoire to tasty, if less familiar, cuts like hanger steak and tri-tip. Soon you can do the same, knowing which cuts to choose for maximum flavor and nutrition. A 3½-ounce serving provides 27g to 30g of protein and is an excellent source of iron, zinc, and phosphorus. Beef Background . Humans began domesticating cattle, Bos taurus, about 8,500 years ago. Columbus first brought cattle to the New World, and by 1690, descendants of Columbus' cattle ranging in Mexico were driven north and became known as Texas Longhorns. Others arrived later with the colonists. America's top five cattle breeds are Angus from Scotland, Hereford from England, Limousin from France, Simmenthal from Switzerland, and Charolais from France. More than 90 percent of the beef we buy originates in America, while most of the rest is Canadian bred. The beef we eat comes mostly from 18- to 24-month-old steers, averaging about 1,000 pounds, and yielding about 450 pounds of meat. Each is divided for wholesale into eight primals (major portions): the chuck (shoulder and upper ribs), the rib, the loin, the sirloin (hip), the round (upper leg), the brisket (breast), the plate (belly), and the small flank. Organs like liver and kidneys are called variety meats. When evaluating your choices at the grocery store, here are a few key terms and facts to know: . • Grain-finished: Nearly 75 percent of U.S. beef comes from cattle fattened on grain (usually corn) for three to six months in feedlots. Since corn is not a natural part of a cow's diet, cattle fed on it may experience stress and other ailments, so they are routinely treated with antibiotics. They also receive growth hormones to increase their size (and value, as beef is sold by weight). Until recently, inexpensive corn has helped keep down the price of beef. • Grass-finished: Grass- or pasture-finished beef comes from cattle that forage on grasses and legumes. Their meat is lower in saturated fat, cholesterol, and calories than grain-finished. (Because it is quite lean, cook rare to medium-rare for juiciness.) Grass-fed beef has a distinct flavor, often described as bold, complex, and gamy. Many people believe that grass-fed cattle are a more sustainable choice. However, raising grass-fed cattle is time-consuming and requires large open spaces, variables that raise its price. Most is imported from Canada, followed by Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and Brazil. • Aging: Dry-aging is the traditional process preferred by many steak lovers. The concentrated, intense flavor of dry-aged beef develops as it hangs in special temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms from 10 days to six weeks. The longer the aging, the better the flavor and tenderness, but also the more the shrinkage as water evaporates and a dark crust develops, which must be cut away. About 90 percent of American beef is sold as large vacuum-packed cuts. During the average seven-day period the beef spends ""in the bag,"" it ages in a process called ""wet-aging."" • Processing and packaging: Until the 1960s butcher shops bought beef as half- or quarter-carcasses. Packers then began selling vacuum-packed beef, the same large cuts sold at warehouse club stores. Retailers refrigerated the boxes until needed, then opened the package and cut the meat into portions for sale. Next came case-ready meat, which precluded the need for skilled butchers on-site in markets. Leak-proof and easily stackable, case-ready packages are produced in USDA-inspected plants and have a longer shelf life. Packages covered with a sealed layer of clear plastic are modified-atmosphere packages, which have a gas-filled space inside to help preserve freshness and color. Nutrition . • Fat content: The USDA defines ""lean beef"" as having less than 10 grams (g) of total fat, 4.5g or less of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 3½-ounce serving (100g) of cooked beef. Half of the fat is saturated and half is heart-healthy monounsaturated. There are 29 naturally lean cuts of beef, including many familiar to Cooking Light readers, such as tenderloin, flank steak, and sirloin, as well as five lesser-known cuts. Others, such as ribeye or chuck roast, naturally contain more fat, although it is similarly divided between saturated and monounsaturated. Because lean beef contains less fat, it's best cooked to medium-rare (145°F) or medium (160°F) to optimize tenderness. If using fattier cuts, slice away the outer rim of fat and cut or pull out any pockets of fat before cooking. For larger cuts, allow the fat to baste the meat while cooking, then trim away before eating, or skim it from the surface of braised dishes or stews. • Other nutrients: A 3½-ounce serving provides 27g to 30g of protein -- more than half of the 50g recommended daily in a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet. All beef is an excellent source of iron, zinc, and phosphorus. In general, the redder the meat, the more iron it contains (beef liver has the most). Beef also contains thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin and is a rich source of B12, found naturally only in animal foods. CookingLight.com: Fat and Ground Beef . At the Market . • Inspection and grading: USDA inspectors examine all live animals and beef shipped out of state, which encompasses most of today's supermarket beef. Grading is voluntary and done by the same inspectors. The more marbling -- the small white flecks of fat within the muscles -- the higher the grade. Three grades of beef are sold to consumers. Only three percent is highly marbled Prime, sought after by top steak houses and butcher shops. About 57 percent is moderately marbled Choice, the most common supermarket grade. The remaining 40 percent is lean Select. • Private labels: Supermarket chains and large food distributors also have developed private brands with their own specifications. The first such program began in 1978 with Certified Angus Beef, which must come from Angus cattle. Niman Ranch Natural Beef and Certified Hereford Beef are two others. • Natural and Organic: Beef labeled ""natural"" must not contain any artificial ingredients and cannot be more than minimally processed, such as ground beef. ""Organic"" beef must come from cattle raised and certified according to the USDA's National Organic Program. Organic cattle must be fed 100-percent organically and without antibiotics or hormones. Both natural and organic beef can be either grass- or grain-finished. Ways to Save . • Buy lean cuts. Often, leaner cuts are cheaper than fatty ones. And when the fat cooks away, lean cuts provide more meat for your dollar. • Buy in bulk. Large or family-sized packages cost less per pound than smaller packages. Divide into portions, and freeze the surplus. • Be your own butcher. Beef that has been presliced into steaks or made into patties costs more than less processed meat. Buy bigger cuts, and do some of the preparation work yourself. CookingLight.com: Beef on a Budget . • But don't go overboard. Advice to buy a side or quarter of beef may seem sensible, but you'll likely have more meat than you can store. Such a purchase may yield what one buyer describes as ""cheap steak and expensive hamburger."" For more tips on making healthy taste great, try Cooking Light - CLICK HERE .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Natalie Cole's search for a new kidney ended this week when someone with a compatible organ died and their family asked that it be given to the singer, according to the organ procurement group that handled the donation. Natalie Cole received a kidney transplant Tuesday in Los Angeles. Cole, who underwent a successful kidney transplant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Tuesday, was ""responding well and recuperating"" Thursday, her publicist said. Cole had been on what she called ""a very long list"" of people waiting for an organ donation when she got word recently that OneLegacy, an organ procurement agency in Southern California, had a kidney that was a biological match. It was a ""directed donation"" from a deceased organ donor, according to OneLegacy CEO Tom Mone. ""Having heard of Ms. Cole's need for a kidney, the family asked that one of their loved one's kidneys be transplanted to Ms. Cole if they were a match,"" Mone said. Directed organ donations are rare, and rarer still are those directed to someone not related to or known personally by the deceased, he said. The donor will remain anonymous until the family gives permission for the name to be made public, he said. Cole's need for a kidney donation was highly publicized, including with an appearance on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on March 31. ""I'm on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors,"" said Cole, the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole. Cole said her kidney troubles date to February 2008 when she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. Cole said she attributes the Hepatitis C to her well-publicized struggles to stop using cocaine and heroin. Cole said she has been sober for some time now after two stints in a rehabilitation clinic. Cole said she underwent chemotherapy in an aggressive way to fight the virus. Within four months of getting chemotherapy, both of Cole's kidneys failed. ""I couldn't breathe. I -- I went into -- literally, my kidneys stopped functioning. They stopped, you know, processing the fluid that was starting to build up in my body."" Since then Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney, she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue. Cole won six Grammys for her 1991 critically acclaimed album ""Unforgettable: With Love,"" a jazzy tribute to her father. She won a Grammy this year for her new album ""Still Unforgettable"" and another Grammy for her work on another album. Cole was still able to tour this year even with her kidney ailment. She canceled a planned show last week in South Korea because of her illness, which meant she was in Los Angeles when the organ became available. ""I have been on dialysis in Istanbul, Milan, Indonesia, Manila, London. It's -- it's amazing,"" Cole said. During King's show, dozens of people sent e-mails to CNN telling Cole that they would get tested to see if their kidney could be donated. King handed a thick stack of paper to Cole. ""These are all e-mails from dozens -- dozens of people offering to be tested to see if they can match, who want to give you a kidney,"" King said. Cole stared at the papers for a moment. ""There are some great human beings out there. That's all I can say,"" Cole said. Cole is expected to return to the tour after three to four months of recovery. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Natalie Cole's new kidney came from deceased fan; fan's family asked for Cole .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- No deal has been reached between Michael Jackson's mother and his ex-wife over the custody of the late singer's children, according to a lawyer in the case. Debbie Rowe is the biological mother of Paris (left) and Prince Michael Jackson. Eric George, who represents Debbie Rowe, the biological mother of Jackson's two oldest children, demanded Tuesday that the New York Post retract its report that Rowe had agreed to take $4 million not to challenge Katherine Jackson for custody. In a letter sent Tuesday afternoon to the newspaper's editor, George said the report ""can only have been concocted with reckless disregard for the truth."" ""There has been no agreement reached between Ms. Rowe and the Jacksons,"" George said. ""The Post stands by its story,"" New York Post Editor-in-Chief Col Allan told CNN. While George said Rowe still has not decided if she will ask the court for custody or visitation, he said she will not try to get money from the Jackson family. ""Ms. Rowe has not accepted -- and will not accept -- any additional financial consideration beyond the spousal support she and Michael Jackson personally agreed to several years ago,"" George said. The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got a $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents. Jackson later agreed to additional support. Jackson's lawyer has not responded to requests for comment Tuesday. The Jackson family lawyer said last week that they were working to ""privately and amicably resolve"" the matter. A child custody court hearing, which had been set for this week, was delayed until next Monday at the request of lawyers for Jackson and Rowe, a court official said. Katherine Jackson gained temporary guardianship of the children soon after her son's death last month. The New York Post, quoting an unidentified Jackson family source, reported Rowe had agreed to drop any custody challenge for a $4 million payment.  Watch a discussion of the legal issues of the case » . ""Among the several contenders for overzealous and inaccurate sensationalism, the New York Post has now seized top honors,"" George wrote to the paper. ""It would be easier to identify those few background facts that are accurate than to catalog the number of blatant falsehoods in your story."" Jackson and Rowe married in 1996 and their first child -- Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. -- was born in February 1997. A daughter -- Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson -- was born the next year. The two met when Rowe was working as a nursing assistant in the Beverly Hills office of Jackson's dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein. Rowe said in a 2003 interview, later obtained by ABC News, that she became close to Jackson in 1996 when she consoled him after his brief marriage to Lisa Marie Presley ended. ""He was upset because he really wanted to be a dad,"" Rowe said. ""I said, 'So, be a dad.' He looked at me puzzled. That is when I looked at him and said. 'Let me do this. I want to do this. You have been so good to me. You are such a great friend. Please let me do this. You need to be a dad, and I want you to be.' "" She told the interviewer they married only to ""prevent some of the taboo of a child out of wedlock."" She gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children. A California appeals court later ruled her rights were improperly terminated, opening the door to a possible custody battle. Rowe claimed in the 2003 interview that she still had ""some influence"" over how Jackson raised the children, citing his practice of covering their faces in public as her idea. ""That was my request, not his,"" she said. ""I am the one who's terrified. I am the one who's seen the notes that someone's going to take his children,"" she said. She said the children don't call her ""mom"" because she did not want them to. ""It's not that they're not my children, but I had them because I wanted him to be a father,"" she said. Rowe, 50, lives on a horse farm in Palmdale, California, about 60 miles north of Los Angeles.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It was the stench. That was what really hit Danny Boyle the first time he went into a slum in India. In ""Slumdog"" a poor man wins a place on India's version of ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" ""There's this smell you get first of all,"" recalls the British director. ""This incredible mixture of our excrement -- it belongs to all of us -- and then saffron. It's just this mixture of sweet and sour."" Boyle's experiences shooting in the teeming, chaotic port city of Mumbai could also be described as sweet and sour. The director, who is renown for films like ""Trainspotting"" and ""28 Days Later,"" had never even been to India before he and his crew traveled there to make the critically acclaimed Oscar contender ""Slumdog Millionaire."" ""It's pretty mad,"" admits Boyle. ""Everything is extreme. It's too hot, the tea is too sweet; everything is kind of too much."" But, he adds: ""That's wonderful for drama, absolutely wonderful."" He and his crew threw themselves into shooting their drama in the streets and landmarks of India's ""city of dreams"" using passers-by as extras. They also shot in the Dharavi -- Asia's largest slum -- and Juhu slum which can be seen from the city's airport. ""Slumdog"" is a classic rags-to-riches story about a young boy from the slums, Jamal Malik (played by British actor Dev Patel), who beats millions of other Indians to bag a coveted place on the country's version of TV game show ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Through the timely story of the young ""slumdog,"" Boyle illuminates the contradictions of present day India -- the nuclear power that does not provide public sanitation for its population -- and Mumbai was the ideal city in which to do it. ""Mumbai is a city of extremes,"" Boyle explains, ""Life is raw. It's incredibly powerful and rich because their economy is expanding, the richest men in the world are there ... but then there is also this enormous poverty as well."" Do you think Danny Boyle has captured India in ""Slumdog Millionaire""? Tell us below in the SoundOff box. Boyle's film shows these extremes with great realism. He takes the audience from the cheerfully money-grubbing micro-commerce of the slums where young boys charge slum dwellers to use filthy latrines, to Jamal's job as a ""chaiwallah"" (tea boy) in one of India's much-publicized call centers, and later, to the Indian game show phenomenon, ""Kaun Banega Crorepati."" Boyle achieved this realism by immersing himself, his crew and actors in the Mumbai sprawl, and shooting as much as possible in real locations. ""I wanted to feel really involved in the city. I didn't want to be looking at it, examining it. I wanted to be thrown into the chaos as much as possible. ""There's a period of time between about 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. where it all stops and just the dogs move around, but other than that, the place is just a tide of humanity."" With limited time in India, Boyle made the decision to travel to the places he intended to shoot and film the cast's rehearsals there. This was something the film's star, Patel, found challenging at first. ""It's daunting at first doing these scenes outdoors with loads of people watching, but they just warm to it and everybody is, like, laughing and they start clapping at the end of the scenes,"" Patel laughs. His co-star Frieda Pinto, who plays love interest Latika, was born and brought up in Mumbai and knows the city well. Watch Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto talking about the making of ""Slumdog Millionaire."" ""You can't stop the bystanders in Bombay,"" she explains, ""It is something that you attract anyway, especially if you have a camera out there and a foreign crew and a song and dance. ""You are definitely going to attract a huge crowd and you can't do anything about it. The only thing you can do is enjoy it."" For Boyle and the crew, on the other side of the camera, the energy and chaos was a pretty intense experience. ""You just don't have any control in India,"" he explains. ""If you seek it, it will drive you insane. You've got to go with it really and just see what happens."" But they did have some tricks up their collective sleeve. Boyle and veteran cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle shot crowd scenes, like the chase through Juhu slum at the beginning of the film, using the people who happened to be passing by on the street for added realism. They wanted to draw as little attention to themselves as possible to keep the crowds looking natural. To achieve this feeling of being right in the middle of everything without disturbing the local communities too much, they used a variety of small digital cameras and digital stills camera. ""[We used] a Canon stills camera, which takes 12 frames per second. If people see a stills camera, they don't think it's recording live action,"" he explains. For Boyle, who believes his first film, ""Shallow Grave"" (1995) is still his best, because ""you haven't a clue what you are doing"" and ""you haven't learnt the tricks yet,"" he says, shooting in Mumbai was a way of recapturing that early originality. ""You arrive and you feel a bit vulnerable and naked again, and that's a really good thing, because you are not tempted to just step in your own footsteps all the time.""","Danny Boyle had never been to India before shooting ""Slumdog Millionaire""

"Moscow, Russia (CNN)  -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin sent a strong signal Thursday that he has full hands-on control of his country. As part of his annual town hall forum, Putin spoke for four hours and fielded 80 questions out of 2 million-plus submitted on a live call-in program, ""Conversation With Vladimir Putin -- Continued."" Responding to a question on whether he had any plans to retire and enjoy the life of an ordinary citizen, Putin tersely replied, ""Don't count on that."" And when asked whether he plans to run for the presidency again in 2012, he said, ""I will think about it. There is plenty of time for that."" Speaking of his ""tandem"" with President Dmitry Medvedev, Putin said he had ""known him for many years, graduated from the same universities, having been taught by the same professors."" ""Those common principles allow us to effectively work together,"" he said, responding to the never-ending speculation about which one of the duo is more important and whether a rift between them is possible. Putin juggled a myriad of facts and statistics, giving instructions to subordinates along the way to fix problems, as he responded to questions mostly on Russia's domestic issues. These covered pensions, medication prices, the overhauling of entire industries and Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization, Amur tigers and hip-hop music, and everything in between. The program was broadcast live on government television and radio. It marked Putin's eighth annual year-end ""town meeting,"" first launched in 2001 when he was president. This year's forum was his second as prime minister. Representatives from all Russian industries as well as university students packed the auditorium in Gostiny Dvor, a large conference hall next door to the Kremlin, where Putin appeared. Putin took questions from the hall's floor, with live cameras positioned in towns and cities across Russia, and he also responded to phone calls, e-mails and mobile SMS messages. He started off by addressing the issue of terrorism, coming nearly a week after the derailment of a luxury Moscow-St.Petersburg express train, which left 26 people dead and more than 100 injured. Russia's Federal Security Service said an improvised explosive device, which unknown bombers placed beneath the railroad bed, caused Friday's derailment. It was the biggest terror act outside Russia's troubled North Caucasus region since 2004. ""We did a lot [in recent years] to break the backbone of terrorism, but the threat has not been eliminated yet,"" Putin said. ""The entire society, each of us, should be conscious of this threat and be vigilant."" Addressing the economy, Putin said the peak of the global economic crisis has passed, ""although turbulent trends in the global and, as a result, the Russian economy, are still in place."" ""It will take time and effort to overcome the crisis,"" he said. The past year has been ""one of the most difficult"" for Russia in this decade, Putin added, saying the 2009 gross domestic product will shrink by 8.5 percent to 8.7 percent. The slump in the country's industry will be even bigger, he said, around 13 percent, but the projected inflation for 2009 will be lower than in the past year, about 9 percent. The prime minister also cited what he called ""positive developments"" in the Russian economy. He said some industries, such as military hardware production and agriculture, are even growing. In the arena of international politics, Putin told a questioner that he and former President George W. Bush had a good relationship but have not been in touch. The prime minister described Bush as a ""very honest and nice person,"" saying that if the ex-U.S. leader wanted to continue their relationship, he would be glad to do so. Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the wide range of issues on which Russians posed questions ""provides an excellent instrument for sociological study, and all questions that are being raised, are carefully studied. That [call-in show] gives a very reliable sociological survey."" Putin's popularity ratings at home demonstrates his political dominance in Russia. Confidence in the prime minister stood at 70 percent, as opposed to 59 percent for Medvedev, according to a recently published opinion poll conducted by Russia's Public Opinion Foundation. While Putin had his town hall forum, Medvedev was holding meetings in Italy with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Pope Benedict XVI.","Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin dismisses notion of retiring at town hall forum .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Katherine Jackson's legal battle for some control of her son's estate returns to court Monday in front of the same judge who is expected to award her permanent guardianship of Michael Jackson's children. Katherine Jackson has accused the executors of her son's estate of ""keeping her in the dark."" Dozens of lawyers are expected to pack a Los Angeles courtroom where a judge will consider the Jackson family matriarch's challenge of the lawyer and former music executive who were named as executors in Michael Jackson's will. Katherine Jackson's lawyers filed a petition last week accusing the men who now control the estate of being ""intent on keeping her in the dark"" about deals they've made or are negotiating. Londell McMillan, Jackson's lead attorney, raised questions about ""a suspicious circle of relationships"" involving John Branca, the singer's longtime personal attorney, and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime friend. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff gave Branca and McClain temporary control of the estate until Monday's hearing. Katherine Jackson is asking the judge to order Branca, McClain and others to answer questions under oath about their business agreements to determine if they are ""fit and able"" to administer the estate. The men also were served with a 19-page demand for documents. Branca has refused to let Katherine Jackson see Michael Jackson's contracts with AEG -- the company that was organizing and promoting his planned concerts -- unless she agrees to keep them confidential. Branca's lawyer argued in a court filing that he has no choice, since the contracts have a provision requiring confidentiality. Branca's lawyers also argued that Jackson's demand for documents was too broad and burdensome. ""Such measures will not be necessary if Mrs. Jackson is appointed a co-executor of the estate,"" McMillan said. McMillan, in an interview with CBS Thursday, estimated the Jackson estate was worth $2 billion, while the executors have estimated in court that its value is around $500 million. The will written in 2002 places all of Michael Jackson's assets into a family trust benefiting his mother, his three children and unnamed charities. Judge Beckloff will consider at Monday's hearing who will have permanent control of the estate. The judge is also expected Monday to finalize Katherine Jackson's guardianship of her son's three children. An agreement between Jackson and Debbie Rowe, the mother of the two oldest children, cleared the way for an uncontested custody hearing. Rowe, who was briefly married to Michael Jackson, agreed not to fight for custody in exchange for visits with the children as recommended by a psychologist. The agreement does not involve any financial payments to Rowe ""apart from the continuation of spousal support payments"" that Michael Jackson personally agreed to make to Rowe after their divorce, their lawyers said in a joint statement. Jackson's children have been living with their paternal grandmother at her Encino, California, home since their father's death. The oldest child -- Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. -- was born in February 1997. A daughter -- Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson -- was born the next year. Details of how the children were conceived -- and who was the biological father -- have been closely guarded amid much public speculation. The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got an $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents. Jackson later agreed to additional support. Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children. A California appeals court later ruled her rights were improperly terminated, opening the door to a possible custody battle. While the coroner's report on what killed Michael Jackson has been delayed indefinitely, new evidence emerged that the singer shopped for a doctor who would give him the drug investigators suspect led to his death. Dr. Allan Metzger, whose name appeared on a search warrant served this week, refused Jackson's request in April for the anesthetic propofol -- commonly known by the brand name Diprivan -- Metzger's attorney said. Investigators suspect another physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, gave the drug to Jackson in the 24 hours before he died, according to a source, who asked not to be named because the individual was not authorized to speak to the news media. Metzger, who practices in West Hollywood, California, told Jackson during a visit to his Holmby Hills home that the drug was ""dangerous and potentially life-threatening and could not be used outside of a hospital,"" attorney Harland Braun said. Metzger's medical records for Jackson, whom he treated until 2003, have been given to the coroner, Braun said. He said Metzger prescribed drugs for Jackson under the alias Omar Arnold and Michael Jackson, which was not illegal since he used both names together. The doctor did that because he thought it was ""his duty to protect the privacy"" of his patient, Braun said. Omar Arnold is one of 19 aliases listed in the warrant used by Los Angeles police and federal drug agents Tuesday to search the Las Vegas office and home of Murray, a Texas-based cardiologist. The warrant also mentioned Cherilyn Lee, a nurse practitioner who treated Jackson earlier this year. Lee told CNN Jackson begged her for the propofol to help him get a good night's sleep. She said she refused, telling the pop star that if he took the medicine, he might never wake up. The same warrant, signed by a Las Vegas judge, implied that investigators suspected Jackson was a drug addict. Dr. Deepak Chopra told CNN in a recent interview that when Jackson asked him for a narcotic, he told him absolutely no. ""I said to him, 'Michael, you're going to die one day from this,'"" Chopra said. During a world tour in the mid-'90s, sources close to Jackson told CNN, the pop star suffered from insomnia and traveled with an anesthesiologist who would ""take him down"" at night and then ""bring him back up."" According to a report on a 2004 Santa Barbara police investigation, security guards in Jackson's inner circle said he traveled the country getting prescriptions from doctors. The Los Angeles County coroner, who must rule on the cause of Jackson's June 25 death, met Thursday with the Los Angeles District Attorney, who must decide if anyone will be prosecuted for his death. During the meeting, it was decided that an announcement of the coroner's findings would be delayed indefinitely, according to a source close to the investigation. An official in the coroner's office had previously indicated to reporters that the findings would be made public within days. CNN's Randi Kaye contributed to this report.","Katherine Jackson looking for some control of her son's estate.

"(CNN) -- Ever since Robin Williams' turn as the Genie in ""Aladdin,"" voice artists who specialize in character work for animated movies have been sidelined by celebrities, no doubt tickled to do something they can show to their children. Jack Black tackles the voice of an energetic panda in the animated feature ""Kung Fu Panda."" DreamWorks Animation especially has invested in star power -- though the studio's rationale must be to flatter an older, media-savvy audience. (After all, it's the place that teamed Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese in ""Shark Tale"" and loaded the ""Shrek"" franchise with the dulcet tones of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas.) Too often though, DreamWorks movies coast on lazy pop cultural references in place of the deeper story and character development found in Pixar productions. ""Kung Fu Panda"" goes a step further. It's essentially an old-fashioned star vehicle, a virtual Jack Black movie that saves us the dubious pleasure of watching the real Jack Black doing the splits. (If you doubt that he could, check out the gravity-defying stunts an effects-enhanced Adam Sandler is capable of in ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan."" Or, on second thought, just take my word for it.) Black is Po, a tubby panda who dreams of kung fu ""awesomeness"" but whose career prospects boil down to inheriting his father's noodle stand. That is, until doddery turtle Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) baffles everyone by anointing Po the ""Dragon Warrior,"" a champion who will defend the valley from the wrath of mighty snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane). This inexplicable appointment not only threatens the safety of the entire community, it infuriates Oogway's small ratlike lieutenant, Shifu (a petulant Dustin Hoffman), who has dedicated himself to grooming a group called the Furious Five for just this task: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross). iReport.com: Share your review of ""Kung Fu Panda"" How can a chubby novice such as Po compete with these fierce warriors, let alone his former protégé, Tai Lung? Shifu puts Po through the wringer in the hope that he'll see sense and quit, but along with his prodigious appetite for chop suey, it turns out the panda is also quite the glutton for punishment. In other words, this is a fortune cookie variation that heroic slacker Black has played many times before: Po may look out of shape, but what he lacks in strength, discipline and intelligence, he more than makes up for in gut(s). You don't mess with the Po, man. The action tends to blur into a whirlwind of slapstick chaos. Choreography of kung fu between a snake or a mantis and a leopard may be too anatomically mindboggling to animate in greater detail. Bruce Lee was fast, but at least he had hands. The highlight is Po's breakthrough training bout with Shifu, a brilliantly inventive comic tour de force built around a solitary dumpling. Directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson, the film is brisk and businesslike, with an appropriately ersatz Chinatown look, but it doesn't betray any personality beyond Black's. Not that he isn't engaging, but it seems a waste of resources that Chan, Rogen, Liu and Jolie share about a dozen lines between them. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is fun as far as it goes, but unless you're 12, you'll  be hankering for something a bit more substantial half an hour after it's over. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is rated PG and runs 95 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's much more laudatory take, click here.","""Kung Fu Panda"" is a virtual Jack Black vehicle, says reviewer Tom Charity .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid and Barcelona remain on course to face each other in the final of the Spanish Cup after both claimed semifinal first leg victories on Wednesday. Karim Benzema scored the only goal of a tempestuous match to give Real Madrid a narrow 1-0 victory at holders Sevilla in the first leg of their semifinal. Meanwhile, a devastating first-half display set Barcelona on their way to a 5-0 home win over Almeria, leaving the second leg looking like a formality. Benzema, whose place in the Madrid side is under threat following the loan signing of Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor, settled the contest at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan stadium in the 15th minute, dribbling past one defender before cutting inside and curling home a left-foot shot. However, the home side were adamant they had levelled on the stroke of half-time when Luis Fabiano rounded goalkeeper Iker Casillas, only for Raul Albiol to clear the ball off the line. Sevilla players crowded the referee and his assistant claiming the ball had cross the line, but the officials waved away their protests and TV replays proved inconclusive. Both sides had chances to score after the break, notably Real when Mesut Ozil and Cristiano Ronaldo combined to somehow miss from close range. The match finished amid ugly scenes with Casillas holding his head after being struck from a missile thrown from the crowd. The result proved a timely present for Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho on his 48th birthday and also edged the club closer to the final of a competition they last won in 1993. Should Real avoid defeat in the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu, they will almost certainly face old rivals Barcelona for the first time in a final since 1990. Two goalkeeping errors handed Lionel Messi and David Villa early goals in the first half to give Barca a perfect start and some more Messi magic made it 3-0 by just the 16th minute. Pedro headed home a Xavi free-kick in the 31st-minute for their fourth goal and a flowing move resulted in Seydou Keita adding a fifth with just two minutes remaining. Elsewhere, Serie A leaders AC Milan are through to the semifinals of the Italian Cup after a 2-1 victory at Sampdoria. Two goals from Brazilian Alexandre Pato earned victory for the visitors, and ensured Milan striker Antonio Cassano made a winning return to Genoa, less than a month after being effectively sacked by Sampdoria after falling out with the club's president. Pato struck twice in the space of five first-half minutes, both times being set-up by new Dutch signing Urby Emanuelson. The home side pulled a goal back early in the second half when Massimo Maccarone netted on his debut following his move from Palermo, but Milan held on to reach the last four of the competition. Milan were joined in the last four by holders and city rivals Inter Milan, who beat Napoli 5-4 on penalties, after 90 minutes and extra time went by without either side scoring a goal. Palermo secured their place in the last four on Tuesday, also going through on penalties against Parma, while Juventus and Roma will face each other on Thursday for the final remaining place. The semifinal line-up for the German Cup has also now been decided following Wednesday's remaining last eight matches. Thomas Mueller scored twice as holders Bayern Munich cruised to a 4-0 victory at second division side Alemannia Aachen. However, there were shocks in the two other matches on Wednesday with second division Energie Cottbus and Duisburg putting out Bundesliga sides Hoffenheim and Kaiserslautern. Schalke sealed their place in the semifinals with a 3-2 extra time victory over Nuremberg on Tuesday.","Real Madrid win 1-0 at holders Sevilla in their Spanish Cup semifinal first leg .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Hundreds of hawkers and beggars, quite often seen on Dhaka's major roads and at traffic stops, will be driven out next month ahead of the Cricket World Cup scheduled to begin in mid February, officials said Wednesday. Three South Asian nations ннн-- Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka -- are jointly hosting the grand gala ICC World Cup 2011 and the opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka on February 17. ""No hawkers will be allowed in the streets and beggars will be evicted temporarily from many parts of the city,"" said Bangladesh Home Minister Shara Khatun. In Bangladesh, matches will be played in the capital of Dhaka and the southeast port city of Chittagong. Apart from six group matches, two quarterfinals will take place in Bangladesh, officials said. Sahara Khatun, junior minister for home affairs, and other top government officials Tuesday had a meeting to ensure fail safe security for the more than a month-long cricket event. The government is also working to give Dhaka a facelift ahead of the tournament, which will be played by 14 countries in two groups. The countries are Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, England, India, Ireland, Kenya, Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, West Indies and Zimbabwe. Officials said the beggars would be taken to government asylums for the time being from the first week of February. ""I'm really upset. I don't know what I'll do for the living of my family in February and March,"" Mohammad Suman, who sells pirated copies of foreign books at one of the busiest traffic signals near the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka's Karwan Bazar, told CNN on Wednesday. The minister said that they would also recommend making February 17 a public holiday in Dhaka. As a part of heightening security, the army would be deployed in many places, besides police and elite forces of the Rapid Action Battalion, officials said. The Bangladesh government imposed a ban on begging amid criticism two years ago, saying they would stop the practice within five years. According to the law, anyone caught begging in public places faces a maximum three months in jail. But begging is still seen in almost everywhere in Dhaka нн-- a city of ten million people, one third of whom are extremely poor and live in shanties. According to the World Bank and the United Nations, 40 percent of Bangladesh's 140 million people live below the poverty level.","Bangladesh is one of three countries hosting the Cricket World Cup .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Political protests in Egypt, the aftermath of an attack, and a music megastar who's using his fame to raise awareness about a disease. All of it's coming up in this Wednesday edition of CNN Student News. Hello, everyone. I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: State of the Union . AZUZ: The place: Washington, D.C. The event: An annual address to the nation steeped in history, and the response to it. U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, both took to the airwaves last night. CNN Student News brings highlights tomorrow. If you wanna watch the complete speeches, CNNStudentNews.com! You'll find 'em in the ""In Depth"" box. Click on ""State of the Union."" Now, while we're on the subject of State of the Union, we are breaking down the history of the speech for you right now. First stop: U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 3. ""The president shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."" Now, that's what the Constitution requires; there are a lot of things that are traditions that are not required by the Constitution. For one, this address does not have to be annual, though a yearly speech dates back to George Washington. It doesn't need to be in person. In fact, our third president, Thomas Jefferson, had the speech delivered in writing to Congress. And the State of the Union doesn't need to be made at a congressional session of both Houses, though that's what we see every year, and what we saw last night. Here's why the State of the Union address is delivered in late January or early February: the 20th Amendment. It was ratified in 1933, and it specifies that congressional terms start on January third and presidential terms start on January 20th. So, it's when everyone is seated in office that the speech is given in late January or early February. A little history for ya: President Coolidge was the first president to broadcast the speech over the radio; that was back in 1923. His nickname was ""Silent Cal,"" but he wasn't silent then! President Truman was the first on TV with the speech in 1947. And this is around the time it started being called ""State of the Union"" instead of the president's annual message to Congress, as it was known before that. And in 2002, President George W. Bush became the first president to deliver the speech on the web. Congresswoman's Health . AZUZ: The members of Arizona's congressional delegation were all planning to sit together for last night's State of the Union address. But they were going to leave one chair empty in honor of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. She was one of the victims of a shooting we told you about earlier this month. She's recovering from her injuries, and she's getting a lot of support. CLASS, HOUSTON, TEXAS: Get well soon, Ms. Giffords! AZUZ: Those well wishes came from students in Houston, Texas. A lot of people in that community were sending their best wishes and signing ""get well soon"" cards for the Arizona representative. She was transferred to a hospital in Houston late last week. Doctors say that Giffords is doing well and showing lots of improvement, but that she has a long road ahead of her. I.D. Me . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm an African country that's home to more than 80 million people. My national currency is the pound. I border two seas, the Mediterranean and the Red. I'm Egypt, and my current president, Hosni Mubarak, has been in power since 1981. Protests in Egypt . AZUZ: After the nearly three decades he's spent in power, thousands of Egyptians are calling for President Mubarak to step down. In the U.S., presidents can only serve two terms. But in Egypt, there are no term limits. That's one reason why Mubarak has been president for so long. But protests in the African nation are taking aim at President Mubarak and his government. This YouTube video shows a crowd of protesters moving through the streets in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. The people who organized the protests said they're trying to catch some of the momentum for political change that they saw in the nearby country of Tunisia. That nation's longtime leader was recently removed from power. During yesterday's demonstrations in Egypt, protesters fought with police. Both sides were throwing rocks and tear-gas canisters at each other. Other countries, including the United States, said they were keeping a close eye on the situation. Moscow Airport Bombing . AZUZ: Russian President Dmitry Medvedev says that whoever is behind Monday's suicide bombing at Moscow's busiest airport will be found and will be punished. The attack killed dozens of people, injured more than 150 others. And sadly, this bombing isn't an isolated incident. Over the last decade, trains and planes around Moscow have been bombed at least four times. President Medvedev said that part of the blame for Monday's attack is on the people who were responsible for the airport's security. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT DMITRY MEDVEDEV [TRANSLATED]: What happened at Domodedovo shows that the airport lacked security. It's unbelievable that such a huge amount of explosives was brought into the terminal. Those officials responsible for security at Domodedovo must be punished for their decisions. This is a terror attack, a grief, a tragedy. START Treaty Ratified . AZUZ: President Obama called President Medvedev yesterday to offer his condolences about the bombing. During that same call, he congratulated the Russian president on the progress toward a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START. This would reduce the number of nuclear weapons in both the U.S. and Russia. Presidents Medvedev and Obama signed the treaty last April. Part of Russia's parliament approved that treaty yesterday. The U.S. Senate did the same thing last month. President Obama calls the START ""the most significant arms control agreement in nearly two decades."" Shoutout . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Sheets' American History classes at Glades Middle School in Miramar, Florida! What part of the human body produces insulin? You know what to do! Is it the: A) Liver, B) Kidneys, C) Pancreas or D) Lungs? You've got three seconds -- GO! Your pancreas makes insulin, which helps control your body's blood sugar. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Educating Through Music . AZUZ: When someone's body has problems controlling blood sugar, it could mean the person has diabetes. The American Diabetes Association estimates that more than 23 million Americans have some form of this disease. And that includes one member of the Jonas Brothers. Dr. Sanjay Gupta shows us how he's trying to help other people who are living with diabetes. (BEGIN VIDEO) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: The Jonas Brothers have been one of the most successful young acts for the past several years, having sold millions of records and entertaining audiences all over the globe. They just completed a world tour about a month ago, which took them from the United States to Argentina, Brazil, Europe and the United Arab Emirates. Now, shortly after the group signed their first recording contract, Nick, the youngest Jonas Brother, was diagnosed with Type I, or juvenile diabetes. NICK JONAS, JONAS BROTHERS: I was diagnosed in November of 2005. So, I was about 13. I lost 15 pounds in a total of about three weeks, which was a bit startling considering I only weighed about 105 pounds to start with. GUPTA: Nick was told his blood sugar was over 700. A normal level is below 125. JONAS: My commitment to myself when I was on my way to the hospital was that I would not let this slow me down. GUPTA: Nick has learned to live with his disease and hasn't let it get in the way of the Jonas Brothers' success. Two and a half years after his diagnosis, on a day when Nick says his blood sugar was a little out of control, he wrote a song about having diabetes. He says writing ""A Little Bit Longer"" was therapy for him, and fans have told him it's helped them cope as well. JONAS: I think just the fact that I can say, look, you're just like everybody else, you can do what you want to do, and you can do it with diabetes, that's the best thing in the world. GUPTA: Jonas says he is thankful to be able to do what he loves and uses his fame to educate people about the disease. With the Jonas Brothers Change for the Children Foundation, Nick has been raising awareness and funds for diabetes research for several years now. JONAS: What we can do financially is great and I'm always happy to do that, but if there is something that I can do personally to inspire or encourage somebody, that means the world. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, during a timeout at a women's college basketball game, one of the school's officials was randomly chosen from the audience to try a half-court shot. Mr. Showoff decides he's gonna do it backwards. There's no way this is going to work, right? Bam! Nails it! He won a set of brand new tires in the process. Now, we couldn't make sense of a pun about a backwards basket. Goodbye . AZUZ: I mean, we gave it a shot, but it just went over our heads. Gosh, we just never tire of this.

"(EW.com) -- Jason Statham is the B-movie bruiser of the moment. He appears in the occasional Guy Ritchie gangster head game, but his genre of choice is the revved-up testosterone action film. The key to his charisma is that he's so much more cutthroat smart and elegant, and so much more coolly British, than an actor from the crash-cars-and-ask-questions-later school needs to be. With his shaved skull and handsome you-talkin'-to-me stare, he's like a Bruce Willis mad-dog avenger crossed with a more sociopathic James Bond. As Arthur Bishop, the title character of ""The Mechanic,"" Statham is playing one of those super-stealth hitmen who can sneak into the most protected of lairs and slip away moments later with the target dead. The opening swimming-pool assassination is just clever enough to set you up for a hitman version of a heist thriller. But then Statham's lone wolf is tricked into killing his longtime corporate associate (Donald Sutherland). Feeling used, he tries to make up for his sin by taking Sutherland's son under his wing -- a dissipated rich boy played by Ben Foster, who suggests a gnarled, hillbilly Justin Timberlake. How do Statham and Foster team up in this movie? Simple: Statham, in about six minutes, teaches Foster everything there is to learn about being a master assassin. Before long, the apprentice is leaping off skyscrapers and wielding his weapon with fearless aplomb. The implausibility of ""The Mechanic,"" even on its own genre-movie terms, is jaw-dropping. Yet I might have forgiven that had the movie tried to involve us in some more elaborately sneaky contract murders. As it is, ""The Mechanic"" is ham-fisted pulp, like Robert Rodriguez's ""Machete"" taking itself seriously. It's enough to make you want to see Jason Statham take a break from B movies and become the A-list character actor he deserves to be. C . See full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- A key United Nations committee on Thursday condemned Myanmar's human rights record while the secretary-general of the world body stressed the need for democratic reform. In a call to freed pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon emphasized the importance of a peaceful democratic transition and reconciliation process in Myanmar. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient in 1991, has spent 15 of the past 21 years under house arrest for her opposition to authoritarian rule in the nation formerly known as Burma. She was released last week. ""The secretary-general told Aung San Suu Kyi that he was encouraged by the spirit of reconciliation emanating from her statements and appeals for dialogue and compromise following her release,"" the U.N. said in a statement. A U.N. General Assembly subset committee approved a draft resolution denouncing ""the ongoing systematic violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Myanmar."" The resolution also slammed the nation's recent elections and said they were not fair and inclusive. Susan Rice, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., welcomed the resolution and said it honored the commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. ""The government of Burma continues to commit serious human rights violations, including arbitrary and prolonged detentions of its citizens, rape and sexual violence, discrimination and violence against ethnic minorities, and impose serious restrictions on freedom of speech, press association and assembly,"" Rice said in a statement. Suu Kyi and Ban vowed to pressure the nation's military junta to release more than 2,100 political prisoners. ""They both stressed the need for the Myanmar authorities to release all remaining political prisoners so that all of the country's citizens are free to contribute to advancing the prospects of national reconciliation and democratic transition in Myanmar,"" the statement said.","General Assembly subset committee slams ""ongoing systematic violation of human rights""

"(CNN)  -- More than 14 months after they fled fighting between rebel and government forces, park rangers who monitor mountain gorillas in war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo have returned to the reserve. Young gorillas play in Congo's Virunga National Park in an undated photograph. It is a welcome sight at Virunga National Park, where around 200 of the world's 700 mountain gorillas live. Samantha Newport, communications director for the refuge, told CNN on Friday that 70 rangers have returned to the gorilla refuge. They left when the sector was taken over by Laurent Nkunda's Tutsi armed force, which is fighting Congolese soldiers and their militia allies. About 50 other rangers who fled after rebels seized the park headquarters last month also have come back, Newport said, and about 150 other rangers will be returning after being away for a month or two. Around 400 other rangers never left the nearly 8,000-square kilometer park, in which the gorilla reserve encompasses 250 square kilometers, Newport said. The gorilla section of the park lies in a strategically important area near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. Newport said Nkunda's rebels still control much of the park and the preserve, but efforts have been made by combatants to protect the gorilla refuge and not interfere with the park rangers' duties. In a news release, Virunga Park Director Emmanuel de Merode said, ""It is a huge step that all sides have agreed that the protection of Virunga as a World Heritage Site and its mountain gorillas is of sufficient priority to transcend political differences."" He added, ""Rangers are neutral in this conflict, and it is right that they should be allowed to do their job."" The rangers will be conducting a census of the gorillas. There were 72 habituated and around 120 non-habituated gorillas in the reserve in August 2007, when the last census was conducted. That number is expected to change because of births and deaths. Habituated describes those gorillas who are accustomed to contact with humans, and non-habituated refers to those who are not used to human presence, Newport explained. Virunga National Park is a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage Site and Africa's oldest national park. It was formerly known as Albert National Park.","Fighting forced rangers to flee gorilla reserve in Democratic Republic of Congo .

"(CNN) -- Police in Albuquerque, New Mexico, released a composite image Tuesday of a young boy found buried beneath the sand of a local playground. Police released this composite sketch of the boy in hopes that someone can identify him. The boy was discovered on Friday by a passerby who saw a tiny black and lime shoe protruding from beneath the playground sand. It led police to the body of a boy, who had been buried there in a shallow grave less than 48 hours earlier. On Tuesday, police still had no answers as to what happened at Alvarado Park -- or even who the boy was. His name is unknown, though the community has dubbed him ""Baby Justice"" or ""Baby Angel."" Nobody in the area has claimed his body, and nobody has reported a child of his age missing. Before the composite image was created, police weren't able to release a photo of the boy because his body was so disfigured by the sand's heat. Police say the Native American or Hispanic boy was between 3 and 5 years old, 38 pounds, 38 inches in height, with brown eyes and dark quarter-inch hair. When he was found, he was wearing Arizona brand clothing, size 3T -- nylon black running pants with red stripes, a red shirt with a monster truck on it and black, gray and lime green Skechers sneakers. Police aren't sure how he died. Albuquerque Police Department spokesman John Walsh said a preliminary autopsy didn't reveal a cause of death. Walsh said there were no obvious signs of bruising on the boy. ""We have canvassed the entire adjoining neighborhood,"" Walsh said. ""We're knocking on every door. We've been broadcasting and pleading for tips from the community. But still, nobody has come forward."" Though police have received numerous tips from the public, Walsh said nothing has come from them. Albuquerque police are working with other local, state and nationwide law enforcement officials to try to piece together what happened. Until then, members of the community have spent hours at memorials for the boy -- who none of them knew -- praying for him and raising money. French Mortuary, in the town, has offered to pay all funeral costs for the boy. Resident Rachel Lesperance told CNN affiliate KOAT-TV she spent her weekend collecting $3,600 for the boy. Her money, and the donations raised by others, will go toward a plaque at the park in the boy's honor, buying extra lights for the playground and to a fund toward finding out what happened to the little ""Baby Justice."" ""He doesn't have a family,"" Lesperance told KOAT-TV. ""We're his family now, and we want him to be taken care of like one of our own.""","Boy found Friday at Alvarado Park buried under sand in playground .

"(CNN) -- Al-Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Hajj arrived home in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum early Friday after nearly six years in the U.S. Navy prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Al-Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Hajj at a hospital in Khartoum after his release from Guantanamo Bay. ""I was so happy that I cried,"" al-Hajj told the Qatar-based Arabic news network by phone from his hospital room, where he was taken after arriving at the airport. ""It is our right to be happy and to rejoice, but we also miss our brothers that we left behind and who live in very difficult conditions."" An official with the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said the transfer brought to an end a matter that the United States and Sudan considered to be ""of great mutual concern."" Al-Hajj, a Sudanese citizen in his late 30s, was captured in Afghanistan in December 2001 by Pakistani intelligence officers and handed over to the United States, which accused him of being an ""enemy combatant."" A senior Pentagon official confirmed the journalist's release. Al-Hajj was held without being charged or given a trial, Al-Jazeera reported. The cameraman was on a legitimate assignment and carried a work visa at the time of his capture, the network said. It also reported that the U.S. plane that carried al-Hajj had about 20 other former detainees aboard who also had been released from Guantanamo Bay. The plane dropped off a Moroccan national, identified as Al-Saeed Bou Jaadiya, the network said. Al-Jazeera aired video showing a bearded al-Hajj being carried from the plane in Khartoum by U.S. military personnel and laid on a stretcher. He was transported to Al-Amal Hospital. ""He was brought in here by ambulance and entered to the intensive care unit on a stretcher,"" said Al-Jazeera Director General Wadah Khanfar from the hospital. ""He was exhausted and very sick, and he's receiving the necessary care in the hospital."" Khanfar said he was awaiting word from doctors on his medical condition. In a statement, U.S. Charge D'Affaires Alberto Fernandez of the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said the transfer ""is a result of many factors and the work of many hands. An important one was the cooperation between the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum and the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Intelligence and Security Service."" Al-Hajj had been on a hunger strike for more than a year and was being force-fed, said Zachary Katznelson, a lawyer who has worked on al-Hajj's case since August 2005 and last visited him three weeks ago.

The Sudanese government told Al-Jazeera that al-Hajj faced no charges in Sudan and is a free man. The network also said the United States placed some conditions on al-Hajj's release, including one that prevents him from any political activity. Reporters Without Borders, which campaigned for al-Hajj's release, said in a statement that the cameraman ""never should have been held so long."" ""U.S. authorities never proved that he had been involved in any kind of criminal activity,"" the worldwide press freedom group said. The organization said al-Hajj was accused of gun-smuggling for al Qaeda and running an Islamist Web site, although no evidence supporting those charges was produced. ""We are delighted that Sami al-Hajj can finally be reunited with his family and friends,"" said Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists.

"(CNN) -- The 103 Chadian children whom six French charity workers were convicted of attempting to kidnap will soon be reunited with their families, the United Nations' children agency said Friday. Some of the 103 children who were nearly abducted by a French charity, pictured in Abeche in November 2007. The children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche, in eastern Chad, since late October. Chadian authorities arrested the Zoe's Ark aid workers as they earlier tried to leave the central African country with the children on a Paris-bound plane, the United Nations Children's Fund said. The charity had said the children were orphans from Sudan's war-torn Darfur region and were being taken to foster families in France. However, other charities determined that most of the children were from Chad, not Sudan, and had at least one living parent. Beginning next week, a UNICEF team will travel to Abeche, Adre and Tine to facilitate reuniting the 21 girls and 82 boys, aged 1 to 10, with their families. Chad's government has approved the move, UNICEF said. Interviews with the children indicated that the majority were from villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the Chadian-Sudanese border, according to a November statement from the Red Cross, UNICEF, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The kidnapping scandal attracted international attention, with French authorities reacting angrily to the charity's trip, calling the group's actions ""illegal and irresponsible."" However, French President Nicolas Sarkozy intervened on the six's behalf after a Chadian court sentenced the six aid workers to eight years of hard labor in Chad, and the central African nation handed them over to France to serve their sentences. In late January, a French court sentenced Eric Breteau -- the group's leader -- Emilie Lelouch, Alain Peligat, Philippe van Winkelberg, Dominique Aubry and Nadia Merimi to eight years in a French prison.

"(CNN) -- English Premier League club Liverpool have rejected Chelsea's bid for Fernando Torres and insisted the Spain striker is not for sale. The Merseyside club confirmed on their website that a bid had been received -- reported in British newspaper the Daily Telegraph to be around $63 million -- but that it was dismissed out of hand. The 26-year-old striker, who was part of Spain's World Cup winning squad in South Africa, has scored nine goals this season, including two when the Reds beat reigning Premier League champions Chelsea back in November. He has found the net three times since club legend Kenny Dalglish took over the managerial reins from Roy Hodgson, and the Scot is said to be insistent that his prize asset is not allowed to leave. Liverpool agree fee with Ajax for Luis Suarez . A statement on the club's official website read: ""Liverpool Football Club have insisted Fernando Torres is not for sale despite the emergence of a bid from Chelsea. ""When presented with the story by the media on Thursday night, a LFC spokesman dismissed any notion that the Spain international was for sale. ""Chelsea have made a bid for Fernando which has been turned down,"" the spokesman said. ""The player is not for sale."" Chelsea have also failed in their bid to sign Brazilian defender David Luiz from Portuguese club Benfica. A statement on the Benfica website read: ""Negotiations between Benfica and Chelsea over the possible transfer of David Luiz reached a conclusion today without the parties having reached an agreement. ""Contrary to reports in recent days, David Luiz never tried to force his way out of the club and is a model professional."" The news comes just days after Spanish club Atletico Madrid reported they had turned down Chelsea's $82 million bid for Argentina striker Sergio Aguero and 24-year-old defender Diego Godin, from Uruguay. At a press conference on Friday, Chelsea's Italian manager Carlo Ancelotti refused to talk about transfers. He told reporters: ""I always speak just about my players and Torres is not my player. I have to respect Liverpool. It is the same with David Luiz. ""I know very well what my club is doing now but I don't want to speak about it.

"(CNN)  -- Should celebrity chefs stick to stand-and-stir shows? Self-proclaimed ""Kulinary Gangsta"" (no, seriously -- he has a tattoo and everything) and Food Network phenom Guy Fieri failed to catch fire with audiences in his prime-time major network debut. Variety reports that NBC's ""Minute to Win It"" -- a distinctly non-""kulinary""  game show that challenges competitors to master stunts like one-handed tissue-box emptying and re-stacking plastic cups -- ""didn't put up great overall numbers from 7 to 9 p.m."" on Sunday but rallied slightly against other networks' programming at the 8:30 p.m. mark. Lukewarm ratings might not relegate most shows to the trash bin, but given how this one underperformed after being so heavily promoted via pricey Winter Olympics commercial breaks, popular food blogs like ""Eater"" are already predicting the show's cancellation. But it's not just hard out there for a ""gangsta""; over the past decade, several notable chefs failed to bring the sizzle to the network spotlight. With NBC set to take another gamble on Chef Bobby Flay's upcoming reality show, ""America's Next Great Restaurant,"" network execs might wish to take a second look at a few star turns that flamed out fast. 'Kitchen Confidential' -- Anthony Bourdain . ""No Reservations"" host and leather-jacket aficionado Anthony Bourdain steamed up bookstore shelves nationwide with his restaurant tell-all ""Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly"" in 2000. FOX's sitcom incarnation, featuring a defanged ""Jack Bourdain,"" played by Bradley Cooper, replated the book's sex-drugs-and-rock-'n'-roll soul as a sanitized snack of wacky kitchen hijinks and one-note characters. After four episodes, the network put it in the deep freeze, airing the remaining nine episodes online and outside the U.S. 'Emeril' -- Emeril Lagasse . In 2001, New Orleans' Emeril Lagasse starred in a self-titled sitcom set behind the scenes at a fictional cooking show. Bereft of his essential ""BAM!"" and ""Kick it up a notch"" catchphrases and scripted as a watered-down version of his charismatic bayou-blasting Food Network persona, Lagasse and co-star Robert Urich muddled their way through 11 bland, critically panned episodes before NBC pulled the plug. 'The Restaurant' -- Rocco DiSpirito . Long before he danced with the stars and shilled for Bertolli, Rocco DiSpirito was an honest-to-goodness chef at an acclaimed Manhattan restaurant called Union Pacific. This rude, raw, reality show, however, was not set there. Rather, ""The Restaurant"" -- airing on NBC in 2003-04 -- documented DiSpirito's fraught relationship with restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow as they made nasty hash opening a joint venture called ""Rocco's."" The show, stuffed to the gills with product placements, featured frequent clashes between front- and back-of-house staffs, diners, servers (hired on-air from a pool of more than 2,000 fame-starved applicants), and DiSpirito and everyone but his sainted mother, who made the restaurant's signature meatballs. While ""The Restaurant"" made it to a very short second season, a painfully public legal conflict between DiSpirito and Chodorow shuttered the restaurant and the show. Rocco has never cooked in a restaurant again. 'The Chopping Block' -- Marco Pierre White . ""Hell's Kitchen (UK)"" host and British tabloid staple Marco Pierre White popped across the pond to helm this competitive restaurant reality show for NBC in the spring of 2009. Though mentorship of Gordon Ramsay and Mario Batali and a spicy biography entitled ""The Devil in the Kitchen"" established him as a culinary cult favorite, as the show's host and head judge, White swapped his legendary scorching temper (he once allegedly set a young chef on fire for complaining about the kitchen's temperature) for a tone so chill, it sent viewers nodding into their sorbet. After three episodes, NBC placed the show on a back burner, releasing the remainder of the episodes online.","Food Network phenom Guy Fieri failed to catch fire with audiences on NBC .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- International flights to the Indonesian island of Bali were canceled Friday because of volcanic ash, according to a transportation official. Mount Bromo in East Java has been erupting since late last year. Although the threat level was downgraded recently, it continues to spew out ash columns, according to the Indonesian Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation agency. East Java is in close proximity to Bali. A volcanic ash monitoring center in Darwin, in northern Australia, issued a Notice to Airmen warning that the ash could affect aviation. That prompted all international airlines to cancel flights. International flights of the airlines Cathay Pacific, Virgin Blue, Jetstar and Value were affected, said Bambang Ervan, spokesman of the Transportation Ministry. Domestic flights were not canceled, as the they may go through another air route that is deemed safer, officials said. ""Our team and also the (Bali's) Ngurah Rai Airport team is still monitoring the conditions at the airport,"" Ervan said.

"(CNN) -- FBI agents have executed 40 search warrants throughout the United States as part of an investigation into recent coordinated cyber attacks targeting major companies, the agency said. The United Kingdom's Metropolitan Police Service executed additional search warrants and arrested five people for their alleged role in the attacks, the FBI said in a statement Thursday. A group calling itself ""Anonymous"" has claimed responsibility for the attacks, the FBI said. The attacks were allegedly carried out by people who are active supporters of WikiLeaks, but are not affiliated with the website, a federal law enforcement source said. Late last year, the group launched take-down campaigns against organizations that have shunned the site WikiLeaks. Under the banner ""Operation Payback,"" the Anonymous group successfully crashed MasterCard.com and strained the websites of Visa and PayPal. Anonymous allegedly makes its attacks not through hacking, but merely by directing a giant traffic surge to the targeted website. That's called a DDoS attack, short for distributed denial-of-service -- and it's hard for most websites to defend against. ""The attacks were facilitated by software tools the group makes available for free download on the internet,"" the FBI said in a statement. Facilitating or conducting such attacks is illegal and punishable by up to 10 years in prison, the FBI said.

"(CNN) -- Aid is getting to Haiti but it's not as simple as getting a direct flight to the quake-battered nation. CNN followed one aid container from the headquarters of ShelterBox in Cornwall, England, to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to see the hurdles aid groups face. Minutes after the earthquake struck on January 12, the ShelterBox crew sprang into action. The international disaster relief organization is the brainchild of Tom Henderson, who was recognized as a CNN Hero in 2008. ""If you've lost everything as they have in Haiti, it's all about shelter, warmth, comfort and dignity,"" says Henderson. ""That's what ShelterBox is."" A ShelterBox container -- containing relief supplies including a 10-person tent, water and blankets -- is designed to be easily carried by two people and stackable for easy storage. To get to Haiti from Cornwall, the box went on four flights and one overland trip over five days before being distributed to a mother and her newborn baby. Once in the Dominican Republic -- Haiti's neighbor -- there were delays because of security concerns and a national holiday that meant local help was limited. The ShelterBox was one of 720 boxes eventually loaded into a four truck convoy in Santa Domingo for a U.N.-escorted drive to Haiti. The drive from Santo Domingo to the Haiti border took about 11 hours because of poor roads and a puncture. Twelve ShelterBoxes are being used to build an emergency field hospital at the airport, said Mark Pearson who is in Haiti for the charity. Each ShelterBox contains individual survival equipment like water carriers, a tool kit and a children's pack containing drawing books, crayons and pens. By February 1, Shelterbox hopes to have more than 7,000 boxes in Haiti, housing up to 70,000 people. But Henderson acknowledges there is much more to be done. ""There are thousands of people dying every day. That's what drives us forward. This is not a job for us. It's a passion."" Want to get involved?

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan would be funded into early 2009 under a compromise plan approved Thursday by the U.S. House. The bill includes $165 billion to fund the wars in Afghanistan, above, and Iraq. The $165 billion measure puts no restrictions on money the Bush administration had requested to continue bankrolling the wars but includes money for key domestic priorities for House Democrats, namely more unemployment assistance for people who lose their jobs and an expansion of the G.I. Bill. The plan also includes more than $2 billion for disaster assistance for areas in the Midwest dealing with massive flooding. A first vote, on the war funding, was approved 268-155. A second vote on the domestic money passed 416-12. President Bush and many congressional Republicans had resisted extending unemployment benefits, but the compromise bill includes another 13 weeks of assistance. Democrats had been pushing for extending benefits to laid-off workers as unemployment rates continue to rise. Democrats also got Republican support for a college scholarships program for U.S. troops, known as a ""new G.I. bill."" This program expands educational benefits for veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan to pay for full four-year scholarships. House Democratic and Republican leaders reached an agreement on the plan Wednesday, and Bush administration officials said they were satisfied with the compromise. Anti-war protesters in the House gallery shouted and chanted briefly during the vote, tossing what appeared to be slips of paper onto the House floor. They were removed from the gallery without incident. The two bills approved Thursday will be combined and sent to the Senate for approval as one measure.","$165 billion measure puts no restrictions on war-money Bush requested .

Liverpool reject Chelsea's bid for Fernando Torres . A statement on the official Ajax website read: ""Ajax and Liverpool have reached an agreement over the transfer of Luis Suarez. ""He will make the move to the English club immediately. The deal is worth up to a total of €26.5 million ($36 million).""

"(CNN) -- South African rugby union stars Chiliboy Ralepelle and Bjorn Basson are free to play again after their bans for testing positive for a prohibited stimulant were scrapped. The pair were charged after South Africa's test match against Ireland in Dublin back in November 2010 after testing positive for a substance known as methylhexaneamine (MHA). Ralepelle and  Basson were immediately banned from rugby and sent home from the tour. The supplement was supplied to them by the South African medical team. But at a hearing in Cape Town, their advocate Attie Heyns successfully challenged the ban on the basis that MHA had been downgraded by the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA). Ralepelle told the official South African Rugby Union (SARU) website: ""Finally the facts are out there and people can see that we were not guilty and are not doping cheats,"" he said. ""We were only doing what the large majority of professional rugby players around the world do by using a supplement. ""Bjorn and I were the unlucky ones to be tested on the day and to have had to go through the trauma of the past two-and-a-half months. We're both now just looking forward to playing again and closing this chapter once and for all."" The South African team, known as the Springboks, has now changed its approach to supplements and will not be issuing any to team members. The chief executive of SARU Jurie Roux added: ""This verdict completely quashes any idea that either the players or the team were guilty of any attempt to cheat. No responsibility attaches to the players at all. ""The banned stimulant was in a supplement given to the players in the warm-up before the test against Ireland and is a product that has been used by the Springboks before -- without any adverse analytical findings -- and is used by other professional and national teams in both hemispheres. ""That the players subsequently tested positive for a banned stimulant was an enormous shock to the Springbok team, management and to SARU and I am most sorry that the players have had to endure the stress and stigma attached to a failed dope test. ""Hopefully this verdict will have laid to rest any idea of any wrong doing on their part.""","Chiliboy Ralepelle and Bjorn Basson free to play rugby for South Africa again .

"(CNN) -- A man has been arrested in connection with the shooting deaths of two Michigan women, including a mother who went missing shortly after her children left on the bus for school, authorities said. Investigators found the bodies of Amy Henslee, 30, and Tonya Howarth, 36, Friday morning. They had been buried and appeared to have died after receiving multiple gunshot wounds, Van Buren County Prosecuting Attorney Juris Kaps told reporters. Henslee's husband told police she was missing Monday, prompting a police investigation in Hartford Township, Michigan. Authorities arrested an acquaintance of both women identified as Junior Lee Beebe, Kaps said. Beebe, 34, is also Henslee's husband's cousin, Kaps said.

"Editor's note: A renowned chef and restaurateur, Scottish-born Gordon Ramsay is perhaps best known in the United States for his television show ""Hell's Kitchen."" He writes here about witnessing domestic abuse as a child and what he's doing now to make sure others don't witness the same. He will appear on ""Larry King Live"" tonight at 9 ET. Chef Gordon Ramsay writes of seeing his father abuse his mother; today Ramsay fights domestic abuse. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- No child should ever have to live in fear in their own home. A home should be a place where you feel safe and loved; when I was a kid, our home was anything but that. Growing up, my father was less than a perfect role model. I watched how he battled alcoholism and how he became terribly violent with my mum, to the point where she feared for her life. Every time he got violent, any present that my brother, sisters, or I had given mum would be smashed, simply because he knew it belonged to her. There were instances when the police were called to take him away; mum was taken to the hospital while we kids were taken to a children's home. As kids, my brother, sisters and I moved around to more homes and schools than I can remember. Dad would often have a fallout with someone at work and get fired, and because our home often came with his job, we would become homeless and have to move again. To this day, I will never understand why mum stayed with him. She deserved so much better and so much more; it still pains me to remember how badly he treated her. I have four young children of my own, and I could never see myself behaving the way my father did when I was a child. I want to be a role model for my children and have them look up to me. With that said, my wife, Tana, and I are proud to be ambassadors of Women's Aid, a national charity in England working to end domestic violence against women and children. Women's Aid helps more than 320,000 women and children every year. It also supports more than 500 domestic and sexual violence services across England. Domestic violence is not identified solely by violent physical abuse; instead, it is defined as physical, sexual, psychological, financial, or emotional violence that takes place in a relationship, intimate or family-oriented. Eventually, this develops into a pattern of coercive and controlling behavior. The statistics are staggering: 1 in 4 women in the UK experience domestic violence in their lifetime, and between 6-10 percent of women suffer from domestic violence in a given year. The problem is, less than half of these incidents are reported to the police. And even still, a phone call is made to the police every single minute in the UK to report a case of domestic violence. That means police receive an estimated 1,300 calls each day and more than 570,000 each year, according to Women's Aid. I encourage everyone to help take a stand against domestic violence. My wife, Tana, and I ran the London Marathon for Women's Aid for the past two years. As ambassadors, we are pleased to say that we have received more than £5,000 in donations from friends, well-wishers and supporters of the charity. Just last week, Tana and I hosted a fundraising dinner and auction for Women's Aid in Berkeley Square in London, which helped raise more than £475,000, more than double our original target for the evening. My father passed away in 1997 after a long battle with alcoholism. These days, my mum is still my biggest supporter -- she remains there by my side through everything, and for that, I am forever grateful.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A young, female suicide bomber was behind a blast in Pakistan that killed at least 46 people and injured 105 others at a food distribution point, an official said Sunday. Zakir Hussain Afridi, the top government official in Bajaur Agency, Pakistan, said that the preliminary investigation into the explosion shows that a girl between the ages of 16 and 18 blew herself up. The determination was made from remains of the bomber that were recovered. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for Saturday's blast in that Asian nation's tribal region. Azam Tariq, the central spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, told CNN in a phone call that it targeted people who had formed what he called a pro-government and anti-Taliban group. The blast took place about 600 meters from a U.N. World Food Programme distribution point at a security checkpoint in Khar, according to Amjad Jamal, a spokesman for the agency. He said that more than 300 people were going through a security screening to get food and other items at the time of the explosion. Khar is the headquarters of Bajaur Agency, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan. Jamal said that those who had been internally displaced during military efforts in Bajaur Agency get a month's supply of food and other goods. Afridi said that the suicide bomber was in a burqa, a traditional full-body covering worn by some Muslim women. He said she was stopped for a security check at a checkpoint, where she detonated herself. The official said it was the first instance of a female suicide bomber in Pakistan that he could recall, though various international news groups have reported at least one previous case of a female suicide bomber in the country. The New York Times reported a woman detonated explosives in Peshawar in 2007, killing herself. The Pakistani Taliban denied that the bomber was a woman. ""We have thousands of male suicide bombers ready who are keenly waiting for their turns. Then why would we use a woman, which is against the traditions of Islam?"" the Pakistani Taliban's Azam Tariq said. Jamal said all staff members of the World Food Programme and its partner organizations are safe, but added that all four of the program's food distribution points in Bajaur Agency have been temporarily closed for security reasons. Still, the U.N. agency will continue to provide services elsewhere in the country, Jamal said. U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement condemning Saturday's ""outrageous terrorist attack,"" which he called ""an affront to the people of Pakistan and to all humanity."" ""The United States stands with the people of Pakistan in this difficult time, and will strongly support Pakistan's efforts to ensure greater peace, security and justice for its people,"" Obama said. The blast took place a day after about 150 militants fired at five security checkpoints in Mohmand Agency -- another of the seven districts in Pakistan's volatile tribal region along the Afghan border -- killing 11 soldiers. Security forces later killed 40 militants who were among the group, authorities said Saturday. The security forces pounded militant hideouts in Mohmand Agency with helicopter gunships, said Maqsood Amin, a senior government official in the area. Twenty-four militants were killed during retaliation Friday while 16 were targeted Saturday. CNN's Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.","An official says the suicide bomber was a teenager .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""This is an event in world history,"" is how Hollywood producer Avi Lerner hyperbolically proclaimed the news that Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were to star in his new film. De Niro and Al Pacino in a scene from their new movie ""Righteous Kill,"" out this fall. Lerner can, perhaps, be forgiven for getting a little carried away. After all, it's not every day these two Hollywood greats appear together on screen. Lerner is fully aware that by getting De Niro and Pacino to pair up in his latest venture ""Righteous Kill,"" he has hit movie paydirt. ""They were in two scenes in 'Heat.' In this movie, they are in the whole thing together,"" he tells Variety magazine. The pairing of heavyweight actors Pacino and Tribeca film festival founder De Niro is something which has tantalized film fans since their separate scenes in ""The Godfather Part II"" -- 34 years ago. With 115 films and three Oscars between them, the two stars first acted together in the 1995 thriller ""Heat,"" albeit very briefly in two unrehearsed scenes. So ""Righteous Kill"" is something of a coup for Hollywood director and producer Jon Avnet, who made 1996's ""Up Close and Personal"" and 1991's ""Fried Green Tomatoes."" The longtime friends will star as two veteran New York City detectives on the hunt for a vigilante who may be one of their own. It is prime De Niro/Pacino territory, as Lerner acknowledges in a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times. He says: ""They're playing New York City detectives; they are as New York as it gets. De Niro and Pacino the way you want to see them."" ""They're both very opaque,"" he adds. ""You don't know whether they're going to kiss someone or kill them. And that suspense is what makes their performances so intense in the moment."" ""Righteous Kill"" is a remake of a hit French thriller, ""36 Quai des Orfèvres"" -- the address of the French CID in Paris -- which also saw the pairing of Gallic cinema kings Gerard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil. De Niro, 67, said the film, to be released in September, came about because of their longstanding friendship and a desire to work on a longer project together. ""We are old friends, and he is a terrific person and great to work with and that was it you know, it was great,"" he told CNN's ""The Screening Room"" at the opening of the Tribeca film festival in New York. ""Because the other movie that we did, we had one great scene. I loved the scene we had where we meet in the restaurant and then the end of the movie. ""And 'Godfather' we were in the same movie but two different time periods, so we are in a movie now where we actually work a lot together."" Pacino, who recently turned 68, says their friendship enhances the acting experience. ""I love Bob, so it's fun,"" he told Entertainment Weekly. ""I've known him since I was a little boy. Bob wisely didn't want to rehearse our first scene together, on 'Heat.' And I'm glad he didn't. There's a comfort level that's very important. ""You can rehearse till the cows come home but that comfort level is what it's about."" Although the prospect of seeing Hollywood icons such as De Niro and Pacino on screen is one to savor for many fans, some have questioned whether this new film will be anything to write home about, based on the quality of their recent output. The two acting legends have come under fire for making questionable ""payday"" movie choices like Pacino's critically panned ""88 Minutes"" -- also produced by Lerner and directed by Avnet. Reviews for De Niro in films like ""Analyze That,"" ""Hide and Seek"" and ""Godsend"" have been similarly scathing. Some argue, perhaps unfairly, that their body of work has become so polluted by poor choices, that many have forgotten what made them so great in the first place. Perhaps this is what prompted long time collaborator Francis Ford Coppola, who directed Pacino and De Niro in ""The Godfather"" trilogy, to accuse them, along with Jack Nicholson, of lacking ambition and passion. Coppola was quoted in GQ magazine last year as saying: ""I don't feel that kind of passion to do a role and be great coming from those guys, because if it was there, they would do it! I mean, they're all in a position to do it."" Coppola later told reporters during the Rome Film Festival that the comments were ""obviously bent out of shape"" by the magazine. ""I was astonished because it wasn't true,"" he said. ""I have nothing but respect and admiration for the actors. These are the three greatest actors in the world today, and they are my friends."" However, his supposed views obviously struck a chord with others. In March, De Niro came top in a poll by the online edition of Entertainment Weekly to find ""the most shameless pay check role."" He won for agreeing to play Fearless Leader in The Adventures Of Rocky and Bulwinkle in 2000. While Los Angeles Times, film critic Patrick Goldstein accused the pair of ""becoming parodies of themselves, making payday movies that are hollow echoes of the electrically charged work they did on such films as 'Serpico,' 'Dog Day Afternoon,' 'Mean Streets' and 'Taxi Driver.' "" He added: ""If anyone has made more movies for the money than Pacino, it would be De Niro, who has largely abandoned serious dramatic work for a spate of forgettable horror and crime thrillers."" Between them Pacino and De Niro have starred in some of best films ever made, and as they approach their 70s, it would be fair to say they have earned the right to slum it a little. And as Ryan Gilbey of the Guardian newspaper puts it: ""Don't we all find the armchair that bit comfier as the years go by? ""Why should De Niro be any different just because he made his name as one of the most visceral and searching of screen performers?""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Western cinema's relationship with martial arts has been a rocky one. Like many genres, kung fu has drifted in and out of fashion, but it has never regained the same popularity as its glorious heyday in the early 1970s. There's nothing funny about either Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris. And they've got the fists to prove it. After breaking into the United States and Britain with TV hardmen like The Saint and The Green Hornet duffing up the occasional bad guy, the revolution really kicked in at the cinema. When Bruce Lee -- who had already made waves in America as the Green Hornet's karate chopping sidekick, Kato -- appeared in the Chinese-made ""Jing wu men,"" or ""Fist of Fury,"" he established himself as the genre's poster boy. Lee found initial success in his native China, but with his next movies, ""Meng long guo jiang"" (""The Way of the Dragon""), which pitted him against U.S. karate champion Chuck Norris, and the classic ""Enter the Dragon,"" he became an international star. The plots of his films all followed a set structure: our gifted hero pursues a path of revenge or tough justice, accompanied by a stiff dose of morality. In this way his characters became representatives and protectors of the less powerful who have been unjustly treated. At the same time, the U.S. TV show ""Kung Fu,"" which started in 1972, raised the profile of martial arts, and, through the lead character Caine, built an image of the patient, wise man, who uses his skills in combat as a last resort when reasoning fails, and again, is motivated entirely by his unshakeable morals. The reluctant hero isn't a new concept: he's shared by the Far East and Wild West. The lone gunman in a western, too, tends to be loath to kill, and acts as the moral enforcer in a lawless place. But while the gunman in an isolated western town still commands the same respect from movie audiences as he lays down the law, our wise eastern mystic has almost entirely disappeared from Hollywood. The biggest martial arts stars today -- with the notable exception of Jet Li, who continues to take on a mix of serious art movies in China and gang-war films set on the streets of urban America -- are either laughed at or laughed with by western audiences. Kung fu superstar Jackie Chan has the impressive reputation of being almost indestructible. He does his own stunts and puts himself in some incredibly dangerous situations. But Chan is essentially a comedian. His stunts are used, in a very similar way to Chan's cinematic hero Harold Lloyd, to amaze and amuse an audience. We are shocked that someone could do the things he does, hanging off moving buses with a walking stick, leaping across buildings. He is almost superhuman, but it's done mainly for laughs. The other major kung fu stars have become figures of mockery. The Internet was awash with Chuck Norris gags pointing out just how strong he is (""Chuck Norris does not sleep. He waits."") while Steven Seagal has done himself no favors by appearing in some of the worst films ever made. Hollywood doesn't take them seriously -- and nor do we. Directors have also mocked the 70s obsession with kung fu that gripped the western world, with heroes from films such as ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Austin Powers"" and ""Starsky and Hutch"" fighting with cod seriousness while displaying laughable skills. So what has changed? Kung fu is not inherently funny. No matter how many times you watch ""Enter the Dragon,"" it never ceases to be awe-inspiring. Perhaps the answer is simple: we Hollywood film junkies have grown cynical. There is no room in our modern world for an unexplained, almost supernatural power against pointlessly evil adversaries. Have we have lost our ability to suspend our disbelief? So what can a real fan do? Are we condemned to trawling the movies of the 1970s in order to get our kung fu hit, harking back to a time when Chuck Norris really was feared and respected everywhere he went? The answer is no. While Hollywood seems to have dumped its one-time darling, kung fu is alive and flourishing in Asia, where it all started. Jet Li puts out some great offerings in China, and there is a rising star in the form of Tony Jaa, a Thai actor with amazing technical skill, whose films like ""Ong Bak"" have wowed audiences across the world. While Hollywood misses a trick and spends all its time laughing at its most skillful martial artists, the industry in Asia is doing what it has always done: bringing us all the high kicks, karate chops and spinning nunchucks we could ever want.

"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN) -- Honduran soldiers shot out the tires of buses headed for a demonstration in support of ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya, a video obtained by CNN shows. This image from a cell phone video shows Honduran soldiers shooting out the tires of a bus. The video, believed shot within the past two days, shows a line of buses stopped on a road in what is reported to be the city of Limones. The city is about 70 miles (112 kilometers) northeast of the capital, Tegucigalpa. A noisy, chaotic crowd is milling around the buses while soldiers move among them. Some slight pushing can be seen. ""The people united can never be defeated,"" many crowd members chant in unison. Gunfire is heard and the crowd grows quieter. More shots are heard and then the video shows soldiers shooting out the tires on a yellow bus. Air hissing from a tire can be heard and the video shows a flattened tire.  Watch the soldiers shoot the tires » . The recording was made on a phone camera by Zelaya supporter Oscar Baron and made available to CNN. Another video of the same incident was posted on the Youtube Internet site Thursday under the title ""Golpe de estado en Honduras"" (Coup in Honduras). CNN reporters in Honduras have received reports from Zelaya supporters who say troops have stopped buses bringing protesters from the countryside to prevent them from attending rallies in Tegucigalpa. Honduran military officials said they were unaware of any such incidents. ""I have not been informed of this incident. I cannot confirm or deny it,"" Honduran Army spokesman Col. Ramiro Archaga told CNN by phone. The military's main job is to protect the nation's borders, Archaga said, ""not guaranteeing internal security."" Hector Ivan Mejia, spokesman for the Security Ministry, said he had no information of buses being fired upon. ""Protesters will be arrested for vandalic acts but they will not simply be stopped on their way to protests,"" Mejia said. The military removed Zelaya from power Sunday and flew him to nearby Costa Rica. Congressional leader Roberto Micheletti was sworn in that afternoon as interim president. Pro-Zelaya protesters have skirmished with troops in some parts of Tegucigalpa, but the incidents have received little mention from Honduran TV stations. Instead, the stations have given wide coverage to large demonstrations in support of Micheletti. The United Nations and the Organization of American States have condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated. The United States and most countries in Latin America also have criticized the coup. The United States and the World Bank have suspended some aid and many nations have recalled their ambassadors from Honduras. In an emergency meeting late Tuesday, the OAS gave Honduras 72 hours to reinstate Zelaya or face suspension from the 35-nation hemispheric organization. That deadline expires Saturday and the OAS has scheduled a 1 p.m. meeting to discuss the situation. OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza arrived Friday afternoon in Honduras to notify ""stakeholders"" of the terms of the resolution, the organization said. Zelaya, a leftist who took office in 2006, has said he will return to Honduras after Saturday's deadline. Micheletti said Zelaya would be arrested if he returns. At the center of the dispute was a referendum Zelaya had vowed to carry out even after the country's supreme court and congress found it illegal. The nonbinding referendum could have led to the creation of a constitutional assembly to modify the country's charter to allow the president to run for re-election. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a Zelaya ally, won a similar referendum this year and many Hondurans thought Zelaya was trying to maneuver a way to seek re-election in November. Zelaya has denied that was his intent. Zelaya narrowly won the presidency in 2005 with 49.8 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent for Porfirio ""Pepe"" Lobo. After 18 years of nearly uninterrupted military rule, Honduras returned to civilian control in 1981. Since then, the military has not seemed interested in holding power in the nation of more than 7 million people, about 70 percent of whom live in poverty. Military interventions were once common in Latin America, but civilian governments have held sway since the 1980s. Before Sunday, the only other barracks revolt this decade was an unsuccessful 2002 coup attempt against Chavez, when the military displaced him but backed down days later and allowed his reinstatement.

"(CNN) -- A program on Iran's government-backed Press TV recently took a woman convicted of adultery and murder back to her home in Osku ""to produce a visual account"" of the death of her husband ""at the crime scene."" Press TV posted a story on its website early Friday morning explaining that the program ""Iran Today,"" which will air Friday night, would include interviews with -- among others -- Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who was sentenced to be stoned to death. Press TV's release of still photographs of Ashtiani and her son from the interview, which took place on Sunday, fueled some speculation that they had been released, but there was no evidence or confirmation to support that conjecture. In a clip from the program that aired late Thursday, Ashtiani confesses to plotting to kill her husband. Her family, however, has denied she was involved in her husband's death. Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006 and sentenced to death by stoning. She became the subject of enormous international outcry over the summer when her sentence became public knowledge. Officials ranging from Pope Benedict XVI to the European Union's top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, urged Iran not to carry out the sentence. Two German journalists who interviewed Ashtiani were arrested in October and charged with espionage. He son and lawyer also were arrested, but it was not clear on what charges.

"(CNN)  -- Top seed and world number one Rafael Nadal of Spain has been knocked out of the Australian Open by compatriot and ""friend"" David Ferrer. Hampered by a thigh strain from the start of Wednesday's quarterfinal, the nine-time grand slam champion was visibly suffering as he went down 6-4 6-2 6-3 at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena to his Davis Cup teammate. Ferrer's triumph -- his fourth over Nadal from 15 encounters -- will now see the 28-year-old play in just his second grand slam semifinal, following his appearance in the last four of the U.S. Open in 2007. The world number seven will face Britain's Andy Murray for a place in the final of the opening grand slam of 2011, after the world number five beat unseeded Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov in the earlier match. Top 10 moments of the Australian Open first week . The result also means the end to 24-year-old Nadal's quest to become the first man since Australia's Rod Laver in 1969, to win four consecutive grand slam titles. Nadal was clearly affected by a thigh problem during the match but, despite receiving off-court treatment after just the third game, refused to blame the loss on his injury. The Mallorcan was instead full of praise for his opponent, who broke serve in the opening game on his way to taking the first set, when his spoke to reporters after the match. ""For respect to the winner and to a friend, I prefer to talk about the match,"" Nadal said. ""It is obvious that I didn't feel at my best. I had a problem during the match, at the very beginning. I really couldn't do more than what I did. He played at a very high level, and I wasn't able to compete against him tonight."" Nadal showed flashes of his usual brilliance but any chance of a comeback in the second set was suppressed by Ferrer, who after a 10-minute break in proceedings for an Australia Day fireworks display, secured a double break of serve to lead the match by two sets to love. Ferrer then raced to a 3-0 lead in what was to be the third and final set, before wrapping up the ultimately one-sided contest in just over two and a half hours. ""I just congratulate him and wish him all the best for the semifinal. I think he's doing a fantastic tournament,"" Nadal added. ""If he keeps playing like this, he's going to have a good chance."" But Ferrer, who is unbeaten so far this season having won the Australian Open warm-up tournament in Auckland, New Zealand, said he could not be complacent if he wants to beat the in-form Murray. ""I played very consistently all the three sets and I was focused just in my game. I want to enjoy this moment,"" Ferrer told the official ATP Tour website. ""I will try to do my best, but I need to play very consistently, stay very focused all the match, because Andy's a top player."" Clijsters faces Zvonareva rematch in Australian Open semifinals . Murray dropped his first set of the tournament so far to world number 46 Dolgopolov, before eventually winning  7-5 6-3 6-7 6-3. The 22-year-old Dolgopolov has been a revelation in Australia, defeating 2008 runner-up Jo Wilfred Tsonga and two-time French Open finalist Robin Soderling on the way to his first grand slam quarterfinal. ""I thought I dealt with his game well. It was just difficult to get into a rhythm. I did quite a lot of running,"" Murray said. ""He won a lot of free points off his first serve.

Murray is aiming to reach his second consecutive final in Melbourne after losing to Roger Federer in 2010, and the third grand slam final of his career after also facing the Swiss in the 2008 U.S. Open final. But the 23-year-old, who is also trying to become the first Briton to win a major title since Fred Perry in 1936, conceded that his quarterfinal opponent could prove a threat to him in future competitions. ""With his game style, he's going to give a lot of guys problems. He might be a little bit inconsistent from time to time but when his game's on, I'm sure he'll get deep into grand slams and the big tournaments just because of how tricky his game is,"" the Scot added.

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities have identified a suspect in the armed robberies of 10 banks in four states, crediting surveillance photos they posted on electronic billboards throughout the South. The FBI says this surveillance image shows Chad Schaffner, who they say robbed at least 10 banks this year. Chad E. Schaffner, who was released from Indiana's prison system last year following an armed robbery conviction, was identified as the man on the billboards, making him a suspect in the robberies in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, the FBI said Thursday. Schaffner may have been in the Morristown, Tennessee, area this week, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. A woman believed to have had a brief relationship with him alleges he was in her Morristown-area apartment and threatened to kill her children if she told authorities he was there, an FBI special agent says in the complaint. The FBI posted photos of the robberies, occurring from May to last week, on electronic billboards in eight Southern states, in part because the robber made no apparent attempt to cover his face. Surveillance images showed a man with tattooed arms, close-cropped hair and a goatee pointing a pistol. The FBI posted the images as part of a partnership with owners of electronic billboards. ""This case is an emblematic example of the importance of public/private sector alliances in bringing criminals to justice in today's information age,"" Richard Lambert, special agent in charge of the FBI's Knoxville, Tennessee, division, said in a news release Thursday. No one was hurt in the robberies, but Schaffner, who turns 37 on Monday, should be considered armed and dangerous, the FBI said. ""This guy has made no effort to hide the gun,"" FBI agent Kevin Keithley said earlier this week, before Schaffner was named a suspect. ""He has threatened the use of it in every bank robbery he has committed. He has put the gun in the faces of tellers, threatened to use the gun against them."" Schaffner is white and about 6 feet tall, weighs 200 pounds, and has brown hair, brown eyes and tattoos on his forearms, the FBI said. He may be driving a black 1994 GMC Jimmy pickup truck with Tennessee license plate 360 WLN or a red 1994 Chevrolet S10 pickup with South Carolina license plate EVE 177, according to the FBI. Anyone with information on his whereabouts should call the FBI or local law enforcement, the FBI said. The last two bank robberies happened in Morristown and Jefferson City, Tennessee, on August 18. On Tuesday -- a day after the billboards started showing images of the robberies -- a man told the FBI that Schaffner was in the Morristown area at the time of the last two holdups, according to the complaint filed in court. The man said he'd known Schaffner for about two months, the complaint says. FBI agents also twice interviewed the Morristown-area woman this week, having heard she'd had a two-week relationship with Schaffner, according to the complaint. During the first interview, she told agents outside her apartment that she didn't know him, the complaint says. The next day, she told authorities that she did know Schaffner, and that he had been in her apartment with her children while she talked with the agents outside, the complaint says. She said he threatened to kill the children if she told the agents about him, according to the complaint. She told authorities that after the agents left, Schaffner left the area in a vehicle, according to the complaint. A warrant was issued Thursday for Schaffner's arrest. He has been charged in U.S. District Court in Tennessee's eastern district with two counts of bank robbery and two counts of use of a firearm during a bank robbery. Schaffner was released from an Indiana prison in December, the FBI said. He was convicted of armed robbery in Indianapolis, Indiana, and sentenced in June 2008. He has several other convictions in Indiana, including for burglary, armed robbery, resisting law enforcement and purchase of a handgun without a license, according to the Indiana Department of Correction.","Chad Schaffner named suspect in 10 bank robberies in four states .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Bad dubbing, angry men with extraordinary facial hair, balletic fighting and more blood than you can shake a nunchuck at: just some of the key ingredients to make a perfect kung fu flick. Tony Jaa may be the modern day Bruce Lee, and in ""Ong-bak"" he shows off his impressive skills. Whether it's a traditional tale of ancient Chinese fighting mystics, or a slickly made, modern bloodfest, kung fu has always been a rich part of cinema. We've compiled a list of 10 of the best. Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Share your views by using the Sound Off box below and we'll publish the best. 1. Enter the Dragon (Robert Clouse, 1973) Bruce Lee's last movie before his untimely death, this is him at his very best. A man on a revenge mission, Lee travels to a mysterious island to fight in a deadly tournament hosted by an evil billionaire. Along with being technically amazing -- the nunchucks scene is jaw-dropping -- it's the most stylish and iconic martial arts film ever made. 2. Ong-bak (Prachya Pinkaew, 2003) Tony Jaa is a modern master. He has appeared in very few major releases, but has already made a huge impact. ""Ong-bak"" is the perfect showcase for his extraordinary skills: whether he's fighting a roomful of people or taking part in the most exciting chase we have ever seen -- jumping through rings of barbed wire and sliding under moving cars while doing the splits -- he makes this film every bit the martial arts spectacle. 3. Wong Fei Hung (Once Upon a Time in China) (Hark Tsui, 1991) Part Chinese history, part gripping kung fu movie, this eastern epic has Jet Li demonstrating his talents as the eponymous hero who stands up to invading foreign forces in 19th century China. Armed with a limitless arsenal of martial arts moves, Li takes on masses of gun-toting, badly acting opponents. A visual delight and Jet Li's best work. 4. Kill Bill 1 & 2 (Quentin Tarantino, 2003/2004) Quentin Tarantino is a movie geek -- specifically, a B-movie geek -- and kung fu has long held a place in his heart. ""Kill Bill,"" his tribute to the genre, ticks every box: revenge; a powerful, all-knowing nemesis; stylish fights, costumes and music; and blood, lots and lots of blood. 5. Wo hu cang long (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) (Ang Lee, 2000) Every eye-catching detail of this touching and beautiful film works. A love story with outlaws, witches and Shaolin monks is augmented by breathtaking cinematography and some fantastic performances from Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh and newcomer Ziyi Zhang. This visual feast tugs at the heart strings better than any karate chop could. 6. The Karate Kid (John G. Avildsen, 1984) A simple but well-executed plot sees Ralph Macchio's underdog work his way up an unconventional path to take on the mean and nasty establishment. It spawned a spate of copycat films, while thousands of children signed up to after-school karate; everyone now knows how to defend themselves by waxing on or off and that the best fighting move is obviously The Crane. Hiya! 7. Ging chaat goo si (Police Story) (Jackie Chan, 1985) Jackie Chan is probably China's biggest export to Hollywood, well-known for doing his own death-defying stunts. This is one of the films that got him noticed in the United States. When he fights, Chan is unstoppable: he uses every prop on the set and puts himself in enormous physical danger. Out and out fun. 8. Shogun Assassin (Robert Houston, 1980) Referenced several times in Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" films, this forgotten classic must have set a record for the amount of blood spilt as our hero crosses the country on a revenge mission. Early on, Tomisaburo Wakayama says ""they will pay with rivers of blood""; he isn't wrong. Violent and wonderful. 9. Siu lam juk kau (Shaolin Soccer) (Stephen Chow, 2001) Should this be in the best or worst list? It's definitely unique. Once described as ""the best kung fu football film of all time,"" this is one of the more ridiculous films of the genre. A group of down-and-out martial arts experts form a five-a-side football team to take on a group of evil, drug-taking clones. It's as simple, and as silly as that. And it's one of our guiltiest pleasures. 10. The Matrix (Andy and Larry Wachowski, 1999) A sci-fi spin on the genre, this modern classic has all the key elements: our hero has superhuman powers; the bad guys, led by the relentless Agent Smith, form part of a shady, all-powerful organization intent on oppressing humankind; and the fight scenes are fantastically technical. Against all the odds, it appears Keanu really does know Kung Fu. .................................... Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Read others' comments and share your views by using the Sound Off box below. .................................... And the mainstream films that lacked the killer punch ... Street Fighter (Steven E. de Souza, 1994) Jean-Claude Van Damme has made some good films, really he has. ""Kickboxer"" nearly made it into our top 10. But this is, by a huge margin, his worst effort. Most depressing, though, is that this was the last major outing for Raul Julia -- not the way he should be remembered. Great game; terrible film. The Karate Kid, Part III (John G. Avildsen, 1989) The franchise came out of part two with a little credibility intact, but this last installment -- unless you include ""The Next Karate Kid"" (which no self-respecting ""Karate Kid"" fan would) -- managed to kill off our last shred of enthusiasm. Where the original might have inspired you to take up karate, this would put you off the sport, and probably kung fu movies too. Bulletproof Monk (Paul Hunter, 2003) ""I've got a great idea, let's take a well-respected Chinese actor and pair him up with an annoying teen-film actor in a mystical kung fu movie; it can't fail!"" Unsurprisingly, this film was a disaster, shoe-horning silly fight scenes into a plot that spirals from implausible to disturbingly stupid. A frightful mistake, and one of our worst-named films to boot. Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (Geoff Murphy, 1995) The first ""Under Siege"" was a surprisingly good film, and Hollywood's best martial arts expert acquits himself well, but this follow up is laughable. Seagal still fights like the best, but has lost the ability to speak, and whispers his way through the dialogue. Considering the action takes place on a train, we were amazed his co-stars could hear him. Come on, Steven, you were so much better when you were just a lowly, lowly cook. Game of Death (Robert Clouse, 1978) Through no fault of his own, this is Bruce Lee's posthumous contribution to the list. This tacky movie features fight scenes shot before Lee died, interspersed with material filmed using lookalikes and a cardboard cutout of the great man. The fights are impressive, but the rest of the film smacks of a cash-in -- they even use footage from Lee's actual funeral. A desperate slur on Lee's memory.

"(Health.com) -- Electroshock therapy today bears little resemblance to its lurid depictions in Hollywood dramas like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" For decades psychiatrists have used shock therapy to treat cases of depression that haven't been helped by antidepressant medications, and in recent years the treatment -- now known as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) -- has experienced something of a revival. Roughly 100,000 people in the U.S. now receive it each year. The future of ECT is in doubt, however. On Thursday, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel will meet to consider whether the machines used in ECT should be more tightly regulated than they are now. If the advisory panel votes for more oversight -- and if the FDA follows the panel's advice, as it usually does -- some experts fear that access to the treatment will be curtailed. Health.com: Hysteria, demons, and more: depression throughout history . ECT machines are currently in a strictly controlled category of medical devices that includes pacemakers and prosthetic joints. As with prescription drugs, devices in this class must be approved by the FDA before they can be used on patients. But because ECT devices were already in use when the FDA put those rules in place about 35 years ago, they were exempted from the approval process. The FDA is now revisiting the status of the devices. The agency can leave ECT devices in their current class and require manufacturers to provide evidence of safety and effectiveness, which may entail new clinical trials and could temporarily limit the devices' use. Or it can rely on existing evidence and reclassify the devices to a less restrictive category that includes ultrasound machines, motorized wheelchairs, and contact-lens solution. That option would give ECT devices a pass and ensure that they remain available to doctors. The impending FDA action has reawakened the debate surrounding this controversial treatment for depression and other mental disorders. More than 1,500 organizations and individuals have filed formal comments with the FDA. Health.com: 10 things to say (and not say) to someone with depression . The American Psychiatric Association (APA) and scores of individual psychiatrists have expressed support for permanently easing the restrictions on ECT devices, because they worry that manufacturers of ECT devices may lack the funds, time, or motivation to meet new FDA requirements (by conducting new research, for instance). ""It may be a major disaster,"" says Max Fink, MD, a professor emeritus of psychiatry and neurology at Stony Brook University Medical Center, in New York, who researched and performed ECT for 45 years. ""If they want an extensive review of safety and efficacy, that means somebody has to pay for it. It becomes a very expensive proposition and there is nobody to do it unless the government supports it. The manufacturers are all small companies in the U.S. There's no General Electric for ECT devices."" On the other side, patients' rights organizations and advocacy groups such as the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) have urged the FDA not to hastily reclassify ECT devices. Those groups argue that the treatment and the potential side effects -- such as memory loss and brain damage -- are serious enough to merit a thorough review. Health.com: 7 types of therapy that can help depression . And for good measure, the Church of Scientology and related anti-psychiatry groups have joined the fray, calling for an outright ban on ECT and flooding the FDA with comments that call the treatment ""barbaric,"" ""evil,"" and ""criminal."" The evolution of shock therapy . ECT was first used on a human patient in Italy in 1938, after preliminary experiments in dogs and pigs. The treatment involves delivering electric currents to the brain in order to induce a seizure, which, in turn, seems to alleviate depression. (No one knows exactly how ECT works.) Early ECT treatments were more primitive than those used today, and in some cases they did cause harm to patients, including memory loss, burns from the electrodes placed on the patient's skull, and bone fractures resulting from violent muscle contractions during the seizure. These grisly scenes are now a thing of the past, advocates of the treatment say, thanks to improvements in devices and protocols. ""We have not had an injury of any kind from ECT in years,"" Dr. Fink says. An ECT session generally lasts no more than 10 to 20 minutes, and the bulk of that time is spent waiting for the general anesthesia to kick in and wear off. The electrical current is on for a few seconds or less, and the seizure lasts for about 20 to 60 seconds, says D.P. Devanand, MD, director of geriatric psychiatry at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, in New York City. Health.com: What ECT feels like . The procedure is relatively drama-free. General anesthesia tends to shorten the seizures, and doctors now give patients muscle relaxants that reduce spasms and even ""visible movement,"" says Dr. Devanand, who ran Columbia's ECT Service for 15 years. The placement of the electrodes has also been refined, making ECT much safer, according to William Narrow, MD, the APA's associate director of research. ""ECT does not cause brain damage,"" Dr. Devanand says. ""Memory loss today is very limited in most cases, and the loss is patchy and primarily for events during and just before and following the ECT course. So the patient may not remember one of the nurses on the ward but will recognize the other nurses."" The treatment is very effective in the short term, Dr. Narrow says. Roughly 80% to 95% of patients experience a full remission from their depression symptoms, he estimates, although some patients need repeat sessions to keep their severe depression from coming back. And unlike antidepressants, which can take weeks to kick in, some patients start experiencing improvement after their first one or two ECT treatments. Health.com: 10 surprising facts about antidepressants . A charged debate . In 2009, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which investigates and audits government agencies, urged the FDA to lift the grandfather clause that exempted ECT devices (and many other types of devices) from the FDA approval process. Disability and mental health advocates welcomed this development as an opportunity for ECT to receive a long-overdue review of its safety and effectiveness. If the devices are reclassified, on the other hand, ""the rigorous scientific safety investigation of these devices may never take place -- preventing patients from making informed choices about their treatment,"" the DBSA wrote in a 2009 letter to the FDA. But the APA and other supporters of reclassification claim that ECT has been researched enough to address these concerns. ""We have a growing body of evidence to support the fact that ECT is safe and effective,"" Dr. Narrow says. ""We think it would be a waste of money and effort to go through a new application process, because the amount of research that's already been done in the past 30 years is so great."" Nancy Koenigsberg, the legal director of Disability Rights New Mexico, one of many independent statewide disability agencies that have lined up against the reclassification of ECT devices, questions the quality of the existing research. ""There are concerns about who's done [the] studies and whether they are, in fact, appropriate scientific studies or whether they're pushed by the APA or pushed by manufacturers,"" Koenigsberg says. ""We're calling into question...whether the studies are, in fact, unbiased studies."" The FDA's neurological devices advisory panel is scheduled to discuss ECT devices on January 27 and 28.

"(CNN)  -- He has been captured by bank surveillance cameras in four states, sneering and holding a pistol sideways during heists. The FBI is searching for this suspect, who they say has robbed at least 10 banks in the South. Now authorities hope to catch the serial bank robber by plastering his image on electronic billboards throughout the South. The FBI is searching for the suspect, who they say has robbed at least 10 banks in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. The brazen bandit has been captured in surveillance footage sporting the same close-cropped hairstyle and goatee in many of the holdups. He does not seem to make any effort to cover his face and sometimes is seen aiming a handgun sideways, showing his tattoos on both forearms as he gestures at bank employees. ""It is uncommon to come in to a bank and show his face like he does,"" said FBI agent Kevin Keithley.  Watch how the FBI hunts bank robbers » . The FBI has tracked the bank robber's path on a map that crisscrosses the southern United States. The billboards that went up Monday roughly follow the path that the bank robber took, the FBI said. The billboards are in Alabama, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, the FBI said in a statement. His odyssey has spanned more than 600 miles north, from Charleston, South Carolina, to Louisville, Kentucky, and about 500 miles east, from Knoxville, Tennessee, to Edenton, North Carolina. The robberies started in May and the most recent one was last week in Tennessee, Keithley said. The suspect is described as white, about 25 years old, 5 feet 9 to 5 feet 11, 170 to 175 pounds. He has short, reddish-brown hair and an unshaven goatee, the FBI said. The suspect has not yet harmed anybody in the robberies but the FBI considers him extremely dangerous. ""This guy has made no effort to hide the gun,"" Keithley said. ""He has threatened the use of it in every bank robbery he has committed. He has put the gun in the faces of tellers, threatened to use the gun against them. So we want to get this guy in custody before he harms anyone.""  In surveillance video of a robbery in Fletcher, North Carolina, the suspect is seen talking into a handheld radio, said an FBI official involved in the investigation. In a South Carolina robbery, a wireless phone device is seen on his ear. ""That prompted us to look at the prospect of another suspect out there helping him, and we continue to look for that angle but have no leads into that as of now,"" the FBI official said. Authorities are also working with police agencies, corrections departments and others who use facial recognition technology, the official said, and are working with corrections departments on tattoo identifications, recorded by prisons in some states. Since the national billboard program began in 2008, the billboards have been directly responsible for the apprehension of at least 20 fugitives, said Stephen Emmett, spokesman for the FBI's Atlanta office. ""We try to reserve the billboards for the more mobile, more egregious, violent offenders, because we understand we're pulling resources away from a corporate entity, and we try not to take advantage of that,"" he said. ""But they are a very valuable tool to law enforcement in these type of cases where the individual is highly mobile and very dangerous."" The bank robbery suspect has distinctive tattoos on his forearms, Emmett noted. ""Somebody will recognize these tattoos. Somebody will recognize this individual. The remarkable thing about this serial bank robber is that he did not attempt whatsoever to disguise himself. The photographs from these cases are very good, very detailed. The public will know who this individual is."" He said his past experience, as well as statistics, show that ""there are addiction issues with the majority of these bank robbers, and that provides a bad additional ingredient to this bank robbery scenario. You have an individual going into a bank with a gun, in a reckless manner, and now he might actually be on drugs and strung out on drugs. So that makes this even more imperative, to get this individual off the street before anybody gets hurt and to get him the help that he needs."" Robbing banks is not as lucrative as the public might believe, he said, and ""with addiction-type motives by these robbers, they tend to get only enough money to get their next fix."" It's possible the suspect's family members may not know of his activities, Emmett said. ""He's an individual that we want off of the street in the worst way,"" he said, ""and we feel these billboards are a tool. We feel the photographs from the banks are going to make that happen."" The FBI asks anybody who knows the bank robber or who has information in the case to call 423-282-8090. A reward is being offered. CNN's John Murgatroyd contributed to this report.","Bank robbery suspect does not seem to make any effort to cover his face .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- An American father jailed in Tokyo has been harshly treated, his attorney said Monday, while Japanese authorities said he is getting ""special"" treatment. Christopher Savoie is in jail in Japan after trying to get back his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca. Attorney Jeremy Morley, in a statement released Monday, said Christopher Savoie -- accused of trying to kidnap his children after his ex-wife took them to Japan -- is being held without trial, interrogated without an attorney present and denied needed medical treatment for high blood pressure.   Savoie has also been exposed to sleep deprivation, and denied private meetings with attorneys and phone calls to his wife, according to Morley, who said the way his client has been treated amounts to ""torture.""   He acknowledged that some of the claims are based on second-hand information from Savoie's wife, Amy, saying she has communicated with people familiar with her husband's case. Police in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan where Savoie is being held, denied the allegations in Morley's statement, saying Savoie gets regular visits by a physician and medicine as prescribed. A Yanagawa police officer, who declined to give his name citing departmental policy, told CNN that Savoie, like any other detainee, has a ""dim"" light in his cell for safety, and is assured to get 8 hours of sleep a day. Savoie is being questioned -- with an interpreter -- within the boundaries of Japanese law, which allows for suspects to be interviewed without the presence of an attorney, the officer said. The law also permits several rounds of questioning for hours on end, the officer said. The officer said Savoie is allowed ""frequent"" visits with his defense attorney in Japan and is generally given ""special"" treatment due to the nature of his case, the officer said. ""If you call this 'torture,' what can we say?"" the officer said. Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, allegedly abducted his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his ex-wife walked them to school on September 28 in Yanagawa. With the children, Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate, in the city of Fukuoka, to try to obtain passports for them. Screaming at guards to let him in the compound, Savoie was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested. Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before their bitter divorce in January. The couple, both citizens of the United States and Japan, lived in Japan, but had moved to the United States before the divorce. Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States. Christopher Savoie had visitation rights. During the summer, she fled with the children to Japan, according to court documents. A U.S. court then granted Christopher Savoie sole custody. Japanese law, however, recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian, regardless of the U.S. court order. The law there also follows a tradition of sole-custody divorces. When a couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and life-long break from the children. Complicating the matter further is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan because they never divorced there, police said. And, Japanese authorities say, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports.","Official in Japan denies ""torture,"" says dad is receiving ""special"" treatment .

"(CNN) -- World No. 3 Kim Clijsters remains on course to win a second consecutive grand slam singles title after overcoming a challenge from Agnieszka Radwanska to reach the semifinals of the Australian Open. The U.S. Open champion battled past 12th seed Radwanska of Poland 6-3 7-6 (7-4) in Wednesday's quarterfinal to reach the last four in Melbourne for the sixth time in her career. The Belgian third seed will face world No. 2 Vera Zvonareva on Thursday for a place in the final -- a repeat of September's title clash at Flushing Meadows. Zvonareva, runner-up at the last two grand slams after also losing to Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final, took just over an hour to dispatch of Czech 25th seed Petra Kvitova 6-2 6-4. Top 10 moments of the Australian Open first week . The Russian second seed was full of praise for her 20-year-old Czech opponent, who knocked out home favorite and world number five Sam Stosur on her way to her second grand slam quarterfinal, matching her feat at Wimbledon in 2010. ""At 6-2 3-0 I was trying to keep playing the same way I was playing, but she really lifted her game,"" the 26-year-old Zvonareva told reporters. ""She's a very good player. She took that opportunity, that little chance I gave her, and used it to get back into the match. I'm happy with the way I handled the situation during those moments, though."" Clijsters, meanwhile, faced arguably her toughest test so far in world No. 14 Radwanska, who was playing in her first tournament for three months following a foot injury. But despite losing a 4-1 lead in the first set and going down a break of serve early in the second, the more experienced Clijsters closed out the match to make the semifinals in Australia for the first time since her brief period of retirement from the game in 2008. ""I felt a little bit tired and heavy out there today, but I fought well and stayed really focused, and tried not to lose too much energy on getting frustrated,"" the mother-of-one told the official WTA Tour website. The 27-year-old admitted that she would have to improve in order to add the Australian Open title to the three grand slam singles crowns she has already won in New York in 2005, 2009 and 2010. ""Everything has to be better. The serving, the returning, the unforced errors -- everything. But I'm in the semifinals and I don't feel I've played my best tennis, so that's a good thing,"" she said. ""I'm hanging in there. Sometimes it's more of an achievement than winning your matches very easily."" In Thursday's other semifinal, world number one Caroline Wozniacki will play Chinese ninth seed Li Na after the pair both won their quarterfinal matches on Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Roger Federer secured his place in the Australian Open semifinals on Tuesday after a straight-sets dismissal of Stanislas Wawrinka. Federer, 29, moved into the final four at Melbourne Park for an eighth consecutive year thanks to a 6-1 6-3 6-3 triumph over his Swiss compatriot. Sixteen-time grand slam winner Federer took control of the match early after he broke 19th seed Wawrinka in his first service game, before the second seed wrapped up victory in one hour and 47 minutes. ""I think it was a good match for me really,"" Federer told the ATP Tour's website. ""I started off well. Was able to serve and return really well. What are your top ten Australian Open moments? ""I expected him to even serve bigger today because the ball travels faster through the air. For some reason I was able to return him well."" The sights of magic Melbourne . The clash at the Rod Laver Arena -- which saw the gold medal winning doubles team from the 2008 Beijing Olympics go head-to-head -- was the first time two Swiss men had met in the quarterfinals of a major tournament. Wawrinka, the Chennai Open champion, admitted that Federer, who recently won the Qatar Open, was the better man on the day. ""For sure I'm disappointed to lose,"" Wawrinka said. ""But I think he was just playing too good. For sure, you look at the match from outside you don't see how good he was playing. ""But he was always giving me some answer, and he was just being really too good for me."" Federer's opponent in his semifinal will be third seed Novak Djokovic, who fired past Czech Tomas Berdych 6-1 7-6 (7-5) 6-1. Serbia's Djokovic, a champion in Melbourne in 2008, had the upper hand in the opening exchanges as he wrapped up the first set in 38 minutes. Sixth seed Berdych rallied in the second set and took it to a tie-break, only to see his forehand shot clip the net and bounce out of bounds with the score level at 5-5. Djokovic, 23, won the tie-break and consequently the match  to set up a rematch of the 2010 U.S. Open semifinal against Federer in the last four. ""I was trying to change the pace and put him out of his comfort zone,"" Djokovic, who beat Federer in the Flushing Meadows semifinal, told Australian broadcaster Seven Sport.

"(CNN) -- The president of Botswana has invited the internationally recognized president of Ivory Coast, Alassane Ouattara, for an official state visit, the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Botswana announced Wednesday. President Seretse Khama Ian Khama has discussed the visit with Ouattara, the ministry said in a statement, and the two leaders ""agreed that the visit should take place at a mutually convenient time."" But it's not clear when that time may come, since Ouattara is virtually blocked inside the Golf Hotel in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, by troops sent by Laurent Gbagbo, who claimed the presidency after the November 28 runoff. While an independent electoral commission declared Ouattara the winner, the country's Constitutional Council invalidated the results in some provinces and proclaimed that Gbagbo, the incumbent president, had won. Gbagbo is refusing to step down . ""Botswana continues to support all efforts aimed at ensuring that Ouattara assumes the presidency in Cote d'Ivore,"" the ministry statement said, using the French name for the country. Immediately after the election in Ivory Coast, Botswana joined the African Union, the United Nations, the European Union and the United States in endorsing Ouattara as the winner of the disputed presidential elections. At the time, Khama's government called upon all political entities, including the Constitutional Council of Ivory Coast, to respect the decision of the Independent Electoral Commission in declaring Ouattara the rightful winner of the elections. ""The government of Botswana is deeply concerned about African leaders who reject elections results that are not in their favour. ""Such actions not only deny people the right to have leaders of their choice, but also thwart efforts to maintain peace and security on the African continent,"" the statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation says. Botswana took similar actions two years ago after controversial parliamentary and presidential elections in neighboring Zimbabwe, declaring that Robert Mugabe was not democratically elected and saying it would not recognize him as that country's leader. Botswana officials also vowed not to attend any AU or Southern African Development Community (SADC) meetings if Mugabe was invited. However, the government of Botswana softened its stance after Mugabe and his rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, formed a national unity government to ease Zimbabwe's economic and political predicament. Botswana also did not recognise the leadership of Andry Rajoelina, after he was sworn in early last year as the transitional president of Madagascar. The government of Botswana issued a statement saying the former disc jockey and mayor of Madagascar's capital should hand over power to the constitutionally elected leader Marc Ravalomanana. Rajoelina and his military-led supporters forced Ravalomanana to step down, and although Rajoelina entered into a power-sharing agreement, it has yet to be implemented.","Botswana recognizes Ouattara as the rightful winner of Ivory Coast's election .

"HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Pennsylvania's acting secretary of labor and industry has entered a rehabilitation program for at least two weeks after her arrest on a public drunkenness charge last week. Sandi Vito, Pennsylvania's acting labor secretary, has entered a rehab program, the governor's spokesman says. Just a few hours before her arrest, Sandi Vito backed out of a scheduled interview with a CNN correspondent about the state's controversial use of debit cards to pay unemployment benefits. Vito, who was appointed acting secretary of labor and industry in February 2008, ""has entered a treatment program for two weeks,"" according to Gov. Ed Rendell's chief spokesman. ""The governor awaits her return before making any final decisions on her future,"" the spokesman, Chuck Ardo, told CNN on Monday. CNN had been invited to a public appearance that Vito was making in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, to ask her about the fees banks impose when people choose to receive their unemployment benefits by debit cards instead of checks.  Watch how bank fees can surprise people on unemployment » . Those fees range from forty cents to check a balance by telephone, to $1.75 if the debit card is used outside the two free withdrawal periods banks allow. Approximately 925,000 Pennsylvanians were unemployed last month and most used debit cards to receive payments, Pennsylvania officials said. ""Arrangements have been made for you to interview Department of Labor & Industry Acting Secretary Sandi Vito in Allentown tomorrow at approximately 1 p.m., to discuss our unemployment compensation debit card program,"" David Smith, a spokesman for the department, e-mailed CNN prior to the scheduled meeting. Yet when a CNN correspondent, accompanied by a camera crew, attempted to interview Vito, she said she did not have the time and ducked out the back door of an elementary school where the public appearance was being staged. An official from her department did give CNN an interview. Later that same night, Vito was arrested on a charge of public drunkenness at the Hilton Hotel in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to Harrisburg Police Chief Charles Keller. News of her arrest did not become public until late Friday. ""I deeply regret that my actions earlier this week caused embarrassment to the administration and the commonwealth,"" Vito said in a statement issued to CNN by her office. ""I take full responsibility for those actions."" ""This incident has had a profound personal effect on me,"" her statement continued. ""Today, I am entering an alcohol treatment program because it is the right thing for me to do."" According to public records, Vito earns a salary of $136,120 annually.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah will fly to the United States on Monday for treatment of a herniated spinal disc and a blood clot that is causing him back pain, the country's health minister said Sunday. ""The medical team recommended that that he leaves to the U.S. to visit a spine-specialized medical center in order to complete medical examinations and for follow-up treatment,""  Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabeeah said during an interview with Saudi state television. ""But I assure everyone that he is in a stable condition, and that he is enjoying health and well-being, and God willing, he will be back safe and sound to lead this proud nation."" Doctors performed tests on the 86-year-old monarch Friday after he complained of back pain and had more tests on Sunday, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. His doctors have advised him to rest, but he took calls from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in which the regional leaders wished him a speedy recovery, the news agency reported. Crown Prince Sultan is expected to return to Riyadh while the king is overseas, the Saudi Press Agency said. But there are also questions looming about the crown prince's health: He has lived in Morocco for much of the past year and a half after surgery for an undisclosed ailment in February 2009. The top three figures in the kingdom -- Abdullah, Sultan and Prince Nayef, the country's interior minister and second deputy prime minister -- are all sons of King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, who founded modern Saudi Arabia in 1932. But the health of senior members of the royal family is ""one of those things that is rarely discussed in the media in Saudi Arabia,"" said Christopher Boucek, a Saudi Arabia analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, . ""They're a little bit more open about this stuff, but this isn't something that's widely speculated about in the Saudi press,"" he said. Abdullah has ruled the oil-rich kingdom since 2005. But he ran most of the kingdom's affairs for a decade before that on behalf of his ailing half-brother, King Fahd. Since coming to power, he has sought to establish new rules and procedures for many Saudi institutions, giving him a reputation as a reformer in the highly conservative nation. Among his changes has been the creation of a new body to formalize rules of succession and to determine whether a monarch is healthy enough to remain in power, Boucek said. Should Abdullah die or step aside and Sultan takes the throne, that new body -- known as the Bayat Council -- would choose the next crown prince, he said. Nayef is currently seen as a successor to the crown prince, but that position is ""not exactly set in stone,"" Boucek said. Abdullah has recently passed authority over the Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, which is in Saudi Arabia, to Nayef. But he also has turned over command of the Saudi Arabian National Guard, the royal family's own security force, to his son, Prince Mitab bin Abdullah, Boucek said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- While Charlie Sheen works to ""conquer the medical issues"" in rehab and his hit sitcom is on ""production hiatus,"" a porn actress is talking about a two-day party she claims led to his collapse last week. Kacey Jordan appeared on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" Monday morning and she later tweeted ""the rest of the story"" will air on ""Nightline"" Monday evening. Sheen's lawyer Yale Galanter responded with a written statement Monday. ""It is a shame that during this time, while Mr. Sheen has sought treatment on his own, opportunistic women are trying to take advantage of his celebrity status,"" Galanter said. The actress described what she said was a nonstop party at Sheen's Los Angeles home, including a large amount of cocaine use by Sheen. ""It was all over the bathroom counter,"" Jordan said. ""You could see him like chiseling it off, putting it in there repeatedly."" Sheen proposed that she and several other porn actresses move into a mansion at his expense, Jordan said. ""He wanted us all to live in this huge house he was going to rent out and he's like, 'You can have anything you want. Anything you want, you name it. It will be done within an hour,"" Jordan told ABC. But the sex and drug allegations weren't the only revelations from Jordan. She claims Sheen wanted her to baby-sit his children. ""I think maybe the baby-sitting part was important to him, so that maybe when he was, you know, doing his drinking, you know, maybe that he didn't have to have his kids see him be like that and then have one of us girls watch them,"" Jordan said. Denise Richards, an ex-wife who shares two young daughters with Sheen, apparently saw the ABC interview. Richards posted this message on her Twitter account soon after: . ""If you caught GMA today..FYI.. No 'adult film star' will be babysitting our kids!"" Sheen voluntarily entered an undisclosed rehabilitation center for treatment Friday, Sheen representative Stan Rosenfield said. The announcement came a day after Sheen was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where Rosenfield said he was treated for severe pain related to a hernia. He checked out of the Los Angeles hospital Thursday night, he said. ""Charlie has had a hernia condition for some time,"" Rosenfield said. ""I was told by the person who made the 911 call that it was hernia-related."" Sheen's hit CBS sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" has been placed on ""production hiatus,"" CBS and Warner Bros. Television said Friday. ""We are profoundly concerned for his health and well-being, and support his decision,"" their joint statement said. It was the second emergency trip to a hospital for Sheen in three months. He spent several hours in a New York hospital in October after police responded to an early morning call about ""an emotionally disturbed person"" at the Plaza Hotel, a law enforcement source said at the time. Sheen's representative blamed an ""adverse allergic reaction"" to a medication. Sheen, the son of actor Martin Sheen, spent at least a month last year at a Malibu, California, rehab center, but it was never disclosed what he was treated for there. He was arrested in December 2009 after his wife, Brooke Mueller, told Aspen, Colorado, police that he threatened her with a knife at their holiday home. A Colorado judge allowed the actor to count his time at Promises of Malibu toward a 30-day jail sentence after he entered a guilty plea in August in that case. The plea deal reduced the charges from felony domestic violence to a misdemeanor third-degree assault count.","Kacey Jordan details what she says was actor's two-day binge .

The Spaniard looked out of sorts in the opening set but slowly returned to form as the game progressed to secure a 3-6 7-6 6-4 victory in two hours 30 minutes. After a near five week break from the game due to injury, Nadal was rusty during the opening set and lost his opening service game as Roddick opened up a 3-0 lead. Nadal struggled to recover from his slovenly start and Roddick held his serve to close out the first set 6-3 in just 49 minutes. The second set saw Nadal broken again early on but the Spaniard finally made inroads into Roddick's booming serve to square the set at 2-2. After that both players held firm on serve before Nadal took the tie break and his first set at the O2 Arena in London. The deciding set went with serve until the sixth game when a passing winner handed Nadal a precious break. Roddick ensured Nadal would have to serve for the match and he duly obliged to seal a marathon battle. Afterwards Nadal told Sky Sports: ""I started the match nervous, without rhythm. Andy is a very aggressive player and it was very difficult. He can rally from the baseline and from the net, it's very difficult to pass him. ""The atmosphere here is fantastic, I'm very happy to win. For me its a very important victory."" Novak Djokovic made an impressive start to his assault on the ATP World Tour Finals title with a straight sets victory over Tomas Berdych. The world number three, who won the season-ending tournament in Shanghai in 2008, made light work of his Czech opponent, winning 6-3 6-3 in just one hour 28 minutes. The tone was set in the very first game, when Berdych served two double faults and Djokovic sealed an important break. In front of watching soccer legend Diego Maradona -- former player and coach of Argentina -- the Serb pressed home his advantage to wrap up the opening set in 43 minutes. Djokovic then broke in the third game of the second set to kill off his opponent, who made 19 unforced errors in the match. ""I couldn't ask for a better start of the tournament,"" Djokovic said. ""I was trying to focus on my game and do the things that I planned to do tactically with my coach. I think I did well. ""You have to be really on the top of the game in order to win, because these players who are taking part in this tournament are the best players in the world. There is no easy match [or] easy opponent.""","World number one Rafael Nadal beats American Andy Roddick at the ATP World Tour Finals .

"Marjah, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Foreign and Afghan forces encountered stiff resistance Saturday as their offensive in southern Afghanistan entered its second week, and a civilian was mistakenly shot dead. ""It is moving slowly but surely. The Marines are making some headway,"" said CNN correspondent Atia Abawi, who is embedded with U.S. Marines in and around Marjah in southern Afghanistan. ""The Taliban are putting up quite a resistance."" She said the militants, who usually operate in squads of 10 to 14 fighters, don't have the weaponry and technology that the U.S. troops have, but they are able to put up a tough fight from fortified compounds and even civilian homes. ""The firefights have been going on all week long,"" Abawi said. Operation Moshtarak, aimed at ousting the Taliban from their stronghold in Helmand province, is being conducted in and around the Marjah area by predominantly American and Afghan troops. British troops and their Afghan partners have been concentrating in the Nad Ali district. Troops are working to oust the Taliban and establish Afghan control. Abawi said Marines have been creating a forward operating base ""to prove to the people of Marjah as well as to the Taliban and insurgency in the area that they're here to stay"" and hope to bring ""normalcy"" to the area. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said on Friday the battle against the Taliban remains ""difficult"" in the northeast and west of Marjah, and insurgent activity is not limited to those areas. British forces say Taliban resistance has increased in recent days, and that has slowed progress, despite strides. On Friday, British officials said more than two-thirds of the Moshtarak clearance phase is completed. But British Maj. Gen. Gordon Messenger said with that effort, ""resistance in that area has increased. We did expect the enemy to up the level of resistance, and that has happened. ""ISAF and Afghan forces are being directly targeted more now than they were before, but the enemy is still uncoordinated."" Messenger said providing extra security to key roads between Nad Ali and Lashkar Gah, Helmand's capital, are high priorities. ""Freedom of movement is vital so that locals can go about their business without fear of IEDs on the road and so we can bring key supplies into the area, and so the Afghan governors can get out to do their business,"" Messenger said. Watch why some call the operation a publicity stunt . Foreign and Afghan forces have taken pains to avoid civilian casualties in the operation. Civilian deaths and injuries during the Afghan war during airstrikes, raids and so-called ""escalation of force"" confrontations at checkpoints have undermined NATO efforts to get Afghans on their side. But despite such efforts, such casualties have occurred in Moshtarak, with the latest coming on Friday, when coalition troops shot dead a man they mistook for a militant. ISAF said the incident occurred in Nad Ali on Friday when an ISAF patrol thought he might have been carrying a bomb in a box. ""The patrol warned the individual by waving their hands, providing verbal warnings, and firing small pen flares into the air. The man dropped the box, turned and ran away from the patrol, and then for an unknown reason turned and ran toward the patrol, at which time they shot and killed him,"" ISAF said in a news release. Later, troops discovered that there was no bomb material. Troops will meet with local leaders to discuss how to avoid such incidents, and a condolence payment will be offered to the victim's family. ""This is truly a regrettable incident, and we offer our condolences to the family,"" said Navy Capt. Jane Campbell, ISAF Joint Command spokeswoman. Afghan President Hamid Karzai addressed the issue in parliament on Saturday, acknowledging efforts to improve but stressing that more has to be done. ""Regarding the civilian causalities in airstrikes and operations, the NATO and coalition forces have tried to conduct their operations carefully and responsibly to avoid civilian casualties,"" he said. ""As a result civilian casualties have decreased. Our goal is to completely avoid the civilian casualties.""","Squads of 10-14 militants engage U.S. and Afghan forces in firefights .

"(CNN) -- The future of around 2,000 Dutch soldiers serving in Afghanistan has been thrown into doubt by the collapse Saturday of the Netherlands' coalition government. Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende's office said in a statement that the Labor Party had withdrawn from the government following days of talks over whether the troops should be brought home. Balkenende's center-right Christian Democratic Alliance had hoped to keep the country's troops in Afghanistan as part of NATO's International Security and Assistance Force beyond an August deadline for their return. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen asked the Netherlands to extend its mission in Afghanistan earlier this month. The Netherlands currently has 1,950 troops serving in Afghanistan's Uruzgan province as part of NATO's International Security and Assistance Force, according to the ISAF Web site. The Dutch government extended the military mission by two years back in 2007. But the Labor Party, led by Deputy Prime Minister Wouter Bos, opposed fulfilling NATO's request to extend the mission again. Bos said that the current Afghanistan policy was not sustainable, according to the official ANP news agency. In a statement to reporters, Balkenende said there was no longer a ""fruitful path"" for the near-three-year-old coalition between the CDA, Labor and the Christian Union to go forward. He said he would meet Queen Beatrix, the country's head of state, later Saturday to offer the resignations of the 12 Labor members of his cabinet and ""make available"" the 12 cabinet positions held by his own party and three held by the Christian Union. The move is expected to trigger early general elections in the country. Balkenende has led a succession of coalitions since becoming prime minister in 2002. The CDA, Labor and Christian Union entered into a coalition agreement in February 2007 following elections in November 2006. But the three parties have disagreed on several issues including Afghanistan.","Labor Party members quit the coalition government after talks fail .

The masters degree will examine The Beatles' contribution to modern society. Liverpool Hope University, in the Fab Four's home city, says its Beatles, Popular Music and Society course will be a long-overdue examination of the band behind songs such as ""Help!"" ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,"" and ""Octopus's Garden."" ""There have been over 8,000 books about The Beatles but there has never been serious academic study and that is what we are going to address,"" says Miles Brocken, Hope's senior lecturer in popular music. ""Forty years on from their break-up, now is the right time and Liverpool is the right place to study The Beatles,"" he adds. He said the course, expected to offer places to 30 students when it starts in September 2009, had already received enquiries from overseas, including the United States. Brocken defended the course's practical use, telling the Guardian newspaper that academic study of John, Paul, George and Ringo would put its students firmly on the long and winding road to a successful career. What do you think? ""I think any MA equips people with extra study and research skills. MAs of any description are vital for the workplace,"" he said.

"Arnold Palmer, one of the greatest players in the history of golf, has exclusively told CNN that the Olympic Games could help to revive the recession-hit sport. Golfing legend Palmer believes an Olympic golf tournament would be a welcome boost for the sport. With golf being hit hard by the recent downturn in the global economy, Palmer believes the sport needs all the help it can get if it is to come out the other side of the recession. Palmer said: ""The downturn in the economy has affected many golf clubs and I hope we've reached the bottom on that. ""It is probably being felt most severely in America. I'd like to see that stop and for players to return to the golf course.  It's tough right now but I'm sure things will improve. ""Golf has changed so much from when I thurned professional. My main goal was always to increase the awareness of golf and that has happened. ""In places like India, China, Japan and  South and Central America, people are becoming avid golf fans because the climate is perfect for the game. ""Golf is now an international competition and it is bringing people in from all around the world. ""But if golf gets accepted by the Olympic Committee it would be a wonderful thing for the continuing growth of the game. Bringing people together on the course is one of the most important things we can do."" It has been over a century since golf was an official Olympic sport, with George Lyon of Canada claiming the last gold medal in 1904. Europe's 2010 Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie made a presentation to the International Olympic Committee's executive board in Lausanne on June 15 as golf tries to earn a spot in the 2016 Games. The IOC will vote on the existing 26 sports on the program -- and the inclusion of two more -- at its session in Copenhagen in October. Golf is vying with karate, squash, rugby sevens, roller sports, baseball and softball for the two spots on offer.","Legend Arnold Palmer believes that golf would benefit from being in Olympics .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A boy playing with matches started a Southern California wildfire that scorched more than 38,000 acres, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Tuesday. A firefighter talks on a radio while battling the Buckweed blaze on October 22. The Buckweed Fire, which destroyed 21 homes on its rampage, began October 21 in the Agua Dulce community. ""Our arson explosive detectives, in conjunction with the Los Angeles County Fire Department investigators, immediately began their investigation, and during the course of the investigation, it led to a juvenile suspect,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Tony Moore told CNN's ""American Morning"" Wednesday. ""After talking with that juvenile, he admitted to playing with matches, and accidentally starting the fire in that area,"" he said.   Watch what's next for young suspect » . The boy, whose name and age were not given, is home with his parents, police said. The case will be presented to the Los Angeles County district attorney for possible charges. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the Buckweed Fire burned 38,526 acres. Sixty-three structures, 21 of them homes, were destroyed, and three civilians and two firefighters were injured. The sheriff's department said the fire forced the evacuation of about 15,000 people. As of Tuesday, 18 of 23 wildfires in Southern California were completely under control, and the remainder were at least 70 percent contained, according to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fires are blamed for 14 deaths and charred more than 508,000 acres, destroying about 1,600 homes. Five people were arrested in arson probes last week, and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Saturday vowed to ""hunt down"" people responsible for setting wildfires. Authorities said Saturday they were following 1,700 tips about a white Ford F-150 pickup seen near the origin of the sprawling Santiago Fire in Orange County. Witnesses reported seeing the 1998-2004 model truck with chrome tubular running boards on Santiago Canyon Road on October 21 at about the time the Santiago Fire started. Authorities said last week they had found evidence at the scene, although they declined to describe it. ""If I were one of the people who started the fires, I would not sleep soundly right now, because we're right behind you,"" Schwarzenegger said, urging the culprits to turn themselves in.

"(CNN) -- Police opened, and then dropped, an investigation of physical abuse involving a Florida mother against her teen daughter, closing the case weeks before the woman admitted killing the girl and her brother because they were ""mouthy."" Julie K. Schenecker, 50, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of her 13-year-old son, Beau Powers Schenecker, and her 16-year-old daughter, Calyx Powers Schenecker. She was denied bond at a court appearance Monday, a court spokesman said. ""Our belief was that she didn't snap -- she planned this,"" Tampa, Florida, police spokesperson Laura McElroy told HLN's Vinnie Politan on Monday. New details emerged about the alleged murder as well as a run-in Schenecker had with police months earlier, regarding her treatment of her children. In November, police opened a child abuse investigation into allegations Schenecker had abused Calyx, according to a report from the Tampa Police. A responding officer, Julie Becker, wrote that she didn't see any ""visible injuries"" on Calyx, nor did the girl complain of any. ""She seemed cautious of what was saying, and at times began to cry,"" Becker said in her report. Calyx told police that days earlier her mother repeatedly hit her while they were driving home, before she was able to run to a safe spot in her room. The girl said that a month and a half earlier, her mother had hit her so hard in the face it caused her lip to bleed. Julie Schenecker told police she had hit the girl three times in the first incident after the girl told her, ""You're disgusting,"" and ""You're not my parent,"" according to the police report. She said Calyx was not bruised or bleeding afterward. The mother also admitted hitting the girl once more than a month earlier, according to her police statement, but she again denied that Calyx had bled. Becker noted, ""There is no prior history (related to) this location and the family."" On December 21, having found ""no evidence of a criminal offense,"" authorities ended their investigation of the case. McElroy, the Tampa police spokeswoman, said Monday that the daughter's seeming ""regret"" over her comments and the fact no wounds could be seen prompted the investigators' decision. ""Parents can discipline their children using physical force, as long as there's no injury,"" said McElroy. ""That's why there was no criminal offense at that time."" But McElroy said police determined on January 28 after they arrived at the family home that Schenecker had plotted to kill the teens. Authorities went to the house after getting a call from the suspect's mother who, after e-mail communications the previous night, was worried her daughter was depressed. Officers arrived at 7:45 a.m. to find Julie Schenecker on her home's back porch, ""a little combative"" and her clothing soaked in blood, McElroy said. Police then found Calyx's body in an upstairs bedroom. She had been shot twice in the head, police said. Beau's body was later found in the front seat of an SUV inside the home's garage, police said. They said he was shot while he was being driven to soccer practice. A preliminary investigation indicates the teens were killed Thursday night, the police statement said, but the county medical examiner will determine their time of death. Schenecker confessed to killing the children, according to a police statement, eventually recounting her rationale and thought process ""in detail,"" according to a press release. ""She did tell us that they talked back, that they were mouthy,"" McElroy told CNN affiliate WTSP late last week. ""But I don't think that will ever serve as an explanation to the rest of us of how you could take a child's life."" Schenecker had initially planned what she called the ""massacre"" -- killing the children and then herself, McElroy said on Monday -- for January 22, but she put it off after learning there would be a three-day check before she could buy a gun. Police later found writings in the house, thought to be from Schenecker, in which she spelled out her intentions in detail. ""There are definitely indications that she planned this,"" McElroy said. ""(The writing) was devoid of emotion."" Schenecker's husband, Parker, is a colonel in the U.S. Army. He is a member of U.S. Central Command and police told CNN affiliate WFTS that he was in Qatar when his children were killed. Schenecker appeared in court Monday via video link from jail, WFTS reported. She held a tissue and wept softly during the two-minute appearance. Judge Walter Heinrich said at the hearing that Schenecker likely will undergo a psychiatric evaluation, according to CNN affiliates WTSP and WFTS. She did not enter a plea because of that likelihood, according to Hillsborough County Court spokesman Calvin Green. No new court dates are set in the case, Green said. Prosecutors have 21 days to present the case to a grand jury. The mourning for the young victims continues in West Florida, where a vigil was held Friday night. On Monday -- their first day back since the shootings became public -- students at Liberty Middle School in Tampa, wore blue and black in memory of Beau, an eighth-grader at the school. ""We wanted to show him that we miss him and he didn't deserve this,"" Jae Shim, the boy's classmate and friend, told CNN affiliate WFTS. Those students had responded to postings on Facebook, where a page had been set up to honor the boy and his sister, a sophomore and cross-country standout at King High School. ""Heaven is now home to two new angels,"" read one post, from Ron Taskey. ""May you both rest in peace!"" In Session's Aletse Mellado contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- Jenson Button's opening two wins of the Formula One season will stand after motorsport chiefs ruled on Wednesday that the aerodynamic diffuser fitted to the rear of his Brawn GP car is legal. Jenson Button's victories in the opening two races of the F1  season were on the line. The FIA Court of Appeal said that the rear diffusers used by the Brawn, Williams and Toyota teams ""comply with the applicable regulations."" The FIA panel sat for eight hours in Paris on Tuesday to hear evidence and their decision backs up the stewards at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix that the controversial aerodynamic devices were within the rules. Four rival teams, led by Ferrari, had lodged an official appeal against that decision and if had been successful the results in Australia and Malaysia would have been altered to their advantage. Brawn GP chief Ross Brawn had mounted a robust defense of his position. ""We didn't consider this to be a radical new design. It was an innovative approach of an existing idea, and Formula One is all about innovative design. It's a cornerstone and objective of the sport,"" he told Press Association. In a statement released after the decision, Brawn added: . ""The FIA technical department, the stewards at the Australian and Malaysian Grands Prix and now five judges at the International Court of Appeal have confirmed our belief that our cars have always strictly complied with the 2009 technical regulations. ""The decision of the International Court of Appeal brings this matter to a conclusion and we look forward to continuing on the track the challenge of what has been a very exciting start to the 2009 FIA Formula One World Championship."" The third round of the F1 season takes place in Shanghai this weekend with other teams now having to play catch-up on the all-conquering Brawn. After a 1-2 in Australia with Button and Rubens Barrichello they lead the constuctors' championship ahead of Toyota. In the title race, Button has 15 points, five more than Barrichello. Toyota pair Jarno Trulli and Timo Glock are next . The Brawn GP team was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by Brawn and Nick Fry after Honda withdrew from Formula One at the end of 2008 due to the economic downturn. Button's victory in Melbourne capped a remarkable reversal of fortunes for the team, but the legal wrangling threatened to dampen their celebrations before Wednesday's conclusive ruling. Ferrari reacted coolly to the decision with team principal Stefano Domenicali sayng they would have to re-design their car. ""Unfortunately this decision forces us to intervene on fundamental areas of the car's design in order to be able to compete on an equal footing with some of the teams,"" he told the Press Association. ""We will now double our efforts to get the team back to the highest level of competitiveness.""","FIA Appeal decision goes in favor of Brawn GP, Toyota and Williams teams .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A Japanese volcano was erupting for a second day on Thursday, spewing smoke and ash up to 9,800 feet (3,000 meters) into the air, officials said. The smoke from the Mt. Shinmoe volcano, on the boundary between Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures, is rising and falling from the volcano crater, said the Kagoshima Meteorological Observatory. Some people in Miyazaki voluntarily evacuated Thursday morning, but all have returned home, and the government has issued no evacuation advice, according to the Miyazaki disaster prevention office. However, the alert level was raised Wednesday to 3. That prevents people from entering the mountain area. The eruption began Wednesday. Smoke was drifting southeast, the observatory said. Ash was seen in Miyakonojo city in Kagoshima prefecture. The last Mt. Shinmoe eruption was in July. A large-scale eruption such as this one, however, was last observed about 52 years ago, the meteorological observatory said.","Mt. Shinmoe's last eruption was in July .

"(CNN) -- Floyd Mayweather Jr has exclusively told CNN that his WWE and dancing talents will be put away for the time being as he prepares for his comeback fight against Juan Manuel Marquez. Floyd Mayweather Jr will fight Juan Manuel Marquez at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Saturday. The Michigan-born fighter took part in reality television show Dancing With The Stars and also made several appearances on WWE but returns to the boxing ring for the first time since December 2007 with a non-title welterweight bout against Mexican Marquez. Mayweather, who has won world titles at five different weights and is recognized as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters ever, was in typically bullish mood ahead of the bout at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. ""I loved doing Dancing With The Stars and also doing WWE but boxing is my love, something that I love do and something I enjoy doing,"" Mayweather told CNN. ""I want to come back and display my skills for all my fans. I missed being in the sport of boxing - the sport is still in me and on Saturday night I am going to be the best I can be. ""I was in the gym every day and so I thought why not get back in there and get serious again and get back into boxing."" Mayweather is confident that if he is able to box to his strengths then he will overcome Marquez who boasts a record of 50 victories, four defeats, one draw with 37 knockouts. ""Marquez is a solid opponent who is tough and he is going to be at his best and the main thing is just to be me, be focused, be smart, be sharp and go out there and execute the game plan which is to relax and be Floyd Mayweather,"" he said. ""He is going to bring his best, if he plays to the crowd then he can caught in the exchange but I know he is going to come to the fight. ""He is not one of those types of fighters that are going to come and lay down. I am going to go out there and be at my best and bring my best and give the fans all over the world their moneys worth. ""He is a guy that I cannot overlook. Just like me he came from small weight classes and won titles at every weight class and has dominated. He had a few of knockdowns in a row but he is a solid opponent and one of the best guys in the sport so I have to be Floyd Mayweather and do what I have to do."" Mayweather also played down talk of an inevitable showdown with Manny Pacquiao and insisted he concentrating on the task in hand. He added: ""My main focus is Marquez and I'm not thinking of another fighter. We take one step at a time. Negotiating opponents is for my advisors and team Mayweather. Me?

"(CNN) -- As a comedic sidekick, Brian Fantana in ""Anchorman"" was golden -- the clueless ladies' man who sex-panthered his way into fans' hearts. Paul Rudd stars as Danny Donahue in ""Role Models,"" which he helped write. Some might say the same about the man who played Fantana, Paul Rudd, although this talented actor didn't need a secret cologne for his trip to stardom. From ""Anchorman"" to ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" to ""Knocked Up,"" Rudd has consistently played a hilarious second string. But he's no longer just comedic backup in Hollywood. In his new movie ""Role Models,"" which opens November 7, Rudd and Seann William Scott star as a pair of energy drink representatives who end up with a choice: jail time or 150 community service hours in a local mentoring program. As it turns out, the jail time might have been less painful. CNN talked to Rudd about the movie -- which he helped write -- how he chooses his roles and what he was like as a child. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: What attracts you to the roles you choose? Paul Rudd: Well, you know, 99 percent of the time I just say I want to do it if I'd want to see it. A lot depends on the people that are involved and if I feel there's something I can connect with a character in some way. I kind of decided a long time ago that I was going to try to make a career work on my own terms as much as possible. I mean, you know you don't always have the options you'd like, but I just decided however long or bumpy the route was, I would do it doing things that I liked and was genuinely interested in and wanted to do.  Watch Rudd talk about ""Role Models"" » . CNN: Have there been any characters in particular that have been your favorite or you've felt you really connected with? Rudd: There have been many that I've really liked. Brian Fantana in ""Anchorman"" was a blast, just really, really fun. ""Role Models"" is the one that's coming out that was really, really enriching and fun and personal in many ways, because it's the first movie I co-wrote. I've been really lucky to have enjoyed the experiences as much as I have, working on movies, because it's not always the case. You never know how they're going to turn out, but if they actually mean something to me -- if I think there's something in it that's genuinely interesting to me -- they've, so far, turned out pretty well. CNN: Can you tell me about the process of writing ""Role Models""? Rudd: It had been around for a while in different forms, this film. I thought that the premise was really, really funny, and the script was funny, but there were certain things that were being changed. In talking with the producer, she wanted to know what was working and what wasn't working ... and I was hired to be one of the writers. So I rewrote it, and then David Wain, who is the director, he came on board, and then he and I worked on it together with another guy named Ken Marino, who is also a friend of mine. It was really fun to work with friends, and it turned into a hybrid of a movie that's unique and funny and absurd. It's a commercial film, but for people who are familiar with David Wain's style -- which is a very specific kind of left-of-center approach and not so, I think, commercially appealing -- it's a kind of a weird marriage that works well. [Wain, a member of the comedy troupe the State, directed and co-wrote ""Wet Hot American Summer.""] . It is a commercial film, but there are some jokes in it that you just don't see in commercial movies. It's got elements of a family film, but it's way darker than a family film. It's a hard R, bizarre family adventure. I don't know how exactly to describe it. CNN: I have to ask, what was it like working with ""McLovin"" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse from ""Superbad""), who plays your mentor child in the movie? Rudd: It was pretty great. That kid is seriously smart and funny. It blows my mind how much his life changed in the course of a couple years. We didn't necessarily write that part for Chris. I imagined that role to be younger, but he's so good and kind of so perfect for it. And he liked it and was into the idea of doing it, so that's how that happened. CNN: Is he as geeky in real life? Rudd: No, the thing is, this is why he's so good; this is what impressed me about him. He knows what he's doing. Michael Cera is like this, too. I'm shocked at the kind of self-awareness of these kids, and they're 18 and really talented. [They] know how to deliver a joke and don't ham it up. CNN: This movie is all about role models, and as an actor, you are a role model to many people. What do you think the most important qualities of a role model are? Rudd: To be an actual role model? Oh, God, I would hesitate to say we should be anybody's role models. Your role models are your parents. But, I always think a good rule of thumb is to treat people the way you'd like to be treated; let the rest take care of itself. You know, try to be nice to people, I suppose, and to treat people with respect and be polite. But I haven't figured out nearly enough stuff to be an effective role model. CNN: Do you have any personal role models? Rudd: You know who's a good role model? Paul Newman. I just think he's an example of somebody who came into this world, and left this world, as a contributor in ways that are so huge.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Two titans of showbusiness have come together in a perfect pairing: The Rolling Stones, the world's greatest band, play two nights at New York's intimate Beacon Theatre; capturing the night on camera is celebrated film director, Martin Scorsese. Shared history, mutual respect: The Stones and Scorsese . The result is ""Shine a Light,"" which records Jagger, Richards, Watts and Wood's performance at the end of ""Bigger Bang,"" their monumental two-year, record-breaking, $558 million, 144-date global tour that saw 4.6 million ticket holders watch the rock giants. The Stones/Scorsese combo is backed by a team of Oscar-winning cinematographers, more than 18 cameras, duets with the White Stripes' Jack White, pop starlet Christina Aguilera and blues granddaddy Buddy Guy, plus a cameo from a former U.S. president: the Stones juggernaut is well and truly in town. Scorsese is no stranger to the world of rock music. He cut his teeth as an editor on seminal 1970 documentary ""Woodstock"" and aside from making some of the silver screen's finest movies (""Goodfellas,"" ""Mean Streets,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""The Departed""), he is also the master behind definitive rockumentaries ""The Last Waltz,"" which captured The Band's final performance, and Bob Dylan epic, ""No Direction Home."" But apart from his musical collaborations, rock has underpinned many of the master's greatest moments -- and his relationship with the Stones goes way back. The Stones themselves have provided the backing track for classic Scorsese scenes: notably, Jack Nicholson's Irish mobster's entrance in ""The Departed"" to the thumping sound of ""Gimme Shelter"" and ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" behind De Niro's introduction in ""Mean Streets""; while ""Goodfellas"" features ""Monkey Man"" and, again, ""Gimme Shelter."" Scorsese, who pioneered the use of rock music on ""Mean Streets,"" has said that his use of eclectic soundtracks stems from New York, where all genres of music would blast from the brownstones around his neighborhood. And for him, the Stones provide the sound of the city, the sound of the streets: cool, dangerous, absolutely self-assured, suffused with menace and gangster swagger. He says, ""The Stones were key ... I was creating scenarios in my head as I listened to their music."" ""There is a drive and an authority to their music, and also an edge to it,"" he continues. ""I've used Gimme Shelter twice now in my pictures."" (It's left to Jagger to joke that Shine a Light is the first Scorsese film not to feature the track.) So when Jagger decided he wanted a film of their live performance, who better to call. ""It's good to start at the top,"" he says. Initially, guitarist Keith Richards was reluctant to go ahead with the film. He told CNN, ""I wouldn't have done this. They said, 'We wanna shoot a show,' and I said, 'Yeah, so?'"" But Richards, a film buff and longtime fan of Scorsese's work, couldn't resist the chance to be shot by the director. ""You go, whoah,"" he said. ""You can't f*** around with him. I wanted to see what Marty saw in the Stones."" And Scorsese's response? One word: ""Absolutely."" But Jagger's idea for the movie centered around the Stones' biggest ever concert, in Rio de Janeiro. Scorsese wasn't convinced that the Brazilian beach extravaganza would hit the right note . ""I wanted to capture the music and their interaction on stage, I wanted people to feel like they were with them in the real film,"" he explains. Eventually he persuaded Jagger to forego the Rio beach gig for a double date at New York's Beacon Theatre. On the night of the performance, we see Scorsese's painstaking preparation come up against the monster of spontaneity that is the Rolling Stones live. As the clock ticks towards curtain time, the filmmaker still doesn't have the final set-list, and is getting jittery. ""It felt like the last minute. It may actually have been an hour or so,"" he recalls. But as the song goes, you can't always get what you want: Scorsese had to place his faith in his meticulous planning, and the hope that he would be able to respond to the performers -- Jagger especially -- on the night. Scorsese believes that the band's live performances are the key to their long-lived success. ""The way they work off of each other and off of the audience ... It's fascinating to see that kind of power,"" he explains. ""They cast a spell, something primal but very orchestrated."" When it came to the edit, Scorsese ditched any thought of talking-head interviews, choosing instead to splice vintage TV/archive footage between the live shots. That puts the focus firmly on the music, while underlining the Stones' longevity. So where does ""Shine a Light"" stand in relation to other rockumentary greats? Sure enough, it's not The Stones: The Spectacle, Mick Jagger's original concept. This is an intimate and illuminating look at the relationships in rock 'n' roll's greatest band. It pays tribute to their longevity, highlights their rich repertoire and shows how, forty years on, their live shows still crackle with energy. And while fans will decide whether Scorsese has fulfilled his aim to make ""something that's as close as possible to a live performance,"" Keith Richards believes Scorsese got the gold. ""He captured what we do,"" he told CNN. ""We are what we are. We're a rock 'n' roll band.""","The Rolling Stones and Martin Scorsese team up for ""Shine A Light""

"MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN) -- Fresh fighting between Ethiopian-backed government forces and Islamic insurgents in Somalia's capital city of Mogadishu reportedly killed at least 10 people Sunday, eyewitnesses said. A man walks past the rubble of a building destroyed in Sunday's fighting . The two sides pounded each other with artillery, sending children scurrying and bringing business at the city's main market to a standstill. ""The fighting is so heavy and a barrage of mortar bombs is hitting many parts in Bakara market, killing people and causing heavy damages of buildings "" said Ali Abdulkadir, a cloth trader at the city's main Bakara Market. Hawo Abdi Oman, another eyewitness at the market, said a shell landed in an area crowded with people, killing nine civilians. Among the dead, she said, were two children and four women. The market, a rebel stronghold, has been the site of numerous clashes since early last year. In a nearby neighborhood, Geed Jaceyl, a shell landed on a house, crushing it. A woman who was inside was killed, witnesses said. A second shell landed near a religious school, sending children running for cover. No one was injured in that incident. The presence of Ethiopian troops trying to help defend a transitional government's hold on Mogadishu has united Islamic militant groups seeking to gain control of the city. In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union -- a militia group -- ousted Somalia's transitional government from power. But the ICU was deposed in December of that year following Ethiopia's military invasion. Since then, insurgent groups have been trying to destabilize the government. Somalia's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital, with the help of the better-equipped Ethiopian forces. The violence has displaced more than 40,000 civilians who have taken shelter in dozens of makeshift settlements west of Mogadishu. Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. Sunday's fighting came a day after suspected insurgents killed a local reporter, who freelanced for the BBC and Reuters news agency. The national union of journalists in Somalia called the death of Nasteh Dahir Farah a ""targeted assassination."" He was the 10th reporter killed in the war-torn nation since last year. Farah, 36, was gunned down on his way home from work in the southern city of Kismayu, according to the National Union of Somali Journalists. -- Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report .","Fighting between government forces and insurgents in Mogadishu kills at least 10 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A blossoming of cinematic creativity has swept Argentina in recent years, bringing about a second golden age of film. Pablo Trapero's latest movie ""Lion's Den"" stars Martina Gusman (left) and was in competition at Cannes. In Argentina, the renaissance marks a return to form for a cinematic tradition that was prolific and highly successful until creativity was stifled by a succession of military regimes that began with the ascendancy of Juan Peron in the 1940s. A revival occurred after the country returned to democracy in 1983 as filmmakers focused on life under the military dictatorship -- Luiz Puenzo's ""The Official Story"" (1985) won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. But an economic malaise ensued, turning off the taps to film financing. An economic boom in the 1990s quickly turned unstable, resulting in a crippling financial crisis earlier this decade that plunged Argentina into its worst recession ever. Out of the chaos, a new group of Argentina filmmakers emerged. The leaders of the so-called ""New Argentine Cinema"" have become critical contributors to the wider Latin American film movement that has captivated international critics and audiences alike. What's fueling New Argentine Cinema? Argentina's economy has recovered remarkably since its collapse in 2001, and the national film institute, Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales (INCAA), has been keen to foster the industry's development. The combination of cheap production costs and a flourishing artistic community has made Buenos Aires a hub of creativity. Already one of the most cosmopolitan cities in South America, the city is attracting everyone from local bohemians to big Hollywood names. Francis Ford Coppola, the most recent notable to tap into the vibrant scene, opened an Argentine unit of his Zoetrope production company last year to film his Buenos Aires-set family drama ""Tetro,"" which is anticipated to be released next year. What movies are creating buzz? Pablo Trapero's ""Lion's Den"" about a woman who gives birth and raises her child in prison was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year. Trapero is best known for his depiction of ordinary people. He gained acclaim with ""Crane World"" (1999) -- a gritty look at Argentina's working class -- and is widely considered one of Argentina's leading directors. Also in competition at Cannes this year was ""The Headless Woman"" from the ever subtle Lucrecia Martel. The film focuses on a woman's guilt after a hit-and-run accident and like Martel's other works, offers up a dose of social criticism. Martel burst on the scene with her first movie ""The Swamp"" (2001), winner of the Alfred Bauer Award at the Berlin International Film Festival. Lucia Puenzo stirred debate with ""XXY"" (2007), an exploration of adolescent sexuality centered around the life of a teenage hermaphrodite. The daughter of award-winning Luiz Puenzo, Lucia took home the Critic Weeks Grand Prize at Cannes last year. Are you excited about Argentine cinema? What is your favorite movie or director? Enough with the dramas -- who makes Argentines laugh? Daniel Burman has cited Woody Allen as one of the auteurs he most admires, and the influence is quite clear in his work, in which his identity as a Jew in Argentina figures prominently. ""Waiting for the Messiah"" (2000), ""Lost Embrace"" (2004) and ""Family Law"" (2006) make up the trilogy of films about fatherhood for which he has gained praise. The young director's latest film ""Empty Nest"" (2008) takes a touching and comedic look at married life. What's this I hear about a Hollywood in Argentina? You're referring to Palermo Hollywood. No, it's not a Las Vegas casino but rather a neighborhood in Buenos Aires where many film and TV studios are based. A bohemian spirit distinguishes the neighborhood from its more polished cousin to the south, Palermo Soho. Once occupied by desolate factories and warehouses, the area is now humming with activity. An abundance of hip lounges, cafes and trendy restaurants keep the buzz going all day and through the night. How does Argentina figure in the Latin American film scene? As the Latin American film renaissance has gained stride, filmmakers across the region have become more interested in collaborating on projects. The end of military dictatorships which ruled Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s ""created really interesting national cinemas that blossomed a little bit everywhere but also created a correlation between directors from different countries,"" Brazilian director Walter Salles told CNN earlier this year. Salles works frequently with Argentine directors. He co-produced Trapero's ""Lion's Den"" and Julia Solomonoff's ""Sisters"" (2005). Meanwhile, Eduardo Constantini Jr, of the philanthropic Constantini family in Argentina, recently launched a fund with the Weinstein Co. aimed at backing Latin American movies. He is also behind The Auteurs, an ""online movie theater"" where Web users can watch and discuss film. Is this boom going to run out of steam? The renaissance in Argentina has been building for some time, but it's only just hitting its stride now. Earlier films were mainly art house successes but now with the spotlight shining on Latin America cinema, Argentine films may start to connect more with international audiences. The country continues to attract productions, and there is a vast pool of talent that is being groomed to lead the next generation of auteurs. More than 12,000 undergraduates are currently studying film directing, scriptwriting and technical production, according to the INCAA. Five other must-see Argentine films . 1. ""The Night of the Pencils"" (Hector Olivera, 1986) 2. ""Nine Queens"" (Fabian Bielinsky, 2000) 3. ""Son of the Bride"" (Juan Jose Campanella, 2001) 4. ""The Dog"" (Carlos Sorin, 2004) 5.

"(CNN) -- Ingrid Betancourt has been reunited with her children for the first time in six years since her abduction by FARC rebels in Colombia. Ingrid Betancourt, center, with her daughter Melanie and son Lorenzo. Betancourt, 46, who was rescued Wednesday in a daring operation by the Colombian Army, met with her daughter, Melanie Delloye, and son, Lorenzo Delloye-Betancourt, on the steps of a plane that had just arrived from France at a Colombian airport. The three tearfully clung together, hugging and kissing each other fervently before disappearing inside the plane. ""They look so different, but they look so much the same at the same time; they are so beautiful,"" Betancourt told reporters. ""The last time I saw my children, Lorenzo was very small ... I could lift him up, he looked like my nephew who is right here,"" Betancourt said later, as she stood between her children, both now taller than she. There are ""many dreams I want to share with them ... I have so many things that I want to say to them,"" she added. Her children, now adults, were accompanied on the plane by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. Betancourt, a dual French national who grew up in Paris, is a cause celebre across Europe, where scores of cities had adopted her since her abduction in February 2002. She will travel to Paris Thursday night, said Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos. Her release dominated the pages and broadcasts of French newspapers, Web sites and television stations. French President Nicolas Sarkozy had made her rescue a priority and in a televised address after her release expressed his happiness and thanks to the Colombian government, while urging FARC members to ""stop this absurd combat, this fight."" ""There were a lot of deceptions, but they always believed and they always had confidence,"" Sarkozy said. ""There is always a small glimmer of hope and today the joy is huge.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- One of Osama bin Laden's sons has left Spain after he was denied asylum in the country, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman told CNN Saturday. Omar bin Laden pictured earlier this year during a television interview in Rome, Italy. Omar bin Laden left Madrid Saturday afternoon en route to Cairo, Egypt, she said. The ministry did not divulge why his request was denied. Spain's decision came after bin Laden appealed the country's initial decision Wednesday to deny him asylum. The man, who is married to a British citizen, previously was denied asylum in Britain. He holds a Saudi passport. Bin Laden, who is in his late 20s, stepped off a plane from Cairo at Madrid's Barajas International Airport during a stopover late Monday and informed authorities that he planned to request asylum, the spokeswoman said. He was taken to a secure area of the airport for asylum seekers while his request was processed. He prepared his formal asylum request Tuesday at the airport with the help of a translator, the spokeswoman said. It was not known on what grounds bin Laden based his request. He has publicly called on his father -- who is the leader of al Qaeda and the world's most-wanted man -- to abandon terrorism. Last year, 7,664 people requested asylum in Spain. The government granted that status to only 570, the spokeswoman said.","Osama bin Laden's son leaves Spain after he was denied asylum .

(CNN) -- Bayer Leverkusen moved within eight points of German Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund after a 2-0 victory over Hannover. First half goals from Arturo Vidal and Simon Rolfes settled the outcome and saw Leverkusen go five points clear of Hannover who sit third. But Dortmund can extend the gap at the top to 11 points if they win at Wolfsburg on Saturday. The home side nearly fell behind inside two minutes when Norwegian striker Mohamed Abdellaoui was denied by Leverkusen keeper Rene Adler. But after that early scare Leverkusen took control of the match and Vidal put them in front on 21 minutes. The Chilean midfielder  pounced on a loose ball on the edge of the penalty area after Hannover failed to clear from Stefan Kiessling's blocked shot and his volley flew into the net. German international and former Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack should have doubled Leverkusen's advantage moments later but he headed wide of the target. Adler was called upon to preserve the home side's lead after a rare breakaway from Hannover as Lars Stindi capitalized on former Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia's mistake but his shot was right at the keeper. But just before the interval Rolfes made it 2-0. He collected Gonzalo Castro's pass and curled his effort into the net.

"(CNN)  -- Borussia Dortmund opened up a massive 10-point lead in the German Bundesliga with a 2-0 win at Nuremberg on Sunday, their 13th win from 15 games. It gives Dortmund an excellent chance of claiming their first title in nine years, particularly with defending champions Bayern Munich struggling in seventh spot, fully 17 points behind the pacesetters. Dortmund made light of a snow blizzard and a hard pitch as goals either side of halftime by Germany defender Mats Hummels and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski were enough for a comfortable victory. It leaves them on 40 points with second-placed Mainz on 30 points. Mainz lost 2-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Coach Jurgen Klopp is trying to keep his young team grounded despite their big lead. ""I have never been able to, or even had to, consider the fight for the championship, so I don't think it is relevant with so much of the season left to play,"" he told AFP. ""It is more important we keep playing well. Every game is like a final for us, the next game is always the most important for me."" But even Bayern coach Louis van Gaal has all but conceded the championship. ""Lots might still happen but I think (Dortmund) are too far ahead,"" van Gaal told AFP after his side's disappointing 2-0 defeat at Schalke 04 on Saturday. Bayer Leverkusen stay third after a 3-2 win over Cologne earlier Sunday to take them to 29 points. Goals by Patrick Helmes, Swiss midfielder Tranquillo Barnetta and defender Stefan Reinartz sealed the win which leaves them just a point behind Mainz, who lost 2-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. With two rounds to go before the midwinter break, Leverkusen will welcome the return of Germany star Michael Ballack from injury when the Bundesliga resumes in January.

"(CNN) -- An Indiana judge Monday froze the assets of Marcus Schrenker, a suburban Indianapolis financial manager who authorities say tried to fake his own death by crashing his private plane into a Florida swamp. Marcus Schrenker exited his small plane before it crashed, and investigators are looking for him, police say. Investigators looking into his business dealings for possible securities violations requested the temporary restraining order in Hamilton County Superior Court, said Jim Gavin, spokesman for the Indiana Secretary of State. He said the order, which also applies to Schrenker's wife, Michelle, and to his three companies, is aimed at protecting investors, and is related to a receivership filing. He didn't elaborate. Heritage Wealth Management, Heritage Insurance Services and Icon Wealth Management are ""the subjects of an active investigation by the Indiana Securities Division,"" Gavin said. Public documents list Schrenker as president of Heritage Wealth Management in Fishers, Indiana. A search warrant related to the inquiry was served December 31, Gavin said. According to The Herald Bulletin in Anderson, Indiana, Michelle Schrenker filed for divorce in Hamilton Superior Court on December 30. A hearing was set for February 5. Schrenker, 38, took off alone Sunday night in a corporate plane, a Piper PA-46, from Anderson, Indiana, en route to Destin, Florida. Authorities said the Fisher, Indiana, businessman parachuted to the ground before letting the plane crash in the Florida panhandle. The craft came down near the Blackwater River, only 50 to 75 yards from homes, said Sgt. Scott Haines of the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office.  Watch more about the mysterious flight » . ""It is a neighborhood -- some very nice waterfront property,"" he said. Military aircraft from Whiting Field, which were dispatched to intercept the plane after Schrenker reported an emergency, witnessed the crash about 9:15 p.m. CT. The crews fired flares and noticed the plane's door was open and the cockpit was dark, Haines said in a news release. They got no response. Haines said the plane appeared to have been put on autopilot at around 2,000 feet, over the Birmingham, Alabama, area, before the pilot parachuted to the ground. Schrenker had contacted air traffic controllers, saying that the windshield imploded. ""The pilot stated that he was bleeding profusely,"" the news release said. ""Radio contact with the plane was not able to be established after that point. When deputies located the plane at the crash site, no blood was present and the door to the plane was open."" The Childersburg, Alabama, Police Department reported that Schrenker approached one of its officers shortly before 2:30 a.m., ""and said that he had been in a canoeing accident with some friends,"" a news release said. Childersburg is about 35 miles southeast of Birmingham. Childersburg officers, unaware of the plane crash, took Schrenker to a hotel in nearby Harpersville. After hearing about the crash, they went back to the hotel, where they found that Schrenker had checked into the hotel under a fictitious name. ""When authorities entered Schrenker's room, he was not there,"" the release said. Authorities said Schrenker checked in under a fake name, put on a black cap and fled into a wooded area. Hotel manager Yogi Patel, who identified Schrenker on surveillance video, told CNN that Schrenker was the only guest overnight. He signed in as Jason Galouzs of Bolingbrook, Illinois, Patel said. A hotel employee said Schrenker went up to his room, but didn't enter before leaving the building. iReport.com: Are you near the crash site? Tell us about it . Steve Darlington, manager of Anderson Municipal Airport, told CNN the plane was in fine condition at takeoff, and said Schrenker is ""an accomplished pilot"" who owns ""a couple of airplanes"" and flies regularly. No agency has come forward to lead the probe. ""The FBI is looking into the matter, along with other agencies,"" said Paul Draymond, of the Birmingham FBI office. Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said several factors indicated the pilot likely left the plane before the crash: a ""detailed review of radar data,"" the fact that the plane was switched to autopilot before it crashed, the sighting by military jet crews and the fact that the cockpit was found mostly intact with no one inside. After the pilot alerted air traffic controllers about the alleged problems with his plane, authorities tried to persuade him to land in Pell City, Alabama, east of Birmingham, Haines said. Schrenker also flew an acrobatic plane, and made a video featured on a YouTube site. A message preceding the video warns, ""No pilot should attempt this stunt. You will get yourself killed. Pilot specially trained to fly unlimited acrobatics and shows."" CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","Authorities say pilot tried to fake his own death by crashing his private plane .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- China executed at least 470 people last year -- more than any other country in the world, according to an annual report on the death penalty by the human rights group Amnesty International. A woman is shown being taken to her execution in Beijing, China, in 2001. The group said that five countries carried out 88 percent of all known executions worldwide: China (470 people), Iran (317), Saudi Arabia (143), Pakistan (135) and the United States (42). Exact figures for how many people were put to death in China are difficult to come by because the country considers the death penalty a ""state secret,"" Amnesty said. ""As the world and Olympic guests are left guessing, only the Chinese authorities know exactly how many people have been killed with state authorization,"" the group said. Last year, China reformed the way capital cases are handled, with the Supreme Court deciding all cases. This led to a drop in the number of executions, with ""half of the cases changed to a reprieve in the end,"" according to an article last week in China's state-run news agency, Xinhua. In December, the United Nations General Assembly called for a global end to the death penalty. But for now, the Amnesty report said, many countries continued to execute people for offenses that trigger much less severe sentences in other countries. In Iran, for example, a father of two was stoned to death for adultery. An Egyptian national was beheaded in Saudi Arabia for practicing sorcery. And a factory manager in North Korea was shot by a firing squad because he appointed his children as managers and made international phone calls.

Three-time major winner Padraig Harrington has broken the mould after experimenting with a devastating ice-hockey swing as used in the cult U.S. comedy sports film Happy Gilmore. The film's plot centers of the fortunes of failed ice-hockey player Happy Gilmore, played by Adam Sandler, who masters a powerful and dangerous slap shot which he converts to golf with devastating effect. The result is that Gilmore is able to whack a golf ball over 400 yards, and now Irishman Harrington has copied Gilmore's breathtaking run-and-smash technique - and amazingly has added an extra 30 yards to his drive! But is the spectacular swing legal? The Royal and Ancient (R&A), who along with the United States Golf Association (USGA), produce and revise the rules of golf, can see no problems with the method. A spokesperson at the rules department of the R&A told CNN: ""There is nothing in the rules as such to prevent the swing as performed in the film Happy Gilmore from being used by golfers. You do not have to be standing still over the ball when playing a shot, so striking the ball with a run-up is okay. ""The major concern we do have is regarding the whether it fits in with the etiquette of the game as defined in the rules. Players must have respect for the course itself and perhaps this shot lends itself to increased likelihood of damage to the course."" While Harrington may not necessarily be ready to unleash the eye-catching swing when he goes in search of his third consecutive British Open Championship title at Turnberry, Scotland next month, the technique may still have a place in the game. Dr Mark Smith, who is part of the Golf Education and Research Group at the University of Lincoln, England, believes that, with development, the swing could become part of the range of shots used by the modern golfer. ""Golfers are always looking for ways to improve their game which might give them an edge on their rivals so it wouldn't surprise me if some professionals start to experiment with the swing used by Happy Gilmore,"" Smith told CNN. ""One of the obvious benefits of the swing is that it allows you to generate more power and subsequently more distance on the shot as Padraig Harrington has shown. ""Certainly the scientific principles behind the swing and the technology used are credible as well, although golf is just as much about accuracy as power."" Dr Smith does have some reservations about the possible risk of injury with the swing -- particularly if it is not executed properly. ""The main drawback of the 'Happy Gilmore technique' from a physiological point of view is that it does place much more stress on the spine, lower back and the shoulders,"" he added. ""Therefore the likelihood of injury is increased so certainly I would be cautious of amateur players rushing down to their local club and trying to copy him thinking it might drastically improve their game. ""Perhaps a player might use when he feels has nothing to lose in a match, but when it comes to pressure situations players tend to fall back on tried and trusted methods."" Certainly Harrington's use of the 'Happy Gilmore technique' has got golf talking, but perhaps a copy of the film will not be found on the shelves next to coaching manuals just yet.","Padraig Harrington experiments with swing used in movie Happy Gilmore .

"LONDON, England -- Steve Forbes has fired Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s uncle ahead of his May 3 clash with Oscar de la Hoya -- and replaced him as trainer with another member of the flamboyant World Boxing Council welterweight champion's family. Floyd Mayweather Jr. was furious that his uncle was training his former sparring partner Steve Forbes. Mayweather was furious that his father Roger was training Forbes for a fight which could scupper his own hopes of a lucrative rematch with De La Hoya, who he beat by a split decision last May in the richest fight in boxing history. Forbes moved quickly to hire Jeff Mayweather, Roger's younger brother, after hearing Floyd air his grievances in the media. ""I asked Roger not to train Forbes,"" Mayweather said during a conference call to promote his foray into wrestling at WWE's Wrestlemania 24 on March 30. ""I'm upset with my Uncle Roger. I disapprove of Roger. If he continues to train Forbes, I have to get another trainer. ""It's taking money out of my pocket. I told him on numerous occasions not to train Steve Forbes and he's training him at my gym. ""He's taking money out his own mouth. Forbes is making $1 million, so he's jeopardizing (the trainer's share of) $80,000 for millions. I could get him that a ton of times over again. Hopefully it will be worth it."" Forbes had been working with Mayweather for only three weeks. ""I thought it was funny. Trainers should be able to train anyone they want. But it didn't really surprise me. I just wondered why it didn't happen three or four weeks ago when my fight with Oscar was announced."" ""Steve's a pro, and it doesn't bother him,"" Jeff Wald, Forbes' promoter, told The Associated Press. ""He respects the Mayweather family, and he's trained with all three brothers, so it's not going to be a problem."" Forbes has previously been trained by Roger, Jeff and Floyd Mayweather Sr, who has been estranged from his world champion son for years, and sparred with Mayweather Jr. ""It's more (a problem) with Floyd because he is Roger's boss. He pays him a nice salary,"" Forbes said. ""I'm not upset with Roger. This is just another little story to my story. It doesn't affect me one bit. But it's just bizarre."" Floyd Sr. has trained De la Hoya for all of his recent fights -- except the bout against his son last year -- but has said he might cross that line for the rematch. ""I may have to pay my dad more than Oscar is paying him,"" Floyd Jr. said. The 31-year-old Mayweather, considered pound for pound the best boxer in the world, has not fought since knocking out Britain's previously unbeaten Ricky Hatton in Las Vegas in December.

"(Wired) -- Few games live up to 11 years of anticipation, but ""StarCraft II's"" slick upgrades mean the sequel's got a shot. At midnight July 27, Blizzard switched on the servers for ""StarCraft II: Wings of LIberty."" The original ""StarCraft,"" released in 1998, became an overnight success, selling 1.5 million copies in its first year on the way to more than 11 million copies sold in its lifetime. A decade on, the sci-fi game -- which pits human Terrans against alien Zerg and Protoss races in a real-time strategy war that spans the galaxy -- is still revered for its precise balance and easy-to-learn, hard-to-master game mechanics. ""StarCraft"" became especially popular in South Korea, where professional players can earn upward of $100,000 a year and expert matches get televised nationwide. At first glance, it seems Blizzard has taken an if-it-ain't-broke approach to ""StarCraft II's"" gameplay. The biggest improvements to the single-player campaign have been in the presentation. In the original game, you were simply flung from one mission to the next with nothing but a short mission briefing, or perhaps a brief cinematic scene once in a blue moon. In the sequel, you spend your downtime hanging out inside the spaceship owned by series protagonist Jim Raynor. Inside Raynor's ship, you can spend the money you make from missions on upgrades for your army. Many upgrades consist of simple stat enhancements, but some unlock new abilities for your units. It's a fun way of introducing RPG elements that provides a tangible feeling of progression. Another change from the original ""StarCraft"": You can now choose the order in which you tackle certain missions. It's not as if you have complete freedom: You will usually be presented with two missions to choose from. This means the game follows a branching storyline of sorts, although so far I have always been able to go back and complete missions I skipped. Optional objectives within the missions themselves range from rescuing oppressed villagers to collecting a number of doodads strewn across the map. This idea is very similar to Blizzard's 2002 game ""Warcraft III"" (the last real-time strategy game the company released). The rewards are usually worth the trouble. If you rescue hapless villagers, they'll join your ranks. If you collect doodads, you'll be given more money with which to upgrade your units. Eleven years of technological progress means ""StarCraft II's"" storytelling methods aren't as primitive as they were in 1998. The first ""StarCraft"" employed mid-mission dialogue, but the animation was limited to a few pictures of talking heads. ""StarCraft II,"" on the other hand, benefits from the fully rendered cinematic scenes we've come to expect of modern gaming. These scenes are excellent: The facial expressions, character movement, sound direction and art design all come together to make a gripping plot, at least from what I've seen so far. It helps that Blizzard boasts some of the best artists in the business. ""StarCraft II"" might be somewhat low-tech compared to graphics juggernauts like Crysis or Metro 2033, but because of its excellent art direction, it is arguably more visually appealing than either of those games. ""StarCraft II"" uses a wide range of colors, and the attention to detail on things like marines' mechanized moving parts or the fluorescent glow of laser beams is spectacular as well. I haven't yet played ""StarCraft II's"" final multiplayer mode, but I did play a great deal of the multiplayer beta and came away impressed. Blizzard's overhaul of its classic Battle.net service is geared toward helping strategy newbies become competent, offering an array of challenges designed to teach important multiplayer skills. ""StarCraft II"" is a long time coming, and with fans currently caught in the throes of launch ecstasy, it's still too early to tell if it will ultimately prove to be worth the wait. But based on my first impressions, it would have to screw up pretty hard to not be. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- A rash of inclement weather shut down Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Tuesday morning, raising questions as to whether Super Bowl fans will face travel problems ahead of Sunday's big game. Icy road conditions on Tuesday forced schools and some government offices to close, while 60 municipal trucks salted and scraped their way through Dallas, Texas, said mayoral spokesman Frank Librio. But forecasters expect the blustery winter weather to leave the region -- and much of the country -- by Thursday, just as the first wave of pigskin enthusiasts are due to arrive. ""We have been planning for this for a whole year,"" Librio said of Sunday's match-up between the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers. ""We'll be ready."" Both teams and their fans are cold weather clubs, accustomed to the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. iReport: Planning for a Super Bowl road trip? But as a massive winter storm sweeps across the nation's heartland, up to 500 Dallas flights are expected to be canceled, said airport spokesman David Magana, making re-bookings difficult for those with early travel plans. With more than 30 states under winter storm warnings or blizzard warnings, air traffic came to a halt in some places. Dallas and Houston in Texas and Chicago, Illinois, are feeling the most impact, said FAA spokeswoman Tammy Jones. Transport personnel had reopened one runway at Dallas-Fort Worth airport by Tuesday afternoon, authorities said. Meanwhile, Dallas Love Field Airport was down to one open runway, according to the FAA. Forecasters say the sub-freezing temperatures will let up Friday, reaching highs of 42 degrees. But Super Bowl XLV, scheduled to begin Sunday at 6:30pm ET, is expected to draw thousands of fans to the Texan gridiron in search of warmer weather. Forecasters say Dallas temperatures will bump up to a high of 61 degrees by game day. While not exactly balmy conditions, the warm weather Super Bowl tradition could more abruptly end three years from now. The New Meadowlands Stadium, co-owned by the New York Giants and Jets, won the bid to host Super Bowl XLVIII in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Fans may be forced to don winter gloves underneath their foam fingers in what could be the nation's first true cold-weather classic in 2014. The big game is customarily played in either domed stadiums or warm weather states. The 1967 ""Ice-Bowl,"" in which the Packers edged out a 21-17 win over the Dallas Cowboys, was played in frigid temperatures at Lambeau Field in the 35th National Football League championship game. Green Bay then traveled to Los Angeles to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs 35-10 in the very first Super Bowl.","Icy weather in Dallas is raising questions over whether Super Bowl fans will face travel problems .

"London, Engand (CNN) -- The experience of minority and coalition governments worldwide shows the advantages and risks for the UK as the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties build an alliance that can command a parliamentary majority following an election that produced no clear winner. Some people in Britain, including Conservative leader David Cameron, had feared that a hung parliament would leave the country with a government too weak to be able to cut its massive deficit, potentially sparking panic on financial markets. Cameron's party have been most vocal on the need to slash public spending quickly to help reduce the deficit, while Labour strategists argue huge cuts in spending over a short period would slow recovery. William Hague, the new foreign secretary, told reporters after the weekend talks with the Lib Dems that ""the central part of any agreement will be economic stability and a reduction of the budget deficit."" But many countries where voting systems regularly produce minority or coalition governments seem to manage their economies perfectly adequately. And some calmer Westminster and City voices have pointed out that Britain managed to run its affairs during World War II with a coalition government. Germany, Europe's largest economy, is perhaps the best example of a country with a long tradition of stable coalition administrations. Chancellor Angela Merkel currently leads a coalition between the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) -- though this has come under strain recently as a result of Merkel's support for a huge financial rescue plan for Greece. Grand coalitions between the two largest parties also occur, but these are relatively rare. Discussions between parties often take place prior to an election because of a general acceptance that no one party is capable of an outright majority. This is seen as a key factor in helping to make a coalition stable. Coalition and minority governments are also the norm in much of Scandinavia where elections nearly always result in protracted discussions between two or more parties over the composition of the next government. Canada has had a Conservative minority government led by PM Stephen Harper since 2006, and is opposed by center-left Liberals and left-wing New Democrats. Harper's Conservative Party was formed following a merger of the center-right Progressive Conservative and right-wing Canadian Alliance parties. In a 2008 election, he increased his party's representation but must still govern as a minority administration, with just 143 out of 308 seats. In Ireland, no single party has ruled since 1989. Coalitions are typically formed by one of the two biggest parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and one or more of the smaller parties. The current ruling alliance between Brian Cowen's Fianna Fáil and the Greens has endured despite the country's ailing economy. Belgium's experience has been less positive. Its political system is organized around the need to represent the main cultural communities: Flemish or Dutch-speaking Flanders in the north, French-speaking Wallonia in the south and the German-speaking cantons in the east. This has often resulted in a weak coalition government, with a number of parties vying for control. Last month Prime Minister Yves Leterme was forced to resign after a Flemish liberal party withdrew from the five-party coalition government after a dispute over electoral boundaries around the nation's capital, Brussels. Bizarrely Brussels is the only electoral district where votes are not cast purely on linguistic lines. Belgium's political system insists that you can't vote for a French-speaking party in Flanders and vice versa. Italy also has a history of fractious coalitions, with 61 governments taking office since 1945. Its political landscape has been characterized by chronic squabbling between numerous parties across the political spectrum, which has thwarted attempts to form stable governments and reform its political system. Elsewhere in the world, Israel has always been governed by alliances between its various parties, with power traditionally alternating between a center-right-led Likud government in coalition with several right-wing and religious parties and periods of rule by the center-left Labor in coalition with several left-wing parties.","Fears in Britain that a hung parliament will leave the country with a weak government .

"(CNN) -- A trial date has been set for May for an Alabama man accused of killing his new bride during their honeymoon in Australia. David Gabriel ""Gabe"" Watson is scheduled to face murder and kidnapping charges on May 23 in an Alabama courtroom, court officials said. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Australian media dubbed Watson ""The Honeymoon Killer"" after his 26-year-old wife, Tina, died October 22, 2003, while the two were diving at a historic shipwreck off the Great Barrier Reef. The incident occurred about 9,000 miles from Birmingham, Alabama, where the couple had married 11 days earlier. Watson returned to the United States after his wife's death and, five years later, remarried. In that same year, 2008, he pleaded guilty in Australia to criminally negligent manslaughter. He finished his sentence there in early November and was subsequently held in immigration detention. Then, in late November, Watson was arrested in Los Angeles after a grand jury in Alabama indicted Watson on two counts -- murder for pecuniary gain and kidnapping where a felony occurred, authorities said. Those charges are based on the premise that Watson hatched the plot to kill his wife while in Alabama. Watson's lawyers have contended that authorities in Alabama manipulated a grand jury to get an indictment against their client. The lawyers have claimed that authorities based the indictment on testimony from Tina Watson's immediate family and a sole Helena, Alabama, investigator, saying of the witnesses ""none could offer more than emotional testimony and hearsay."" The doctrine of double jeopardy -- which says that a person cannot be tried or punished twice for the same crime -- does not apply in Watson's case, according to established legal precedent, legal experts have said. Double jeopardy does not apply because two separate sovereigns, a state government and a foreign government, were seeking to prosecute, said John Lentine, a Birmingham criminal defense attorney and law school professor. Australian authorities investigated Tina Watson's death for years, according to inquest findings in June 2008. Townsville, Queensland, Coroner David Glascow pressed for charges after determining that the drowning couldn't be deemed accidental. According to the inquest, Watson told Glascow that his new bride appeared to panic while 45 feet underwater in the reef, 42 miles off the coast of Townsville. But Glascow cited inconsistencies in Watson's statements, saying that investigators found that ""some of Gabe's explanations lacked credibility."" Glascow noted that Tina Watson's father, in a sworn statement, said Watson asked her to maximize her life insurance and make him a beneficiary shortly before their wedding. The insurance company confirmed Watson asked about his wife's insurance policy after her death, according to the coroner. Watson's attorneys have said that their client pleaded guilty in Australia only ""for failing to rescue his wife (because) he merely did not do enough to save her.""","David Gabriel ""Gabe"" Watson faces murder and kidnapping charges .

"(CNN) -- Mychal Bell, a black teenager accused of beating a white classmate and who was the last of the ""Jena 6"" behind bars, was released from custody Thursday after a juvenile court judge set his bail at $45,000. Supporters surround Mychal Bell on Thursday after his release at the LaSalle Parish courthouse. Bell's release followed an announcement from LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters, who said he would not appeal a higher court's decision moving Bell's case to juvenile court. Wearing a blue striped golf shirt and jeans, Bell walked out of the LaSalle Parish courthouse a week after an estimated 15,000-plus demonstrators marched through Jena -- a town of about 3,000 -- to protest local authorities' handling of the teens' case. ""We do not condone violence of any kind, but we ask that people be given a fair and even chance at the bar of justice,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton said outside the courthouse. ""Tonight, Mychal can go home, but Mychal is not out of the juvenile process. He goes home because a lot of people left their home and stood up for him,"" he said. ""Let America know -- we are not fighting for the right to fight in school. We're not fighting for the right for kids to beat each other. We're fighting to say that there must be one level of justice for everybody. And you cannot have adult attempted murder for some, and a fine for others, and call that equal protection under the law. Two wrongs don't make one civil right."" Demonstrators at last week's march were protesting how authorities handled the cases of Bell and five other teens accused of beating fellow student Justin Barker. Many said they were angry that the students, dubbed the Jena 6, were being treated more harshly than three white students who hung nooses from an oak tree on Jena High School property. The white students were suspended from school but did not face criminal charges. The protesters said they should have been charged with a hate crime. Bell's attorney Lewis Scott said the teen was moved from jail to a juvenile facility earlier Thursday. Walters said his decision not to appeal was based on what he believed was best for the victim in the case. ""While I believe that a review would have merit ... I believe it is in the best interest of the victim and his family not to delay this matter any further and move it to its conclusion,"" Walters told reporters.  Watch the Rev. Al Sharpton discuss the teen's release » . He said last week's march, which included Sharpton and Martin Luther King III, did not influence his decision. Bell, now 17, was the only one of the Jena 6 behind bars. His bond previously was set at $90,000. A district judge earlier this month tossed out Bell's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree battery, saying the matter should have been handled in juvenile court. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal in Lake Charles, Louisiana, did the same with Bell's battery conviction in mid-September. Prosecutors originally charged all six black students accused of being involved in beating Barker with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy. Walters reduced charges against at least four of them -- Bell, Robert Bailey Jr., Carwin Jones and Theo Shaw -- to battery and conspiracy. Bryant Purvis awaits arraignment. Charges against Jesse Ray Beard, who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime, are unavailable because he's a juvenile. Wednesday, Gov. Kathleen Blanco announced that Louisiana State Police officers will protect the families of the Jena 6 and investigate any threats they have received. A white supremacist Web site posted the names and addresses of the six black teens after last week's march, calling on followers to ""let them know justice is coming."" Thursday, the FBI said it had been made aware of allegations of threats. ""Threats are taken seriously, and as these investigations are ongoing we cannot comment further,"" said Sheila Thorne of the FBI's office in New Orleans, Louisiana. The December 4 attack on Barker came after months of racial tension, including at least two instances of fighting in the town, sparked originally when three white teens hung the nooses. Walters has said there was no direct link between the hanging of the nooses and the schoolyard attack, and defended the prosecutions ahead of last Thursday's peaceful march. Blanco defended the prosecutor Wednesday, saying, ""He has a solid record and is highly respected among his peers."" Walters also addressed the stress and notoriety the town has been subjected to, saying the only way he and other residents ""have been able to endure the trauma that has been thrust upon us is through the prayers of the Christian people who have sent them up in this community."" He also suggested that some kind of ""disaster"" was averted when thousands of marchers came to Jena last week. ""I firmly believe and am confident of the fact that had it not been for the direct intervention of the Lord Jesus Christ last Thursday, a disaster would have happened,"" Walters said. ""The Lord Jesus Christ put his influence on those people, and they responded accordingly,"" he said, without explaining exactly what he meant. Soon after the district attorney spoke, a local reverend took issue with his comments. ""Obviously, we are serving two different gods here,"" the Rev. Donald Sidley said. ""My Bible says that we should do -- we should be loving, love your neighbor as yourself. ""For him to try and separate the community like he is and then using Christ Jesus to influence the people that Jesus is working on their side, well, that's -- that's absurd. ... God is god of the human race,"" said Sidley, of the New Evergreen Church.  E-mail to a friend .","Bell released from custody after juvenile court judge sets bail at $45,000 .

"CNN Senior Producer Sasha Johnson traveled to Coaldale, Pennsylvania, to talk to voters, including some members of her extended family, about how a typical small town like Coaldale might vote in 2008 and what issues are on their minds. Coaldale Mayor Claire Remington and her husband, Otis, talk politics in their kitchen . COALDALE, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Coaldale is a borough of 2,200, nestled in the anthracite-rich mountains in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania. It's exactly the type of place Sen. Barack Obama referenced last week when he said some Pennsylvanians were ""bitter"" over their poor economic situation. Obama said he regretted the word choice but continued to argue that some voters feel desperate. After spending a day talking with Coaldale voters, it seems to me the anger Obama described in his now controversial comments might not have been too far off the mark. ""It's time for the politicians to come down to our level,"" said Ruth Weiss during the lunch hour at Tommy's, Coaldale's only casual eatery among a row of shuttered shops and next to a 60-year-old movie theater that has survived. ""People can't afford food. I'm paying for oil for the restaurant out of my own Social Security check."" Ruth and her husband, Tommy, describe their small pizza and sub restaurant on East Phillips Street as a ""country store,"" a place where the regulars can gather to talk, share a meal or -- as is the case lately -- sip a cup of coffee. ""This is my business, but people can't afford it,"" said Ruth. She detailed the myriad of problems she and others are facing -- rising gas prices, increased taxes, out of control food and prescription costs. It is no wonder, she said, people can't afford lunch or dinner at the restaurant they've owned for 25 years. Coaldale's history . I did not find Coaldale's quiet streets by accident. My Russian Orthodox grandmother was born here and some family still lives in and around the house on Fisher Avenue where she and her nine siblings grew up while their father worked the mines. Coaldale, like many other small Pennsylvania communities, has seen better times. Back in the 1930s, when the surrounding hills were bustling with anthracite mining, around 7,000 people lived here. By the 1950s, the mines were closing. In the 30 years that followed, the garment factories in and around town shut down. Today, many of Coaldale's residents are elderly and on fixed incomes. The cost of living is low, so there is the occasional new neighbor, but the shrinking population and tough economic times could force the closure of several churches, forcing people to worship elsewhere. Without a grocery store or a single stoplight, my great-uncle John Zenzel frequently jokes, ""Coaldale is more boring than Mayberry."" Coaldale and the '08 election . Claire Remington, Coaldale's mayor since 2001 and lifelong resident, said her constituents are ""tightlipped"" about who will get their vote in the primary. On a drive through town, only a ""Ron Paul for President"" yard sign could be found. Remington says the town is roughly split between Democrats and Republicans, a change from past elections. Historically, Coaldale -- like Schuylkill County at-large -- has leaned Republican. This election season, however, the county has mirrored trends across the state -- more voters switching to the Democratic Party and more new voters registering as Democrats. ""I'm a die-hard Republican, but I have to say this year things are going to be a little different for me,"" said Remington, who is part of the town's tight-knit Russian Orthodox community. ""The party is going to be upset with me, but I feel that we need a change."" At this point Remington plans to cast a write-in vote for Obama in the primary. She joins her husband, Otis, in supporting Obama. ""This time around I'm dead set against voting for Hillary Clinton,"" said Otis, a longtime Democrat and retired Navy reservist. ""As far as Barack goes, he's young, he's inexperienced, he's new, but I think given a chance he could be a good president."" Claire said she is reluctant to advertise her support for Obama in the form of a yard sign because she fears her neighbors would think she is supporting him because Otis is African-American. Claire is white. The two conceded race is an underlying factor in voters' decisions, and both cited the state's rainbow of immigrant ethnic groups and Gov. Ed Rendell's comment that an African-American might have trouble winning statewide. ""I do think he's right,"" she said. ""I hope he's wrong, though."" Both Otis and Claire describe a visceral reaction to Clinton. They say they can't shake the memories of Whitewater or the belief that President Bill Clinton could have done more for the military during his time in the White House. Back down the hill at Tommy's, Ruth and Tommy Weiss will gladly cast their primary ballot for Clinton. Tommy says Obama is an unknown and believes Clinton will be a ""good start, although we don't expect her to do everything."" They are both comforted by the fact that Bill Clinton would play some role in his wife's administration -- but they want her to have the final say. ""She'll hold him at bay when she needs to,"" said Tommy. Neither of the Weisses could say for sure they would vote for Obama if he were their party's nominee in November. John Zenzel, a World War II Navy veteran, has been waiting ""a long time"" to vote for Clinton. He believes she deserves ""another chance"" to revamp health care, something he is banking on as his yearly health insurance costs approach $3,000. Zenzel, 82, still lives in the house where he was born and raised. As the April 22 primary approaches, he is not banking on any of the candidates paying a visit to his sleepy town but that doesn't diminish his excitement or hope that a new president will ease the daily hardships that he and his neighbors face. The last time Zenzel remembers a White House aspirant coming anywhere near the borough was in 1960 when John F. Kennedy drove through nearby Hometown and Tamaqua. Zenzel remembers waiting on the street and jumping through the crowd to shake Kennedy's hand. E-mail to a friend .","Coaldale is the type of town Barack Obama described last week .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When a grenade bounced off his chest and fell to the floor near his fellow troops, Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Monsoor acted out of instinct. His actions didn't stem from a lack of training. His instant reaction was to protect his comrades. The Navy says he committed a selfless act: jumping on the grenade and taking the full force of the blast. President Bush presented Monsoor's parents with a posthumous Medal of Honor for their son at an emotional White House ceremony on Tuesday.  Watch Monsoor's sister share her memories » . Bush quoted one of the SEALS saved by Monsoor as saying, ""Mikey looked death in the face that day and said, 'You cannot take my brothers. I will go in their stead.'""  Watch the president bestow the award » . Monsoor was one of the U.S. military's most highly trained combatants, a Navy SEAL. He's the first SEAL to receive the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq. On September 29, 2006, Monsoor was part of a major clearing and isolating operation to root out enemy fighters holding parts of Ramadi, the Sunni insurgent stronghold west of Baghdad. Monsoor was in a sniper position on a rooftop along with two other SEALs when a grenade flew into his location from out of nowhere. It bounced off his chest and landed in an area where it probably would have killed or seriously wounded all three of them. Monsoor was in a position to escape before the explosion but instead leapt on the grenade. ""He recognized immediately the threat, yelled 'grenade' and due to the fact that two other SEAL snipers, our brothers, could not possibly escape the blast, he chose to smother it with his body, absorbed the impact and lost his life in the process,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Seth Stone, Mansoor's platoon commander. The blast did not kill him right away; he hung on for 30 minutes. His two comrades were wounded but survived the shrapnel that ripped through their bodies. Stone said: ""He essentially saved [the] Navy SEALS on the rooftop and three Iraqi soldiers who were there."" Until this month, when the White House announced that Monsoor would receive the Medal of Honor posthumously, few people knew of his story. Born in 1981 in Long Beach, California, Monsoor excelled as a high school athlete. He joined the Navy before the September 11 attacks. In 2004, Monsoor graduated from the basic SEAL training course as one of the top members of his class. By March 2005, he had completed his training and was assigned to SEAL Team 3, Delta Platoon. In April 2006, that unit deployed to Iraq's troubled and violent western provincial capital of Ramadi. Monsoor would not return home alive. His five-month stay in Ramadi was marked by constant attacks. As a heavy machine gunner, Monsoor had to stay behind the point man on foot patrols and protect the unit from attacks. Delta Platoon was involved in attacks on 75 percent of its missions in a highly contested part of Ramadi called the Ma'laab district, according to the Navy. On a patrol less than a month after arriving in Iraq, Monsoor showed some of his selfless instinct when gunfire hit a fellow SEAL in the leg. Monsoor ""ran out into the street with another SEAL, shot cover fire and dragged his comrade to safety while enemy bullets kicked up the concrete at their feet,"" according to Navy documents. He received the Silver Star, the third highest award for valor in combat. His unit continued to endure the constant barrage of attacks and some 35 firefights with insurgent forces over the scorching Iraqi summer. Monsoor also was saddled with carrying heavy radio equipment on his back as the ""SEAL communicator"" who called in tank and other support during firefights. He received the Bronze Star for his work as an adviser for Iraqi troops. ""His leadership, guidance and decisive actions during 11 different combat operations saved the lives of his teammates, other [U.S.-led] coalition forces and Iraqi army soldiers,"" according to Navy documents. But it was his instinct on his last operation on that Ramadi roof that solidified Monsoor's standing as a hero.

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- The United States and Cuba should show some flexibility and take steps to improve relations, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said Friday during a weeklong trade mission to the island nation. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson calls for ""concrete steps"" to improve ties between the United States and Cuba. ""There is a good atmosphere [between the two countries],"" he said at a news conference in Havana on Friday. ""It is the best atmosphere I've seen in many years."" Richardson called for ""concrete steps from both sides,"" but noted a ""lack of flexibility in their positions"" and reciprocity from the Cuban government. He also called on the United States to ""pay more attention to the Cuba issue, though acknowledged more urgent U.S. priorities like health-care reform have drawn attention away from normalizing relations. In his first trip to Cuba in 13 years, when he negotiated the release of three political prisoners in 1996, Richardson said he is not in Cuba as a special U.S. envoy. ""My main objective is trade and to improve commercial ties with Cuba,"" he said, though he acknowledged plans to report recommendations to the Obama administration early next week.  Watch Richardson discuss goals for Cuba trip » . Despite the near half-century trade embargo, the U.S. Treasury Department allows U.S. states to sell agricultural, medical and IT products in Cuba on a cash basis. The governor also called on the Obama administration to ease restrictions of biotechnology products, allow Cubans to travel to the United States for academic and cultural exchanges, and implement the changes to Cuban-American travel and remittances announced in April. He mentioned a proposal to allow diplomats in either country to move more freely and offered to broker a dialogue between the Cuban government and Cuban-Americans. ""If there's going to be a solution for the normalization of relationship between Cuba and the United States, Cuban-Americans must play a role,"" he said, noting that any such dialogue would not substitute government-to-government talks. Richardson -- known for his diplomatic resume, including high-level talks with North Korea, Sudan and Iraq -- met with Cuba's National Assembly president, Ricardo Alarcon, and received a personal letter from former President Fidel Castro. ""It was a positive message that I got,"" he said of the letter. The former presidential candidate was nominated for Commerce Secretary in the Obama administration, but withdrew amid an investigation over whether CDR Financial Products inappropriately won $1.4 million in state work for New Mexico.","New Mexico Gov.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal from a female death row inmate who said fetal alcohol syndrome should have been considered by the state court that reviewed her sentence. The U.S. Supreme Court has closely monitored Louisiana's capital punishment system in recent years. The justices gave no reason for rejecting the appeal, which challenged the constitutionality of Louisiana's capital sentencing procedures and argued that Brandy Holmes' alleged developmental disabilities should disqualify her from execution. Holmes, 29, is one of two women scheduled to be executed in Louisiana. She and a male co-defendant were convicted of murder in the New Year's Day 2003 death of Julian Brandon, a retired minister near Shreveport. Holmes is being held at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women at St. Gabriel. Experts on fetal alcohol syndrome call it the nation's leading preventable cause of mental retardation. As many as 40,000 newborns in the United States are affected each year by their mother's alcohol use, according to an advocacy group. The syndrome can lead to brain damage, behavioral problems and intellectual disabilities. Holmes' attorneys said she functions like a 10- to 12-year-old. ""Brandy has a hallmark case of FAS,"" said Tom Donaldson, president of the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, which supported the defendant in her high court appeal. ""Her mother testified that she drank throughout her pregnancy, and in fact named her daughter after her favorite drink. Brandy's capacity to appreciate the criminality of her actions or to conform to the law is very seriously impaired."" Donaldson and others argue the medical and legal system is unprepared to recognize, intervene and educate when presented with the majority of FAS-related cases, especially those involving younger defendants. In a petition to the justices, Holmes' attorney, Charles Ogletree, argued the Louisiana Supreme Court did not ""review the extensive mitigating circumstances that limited Ms. Holmes's moral culpability and compare them to the mitigating circumstances presented in similar cases. The [state] court also failed to consider that petitioner's co-defendant received a death sentence and that the prosecutor stated at the co-defendant's trial that he (and not the petitioner) was the more culpable party."" That co-defendant, Robert Coleman, remains on death row at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. Ogletree is a noted Harvard Law School professor who taught President Obama when he was a law student. The state in its reply brief noted the violent nature of the robbery-murder. The victim's wife also suffered gunshot wounds in the attack. She lived in a severely impaired state for years and passed away in October 2008. Investigators said Holmes tried to use the victims' ATM card and destroyed evidence of the crime. Detectives said she even stole a videotape of her confession that was left unattended at the police station. ""Holmes destroyed this tape by sneaking it into the ladies' room and flushing the magnetic tape down the toilet, after substituting a blank tape in the stack of taped statements that had been left unsecured on a detective's desk,"" according the the state's brief. Police also suspect she flushed jewelry she had been wearing, which they suggested may have been stolen from the Brandons. The Supreme Court previously had banned execution of the mentally retarded, though the justices established no clear benchmark on IQ test results to guide criminal courts. The justices also have closely monitored Louisiana's capital punishment system in recent years, criticizing in some cases the role of some prosecutors and the procedural guarantees required in such cases. The justices last year ordered a new trial for an African-American capital defendant after finding problems with how prosecutors excluded blacks from an all-white jury. That same year, the high court blocked use of the death penalty for a New Orleans-area man convicted of child rape. Louisiana was one of the few states that had actively pushed execution for nonhomicide crimes. Fifty-three women remain on death row around the country. Forty women have been executed in the past century -- 11 since 1976 when the Supreme Court restored capital punishment, according the Death Penalty Information Center. The other woman on death row in Louisiana is Antoinette Frank, a former New Orleans policewoman convicted of three murders, including that of her former partner on the police force. Her scheduled execution last year was delayed indefinitely by appeal. The high court also announced Monday that it will not hear appeals in the following cases: .","Defense argued alleged disabilities should disqualify Brandy Holmes from execution .

"(CNN)  -- Tiger Woods battled to three-under-69 on the north course at Torrey Pines as he made a solid start to his 2011 PGA Tour campaign. Woods, who has slipped to number three in the world rankings behind European pair Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer, carded three birdies without a bogey to leave himself well-placed in the Farmers Insurance Open at tied for 22nd. He was five shots behind leader Sunghoon Kang after the South Korean rookie claimed a one-stroke first-round advantage from Americans Rickie Fowler and Alex Prugh. ""I played alright today,"" Woods told the Golf Channel. ""These are some of the narrowest fairways we've seen on tour, it was tough."" Woods has won seven times at his favorite venue in La Jolla in California, the last victory in 2008 at the U.S. Open. That left him on 14 major wins, the run halted by first injury and then the damaging revelations of marital infidelities which led to a self-imposed exile from tournament golf. Woods was paired with Rocco Mediate, who he beat in the famous playoff to win the 2008 U.S. Open despite being hampered by leg injuries. A third American, Anthony Kim, made up the group and shot 68. Starting on the 10th in perfect playing conditions, Woods picked up birdies on the 12th, second and sixth. A further birdie chance came at the seventh, but his putt slid by and a rare errant tee shot on the next left him in trouble in a fairway bunker. His second shot failed to find the green, Woods hammering his club to the ground in frustration, but he showed his old powers of recovery with a pitch and single putt to save par. He was also left frustrated after failing to gain his birdie on the par-five ninth after another indifferent drive, but has happy with his overall display. Crowd favorite John Daly, who played the south course, was among the early clubhouse pacesetters with a superb five-under 67 and ended the day tied for fifth along with Woods' great rival Phil Mickelson and 2009 U.S. PGA champion Y.E. Yang of South Korea. But it was Yang's 24-year-old compatriot Kang who took the first-day plaudits after a fine 64. Also playing the north course and starting on the 10th, he carded three birdies and an eagle on his front nine and closed with three birdies in his last four holes for a flawless round. On the same course, Prugh closed with four successive birdies after starting on the front nine, while last season's rookie of the year Fowler picked up a shot at the last playing from 10. The 22-year-old's 65 featured one dropped shot but he still finished one ahead of 25-year-old American rookie Chris Kirk. Last weekend's Bob Hope Classic winner, Venezuelan rookie Jhonattan Vegas, was one of 13 players on 69 along with Woods, U.S. Ryder Cup player Hunter Mahan and Colombian Camilo Villegas. Mediate was tied for 54th in an even bigger group on 71 along with rookie Joseph Bramlett, the first African American golfer to earn a tour card through qualifying school in 25 years.","Tiger Woods shoots a solid 69 in his first round at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Israeli officials are seeking a meeting with Turkey's ambassador to protest a show on Turkish television that reportedly depicts Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian children. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman says the Turkish TV show ""is being done with state sponsorship."" Turkey has been Israel's strongest Muslim ally in the Middle East, and the move comes as relations between the countries have soured in recent days over the latter's decision to exclude Israel from scheduled military exercises. The Turkish TV show ""constitutes the most serious level of incitement, and it is being done with state sponsorship,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in a statement. The show aired this week on Turkey's state-run TRT-1 network. It shows an actor dressed as an Israeli soldier shooting what appears to be an unarmed Palestinian girl. In another sequence, an Israeli soldier opens fire on an infant being held by what appears to be a family member. ""Such a series which bears no connection whatsoever to reality, presenting IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers as murderers of innocent children, should not be broadcast even in hostile states -- and certainly not in a state that maintains full diplomatic relations with Israel,"" Lieberman said. The show called ""Ayrilik"" is billed on the TRT Web site as the ""first time a TV series shows the ongoing, bleeding wound of the world which is taking place on Palestinian lands. It shows the painful stories of the people who lived on invaded Palestinian lands in 1948, especially women and children."" Israel and Turkey have enjoyed close military and economic ties for more than a decade. But relations have grown testy at times in recent years over Israel's activities in the Palestinian territories and over its Gaza offensive in December and January. On Tuesday, a senior U.S. military official said Turkey's decision this week to postpone a NATO war exercise appears to have been a political decision intended to exclude the Israelis. The official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, said U.S. officials were uncomfortable about excluding Israel and so welcomed postponing the maneuvers in which U.S. military units were scheduled to participate. The exercises were to start Monday and run through October 23. Turkish lawmaker Suat Kiniklioglu, deputy chairman of the external affairs committee for the ruling Justice and Development Party, said that it isn't ""state policy for Turkish television to portray Israel badly."" He said the television network contracts with private producers. ""It's probably some producer who is trying to tap into popular reaction against israel, trying to make money off it,"" said Kiniklioglu, who has not seen the program. Kiniklioglu said it ""would not be wrong to say Turkish-Israeli relations have become much more fragile"" after Gaza, commenting on the exclusion of Israel from military exercises. ""This is basically all about Gaza. ... The humanitarian crisis is continuing and Prime Minister [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan is upset about it."" Alon Liel, Israel's top diplomat in Turkey during the 1980s, said he believes the relations between the two countries are in crisis. ""This unbelievable attack on the Israeli army is in the country that in the last 15 years was probably the closest to our army, so it's a major surprise, a major change,"" Liel said. CNN's Ivan Watson and Yesim Comert contributed to this report.","Turkish TV show reportedly shows Israeli soliders killing young Palestinians .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Rory McIlroy may be tipped for great things but according to the ""CNN Living Golf"" producer, Chris Eldergill, his home course is on the road to success as well. The CNN crew with Rory McIlroy at the Lough Erne Golf Resort, Northern Ireland. In these troubled times, you're hard pushed to find a golf development which either hasn't been put on hold or canceled altogether. That coupled with the fact that golf tourism in Northern Ireland has been in steep decline, it's a testament to the people of Lough Erne Golf Resort that they're opening their brand new championship course this summer. We have just returned from Lough Erne, which is situated about two hours west of Belfast in Northern Ireland, after spending some time with golf's biggest teenage sensation, Lough Erne's attached professional Rory McIlroy.  Watch a preview of the show » . Whilst it was impressive to see such maturity from a 19 year old who has achieved so much so young, it was also impressive to see the surroundings he is blessed with. Created by six-time major champion Nick Faldo, The Faldo Course will be a par-72 layout set on a breath-taking peninsula -- if the photos don't help visualize this for you, think Loch Lomond. And like the venue for the annual Scottish Open, don't bet against this being a regular stop on the European Tour in the near future. During our stay, we were itching to get out and experience some of the course for ourselves but with gusting winds and with water on 14 of the 18 holes, only the brave or very talented would have survived... and neither applied to us! But with such a rich tradition of superb golf courses in Northern Ireland like Royal Portrush, Castlerock and Royal County Down, how will Lough Erne compete? Simple... their resident professional. Just days after this year's Open Championship at Turnberry in Scotland, McIlroy will take on Ireland's greatest ever golfer, three times Major Champion, Padraig Harrington, in the inaugural Lough Erne Challenge, a one-day event scheduled for Wednesday, July 22. Harrington is gunning for a third consecutive Open championship whilst McIlroy is aiming to be the youngest Major winner in history -- not bad publicity for a course which would have been open for a mere three weeks. Only 4,000 tickets have been set aside for the event so if you can't make it to Turnberry, you could do worse than to see these two fight it out. CNN Living Golf airs at the times below: .

"(CNN) -- The world's best female golfer, Lorena Ochoa of Mexico, has exclusively revealed to CNN that a meeting with Tiger Woods in her youth inspired her to become the player she is today. Tiger Woods and Lorena Ochoa pose at the Golf Writer's Association of America Awards in 2007. The pair first met at Tory Pines when both competing in the Junior World Championships, an event that Woods won a record six times and Ochoa has won five. The two then met again 15 years later at the Golf Writer's Association of America Awards where both were named players of the year. Ochoa, 27, told CNN's Living Golf program the meeting had a big impact on her: ""You don't realize the importance of things until you're older and look back.  I'm just glad it worked out the way it did for us. ""He was boy and I was a girl, we were both young and we didn't know what we were doing.  I didn't see him for another 15 years, but I reminded him and showed him the pictures and he was like ""wow""."" Ochoa, who started playing golf aged just five-years-old, has now won 26 LPGA Tour titles but said despite the success it has been harder to sustain her number one spot than it was to attain it. ""It's harder to stay number one than getting there - if you get distracted or stop practicing you can very easily lose your position. Ochoa overtook Annika Sörenstam to become the world number one ranked golfer in 2007 and since has won two majors, including the Women's British Open and the Kraft Nabisco Championship. The Mexican also picked up the Honda LPGA Thailand recently but says her drive to win more remains the same: ""My life has changed a lot. I've been preparing myself to get to that position so it didn't take me by surprise.  It took me five years from turning professional to becoming the number on in the world. It's not easy but it's been a lot of fun and I want to stay here.""

"(CNN) -- She's been compared to the Dalai Lama, the Chinese Tibetan Buddhist leader, but the name Rebiya Kadeer doesn't ring a bell to many people outside of China. Rebiya Kadeer has been dubbed ""the Mother of All Uyghurs."" Nevertheless, the world-famous man and the relatively obscure woman share similarities that chime with political relevance. A diminutive northern Virginia resident, Kadeer has emerged as the voice of the restive but relatively unknown Uyghur Muslims, a Turkic-speaking ethnic minority in China, and the group's far-flung diaspora. And like the Dalai Lama, she's revered by supporters and reviled by the Chinese government. ""Even though one is a man, and the other is a woman, they have one thing in common, and that is they engage in activities to split the motherland and damage national unity,"" said Qin Gang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Kadeer, 62, emerged in the world media spotlight after China blamed her for stoking July's unrest in China's remote Xinjiang Autonomous Region, an area four times the size of California in the northwestern part of the country. Reports vary on the number of people killed, ranging from around 200 to many more. The problems began in late June, after two Uyghur migrant workers at a toy factory in Guangdong province were killed after a brawl between Uyghurs and ethnic Han Chinese -- the majority group in China. Uyghurs protested in Urumqi, the Xinjiang capital, hundreds of miles from the toy factory. Uyghurs and Han reportedly attacked each other. Nur Bekri, the Chinese government's top official in Xinjiang, accused Kadeer and the World Uyghur Congress she leads of instigating the unrest via the Internet. ""The violence is premeditated, organized violent crime,"" Bekri said. ""It was instigated and directed from abroad and carried out by outlaws in the country."" China's constitution guarantees ethnic minorities equal rights and limited autonomy. And the Chinese government has implemented several programs designed to help ethnic minorities, but Kadeer says China still treats Uyghurs as second-class citizens -- and she blames China for most of the recent unrest. Since the violence erupted, Kadeer has worked the media with a mission, drumming up support for the Uyghur cause and shining a light on what she says are China's ""unjust policies"" toward her people. The estimated size of Uyghur population in China ranges from 8 million to 11 million people, making them a distinct minority in a country of 1.5 billion people. Uyghurs have long complained of being treated as a lesser class, but China has dismissed that charge and touted its commitment to ethnic unity. ""Let them hear our voice and raise public awareness about our situation,"" Kadeer told CNN. ""That's the main thing that I wish to do right now."" Dubbed ""the Mother of All Uyghurs,"" Kadeer doesn't quite fit the profile of a political firebrand. Born in modest circumstances, Kadeer fell into dire poverty amid the late Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong's forced relocation programs. She worked her way up from laundry worker to become a millionaire businesswoman as China opened to free enterprise. She amassed an empire with department stores, real estate, lumber, scrap iron, factories and other enterprises. She was also chosen as a member of a Chinese National Congress and other posts. However, the mother of 11 children -- some of whom are in jail in China -- wasn't shy about speaking out about the conditions faced by Uyghurs, such as political imprisonment. Her activism landed her in jail in 1999, an incarceration that attracted international attention and condemnation from rights groups and Western political officials. China released her on medical grounds in 2005 amid pressure from the U.S. government. She was granted political asylum in the United States, reunited with her husband, and embarked on activist work. Along with her role as president of the World Uyghur Congress, Kadeer is the president of the board of the Uyghur American Association and the full-time director of the International Uyghur Human Rights and Democracy Foundation. Those groups receive money from U.S. taxpayers through the National Endowment for Democracy, a private, nonprofit organization created ""to strengthen democratic institutions"" around the world. Hugh Pope, author of the ""Sons of the Conquerors: The Rise of the Turkic World,"" describes Kadeer as a skillful and hard-working activist who has done a lot for the Uyghurs. He said she is well-situated in the Washington area, where she has easy access to media outlets, and is a ""natural focal point"" for the Uyghur rights cause. ""She has a canny sense on how to get on top of the situation. As long as she can maintain the Dalai Lama-like profile, she will persist in being a spokeswoman for the Uyghurs,"" Pope said. Dru Gladney, an expert on China and its ethnic groups, described Kadeer as a significant leader who is a charismatic, determined and maternal figure who can move easily among the elites and the common people. She has a message that can unite Uyghurs, and China's criticism of her in some ways has enhanced her stature, said Gladney, president of Pacific Basin Institute at Pomona College in California. ""She seems like somebody all Uyghurs can look up to,"" he said. He noted that her following is ""quite remarkable"" since she is a woman and both Muslim and Chinese cultures are patriarchal. She abhors violence and favors peaceful resolution of conflicts, Gladney said. In that respect, she mirrors the non-violent sentiment espoused by the Dalai Lama, who wrote an introduction to Kadeer's autobiography ""Dragon Fighter,"" recently published in English. ""The Uyghur and the Tibetan people have a history of relationship and in modern times have shared somewhat similar experiences. I therefore hope that this book by Mrs. Kadeer will enable the readers to comprehend the experience of the Uyghur people,"" the Dalai Lama wrote. Kadeer told CNN she has had ""close communication"" with the Dalai Lama. She said ""our philosophy in peace is the same"" and said the movements of both peoples for justice are connected. ""If the Chinese have the authority to destroy one of them, they have the authority to destroy the other,"" she said. China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday that Chinese President Hu Jintao, in a visit to Yunnan province this week, urged all people to show mutual respect and concern. He also said all ethnic minorities are important members of the Chinese family, the news agency reported in a story that did not specifically mention Uyghurs. The Communist Party of China and the government plan to emphasize more strongly developing areas inhabited by ethnic minorities and strengthen support to improve their livelihood, according to Xinhua's paraphrasing of Hu's remarks. In a recent Wall Street Journal essay, ""China's Ethnic Fault Lines,"" Gladney wrote that by the mid-1980s ""official minorities were beginning to receive real benefits from the implementation of several affirmative action programs."" They include ""permission to have more children (except in urban areas, minorities are generally not bound by the one-child policy),"" paying fewer taxes,  getting ""greater access to public office,"" and better education for children -- in Mandarin Chinese rather than native tongues. Kadeer has spent much of the last few weeks plowing through media interviews and chatting about how she juggles being the ""Mother of All Uyghurs"" with being a mother to her flesh-and-blood children. ""My family is very supportive of my activity,"" she said through a translator. Yet she has spent time apart from her husband, also a Uyghur activist, and children because of political ferment and imprisonment. Kadeer says this is a ""very dark time for the Uyghur people."" She condemned Chinese security forces for killing and injuring Uyghur demonstrators this month in Urumqi. Unrest also took place in the cities of Kashgar and Hotan, she said. While she focuses on what she says is the Chinese crackdown against Uyghurs in ""East Turkestan"" -- the name Uyghurs use for the region -- she also condemned reported violence by ""a number of Uyghur demonstrators."" ""Uyghur demonstrators were doubtless expressing discontent over the severe and comprehensive repression they have suffered for years in East Turkestan,"" she said. She cited ""arbitrary detention, torture, and execution"" the repression of their religion, ""forced abortion and discrimination in several spheres, including health care and employment."" In her talks, Kadeer -- who sports braids and a traditional Uyghur dopa cap -- urges China to ""stop the cultural genocide"" and ""address the legitimate grievances of the Uyghur people."" ""I do believe that even our enemy would come dine at our table,"" she said, ""because what we have been doing is in a peaceful way. So I do believe that they would come to our table and resolve this."" CNN's Jim Clancy contributed to this report.","Rebiya Kadeer emerges as leader of minority Uyghur Muslims in China .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. military's ""don't ask-don't tell"" policy could be overturned in the first year of President-elect Barack Obama's administration, according to the lead sponsor of a bill that would repeal the law. A bill that would repeal the U.S. military's ""don't ask-don't tell"" policy has 149 co-sponsors in the House. Obama has pledged to lift the ban on gays serving openly in the U.S. military. A spokesman for Obama's transition office would not comment for this story, but two months ago, Obama suggested he would move cautiously, telling the Philadelphia Gay News he would first get the military on board. ""Although I have consistently said I would repeal 'don't ask-don't tell,' I believe that the way to do it is to make sure that we are working through processes, getting the Joint Chiefs of Staff clear in terms of what our priorities are going to be,"" Obama told the newspaper. Instituted in 1993, the policy ended the military's practice of asking potential service members if they are gay, but requires the dismissal of openly gay service members. A bill to replace the law with a policy that would allow gays to openly serve has 149 co-sponsors in the U.S. House, including Ellen Tauscher, D-California. Tauscher said that with a new administration, the timing is right to try to pass the bill. ""The key here is to get bills that pass the House and the Senate, that we can get to President-elect Obama to sign, and I think that we can do that, certainly, the first year of the administration,"" Tauscher told CNN. Gay rights advocates say it's important for Obama to avoid the approach used by the Clinton administration. President Clinton initially promised to repeal the military's then-complete ban on gays with an executive order. But the plan roiled Pentagon brass -- including then-Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell -- and provoked a fierce backlash from conservatives in Congress. Congress stripped Clinton of his power to change the policy and forced him to accept the ""don't ask-don't tell"" compromise -- a law that can be repealed only by Congress. But after 15 years and four wars, attitudes in the Pentagon -- and among the public -- have changed. A Washington Post/ABC News poll this summer found 75 percent of Americans support allowing gays to serve openly, compared to only 45 percent in 1993. Retired Adm. Charles Larson, the former head of the Naval Academy, heads a list of more than 100 retired U.S. military leaders who have signed a statement calling for an end the policy, according to the Palm Center at the University of California-Santa Barbara.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- A vicious turf war between drug cartels and Mexican authorities that has left as many as 4,300 dead so far this year may have caused a breach in the internal security systems of Interpol, the international police organization. A member of the Federal Investigative Agency participates in an narcotics operation. Interpol, which is based in France, announced Wednesday it is sending a team of investigators to Mexico to investigate the possibility that its communications systems and databases are not being used for legitimate law enforcement purposes. The prospect was raised after the arrest of the top official working with the agency in the country. Ricardo Gutierrez Vargas, director for International Police Affairs at Mexico's Federal Investigative Agency and the head of Mexico's Interpol office, was placed under house arrest Sunday, the attorney general's office said Tuesday. More than 30 officials have been arrested since July in connection with the anti-corruption Operation Limpieza, an ongoing investigation into information leaks by law enforcement officials to drug traffickers, said Niverda Amado, a government press secretary in Mexico City. Gutierrez can be held for up to 40 days while authorities ""obtain sufficient evidence to determine his probable responsibility,"" the attorney general's office said in a news release. Rodolfo de la Guardia Garcia, a former top official at the Federal Investigative Agency, also is under 40-day house arrest. He was arrested October 29. Mexico's Interpol office, or National Central Bureau, is staffed and run by the Federal Investigative Agency. Mexican officials did not offer specifics on their investigation other than to say that Operation Limpieza, which means ""Operation Cleanup,"" is aimed ""against public servants who give reserved information to people not authorized to have it."" Interpol said in a news release Wednesday it needs to make sure the agency's information remains secure. ""As Mexico's attorney general's office has a duty to ensure that Interpol's communications system and databases are being used for legitimate law enforcement purposes and in compliance with Interpol's rules, Interpol is immediately dispatching a team of general secretariat staff to Mexico,"" Interpol said. ""The purpose of their mission is to meet with relevant Mexican authorities in order to establish if there are any allegations of improper use of Interpol's systems by any Mexican law enforcement official."" After the investigation, Interpol said, the agency will determine whether proper security steps have been taken. ""An assessment can then be made of the procedures put in place by the attorney general's office, which is responsible for the Interpol office in Mexico, to ensure that Interpol's rules and regulations are being followed,"" the agency said. The arrests came amid ""a war of master proportions"" between authorities and narcotics traffickers that has left more than 4,300 dead so far this year, according to the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, an independent research and information organization. By comparison, the council said in a report Tuesday, there were 2,700 drug-related deaths in 2007. ""Homegrown drug cartels operating from both within and outside the country are engaging in a vicious turf war to seize control of major trafficking corridors while engaging in almost open warfare against the mobilized forces of the state,"" the council says about what it calls ""narco-fueled crime."" Mexican leaders have been trying to tamp down the violence by tightening controls on money-laundering and cracking down on corruption among local and municipal police forces infiltrated by drug traffickers. It may not be enough. ""Due to pervasive corruption at the highest levels of the Mexican government, and the almost effortless infiltration of the porous security forces by the cartel, an ultimate victory by the state is far from certain,"" the Hemispheric Council concludes. Drug trafficking in Mexico is a $20 billion- to $50 billion-a-year industry, as much as the nation earns from tourism or remittances from Mexicans living in the United States, said Robert Pastor, a former national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and now a professor of international relations at American University in Washington. He has been studying Latin America for more than four decades. ""This is a huge industry with an extraordinary capacity to corrupt and intimidate the country. And they're doing both right now,"" said Pastor, also a former director of the Carter Center's Latin American and Caribbean Program. The drug cartels are paying some Mexican officials bribes of $150,000 to $450,000 a month, authorities have said. The payment is far beyond the per capita income of $12,500 a year in Mexico, where one of every seven Mexicans lives in poverty, according to the CIA World Factbook. Pastor believes that Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who took office in December 2006, made a correct assessment that he needs to fight the drug cartels as hard as he can. ""You have to obviously escalate the cost of violating the law,"" he said. The United States also could help more, he said. ""There are 7,600 gun shops within 50 miles of the Mexican border, and they're selling primarily to drug lords,"" Pastor said. ""We are part of this problem and we haven't been significantly supportive."" And while the war may never be completely won, the government can make vast gains, as happened in Colombia, he said. Pastor was in Mexico giving a speech last week when Colombian President Alvaro Uribe met with Mexico's Calderon. Mexicans were quite taken with Uribe's message on how to fight drug traffickers, Pastor said. The first step that Uribe took, he said, was to take the fight to the paramilitary forces, the drug traffickers and the leftist guerrillas known as FARC, who often work in collaboration with the traffickers. Also, Pastor said, Colombian officials ""used money the same way that the narcotraffickers do -- to bribe people. And there's a lot more security on the streets and everywhere else, so people feel safer."" Despite the gains, he said, the ultimate answer may have to come from the political arena, not from law enforcement. ""There's no easy solution to it unless you put an end to the criminalization drugs, and that's not going to happen,"" Pastor said. CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","NEW: Interpol sending team to Mexico to check if sensitive info compromised .

"(CNET) -- Three state attorneys general were scheduled to meet with Craigslist representatives to begin negotiations toward eliminating advertisements from the site for prostitution and other suspected illegal sexual activities. Philip H. Markoff is suspected of killing a 25-year-old masseuse he met through Craigslist at a Boston hotel. State attorneys general from Missouri, Illinois, and Connecticut were to represent a group of state attorneys general in a meeting Tuesday in New York City with representatives of the Web site. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said his office found several ads offering and seeking prostitution on Craigslist pages for the Kansas City, St. Louis, Columbia/Jefferson City, and Springfield areas. ""Craigslist is allowing advertisements for illegal activities like prostitution on its site,"" Koster said a statement. ""It is blatant. It is irresponsible. It is illegal."" Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster expressed optimism toward the goal of reducing illegal activity on the site but stopped short of discussing the removal of the ""erotic services"" section. ""Craigslist looks forward to meeting with the attorneys general, and anticipates making further progress toward the common goal of eliminating illegal activity from Craigslist, while preserving its full utility and benefit for tens of millions of law-abiding Americans who value and depend on Craigslist's free local community services in their everyday lives,"" Buckmaster said in a statement. The site's erotic services section was thrust into the national spotlight following the arrest last month of Philip H. Markoff, who is suspected of killing a 25-year-old masseuse he met through Craigslist at a Boston hotel. Markoff, a 22-year-old medical student at Boston University, was charged with murder, unlawful possession of a firearm, and kidnapping. He is also suspected of attacks on two other escorts at hotels. However, even before the so-called ""Craigslist killing,"" the site had worked with a group of 40 attorneys general to create new measures on the site designed to thwart ads for prostitution and other illegal sexual activities. Craigslist requires anyone posting ads to the erotic services section to submit an operational phone number and credit card, the site announced last year. But those measures don't do enough to stem prostitution, according to a federal lawsuit filed in March against Craigslist by the sheriff of Illinois' Cook County, alleging that the Web's largest classifieds publication is ""facilitating prostitution."" Sheriff Tom Dart asked the court to force Craigslist to remove the erotic services section and for $100,000 in compensation for the man-hours the county paid police to investigate alleged criminal services being advertised on the site. Buckmaster suggested at the time that the suit was a waste of time, saying that ""Craigslist cannot be held liable, as a matter of clear federal law, for content submitted to the site by our users."" Craigslist announced later that month that ads for such services were down 90 percent to 95 percent during the past 12 months on Craigslist sites that serve five major U.S. cities. However, many CNET News readers suggested that the reduction was due to the ads being relabeled and moved to another section. While some portray Craigslist as the world's largest bordello, workers in the sex trade say the site helps reduce the risk of violence prostitutes often face. ""Craigslist is important to helping us avoid violence,"" a 35-year-old sex worker in San Francisco told CNET News last month before the murder in Boston occurred. ""Craigslist is a way to filter out that kind of person...and with Craigslist there is no need for pimps."" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Airlines canceled thousands of flights for a second day and began to regroup as a historic winter storm pushed through the upper Midwest and into the Northeast on Wednesday. O'Hare International Airport was expected to have limited or no flight operations as up to two feet of snow was forecast to fall on the Windy City, said Karen Pride, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of Aviation. More than 1,300 flights were canceled on Tuesday. At Chicago's Midway Airport, airlines canceled flight operations on Tuesday. The carriers expect to begin operating again on Wednesday afternoon, although most weren't likely to resume before evening, Pride said. Both Chicago airports remained open despite the grounding of flights. Hundreds of cots were made available to passengers stranded by the storm, according to Pride. Some concessions were to remain open to accommodate them. Airlines canceled more than 4,000 flights on Tuesday as the massive storm surged out of the southern Plains, spreading snow and ice from Texas into the Ohio Valley. ""It's going to take days to clear out this storm,"" said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. ""This is a monster."" It was also slow going at other airports. Dallas-Fort Worth International reopened late Tuesday morning after shutting down for several hours because of ice, spokesman David Magana said. American Airlines canceled about 1,900 flights for Tuesday, 800 of those at Dallas-Forth Worth alone. The carrier is also scrubbing more than 1,000 flights for Wednesday. American Airlines is allowing travelers who are scheduled to fly on Monday through Thursday from more than 30 airports in the Midwest -- including those in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- to change their plans without penalty. Southwest Airlines canceled more than 900 flights on Tuesday, according to spokeswoman Marilee McInnis, who said hundreds of flights will likely be grounded for Wednesday. Passengers with reservations for travel through Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit and other cities are eligible to reschedule their flights. AirTran Airways scrubbed 185 flights for Tuesday and has canceled another 75 flights on Wednesday, spokesman Christopher White said. AirTran passengers traveling through two dozen cities in the region -- including Chicago, St. Louis and Boston -- can change their reservation without penalty. Delta Air Lines canceled 625 flights for Tuesday and was grounding at least 800 more for Wednesday. Ahead of the storm, Delta issued a winter weather advisory for the northern United States. Passengers traveling to airports in 20 states through Friday can reschedule their itineraries without a fee or get a refund if their flights are canceled or significantly delayed. Continental Airlines, which canceled 650 flights, will allow changes for travel to, through and from nearly three dozen airports, including the airline's hubs in Newark in New Jersey and Cleveland for travelers scheduled to fly through Thursday. Continental said operations at Newark airport would be suspended through noon Wednesday. US Airways has also relaxed its change-fee policies for passengers scheduled to fly through Thursday to or from 27 cities from Portland, Maine, to Akron, Ohio. Travelers on JetBlue flights to and from six cities and metropolitan areas in the Northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday will also be able to change their plans with no fees. United Airlines, which canceled 800 flights, has issued travel waivers for passengers traveling to, from or through 19 states in the Midwest and Northeast as well as five Canadian cities. Travelers will be able to alter their plans without fees or get a full refund if their flight is canceled.","Airlines cancel thousands of flights for Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- A Norwegian shipping firm has ordered its vessels to avoid the waters off the Horn of Africa and criticized governments for failing to curb a wave of piracy after Somalia-based hijackers seized their largest prize to date. Image taken by the U.S. Navy of pirates leaving a captured merchant vessel in the Gulf of Aden. The decision by the maritime company Odfjell SE means its 90-plus ships will take the additional time and expense to sail around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Suez Canal, a shortcut for mariners for nearly a century and a half. ""It is a huge step, but what we have seen is that the piracy activity in the area has increased,"" the company's president, Terje Storeng, told CNN. ""We have thought about the crew on board the ships and we don't want them to be exposed to this risk of being hijacked any longer."" Storeng said in a statement the company will still sail through the Gulf of Aden only if explicitly committed to doing so by existing contracts. The Gulf of Aden, which lies between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula, is the gateway to the southern Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez Canal. Going around the Cape of Good Hope would add thousands of kilometers to a voyage from the Middle East to Europe or North America.  Map of the new route » . The announcement followed Monday's news that the 300,000-metric-ton oil tanker Sirius Star was captured by pirates in the Indian Ocean over the weekend. The hijacking took place more than 720 km (450 miles) off the Kenyan port of Mombasa, well south of the zone patrolled by international warships in an effort to clamp down on the pirates.  Watch more about the tanker hijacking » . ""This is the furthest out to sea that we've seen any attack, so it's concerning to us,"" Lt. Nathan Christensen, a U.S. Navy spokesman in Bahrain, told CNN. ""The pirates are certainly expanding their ability to attack ships out to sea."" The 330-meter (1,080-foot) ship, owned by a subsidiary of the Saudi Aramco oil company, was headed for an anchorage off the Somali coast early Tuesday. The pirates typically hold the crews hostage and attempt to extract a ransom from the owners of the vessels. The hijacking of the Sirius Star, which launched earlier this year, is part of a recent upsurge of attacks off east Africa, according to the International Maritime Bureau. The attacks are spreading farther north to the Gulf of Aden and farther south off the Kenyan coast, said Noel Choong, who heads the bureau's Piracy Reporting Center, which monitors attacks around the world from its base in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ""The risks are low and the returns are extremely high for these pirates,"" Choong told CNN. Pirates know that their chances of getting killed or captured during a hijacking are very low, he said. The IMB issued a warning November 14 about the possibility of attacks south of Somalia, Choong said. The next day, pirates hijacked the Sirius Star. The oil tanker, known in the industry as a ""very large crude carrier,"" was following the route around the Cape of Good Hope when it was attacked because it was too big to go through the Suez with a full load, said Arthur Bowring, managing director of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association. ""These pirates seem to be incredibly well-equipped and very well armed and very well informed about shipping,"" Bowring told CNN. ""They would appear to be able to go anywhere to get these tankers."" The Sirius Star is the largest vessel ever to be attacked by pirates, Choong said. It is carrying a crew of 25, from Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland, and Saudi Arabia. Odfjell's president said the detour around the cape will take between six and 12 days longer than going through the Suez. Storeng would not say how much extra the deviation would cost, though he said Odfjell would ask its customers to contribute to the extra cost. ""On the other hand, we will not pay the duties to pass the Suez Canal,"" he said. ""That's quite an expensive canal passage. The duties there are quite heavy."" Odfjell operates a fleet of chemical carriers, and similar ships have been among those hijacked in recent months. In its statement, the Norwegian company said it was ""frustrated"" by what it called the ""limited interest"" shown in securing the high seas. ""The efforts that are being made do not seem to put an effective end to what can best be described as ruthless, high-level organized crime,"" Storeng said. Storeng said the company has suffered one attack, about a month ago in the same area, but the captain and crew managed to deflect the pirates by using the ship's firefighting system. He said Odfjell prefers to travel with escort vessels instead of hiring private on-board security. ""We feel that taking on board a ship armed people, and having the risk of shooting at the chemical tankers with explosive cargos on board, is not a good idea,"" he told CNN. ""We don't want to have a big blow-up. We prefer to have escort of naval ships as compared to having people on board to protect us with guns. We don't feel that is a good option."" But the U.S.-led naval mission that patrols the Horn of Africa said successful attacks have decreased in recent weeks. Russian and British warships have fended off pirate attacks on commercial shipping in the past week, authorities in those countries have reported. Some experts say the area is too vast to be successfully patrolled by government or military ships, and that pirates take advantage of it. -- CNN's David McKenzie in Nairobi, Kenya, and Caroline Faraj in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.","Odfjell: Ships will take additional time, expense to sail around south of Africa .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Flights into Thailand have been thrown into chaos Wednesday after explosions at two Bangkok airports wounded four people and triggered the closure of its main international gateway -- a major hub in the region for travelers, authorities said. Passengers face a long wait inside Suvarnabhumi airport with most flights canceled. The blasts come a day after thousands of anti-government protesters stormed the airports to protest the return of Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat from the APEC summit in Peru. One blast occurred at Suvarnabhumi Airport at 5 a.m. (2200 Tuesday GMT), an airport official said. One person was wounded in that attack. Continued protests caused authorities to cancel all incoming and outgoing flights there, an assistant to airport director Serirat Prasutanond told CNN. Three protesters also entered the airport's control tower, demanding the prime minister's flight schedule, The Associated Press quoted Group Capt. Chokchai Saranon, a control tower official, as saying. As the airport had been shut down, there were no controllers in the tower, AP reported.  Watch what's behind protesters' demands » . The other blast occurred at 6:40 a.m. Wednesday (2340 Tuesday GMT) at the Don Muang International Airport, wounding three people, police said. Suvarnabhumi Airport later canceled all flights, AP reported. On Tuesday thousands of anti-government protesters partially shut down Suvarnabhumi Airport, the country's main airport, an airport spokesman said.  Watch fists fly in the terminal » . Pro- and anti-government protesters also exchanged gunfire, a Thai police official said. Protesters with golf clubs and long wooden sticks also clashed with airport taxi drivers, with each side throwing things at the other. The clash started when the anti-government group People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) was mobilizing supporters near the Don Muang airport, which the government is using as its temporary office. iReport.com: Are you there? Send pics, video . The PAD ran into a pro-government group, resulting in an exchange of abusive words, and the pro-government group threw rocks into the PAD crowd prompting an exchange of gunfire, the police official said. The PAD has been leading protests against the government since May, accusing the government of being a front for ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Protesters surrounded the parliament building on Monday, forcing lawmakers to postpone their session. Thaksin was ousted in a bloodless coup in 2006, only to return after the People Power Party won elections in December 2007 . He left again in August of this year, shortly before he was to face trial on corruption charges. In October Thailand's Supreme Court ruled that Thaksin had abused his powers while in office and sentenced the absent former leader to two years in prison. The case was one of several lodged against Thaksin, who protesters want to return to Thailand to face trial. Thaksin stayed in the United Kingdom for much of this year before British authorities revoked his visa. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report. Copyright 2008 CNN.

"(CNN)  -- A Louisiana appeals court ruled it was too early to consider a motion to release a black teenager who allegedly took part in beating up a white classmate in Jena, Louisiana, last year. Mychal Bell, 17, is accused with five others of severely beating Justin Barker in a school fight. The Tuesday ruling is the latest turn in the racially charged saga of a group known as the Jena 6 -- six black teens initially charged with attempted murder after they allegedly knocked out classmate Justin Barker and stomped him during a school fight. Five of the teens were charged as adults. Civil rights groups and other organizations have marshaled thousands of people to march on Jena on Thursday, a day originally slated for 17-year-old Mychal Bell's sentencing hearing on battery and conspiracy convictions. However, a district judge earlier this month tossed out Bell's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree battery, saying the matter should have been handled in the juvenile court. On Friday, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Lake Charles, Louisiana, did the same with Bell's battery conviction. A three-judge panel ruled Tuesday, however, that it would not consider a motion to free Bell from prison. ""The motion for release from custody, filed by the defendant in this court, is premature,"" the panel ruled without setting a date for considering the motion. The future of Bell's case is up to the district attorney, who must decide whether to refile the charges in juvenile court, Bell's attorney Bob Noel said last week. Charges against four of the teens -- Bell, Carwin Jones, Theodore Shaw and Robert Bailey -- have been reduced to battery and conspiracy. Shaw and Jones have not gone to trial. Bailey has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his trial is scheduled for November 26. Bryant Purvis and an unidentified juvenile remain charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Advocates of the Jena 6 say the story began well before the December 4 beating. They say it began in September when three white students decided to hang nooses from a tree on campus. In September 2006, a black student asked the vice principal if he and some friends could sit under an oak tree where white students typically congregated. Told by the vice principal they could sit wherever they pleased, the student and his pals sat under the sprawling branches of the shade tree in the campus courtyard. The next day, students arrived at school to find three nooses hanging from those branches. According to The Town Talk in nearby Alexandria, the school's principal recommended expulsion for those behind the nooses. Instead, the newspaper reported, a school district committee suspended three white students for three days for hanging the nooses, a gesture written off as a ""prank."" Racial tensions flared. The district attorney was summoned to address the student body. Off-campus fights were reported. On November 30, someone torched the school's main academic building. The arson remains unsolved, but many suspect it was linked to the discord. Four days after the arson, several students jumped Barker, knocking him unconscious before stomping and kicking him. Parents of the Jena 6 say they heard Barker was hurling racial epithets. Barker's parents insist he did nothing to provoke the beating. Barker was taken to a hospital with injuries to both eyes and ears as well as cuts. His right eye had blood clots, said his mother, Kelli Barker. He was treated and released that day. Bails for the Jena 6 were set at between $70,000 and $138,000. All but Bell posted bond. The judge has refused to lower his $90,000 bail, citing Bell's criminal record, which includes four juvenile offenses -- two simple battery charges among them.

"(CNN) -- Alvaro Quiros triumphed at the Qatar Masters on Sunday when the Spaniard finished three shots clear of former champion Henrik Stenson and Louis Oosthuizen. Spaniard Quiros clinched his third European Tour title and now looks set for a first appearance at the Masters. The 26-year-old survived a late scare to card a final-round of three-under-par 69 and finish at 19-under 269 -- a showing that sends him into the world top 30 and opens the door for his Masters debut at Augusta in April. Swede Stenson's three-putt bogey at the last for a 68 allowed South African overnight leader Oosthuizen to share second with the 2006 champion after a final round of 71. Stenson, last year's runner-up to Adam Scott, snatched the lead at 16 under with an eagle at the 10th, but Quiros and Oosthuizen -- playing a group behind -- responded with birdies of their own to leave all three tied through 11. The momentum swung Quiros' way as he birdied the 12th and Oosthuizen dropped a shot to fall two off the pace before the Spaniard extended his lead as he converted from eight feet a hole later. Stenson put pressure on with birdie of his own at 15 to move within one at 17 under before Quiros wobbled as he sent his three-wood approach from the rough into the water. Quiros eventually holed from 15-foot putt for bogey, but then birdied 16 and 17 to take a two-stroke lead down the last and claim a third European Tour title. Oosthuizen had birdied the last to record a second successive runner-up finish, which sees him move up to fifth on the season money list -- a place ahead of Stenson. Ireland's Damien McGrane carded a bogey-free 67 for fourth at 13 under, while Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez's three birdies earned him a 69 and a share of fifth with Dutchman Maarten Lafeber (72). World number two Sergio Garcia (70) had a share of seventh place at 11 under.","Spaniard Alvaro Quiros triumphed by three strokes at the Qatar Masters .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- A high-level Kenyan delegation has agreed with the International Criminal Court to set up a tribunal by July 2010 to prosecute those who instigated last year's devastating post-election violence. Residents of a Nairobi slum shout during clashes between two rival groups in January 2008. Failing that, the government in Kenya will refer the case to the court's prosecutor to take over. The delegation, in a signed agreement with chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, also agreed to provide the court with a report on the current status of investigations and prosecutions so it can carry out ""preliminary examinations"" of the case. The violence that erupted in Kenya following a disputed election in December 2007 nearly tore apart an African country once considered an island of peace in an otherwise troubled region that includes Somalia. Nearly 1,500 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced after the re-election of Mwai Kibaki. The opposition, led by Raila Odinga, and many independent observers, said the vote had been rigged. Under pressure from abroad and the region, former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan helped hammer out an agreement that led to a coalition government of all major political parties. A key part of the deal was the forming of a tribunal to investigate and prosecute the leaders responsible for the violence. Annan promised to hand over a list of suspects to the court, should the Kenyan government not form a tribunal. He gave August as a deadline. The court's agreement with Kenya now gives the government breathing room. A U.N. special investigator, in a report issued in June, called for the resignation of top Kenyan officials and sweeping changes in the country's security forces to end reported unlawful killings by police nationwide. The report called for the resignation of Kenya's attorney general and the immediate replacement of the police commissioner. It also said Kibaki should publicly acknowledge his commitment to ending unlawful killings by police. The Kenya government expressed its ""deep displeasure"" and ""grave concern"" with the report, saying it impinged on the country's sovereignty. The U.N. investigator also advocated creating an independent civilian police oversight body, and said the International Criminal Court should investigate violence after the 2007 election. He urged the government to create a witness protection program as well. Many analysts who follow Kenya think the next general election in 2012 has a significant chance of descending into violence, should key government reforms not be put in place.","Violence after December 2007 elections nearly tore Kenya apart .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev announced Wednesday that their countries will soon begin negotiations on reducing their nuclear arsenals, according to a joint statement from the two leaders. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and President Obama talk Wednesday in London ahead of the G-20. The announcement came after Obama and Medvedev met in London ahead of Thursday's G-20 summit. The statement said the two leaders agreed that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms -- which expires in December -- ""has completely fulfilled its intended purpose and that the maximum levels for strategic offensive arms recorded in the treaty were reached long ago."" ""They have therefore decided to move further along the path of reducing and limiting strategic offensive arms in accordance with U.S. and Russian obligations under Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,"" the joint statement said.  Watch Obama and Medvedev meet » . Negotiators from both countries will soon begin talks ""to work out a new, comprehensive, legally binding agreement on reducing and limiting strategic offensive arms to replace the START Treaty,"" the statement said. Earlier, two senior Obama administration officials said another goal of the president's meeting with Medvedev was to set a date for a U.S.-Russian summit in Moscow, Russia, this summer. The joint statement said negotiators from both countries would report their progress on working out the new nuclear arsenal reduction agreement by July. ""The new agreement will mutually enhance the security of the parties and predictability and stability in strategic offensive forces, and will include effective verification measures drawn from the experience of the parties in implementing the START Treaty,"" the statement said. In a joint news conference Wednesday with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown -- ahead of his talks with Medvedev -- Obama emphasized that Russia and the United States also have a common interest in ""reducing nuclear stockpiles and promoting nuclear non-proliferation"" across the world.  Watch Obama, Brown statement ahead of world stage » . ""One of the things I have always believed strongly is that both the United States and Russia and other nuclear powers will be in a much stronger position to strengthen what has become a somewhat fragile thread-bare nonproliferation treaty if we are leading by example and if we can take serious steps to reduce the nuclear arsenal,"" Obama said. ""I think people on both sides of the Atlantic understand that as much as the constant cloud, the threat of nuclear warfare has receded since the Cold War, that the presence of these deadly weapons, their proliferation, the possibility of them finding their way into the hands of terrorists, continues to be the gravest threat to humanity. What better project to start off than seeing if we can make progress on that front. I think we can."" The U.S. president said there's been a rift in the past several years in the U.S.-Russian relationship.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Private military contractor Blackwater USA ""delayed and impeded"" a congressional probe into the 2004 killings of four of its employees in Falluja, Iraq, the House Oversight Committee said Thursday in a report. Family members of the slain Blackwater employees listen during a congressional hearing earlier this year. Blackwater contractors Jerry Zovko, Scott Helvenston, Mike Teague and Wesley Batalona were ambushed, dragged from their vehicles and killed on March 31, 2004. The burned and mutilated remains of two of the men were hung from a bridge over the Euphrates River, an image that fueled American outrage and triggered the first of two attempts to retake the city from Sunni Arab insurgents. The company stalled the committee's investigation into the incident by ""erroneously claiming"" documents related to the incident were classified, trying to get the Defense Department to make previously unclassified documents classified and ""asserting questionable legal privileges,"" according to a report from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's Democratic staff. According to Blackwater's reports on the killings, the men killed in Falluja had been sent into the area without proper crew, equipment or even maps. One company document found a ""complete lack of support"" for its Baghdad, Iraq, office from executives at the company's headquarters in North Carolina, the committee report states. ""According to these documents, Blackwater took on the Falluja mission before its contract officially began, and after being warned by its predecessor that it was too dangerous. It sent its team on the mission without properly armored vehicles and machine guns. And it cut the standard mission team by two members, thus depriving them of rear gunners,"" the report states. In a written response to the report, Blackwater called it ""a one-sided version of this tragic incident."" ""What the report fails to acknowledge is that the terrorists determined what happened that fateful day in 2004,"" the company said. ""The terrorists were intent on killing Americans and desecrating their bodies. Documents that the committee has in its possession point out that the Blackwater team was betrayed and directed into a well-planned ambush."" The report notes that members of the now-defunct Iraqi Civil Defense Corps ""led the team into the ambush, facilitated blocking positions to prevent the team's escape, and then disappeared."" Blackwater did not discuss details of the report's findings, noting the incident is still the subject of a lawsuit by the slain contractors' families. The committee's chairman, California Democrat Henry Waxman, has scheduled a hearing Tuesday on Blackwater's operations in Iraq. The company's chairman, Erik Prince, is scheduled to testify at that hearing. The committee previously disclosed that the day before the fatal mission, the manager of Blackwater's Baghdad office warned his bosses he lacked armored vehicles, radio gear and ammunition. During February's hearing and in a subsequent written response, Blackwater general counsel Andrew Howell told the committee that documents on the attack had been classified by the U.S. government. But the Pentagon later told the committee the documents had not been classified. In addition, Blackwater made ""multiple attempts"" to get the Defense Department to declare company and Coalition Provisional Authority reports on the incident classified, the report states. The Pentagon refused. The families of the slain men have sued Blackwater Security Consulting, one of the most familiar of hundreds of private military contractors operating in Iraq. The families allege the company failed to provide their relatives with adequate gear and weaponry. Blackwater has denied the allegations and argued the men agreed to assume the risks of working in a war zone. Thursday's report adds to the intense scrutiny the company has faced since it was involved in shootings September 16 in western Baghdad. Iraqi authorities said Blackwater guards protecting a U.S. Embassy convoy opened fire indiscriminately, killing as many as 20 civilians. Blackwater said its employees responded properly to an insurgent attack on the convoy. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte on Thursday told a Senate committee that ""something went tragically wrong"" in the Baghdad incident, and that the State Department and Iraqi authorities are conducting a thorough investigation. He said Blackwater guards had fired their weapons on 56 of the 1,873 escort missions they have conducted in Iraq in 2007, ""And each such incident is reviewed by management officials to ensure that procedures were followed."" ""I personally was grateful for the presence of my Blackwater security detail, largely comprised of ex-Special Forces and other military, when I served as ambassador to Iraq,"" Negroponte told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday in response to questions. ""Their alert and controlled posture kept me safe -- to get my job done."" E-mail to a friend .","House probe: Blackwater tried to delay, impede investigation into 2004 killings .

"(CNN) -- The Southeast is among the areas of the United States with the highest concentration of cases of HIV and AIDS, according to a new online tool called the National HIV/AIDS Atlas. In this map of AIDS prevalence rates in the Southeast, red represents the highest (0.593 percent or greater). AIDS experts in the region say that access to health care, especially when it comes to screening, is a major problem in rural communities. In the Southeast, people with HIV tend to get tested late, after they have become sick, partly because of stigma, said Kathie Hiers, executive director of AIDS Alabama in Birmingham. ""If you look at access to health care and almost any kind of health care report card, the South is the worst,"" she said. With little or no public transportation, people in non-metropolitan areas are at a disadvantage when they need to see a particular kind of doctor, experts say. There is also a shortage of doctors who deal with HIV in the region, Hiers said. These problems also resonate with Georgia's rural communities, which represent 39 percent of the HIV/AIDS burden in the state, said Raphael Holloway, director of the HIV Unit at the Georgia Division of Public Health. The remaining 61 percent of people living with HIV or AIDS are in the metro Atlanta area. ""In some districts, for example, there may be 10 counties within that health district but only one infectious disease doctor that people can access for care and services,"" he said. It is also difficult to get HIV education to people in rural areas, he said. Of the 29 states reporting county-level data for the National HIV/AIDS Atlas, Georgia had more counties than any other state with the highest levels of HIV and AIDS prevalence. Although this does not represent a comprehensive national assessment, Georgia ranked fifth in reporting of new AIDS cases in 2007, behind Texas (fourth), Florida (third), New York (second) and California (first), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Northeast also has a heavy burden of HIV/AIDS cases nationally, atlas collaborators said. Other states with high numbers of counties with high HIV prevalence included Florida, New York and South Carolina. The atlas, the first of its kind to map out HIV and AIDS at the level of counties, launched in time for Saturday's HIV/AIDS Testing Day. The National Institutes of Health is encouraging everyone age 13 to 64 to get tested for HIV as part of routine health care. ""Not knowing one's HIV status endangers one's health and the health of one's sexual partners. By getting tested for the virus and learning one's HIV status soon after infection, treatment can begin early, substantially delaying the development of HIV-related illness and prolonging life,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. The National HIV/AIDS Atlas allows users to explore the prevalence of HIV and AIDS in any region of the United States. The map, a project of the National Minority Quality Forum, encompasses all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The more red a region appears, the greater the prevalence, which is the ratio of the number of people living with the disease at a given time to the total number of people living there at that time. Users can look at rates of disease by gender, race/ethnicity and age group in regions where this information is available. The map also has different settings for HIV and AIDS, the more severe illness caused by the HIV virus. They can also zoom into counties and, for New York City only, ZIP codes. About 33 million people have HIV/AIDS worldwide as of 2007, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC estimates that 1.1 million Americans have HIV and that 56,300 new infections occurred in the United States in 2006. Nearly 75 percent of HIV/AIDS diagnoses among adolescents and adults in that year were for males. People who worked on the atlas project were surprised at how concentrated HIV and AIDS are in certain U.S. counties. ""Being able to look at all the data in this way reminds us that the HIV epidemic is not uniformly distributed throughout the U.S.,"" said Patrick Sullivan, associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University, who collaborated on the atlas. The atlas also reflects the disproportionate number of African-Americans who have HIV and AIDS. ""You can see at the level of the national map that there's so much variation in the U.S. about which groups have been impacted,"" Sullivan said. Demographics and county-level data are not available for some states, or parts of some states, because of the way these places report data by region, researchers said. These areas appear as gray when users zoom in. Some places also appear gray because the disease case count is so low. The atlas is based on data from public health departments from 2006, the most recent available. Collaborators say they hope to update the maps when new data become available. The atlas, which launched Monday morning, had about 100,000 visitors by Tuesday afternoon, and more than 10,000 people completed the free registration in that time, said Gary Puckrein, executive director of the atlas project.

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN)  -- South Africans voted Wednesday in elections that the ruling African National Congress is expected to win in a landslide. A woman votes in a church in Soweto during Wednesday's elections. But the ANC, led by Jacob Zuma, could see its two-thirds parliamentary majority reduced by the country's numerous opposition parties. The ANC has increased its share of the vote in every election since the end of apartheid in 1994. Leading the opposition challenge is Congress of the People, or Cope; a breakaway faction of the ANC which has capitalized as the ANC has been dogged by corruption and accused of failing to deliver services to the poor. ""People are taking this election very seriously,"" said CNN's Robyn Curnow. ""It's a pivotal election and the political landscape in this country has changed because of the emergence of the Cope party.""  Voter shares feelings about ANC and new rival » . Voters stood in line for hours after a slow start, blamed partly on cold weather. Polling stations closed at 1900 GMT but anyone in line at the time was allowed to vote. The Independent Electoral Commission said the sheer number of people voting created long lines and a shortage of ballot boxes and papers in some districts and voting stations. The ANC's prospects have not been helped by the controversial election of Zuma to the party leadership last year. Until early this month, Zuma, who is practically the country's president-in-waiting, was facing fraud and corruption charges. The charges were dropped two weeks before the elections because of alleged political interference in his case. That decision by the country's prosecuting authority sparked widespread outrage, with opposition parties accusing prosecutors of buckling under political pressure. But the ANC continues to command widespread respect and support among ordinary South Africans for its role in the struggle against apartheid and most consider the party of Nelson Mandela their political home. In an effort to shore up support for the ANC, the 90-year-old Mandela shared the stage with Zuma at the party's final pre-election rally in Johannesburg on Sunday. Mandela was also photographed as he voted Wednesday.  Watch Mandela vote with old activists and first-time voters » . First-time voter Lucas Nomblelani, a young black South African sporting the purple ink on his thumb that proved he had cast his ballot, said he found it hard not consider what the ANC had done for the country. ""Those people -- they fight for us,"" he told CNN. ""I'm here, I can vote. I don't have the soldiers here to force me to do something."" He adds, ""Now we are free, all of us, to do what we want to do. It's my choice to vote today."" Still, the emergence of Cope has unnerved the ANC. Learn more about some of South Africa's political parties . Launched in December, Cope is made up of former ANC members who quit following ANC's sacking of Thabo Mbeki as the country's president. ""It is a baby with teeth. We can bite and I do believe the people of South Africa have heard our message,"" Cope presidential candidate Mvume Dandala said Wednesday, according to Reuters.com. Zuma, who is widely expected to be the country's next president, has already pledged his party will use its predicted majority responsibly and maintains he is innocent of corruption allegations. ""When I grew up, I did know that this day would come,"" he said as he voted in his village birthplace of Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal, Reuters.com reported.  Watch more about ANC leader Jacob Zuma » . In the past 15 years, the ANC has built 2.8 million houses and provided running water, sanitation and electricity to the poor. South Africa boasts a robust constitution and the strongest economy on the continent. Yet more than 1 million people still live in shacks, and the newly constructed homes have been found to be substandard, with many falling apart even before being handed over to beneficiaries. Queuing up to vote in Soweto, Lulu Makapela said many people were disappointed by the ANC's failure to deliver on promises to deliver better housing, education and jobs. ""People have been giving us promises and there is a wide gap between rich and poor,"" Makapela told CNN.  Watch a voter in line discuss the election » . Although the country's economy has grown under the ANC, it has not produced significant job opportunities. One in four adults is unemployed. At the same time, many senior members of the ANC have created wealth for themselves while majority of the country's citizens wallow in poverty.  Watch criticism of the ruling ANC » . Violent crime has also escalated. Last year, nearly 50 people were killed daily, according to police. And though South Africa won the bid to host the Football World Cup in 2010, many say that the billions that are being spent on the tournament could be better used to lift the lives of the needy.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As absentee ballots pour in from U.S. troops overseas, officials are voicing concerns that many of those votes won't be counted. An absentee ballot from Arlington County in Virginia shows the names of the general election candidates. ""It's dismal,"" said Rosemary Rodriguez, who works for the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission, a non-partisan group. ""These are the voters that are in some cases preserving our liberties and out there with their lives on the line."" Rodriguez estimates that in the last general election, only about 30 percent of overseas military ballots were actually returned and counted. ""It's disenfranchising our military and frankly I think it's very unpatriotic,"" said retired Navy Lt. Melissa Cox Boss. A part of the problem is that each state has its own rules for absentee voting, and those rules can change in the middle of an election season. In Virginia, for example, the federal write-in ballot required a witness' signature and address. That proved confusing for soldiers overseas because there was no box provided for a witness address. Rokey Suleman, the Fairfax County registrar, initially said he would have to discard 63 votes because voters neglected to provide a witness address. ""These ballots that aren't being met -- I can't accept as valid ballots at this point. If the law changes, I welcome a review of the law. I think the law is horrible,"" he said. Late Monday, Virginia's attorney general agreed, saying all county registrars could ignore that part of the law. Other areas, like Arlington County, refused to disqualify the absentee ballots that were filled out improperly, contributing to the the AG's decision to intervene. Another part of the problem is that delivering mail from a battlefield can be challenging, according to Rep. Kevin McCarthy. McCarthy, R-California, says absentee ballots mailed from war zones are not getting to county registrars fast enough to be legally counted. ""With all the modernization that we have, we should be able to move these ballots, track them at the same time, bring the modernization and technology we have today to make sure our heroes across this world get treated fairly,"" he said. McCarthy said he is pushing a bill through Congress that would address these issues, but not in time for this election. Overseas absentee ballots were at the center of the Florida recount during the 2000 presidential election between George Bush and Al Gore. Bush aides and Republican surrogates blasted their Democratic rivals for having overseas absentee ballots disqualified in Florida counties, many for lack of postmarks. Many of those ballots were presumed to have been from service members supporting Bush. Joe Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, denied that charge and said that the disputed votes deserve the ""benefit of doubt."" ""[Gore] and I would never authorize and would not tolerate a campaign that was aimed specifically at invalidating ballots from members of our armed services, and I've been assured that there were more absentee ballots from non-military voters that were ultimately disqualified,"" he said during an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" More than a month after the election, the Florida Supreme Court upheld two state court rulings that cleared the way to count thousands of ballots in predominantly Republican Seminole and Martin counties.","States' rules for absentee ballots vary; rules can change during election season .

"(CNN) -- Saturday saw protests across the United States, held to express solidarity with the anti-government demonstrations currently roiling Egypt. Whether on the East Coast or the West Coast, crowds carried banners, flags and signs as they chanted, hoping their support could be felt thousands of miles away in Cairo, Alexandria and other Egyptian cities. In San Francisco, demonstrators gathered at a corner on Market Street and quickly packed the sidewalk, waving Egyptian and American flags. Participants seemed to represent a rainbow of backgrounds and ages.  There were elderly couples, teenagers and children with Egypt's colors painted on their faces. Many Egyptian-Americans were there, enlivening the chants with Arabic phrases. But plenty of people of Latin, Caucasian and Asian descent also turned out to march, support Egyptian demonstrators and demand the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak. Among the call-and-response chants came a reference to recent protests in Tunisia: ""Oh Mubarak, can't you see? Time to join Ben Ali."" In Seattle, traditional Egyptian melodies were heard among the chants and slogans. One man who led the chorus of old songs was impressed by the Egyptian movement's use of social media. ""Thanks to new technology and new communications, the people from Facebook and Twitter, we are able to come together and make this happen. All the young people ... they feel like sometimes there is no chance. But you see this and think ... there is a chance."" There was a small demonstration in Texas outside the Egyptian Consulate building in Houston. It seemed to be a family affair, with small children flashing peace signs as their families waved flags and signs.  ""They need everyone to hear them,"" one demonstrator told CNN affiliate KIAH. ""That's the only way we can get change. It's not going to come from within, it's going to come from outside. That's why we're out here now."" Egyptian-Americans gathered in Toledo, Ohio, too. They waved Egyptian flags and carried signs that read ""Defend Democracy"" and ""Defend Human Rights."" Although only a handful of people braved the cold, nearly every passing car honked in support. On the East Coast, hundreds gathered outside the United Nations in New York. They held up signs that read: ""Mubarak Regime MUST GO,"" ""Egypt's Struggle Is Our Struggle!"" and ""Egypt -- We Hear You!"" Meanwhile, they yelled out in unison, ""Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! Mubarak must go!"" Sharif Sadek, a young Egyptian-American filmmaker in the New York crowd, said the ouster of the Egyptian leader is the only acceptable outcome. He urged U.S. leaders to make this happen. ""The United States can urge Mubarak to step down and leave the country. Go to Switzerland. Go to South Africa. Go to the moon. We do not want President Mubarak,"" Sadek said. In Washington, protesters assembled outside the Egyptian Embassy before heading to the White House. One protester held up a cardboard sign that read: ""Pharaoh! Let the people go!"" Sam Abouissa, a protest organizer who said his brothers were arrested in Egypt while protesting, said he walked door-to-door in the capital to solicit support from fellow Egyptians. ""We need freedom. We need freedom on the Internet. Freedom of communications. Freedom of expressing our opinion. Freedom of life. Freedom of choice,"" Abouissa said. ""We have to choose.

"(CNN) -- Architecture buffs savor Chicago's buildings, but you don't have to be a connoisseur to appreciate the city's masonry and steel marvels. Some of America's most influential architects worked in the Windy City. The Chicago Architecture Foundation conducts more than 70 different kinds of tours and expects to lead more than 200,000 people through various corners of the city this year. Chicago's reputation for world-class architecture took root during an 1880s building boom, spurred by the city's rapid growth as a transportation hub. The Great Fire of 1871 destroyed much of the city's original construction and set the stage for innovation. CNN asked Jason Neises, the foundation's director of tours, to give us some highlights of Chicago's rich architectural history: . THE CHICAGO RIVER: BIRTH OF A CITY . ""The Chicago River is really the centerpiece of the whole city, and it's the reason why Chicago is here -- this transportation network that allowed Chicago to grow into a world-class city,"" Neises said. Much of the city's best architecture -- both historic and modern -- can be seen along the river, making river cruises a top draw for tourists.  See a gallery of Chicago's architectural highlights » . Don't miss: . The Wrigley Building and the Tribune Tower (at Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive) were built in the 1920s to house the Wrigley chewing gum company and the Chicago Tribune. 333 West Wacker Drive, completed in 1983, features a wall of green glass that curves to follow a bend in the Chicago River. DANIEL BURNHAM (1846-1912): CITY PLANNER . Burnham was an influential early Chicago architect but is most notable for his 1909 Plan for Chicago and its lasting influence on urban planning. ""Even in modern Chicago in 2007, people think about his plan when looking to do new things in the city,"" Neises said. Early in his career, Burnham worked with William Le Baron Jenney, who is known as the ""father of the skyscraper"" for his work with metal-frame construction. Later, Burnham and his partner, John Wellborn Root, built a number of buildings in what became known as the Chicago commercial style, which used metal framework to allow for taller buildings with larger windows and more open floor plans. Don't miss: . The Rookery (1885-88), 209 S. LaSalle St. This building, designed by Burnham and Root, uses both load-bearing masonry and metal-frame construction, tracing the evolution of commercial architecture. Santa Fe Building (1904), 224 S. Michigan Ave. Designed by D.H. Burnham and Co., the building is the former home of Burnham's own offices and now houses the Chicago Architecture Foundation. It's a mature version of the Chicago commercial style that developed in the 1880s. LAKEFRONT PARKS: TESTAMENT TO FORESIGHT . The lakefront parks were protected from commercial development from the city's earliest days and incorporated by Daniel Burnham into his 1909 city plan, creating one of the most unique and enjoyable aspects of Chicago's urban landscape. Don't miss: . Grant Park, south of the Chicago River, is the centerpiece of the park system. The expanse is home to the 1927 Buckingham Fountain and several of Chicago's top museums, and it hosts many of the city's popular festivals. LOUIS SULLIVAN (1856-1924): AMERICAN VISION . Sullivan, one of America's most influential architects, rejected the tradition of copying historic European styles and worked instead to develop uniquely American buildings. Sullivan believed that buildings should look organic and in harmony with their environment, and he developed the ""form follows function"" philosophy. Don't miss: . The Auditorium Building (1886-1890), 430 S. Michigan Ave., was designed to house a theater, a hotel and offices, and is widely recognized as Sullivan and his partner Dankmar Adler's masterpiece. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT (1867-1959): DESIGN REVOLUTION . Wright, widely considered to be the greatest architect of the 20th century, started his career in Chicago working first for Joseph Lyman Silsbee and soon after for Adler and Sullivan. Louis Sullivan was Wright's mentor.  Slide show: Learn more about Frank Lloyd Wright » . Wright developed the Prairie style in the Chicago area, revolutionizing residential architecture. The style is characterized by accentuated horizontal lines and a fluid relationship between a structure and its environment. Don't miss: . Frank Lloyd Wright's home and studio (1889-1898) at 951 Chicago Ave. in Oak Park, Illinois, is open for tours and accessible via public transportation. The Robie House (1909), 5757 S. Woodlawn Ave., is a masterpiece of the Prairie style. ART DECO: JAZZ-AGE AESTHETICS . Chicago's rapid growth in the 1920s and '30s created a need for new office buildings reflective of the jazz-age style. ""This is the era of steam ship travel across the Atlantic and some of the first airplanes and these wonderful, long, streamlined automobiles. And that same design sensibility was translated into architecture,"" Neises said. The resulting buildings were smooth, with little applied ornamentation and an emphasis on unbroken vertical lines. Don't miss: . The Chicago Board of Trade Building (1930), 141 W. Jackson Blvd., designed by Holabird and Root, exemplifies art deco's emphasis on verticality. LUDWIG MIES VAN DER ROHE (1886-1969): EMERGING MODERNISM  Mies van der Rohe's innovation brought Chicago's architecture to the world stage again in the 1940s with his glass and steel highrises. He designed some of the first modernist buildings in the city, embracing modern materials and technology. ""If you're building a steel building, why would you disguise that as a stone building? Celebrate the steel, celebrate modern technology, put materials together artistically in a modern way,"" Neises said, explaining Mies van der Rohe's style. Don't miss: . 860-880 Lake Shore Drive (1949-1951). These glass and steel apartment towers are among the city's most famous post-World War II buildings. CHICAGO MODERNISM: GROWING INFLUENCE . Pioneered by Mies van der Rohe, modernism in Chicago was proliferated in the '50s and '60s by his students and followers. Modernist architects believed that the form, shape and volume of a building, rather than its ornamentation, should express its beauty. These ideas came to dominate commercial and institutional architecture for decades. ""It's a very kind of 'thinky' way of trying to design buildings, which is what's a little bit off-putting for some people,"" Neises said. But this is the reason he enjoys giving the foundation's Modern Skyscrapers tour. ""I can't always get people to like this stuff, but I can get them to appreciate it."" Don't miss: . The Inland Steel Building (1956-57), 30 W. Monroe St. Designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (the same firm that designed the Sears Tower), this dramatic skyscraper clad in stainless steel was the first skyscraper to be built in the Loop after the Great Depression. MILLENNIUM PARK: A NEW ERA . Millennium Park, which opened several years late in 2004, combines art, architecture, music and landscape design to great effect. At Michigan Avenue and Randolph Street, the park has quickly become one of the most popular tourist destinations in Chicago. Don't miss: .

Michel Suleiman, the commander of the Lebanese armed forces in the wake of the Lebanese government losing control of part of its capital to the militant group Hezbollah. The trip had not previously been scheduled. It is not clear when it was added to the agenda of the top U.S. military commander for the region. Discussions centered on continued U.S. military assistance to the Lebanese armed forces in light of the ongoing crisis. ""The U.S. government will continue to support the legitimate institutions of the Lebanese government and the Lebanese people as they seek to preserve their independence and security,"" the military official said. For the last several years, the Defense Department has supplied Lebanese armed forces with ammunition, armored vehicles and weapons. The Lebanese army said Tuesday that it will use force if necessary against armed groups, acting after at least 62 people were killed as anti-government Hezbollah militants battled supporters of Lebanon's pro-Western government while the military largely stayed on the sidelines, declining to intervene. The army reversed its stance Tuesday, saying it would take steps up to and including the use of force in response to ""security activity and military presence,"" an apparent reference to public activity by armed groups. The violence is the worst to hit Lebanon since the end of its civil war in 1991. It started in Beirut, but quickly spread to nearby mountain villages in the Mount Lebanon area and to Tripoli. Pro- and anti-government political parties in Tripoli announced a cease-fire Monday night that seemed to be holding -- at least in the hours immediately after the announcement. Meanwhile, several Western and Middle East nations have lined up to support an Arab League effort to intervene in the political crisis. An Arab League delegation is scheduled to arrive in Lebanon this week in hope of negotiating an agreement between the Lebanese government and the Shiite Hezbollah movement.","Acting commander of U.S. Central Command in Lebanon to discuss security crisis .

"CANKIRI, Turkey (CNN)  -- In the searing heat of an Anatolian afternoon, work continues busily on the vast building site that fills an entire block of Cankiri's otherwise quiet town center. Polls suggest the Erdogan's AKP is heading for another victory. A massive Western-style shopping complex is rising from the ground. Next the local mayor, Irfan Dinc, has plans for a smart new bus terminal on the outskirts of this small regional capital a couple of hours north of Ankara. Designated a ""preferential province,"" investors in Cankiri already receive lucrative tax breaks. Now Dinc hopes to tap into European Union funds as part of his efforts to put the town on the map. ""Cankiri is generally known for being a rural, modest province,"" Dinc tells CNN. ""But we are becoming more integrated. We are connecting Cankiri to the rest of the world."" Cankiri is typical of the Turkish provincial towns and regions that are beginning to emerge from the shadow of Istanbul and Ankara driven by surging economic growth -- and the sort of place where campaigning ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections is at its most fierce. Yet the issue that forced Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan into early elections showed how fragile Turkey's young democracy can still be -- and how a dispute in Ankara's corridors of power can still tip the entire country into political crisis. Erdogan's critics in Turkey's traditional establishment accuse his Justice and Development Party (AKP) of Islamist tendencies and of plotting to dilute the secularist principles of the modern Turkish republic, as laid down by the country's revered founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. That came to a head in April when the government nominated the country's foreign minister, Abdullah Gul, for the presidency. The fact that Gul's wife chooses to wear a headscarf prompted a secularist outcry, with opposition lawmakers backed by the constitutional court blocking the nomination, millions protesting in Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir and even the leaders of the army -- the traditional defenders of secularism -- issuing an e-mail in which they stated their readiness to intervene in the event of the election of a president not to their tastes. In Cankiri, it is hard to see how the headscarf could have become such a potent political symbol. Many women here chose to wear them, but plenty of others don't and life continues harmoniously as it has done for decades in this culturally conservative country. Suat Kiniklioglu, a local AKP parliamentary candidate and one of a new breed of technocratic young politicians attracted by the party's modernizing instincts, told CNN the real divide in Turkey was between ""those who want the old order to continue and those who want the old order to change."" He argues it has been the AKP -- rather than the main opposition Republican Party (CHP) led by veteran politician Deniz Baykal, the self-styled defenders of Ataturk's legacy -- that has argued for closer integration with the European Union and for a globalizing drive that has brought visible benefits to places like Cankiri. ""We represent the people who believe Turkey should open up and that the old ways of doing things no longer work for us. We do not reject secularism -- we just argue for a more user-friendly secularism. We do not think it should matter if a woman chooses to wear a headscarf."" Final polls ahead of Sunday's vote suggest the AKP is heading for another victory, but this is not a straightforward election. The party still faces the job of electing a president and has vowed to press ahead with constitutional changes to prevent a similar crisis occurring again. But without securing an unlikely two-thirds majority, it could find itself blocked by its parliamentary opponents just as easily after the elections as before them. And while the CHP is not expected to get the votes it needs to form a government, the secular establishment remains a dominating presence in Turkish politics, notably through its close ties to the army, which has acted four times since 1960 to bring down governments of which it disapproved. Also damaging for the AKP has been a surge in Turkish nationalism, largely on the back of reaction against regular terrorist attacks by the PKK which have led military chiefs to call for action against Kurdish Northern Iraq. That feeling has been capitalized on effectively by the Nationalist Party (MHP), which may well achieve the 10 percent share of the vote necessary to enter parliament, further shifting the political balance of power. Particularly successful in rural areas, the MHP is challenging strongly in Cankiri -- an AKP stronghold -- to win a place on the list of three MPs the province will send to parliament. For Ibrahim Kalin, an Ankara-based political analyst and newspaper columnist, the main question surrounding Sunday's vote is not who will win, but whether Turkey can return to anything approaching normal politics after a bitterly polarized campaign. ""Politicians are ruining Turkish democracy, they are ruining people's trust in politics, they are ruining people's faith in politicians,"" Kalin told CNN. ""There needs to be a little more calmness, a little bit more of a sense of responsibility for the immediate future. I'm talking two weeks down the road when they come back to parliament and you have a country to run. They have to make some compromises and compromises I think have to begin now.""

"(CNN) -- The mother of a 25-year-old woman killed in a Boston hotel more than a week ago said Friday that she will remain haunted by her daughter's death for the rest of her life. The mother of Julissa Brisman says she remains haunted by her daughter's death. ""Our family has been devastated by the loss of our beautiful daughter, Julissa,"" Carmen Guzman said in a statement released Friday, which would have been Julissa Brisman's 26th birthday. ""The feeling of losing my daughter in this way and the pain she must have felt will haunt me for the rest of my life,"" Guzman said. ""She won't live to see her dreams. We will hold Julissa in our hearts every day."" Philip Markoff, 23, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, is charged with killing Brisman on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Police have said that Brisman, a model from New York, advertised as a masseuse on the online classifieds Web site Craigslist. They say Markoff may have met her through the online site. Prosecutors say Brisman sustained blunt head trauma, and said she was shot three times at close range. One of the bullets passed through her heart, killing her, prosecutors said. Markoff, who was arraigned Tuesday, is being held without bail. His attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is ""not guilty of the charges. He has his family's support. I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom. All I have at the moment are words -- no proof of anything."" A procedural not-guilty plea was entered on Markoff's behalf, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley. Markoff is also charged in connection with the April 10 robbery of Trisha Leffler, 29, at a Westin Hotel in Boston. Leffler was robbed of $800 in cash and $250 in American Express giftcards, according to police reports. She was held at gunpoint and bound, prosecutors said. Megan McAllister, who identified herself as Markoff's fiancee, maintained his innocence in an e-mail sent to ABC News. McAllister said Markoff ""is the wrong man"" and ""was set up."" ""Unfortunately, you were given wrong information as was the public,"" she wrote. ""All I have to say to you is Philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly!"" Authorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said. Authorities in Boston are working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, on what could be a related case. On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney said. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, McCartney said. He said the incident ""may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area"" but that had not been determined.","Mother of Craigslist victim Julissa Brisman says family 'devastated' by loss .

"(CNN) -- The legacy of U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died on Tuesday, spreads far and wide, and across the ocean to now-independent Bangladesh. There, he is still revered for calling attention to what many deemed an unfolding genocide. Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, known as the ""Lion of the Senate,"" died Tuesday at 77. It may have started as a politically prudent move by a Democratic senator eyeing the White House during a Republican regime. But Kennedy stood up to the Nixon administration in 1971 and alerted the world to the bloodshed that was engulfing then-East Pakistan. ""In 1971, there were very few leaders from the so-called free world who were paying any attention to what was going on in Bangladesh. And for Ted Kennedy to come forward and to personally visit, the impact was huge,"" said Akku Chowdhury, founder and director of Bangladesh's Liberation War Museum. ""And that's one thing Bangladeshis have always remembered."" At the time, the U.S. policy -- directed by President Richard Nixon and his National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger -- was to resolutely support Pakistan, from which Bangladesh was trying to secede. The administration's reasons: The Soviet Union and India had just signed a treaty of friendship, and Nixon was concerned about the expansion of Soviet influence in the region. Thus, it made strategic sense for the United States to align itself with India's neighbor, Pakistan. The United States turned a blind eye to reports of atrocities committed by the Pakistani army to suppress the independence movement -- even as U.S. diplomats urged the administration to speak up. ""Our government has failed to denounce the suppression of democracy. Our government has failed to denounce atrocities,"" Consul General Archer Blood wrote in one of many telegrams from Dhaka to the U.S. State Department questioning American policy. ""But we have chosen not to intervene, even morally, on the grounds that the ... conflict, in which unfortunately the overworked term 'genocide' is applicable, is purely an internal matter of a sovereign state."" The ""Blood Telegram,"" as it came to be known, was reclassified as secret, and Blood transferred out of Dhaka. Soon after, Kennedy traveled to east India to gauge the plight of displaced Bangladeshis -- more than 10 million of whom had sought refuge there. On his return, he issued a scathing report to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Refugees. The report, ""Crisis in South Asia,"" spoke of ""one of the most appalling tides of human misery in modern times."" ""Nothing is more clear, or more easily documented, than the systematic campaign of terror -- and its genocidal consequences -- launched by the Pakistani army on the night of March 25th,"" he wrote. ""All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from Islamabad. America's heavy support of Islamabad is nothing short of complicity in the human and political tragedy of East Bengal."" The Nixon administration maintained its stance. But Kennedy's focus on the mass killings came as everyday Americans began to share in the outrage. For instance, Beatle George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh, the first benefit event of its kind, was staged to further highlight the plight of Bangladeshi refugees. Besieged, the U.S. Congress pushed through a bill to ban arms sales to Pakistan. On December 16, 1971, Bangladesh gained independence after a 10-month struggle, in which 1 million to 3 million Bengalis were killed. ""When the fighting was over, there were vultures almost too fat to fly, and Bangladesh was a land with few of the sinews of nationhood left unsevered,"" the National Geographic said in a piece about the birth of the country. Two months later -- in February 1972 -- Kennedy flew to Bangladesh and delivered a speech at Dhaka University, where the killing rampage had begun a year earlier. About 8,000 jubilant students crowded into the university courtyard and jammed lecture hall balconies and roofs, greeting him with chants of ""Joi Kennedy"" -- a variation on the independence slogan of ""Joi Bangla."" In his speech, Kennedy drew parallels between the liberation of Bangladesh and the American Revolution. He said America had prospered despite predictions that it would collapse following independence, and so would Bangladesh. ""Even though the United States government does not recognize you, the people of the world do recognize you,"" Kennedy told the crowd. On the university campus stood a banyan tree where Bengalis student leaders had planted the seeds for the independence movement -- and which the Pakistani army had destroyed as a symbolic gesture. During his visit, Kennedy planted a new tree there. It still stands today -- a testament to a country that overcame long odds to survive and one man who helped champion it.","Kennedy spoke out about Bangladesh when U.S. policy was supporting Pakistan .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Prosecutors dropped corruption charges Monday against South Africa's ruling party president Jacob Zuma, who is expected to win the presidential race later this month. Jacob Zuma is expected to win the country's upcoming presidential election. The leader of the African National Congress had been charged with more than 700 counts of corruption and fraud. The charges, which were linked to a multibillion dollar arms deal in the country, were dropped after eight years of investigations. Zuma, who was named one of Time's Most Influential People in 2008, is favored to win the country's next presidential elections scheduled for April 22. He served as deputy president of South Africa from 1999 until he was fired in 2005 by President Thabo Mbeki over his alleged involvement in a bribery scandal. Opposition parties are accusing prosecutors of buckling under pressure from the ruling party. Mokotedi Mpshe, head of the National Prosecuting Authority, disagreed. ""An intolerable abuse has occurred,"" Mpshe said after reading transcripts of telephone conversations between two prosecution chiefs who appear to be planning to charge Zuma before ANC party elections. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report .","Jacob Zuma is president of the ANC, the most powerful party in South Africa .
