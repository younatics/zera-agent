"Arjen Robben has revealed that Holland's 2010 World Cup final loss to Spain 'still hurts' - and that he will only get over it if he can lift the trophy in Brazil. The Dutch got all the way to the final in South Africa but agonisingly lost 1-0 to Spain in extra time, courtesy of Andres Iniesta's 116th-minute strike. And Robben says that the pain is similar to how he felt when his club side Bayern Munich lost to Chelsea at their home ground, the Allianz Arena, in the 2012 Champions League final before claiming that trophy the following season - with the Dutchman himself scoring the winning goal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arjen Robben discuss Holland's chances against world champions Spain . Pain: Holland winger Arjen Robben says he is not yet over their 2010 World Cup final loss to Spain . Loss: Robben looks devastated after the final whistle in South Africa four years ago and is still hurting now . Crushed: Andres Iniesta's (centre) 116th-minute strike for Spain broke Dutch hearts in the World Cup final . Robben said: ‘The final defeat from 2010 still hurts - it's not something you just get over. 'I experienced something similar with Bayern when we lost the Champions League final against Chelsea. It hurt - and the only cure was putting it right by lifting the trophy. 'That is the only way we will get over the 2010 loss - by going one better this time.' But the 30-year-old winger, who has scored 23 goals in 75 appearances for the Dutch national side, insists tonight's World Cup opener with Spain is not about revenge, but about progressing in the tournament. He said: ‘I don't look at this game against Spain as a chance to get revenge - it isn't about that at all. 'It is just about winning the game and giving us the best chance to progress out of the group - and hopefully even win it.' Dejected: Bastian Schweinsteiger reflects on Bayern Munich's 2012 Champions League loss to Chelsea . Redemption: Robben then scored the winner in the 2013 Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund . My precious: Robben says lifting the World Cup would ease the pain, as did lifting the 2013 Champions League . Robben is also fully behind his coach, newly-appointed Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal, who he believes can take them all the way in Brazil before taking up the reins at Old Trafford. The former Chelsea star continued: ‘He (Van Gaal) has us a very organised team and playing well. 'It was clear why Manchester United wanted him so badly - with Pep he is the best coach in the world and we could not ask for a better national coach.’ New beginnings: Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal will take over at Manchester United after the World Cup .

"They were fighting to win the match for their opposing sides in Sunday's Premier League clash, and it appears Chelsea's Eden Hazard thought that might be taken literally by Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure at half-time. Hazard was caught on camera, via Manchester City's official YouTube channel, looking rather startled as he was slapped on the back of the head by Toure as the two teams were appearing for the start of the second half at the Etihad Stadium. Turning around to see who the culprit was, Hazard's initial anger quickly subsides as he sees the Ivory Coast star smiling back at him - who then attempts to strike him again playfully before they re-enter the pitch.

Frank Lampard scored a late equaliser against his former side to earn Manuel Pellegrini's side a 1-1 draw against Chelsea. Lampard's strike cancelled out Andre Schurrle's second half opener after Pablo Zabaleta had been sent off for the hosts. Speaking after the match Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho admitted the draw was a fair result against the Premier League champions: 'We were winning the game against 10 men, but the same 10 men had a fantastic reaction and gave everything to try to equalise,' he said. 'When the game gets emotional the numbers are not so important. When the game is tactical - yes they are important. 'We scored, we had the game seemingly under control, we hit the post but then they scored.

"Gordon D'Arcy could prove Ireland boss Joe Schmidt's surprise choice to succeed Brian O'Driscoll at outside centre. Ireland's Kiwi coach must quickly solve the conundrum of how best to handle life after record caps-holder O'Driscoll's summer retirement. Connacht's Robbie Henshaw has been widely tipped to fill the void, with O'Driscoll himself joining that clamour. Gordon D'Arcy (left) could replace the retired Brian O'Driscoll (right) as Ireland's outside centre this season . D'Arcy is an inside centre by trade and played with O'Driscoll for years but he could make he switch outside . Head coach Schmidt may well consider sliding O'Driscoll's long-term centre partner from 12 to 13 however, according to former Ireland flanker David Wallace. 'It will be interesting to see how that pans out as there are a lot of guys sticking their hands up for the job,' Wallace said. 'There are also serious thoughts of Gordon D'Arcy moving out there to 13 as well though. 'You look at him and Brian: they are actually very similar players, and Gordon's probably more suited to outside centre naturally anyway. 'It's just that Brian's been there so long that no one was going to move him. 'Maybe you could bring a bigger centre in there, and perhaps Gordon could move across.' Ireland claimed just their second win in Paris in 42 years to claim the RBS 6 Nations crown in O'Driscoll's international farewell last term. The 35-year-old's exit leaves a vast chasm for boss Schmidt to fill, especially with just 12 fixtures left before Rugby World Cup 2015. D'Arcy has refused to speculate on his own future beyond the end of the current campaign, but the 34-year-old is expected to plough on to the World Cup barring injury. Former Ireland flanker David Wallace (pictured) believes that D'Arcy could make the move to outside centre . D'Arcy (second left) and O'Driscoll (right) played together in the centre for both Ireland and Leinster . Former Munster, Ireland and Lions flanker Wallace believes D'Arcy could be the man to slot in at 13, especially to boost the side's defensive shape. 'A lot of guys are putting up their hands: there's Stuart Olding, Luke Marshall, Darren Cave and Jared Payne up in Ulster alone,' said Wallace. 'Then you've got Robbie Henshaw down at Connacht of course. 'So it will be interesting to see how it pans out, because there's a wave of opportunity there. 'Defence is a 15-man game obviously, but Brian was pretty much a coach in defensive regards, he would always keep you honest and keep the line strong. 'From a defensive position it's the most difficult on the pitch, where you're probably most exposed and you've got a huge number of decisions to make. 'So it is a difficult position in that respect, but I think Gordon would certainly be up to the task. 'The biggest challenge for anyone going in there of course, is taking up that mantle. 'Obviously in attack Drico was amazing but not only from game day, seeing his level of precision in training, the demands he made in terms of where he would want you, I learned so much from him. 'He certainly had it all down to a fine art, so that's going to be tough for guys to fill into, but Joe Schmidt will certainly take over that area too.'

"Manu Tuilagi faces a battle to be fit for England’s opening autumn international against the All Blacks after the Leicester centre suffered another groin injury in Saturday's victory over Ulster. He went off after 15 minutes suffering a recurrence of the problem that ruled him out earlier in the season. Director of rugby Richard Cockerill does not expect Tuilagi to be fit for next weekend’s trip to the Scarlets, leaving the 23-year-old a maximum of one match to prove his fitness for the international series which starts on November 8. Graham Kitchener celebrates a first-half try for Leicester Tigers in their win over Ulster at Welford Road . Leicester celebrate as Owen Williams scores their first try in the European Rugby Champions Cup clash . Manu Tuilagi faces a race to be fit for England's opening autumn international against New Zealand . ‘Hopefully it’s not too much of an issue, but it’s not right and that’s a concern for everybody,’ said Cockerill. ‘I can’t comment [on how long he’s going to be out] but you’d imagine it’s not going to be a one-weeker.’ The blow did not stop Leicester silencing their critics in their Champions Cup opener — despite Paddy Jackson kicking the visitors to an early 3-0 lead. Owen Williams filled the void left by Tuilagi and he crashed over for the opening try. Freddie Burns added the extras. Paul Marshall, in for injured Ruan Pienaar, was caught out when Ben Youngs intercepted his pass. The Tigers skipper broke clear and found Graham Kitchener, who slid over for the second try.

"Leicester earned the win they desperately needed on Friday night to avert an early-season crisis but their injury epidemic has claimed another England casualty, with Tom Croft ruled out for six weeks. One step forward, one step back. No sooner had the Tigers ended a run of three consecutive defeats than they were forced to confirm that their England flanker had a knee operation on Thursday and will miss the autumn internationals. Leicester director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, revealed: ‘Crofty’s had a screw taken out of his knee that was irritating the joint. He’s probably six weeks away from playing. It is disappointing for him and us.’ Blaine Scully of Leicester Tigers runs in for the opening try against Harlequins at Welford Road . American winger Blaine Scully slides under the posts to score the first try of the Aviva Premiership match . Croft has long been blighted by injuries. The Lion missed almost the whole of last season after suffering serious knee damage. He was side-lined for half of the previous campaign after major neck surgery. Short bursts of activity are being interrupted by long spells of recuperation. It is a worrying pattern for the 28-year-old. Leicester already had a long injury list, so the loss of another key man is the last thing Cockerill needed. For England, Croft becomes the latest absentee up front, joining the likes of Dan Cole, Alex Corbisiero, Tom Youngs, Geoff Parling and Tom Johnson. This injury bulletin overshadowed a vital win for the embattled Tigers. It wasn’t pretty or emphatic, but the result was all that mattered. They had circled the wagons in the run-up to this match, amid tough questions about Cockerill’s regime, and the siege mentality produced the desired outcome. They tightened their game to suit the grim conditions and a dominant pack saw them through. Blaine Scully’s early try set the nervous home side on their way and the boot of Owen Williams, though erratic at times, contributed the other 17 points. Freddie Burns’ tactical kicking turned the screw on Quins, Mathew Tait excelled at full back and the Tigers were particularly well served by several forwards, led by man of the match Graham Kitchener, Jamie Gibson and Fraser Balmain. Nick Evans of Harlequins kicks over Leicester fly-half Freddie Burns as Charlie Matthews watches on . Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill patrols the touchline of the Midlands ground . The immediate upshot is that Leicester — who came in on the back of defeats to Bath, London Irish and Gloucester — climbed three places to seventh in the table and avoided a first four-game losing run for a decade. Yet, this meant more than just four league points. There was palpable relief at Welford Road as the Tigers did enough to stop the rot and, potentially, generate vital confidence ahead of next week’s start of the new European Champions Cup. Cockerill said: ‘I’m happy for the players and for the club as a whole. We’ve stuck together and this relieves the pressure a bit. But it’s not all fixed yet; it’s just one game. Hopefully, we have come through the other side, but we’ll see in the next few weeks.’ Leicester went ahead with a fourth-minute try, courtesy of a slick counter-attack. Ben Youngs and Manu Tuilagi combined to send Gibson clear out wide and the flanker drew the last defender before releasing Scully to scorch clear and round to the posts. Williams and Nick Evans engaged in a kicking duel for the bulk of a disjointed game until Quins rallied with a late try. Nine minutes from time, the visitors sent a penalty to the left corner, won the lineout, drove repeatedly infield and Karl Dickson stepped through a gap to score. Evans converted and that was enough to snatch a bonus point. Quins boss Conor O’Shea said: ‘We got stuck in the middle of the pitch and they won the kicking contest. We didn’t play in the right areas of the pitch and our lineout didn’t function.’ Welsh fly-half Owen Williams, of Leicester kicks a penalty as the hosts pull ahead .

"Leicester hooker Tom Youngs is the latest player to be ruled out of England’s tour of New Zealand, in order to be with his wife while she is being treated for a serious illness. The 27-year-old will be left out of a 40-man squad to be named later this month and head coach Stuart Lancaster said: ‘Our thoughts are with Tom and Tiffany at this time and it is entirely right that he stays at home to support her and their daughter Maisie.’ While Youngs has been stood down on compassionate grounds, the management have ruled Alex Corbisiero, Tom Croft and Christian Wade out of their disintegrating plans on fitness grounds, even though the first two are set to make comebacks this weekend. Ruled out: Leicester hooker Tom Youngs (centre) will miss this summer's tour to New Zealand . Boost: England coach Stuart Lancaster is sweating over several player injuries . ‘Alex and Tom have worked really hard to come back before the end of the season but they will not have played enough rugby to be considered,’ said Lancaster. ‘It’s the same with Christian Wade.’ The removal of Youngs, along with the serious knee injury suffered by Bath’s Rob Webber and David Paice’s recent lay-off from London Irish duties, has created a significant problem at hooker. The country’s first-choice No 2, Dylan Hartley, has been recovering from a shoulder injury sustained in March. Northampton are still uncertain whether their captain will return to action this weekend or next. And if the Saints reach the Aviva Premiership final, Hartley will not be available for England’s first Test against the All Blacks in Auckland on June 7. That game is increasingly likely to feature a team decimated by the loss of several key players, due to the fixture congestion which means it is taking place seven days after the showpiece culmination of the domestic season. Needs more time: Leciester flanker Tom Croft will also miss out on England's summer tour . Lancaster will be forced to field a savagely weakened line-up, including a fifth or sixth-choice hooker. Dave Ward of Harlequins may find himself pitched into a Test debut against the world champions in the hostile surroundings of Eden Park. The 28-year-old spent three years at Cornish Pirates in the Championship, but he is now poised for an international call. Another contender would be Exeter’s highly-rated rookie, Luke Cowan-Dickie. England are preparing to be without Billy Twelvetrees for the Auckland match, after he went off with a damaged ankle last weekend. But the 25-year-old may still be selected in the hope that he can be fit for the later Tests in Dunedin and Hamilton. Midfield is another problem, with any two of Manu Tuilagi, Luther Burrell and Brad Barritt destined to be involved in the Premiership final. Other concerns are tighthead prop – where David Wilson is the only properly established figure – and fly half. With Owen Farrell, George Ford and Stephen Myler all potential finalists on May 31, Danny Cipriani could play against the Barbarians at Twickenham the following day, before joining the senior tour.

"Wayne Rooney's short tenure as Manchester United captain hit its lowest ebb on Sunday and he wasn't afraid to give his team-mates a rollicking as the Red Devils capitulated at Leicester. The 28-year-old publicly lambasted virtually all his colleagues as his side let a 3-1 lead slip against the Foxes to lose 5-3. Rooney's famous tempter was in full flow as United conceded their third goal scored by Esteban Cambiasso. Wayne Rooney (centre) lost his temper with his Manchester United team-mates during their defeat at Leicester on Sunday .

Daley Blind (left) was another team-mate to be on the receiving end of Rooney's outburst as the Old Trafford outfit lost 5-3 . Cambiasso's strike prompted the forward to explode in a fit of rage with Ander Herrera, Daley Blind and Tyler Blackett, the players closest, bearing the brunt. Rooney's mood would have only worsened as Jamie Vardy completed the remarkable turned around in the 79th minute before  Leonardo Ulloa completed the scoreline with a penalty as Blackett was sent off for a foul on Vardy inside the box. The England forward was appointed by United boss Louis van Gaal during pre-season and has currently led the Old Trafford outfit to five points from five games so far - with the only victory coming against QPR last week. The cause for Rooney's (left) outburst came after Cambiasso's (second right) equalising goal for Leicester in the second half . The 28-year-old was appointed Manchester United captain at the start of the season by new boss Louis van Gaal . After enjoying such a comprehensive win over the west London side, Van Gaal found the defeat at the King Power Stadium hard to take. 'We start last match against QPR very good with a new team, new players and then we played very well here, but we gave the game away,' the United manager said after the defeat at Leicester. 'Leicester had five shots on goal, and that was it. These five goals were existing because we made errors in ball possession. 'We created a lot of chances and made superb goals but you have to do that over 90 minutes, not 60 minutes. It was not enough today. 'You have to kill the game and we didn't do that.' Van Gaal (centre) blasted his side after the match stating that they 'gave the game away' against the newly promoted side .

"Topsy Ojo scored a first-half hat-trick of tries as London Irish got their European Rugby Challenge Cup campaign off to a barnstorming start with a 70-14 mauling of Rovigo at the Madejski Stadium. Irish came into their Pool One opener on the back of successive Aviva Premiership defeats to Northampton and Exeter but there was never any danger of another setback on Sunday as they ran in 10 tries against outclassed Rovigo., . Four of those came in the opening 40 minutes, with three of them being notched by former England wing Ojo, who opened the floodgates in the fifth minute before adding further scores in 30th and 37th minutes. London Irish winger Topsy Ojo was in top form crossing for three threes at the Madejski Stadium . Former Connacht centre Eoin Griffin (right) was making his debut for the Exiles . Jean-Francois Montauriol claims a lineout for Rovigo undre pressure from the London Irish pack .

Dorrian would end the match with a 25-point haul after successfully converting all 10 tries. Centre Eoin Griffin, making his Exiles debut, needed less than a minute of the second half to increase his side's lead before Rovigo finally got some points on the board when New Zealander Luke Mahoney scored a try that was converted by Stefan Basson. That was a rare moment of joy for the Italian visitors, though, as Irish resumed their assault on the Rovigo tryline and they crossed five more times through Leo Halavatau, Kieran Low, Tom Guest, Dan Leo and James Short - after returning from a yellow card - as they powered towards a resounding victory. Fly-half Myles Dorrian finished the match with a 25-point haul after successfully converting all 10 tries . New Zealander Luke Mahoney makes a strong charge into the Rovigo defence .

"Upheaval must suit Wasps. They were braced for mass protests at Adams Park on Sunday, after announcing a mid-season relocation to Coventry, but there was euphoria rather than anger as Bath were beaten. In the build-up to this Aviva Premiership match, there had been talk of demonstrations following the confirmation that Wasps will be based at the Ricoh Arena from December. Yet, any groundswell of angst was well disguised. There was one banner describing the nomadic club as a ‘franchise’, but even that had vanished by the second-half as Dai Young’s team stormed into a commanding lead. Ultimately, Wasps had to withstand a late Bath rear-guard action as the visitors recovered from 29-0 down to earn a losing bonus point, but there was a collective desperation among the home players to end a turbulent week on a high, which they duly did. Their feat was all the more remarkable as the controversy surrounding their imminent move was not the only disruption.

ATTENDANCE: 7,397. England lock Joe Launchbury was withdrawn from the team on Sunday morning after being involved in a car crash - just as his team-mate, Christian Wade, was last month. Young, the Wasps’ director of rugby, said: ‘There’s never a dull moment here. ‘Joe is fine. Him and his girlfriend were involved in car accident on the way to the game. They were a little bit shaken up. They went to hospital for a check-up and they’re both fine.’ So the last-minute loss of a key forward was a setback for Wasps, but they were glad to avoid the spectre of off-field unrest among their supporters. If anything, the announcement that they are off to the West Midlands seemed to have unexpectedly positive consequences - as they were vociferously backed by their biggest home attendance of the season. Captain James Haskell was evidently delighted by the reception accorded to he and his team-mates, saying: ‘I don’t know about protests - that’s the biggest crowd we’ve had this season. 'Perhaps we should say we’re moving somewhere else next week and we’ll get another big crowd.’ A Wasps fan holds a flag protesting against their move from Adams Park to Coventry's Ricoh Arena .

England star Joe Launchbury missed Wasps' victory over Bath after he and his pregnant partner were involved in a car crash. Launchbury tweeted: 'Great win Wasps Rugby today. Gutted to have missed out. Thanks for all your messages of concern. 'Had to go to hospital and check all was ok with my pregnant partner and baby after someone crashed into us. Luckily all is good!' Young added: ‘I totally understood the frustrations of the supporters early in the week, but once we explained everything properly, I saw a real change in their attitude to the move. It was a tough week for them but they got behind the team today and they should be commended and thanked for that.’ If Wasps’ early matches in Coventry are as entertaining as this, they may soon attract decent crowds to the Ricoh Arena. They routed Bath at the scrum as Matt Mullan turned the screw on England’s current first-choice tighthead prop, David Wilson, and from that platform they surged into a 15-0 lead courtesy of four Andy Goode penalties and one long-range shot from Elliot Daly. The visitors were all at sea in the set piece and they were in deeper disarray when three of their players were sent to the sin bin - Leroy Houston, Wilson and Micky Young. The latter man’s off-the-ball tackle on Wade as he chased through a kick by Daly led to a penalty try for Wasps in the 47th minute and left Bath down to 13 men. Moments later, Haskell released the outstanding Ashley Johnson from the back of a lineout on halfway and the flanker's superb off-load sent Sailosi Tagicakibau through a gap and he tore away to score by the posts. Goode converted again and any prospect of protests had been blown away as Wasps seized a 29-0 lead. Kyle Eastmond jumps over the line to score a try for Bath's but they ultimately lost the game at Adams Park . Tempers flare early on in the game as the forwards get into a fight during the match at Adams Park . But Bath have spirit to go with their attacking artistry and they rallied impressively. Kyle Eastmond’s pass picked out Jonathan Joseph on the left and the in-form centre fended off James Gaskell to touch down. Sixteen minutes from time, the deficit was down to 17 points as Young swerved over from close range and George Ford converted. The West Country side kept coming - sensing a way back from a seemingly hopeless position - and after another thunderous drive by Houston, David Sisi scored. Again, Ford added the extras and he followed that up with a 76th-minute penalty, but Wasps held firm to deny their rivals a draw. Young was relieved, saying: ‘That’s pretty much us all over - we either start really poorly and come back, or we end poorly, like we did today. We’re still searching for an 80-minute performance, but for 65 minutes we were outstanding.’ Bath’s head coach, Mike Ford, added: ‘We were just a bit off today - we didn’t have that edge. Our scrum wasn’t as good as it has been for the last two years. They wanted it more than us.’ Bath's Leroy Houston drops Wasps' Joe Simpson past the horizontal and is sin binned as a result .

He said: 'First and foremost, I'm delighted. I watched the game on Saturday and was very encouraged with what I saw. 'Gillingham is not an easy place to go and we controlled that game. 'To gain a job, someone has to lose a job and Russ did a fantastic job last season and has brought in some great players. 'It's exciting times for the football club. Injuries have caused us problems, so we have to get those players back. 'Every job is a different challenge. But saying that, it's the same challenge, we have to start picking points up.

"The top of Euro 2016 qualifying Group B is a 'great place to be', according to Gareth Bale. The Real Madrid forward put in another man-of-the-match performance as Wales beat Cyprus 2-1 on Monday night. They now have seven points from nine and head to Belgium next for a crunch tie. Wales remain unbeaten in Group B after two wins and one draw after the 2-1 win over Cyprus on Monday . Bale joins David Cotterill and Andy King in celebrating Wales' opening goal in the 2-1 win in Cardiff . 'It was a great start, we came out of the blocks and got the start,' Bale told Sky Sports 5 after David Cotterill and Hal Robson-Kanu scored early on. 'We made a little mistake off a set-piece (for the Cyprus goal) but you can see how much the lads want it. We're fighting for each other and the team spirit is amazing. The fans were unbelievable.' King looks surprised to be sent for an early bath after the challenge on Makrides during the Euro 2016 qualifier . Bale is fouled by Marios Nikolaou, as the Cyprus players gave the Real Madrid star a rough ride in Cardiff . Wales had to hang on after Andy King was sent off but Bale added: 'We worked hard and covered every blade of grass and showed how much we wanted it. 'It's a great place to be.

"Bae Sang-moon won his second PGA Tour event as he claimed a two-shot victory at the Frys.com Open in California. The victory in the season opener breaks a long spell of indifferent form for the South Korean who failed to register a single top-10 finish in between his maiden triumph at the AT&T Byron Nelson Championship last May and Sunday afternoon. Bae fired more than 70 for the first time in the week in his final round with a one-over-par 73 but was able to keep Australia's Steven Bowditch at bay after coming into the final round with a four-shot lead. Bae Sang-moon claimed his second PGA Tour event title with a two-shot victory at the Frys.com Open . The South Korean claimed victory by two shots in California following an indifferent 18 months of form . And the 28-year-old admits he was suffering from some final round jitters before eventually sealing victory on a score of 15 under. 'I was very frustrated,' Bae told pgatour.com. 'Even though my game was good, the score wasn't. I was very frustrated and I was very anxious and nervous.' Bae looked to be cruising as he reached the turn in 35 after two birdies and a bogey but a run of three bogeys in four holes from 11 to 14 - he birdied 12 - saw him come under a little pressure. Bowditch closed with a 67 to be the nearest challenger to Bae, who becomes just the third South Korean to register more than win on the Tour after K.J. Choi and Y.E. Yang. Bowditch bogeyed the eighth and picked the shot back up on nine as he looked unlikely to make any sort of tilt at the title on the front half. Australian Steven Bowditch finished second at the Frys.com Open with a total score of 13 under par . But birdies on 12 and 14, an eagle on 16 and a closing birdie on the last saw him move into second place, one shot clear of Bryce Molder, Hideki Matsuyama, Retief Goosen, Hunter Mahan and Martin Laird. A closing 71 meant Scotsman Laird, who was leading the tournament at halfway, finished the week without an over-par round but he was still disappointed not to be able to turn his returning good form into a win. 'Some weeks you feel really good about finishing third and some weeks you kind of are frustrated, thinking that you could have done better,' he said. 'And it was one of those weeks for me. I'm going to take a couple days to get over this one.' Bae Sang-moon could only manage a one-over-par final round of 73 but managed to hold on for victory . Jarrod Lyle enjoyed a successful return to the Tour following his battle with leukemia as he fired a closing 70 to finish the week on five under. The Australian had not started a tour event since February 2012 as he fought the illness for the second time and had to come through qualifying to secure his place in the field. 'To come here without a tournament to play, and then get through on the Monday (qualifier) and make the cut and play reasonable golf for four days, I couldn't ask for anything better,' he said. 'It's something to build on for the rest of the year.' Lee Westwood got his PGA Tour season off to a satisfactory start after a disappointing 2013/14, finishing with a 67 to finish on 10 under while American Brooks Koepka, who splits his time with the European Tour, was one shot better off.

"Alexander Levy has won the Portugal Masters after the event was reduced to 36 holes as more rain battered the Oceanico Victoria Golf Club. The tournament had already been reduced to 54 holes after heavy rain on Thursday evening and Friday meant many players could not start their second rounds until the weekend. And Levy and playing partner Nicolas Colsaerts had played just a single hole of their third and final round on Sunday when the heavens opened once more, drenching the course, with organisers deciding at approximately 3.15pm that the result would be decided on 36-hole scores. Alexander Levy poses with the winners trophy after finishing on top of the leaderboard . French golfer Levy follows his drive from the first tee as he started the final round of the Portugal Masters . Levy had to deal with tricky weather conditions to win the tournament held in Vilamoura, southern Portugal . That meant the Frenchman, who had recorded rounds of 63 and 61 claimed his second European Tour win following his victory at the Volvo China Open in April. 'It feels very special,' he told Sky Sports 4. 'If at the start of the year you say to me, ""You are going to win two tournaments"", I (would) say 'never' to you. 'It's a very nice feeling to me, I'm very happy. 'I work hard on this game and I think I played a good game this week and the week in China.' Levy was one of the lucky ones who managed to get his second round completed on Friday meaning he did not play at all on Saturday and he admitted it was a strange feeling to have won after playing only two rounds. 'It's special,' he added. 'Because you are only on 36 holes but after Friday night I knew I would only play 54. But it's a special feeling at this time. 'I don't realise a lot because I was focused to play this last round and try my best to win this tournament.'

Levy will now head to Kent to play in the World Matchplay next week before he approaches the Final Series as the Race to Dubai reaches its conclusion and he is hopeful of maintaining his good form. 'I'm going to try to play like I played the first two rounds,' he said. 'I've impressed myself with the way I've played golf and I think I need to continue like that.' Colsaerts parred the first alongside Levy and finished three shots behind him on 15 under with Chile's Felipe Aguilar, Dane Morten Orum Madsen and France's Romain Wattel three further shots back. Only four players managed to complete their final rounds, including victorious Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley, but none of the field were looking like mounting a serious charge on the leaders when play was stopped. Danish golfer Morten Madsen walks on the flooded second green during the final round of the Portugal Masters . Tournament Director Jose Maria Zamora explained that an errant weather forecast had not helped organisers in their contingency plans but stressed that he felt the right decision had been made. 'It's very tough, we were confident that we would be able to play this third round,' he said. 'The forecast wasn't that bad so we thought it would be really nice to give a clean third round to the sponsors here in Portugal and have a nice end of the tournament. 'Unfortunately we've been hit by a very heavy downpour, followed by another heavy downpour an hour later which made the golf course go completely underwater.' He added: 'There are important facts here which is mainly the sponsors and obviously we have to take into consideration that we have got tournaments far away in Hong Kong - if we delay the guys will not be able to play practice rounds. We have two tournaments next week. 'But the main thing is the tournament here - to try to deliver a result. 'With the forecast we had, we were not expecting these heavy downpours and we had to cut it to 36 holes.'","The Frenchman had to overcome tricky weather conditions to win trophy .

"A double-wicket maiden in the final over from Glenn Maxwell saw Australia complete a one-run victory and a 3-0 series whitewash over Pakistan in a remarkable one-day international in Abu Dhabi. The visitors looked like they had blown it when, with Pakistan eight wickets down and needing 24 for victory, they failed to appeal a run-out by James Faulkner, who dislodged the bails at the second attempt after failing with his first to dismiss Zulfiqar Babar. Australia, who made 231 for nine in their 50 overs, failed to appeal, feeling they had missed their chance. Australia celebrates after winning the third match of the one day series between Australia and Pakistan . Replays showed that Zulfiqar was in fact inches short and it looked like Pakistan would take advantage as they slowly chalked off the runs needed for the win. With just two runs needed from the final over, though, Maxwell - whose 76 with the bat had helped his side with the second ODI - this time bowled Sohail Tanvir and sent down three dot balls at number 11 Mohammed Irfan before having the pace bowler caught off the final ball to complete a remarkable triumph. Earlier in the day, Australia had made an unusually conservative start and Anwar Ali made the breakthrough in his second over as Aaron Finch chipped to mid-on for a 34-ball 18. A maximum off Zulfiqar aside, David Warner continued to play conservatively until he went in the 22nd over, when Shahid Afridi's slower delivery caused the opener to mistime his shot and hit straight back at the bowler for 56. Ahmed Shahzad of Pakistan is stumped by Brad Haddin of Australia . Skipper George Bailey lasted just three balls after he sliced to Ahmed Shehzad off Irfan to leave the visitors 103 for three in the 23rd over. Steve Smith and Maxwell went about rebuilding the innings, but Pakistan again struck at just the right time as Maxwell slog-swept to Umar Amin off Afridi for 20. Phil Hughes fell lbw to Tanvir for five before Brad Haddin was run out for two thanks to a direct hit by Ali. At 159 for six Australia were firmly on the back foot, although Smith, who had just passed 50, was still at the crease. Faulkner is used to attacking from the off when coming to the crease but with his side in a precarious position, the all rounder did not find the boundary until his 24th delivery. Four balls later Smith was gone for 77 after he was bowled by Tanvir, before Faulkner smashed a trademark six back over the bowler's head. Mitchell Starc was run out for five before Tanvir picked up his third wicket, bowling Faulkner for 33 with the first ball of the final over. Pakistan - with the experienced Misbah-ul-Haq sitting out - were equally conservative with just five boundaries in the first 10 overs, though Shehzad hit two consecutively off Faulkner in the eighth. And just an over later the home side lost their first wicket when Shehzad was bowled by Xavier Doherty, cutting when the delivery was too full. Sarfraz Ahmed was then run out for 32 to leave Pakistan 80 for two in the 18th over. Two wickets became three when Smith showed tremendous anticipation to move from first slip to leg slip when he saw Fawad Alam move into position to sweep, to take the catch off Doherty. Asad Shafiq and Sohaib Maqsood put on a much-needed 74-run partnership before the latter fell for 34, caught by Warner off the bowling of Kane Richardson. With Pakistan's history of dramatic batting collapses to spur them on, Australia picked up a fifth wicket with 72 runs still needed when Shafiq was trapped in front by Faulkner. With stability a necessity, Afridi once again failed to provide it, inexplicably mis-timing a pull shot to mid-on Smith off Richardson. Umar Amin was bowled by Starc for 19 and Anwar Ali (14) was caught by Maxwell off Faulkner before the game played out to an incredible conclusion.","Glenn Maxwell takes double-wicket maiden in the final over to secure victory .

"Spain striker Paco Alcacer is confident Diego Costa will break his goalscoring duck for the national side sooner rather than later as La Roja prepare to face Luxembourg in a Euro 2016 qualification match on Sunday. Costa, who joined Chelsea from Atletico Madrid in July, has regularly hit the target for the Blues but is still to find the back of the net for Spain. Valencia frontman Alcacer, 21, believes Costa will open his Spain account soon and that he should follow the example set by captain Iker Casillas. Striker Diego Costa  failed to score for Spain as they slumped to a 2-1 defeat against Slovakia on Thursday . Chelsea star Costa has now gone six games for Spain without scoring since making his debut in March . Valencia striker Paco Alcacer has backed fellow frontman Costa to break his Spain duck soon . Costa congratulated  Alcacer after the forward scored past Slovakia goalkeeper Matus Kozacik on Thursday . 'He will score soon. I have a very high opinion of him,' Alcacer told Marca. 'These good and bad patches are quite normal and soon his first goal will come. 'He (Casillas) is an example to follow. You can't judge him just by a single game.' Spain lost their second Group C match against Slovakia 2-1 on Thursday in a game where they created several chances but lacked the clinical edge to put them away. Alcacer added: 'On the one hand I'm very happy. Every time I go out on the field I try to do my bit, but on the other I wasn't happy as we lost the three points. 'After the game we weren't happy. We created some good chances but didn't convert them. Now we have to look to Sunday and the Luxembourg game, which is the first one to put all this behind us. Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas missed the ball to allow Slovakia to score but Alacer has backed the stopper . 'The important game is not the last one, but the next one. This result is a blow, but the game against Luxembourg will serve to catapult us back up.' Spain defender Cesar Azpilicueta called for Vicente Del Bosque's side to pull together after the defeat. 'None of us like losing. It's clear that we're all in the same boat. We have to take a long, hard look at ourselves, improve and be self-critical,' the 25-year-old, who was an unused substitute against Slovakia, said. 'The criticism from the outside is understandable. We're going through a rough patch right now, but we're convinced we'll bounce back. Spain will look to bounce back against Luxembourg on Sunday after their first qualification defeat since 2006 . 'Teams are making it harder for us and we have to deal with that. Spain hadn't lost a qualifier since 2006. We were young then and we never wanted this moment to come.' Luxembourg approach the match on the back of a dramatic 3-2 late defeat by Macedonia but coach Luc Holtz is focusing on the positives ahead of the clash with Spain. 'Late in the game, it could have gone in one direction or the other, it was a solo effort that made the difference,' he told L'essential. 'But for us to score two goals, it is very positive. 'We must not dwell on this defeat and by Friday we'll focus on Sunday's game against Spain.'","Diego Costa has six Spain caps but is yet to score for his adopted nation .

"Wales captain Ashley Williams was frustrated after wasting one of his side's best chances as they drew 0-0 with Bosnia and Herzegovina in European Championship qualifying.

Hennessey made a stunning point-blank save from Haris Medunjanin and also denied Edin Dzeko on several occasions, but he too paid tribute to the defence in front of him.

"Nicolas Colsaerts narrowly failed to record the European Tour's first round of 59 as he made a blistering start at the Portugal Masters. The Belgian almost earned a place in history as a long-range putt on the 18th green at Oceanico Victoria Golf Club in Vilamoura shaved the edge of the hole. That meant Colsaerts, who hit a European Tour record 447-yard drive last month, had to settle for a first-round 60 but it was still nevertheless a superb opening that put him in charge on 11 under. Nicolas Colsaerts almost earned a place in history as a long-range putt on the 18th green . Colsaerts completed his round shortly before the day's play was abandoned when a torrential downpour flooded parts of the course. His closest challengers were Scotland's Scott Jamieson and Frenchman Alexander Levy, who both signed for eight-under-par 63s. Spain's Adrian Otaegui was seven under after 14 holes when play was washed out, meaning he could yet get close to Colsaerts' mark when play resumes on Friday. Fellow Spaniard Rafa Cabrera-Bello was in the clubhouse on seven under after a 64. Jamieson posted his mark early with a nine-birdie round but the day belonged to Colsaerts, who hit the ground running as he set off in pursuit of the Scot. He birdied the first, fourth and fifth and then sank four more birdies in succession around the turn. The fabled 59, never achieved in 42 years of the European Tour, then became a possibility as he drove the green at the par-four 15th and holed for eagle. A second eagle at the 17th left him needing to pick up one more stroke at the last, but his 18-foot birdie putt there stopped, agonisingly, millimetres left of the hole. He tapped in for par and gestured to a camera with thumb and forefinger as he walked away, indicating how close he had come. 'Still cant believe that putt on 18 didnt drop for magical 59 £personalbest,' Colsaerts later tweeted. He told the European Tour's website: 'When I made eagle on 15, I knew then that if I birdied the last three, that would have been 59.' Chris Wood escapes a water hazard during the first day of the Portugal Masters . Discussing the crucial putt, Colsaerts added: 'I thought it was going to be slightly left to right at the end and it kind of went straight and basically just left it hanging. Too bad, I thought it was a pretty good effort, especially with these dark clouds that we saw at the back. It's a great setting.' Jamieson caught the eye in the morning, with the one blemish on his round coming at the 17th, his eighth, where he found water and took a bogey six. Jamieson said on Sky Sports: 'It was fantastic. I got off to a great start, five under through seven holes on the back nine. I fancied my chances of getting on 17 in two but went in the water. 'But I tried to stay patient. I knew I was playing well and I was able to finish off with two birdies.' England's Ross Fisher lines up his putt on the seventh green  at the Oceanico Victoria course in Vilamoura . There were no bogeys on Levy's card, the Frenchman setting up his excellent round with five birdies on the front nine. Defending champion David Lynn was among four players to shoot 65, along with fellow Englishman Danny Willett, Chile's Felipe Aguilar and Scotland's Chris Doak, who maintained his form after taking fifth at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship. Oliver Wilson, the fairytale winner in Scotland last week, had a less successful day, shooting a one-over-par 72. Paul McGinley, Europe's victorious Ryder Cup captain, continued to play on adrenaline and ended the first round in a tie for 18th after a tidy four-under-par 67 .

"Ashley Giles has been confirmed as Lancashire's new cricket director and head coach. Former England limited-overs coach, and Ashes-winning spinner, Giles fills the vacancy created after Lancashire stalwart Mike Watkinson stepped down from his position as cricket director. A statement on Lancashire's website said: 'Lancashire County Cricket Club is delighted to announce the appointment of Ashley Giles as its Cricket Director and Head Coach.' Ashley Giles was England's limited-overs coach between 2012 and the start of this year . Giles added: 'Lancashire is a massive club with a rich pedigree and history, and I am thrilled by the prospect of coaching them. 'Emirates Old Trafford is a stunning international venue with excellent facilities, and I cannot wait to work with the players and staff. 'It is our intention to return to Division One - but our main aim is create something both successful and sustainable, which a club with such an incredible history deserves.' Giles' twin role suggests veteran club captain Glen Chapple will not be combining the responsibility of leading the team on the field next season and coaching off it. The task facing Giles will be to revive Lancashire's fortunes, after they were relegated from LV= County Championship Division One on the final day of the season in last month's shoot-out with Middlesex at Old Trafford. Giles, 41, was England's limited-overs coach between 2012 and the start of this year. He missed out to former Lancashire coach Peter Moores when the England and Wales Cricket Board combined the posts in charge of the Test and limited-overs teams six months ago. He has now joined Lancashire CC as coach, the club that fellow Ashes-winning team-mate Freddie Flintoff (right) made a return to cricket with earlier this year . Giles had a successful period coaching Warwickshire, after retiring as a player. He was most recently linked with the coaching vacancy at Somerset - and when Matthew Maynard landed that job, Giles immediately became a front-runner should the opportunity arise at Old Trafford. Lancashire chairman Michael Cairns said: 'Ashley Giles is a highly respected and regarded coach with a track record of success in the county game, and has a tremendous amount of international experience garnered through a playing and coaching career. 'He is an exceptional candidate for a county like Lancashire, and we are delighted to have secured his services.'","Ashley Giles was England limited-overs coach from 2012 until early this year .

"Dual Derby winner Australia has been retired to stud, according to a Coolmore representative. In a shock announcement, time has been called on the racing career of the high-class Galileo colt, who had been set to make his swansong on Qipco British Champions Day at Ascot next Saturday. Kevin Buckley, UK representative for Coolmore, told Channel 4 Racing: 'Unfortunately Australia developed a problem in his right-hind hoof during the week. English and Irish Derby winner Australia (centre) 'retired to stud' according to a Coolmore representative . Jockey Joseph O'Brien celebrates with Australia after winning The Investec Derby at Epsom in June 2014 . 'Following consultation between the resident farrier at Ballydoyle, our vet, John Halley, and the respective owners, the decision was made to retire him to Coolmore.' Described by trainer Aidan O'Brien as the best horse he has ever trained, Australia earned more than £2million in prize money during a superb career which yielded five victories from eight starts. The three-year-old announced himself as a major player in a Group Three at Leopardstown in September 2013, when he accounted for Free Eagle by six lengths. A narrow third upon his return to action in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket, he went on to claim victories in the Epsom and Irish Derby, after which he won the Juddmonte International at York. His tall reputation was, however, slightly tarnished in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown last month when York runner-up The Grey Gatsby gained his revenge in a dramatic race. Australia (right) and Joseph O'Brien race clear of the field to win the Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby in June 2014 . Australia would nonetheless have been one of the star attractions on Champions Day next weekend, but Buckley was adamant the Ballydoyle team could not afford to take any risks at this stage of his career. He said: 'We were all looking forward to it (going to Ascot), but, as you can appreciate, any type of setback like that jeopardises the training regime. 'Hence we had to take that decision he wouldn't be ready for the Champion Stakes.' David O'Loughlin, Coolmore director of sales, added: 'Australia nearly won the best Guineas in the modern era. 'He's probably quicker than Galileo.' O'Brien and Australia are led into the winners enclosure at Epsom after winning the Investec Derby in June . Ballydoyle farrier Jeff Henderson accepted the challenge of getting Australia ready for Ascot was over once an infection in the problematic hoof had worsened. He said: 'At the beginning of the week we discovered a bit of soreness in the heel, which made us suspicious of a hoof abscess. 'We poulticed away at it and the infection came out and there were no soundness issues at all. 'Then a couple of days later, he pulled out lame and, on inspection, we realised the infection had blown out through the bottom of the foot as well as the top. 'In a case like that, it was going to take a couple of weeks for the stability to come back.'","Coolmore representative says Australia will be retired to stud due to injury .

The 45-year-old replaced Oscar Garcia as head coach at the end of September and opened his account with a 2-1 victory over Brentford before drawing with Brighton last weekend.

"British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton has vowed his track squad will be ready for the Rio in two years despite playing second fiddle to Australia at the Commonwealth Games. Since Team GB ruled the velodrome at London 2012 they have slipped back, disappointing at the World Championships in Cali while Australia were well ahead of the home nations in Glasgow - topping the medal table with seven golds and 20 in total. Sutton's England team managed nine overall, with golds for Joanna Rowsell and Laura Trott, as well as two wins for Sophie Thornhill and Helen Scott in the para-sport tandem rides. Top dog: Shane Sutton grabs a hold of Sir Bradley Wiggins in the Velodrome in Glasgow . It's gold! Again! Laura Trott poses with her gold medal at Glasgow 2014 to add to her Olympic double . Close: Elinor Barker (silver) and Katie Archibald (bronze) couldn't quite beat Trott as home nations dominated . The British tally was boosted by five medals for Scotland, three for Wales and one silver for the Isle of Man's Pete Kennaugh, but there was no escaping the formidable statement laid down by Australia and 11-medal New Zealand. Sutton, though, has vowed to get his riders to peak performance for 2016. 'Ultimately there were some dominant performances from the Aussies and the Kiwis which you would expect knowing the importance of this event to them, which I do being an Aussie myself,' said Sutton, now heading up British Cycling since Sir Dave Brailsford stepped down. 'But we know how to get it right. We've been there and done that. 'We came here to represent England and to win and I think, given where we were at this year's World Championships, we've done Team England proud. 'There are a lot of positives going forward, as well as some riders who didn't perform as well as they'd have liked. 'But there's no doubt we will be ready. Whether we'll win in Rio, I don't know, but we will be ready. 'We have the 'Rio Ready Mission' by January 1. From January we'll really nail our focus on everything about Rio and from this competition we've learned a lot. 'I don't feel like there is a lot we can criticise here.' Not well: Kenny said he was 'shattered' and felt 'terrible' after losing in the men's sprint final . Unlucky: England's Kenny could not beat New Zealand's Webster but settled for Games silver . The overall picture was lifted by Trott's thrilling points race gold on the final day at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome - heading up a British one, two, three in front of Wales' Elinor Barker and Scotland's Katie Archibald. Sutton denied the double Olympic champion, who had been struggling with a kidney infection, had spared the squad's blushes with her late success but was effusive in his praise for the 22-year-old. 'I wouldn't say it saved face, it just showed when it matters the great ones step up,' he said. 'Expectation is one of the things that kills Laura at times. She finds it tough, she thinks the crowd expects. She was putting too much pressure on herself. 'I just said to her ""it's all about Rio for you, have some fun"". Gold: England's Joanna Rowsell came out on top in the 3,000m individual pursuit cycling final . Unbelievable: The 25-year-old won an Olympic gold in the women's team pursuit and did so in Glasgow .

"Andy Schleck, the 2010 Tour de France champion, has announced his retirement from cycling at the age of 29. The son of former rider Johnny Schleck and younger brother of Frank cited a knee injury as the deciding factor in his decision, which he announced at a media conference in his home town of Mondorf-les-Bains, Luxembourg. 'I'm obviously disappointed to end my career like this,' Schleck said in a Trek Factory Racing team statement. 2010 Tour de France champion Andy Schleck has announced his retirement from cycling . 'Cycling has been my life for many years and I will need time to figure out what I'd like to do (next). I'm excited to find out what lies ahead.' Schleck won his yellow jersey after Alberto Contador was stripped of the title for an anti-doping infringement. The pair eye-balling each other on the Col du Tourmalet through the mist in the decisive stage of the 2010 race was memorable. So too was Schleck's third - and final - Tour stage success, when he won on the Col du Galibier after a long solo attack as he went on to finish second to Cadel Evans in the 2011 race. It was his second runner-up place in the Tour, after a 2009 second, and third in Grand Tours after his second place in the 2007 Giro d'Italia. Schleck on the podium with the overall leader's yellow jersey after winning the Tour de France 2010 . Niggling injuries saw Schleck struggle to reach the same heights in the last three years and he abandoned the 2014 Tour before it resumed in France following its UK start. The knee injury sustained in a crash on the third stage from Cambridge to London was a factor in the end. 'I would have liked to keep on fighting but my knee just doesn't allow it,' Schleck added. 'Since my crash in the UK there has hardly been any progress. While the ligaments have healed, the damaged cartilage is another story. 'I have been working hard on rehabbing the knee but came to the hard realisation that at the risk of irreversibly injuring it, this is the best course of action.' Frank Schleck will continue to ride for Trek Factory Racing in 2015 after signing a two-year contract extension.","Andy Schleck announces retirement from cycling .

"There's a print of a monkey’s head on Neil Fachie’s cycling helmet but, after gorging himself on gold, the Aberdonian would be perfectly entitled to consider a portrait of something faster. Fachie and pilot Craig MacLean combine the darting speed of a gazelle with the brute strength of a big cat and, against even their own expectations, pooled their resources to dig out their second gold of these games in the Sprint B Tandem. Known as the ‘Power Monkey’ for his perky persona and physical fortitude, there’s no aping around when Fachie climbs on his bike. The partially-sighted cyclist is already a World and Paralympic champion and now he and McLean can call themselves double Commonwealth champions and Scotland’s first multiple gold winners of 2014. Pride: Neil Fachie and pilot Craig MacLean celebrate after winning the tandem final on Saturday . This latest success was hardearned and somewhat unexpected. Fachie, . 30, tweeted before the final that the odds were against the Scots and . he looked worryingly correct after the first leg of the final against . Australians Kieran Modra and Jason Niblett. ‘The . morning session was such a struggle for us, we were just so fatigued . from yesterday,’ said Fachie as he soaked up the acclaim of the crowd in . the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome. ‘Qualifying . didn’t go that well and I felt absolutely awful after it. We got . through the semi-final and it was a real effort. The Aussies were . flying, they killed us in qualifying, and I knew they had a lot they . could use against us. ‘They are such a talented team and I knew it was going to be a struggle. The first ride proved that and I have no idea where we found what we did at the end. ‘It just comes down to the crowd. Without them I doubt we’d have done it.’ After . Friday’s heroics in the 1,000 metres time trial, Fachie was not alone . in fearing there would be a toll on the duo’s legs, and the suspicion . lingered when they qualified for the final slower than Modra and . Niblett. Beaten a little too . comfortably in that first race of the final, gold looked a forlorn hope . until a heroically strong finish in the second . left them with a shot in the decider. Who knows what alchemy occurs . when the roar of an expectant home crowd transfuses energy into an . athlete’s legs but by the end of the decider they had streaked ahead to a . rapturous reception. Shots fired: Fachie points out to the vociferous Glasgow crowd following the win . Sir . Chris was in the commentary gantry to see his former team-mate MacLean . claim another medal but it was to his family that the 42-year-old made a . beeline at the end. ‘At the . Melbourne Games I was in deep trouble for not going up to the stands . and saying hello to my family,’ he revealed. ‘I have kids . here now, and it’s very special having them in the crowd. It was extra . special to do it front of a predominantly Scottish audience. It’s not . often you get to do that and it means a lot as potentially it’s the last . time I will do this in my career. ‘I am not retiring just yet but I am not going to see another Commonwealth Games, certainly not in Scotland.’ The . night before Billy Connolly provided the celebrity support and this . time there was royalty in attendance in the form of Prince Edward. Still, Fachie hopes his achievements reach a wider audience than the . 4,000 or so in attendance. Comeback: The Scottish pair had to come from 1-0 down in the best-of-three final to win . ‘You . don’t really consider yourself inspirational but it is nice when people . come up to you,’ he added. ‘There are so many people with visual . impairments in Scotland and the UK and the sad thing is we only have two . British bikes here and there is not even an English tandem. ‘There are so many people who could be taking up the opportunity and if anyone is inspired by me to do that then I am happy.’ Earlier, there was disappointment for Katie Archibald who was tipped for a medal in the 10km scratch race, but finished fifth as . Australia’s Annette Edmondson took gold. Archibald . will go again in the 25km points race, her favoured event. ‘I guess I . was in a prime position at the end and it just didn’t happen,’ reflected . the 20-year-old Sportsmail columnist. ‘The . scratch race is such a short event that you’ve really only got one . chance at it, whereas the points race I feel it’s always the strongest rider who comes out on top.’","Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome salutes Scottish winners for second day running .

"Geraint Thomas won Commonwealth Games gold for Wales in the men's road race on the final day of Glasgow 2014. Thomas, the time-trial bronze medallist on Thursday, triumphed in torrential rain on the 12-lap, 168-kilometres undulating course in a race which became about survival and brute strength. The 28-year-old from Cardiff, who finished the Tour de France last Sunday, twice suffered front-wheel punctures, including in the last six kilometres as his rivals neared. Top dog: Wales' Geraint Thomas won gold in the men's Commonwealth Games road race on Sunday . Thumbs up: Thomas recovered from two front-wheel punctures to win his first Commonwealth gold . But Thomas soloed to victory by one minute 21 seconds as Jack Bauer of New Zealand beat Scott Thwaites of England to silver, the Yorkshireman having to settle for bronze. The Isle of Man's Pete Kennaugh, who won the island's only medal of the 2014 Games with points race silver on the track, led on his own for 116 kilometres, ultimately in vain. Lizzie Armitstead earlier led an England one-two ahead of retiring team-mate Emma Pooley in a thrilling women's road race. Tough conditions: The men's road race was made harder by the non-stop rain during the event . With Cavendish, recovering from shoulder surgery, in the team car, Kennaugh was the Isle of Man's undisputed leader and attacked after 3km. The 25-year-old, who was racing on the second anniversary of his London 2012 team pursuit triumph, was left out of Team Sky's Tour de France squad, responding by winning the British Championships, the Tour of Austria and his Commonwealth silver in the points race at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome. Kennaugh insisted he had no need to prove a point, that his pedigree was free for all to see, and clearly felt strong. He was seen in discussions with Cavendish, who was leaning out of the team car, on the third lap, with the rider's tactics perhaps being questioned as he ploughed on alone through teeming rain and swirling winds. At one point he had to avoid an umbrella blowing across the route and his lead was cut once Australia persuaded other teams to share in the chase. Proud moment: Thomas stands on the podium alongside Jack Bauer (left) and Scott Thwaites (right) The Manxman was caught by a counter-attack featuring Bauer, Thwaites and Thomas, who had earlier required a wheel change due to a puncture, with 49km to go and, perhaps inevitably, slipped back as soon as he was caught. The trio led at the bell and it was just a matter of 14km to decide their final podium placings. Knowing Thwaites has a good kick, Thomas went early, accelerating on the final ascent of St Vincent Street. There was still drama for Thomas, who required a further front wheel change which was excruciatingly long in the closing moments. Fortunately for the Welshman he had built enough of a lead to absorb the losses and go on to win. Just 14 of the 139 riders took to the last of the 12 laps in horrendous conditions as anyone more than 10 minutes behind the leader on each lap was eliminated.","Geraint Thomas wins Commonwealth gold in men's road race .

Eighteen-year-old para-cyclist Thornhill and her pilot Scott followed up their day-one victory in the B2 sprint with another rousing performance at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome. Just as they did on Thursday, Thornhill and Scott nudged Scottish favourites Aileen McGlynn and Louise Haston into silver with a time of one minute 0.87 seconds.

They continued making gains and had a commanding lead of 1.455secs by the halfway stage, making the second 500m a case of mere preservation. They ended up 1.584 in front of the Scottish duo but were given an appreciative roar by the Glaswegian crowd. Thornhill was ready to celebrate in style having enjoyed her experience at her first able-bodied Games: 'To come away with the gold and that time I can't believe it. There is a bottle of champagne waiting for us up in our room so we will pop that open and have a few glasses and just enjoy it. 'It is crazy...our World Championship didn't get anywhere near as much coverage as this. 'For everyone to give us the same recognition as the able-body guys is amazing. Ecstatic: Thornhill and Scott lie back and bask in the glory of gold after the victory at the velodrome . 'This environment is so exciting and I can't wait for Rio now.' There was more good news soon after for England as Jess Varnish claimed bronze in the women's individual sprint. Riding against Malaysia's Fatehah Mustapa in a best-of-three head to head, Varnish was awarded the first race when commissaires relegated Mustapa for unfairly holding her line on the final straight. The second race was a more decisive affair, Varnish leading her opponent out and leaving her for dead to triumph in style. Australian great Anna Meares, going for a record sixth Commonwealth Gold and second of this Games, was surprisingly beaten 2-0 in the gold medal match by compatriot Stephanie Morton.

"Sir Dave Brailsford has admitted he omitted Sir Bradley Wiggins from Team Sky's Tour de France line up because of his fractured relationship with Chris Froome. Brailsford faced some criticism for excluding Wiggins, particularly after Froome crashed out only a few days into the race. Speaking at the Leaders in Sport conference at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, Brailsford says he had to put the feelings of team leader Froome first, and felt the inclusion of Wiggins in the nine man team when they clearly loathe one another would be counter-productive. Sir Bradley Wiggins was snubbed from this year's Tour de France line up . 'You can have a nice popular team if you want but popularity doesn't always win,' said Brailsford in clear reference to the disappointment felt that Wiggins would not be riding the three English stages of this year's Tour. 'Forget Kevin Pietersen,' he said. 'I had a few of my own to deal with, and there are challenges. 'We had a tricky season with two big champions, big personalities - very driven. 'A number of times people said to me 'why don't you get Chris and Brad in a room, bang their heads together and tell them to get on with it'. Chris Froome was preferred to Wiggins, but his bid for glory was ended by injury . 'That would have been the easiest thing to do. But over three weeks in France you are travelling together in the morning, racing, then travelling after and eating together. It would have been like a Big Brother scenario. 'I had to ask myself if that was going to be optimal for the team in that environment. And the answer was no. 'Our best chance of winning the Tour lay in Chris's hands and I had to build the team around Chris. 'You get challenging scenarios; difficult decisions that can be fairly uncomfortable. But my analysis was, do we want to win?' Sir Dave Brailsford has defended his decision to leave out Wiggins from the Team Sky squad . After a difficult year for Sky – that followed back-to-back wins at the Tour – Brailsford said he was considering ripping up the blueprint that has delivered so much success and starting again. 'I'm not trying to work out what a sports team in 2020 is going to look like,' he said. He also said Wiggins would be targeting the iconic hour record in June. 'There is a plan for him to do it and I'm sure he can do it,' said Brailsford. 'When you look at the riders who could go for the hour record, and feasibly achieve a better distance than Jens Voigt's just achieved, then I think Bradley's probably one of the most accomplished.'","Sir Bradley Wiggins omitted from Team Sky's nine man team .

"The team that supported Vincenzo Nibali to victory in this year’s Tour de France were faced with suspending themselves from racing on Friday after one of their riders failed a test for the banned blood-boosting drug, erythropoietin. Maxim Iglinskiy was a member of the nine-man Astana squad that helped Nibali secure victory in July and the Kazakh-funded team have already provisionally suspended their rider after the UCI reported that he had failed a dope test on August 1. Now, however, regulations could demand that the team has to suspend itself as well, causing huge embarrassment to Nibali in what would amount to another crushing blow to the sport in its battle against doping. Maxim Iglinskiy (L) has been provisionally suspended after a positive drugs test . Italian Vincenzo Nibali celebrates winning the 2014 Tour de France on the podium at the Champs-Elysees . Astana team manager Alexandre Vinokourov, the Olympic road race champion in London in 2012 and himself a convicted doper, said in a statement: ‘In accordance with regulations of the MPCC (Movement for Credible Cycling) to which the Astana team first adhered in 2013, the rider is suspended provisionally and shall remain out of competition in anticipation of the results from the B analysis. All Astana Pro Team riders are contractually obliged to respect strict ethical rules and regulations.’ The MPCC regulations also demand that a team must suspend itself from racing for eight days in the case of multiple positives over a 12 month period. Only last month Iglinskiy’s brother and fellow Astana rider Valentin was also suspended for failing an EPO test in August. Astana – which was also the team Alberto Contador rode for when he won the 2010 Tour, only to then be stripped of the title because of a doping offence - are now set to miss next week’s Tour of Beijing.

"Thailand are in talks with Tour de France organisers about bringing the world's most prestigious cycling race to Asia for the first time and are confident of doing so by 2016, a senior tourism official said on Thursday. The Tourism Authority of Thailand said they had held fruitful talks with Jean-Etienne Amaury, Chairman of the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) who organise the Tour de France, last month in Paris and were encouraged. 'We are still talking with Tour de France organisers but we are looking at next fiscal year. So 2016, not 2015,' TAT governor Thawatchai Arunyik told Reuters. The Tour de France traditionally ends on the Champs Elysee in Paris, but could it be set to move abroad? Britain's two winners, Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome, lead the climb during the 2012 race . 'We're not sure yet how many stages we will hold whether it is one or two stages or the whole competition. This is something that still needs to be discussed. 'Thailand is the perfect location for this highly prestigious competition, not to mention that cycling as a sport is enjoying enormous popularity here at the moment.' The ASO was unable to provide immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. The Tour has stages abroad, including this year's Grand Depart in Yorkshire, which was a huge success . Yorkshire has begun its own tour since this year's race, but could Thailand take the whole Tour de France? This year's winner Vincenzo Nibali celebrates after winning the iconic race in Paris . The Tour, first held in 1903, is one of the most gruelling sporting tests, with professional cyclists completing last year's 3,663.5 kilometre race (2,276 miles) in 23 days. The race, a mix of energy-sapping mountain stages and time trial sprints, takes place through France but last year's 101st edition began in England and also went through Belgium with more countries keen to host stages. Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Switzerland, Spain and Luxembourg have also hosted the start of the race in recent years before the riders make their way through France and finish at the traditional end point, the Champs Elysees in Paris.","Tourism Authority of Thailand are in talks with 'Le Tour' organisers .

"San Marino manager Pierangelo Manzaroli admits Thursday's match against England is an exercise in 'damage limitation' but insists his side do deserve their place in the Euro 2016 qualification stage. San Marino are ranked joint 208th with Bhutan in the FIFA World Rankings and have never won a competitive fixture. England are expected to inflict another heavy defeat on Manzaroli's team of part-timers, having scored 26 goals and conceded one in the sides' last four meetings. San Marino manager Pierangelo Manzarol is hoping to keep the score down against England . The San Marino squad trained at Wembley on Wednesday night ahead of the Group E qualifier . 'It will have to be a big effort,' Manzaroli said. 'Playing England is different for us because more often than not it is a matter of damage limitation. 'But we don't rule anything out - you never know when the chance will arrive to get a result.' Manzaroli continued: 'It's going to be a difficult match and the main objective will be to come away without a heavy defeat. 'We also want to try to show what we can do and try to keep the match even for as long as possible.' Alessandro Della Valle looks dejected after putting through his own net against England last year . Daniel Sturridge heaped more misery on minnows back in March 2013 . England still have four more international matches to play in 2014 and of the five other teams drawn in Group E, only Switzerland are ranked inside the world's top 50. It has been suggested struggling sides like San Marino should have to go through a play-off before reaching the qualification stage but Manzaroli disagrees. 'We want to carry on playing in the biggest and best stadiums in Europe and we think it is our right to do that,' Manzaroli said. 'Every time we do, we show we are committed and we give our all so we want to carry on with that. Manzarol has briefed his players to expect another onslaught against Roy Hodgson's side . Manzarol gives instructions during training on Wednesday night . 'If the international schedule is too dense and they want to take some matches away that is up to UEFA. 'But we are a member of UEFA and we think we have as much right as anyone else to play against the big teams.' Manzaroli added: 'It is not easy to start again after every defeat. 'We have shown, however, we always regroup, we never lose heart, we play with passion and perhaps we are a good example of healthy sporting principles in a world when business rules supreme.' San Marino, who have never conceded less than five goals against England, lost their opening Group E fixture 2-0 at home to Lithuania.

"Barclays Premier League managers are hindering young England players' international careers by not supporting them playing for the Under 21s, according to former Three Lions striker Gary Lineker. The Under 21s secured a place at next year's European Championship on Tuesday with a 4-2 aggregate win over Croatia and it has been suggested England should follow the lead of Germany and Spain by fielding more established players at the finals. Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley would all be eligible to play for the Under 21s in the Czech Republic next June but club bosses remain unconvinced. Full internationals Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) and Raheem Sterling could play for the Under 21s next year . Jack Wilshere has 24 senior caps but would also be eligible to play in the Czech Republic next summer . Arsenal's Arsene Wenger and Everton's Roberto Martinez have both voiced concerns about the potential for fatigue and former England striker Lineker expressed his disappointment at the duo's stance. 'Won't happen, but I wish PL managers would support their young players' international careers, not hinder them.' Lineker tweeted, adding a link to Wenger and Martinez's comments. 'All our star under 21 players should go to the finals next summer if fit. Wonderful tournament experience. Other countries insist on it. 'I get managers me, me, me attitude, but wouldn't it be refreshing if, for once, they thought about the good of the national game?' Lineker (centre) had plenty to say on Twitter about how players should come back to the Under 21s . Lineker was on Twitter on Thursday saying 'all our star under 21 players should go to the finals if fit' Germany won the European Championship in 2009, thrashing England 4-0 in the final. Five players who started that match - Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Benedikt Howedes, Mesut Ozil and Mats Hummels - were also part of the German side that beat Argentina 1-0 in the World Cup final earlier this year. Everton boss Martinez, however, believes parachuting senior players into the junior ranks is not the answer, insisting Toffees midfielder Barkley will need a rest at the end of the campaign. Lineker, pictured playing against Poland at the 1986 World Cup, scored 48 goals in 80 games for England . Gareth Southgate could have as many as eight extra players available to select for the Under 21 European Championships next year: . Raheem Sterling, Liverpool . Jack Wilshere, Arsenal . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arsenal . Calum Chambers, Arsenal . Luke Shaw, Manchester United . Phil Jones, Manchester United . John Stones, Everton . Ross Barkley, Everton . 'If the tournament was now, it would be a good opportunity for Ross to get some playing time but if it is at the end of a season where he has played consistently for 10 months then he needs to have a break,' Martinez said. ''We keep talking about players who need to make tournaments but I think we need to start creating a way of playing and that way of playing will demand one player or another. 'It is not because bringing so many good names together will give you a chance of being successful. 'What would be the under-21s' objective - (is it) to get players into the senior side? Because if players are already in the senior side what would be the motivation for a player to go into the under-21s?' Will Hughes (centre) was on target as the Young Lions beat Croatia 4-2 on aggregate to qualify . Roberto Martinez (left) and Arsene Wenger voiced concerns about fatigue in their younger players . 'Sometimes we speak too much about individual names. You need to look into it on an individual case; players who have played too much football, the needs of the team more importantly.' Wenger, who is in charge of a number of young England starlets at Arsenal, is also sceptical. 'Once a guy has moved up to the full national team, (if) you put him down (to the under-21s) he is never good,' Wenger said. 'Apart from on the selfish front for us when a guy has played 50 games, it is better that a guy has a good rest during the summer. 'But most of the time, when they move down, they are not completely at their quality.'

"Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock has told his players to throw caution to the wind and make the most of their attacking talents this season. The Eagles are unbeaten in the league since Warnock took over at the end of August, and have scored 10 goals in his five games in charge. It is a noticeably different approach to that of former boss Tony Pulis, whose success at Selhurst Park last season was firmly centred on a strong work ethic and a mean defence. Mile Jedinak celebrates his goal during the win over Leicester City at Selhurst Park last week . 'You have a way you want your team to play and you try to remind them of what they can do in certain situations and to not always think defensively,' Warnock said. 'I tell them to be positive in what they do - is the glass half empty or half full? It's always half full for me.' Warnock continued: 'I think they can play more attacking. It's about belief, without forgetting their good habits. 'We have genuine lads who are committed and I think sometimes you have to try get that balance - while you want to be solid, I want to entertain as well if I can. 'The goals we've conceded haven't really been down to our opponents' ability - they've been down to elementary mistakes, so we've got to become that compact unit that I know we can be. 'But I also think we can create more so it's about having that belief to let ourselves go a bit more in midfield. Neil Warnock (above) has told his team to be positive on the pitch and follow their attacking instincts . '(James) McArthur can score more goals, Mile Jedinak is a bit more free and I think he can get more goals - it's about them contributing more and not just leaving it to the strikers.' After beating both Everton and Leicester, Palace are looking for their third straight victory in the Barclays Premier League when they travel to Hull on Saturday. Warnock named four forwards on the bench for the Eagles' 2-0 win over the Foxes last weekend and he says that is symptomatic of the fearlessness he wants his players to show on the pitch. Palace are unbeaten in the Premier League since Warnock took over as manager . 'Every one of those forwards I've got at the moment can change the game, whether it's to win a game, calm us down, provide a spark - they've all got different attributes and at my age I'm willing to take that chance,' Warnock said. 'I've come into it to enjoy myself. At this stage of my life and career, that's what I want to do and I want the players to enjoy it if they can. 'We know there will be periods when we don't win for four or five games, but as long as they keep giving me everything I won't have a problem.'","Neil Warnock wants his players to follow their attacking instincts against Hull .

"Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock believes Hull's Steve Bruce deserved to win last season's manager of the year ahead of his Eagles predecessor Tony Pulis. After winning promotion from the Championship, Bruce steered Hull to a 16th-placed finish in the top flight and led the club to its first ever FA Cup final. He was beaten to the top manager's prize, however, by Pulis, who rescued Palace from the bottom three and guided the Eagles to 11th.

Palace travel to Hull on Saturday and Warnock believes his opposite number should have been given more recognition for his success last term. 'I know Tony got manager of the year but I thought Steve Bruce was head and shoulders the best manager around,' Warnock said. 'To make a club like Hull very comfortable in the Premier League and to get to the FA Cup final - I thought that was fantastic. 'He's done an incredible job and he's got fabulous support from his chairman too. 'I know the chairman gets criticism but there aren't many teams in the bottom half who have had as much money put in as Hull. 'He's been fantastic and they've bought some very good players.' Warnock arrived at Selhurst Park at the end of August and Palace are unbeaten in the league since he took over. An impressive 3-2 victory at Everton was followed by a 2-0 win at home to Leicester last weekend, which sees the Eagles sitting ninth in the table. 'I've got nothing to lose and I want my players to enjoy it and not be frightened of expressing themselves in the right areas,' Warnock said. Steve Bruce and Tony Pulis embrace during Hull's clash with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park last season . 'Everyone has got strengths - I'm very lucky because you couldn't ask for more effort and commitment. 'As a Palace fan that's the minimum you require - you want your players to sweat blood and that's what they're doing. 'The fans get behind the players because they know they're trying their hardest. 'It was a difficult start to the season but since then we've worked very hard and we're getting the rewards.' Warnock allowed 20-year-old Jonny Williams to join Ipswich on a 93-day loan deal this week. Williams, who spent three months with the Tractor Boys at the end of last season, has not started a league game for Palace in the current campaign. 'There were four or five clubs after him - I just know Mick (McCarthy) will play him in the hole where I want him to play and he enjoyed it at Ipswich last season as well,' Warnock said. 'He knows I'm watching him and he's playing in the position I think he's better in.

"UEFA's opposition to the Premier League staging fixtures overseas is not likely to change, according to the governing body's general secretary Gianni Infantino. Plans for a '39th game' to be played as far away as Asia, America and Australia were scrapped in 2008 following widespread opposition, including from FIFA and UEFA. The issue reared its head again, however, after Premier League clubs' chairmen discussed the proposal at a recent meeting but Infantino believes UEFA's stance will remain the same. Manchester United duo Darren Fletcher (left) and Wayne Rooney hold aloft the 'Guinness International Champions Cup' after the Red Devils won the pre-season tournament in the United States . United's games abroad draw huge crowds, like this one in Michigan for their clash against Real Madrid . 'We already have some associations who play games abroad so it is part of this wish to export national football overseas,' Infantino said at the Leaders in Sport conference in London. 'We have to bear in mind though that there is a pyramid in place and that whenever these kind of things are discussed we have to act in a responsible way within the rules we've all agreed together. 'Let's see what the decision of UEFA is on this. I don't think it will change, it would have to be discussed, but I don't think it will change.' Any fixtures played overseas would need the approval of the host nation, the relevant confederation and FIFA. Vincent Kompany  plays the ball out of the back as Manchester City take on Chelsea in New York last year . UEFA would only have jurisdiction over a fixture staged outside England if it was played elsewhere in Europe. Bundesliga chief executive Christian Seifert insists such a proposal would never get off the ground in Germany and suspects FIFA would have objections too. 'I think it's a creative idea, I'm not sure it would work with FIFA,' Seifert said. ''We have a completely different approach about our idea of German football. 'For the financial side it would be maybe a good idea to play a match all over the world, but for the supporters who are visiting 34 games of that club, no matter if it's snow or rain or wind or whatever and they're travelling. Gianni Infantino addresses his audience at the Leaders in Sport conference in London . 'And on that game that has the impact that the team is going to be relegated and they cannot be there, because it's in Thailand - I think this would not be an approach for the Bundesliga.'

"Rio Ferdinand has all the qualities to be 'another Michel Platini' and take up a role running the game, according to QPR boss Harry Redknapp. Ferdinand is in contention to be the Football Association's candidate for Britain's FIFA vice-presidential position despite his current playing commitments at Loftus Road. The 35-year-old defender is coming to the end of an illustrious playing career that has included winning six Premier League titles, the Champions League and playing at two World Cups. Harry Redknapp believes  QPR defender Rio Ferdinand could help run the game when he retires . Ferdinand has endured a tough start to life at Loftus Road but is well respected within world football . Ferdinand spent seven years under Redknapp's tutelage at West Ham and the now-QPR boss has no doubt the former Manchester United defender has a lot to offer the game once he hangs up his boots. 'He could be another Michel Platini (UEFA president) - that'd be nice for him and why not?' Redknapp said. 'He's a bright boy and a lovely guy - an absolute class act on and off the field - he's smart and a top boy.' Ferdinand, who grew up in Peckham in south London, has shown a strong interest in community work in the past. The centre back (right) has set up The Rio Ferdinand Foundation to help support young children . He set up The Rio Ferdinand Foundation, which uses role models to help children in education and employment, as well as taking an active role in anti-racism, Aids awareness and child literacy campaigns. 'We need more people like him running the game,' Redknapp said. 'He's got great knowledge of the game and is a great role model. 'He's come out of a working class area in south London area and he's made it. 'I've known him since he was 14 and he's a fantastic boy and he hasn't changed a bit as a person, he's just got a bit more experience now but as a person he's top class.' Ferdinand has played every minute of QPR's five league games so far and is set to start at the heart of the defence for Saturday's trip to high-flying Southampton. Michel Platini was one of the best footballers in the world before becoming UEFA president after retiring . The Frenchman in his heyday, playing for Juventus in 1987 at the peak of his playmaking powers . The veteran has predominantly been used in a central defensive trio this season and while Redknapp reverted to a back four against Stoke last weekend, the QPR boss says 3-5-2 remains an option. 'I had thought about it this week, it's in my mind,' Redknapp said. 'I spoke to the coaches, we had a meeting and chatted about it - it's something that I wouldn't discard. 'I bought the little right back Mauricio Isla in to play right wing back from Juventus and Armand Traore is a left wing back really. 'I've also got five centre halves and I like all of them - to play three of them would suit us fine.' QPR face a tough trip to Ronald Koeman's Southampton this weekend, who have started the season superbly . Southampton have dispelled doubts surrounding their summer transfer policy by taking 10 points from their opening five games and beating Arsenal in the Capital One cup on Tuesday. The Saints' excellent start under new boss Ronald Koeman sees them sitting second in the  Premier League table, three points behind Chelsea. 'I've been very surprised at how well they've done, it's been amazing,' said Redknapp, who managed Southampton for a year from December 2004. 'They keep producing good players there, they've got this conveyor belt of kids coming through. 'They've bought well - Ronald Koeman has got a couple of good players from Holland that he knew and they're a powerful outfit again.'","Harry Redknapp believes QPR defender Rio Ferdinand is suited to a job in football administration .

'The fans know how it was when we were in administration - it was very difficult to keep the boat rolling.' He added: 'When I came back with QPR I thought I'd get a bit of stick. 'It was probably the most emotional day I've ever had in my life because the majority of the ground was behind me. 'It was a fabulous day for me so it's nice to get the opportunity now, when it's a bit hectic again, to try to steady the ship.' Pulis was named the Barclays Premier League manager of the season after leading Palace to 11th place in the table and the players were disappointed with his exit 48 hours before the start of the campaign. Warnock, however, insists there has been no bitterness towards him and has backed his players to prove the doubters wrong. 'I think they had a great time with Tony,' Warnock said. 'I'm sure certain people think we might plummet now we've got new people on board but I don't see that. 'I look at where these players finished in the league table and I think they warranted that - if anything I think we're even better now.'

Palace are open to sending some of their fringe players out on loan, including Paddy McCarthy and Peter Rammage, but Warnock says he is happy with the balance of his squad. 'We were looking for players that weren't going to disrupt anything already here because the dressing room is probably the most important thing,' he said. 'I'm just looking forward to the game now and seeing how we play and it'll be nice with the crowd - Selhurst Park is a very special place.

"UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino has defended the expansion of the European Championship, insisting more teams and multiple host countries will 'inject the virus of football' throughout the continent. The championship has been expanded from 16 to 24 teams for Euro 2016 while the 2020 tournament will be held in 13 different countries. The new format for 2020 is a one-off measure to celebrate the 60th anniversary of European competition but there is concern that multiple host nations will reduce enthusiasm and atmosphere during the event. VIDEO Scroll down for UEFA boss Gianni Infantino on European Championship changes . UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino claims the reforms have added a new dynamic to the Euros . 'It's a great concept,' Infantino said. 'We always have great parties when the Euros are hosted in one country but now our ambition is to organise a Euros for Europe. 'We want to inject the virus of football in the whole of Europe. 'In the 13 cities, people will feel the Euros belongs to them and it gives countries who have never hosted, the chance to host. 'They have the chance to build a new stadium and boost the development of football in their own country.' London's Wembley has won the right to host both the semi-finals and the final at Euro 2020 but other, less renowned football cities, will hold matches including Baku in Azerbaijan, Budapest in Hungary and St Petersburg in Russia. Wembley stadium in London has won the right to host the semi-finals and final at Euro 2020 . None of those three cities have ever held a European finals fixture before but there is concern that local interest will dwindle if host countries are knocked out or fail to qualify. 'Even if the national team do not participate I think there will be an enthusiasm for hosting a European Championship,' Infantino said. 'These are countries who have never organised a Euro and who would never be able to organise a Euro. 'And we have seen in the Euros before when host teams go out there is still an enthusiasm for the games.' Adding eight more countries to the 2016 finals means two sides now automatically qualify, with third-placed teams earning a play-off spot. Marseille's Stade Velodrome has been upgraded with a capacity of 67,500 and will host matches in Euro 2016 . The changes have given more hope to sides previously unlikely to go through but it has also reduced the competitiveness of the qualification stage for more established countries. 'The effect of 24 teams qualifying makes almost all the teams think they have a chance to qualify and that has created a new dynamic,' Infantino said. 'We saw Cyprus beating Bosnia, the Czech Republic beating the Netherlands, Albania beating Portugal in Portugal. 'It creates a new dynamic and it can make the qualification process even more interesting.' Infantino added: 'You develop football in Europe not only by developing football in a couple of countries but by making sure the whole of Europe feels integrated.

Monk's side have enjoyed an excellent start to the campaign and currently sit fifth in the table, level on points with Manchester United. The Swans' momentum has, however, slowed in recent weeks with the team winless in their last four league matches. Garry Monk said Swansea's players need self-belief ahead of their Premier League clash with Stoke City . 'Stoke is never an easy place to go and we know we have never won there in the Premier League,' Monk told Swansea's official club website. 'However, we should have won the last time we played there in February, so hopefully we can repeat that performance and get the victory. 'They (Stoke) try and play football but they still have that direct aspect of their game, which makes them dangerous. 'We have to go there with belief and impose ourselves on the game.' Swansea have started the season well and are currently fifth but have failed to win in their last four games . Swansea will be looking to get back to winning ways as soon as possible, having recorded consecutive draws against Newcastle and Sunderland.

'It's the same for every team but we will give the players all the information they need in order to be ready for Sunday's game,' Monk added. 'It's difficult when half the squad is away, but we have still had a lot of players who have featured in the first team on a regular basis so we've managed to do plenty of offensive and defensive work.'

"George Groves overcame his shattering defeat to Carl Froch by replaying the moment he was knocked out nine times the next morning. Groves, who was floored in the eighth round against Froch in May, is hoping to lay the demons to rest when he fights Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse on September 20. The bout will serve as a final WBC title eliminator but it has added importance for Groves, who is looking for rejuvenation after his loss to Froch in front of 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium. Groves watched the fight back three times that same night and trainer Paddy Fitzpatrick made his pupil go through it all again the following morning. Carl Froch is ready to return to the ring for the first time since his defeat to Carl Froch . He will take on Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse on September 20 in a WBC title eliminator . Fitzpatrick said: 'I went over the next morning and we watched the fight again and then I took a gamble and rewound it - we watched it nine times and George looked at me as if to say ""all right"". 'I brought up as many emotions as I could so he could deal with them earlier.' Fitzpatrick continued: 'I didn't just watch it nine times with my arms round him - we looked at it and asked why it happened. Carl Froch defeated George Groves in eight rounds at Wembley Stadium in May in front of 80,000 fans . 'I wanted him to feel the emotion early and deal with it, like when you get a brown envelope through the door and you don't open it because you know it's bad news. 'You have to deal with it before you can move on.' Groves spent the following week away in Dubai with his wife Sophie and says it was important to come to terms with the Froch defeat before considering his next move. 'I didn't realise Paddy was testing me but it was fine,' Groves said. 'You can't talk about being a realist and then shy away from it. I didn't get angry, it was just frustrating. I was still pretty numb. 'I took time away and the rest of the week was difficult but by the time I got home I wanted to get back to work.' The animosity between Froch and Groves that drew so much attention in the build-up to both fights has not cooled over the past four months. George Groves throws a left hook at Carl Froch during their super fight in London . Froch unblocked his opponent on Twitter but otherwise there has been no contact between the pair, which leads Groves to believe there could be a third fight in the future. 'Carl doesn't like me and that's fine, he'll have a swipe at me at every moment,' Groves said. 'He's certainly not satisfied after the last fight and I wonder why - if I knocked somebody out I'd be pretty satisfied with it. But he's not, he can't put it to bed. 'For that reason only, I think there might be a third fight because he doesn't like me. 'For whatever reason - perhaps he said more prayers than I did - he came out with two wins in a fight I said he couldn't win. 'I don't need to be Carl Froch's friend and I don't plan to be.' Groves also endures a frosty relationship with James DeGale after he inflicted the first loss of DeGale's professional career in 2011. 'Fighters don't like me and I think it's because if you watch me box, everyone thinks I'm s***,' Groves said. Carl Froch looks over George Groves after a knock down in their grudge match in May . 'And I'm happy to talk back to an opponent or a rival and pull them apart when sometimes boxing etiquette is to smile and nod along. 'I can be humble and I can be a realist and tell the truth - and I usually go out and deliver as well. That's probably what upsets everyone.' The winner of Groves and Rebrasse will become the mandatory challenger to American Anthony Dirrell for the WBC super-middleweight world title. Rebrasse has recorded 22 wins, two defeats and three draws in his career so far but the 32-year-old goes into the fight at Wembley Arena as underdog. 'He's a champion, he has a good track record and he has never been stopped,' Groves said. 'He is coming as a European champion and he has dreams and ambitions and that makes him dangerous. 'I think I am better than him and I need to let him know that but I wont be gung-ho, I won't go in swinging.' Groves added: 'For my own sanity rather than my reputation, I don't want to lose. I'm fully capable of winning and I will win.'","George Groves returns to the ring against France's Christopher Rebrasse .

"Rio Ferdinand admits he was ready to turn to a television career and retire from football before Harry Redknapp offered to bring him to QPR this summer. Ferdinand, who turns 36 in November, was allowed to leave Manchester United at the end of last season after 12 successful years at Old Trafford. The defender was a free agent while he worked as a television pundit at the World Cup in Brazil and although several offers came from England and abroad, he was preparing to hang up his boots before Rangers came in. VIDEO Scroll down for Rio Ferdinand: Finishing career with Harry Redknapp is a fairytale .

New signing: Ferdinand poses with Harry Redknapp and his new No 5 shirt at QPR on Monday . Leading the way: Ferdinand spoke to the press about the coming season with his new club in London . Eager to get started: The former Manchester United man and his new boss listen in to the questions . 'If I had not come back to a team in London, I probably would have retired,' Ferdinand said. 'I would have done TV, maybe coaching. I enjoyed the TV work in the summer so I would have done more of that.' He . continued: 'My representatives spoke to a few teams out in America, the . Middle East and Europe as well but the main thing was getting back to . London and when Harry gave me the call, all bets were off.' Ferdinand . is reported to have taken a significant wage cut to join Redknapp's . side and the 35-year-old insists he has a special affection for QPR, . having played at the club as a boy. 'I could have earned a lot more money elsewhere but the money has never been an issue for me,' Ferdinand said. 'People sometimes forget that when you are a kid, you play football because you love playing football. 'This . was not about money, it was about playing in a competitive league, in . London, for a team I have an affinity with from years ago. 'This was the first club I ever went to as a kid.' Considered answers: Ferdinand addressed some issues about his time at United during the conference . Ferdinand . left Rangers as a teenager for West Ham after being spotted playing for . the district team by Frank Lampard senior, who was on the Hammers' coaching staff at the time. Redknapp . took over as manager at Upton Park not long after and he handed . Ferdinand his first-team debut in May 1996, bringing the centre half on . as a substitute in a 1-1 draw with Sheffield Wednesday on the final day . of the season. 'Any player . will tell you, if a manager gives you your first chance in football, . they will always hold a place in your heart,' Ferdinand said. 'Harry was always supporting me, singing my praises, telling me off when I needed to be told off.' Ferdinand . continued: 'We've stayed in contact ever since. We would sometimes go . six months without speaking but when I've seen him it's like it was back . in the day. 'There has always been a connection. He has not changed much, he has not even got any grey hairs.' The . former United man is likely to be paired in central defence alongside . Steven Caulker, who has been brought in from Cardiff and is 13 years . Ferdinand's junior. Despite . being let go by United, records showed Ferdinand was the fourth highest . in the Red Devils squad last season when it came to being fit and . available for match selection. 'Some . people question my fitness but over the last two years I have been one . of the most ever-present in terms of training and games,' Ferdinand . said. 'I thought I could play every Premier League game last season when I was at Manchester United but it was not to be.

'The . amount of experience I have got, if I can be of help to the young . player here by the way I train, the way I conduct myself, then that is . great.' Ferdinand won six . Premier League titles, an FA Cup and a Champions League trophy during . his stay at Old Trafford and has been capped 81 times for England. A . potential relegation battle at Loftus Road will pose a different . challenge to what he has been used to previously but Ferdinand insists . survival with QPR would be another achievement to add to his list. 'All . I play for is winning trophies - I am not silly enough to think we are . going to win the title but hopefully we can have a good cup run,' Ferdinand said. 'I will not be feeling that buzz here but staying up will be an unbelievable achievement. 'If I had gone to some of the clubs who were interested in me, there would not have been anything to play for. 'Staying in the Premier League would be an amazing achievement.' Ferdinand remains open to the possibility of a coaching career after he retires. He is currently completing his qualification badges but will focus entirely on playing while at QPR this season. 'He brings a bit of class to the place,' Redknapp said. 'He's a class act on and off the field. 'On . the training ground he'll be a great role model - the way he conducts . himself, the way he trains, the way he looks after himself.

'The . main aim for the club is obviously to stay in the Premier League but we . want to push on even further and get the club back into the Europa .

"Ronald Koeman insists Southampton will no longer be a selling club and has told wantaway defender Dejan Lovren he was wrong to make public his desire to leave the Saints. Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw have already departed St Mary's this summer and at his unveiling as Saints boss on Friday, Koeman was pressed on other key players who have been linked with moves away. The former Barcelona defender is hopeful he will be able to keep Lovren, as well as midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, insisting the club are determined to hold on to their prize assets from now on. VIDEO Scroll down for new Southampton boss Ronald Koeman's first press conference . New arrival: Ronald Koeman was officially unveiled as Southampton manager on Friday . Together: Koeman wants to keep the remainder of his squad following three high-profile out-goings . Wantaway: Koeman insisted that he wants to keep defender Dejan Lovren and his other key squad members . 'The first meeting with (executive director) Les Reed was open and clear,' Koeman said. 'I knew about Lambert, Lallana and Shaw but after that we said, ""OK, we are not a selling club - we want to keep the rest of the good players and bring new players in"". 'We will continue with the Southampton philosophy which means we like to bring in young players and to continue what they did last season. 'They had a fantastic season last season and still we have ambition to go forward.' Earlier this week, Lovren expressed his anger that Southampton had not informed him of a bid from Liverpool. The centre-half was a key part of the Saints' success last season under departed manager Mauricio Pochettino and he is due to return to the club on Sunday before the squad leave for a pre-season tour of Belgium. 'I spoke to Dejan twice and he was very clear about his situation,' Koeman said. Anfield awaits: Attacking midfielder Adam Lallana moved to Liverpool for £25million . Gone: Rickie Lambert moved to boyhood club Liverpool for £4million this summer . Farewell: England eft-back Luke Shaw moved to Manchester United for £30million . Staying put: Lovren (centre) wants to go to Liverpool but Koeman does not want anymore out-goings . 'I am the new manager I want to keep all the good players - I want to keep Dejan in the team because he is an important player in the team. 'We have to do what the best is for the club. He has a contract, he has to come back this Sunday but I don't know what will happen after this. 'It's football and there is a lot of movement but first of all we like to keep all that information in the club and not in the press. That was not a good thing of his side.' Koeman added: 'I wasn't happy with his comments in the press.That is not good for the club, for the rest of the players or for himself and we will speak about whether to fine him or not.' Schneiderlin has been on World Cup duty with France, who were knocked out by Germany in the quarter-finals last week.

All smiles: New Saints boss Koeman was in good spirits during his first press conference in charge . 'We don't have any bids for Schneiderlin,' Koeman said. 'He is a Southampton player and he will stay a Southampton player.' Koeman was less certain on the future of Dani Osvaldo, who has failed to return for pre-season. The troublesome striker was involved in an incident with team-mate Jose Fonte in training in January and spent the second half of last season on loan at Juventus. 'Osvaldo has a contract,' Koeman said. 'What happened last season I don't know, it wasn't my problem. I like to have a really good atmosphere in the team but he hasn't been at Southampton when he was meant to be at Southampton. 'We heard from his agent that he was ill - I haven't spoken to him. 'We will go to Belgium on Sunday and he will come back to train on his own because he is too late and then he will have to speak to the club.' Uncertain: The future of forward Dani Osvaldo is unclear after he failed to return for pre-season training . Progress: Koeman wants to build on Southampton's success from last season and move forward . Wanted: Koeman is interested in signing Serbian attacking midfielder Dusan Tadic . Southampton's big-money sales have bolstered the club's transfer budget and Koeman has been assured he will be able to reinvest the money into the team. The Dutch boss has already signed attacking midfielder Dusan Tadic as a replacement for Lallana and a deal is close for striker Graziano Pelle, who he worked with at Feyenoord. 'We are looking at the positions in the squad and we are happy we have Tadic as a new player,' Koeman said. 'Lallana is a great player in this position and we had some other possibilities but Tadic is a great player, a player who scores and makes assists.' On Pelle, Koeman added: 'A deal is close - it's still not signed but it's coming close. We hope this weekend to have him as the second new player of Southampton.'

"Defender Chris Smalling insists England will not be changing their style of play to suit the sweltering conditions at this summer’s World Cup in Brazil. Roy Hodgson’s side start the tournament against Italy in the challenging Amazonian climate of Manaus, where temperatures are expected to exceed 30 degrees celsius and humidity regularly soars above 75 per cent. The players wore extra layers during sessions in Portugal last week to sweat more and simulate warmer conditions but Smalling is adamant that come June 14, England will not be doing anything differently. Fighting fit: England defender Chris Smailling insists England are ready for the heat in Brazil . Sofa time: Daniel Sturridge, Chris Smalling, Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson attend the opening of Nike Phenomemal House . 'We’ve been wearing about four different layers in training, everyone has been sweating a lot more and that seems to be working - anything that makes us more ready, we’ll do it,' the Manchester United defender said. 'But I think each country - and especially us - will play their normal game. 'Our attacking force is all about pace and running at people and this squad has got that in abundance. 'We won’t be changing our style for the conditions. We just want to make sure we’re ready to play our game. 'We’re going to go into each match the same way and if everyone can pull off what they’ve doing for their clubs, it’s going to be exciting.' Hodgson has put faith in a host of young talents, with just five players on the plane to Brazil aged 29 or older. Where in previous tournaments England have placed their hopes on a number of world-renowned stars, this time it may be up to the likes of Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling, Adam Lallana and Ross Barkley to carry the Three Lions through. Taking on some responsibility: Glen Johnson (next to Wayne Rooney) is ready to set an example for England . Smalling believes being an unknown quantity could turn out to be England’s trump card. 'There’s so much potential in the squad - there’s that unknown factor about England,' he said. 'If everything comes together, we can take teams by surprise with our pace and attacking instincts and then who knows how far we can go? 'I think there’s that possibility where nobody is sure what England are about and if players can play to their potential you never know what can happen.' England fulfilling their attacking promise may depend on how bold Hodgson is prepared to be with his tactics and team selection. Smalling, who previously worked under the England boss as a teenager at Fulham, is adamant Hodgson has all the qualities needed to get the best out of the young talents at his disposal. 'He has got that attacking instinct,' Smalling said. 'He’s bold enough to put those attacking players out on the pitch; he wouldn’t have chosen them if he didn’t want to do that.' Helping hand: England skipper Steven Gerrard will need his senior players to aid him out in Brazil next month . Smalling said of the England manager: 'He talks to the guys one to one a lot - he will talk to everyone as a group and then during sessions he will pull you aside on your own or maybe in groups, whether it be the defenders or midfielders or whatever. 'He’s very approachable - I found that from my days at Fulham and even more now at England. 'He’s a guy you can always talk to, if you ever need advice he’s always there and that’s important for young players.' England play Peru at Wembley on Friday before further warm-up matches against Ecuador and Honduras. 'I know Roy Hodgson has chosen me mainly for that centre back spot and that’s my position,' Smalling said. 'I’m going to be really vying for that place, training hard and staking a claim for that centre-back spot. 'I . can obviously play right-back when needed and this season we’ve . struggled with injuries there so I’ve stepped in, but I think the . manager knows that’s centre-back is my best position.' Smalling . added: 'There’s places up for grabs - there’s 11 shirts available for . that first game against Italy and these next three warm-up matches will . give the manager a good indication of who he wants to select.'

Scotland face the Super Eagles at Craven Cottage in the team's final scheduled fixture before they kick off their European Championship qualification campaign against Germany on September 7.

'The enthusiasm you get from the players keeps your battery going as a coach and I like working with them.' He added: 'The lads are full of enthusiasm, which is great, and it's easy to coach when the players are like that. 'The enthusiasm rubs off on me, it's great and I enjoy it.'

'It can be the best day of your life or the worst day of your life but we've seen clubs in the Championship who have got close to promotion bounce back the year after.

"England midfielder Fabian Delph will be out for two months after dislocating his shoulder in a freak training accident. The star of Aston Villa’s bright start to the season has been told he needs surgery to repair the damage caused when he fell awkwardly during a session on Tuesday. Delph, 25, will miss England’s next Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia, the friendly in Scotland and nine Villa games. Fabian Delph,  pictured challenging for the ball with David Silva, will miss Aston Villa's next 12 games . Delph took to Instagram to tell his fans he was remaining positive and that his injury is a 'minor setback' Delph impressed in midfield during England's narrow 1-0 win in Estonia last week .

The accident is untimely for Delph as the central midfielder has been in excellent form for club and country during the first few months of the season. ‘Nobody was near him when he did it,’ said Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert. ‘He fell on his shoulder and we need to get it checked out.’ It’s an extra problem for Lambert, who is already facing the potential loss of captain Ron Vlaar in January with Manchester United considering a bid. The Dutch World Cup star is in the last year of his contract and Lambert says Villa are ‘doing everything’ to keep him in talks which could double his £25,000 a week wages. Delph has also yet to sign a new deal, and Lambert said: ‘There will come a stage where I might go to (chairman Randy Lerner) and say, “That’s what they are looking for” and negotiate from there.’ Aston Villa are bracing themselves for a bid from Manchester United for Ron Vlaar (right)","England international Fabian Delph has been ruled out for three months .

"Brendan Rodgers believes Euro 2015 duty with England's Under-21s would not dent Raheem Sterling's long-term development. The Liverpool manager will reserve judgement until the end of the Premier League season on whether the England wing will be fresh enough to compete in the Czech Republic with Gareth Southgate's side. Roy Hodgson came under fire for deciding to use 19-year-old Sterling sparingly across the England senior side's Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia, prompting widespread inquests into player burnout. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling (L) will be eligible to play for England U21s at Euro 2015 . The Reds youngster resumed training at Melwood after returning from the international break . Brendan Rodgers, pictured with Mario Balotelli, believes Sterling can benefit from playing for the U21s . Anfield boss Rodgers said England should take their strongest-available age-group side to next summer's European competition - full caps like Sterling included - fitness and freshness permitting. 'We assess that come the end of the season,' Rodgers said. 'I think it is a relevant point for England: If they are going to improve internationally there has to be more focus given to the Under-21s team. 'I think Gareth is doing an excellent job there, allowing the players to develop and hopefully getting into the first team. 'Raheem is still eligible to play but I think there are a number of young players that break through that can fit into that age group and I don't think it would do them any harm at all if they went and experienced a competition like that surrounded by top players. 'If they were good enough to go on and win that tournament that would not hold back their development.'

Jose Mourinho pledged Chelsea's support for any player heading off for any level of international duty, a day after Everton boss Roberto Martinez questioned the wisdom of heaping extra duties on young stars already involved in England's senior set-up. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet and Hull manager Steve Bruce challenged England's hierarchy and players to put politics aside and mount a serious title bid next summer. Former Uruguay midfielder Poyet said he has 'no doubt' Black Cats star Connor Wickham would want to play a part in the Czech Republic tournament. 'Yes he would, I have no doubt,' said Poyet on Wickham. 'And if on top of that you have got a chance to win something with your national team, that's the maximum you can aim for as a football player. Jose Mourinho (R) has backed any international call-ups while Roberto Martinez (L) is less enthusiastic . 'I don't think the debate here is if the Under 21s should play with the Under 21s or the first-team, it should be: do you want to win the tournament? 'That's up to you. I know what I would do.' Ex-Manchester United defender Bruce said England must start picking from strength at Under 21 level in a bid for global success at senior level. 'There will be managers jumping up and down that they don't want their young players having a summer of all football again which you can understand as a manager,' said Bruce. 'However tied with that is the international scene and we'd love to see the Under 21s team lift a trophy, the international team do well. Hull manager Steve Bruce insists England should make a concerted effort to win the Under 21 tournament . 'We have to start putting things in place that we are going to play our best Under 21s team, that's the way forward for me. 'I would like to see our international team progress. 'We haven't won a tournament in years. We (Hull) have got one or two now, Tom Ince in particular, around the U21s, and I can't see any reason why you'd want to not let him play. That would be totally selfish but we are like that as managers. 'But if we want our international team to succeed we have to let our young players play in the big tournaments.

"New Manchester United signing Daley Blind has revealed how Old Trafford legend Sir Bobby Charlton still visits Louis van Gaal's team in the dressing room after every single game. Much has been made recently of former manager Sir Alex Ferguson's relationship with the new boss at Old Trafford, with Ferguson revealing he has kept his distance from the Dutch veteran. But it seems Sir Bobby is continuing to use his presence to try and inspire players as Van Gaal adjusts to life at his new club. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sir Bobby Charlton: United recovery will be a great adventure . Manchester United legend Sir Bobby Charlton (right) with the club's manager Louis van Gaal . Charlton scores one goal of a glorious career against Manchester City at Maine Road in November 1969 . Sir Alex Ferguson is, unlike Charlton, keeping his distance from the players by watching from the stands . Blind – a summer signing from Ajax – said: 'It is nice to see some traditions still alive and going strong at United like, for example, the visits of Bobby Charlton in the dressing room after every game. 'Sir Bobby doesn't speak much, but he is there, standing. 'He is a living legend of his club and it means something to us that he comes.' Sir Bobby has just celebrated his 77th birthday and remains an important figure at United. Recently he was taken to hospital after suffering severe stomach pains while playing golf in an event in Scotland but has now returned to his normal ambassadorial duties at the club. As for Blind, he continues to impress people at United with his simple football, drawing comparisons with vice-captain Darren Fletcher from Ferguson himself recently. Now back from international duty, where Blind played at left-back as Holland suffered a crushing Euro 2016 qualifying defeat to Iceland, the utility player believes he is already making himself comfortable among the big signings at Old Trafford. Daley Blind (left) has settled in to life at Old Trafford with ease and already is a lynchpin of the midfield . Blind was in action for Holland this week during their shock defeat by Iceland in Reykjavik . A product of the famous Ajax youth system, the 24-year-old also believes the education he received at the Amsterdam club has prepared him for the pressures of playing for United. Blind said: 'I suppose we have been raised with the Amsterdamse bluf [confidence]. 'I'm not a player United bought for €75million like Angel di Maria, but that doesn't make me a shy boy in the dressing room and on the training pitch. 'It's the Amsterdamse bluf that gives me that.' Blind will be in Van Gaal's team when they travel to the Black Country to face West Brom on Monday night in the Barclays Premier League. The start of a three-game run that also sees United face Chelsea and then Manchester City, it seems certain to test the team's resolve in the wake of their recent climb to fourth place in the table. Former United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who also came through the ranks at Ajax and is a member of the club's management board, was also full of praise for Blind. 'The steps he has made here in 18 months have been immense and we always try to develop multi-functional players and that benefitted him,' said the Old Trafford great. 'That multi-functionality helped him. 'With him in the middle he has more feeling for the space around him and what he can and can't do.'","Daley Blind gives insight on Sir Bobby Charlton's role at Old Trafford .

"Manchester United's stars are being worked harder in training than ever before by new manager Louis van Gaal, club insiders have revealed... and here is the evidence. Such is Van Gaal's ferocious desire to fast track the players he inherited from David Moyes on to the levels he desires that Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Juan Mata and Co are being driven relentlessly by the Dutch coach on a daily basis. And the United squad were pictured being put through their paces on Thursday, in scenes reminiscent of a pre-season training camp. Louis van Gaal keeps a watch on Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick as they're put through their paces . Rooney and his strike partner Robin van Persie are pictured lifting weights at United's Carrington HQ . Van Persie leads his team-mate through a set of leg exercises designed to improve their core fitness . Radamel Falcao, who arrived from Monaco on deadline day, lifts weights at United's training headquarters . Rooney, Van Persie and new signing Radamel Falcao were among those lifting weights and taking part in numerous training drills ahead of their home clash against Everton on Sunday. Chief among Van Gaal's methods as he tries to bring about fundamental change at Old Trafford are incessant passing drills that see the United players put through endless repetitive routines aimed at honing and developing new instincts. Van Gaal has spoken of how he wishes his players to think differently and react differently when they are in possession. By putting them through these endless drills, he hopes they will use the ball better and will eventually make better decisions without even seeming to think. The new United manager has also shown himself to be a lover of double training sessions. Van Gaal asked his squad to train twice-a-day regularly on pre-season tour of America as he sought to change his players' thoughts and instincts quickly. That practice has continued to an extent, though, now that the Barclays Premier League season has started and it's not unusual for players to train late in the morning, rest in the sleep unit that was installed last year at Carrington and then train again in the afternoon. 'It can seem relentless but the players understand why Louis is doing it,' said a club source earlier this week. Darren Fletcher and Van Persie appear to show the strain of the new training sessions at Carrington . Van Gaal chats with United vice-captain Darren Fletcher ahead of their weekend clash against Everton . Louis van Gaal was spotted leaving the Lowry Hotel in Manchester on Tuesday morning .

Van Persie (right, with Radamel Falcao) has praised the methods of Van Gaal . Manchester United's players have often been sleeping at Carrington between double training sessions . 'The passing drills are incredible. It's just ""pass, pass, pass"" until the manager and his coaches think the players are beginning to do it almost naturally and instinctively.' Van Persie – who played under van Gaal for two years for the Dutch national team – said on Wednesday that some of the United manager's sessions are 'incredible', with players having to be focused during 'every single minute'. It is also understood that another of Van Gaal's policies is to play full-sided 11 v 11 games for 45 minutes two days before a game. This game is required to be of the intensity of a Premier League game and is aimed at preparing the players mentally and physically for the competitive game that is due to follow 48 hours later. Wayne Rooney (left, with coach Marcel Bout) and his United team-mates are said to be pleased with training . Luke Shaw (left) and Falcao are two new signings adapting to Louis van Gaal's training methods . It is not unusual for managers to play full-sided games in training as it allows the weekend's anticipated first team the opportunity to get used to each other and grow familiarity. However, they are usually played at half or three-quarter pace and full-on contact is minimal as managers are generally paranoid about injuries. What has struck the United players about Van Gaal's 45 minute games, though, has been the intensity. To play these games at full pace is rare but Van Gaal insists on it so that his players are 'match ready' when the actual competitive fixture comes around two days later. During his time in England – and indeed during the World Cup – Van Gaal has shown himself to be surprisingly open about injuries and fitness issues. Most managers like to hide problems from the public so as to keep the opposition guessing and will sometimes exaggerate minor knocks to fool rivals in to thinking star players aren't available. Van Gaal doesn't do this but the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach is obsessively secretive about his team shapes and training drills to the extent that he will only allow players and staff absolutely vital to the session anywhere near the Carrington pitches when the first team are working. Other Carrington staff are asked to stay away so that Van Gaal can go about his business in private before players are handed individual dvds and dossiers of their training performances to watch later with United's performance staff and even at home in their spare time.

"Manchester United have confirmed that former first team fitness coach Tony Strudwick has moved to a role working predominantly with the club’s younger players. Sportsmail revealed on Saturday that Strudwick’s job in charge of first team fitness work and planning had been taken by manager Louis van Gaal’s trusted aide Jos van Dijk. This switch was made at the start of the season. Now United have confirmed the move, revealing that Strudwick’s new title is head of athletic development. Manchester United fitness coach Tony Strudwick is no longer working with Louis van Gaal's first team stars . United said: 'At the start of this season Tony took on the role of head of athletic development. 'Tony is now overseeing the athletic development of all players, working with Louis van Gaal for the first team right through to Paul McGuinness in the Academy. 'Introducing this new role and using Tony’s invaluable experience in sports science, which spans over 20 years, shows the club’s commitment on placing greater emphasis on developing players for long-term success.' Strudwick will become Head of Athletic Development at the club, working with the club's youth players . Jos van Dijk (left) worked with Louis van Gaal for the Netherlands and has taken over first team fitness duties . As reported here on Saturday, Strudwick’s work with the first team is now restricted to some warm up drills before training at Carrington and some strength work. He no longer has responsibilities on match day or takes charge of planning fitness programmes for first team stars, the role he had enjoyed at the club since arriving from Blackburn in 2007. Strudwick said: 'I am thoroughly enjoying this new role. With increased importance on developing players for the future, the athletic component becomes critical in their advancement and to have the chance to work with the younger players, who are in the early stages of their career, as well as the first team, will give a continuity of progression which is critical to their future success.'

"It doesn't seem that long since Manchester United's capitulation at Everton last April signalled the end of David Moyes' unhappy tenure at Manchester United. Now, as Everton prepare to visit Old Trafford on Sunday, it is perhaps time for Louis van Gaal's new United team to reveal its true self. Such has been the scale and speed of change since that awful day on Merseyside less than six months ago that only two players selected by Moyes at Goodison Park - David de Gea,and Juan Mata - can expect to start on Sunday. Six members of the 18, meanwhile, no longer play for the club. VIDEO Scroll down for the great Manchester United players exodus . Manchester United's last game against Everton was David Moyes' last match in charge . Wayne Rooney looks dejected during the 2-0 defeat at Goodison Park last April . Louis van Gaal watches on during training... United's biggest test this season comes this Sunday . It has been a remarkable period at Old Trafford. A club for which stability became a byword during Sir Alex Ferguson's years has perhaps not seen a time like it since the great Scot himself arrived in the mid-1980s and began dismantling what he believed had become a glorified social club under Ron Atkinson. On his arrival this summer, new United manager Louis van Gaal asked for a little time. Three months, he said, and, though we are not at that self-imposed deadline yet, it is perhaps time that we began to see a little more of a 'philosophy' that Van Gaal often talks about but has thus far not been convincingly revealed by his team's football. To look at United's first team these days is to look upon a forward line that can look as though it has been hewn from a fantasy football league. They can play like that, too, even if this weekend's line-up will miss Wayne Rooney through suspension and Ander Herrera through injury. Moyes shakes hands with his successor at Everton, Roberto Martinez prior to the game . David de Gea (left) and Juan Mata (right) could be the only two who survive the cut . Captain Wayne Rooney will miss out after he was sent off against West Ham on Saturday . The England striker is suspended after needlessly hacking down Stewart Downing . Louis van Gaal will have Radamel Falcao at his disposal once again this weekend . United's first game post-transfer window was at home to QPR. Initially a game scheduled to feature supporter protests about a lack of spending, United's late flurry of August spending was ultimately reflected by a 4-0 victory featuring cameos from Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao. Elsewhere in their squad, though, United still look paper thin, especially at centre half. This has been reflected in a startling 5-3 defeat at Leicester (that sentence still doesn't sound right) and a 2-1 home win over West Ham that began vibrantly and ended with nerves shredded. Tyler Blackett has been drafted in, already a more senior head available at the back. 'Obviously, I want to play in every game and I am trying to impress the manager enough to keep my place in his team,' he told ManUtd.com. 'At first, I would have been happy just to gain experience by being in and around the squad. 'But now that I have played a few games, it is one of those situations when you are hungry for more. There is healthy competition among the defenders.' Angel di Maria has made a flying start to life at Old Trafford under Van Gaal . Marcos Rojo is a new signing but must already try to organise a new back line, including Tyler Blackett . Healthy competition, yes - but the inconsistency remains. It's this contrast between performances that Van Gaal has not yet managed to reconcile. United can look a completely different team within the space one match, never mind one week, and the reasons for this go deeper than an injury crisis that will once more find Van Gaal scrabbling around for fit defenders at Carrington today. For all the technical quality of United's offensive players – Herrera in particular looks a fine footballer – United continue to have difficulties retaining possession for long periods. Ferguson used to talk about suffocating opponents with possession but that trait began to slip away during his later years and it's problem that went on to afflict Moyes' United and is now causing difficulties for Van Gaal. Faclao and Robin van Perise will hope to build on their striking partnership against Everton . Ander Herrera looks like a fine footballer, but he will miss out this weekend due to a rib injury . Against West Ham, for example, United were already beginning to pedal backwards prior to Rooney's sending off after an hour. A team that can look as devastating as any when it moves forward still spends too much time without the ball, despite the endless passing drills that Van Gaal asks his coaches to organise on a daily basis during first ream training. Perhaps United's venerable coach will not be able to fix this until another transfer window or two has passed. Maybe the return of Michael Carrick will help. Whatever the case, with Everton's visit on Sunday followed by games against West Brom, Chelsea and Manchester City, it would appear that United's Barclays Premier League season is about to begin in earnest.

With United not playing in Europe this season, the club are keen to make up some of the lost revenue by arranging an exhibition game overseas, more than likely in the Middle East.

"On a relatively bad night for Manchester City in the Champions League against AS Roma on Tuesday, it didn’t take long for old rivals to get busy. Speaking on TV, former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes accused City supporters of failing to create the ‘special atmosphere’ he remembers from European nights at Old Trafford, while his former team-mate Rio Ferdinand tweeted provocatively about empty seats while watching the game at home. ‘Expanding the stadium for what, for who?’ Ferdinand asked pithily. Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure look despondent after seeing their European hopes suffer a blow . Large sections of the Etihad stadium appeared empty during the Champions League clash on Tuesday . Some Manchester City decide to leave the stadium early after Roma's equaliser . Paul Scholes was not impressed with the atmosphere after watching the game from the ITV studio . Tuesday’s game — a 1-1 draw — was a big one for City, given that they had lost their opening fixture in Munich. It was odd to see a smattering of empty seats at the Etihad Stadium, just as it is odd that the club’s Champions League attendances are moving gently in the wrong direction. Nevertheless, perhaps Scholes and Ferdinand have short memories. Both enjoyed their share of big nights in the Champions League at Old Trafford but there were numerous European occasions over the past decade when United sold cut-price tickets to schools at the last minute in a bid to fill the ground. There were others, too, when the Old Trafford atmosphere was as flat as the M1. Scholes in particular will remember United captain Roy Keane’s famous rant after a 1-0 win over Dynamo Kiev took Sir Alex Ferguson’s team through the group stages back in 2000. ‘At home the fans have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches and they don’t realise what’s going on out on the pitch,’ said Keane. ‘I don’t think some of the people who come to Old Trafford can spell football, never mind understand it.’ Sergio Aguero wheels away after opening the scoring for Manchester City from the penalty spot . Francesco Totti nets the equaliser to become the Champions League's oldest goal scorer aged 38 . Roma fans struggle to contain their excitement after their hero Totti equalises . Manchester United . Kispest Honved (Sep 1993) 35,781 (capacity 44,000) IFK Goteborg (Sep 1994) 33,625 (capacity 44,000) Debrecen (Aug 2005) 51,701 (capacity 68,000) Manchester City . CSKA Moscow (Nov 2013) 35,000 . Roma (Sept 2014) 37,509 . Viktoria Plzen (Nov 2013) 37,742 . Bob Treasure . So famous are those quotes that they have their own Wikipedia page. Equally interesting is that Keane’s comments came only a few months after his manager had asked United’s supporters for more noise. United fans will argue that they had already scaled the heights in the Champions League back then; that it was hard to get up for run-of-the-mill group games so soon after the drama of their 1999 Final win. City do not have that excuse. This is only their fourth season in the competition and they are yet to progress beyond the last 16. Had you offered many of their rank-and-file the chance to watch games like Tuesday night's 10 years ago, they would have swum the length of the Ship Canal to get there. In a city like Manchester, however, there are always financial issues to consider. Andy Savage, who runs the website MCFCForum.com, said: ‘Ferdinand is living in his own bubble. Some people are living hand to mouth and he’s criticising them for not filling the stadium. Paul Scholes and Rio Ferdinand (L) criticised City for not creating a special atmosphere like Old Trafford . Roy Keane coined the phrase ' prawn sandwich brigade' after this game against Dynamo Kiev in 2000 . Stands were not always packed during Champions League nights at Old Trafford . 'Away from home our fans are fantastic, I'd call them the hardcore fans. But at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch. 'I don't think some of the people who come to Old Trafford can spell football, never mind understand it.' ‘He was an absolute disgrace on Twitter, as was Scholes on ITV. They are multi-millionaires.’ City’s owners have only targeted the last eight this time and don’t expect Manuel Pellegrini to win the competition just yet. One view is that City fans prefer to watch Barclays Premier League football as it is a competition they feel they can win. Whatever the case, the club themselves remain sanguine about attendance levels and point out that they don’t make the purchase of Champions League tickets compulsory for those with season tickets, as United and Arsenal do. Manchester United can fall back on memories of winning the competition in 1999 (above) and 2008 . Manchester City fans do not necessarily expect Manuel Pellegrini to win the Champions League this year . A small collection of Manchester City fans hold up letters to spell the Chilean manager's name . They know their fan base is considerably smaller than United’s but the Etihad sells out for every game in the League and research tells them that enough games are over-subscribed to make a 6,000-seat stadium expansion — already under way — worthwhile. At times, when the Etihad is less than full, it can seem a rather over-ambitious project. However, City do have a waiting list of 7,500 for season tickets and deposits have already been paid on every one of the new seats for next season. As ever, City remain sure of themselves and their visions. All they need to do now is put right some of the problems that continue to affect them on the field on European nights. Outplayed in losing 1-0 in Munich, City spent much of Tuesday’s game on the back foot once more and, despite captain Vincent Kompany’s attempts to claim otherwise, Pellegrini has a real issue with the poor form of Yaya Toure in the centre of his midfield. There are plans to increase the capacity of the Etihad stadium to 55,000 with an extra 6,000 seats . Unlike Louis van Gaal's side, at least Manchester City are in the Champions League this season . Once again on Tuesday it was the failure of Toure and his central partner Fernandinho to assume control that allowed Roma to move forward on to Pellegrini’s back four. ‘He’s done so much for this club, he’s always played brilliantly,’ said Kompany of Toure. ‘For me he is always an important player,. When he does well the team does well. He has set the standards very high for himself. To say he’s not at his best, I don’t agree. It’s so early in the season to call something like this, things will improve.’ Kompany’s loyalty is admirable but it’s undeniable that City improved on Tuesday once Frank Lampard replaced Eden Dzeko, allowing Toure to push up behind forward Sergio Aguero. It surely can’t be long before Pellegrini does this routinely in Europe. For the time being, City’s critics will perhaps revel in their perceived struggles, both on and off the field in Europe. City do, however, have one rather obvious card to play when their neighbours start to dig at them about Champions League matters. At least they are in the competition.","Manchester City were held to a 1-1 draw with Roma in Champions League .

"Sir Alex Ferguson didn't get an awful lot wrong during his time at Manchester United but, three-and-half years after he said it, his assertion that Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling would be Old Trafford's central defensive pairing of the future remains distinctly unproven. 'That is how I look upon it,' said Ferguson in an interview with the official Inside United magazine in February 2011. 'I think their time will come.' Had things gone as planned, this indeed would be the era of Evans and Smalling. Both have been at the club for long enough now. This season, for the first time, the path to the first team has been left clear by the departures of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. Chris Smalling has failed to cement a place in the heart of Manchester United's defence . Jonny Evans had to be replaced during the first-half against Leicester with an injury . Sir Alex Ferguson (centre right) predicted Smalling (far right) and Evans would be the club's defensive pairing . Still United wait, though. As both careers continues to be hampered by injury, Evans and Smalling remain some way short of a pairing that can move United forwards to where they need to be in the coming weeks, months and years. Recent problems for Louis van Gaal in his first season at United have only highlighted the issue. Four goals were conceded at Milton Keynes Dons in the Capital One Cup while an astonishing five were shipped at Leicester in the Barclays Premier League at the weekend. Now, with Evans injured and young prospect Tyler Blackett suspended after a red card on Sunday, Van Gaal is having to countenance the prospect of using central midfielder Michael Carrick as a defender when he returns from the ankle injury that has ruined his summer and early season. Certainly, it is difficult to see who United's central defensive pairing will be this time next year, never mind in five years' time. This, as much as anything, illustrates how the natural evolution that top clubs like to oversee in all areas of a playing squad has stalled in defensive areas at Old Trafford in recent years. Evans' latest injury has added to Louis van Gaal's central defensive crisis at the club . Smalling reacts as United capitulate in their 5-3 Premier League defeat at Leicester on Sunday . Midfielder Michael Carrick could be deployed at centre back for United when he returns from injury . Carrick has missed the beginning of the campaign after undergoing ankle surgery during pre-season . England intetnational Phil Jones (left) has failed to make a consistent impact at Old Trafford . Highest number of consecutive league matches played by Evans, Smalling and Jones in last two seasons... Evans - Seven . Smalling - 12 . Jones - 11 . Ferguson also signed England man Phil Jones from Blackburn three summers ago. That was part of the grand plan, too. But Jones, shunted about too often from midfield to defence, has similarly struggled to consistently make an impact. Neither of the three players will like to hear it, no player does, but Jones, Evans and Smalling are all too injury prone. That, in some way, is why it has proved so difficult to judge them. Certainly in the case of Smalling and Jones it is difficult to judge or predict how effective a United player they will be simply because we haven't seen enough of them. When you consider the fact that Evans (7), Jones (11) and Smalling (12) have managed to pay so few consecutive league games over the course of the last two seasons then the issue with fitness becomes clear. There is not a young footballer in the world who will improve if his body doesn't allow him to play. On Sunday at Leicester, for example, United arrived in the East Midlands with Evans fit, Jones injured and Smalling on the bench after a month out with a groin problem. By full-time, Evans was in a cast with a foot injury and Smalling had come on to replace him. Blackett, meanwhile, had been sent off. And so it goes on. Tyler Blackett (right) was sent off for United during their humbling at the King Power Stadium . Evans (centre) has only managed to play seven games in a row for United in the last two years . Interestingly, United's medical staff began this season convinced that their defenders would enjoy relatively injury-free campaigns. With players like the three we have mentioned reaching physical maturity, it was anticipated inside the club that they would be available more often. How you can make those assessments is hard to understand but, whatever the science behind it, the opposite is proving true so far. Smalling and Jones are only 24 and 22, of course. They should still have their best years ahead of them. Evans, meanwhile, is 26 and has shown enough, when fit, to suggest that he has the potential at least to be a United player of some stature. As time moves on, though, so must the careers of these three players. As Van Gaal has shown so far during his time at the club, if he feels players aren't going to be of sufficient use to him, he will just go and buy somebody else.

"Manuel Pellegrini has revealed the interests of Manchester City will come first when a decision is made about Frank Lampard's future. City's sister club New York City FC want Lampard to join them as planned in January for the new MLS season, no matter how well he plays while on loan in the Barclays Premier League club in the meantime. But City boss Pellegrini today underlined that the decision that is made will be motivated by his team's needs. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini: I'll decide the future of Frank Lampard . Frank Lampard is currently on loan at Manchester City from American franchise New York City FC . Pellegrini described Lampard, who scored twice against Sheffield Wednesday, as a very important City player . The midfielder's parent side New York City FC have insisted his loan stay at the Etihad will finish in the New Year but Pellegrini says the Manchester club will do what is in their best interests when that time comes . He said: 'I can clarify the situation. Lampard is playing and scored two goals in the last game. In this moment he's a very important player for us. 'He will stay with us here on loan is until January and we will see what happens in the future and it's not a problem we have to analyse in this moment. 'We will see after when the loan has finished what we are going to do. 'The possibility is to do the best for Manchester City. 'Frank is a very important player for England and the Premier League. All of you want to continue to see Frank Lampard here.' The Argentine brushed off the criticism of Arsene Wenger, who suggested Lampard's short-term deal with City was questionable on moral grounds. 'I don't analyse what other managers say,' said the City boss. Sergio Aguero, left, and David Silva, right, could feature in Saturday's fixture against Hull at the KC Stadium . Pellegrini confirmed Sergio Aguero and David Silva could feature against Hull on Saturday, but Fernando and Stevan Jovetic will miss the game through injury. 'We continue with Jovetic and Fernando out of the team,' said the 61-year-old. 'They will be ready next week and Samir Nasri also has a groin problem. 'Sergio [Aguero] and David [Silva] are both okay.' The Argentine boss was happy with the manner of City's 7-0 drubbing of Sheffield Wednesday on Wednesday . On their comprehensive 7-0 win against Sheffield Wednesday in the Capital One Cup, he said: 'I think it was very useful match for our team. We weren't scoring too many goals at home. 'In the last four we didn't win, we are not playing bad but we didn't win. Important to win the way we did on Wednesday and we hope that can continue at Hull because in the PL we can't drop many points. 'I don't know the reason [why more goals are being conceded by clubs in the Premier League]. The same statistic about our team is not so good because we scored more in the first five games last season. 'We didn't score against our rivals like Chelsea last year, and we did score this year, and similar against Stoke and Newcastle. In the whole of the Premier League I really don't know.' Spanish starlet Jose Pozo scored in City's emphatic 7-0 Capital One Cup win against Sheffield Wednesday . Young midfielder Jose Pozo, who was on the scoresheet midweek, is one of a crop of youngsters that Pellegrini has high hopes for this campaign. 'It's important when you have the opportunity to give a chance to the young player to see that you're not wrong,' said Pellegrini. 'Pozo is a very good player. 'Now he's coming back after a year out with his ankle. I'm happy to give him the opportunity and I'm happy because I see him work every day.' New Hull signing Abel Hernandez celebrates scoring during their 2-2 draw with West Ham on September 15 . On this weekend's opponents, he said: 'I think that Hull is a difficult team playing away. Last year was maybe not our best game because Vincent Kompany was sent off in the first 10 minutes. 'We played really well and we won. I hope that his year we can do it in the same way but we will find it very tough at their home because they always play very strong.' Pellegrini said he sees James Milner as a valuable squad member at the Etihad, despite the England international struggling for playing time this season. 'I think that what James Milner said is what every player would say,' he explained. 'They all want to play more games. James is an important player for our squad, he knows what I think about that. He's always involved, some starting from the beginning or as a substitute but he's always playing.' Pellegrini insists Milner, right, remains an important member of his City squad despite limited playing time . 'I don't agree that money is the important thing,' said Pellegrini, when addressing the balance of power in the Premier League. 'Every team that wants to have chances to win the Premier League must spend money on good players. We didn't spend more money than Chelsea, United or Arsenal in the last 10 years. Every team has important players and has spent money but you don't win just with money.' On the number of changes he made against City, which saw Joe Hart and Vincent Kompany drop out of the starting line-up, he replied: 'We had a squad and the whole squad will try to be a competitive team in the four competiions. That's why we tried to make some rotations but not with some special names. Kompany was rested.' Pellegrini refused to confirm who would start in goal after Willy Caballero played against Sheffield Wednesday. 'We will see tomorrow who is starting,' he replied.

"Manchester United will again be without new defender Marcos Rojo on Saturday after a delay in the Argentinian getting a work permit. By contrast, new £60m signing Angel di Maria is set to make his debut against Burnley  after Louis van Gaal revealed: 'I think he is ready to play.' A discrepancy with Rojo's passport means he has has to visit the Argentine embassy in Madrid before he gets clearance to play. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Marcos Rojo shooting from range for former club Sporting . Frustration: Louis van Gaal admits that Manchester United are struggling to get a work permit for Marcos Rojo . Magnificent seven: Angel di Maria will make his Manchester United debut at Burnley after his £60m move . This in turn means United will have to visit Burnley without the £16million new signing, even though he signed for the club more than a week ago. On Friday afternoon manager Louis van Gaal said: 'It's only a matter of time. I'm manager of the biggest club in the world, but I can't change the law in Argentina! 'We have to obey the law.' Despite the fact United only have one point from two games and have crashed out of the Capital One Cup to MK Dons, Van Gaal thinks he will be successful at his new club. 'I never doubt myself,' he said. 'I'm sure I will have success here. 'But I need time. We are building up a new team.'

Burnley's form this season is just as bad as United's, following Premier League defeats by Chelsea and Swansea plus a cup exit against Sheffield Wednesday in midweek. But the Dutchman does not expect an easy ride against the Clarets, who were promoted from the Championship last season. Burnley pulled off a huge shock the last time they hosted United in the Premier League, beating Sir Alex Ferguson's United 1-0 in a dramatic Lancashire derby in 2009. 'It will be a fantastic atmosphere,' said Van Gaal. 'They'll play with a lot of passion and long balls. We have to fight against that. 'It shall be a very difficult game but we have to show we can play football.' Van Gaal also backed Wayne Rooney to be a success as England captain following his appointment by Roy Hogson this week as successor to Steven Gerrard. Rooney was also handed the armband by Van Gaal after his appointment in the summer. 'He'll cope with the responsibility,' said Van Gaal. 'I wouldn't have made him Manchester United captain otherwise.'","Manchester United visit Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday .

"For Manchester United, the international break has arrived just in time. Some time and space are required to patch up a few bodies and take a breath after what has been a fraught and testing summer transfer window. When Louis van Gaal’s players return to Carrington for the resumption of the Barclays Premier League in less than two weeks, however, they will face just the same challenges as an evolving squad tries to tackle confidence problems and a new system. United manager Van Gaal appeared to indicate after this scoreless and largely thrill-less draw at Burnley on Saturday that there is no going back from the 3-4-1-2 formation he is trying to drill into his players. VIDEO Scoll down for Louis van Gaal on another poor Manchester United result . Tactics: Louis van Gaal has shown little sign he will deviate from the 3-4-1-2 system he used at the World Cup . As a result, then, United’s destiny would appear to lie more than ever in the hands and hearts of its players. Vice-captain Darren Fletcher underlined that fact when he insisted there was no point hiding behind the difficulties and uncertainty that come with fundamental change. ‘We aren’t doing that at all,’ insisted Fletcher, who has started every league game under Van Gaal this season. ‘We have to master the system and we have to play better and win individual battles. ‘There are other things that come into it apart from the system. I am confident that we will put things right if we keep believing in ourselves and the manager. ‘This is another disappointing result so when we come back from our internationals we are going to have to work on things. Everything is new but basic football principles come into it, too. We are trying our best. We just need to keep believing in the manager’s philosophies and ideas.’ Vice-captain: Darren Fletcher said that all of United's players are working hard at adjusting to the new system . Struggle: Juan Mata has struggled to impose himself on games under Louis van Gaal . With United agreeing £14.25m rising to £15.8m for Daley Blind, Louis van Gaal’s net spend on transfer fees is £149m — just £74m less than Sir Alex Ferguson paid out in his 21 Premier League seasons. The Premier League’s Top 10 net spenders . Mark Hughes - £224.6m (Man City only) Sir Alex Ferguson - £222.7m . (Man Utd, Premier League only) Roberto Mancini - £183.8m (Man City) Jose Mourinho -  £174m (Chelsea) Claudio Ranieri - £167.13m (Chelsea) Louis van Gaal - £149.1m (Man Utd) Manuel Pellegrini - £120.71m (Man City) Brendan Rodgers - £120m.13m . (Liverpool) Carlo Ancelotti -  £113.63m (Chelsea) Rafa Benitez - £105.94m (Liverpool) United were slightly better at Turf Moor than they had been in losing to Swansea and drawing at Sunderland in previous Barclays Premier League matches. New signing Angel di Maria enjoyed an impressive debut and United enjoyed enough possession. Still, though, there were signs of the disconnect between the manager’s theory and his players’ execution. At times the simple things continued to look rather difficult. ‘It’s mentally challenging but that’s always been the case here,’ added Fletcher. ‘It’s mentally challenging playing for a club of this size. The players are well used to that. ‘As players learning a new system and developing new ideas you know it’s going to make you a better player in the long term, without a doubt. ‘It’s training, videos, constant learning, looking over every match. We are putting a lot of effort into it and there has been improvement, but there is going to have to be a lot more if we are going to get where we want to be. ‘We have to look to ourselves. We expect the other top teams to win but we have to start winning, too. It’s a long season but we need to get going.’ After Saturday’s game in blustery Lancashire, Van Gaal himself looked a little like a man who wanted to get away and reflect on what he has learned during his first weeks of competitive action in England. For now, the Dutchman’s message continues to be the same: namely that over time, improvement will come. ‘I think you can only judge after one season and not in weeks or months or something like that,’ said the United manager. Transfer: Manchester United spent a record £60million on signing Angel di Maria from Real Madrid . ‘I think we have to rebuild a new team and what I have already said is that this needs time. ‘At the moment I have to repeat myself every week when we are losing points. You are tired of my answer but also the fans shall be tired of them soon and that’s not a good way to discuss that subject.’ With Dutch utility player Daley Blind the latest significant signing of United’s summer, Van Gaal can certainly not claim to have had anything other than appropriate financial backing from the club. By the time QPR visit Old Trafford on September 14, competition for places should be relatively lively. It will be interesting to see how many times Van Gaal is brave enough to play Di Maria, Juan Mata, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie in the same team. On Saturday’s evidence, Mata looks the most vulnerable to change but Rooney, too, must find some of his real form. His partnership with Van Persie is now in its third season but still appears to need work. Van Gaal said: ‘You have seen what Rooney was doing, eh? He’s running everywhere in the game. ‘It’s always difficult when you don’t score as a striker to say, “Ok, he played fantastic”. It’s always difficult to say that. But he gives an example in hard work for the team.’ SUPER STAT: Burnley have kept only four clean sheets in 41 Premier League matches...but two have come against Manchester United.

"Roy Hodgson claimed Wayne Rooney can handle the pressure as he closes in on becoming England’s all-time leading goalscorer. Rooney scored from the penalty spot during England’s 5-0 destruction of European minnows San Marino in their Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley, but missed several chances to add to his total of 42 goals. Sir Bobby Charlton’s record of 49, plus Gary Lineker’s haul of 48 and Jimmy Greaves (44) are within sight for the Manchester United striker. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney say he tries not to think about the record . England ran out comfortable 5-0 winners against San Marino in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Thursday night . Rooney has now scored 42 goals for England, two less than Jimmy Greaves and seven off the record . Hodgson said: ‘The record won't play on his mind. We'd like to think, with the way he is and the footballer he is, he's got a good few years in him yet. ‘There are plenty of games left. I don't think we should put any pressure on him to reach targets early. ‘The important thing is he keeps playing well and doing a job for the team and working as hard as he did tonight. ‘He got in a lot of times. His runs were very good. He's a bit disappointed with the chip. He thought that was on. Joe Hart was effectively a spectator against San Marino, but fans voted him man of the match anyway . Jack Wilshere was the eventual recipient of the award, despite only getting 11 per cent of the vote . ‘I'm more than happy with him. It was another good captain's performance, solid throughout.’ Although San Marino scored a clear own goal from Rooney’s deflected effort Hodgson joked that the England forward should have been given the goal. He said: ‘I’d always back Rooney, but I guess we will have to wait for the UEFA verdict.’ Phil Jagielka opened the scoring for England in the 24th minute and Rooney scored from the spot before the break. Danny Welbeck scored after half-time, Andros Townsend added another and an own goal gave England victory in front of just over 60,000 supporters at Wembley. England fans made their views known on the quality of opposition when they voted Joe Hart, who didn’t have one save to make, the Vauxhall man of the match. Wilshere was joined by club team-mate Danny Welbeck who scored his country's third on Thursday night . Roy Hodgson said he was pleased with the result against San Marino, who, he claimed, had improved . Hodgson added: ‘I wouldn't disagree with Jack's award (as the official man of the match). ‘His passing was outstanding in the second half and he didn't do too badly in the first half either. It was nice to see Adam Lallana again, those wonderful touches. ‘We didn't always convert them, but we must have had seven or eight intricate moves in the penalty box but couldn't put them away. ‘I was pleased we won, pleased we got the job done, very pleased with the crowd who were terrific throughout: their mood, their buoyancy and determination to get some enjoyment from the game. ‘That was a cause of satisfaction. We kept plugging away in the first half when it was difficult to break them down. Raheem Sterling continued his international education against sub-standard opposition . Like his Liverpool team-mate Sterling, Jordan Henderson was substituted at half time . ‘Our tempo was up in the second half, because it was hard for them to keep going in that second half. ‘It's an important job done and we can concentrate our efforts on the second game, in Estonia. ‘We should stop being surprised in international football. If you happen to be called Spain, Russia or England, we can't expect we can go and beat whoever because we have more people than them. ‘San Marino were better this year, though as an amateur team it'll be a while before they win somewhere like Wembley, I hope.’ Hodgson took off two Liverpool players at half-time - Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson - but insists it had nothing to do with his public spat with Brendan Rodgers. The England head coach added: ‘With the wealth of talent we have in attacking areas, it was nice today to take people like Sterling, Henderson and Welbeck off who might play an important role for us on Sunday.’","England beat San Marino 5-0 at Wembley .

"Brendan Rodgers has rubbished claims that he has fallen out with Roy Hodgson after the England manager revealed Liverpool midfielder Raheem Sterling had complained of tiredness while on international duty. Rodgers was unhappy with widespread criticism directed towards the 19-year-old in the wake of Hodgson's comments following England's Euro 2016 qualifying win against Estonia. The Three Lions boss opted to bring Sterling off the bench in Tallinn before admitting that he had spoken to him about his form and fitness.

'If you look at it from Roy's perspective he obviously wanted to give Adam Lallana a chance and felt he could use the squad.

"Burnley held Manchester United to a 0-0 draw at Turf Moor on Saturday as Louis van Gaal awaits his first win in charge at Old Trafford. Find out how the players fared in the Barclays Premier League contest. BURNLEY . TOM HEATON - 7 . A big day for the former United keeper and he will remember it. Good handling a super first half stop from Van Persie. KIERAN TRIPPIER - 6.5 . Didn’t get forward as much as may have hoped but never looked out of place against United’s attacking stars. JASON SHACKELL - 8 . A terrific performance from the Burnley captain. Led by example. Authoritative all afternoon. Triple team: Burnley trio Jason Shackell, Kieran Trippier and Dean Marney challenge Juan Mata . MICHAEL DUFF - 7 . Central defensive partnerships are very important and Duff played his part in this one. BEN MEE - 6 . Didn’t always look comfortable in possession and was happy to take the easy option. Solid enough, though. SCOTT ARFIELD - 6 . Couldn’t repeat his spectacular effort against Chelsea but showed the other side of his game here. Never stopped running. Race:  Scott Arfield chases down Manchester United midfielder Ashley Young . DAVID JONES - 7 . Struck a terrific early free-kick against the bar and looked persistently dangerous. DEAN MARNEY - 6.5 . Had a better afternoon as the game continued and worked hard to stifle some of United’s midfield players . MATTHEW TAYLOR - 6 . His experience will be important this season but didn’t have his best afternoon. DANNY INGS - 5.5 . Came out of the Championship with a big reputation but hasn’t lived up to it yet. Looked one-paced here. Struggle: Danny Ings once again failed to make an impact for Burnley and was hardly given a sniff . LUKAS JUTKIEWICZ - 6 . The better of Burnley’s two forwards, he may have done more with an early chance than shoot against De Gea’s legs. Subs: Barnes 6.5, Reid 6 . MANCHESTER UNITED . DAVID DE GEA - 7.5 . Always looks solid these days and once again did what he had to do without fuss. PHIL JONES - 6 . Did little wrong but needs to be more commanding and realise that he becoming a senior player. Up in the air: Phil Jones put in a solid performance at the back as Manchester United kept a clean sheet . JONNY EVANS - 6 . United always look better when he is in the team and showed signs he is growing in to the season . TYLER BLACKETT - 5.5 . It’s been a hard baptism for the young defender this season. Looks short of confidence when in possession. Development: Youngster Tyler Blackett started in defence once again for Manchester United . ANTONIO VALENCIA - 5.5 . No reason why he can’t be an efficient wing-back but needs to concentrate better. Gave the ball away in dangerous positions. DARREN FLETCHER - 6 . Looks a real athlete again and did his job simply and efficiently here. Good to see him back at this level. JUAN MATA - 5.5 . He could be the long-term casualty of Di Maria’s arrival if he doesn’t raise his game. Fell over a good chance.

"Roy Hodgson claimed Liverpool's poor start to the season was behind Raheem Sterling's decision to pull out of England's starting line-up against Estonia. Sterling was dropped to the bench and replaced by Adam Lallana in England's 1-0 victory over Estonia after admitting he wasn't mentally ready to start the Euro 2016 qualifier. The Liverpool forward, still only 19, came off the bench to win the 74th minute free-kick that led to England skipper Wayne Rooney scoring his 43rd goal for his country. Liverpool's Raheem Sterling was a second-half substitute in Estonia after admitting he wasn't mentally ready . Here are facts for Raheem Sterling's season so far with club side Liverpool... Games Played: 10 . Minutes Played: 854 . Goals: 3 . Total shots: 17 . Shots on target: 12 . Shooting accuracy: 71% . Shot conversion rate: 18% . Mins per goal: 285 . Assists: 2 . Chances Created (inc. assists): 20 . Passes: 382 . Passing Accuracy: 79% . Dribble Completion: 48% . Hodgson said: 'There is an awful lot going on in his head. Perhaps it's quite simply the season hasn't started quite as well for Liverpool as they wanted. 'He's player who's always in the focus and spotlight for England and Liverpool, maybe that's had some effect. But I don't know, it's a theory. 'In mitigation of a young player, when you break into a team like Liverpool and you have a fantastic season, then you go to the World Cup and you do well and people regard you as one of the few who lived up to his reputation. 'Then you come back and you're still only 19 years of age, there are a lot of other things that play a part it people's make up. It isn't quite as simple as the training you're doing maybe taking some juice from your legs.' Hodgson claimed Sterling is one of the biggest talents in English football after the World Cup, but the decision to withdraw him from the team to start in Tallinn is highly unusual. The England substitutes watch on in Estonia as Sterling (second right) was rested from the starting line-up .

Wayne Rooney 758 mins . Fabian Delph 741 mins . Adam Lallana 538 mins . Sterling played just 45 minutes of England's 5-0 victory over San Marino at Wembley on Thursday night and Hodgson claimed at the time that he looked to the head coach in the dressing room to say 'why me?'. Less than 48 hours later Hodgson revealed that Sterling approached him after a warm up at London Colney on Saturday morning to tell him that he was not in the right mental state to play. Hodgson said: 'People don't like it when you simplistically tell the truth. We were training at The Grove doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically. 'Just before we started, Raheem had done the warm up and he came to me and said ''look I really am feeling a bit tired, I'm not in my best form at the moment because I am feeling a bit tired''. 'So I said best thing is Adam Lallana starts the game and you rest and I have got you to bring on from the bench, simple as that. Sterling's Liverpool team-mate Adam Lallana started in his place and put in a solid performance in Tallinn . 'As you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he isn't suffering from anything. 'It was a question of having two players, who both did pretty well against San Marino and one is telling me he is a bit tired and jaded, the other one is full of beans. 'We'll put the one on who is full of beans and keep the other one up your sleeve. 'I think it would be wrong of players to try to fool me into think they are ready and that they're 100 per cent when they aren't because they are robbing somebody else of an opportunity. I thought Lallana had a good game.' Sterling told Hodgson he was feeling tired and not in the right mental state during training on Saturday . Sterling came on and made an impression, but the expectation of the youngster is high . After the San Marino game, Hodgson claimed that the Liverpool forward had been at his best on the night and that there was no cause for concern. That had changed by the time he explained the decision to leave Sterling on the bench until the 63rd minute, when he came on to replace Jordan Henderson. Hodgson added: 'Don't forget it was two days after quite a difficult game against San Marino. It was two days after the game. 'It was fatigue he hadn't managed to shake off after the San Marino game, it was no more complicated than that. Is it common? I don't really know. Raheem Sterling, warming up during the first-half in Estonia, complained of feeling tired in training . Sterling raises expectations when he gets the ball and perks up the support, despite starting on the bench . 'At international level, when there are so many good players trying to get their hands on the shirt, I don't think you should keep hold of it when maybe you are feeling yourself that you're not at your best. 'We have to take players' welfare into consideration and there are times when top league teams with Champions League football when players suffer from a physical and mental fatigue.' Hodgson has a good working relationship with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, but these claims will create tension when Sterling returns to Melwood on Monday. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (right) might have a different view to Hodgson on Sterling's fitness . Joal Lindpere (left) attempts to catch up with Sterling in the second-half in Tallinn . Sterling is one of Liverpool's best players and it will be down to Rodgers to make sure the forward is in the right frame of mind to face his former side QPR on Sunday. Hodgson added: 'I don't want to say any more, I don't want to get drawn. If you really want to research that further you've got to speak to him, people who work with him and his club. It was a simple decision. 'It was good to have him up our sleeve to put on in the last 25 mins and I'm convinced he'll have a week now, exactly a week, I'm pretty sure when he goes back to Liverpool they'll sort him out and come Sunday you'll see him flying around.'","Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling started Estonia match on the bench .

"Jose Mourinho admits he is powerless to prevent Spain selecting Diego Costa in their squad for next month's Euro 2016 qualifiers as the problems over his injury mount up. The Chelsea manager is picking and choosing the forward's matches carefully after he returned from the last international break with a hamstring injury.

Mourinho said: 'I'm nobody to make that decision. Everything is clear. Everybody knows what is going on with Diego. Everyone knows he's in trouble for quite a long time. But I'm nobody. 'The moment a national team wants to select a Chelsea player, I'm nobody. It's their decision. They can call the players, play them, do what they want. It's completely out of my control. What I think and what I feel doesn't play a part. 'The medical departments do what they want. It's not our decision. We can communicate, send exams and reports, but it's their decision. 'After the game against Arsenal, or even before that when they make the pre-selection, everything is in their hands. I can do nothing.'

Costa missed the midweek Capital One Cup tie against Bolton but will return to the starting line-up for tomorrow's clash with Aston Villa in the Barclays Premier League. His hamstring injury is so sensitive that he may be rested or on the substitutes' bench for the Champions League trip with Sporting on Tuesday. Mourinho added: 'He plays tomorrow and starts the game without problems. The question is always the same: ""Can he finish the game and be in conditions to play in Lisbon 48 hours later?"" That I don't know. 'But, at this moment, because I don't think about Sporting or the Champions League, I think about Villa in the PL and he plays for sure. He's in good position to start. Costa (centre) could be named as a substitute for Chelsea's Champions League trip to Sporting Lisbon . 'If he doesn't play against Sporting, I play Drogba or Remy. But this game is tomorrow, not Tuesday. It's another game, another story. I don't think about the Sporting game. 'I play tomorrow with the team I think is the best to win against Villa. After that, the consequences I will face. I have to organise a team to play against Sporting. Tomorrow I play with the team I think is the best to win. 'Everyone is working hard. He is the first to do that. He's working hard in his recovery, with the medical staff and the conditioning staff, trying to be ready for every game. 'Mentally, he's ready for every game.

"New Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo is facing an anxious wait in Madrid to see if he will be granted a visa to live in the UK, it emerged on Saturday. The Argentina international was signed by United 12 days ago and introduced as a new player at a press conference last Friday. However, the £16m signing from Sporting Lisbon has still not played for his new club. VIDEO Scroll down for Marcos Rojo: Manchester United transfer was long and tough . New signing: Marcos Rojo has completed his £16million move to United but is still not allowed to play . Relaxed: Manchester United are confident that the player will be given a visa and will return from Madrid . There has been speculation that Rojo has run in to problems over third party ownership – he was part owned by an agency when playing in Portugal – or that he hadn't played enough competitive games for his country to qualify for a work permit. However it is understood that the actual issue is that Rojo is waiting to see if he will be given a UK visa as embassy officials look in to the details of an altercation with a neighbour in Argentina in 2010 that still lies on his file in his home country. The 24-year-old was never prosecuted over the incident but it is still theoretically being investigated after the case was reopened in May of this year. Rojo does not have a criminal record but it is likely that Embassy officials are checking the exact details of the situation before processing the visa. Needed: Untied will be keen to get Rojo back in England and into the squad as soon as possible . Rojo has had a visa interview at the Embassy and is still in Spain awaiting the outcome. United officials are understood to be relaxed about the issue and see the process as a mere matter of procedure. An Old Trafford source said today: 'Marcos had to leave the country in order to obtain a visa and then use it to officially re-enter the Uk to live.

"For Leeds Rhinos the wait is over and one of rugby league’s great peculiarities is no more. Not since 1999 had this great sporting institution celebrated a Challenge Cup Final victory. Six times they had tried in recent years and six times, remarkably, they had failed. Now, after this compelling and deserved victory over neighbours and underdogs Castleford, Brian McDermott’s team have the sport’s most cherished trophy back in their possession again. Delirious: Leeds Rhinos celebrate their first Challenge Cup trophy success in 15 years . Delighted: Brian McDermott looks over the moon after leading Leeds Rhinos to Challenge Cup success . Celebrations: Kevin Sinfield (left) and McDermott hold aloft the Tetleys Challenge Cup trophy . Big occasion: Castleford and Leeds met at Wembley for the 113th final of its type . Early lead: Tom Briscoe scores the first try of the game at Wembley . Few could argue with the result either. Leeds began well, scored an early try through winger Tom Briscoe and never really looked back. Castleford, the surprise entity of the rugby league season, railed briefly at the start of the second half and the game was alive when Oliver Holmes powered over to bring the score back to 16-10. But this was a day when Leeds always looked destined to win and it was fitting that one of the games true titans, winger Ryan Hall, scored his second try late in the game to earn himself the Lance Todd Man of the Match trophy and his team the victory. Given the enormity of the occasion and the challenge facing them, it seemed imperative that Castleford started the game well. Unfortunately for Daryl Powell’s team, they couldn’t find their rhythm and it only took Leeds a matter of minutes to score. The big Castleford prop Craig Huby – playing just two weeks after dislocating his elbow – tried to lay down something of a marker with an early hit on Kevin Sinfield but Leeds began with purpose and zest and it wasn’t a surprise when pressure build down the left allowed the favourites to move the ball across the field where centre Kallum Watkins supplied Briscoe with an invitation to dive over in the right corner. Crucial: Danny McGuire scores his side's second try of the game against Castleford . Clinical: McGuire scores his side's second try of the afternoon in the Wembley showdown against Castleford . Sinfield kicked with customary precision and calm from the touchline and Leeds were away. For a while, Castleford did show something of their true selves. Winger Justin Carney was unfortunate not to score when he went over only for referee Phil Bentham to pull play back. A minute or so later, however, Castleford were over as Daryl Clark ran on to a Marc Sneyd kick to bundle Zak Hardaker out of the way and touch down. Despite Sneyd missing a rather kickable conversion, Castleford were back in the game but it was the period between then and the interval that left them with such a long road back. Leeds, at this point, were just too precise, too reliable. Leeds’ second try was certainly a poor one from a Castleford point of view as full-back Luke Dorn stood transfixed beneath a routine Rob Burrow kick and Danny McGuire leapt above him to score. With Sinfield kicking expertly once again, this time from the left, Leeds had their noses in front and six minutes later they came up with one of the tries of which they are so capable. Seemingly pinned down on his own goal line, Hardaker somehow sprung three tackles to make 50 metres and begin a sequence that ended with Hall forcing his way past Kirk Dixon from a standing start to bundle the ball over. Euphoria: McGuire celebrates his try as he puts his team in the ascendancy before half-time . High hopes: Castleford fans look ahead to the Challenge Cup final at Wembley . It was classic play from Hall, one of Super League’s most remarkable athletes, and, despite Sinfield missing the conversion, it have Leeds a 16-4 half-time lead they never really looked like relinquishing. Castleford did find some rather belated adrenaline to feed off early in the second half and scored their second try on the back of a breakaway that saw Jamie Ellis, Dorn and Michael Shenton combine to send in the second row Holmes. On another day, Powell’s brave team may have used that score as a platform for recovery. Here, though, Leeds were not to be denied and perhaps the decisive try of the afternoon arrived with 13 minutes left. This time it was Leeds interchange Paul Aiton who did the groundwork, scurrying laterally along the ten metre line to feed Hall. Once again the big winger had everything to do as three Castleford men stood between him and the line. Seconds later, though, Liam Finn, Holmes and Weller Hauraki lay on the floor like crumpled white bed sheets as Leeds celebrated the score that means that in the pubs of places like Wigan, St Helens and Bradford they must now find something else to laugh about.","Leeds saw off their Yorkshire rivals Castleford at Wembley on Saturday .

"Mike Ashley will have to fork out £5million to fire Alan Pardew as manager of Newcastle. Ashley, who was at the Britannia to watch their 1-0 defeat against Stoke, agreed to the clause when he handed the manager an eight year contract in September 2012. The Newcastle owner has dramatically cut costs at St James' Park in the past couple of years and is reluctant to get into the expensive business of hiring and firing managers. Mike Ashley will have to pay £5million if he wants to sack under-fire Newcastle boss Alan Pardew . Newcastle owner Ashley denied he was being serious when he said he would sack Pardew if he lost to Stoke . Prior to the game, Ashley said he would sack Pardew if they lost to Stoke but his lawyers then insisted the Newcastle owner had been joking. The boss of Sports Direct came out with the comments while leaning on the wall outside a pub in London’s trendy Soho district. According to The Independent, he said Pardew had: ‘One more game — if we lose against Stoke on Monday night then he’s gone. I have had enough. Ashley: 'If we lose against Stoke on Monday night then he's gone. I have had enough. Dead. Finished. Over' ‘Dead. Finished. Over. One more game then that’s it. What would you do? I have spent a lot of money on that club, it’s cost me a lot. I won’t put up with it any more. Honestly, answer me, what would you do? One more loss and he’s gone, he’s over, finished.’ On Saturday night, Ashley’s lawyers maintained: ‘Mr Ashley responded, tongue in cheek, that Mr Pardew had two more games before being sacked. ‘To put this into perspective, over the past few weeks certain reports have stated that they believe that Mr Pardew has two more games before being sacked. Mr Ashley was therefore humouring the reporter.’ Whatever the reason for his words, it is one more embarrassing affair for the eccentric chairman who bought Newcastle in 2007 at a cost of £55million and has been at odds with the fans almost ever since. Mike Ashley said he may give Alan Pardew the chop if Newcastle United lose to Stoke City on Monday night . He had so far been meeting a fans campaign demanding Pardew’s exit with defiance. The former West Ham boss was odds on with bookmakers to be the next Premier League manager to lose his job, but those odds had changed following a dramatic late comeback to get a draw against Hull last weekend, followed by a Capital Cup win at Crystal Palace. And if Ashley was joking, it will not be seen as very funny by his manager, who is striving to regain some stability at a club who are bottom of the Premier League table. The report says Ashley was leaning against the wall of The Golden Lion pub in Soho’s Dean Street, enjoying a drink with a friend, when the exchange happened. A man with a reputation for flambouyant dealing in the city - this week he bought £43m worth of Tesco shares - he can be colourful when he is out. He was once seen on TV downing a pint of lager in one go at an Arsenal game. Asked about whether he had told Pardew about his decision or lined up a replacement, Ashley is reported to have said: ‘That’s all I’m prepared to say about it and now that I’ve said it, it’s out there. You can do what you want with it. There’s only so much I can take.’ Ashley and Pardew held clear-the-air talks two weeks ago after Newcastle had been thrashed 4-0 at Southampton. The owner sanctioned £25m of spending in the summer, including paying £12m for Remy Cabella from Montpellier, and £6m to Ajax for Siem de Jong. Supporters held posters demanding that Alan Pardew be sacked as Newcastle United manager last week .

"Barclays Premier League clubs will cut the parachute payment time period for relegated clubs from four years to just three under new proposals. Under the current rules the three teams heading for the Championship are paid a total of £62.8million to help with the transition to life outside the top flight. They are currently paid the sums over a four year cycle but Premier League teams intend to reduce the payments to three years from the start of the new television deal in 2016/17. Norwich, who were relegated to the Championship last season, will receive £60m over a four year cycle . Fulham were also relegated from the Premier League along with Welsh outfit Cardiff City . They will provide an incentive to accept the proposals by increasing the parachute payments when the television contracts are renewed at the end of the season.

"For a man obsessed with preparation and time-keeping, Arsene Wenger and his team are developing a habit of leaving it all to the last minute. On Saturday they relied on Aaron Ramsey to rescue them in the final seconds of their opening Barclays Premier League fixture against Crystal Palace at the Emirates. On Monday, after a chaotic mix-up involving the Turkish airport authorities, Arsene Wenger arrived in Istanbul for their Champions League qualifier against Besiktas way behind schedule. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ramsey and Monreal get their ears flicked during training . Optimistic: Arsene Wenger wants his side to put on a better display than they did against Palace . Team talk: Wenger speaks with his players ahead of their Champions league clash against Besiktas . Wenger was still fuming about their performance against Palace, frustrated by their failure to put away the opposition long before Ramsey’s winner. He is demanding an improvement on Tuesday evening. ‘We were not completely happy with our performance last Saturday and we want to improve,’ he said. ‘It is a big test. We have had a short preparation and we know that in one week we have three big games with Besiktas home and away and Everton in between. We have to be on our toes.’ Arsenal were sluggish on Saturday, confronted by unusual circumstances after Tony Pulis decided to leave Palace just 48 hours before the season began. The bright spot was the performance of Calum Chambers and he will make his Champions League bow alongside Laurent Koscielny in hostile surroundings. Wenger believes he is ready. Comeback kings: Arsenal pulled it back to claim all three points against Crystal palace at the weekend . Good performance: Wenger was pleased with the performance of Arsenal new boy Calum Chamers (pictured) ‘He won’t play the full season as he is only 19, but he had adapted very well,’ added Wenger. ‘At the moment he is growing with every game and resisting the pressure. He’s adapting to a new position.’ Here in Istanbul, Arsenal are on familiar territory, accustomed to playing a Champions League qualifier before the action starts for real in the group stages next month. They have made it for the past 16 years. ‘I have good experience of the Champions League,’ added Wenger. ‘I know you have to be pragmatic, but first we have to qualify. Before we can speak about anything else we have to put in two big performances against Besiktas. ‘I let people judge what I do. All I can do is my best every day and accept the verdict. I’m in a public job so I accept it. ‘Financially it is a big game, but it doesn’t affect my transfer policy. We want to compete at the top level and to fight with the best in Europe. That’s the point of the competition.’ Wenger’s eyes always light up when he speaks of the Champions League and last night, inside the Ataturk Olympic Stadium, was no different. He is obsessed with the idea of winning it. ‘Every game we win makes us stronger and that will give us confidence,’ added Wenger. To live with Besiktas, who beat Feyenoord 5-2 in the previous round, Arsenal will be forced to make changes following injuries to Kieran Gibbs and Yaya Sanogo. Both are nursing hamstring injuries and have been left behind. ‘Gibbs will be out for three to four weeks and Sanogo wasn’t comfortable enough to travel,’ said Wenger. Mathieu Flamini, who missed Saturday’s league opener at the Emirates through illness, returns to the squad. Big threat: Arsenal will have to keep former Chelsea striker Demba Ba quiet if they are to progress . It is a compelling tie, coming up against a manager who was once the coolest kid in town when he was managing Croatia. Slaven Bilic’s career as a coach has never quite hit the same heights, but he is a popular and combustible character on the touchline. They are no slouches and Demba Ba, the striker acquired from Chelsea in the summer, scored a hat-trick in the second leg of their 3-1 victory over Feyenoord here in Istanbul. ‘We have a dream to make it all happen,’ admitted Bilic. ‘We have respect for our opponents because they are one of the strongest teams in Europe.’ Over two legs, they will also need to be the most stubborn.

At 36, with three Barclays Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the biggest one of the lot - the Champions League - his appetite for the game is undiminished.

Before Lampard arrived, City staff knew the stories about his extra shuttle runs after training and his dedication to the game during his career with Chelsea and England.

It was a small thing, a minor detail, but he was the only England player doing it. That discipline was instilled at a young age, when he chose to ignore the taunts of Martyn Mullen, one of the promising players coming through the youth set up with him at West Ham. ‘Oi, Lampard, what the **** are you doing?’ Mullen shouted across when he saw the young midfielder out on his own after training doing his doggies. It got a laugh from the other players and Lampard has never forgotten it. To this day, he still does them.

Instead he has even surprised City’s manager Manuel Pellegrini with his exceptional attitude and commitment to the game.

When he steered City’s equaliser beyond Thibaut Courtois, he was respectful and dignified, but that goal meant more than many of the 211 he scored in a Chelsea shirt. It proved to Lampard that he could still live with the game at this level. Lampard may have scored for City on Sunday, but the midfielder will always be a Chelsea hero . ‘I don’t speak about former players,’ was Jose Mourinho’s narky response following Lampard’s incredible impact on the game at the Etihad. It was Mourinho’s decision to let Lampard leave when Cesc Fabregas let it be known that Barcelona were prepared to sell him. During those fabulous tussles between the pair, when Fabregas was the chirpy upstart in an Arsenal shirt and Lampard was the main man in Chelsea’s midfield, they never got along. It was obvious, watching Lampard’s body language and demeanour, that he was determined to impose himself in every area of the midfield during those combative and compelling clashes. In all those fights, Fabregas never got the better of the Englishman in the centre of midfield. Even at 36, Lampard still dedicates more time on the training field than most other players . Andre Schurrle fires Chelsea ahead in the clash of the title rivals at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday . On Sunday, Lampard still had the upper hand after coming on to score that equaliser when City were down to 10 men. He is sensible enough to know that this cannot last for ever, that his time as a top class Premier League player will come to an end when he leaves for New York City in January. When the City option came up - initially he was supposed to play for Sheikh Mansour’s team in Australia - he spoke with his father  about his emotional attachment to Chelsea. Lampard will have wanted to get the upper hand of Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas (centre) It was pointed out to him that the great Bobby Moore, who was idolised by Frank Snr as a young professional at West Ham, went on to play for Fulham later in his career. He was still, quite rightly, cherished down at the Boleyn. Lampard - or Super Frank, as he is known at Stamford Bridge - is Chelsea through and through. Despite his goal on Sunday, they are still his team.","Frank Lampard is the ultimate professional and Chelsea will always be his club .

"In the Crystal Palace boardroom on Saturday there were hushed tones and quiet conversations taking place between the club’s owners. It was the first time they had met since the resignation of sporting director Iain Moody on Thursday and the decision to pull the plug on the potential appointment of Malky Mackay. They are numb, shocked by the nature of the allegations and disappointed that a valued member of the technical set-up at Selhurst Park has left. Still, they have vowed to fill the void. Decision maker: Steve Parish (right) will choose Tony Pulis' successor when the right candidate comes up . Tall order: Parish knows he will find it hard in choosing someone who can match Pulis' success at the club . Palace need a manager, someone to take them through the transfer window and beyond as they attempt to establish themselves in the Barclays Premier League. There is a temptation to appoint Keith Millen, who served under Ian Holloway and Tony Pulis, as the interim manager until another name emerges. The transfer window is another added pressure and there is a feeling within the club that they need to add some names to a squad who finished 11th in the Barclays Premier League last season. Millen has been speaking with the club’s scouting staff this week and intends to put forward some names as Palace plan for the future. There is a perception within the game that Palace’s co-chairman Steve Parish picks the players and is reluctant to spend big on new recruits. The reality is he prefers to cut out the middle man, negotiating directly with the selling club in an attempt to cut costs. It is sensible planning, even if it grates with some agents. Temporary charge: Keith Millen has led Crystal Palace to two straight defeats in the club's opening fixtures . Destroyer: Carlton Cole added more salt to Palace's wound by scoring West Ham's third at Selhurst Park . When Palace wanted to buy Gylfi Sigurdsson from Tottenham in the summer, Parish phoned their chairman Daniel Levy. A few days later, when Levy was trimming the fat from his squad at Spurs, he offered German midfielder Lewis Holtby to Palace. In the summer, when Pulis was plotting Palace’s strategy, a budget of around £25 million was set aside for incoming players. It is still there. Pulis’ name is a ghost in the corridors at Selhurst Park, stalking the club after he left, by mutual consent, 48 hours before the season’s opener against Arsenal. Palace are still wondering why he really left. Until Pulis breaks his silence, no one really knows. This week, in Palace’s central London offices, Parish’s email has been going off every few seconds with the CVs of managers all over the world. Sometimes the introductions are so vague it is impossible to tell whether the candidate concerned even knows he has applied for the job. Some managers have three, sometimes four, people claiming to be their official representative. Unexpected departure: Pulis decided the time was right to leave Crystal Palace after just 10 months at the club . Resignation: Sporting director Iain Moody (centre) had no choice but to resign from his role at Selhurst Park . Earlier in the week he had Moody there to help him, talking to agents and potential managers about the prospect of succeeding Pulis. All that changed when Moody went ‘white as a sheet’ after receiving a call from Sportsmail about the text messages he exchanged with Mackay when they were together at Cardiff. Within minutes he was sprinting to his lawyers and attempting to stop the story that ultimately led to his demise. Identifying the next Palace manager is Parish’s world now, sifting through applicants ranging from former Italian World Cup captain Fabio Cannavaro to Colombia’s World Cup coach Jose Pekerman. In the running: Colombia boss Jose Pekerman (left) and Italy's 2006 World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro (right) have thrown their name in the hat . None of them fits the bill. Parish wants someone who knows the ropes, a manager who has worked in the Premier League and kept teams out of the bottom three. He is prepared to wait, just as he did when Ian Holloway left last October. Until Thursday, Parish had the option to appoint former Spurs manager Tim Sherwood, but he since withdrawn himself from a race he described yesterday as ‘like the grand national’. Palace want a manager with pedigree, a name the players will respond to on the training ground. Pulis had that aura and was a commanding figure when he addressed the players. Replacing him will not be easy.","Former Eagles boss Tony Pulis left 48 hours before Palace's league opener .

"There will be two teams in Tallinn on Sunday but Mart Poom plans to inspire Estonia’s players with his tale of the day there was only one, and how it triggered his move to the Barclays Premier League and three encounters with the Queen. It is 18 years since the farcical World Cup qualifier that never was against Scotland and Poom is back in the Estonian capital. He works among other things as goalkeeper coach for the team which faces England in the Le Coq Arena and believes this can be the campaign when his country reaches its first major finals as an independent nation. Estonia coach Mart Poom, pictured during his playing days for Sunderland, is looking forward to facing England . England's players including (from left to right) Wayne Rooney, Calum Chambers and Phil Jagielka will be looking for a third straight Euro 2016 qualifying win in a row on Sunday . Estonia lost their last qualifier to Lithuania, courtesy of Saulius Mikoliunas's low header (pictured) But before they step out to face Roy Hodgson’s team of Premier League stars, the former Derby, Sunderland, Arsenal and Watford goalkeeper will remind them to seize the moment and trust in fate as he did when Estonia replayed that game against the Scots. ‘It was all very bizarre,’ said Poom. ‘That’s how I came about my chance and you never know if we had played the original game if that chance would have come. That’s how life goes. You have to take chances when you get them. ‘I will say the same thing when our lads go out against England. This is a great chance. Go out and make a name for yourselves.’ It was October 1996 and the story begins with Scotland complaining about the lights after a training session on the eve of the game. ‘We were playing in our old stadium and the temporary floodlights had been brought in from Finland,’ said Poom. ‘Scotland started to complain but we never believed they would change the kick-off time on the day of the game. Wayne Rooney slots home England's second goal against San Marino from the penalty spot . ‘We got up and trained in the morning. Then we heard the kick-off had been brought forward to 3pm. But no-one could believe it was possible. We were at out training camp (60 miles from the city) and all the kit was there. We stuck to the original plan and went to the stadium for a kick off at 6.45pm. ‘It was a mistake by UEFA. We were a new nation and they thought they could do what they wanted with us. At first Scotland thought they had won. But common sense appeared and they made us replay.’ When Scotland took to the field and kicked off alone at 3pm, the Tartan Army sang: ‘There’s only one team in Tallinn’. Initially, there were reports that Craig Brown’s team would be awarded a 3-0 win, but Estonia fought their corner and won the right to a replay. It was played four months later, in Monaco, by which time Derby manager Jim Smith was searching a new goalkeeper. Smith had signed Poom once before and called his old mate Alan Hodgkinson, then Scotland’s goalkeeping coach, to run the rule over him again. ‘I first signed for Portsmouth in ’94 when Jim was the manager,’ said Poom. ‘I came in from Wil in the Swiss first division and it was a big jump for me. There were very few foreigners in English football at the time. Pompey were in the Championship and a few eyebrows were raised when an Estonian goalkeeper arrived. ‘I couldn’t push Alan Knight from the No 1 spot and Estonia wasn’t EU at the time. My work permit wasn’t renewed and I returned to Estonia in ’96 but Jim kept an eye on me.’ Poom clutches the ball during Estonia's replay with Scotland during the 1998 World Cup qualifiers . Poom, pictured in action against Manchester United, earned a move to Derby after his display against Scotland . Poom performed well in a goalless draw in front of fewer than 4,000 in Monaco and Hodgkinson’s report sparked the move to Derby. He made his debut at Manchester United in the same game as Paulo Wanchope, who stole the show with a solo wonder-goal, stayed for six years and brought Pride Park to its feet when he scored the only goal of his career - a fabulous header - when he returned with Sunderland. ‘That was a special moment, because of the circumstances,’ said Poom. ‘When I left Derby I didn’t really have chance to say goodbye and on my first time back I scored an equaliser for Sunderland in the last minute. Scotland's Billy Dodds is denied by Poom in the game that earned the goalkeeper a chance with Derby . ‘I didn’t really celebrate but it was a great feeling. The goal was one thing but the reception after the final whistle was something else. I got a standing ovation from both sets of fans. I had a special relationship with the club. ‘My best years were probably at Derby and of course I am really honoured to be able to say I met Her Majesty three times. We exchanged a few pleasantries. She asked how long I’d been in England.’ Poom first met the Queen when she opened Pride Park and again when she was on her Golden Jubilee tour of Britain and he was one of the players selected to meet her when she was in Derbyshire. The third time was when the Arsenal players went to Buckingham Palace. The Queen had missed an appointment to open the Emirates Stadium because of a bad back so she invited Arsene Wenger’s squad to the Palace a few months later. During two years at Arsenal he also pocketed a Champions League runners-up medal. He was in the squad as cover and did not play but it was a nice souvenir as reward for putting Estonia on the map, at least as far as English football fans were concerned. He was in goal, eight years ago, when England were last in Tallinn. ‘Beaten by David Beckham’s crossing,’ recalled the 42-year-old, drily, when asked about the 3-0 defeat. It was the same score in the return at Wembley four months later. Poom went on to play for Sunderland (pictured), Watford and Arsenal during his time in England . Poom runs a coaching school in the city these days and works in the Estonian FA’s coach education programme but will be on the touchline tomorrow, part of Magnus Pehrsson’s coaching team as they try to recover from defeat in Lithuania on Thursday. ‘We saw the most important game as the one against Lithuania but everyone is up for England,’ said Poom. ‘The nation is looking forward to it. Tickets sold out very quickly. It’s not a big stadium, about a 10,000 capacity but people are close to the pitch and it will be a great atmosphere, like the older grounds in England. ‘Our only chance is to stick to the game-plan, be disciplined and really fight. We have spirit and the new qualifying format is better for smaller nations like Estonia. Players and fans all have higher expectations. In the last Euros we were close. We got to the play-offs and lost to Ireland. We have a chance. We can do this.’","Mart Poom impressed during a 0-0 draw with Scotland in 1997 .

The German FA said Ozil has a ‘partial tear’ of his lateral collateral ligament, will not be fit for the international fixtures against Poland and Republic of Ireland and will not be back for next month’s games against Gibraltar and Spain. Arsenal’s fitness coach Shad Forsythe also works with Germany — he will step down from his international role after these fixtures — but the north London club refused to confirm the severity of Ozil’s injury until their record signing is back at the club. They will perform their own assessment of the injury but the 25-year-old is clearly facing a long spell out.

"After the first hat-trick of his professional career, Danny Welbeck was on rock-solid ground as he launched into a defence of his goalscoring record. Three in the Champions League for Arsenal against Galatasaray took his tally to six in 10 games for club and country this season, all scored from a central position, which he insists is the key to an extended run in the goals. ‘Nobody can really criticise my finishing because they don’t really see me playing in a forward position too often,’ said Welbeck. Danny Welbeck scored a hat-trick for Arsenal in their 4-1 win against Galatasaray on Wednesday . Danny Welbeck chips the on-rushing Fernando Muslera to complete his Champions League hat-trick . ‘But now I’m getting into these positions I want to be sticking the ball in the back of the net. ‘I’m sure it’s the same with every other striker. People can say I’ve not scored enough goals, but you stick the best strikers on the wing in a four-man midfield and see if they score goals. ‘If you’re getting goals and getting a run of games in your preferred position, your confidence is going to grow and performances are going to grow. That’s something I’m looking forward to doing, building on those performances. Danny Welbeck's hat-trick and Alexis Sanchez's striker were enough for Arsenal to beat Galatasaray . England manager Roy Hodgson watched the action from the stands at the Emirates . ‘Maybe beforehand I wasn’t getting through on goal if I was coming from midfield. It’s difficult to leave your position to go and get goalscoring opportunities, but I’m getting into these positions much more regularly now, and I’m looking forward to sticking the ball in the back of the net.’ Former Arsenal manager George Graham was among those who criticised Welbeck in front of goal. ‘Welbeck is a very willing boy,’ said Graham. ‘He works his socks off for the team. He’s got to improve his finishing a lot though.’ Two for England against Switzerland last month was a good start and three against Galatasaray on Wednesday even better, but the £16million signing from Manchester United has to prove he can be just as clinical in the big games against the big teams, starting against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Arsenal had an awful record away from home against the best teams in the Barclays Premier League last season. They were beaten 6-3 at Manchester City, 5-1 at Liverpool and 6-0 at Chelsea. Olivier Giroud, in 15 games against those same three teams, has scored only twice. Welbeck’s record is similar, with one goal in 23 games against the same opposition for Manchester United and Arsenal, although some of those appearances were on the wing or from the bench. Danny Welbeck wasn't given a run of games as a central striker during his time at Manchester United . Danny Welbeck scored both goals for England in their 2-0 win over Switzerland in Basle . He has made a promising start to his Arsenal career, rekindling memories of Thierry Henry with his finishing style on Wednesday, but this is the challenge he must rise to if he is to develop like Henry into a truly great striker. England boss Roy Hodgson was at the Emirates to see Welbeck’s hat-trick before confirming his place in the squad yesterday for next week’s Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia. ‘It seems to me in the days of very large transfer fees that £16million does seem a fairly reasonable price to pay,’ said Hodgson.

"COMMENT: Soloists sabotage the team ethic at Swansea City . Swansea's preparations for Sunday's home defeat by Chelsea were undermined by an amazing training-ground fight. The . extraordinary incident involved six players from the first-team squad . and took place during a full-scale practice match last Wednesday. Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins was left stunned after witnessing the fierce clashes between players. Crisis: Swansea manager Garry Monk saw his bid to repair squad rift backfire . Although he has not taken disciplinary action against those involved, Jenkins is becoming increasingly alarmed about the friction in the Swansea dressing room. According to training-ground sources, there were three incidents during the high-tempo session organised by interim manager Garry Monk. It is understood players had to be separated after tempers flared and tackles got out of hand. The incredible scenes will do nothing to help morale at the club. Monk, who took over when Michael Laudrup was fired, is attempting to repair relations between the players and unite the squad as they try to avoid relegation.

"It was always going to take something out of the ordinary to beat Hugo Lloris in this kind of mood and it did — an extraordinary piece of slapstick defending from Vlad Chiriches to concede a late penalty. Like an accident trying to happen or a centre half with his shoelaces tied together, Chiriches misjudged a long punt out of the sky and then turned and handled the ball inside the penalty area as he tried to recover from his initial slip. Demba Ba stepped up to convert from the spot and Tottenham had to settle for a point. ‘I don’t talk about Vlad’s actions,’ said manager Mauricio Pochettino. ‘It was unfortunate. In football you can always make a mistake. We need to accept that. But it was disappointing to concede the goal in the last minute.

Spurs have won only one of their last seven and although the draw was a fair result they seemed set to defy the negative spiral when Harry Kane fired them ahead and Lloris set about protecting the lead with a series of stunning saves. ‘He’s one of the best, he is complete, he’s brilliant,’ said Besiktas boss Slaven Bilic about Lloris, although the goalkeeper really ought to have been retrieving the ball from his net in the opening seconds after the first mistake of the night by Chiriches, who gave the ball to Jose Sosa, who touched it to Olcay Sahan, darting in from the left. Sahan nudged a pass towards Ba but both he and Federico Fazio missed it as they wrestled each other to the ground and Sahan picked it up on the other side but, with only Lloris to beat, slid his effort wide. It was an incredible chance, the first of three for the winger, who gave Eric Dier all sorts of problems but could not conjure a finish. Sahan was denied by Lloris, just before half-time and went close with an acrobatic volley after the interval. More opportunities were never far away with Chiriches and Fazio at the back. Chiriches is quick across the turf and Fazio strong in the air, but they offer so much hope to strikers with their loose marking and casual distribution. Ba crashed an effort into the woodwork in the first half after Fazio failed to cut out a cross from the left. He required two attempts to get it under control before thumping a right-footer against the frame of the goal, where the post meets the bar. The former West Ham, Newcastle and Chelsea striker left his mark on Chiriches physically as well as psychologically with a stray arm across the face, forcing the Spurs defender to spend most of the game with cotton-wool plugs in his nostrils. Ba was booked for the foul. Having started with such intent, Besiktas were rocked by Kane’s strike midway through the half. There was little sign of danger when Nabil Bentaleb rolled a short pass forward but the visitors switched off.

Kane took a couple of touches, moving right to left across the field, worked the ball on to his left foot and drove a low shot back across goalkeeper Tolga Zengin. What it lacked in ferocity it made up for with accuracy and crept inside the post. There may come a point soon when Pochettino has to promote him to the first team — the team he plays in the Barclays Premier League. Kane has four goals despite having started only four games this season, all in Europe. He has only appeared for 39 minutes in the league, where Spurs have failed to win in their last four and face Pochettino’s former club Southampton on Sunday. Kane may not have the finesse and sophistication of other individuals around him in the Tottenham squad but his work-rate is exceptional and he has a goal knack. The goal knocked the Turks out of their rhythm. The tempo dropped and Spurs enjoyed more possession with Kane looking for a second. Zengin made a good block from a fierce strike on the angle and he was denied again by a fabulous save from the keeper, 20 minutes from time.

Ba slid it into the corner after a stuttering run-up. Group C is tight, with Asteras Tripolis of Greece top after beating Partizan Belgrade, who are bottom, last night, with Spurs and Besiktas in between on two points. ‘To concede that late is very disappointing,’ said Kane. ‘We wanted to win to take forward the momentum.

"A wet Wednesday in Watford and Roy Hodgson stirred in the face of what might prove to be among his toughest tasks of the week: summoning the right amount of enthusiasm while remaining polite about the world’s worst international team. Hodgson set about it in brisk fashion, fixing a new target on the horizon for his England players to complete this qualification campaign with a perfect set of 10 wins. Having emerged triumphant from the first and, on paper, the trickiest fixture, against Switzerland in Basle, why not? Reaching Euro 2016 is no longer much of an accomplishment for England and that is nobody’s fault but UEFA’s. Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling are planning a goal blitz . Roy Hodgson has set his sights on a perfect record from their Euro 2016 qualifiers . San Marino at Wembley on Thursday night will not present a problem. Estonia in Tallinn on Sunday is perhaps a little tougher but should not disturb the plan. ‘There are 10 qualifying matches,’ said Hodgson. ‘In the last 10, we won six and drew four. It would be nice to go through this qualifying campaign unbeaten. If we get two good results, we’ll set ourselves the target of winning all the games.’ England’s qualification campaign for the World Cup in Brazil was about as unimpressive as a group-topping unbeaten campaign can be. Of the six wins, four were against San Marino and Moldova. England skipper Wayne Rooney wants to break Sir Bobby Charlton's goal record . Hodgson hopes England can continue their perfect start against San Marino at Wembley . It was not until the final two games that a decent team were beaten, when Hodgson’s side burst into life to finish with wins at home to Montenegro and Poland. This time, the England boss would like more panache and there were signs of that in Basle last month, when Danny Welbeck scored twice in a new system, with Raheem Sterling playing at the top of a midfield diamond. The key will be to preserve that momentum over the next two games. ‘I’m looking very much at the movement of our front players and midfielders, which is something we’ve worked on for a long time,’ said Hodgson. Danny Welbeck is expected to spearhead England's attack following his two-goal blast against Switzerland . ‘And for the same level of defensive commitment we showed against Switzerland in terms of winning the ball back quickly and sustaining attacks. ‘I’d be disappointed if the pace of our play dropped enormously because we’re getting a lot of the ball. I want us to put pressure on ourselves to keep the tempo up. ‘I know the players would like to do that. In football, things don’t always work out the way you hope. But I’m very confident that the players will want to give me and the country the performance I expect.’ James Milner hopes England can use their World Cup flop in Brazil as a driving force . Rooney and Hodgson spoke to the press at their Watford base on Wednesday . He swerved the idea that nations with a pedigree as poor as San Marino’s, alongside Bhutan at the bottom of FIFA’s rankings, ought to face a pre-qualifying round to earn the right to play at this stage of the competition. ‘It’s a question for UEFA,’ said Hodgson. ‘But if they play the game properly, it’s not such a bad thing that there’s this discrepancy.’ The last time San Marino’s assortment of computer scientists, interior designers and two professional footballers appeared at Wembley, they did not roll over quite as they were supposed to. They held out for more than half an hour before conceding from a penalty and goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini clobbered Theo Walcott, forcing him off inside 10 minutes and out of the next game in Poland. England won 5-0 and it was more routine in San Marino, when an own goal was the first of eight. Hodgson has urged his England troops to play at a high tempo against the part-timers . On both occasions, it was the first game in a double-header and Hodgson changed six players for the more difficult second game, although neither of the difficult games in question was won. These are the imponderables. Hodgson reflected on his time in the Europa League at Fulham when he found those he rested from the competition were worse in the next game than those who had played. So, the England boss insisted there would be ‘no wholesale changes’ to the team which performed well in Switzerland. Even so, do not be surprised to see key men replaced after an hour. An injury to John Stones means there will be at least one change, with Arsenal teenager Calum Chambers expected to start his first senior international. Fabian Delph, who sat out training on Tuesday, was involved again on Wednesday and is available. San Marino trained at Wembley on Wednesday night ahead of the Group E qualifier . ‘We’re keen to keep the momentum going,’ said Hodgson. ‘It’s important we’re taking it seriously. Everyone is anxious to play. The players deserve further confidence. We’ve got to weigh the two things: keeping the team together but also using one of these games as a chance to see someone else play. ‘At management level you never work without fear and every game is important. I don’t think any of us want a complacent life in football. ‘We want to test ourselves and set ourselves standards. I want this team to grow and to look back in two years’ time saying, “We’ve come a long way”. These two matches are important steps along the way. Jonjo Shelvey (left) will be hoping to win his second England cap on Thursday night . ‘The players need to continue showing they have this burning desire to play good football.’ There are also personal motivations, notably for Wayne Rooney, who will win his 98th cap and hopefully move closer to Sir Bobby Charlton’s goal record. And for Chambers, if he starts, as well as Nathaniel Clyne, who may win his first cap, and Jonjo Shelvey, who may win his second.","Three Lions got off to the perfect start with win in Switzerland last month .

"Jose Mourinho returned to his native Portugal anxious not to offend Sporting Lisbon - the club who gave him his big break - but the biggest compliment he could lavish upon them was to confirm his plan to start with Diego Costa up front. Costa's participation is ever shrouded in doubt as he nurses tight hamstrings but with Didier Drogba left behind in London with an ankle injury Mourinho has decided to risk his eight-goal striker rather than play Loic Remy at centre-forward. 'In this moment, if Diego can play, I play Diego,' said the Chelsea boss. 'The team had a pre-season with him. The team worked with him a lot of times. He's playing with us every match in the Premier League. So the team at this moment is more made to play with Diego. Jose Mourinho confirmed that Diego Costa will start Champions League tie on Tuesday . Chelsea striker Diego Costa was in high spirits during training on Monday . 'I think Remy is learning how to play with us. His pace is good, his movement is good, he can get behind defenders, he's not bad in the air. He has some similarities with Diego and if he has to play, no problem. But I prefer to play Diego. 'There is a risk, yes. But we assume the risk and he plays. I don't rest people. I make decisions. I don't think about Arsenal on Sunday. I think about Sporting. I'm going to start with the team I think is the best team.' It is a clue to how pivotal Mourinho suspects this game may be. All the teams in Group G go into the second game with one point and one goal. A win in the Alvalade Stadium will put Chelsea in control before back-to-back games against Maribor of Slovenia, the team expected to be the weakest in the group. Costa's participation is ever shrouded in doubt as he nurses tight hamstrings . Mourinho prefers to play Costa instead of starting new signing Loic Remy as centre forward . Willian and Mourinho at a press conference in Lisbon, Portugal on Monday . There is also the emotion of a return to the club where it all started for him in 1992, when Sir Bobby Robson invited him onto his backroom staff. Asked how it felt to return all these years later as one of the finest managers of his generation, he replied: 'Pride; a sense of pride. I was all I could be at this club. I tried to help the team the best way I could, at the beginning of my career.' In an interview yesterday with the Portuguese newspaper Record he described his first role at Sporting as 'the do-it-all-boy'. He was born and raised in Setabul, 20 miles south of Lisbon, where there is now a street named in his honour. Nani, William Carvalho and Islam Slimani will be on Chelsea's radar when they step out in Lisbon . This year's Champions League involves six coaches from Portugal, more than any other country. They are Mourinho, Sporting boss Marco Silva, Andre Villas-Boas now at Zenit, Jorge Jesus of Benfica and Leonardo Jardim at Monaco. For the younger generation, Mourinho is a mould-breaker; the one who gave them the confidence to take what they knew to bigger football nations. 'He is the master of leadership and motivation, he is the No.1,' said 37-year-old Silva, last night, aware that facing Chelsea would be the biggest test of his young coaching career. Mourinho talks to Cesc Fabregas as they prepare for Champions League tie in Lisbon . Mourinho after all is plotting a third Champions League win with a third different club and his team are unbeaten this season. His last game in Portugal was with Chelsea against Porto in February 2007. 'I'm not expecting to be received with special affection,' said Mourinho. 'I did nothing for Sporting. I limited myself to my insignificance. But I didn't do anything important to justify being received with particular hostility, and I've never stopped showing the utmost respect for Sporting and pride that a small part of my career was conducted there. Let it be the way people think it should be. 'The only bad memory I have of my time here is when I left. There is no grudge, no sense of ill-feeling. It's been a long time since I faced a Portuguese team, and it is a great joy to return. This will be a match like all others in terms of emotion. If I could choose, ultimately, the outcome of this group, I would place Chelsea No.1 and Sporting No.2.' Drogba is expected to be out for at least two weeks with his ankle injury. Ramires is also absent with a groin problem.","Jose Mourinho has decided to risk Diego Costa rather than play Loic Remy at centre-forward .

"Jonjo Shelvey has been recalled by England despite the fact manager Roy Hodgson knew he had become ‘reticent’ to play for the Under 21 team. At 22, Shelvey is still eligible for Gareth Southgate’s U21s even though he has not been selected for more than a year, since pulling out of a squad for games against Finland and Moldova in September 2013, a year after winning his only senior cap to date. ‘I believe Gareth spoke to him and he was reticent, maybe, to play in a game or two,’ said Hodgson. ‘As a result Gareth chose other people, as he’s quite entitled to do. If he did turn him down he wouldn’t be the first. I’ve had people turn down first-team national places, which I’ll keep to myself. Jonjo Shelvey has been recalled to the England squad by manager Roy Hodgson . Roy Hodgson says Jonjo Shelvey was 'reticent' to play for the Under 21s . ‘It may well be that Jonjo, having already played for the first team, might have felt that being asked to play for the Under 21s was stepping back down after, in his eyes, stepping up.’ Hodgson worked with Shelvey at Liverpool and gave the midfielder his full England debut in a World Cup qualifier against San Marino in October 2012. He was an unused substitute four days later in Poland, a game which was delayed by a day due to rain in Warsaw. He was then named in a squad for a friendly in Sweden in November 2012, only to withdraw with a thigh injury, and was not named in the senior squad again until Thursday. Jonjo Shelvey won his 13th cap for the Under 21s in a friendly with Scotland last year . In between, Shelvey dropped back into the Under 21 squad, winning his 13th U21 cap in a friendly against Scotland last year when Hodgson was in charge during the void between Stuart Pearce and Southgate. He played very well against the Scots and it seems was not entirely happy to find he had not been promoted back to the seniors a month later, and left staff with the impression that he felt more experience at U21 level was not going to help his development. Shelvey insists he never refused to play for England. He has played through the ranks for the U16, U17 and U19 and, on Thursday, spoke of his delight at being back in the senior squad. Jonjo Shelvey worked with Roy Hodgson during their time together at Liverpool . ‘It’s fantastic to be called up by England at any level, but to be called up to the senior side is a very proud moment for me,’ said Shelvey. ‘A lot of it is down to Garry Monk and the coaching staff here at Swansea with the way they have got us playing. We’ve earned a lot of praise for that. During the last international break there was only about eight of us here training, so it’s a credit to everyone at Swansea for earning international recognition.’ When he initially left Shelvey out last November Southgate, rather unconvincingly, said: ‘I had a feeling he might be with the seniors anyway, so I didn’t want to necessarily pick a player that I didn’t think would be with us for long.’ Gareth Southgate turned to other options after Jonjo Shelvey was selected for the senior squad . After Shelvey’s withdrawal from his squad last year, Southgate quickly turned to other options in midfield and his side won their qualification group in style. They will secure a place at next summer’s European U21 Championship in the Czech Republic if they can beat Croatia in a two-legged play-off. Shelvey has started the new campaign in terrific form for Swansea and was disappointed not to be part of Hodgson’s first squad of the season, when midfielders Fabian Delph and Jack Colback were picked, but Hodgson does not have such a wealth of available players that he can afford to take a stance on a point of principle. Nathaniel Clyne has been called up to the England senior squad for the first time . Shelvey was called up for the games against San Marino and Estonia — along with Southampton’s Nathaniel Clyne — and Hodgson added: ‘I know his qualities as a player as I worked with him and now it’s a good moment to come into the squad and show me, “This is where I belong”.’ Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw will return to the U21 squad after recently winning their first senior England caps. Hodgson said: ‘We have made it clear to the players that just because you have been asked into the senior national squad that doesn’t mean you will never play for anyone else. Calum Chambers could play for the U20s. ‘Our players must have the humility to understand they play where we think it is best. We will also take great consideration of their feelings because we don’t intend to ride roughshod over anyone.’","Swansea City star called up for games against San Marino and Estonia .

"Mikel Arteta can recall days standing on the game’s edge, watching the ball sailing through the sky towards Duncan Ferguson, so he does not hesitate to defend Arsene Wenger against accusations of too much flair and too little caution. ‘I’ve played in lots of different teams,’ said Arteta. ‘I’ve played long balls and short balls and, believe me, if you love football you want to play the Arsenal way. ‘When I joined Everton and we had big Duncan Ferguson, Alan Stubbs and David Weir, the football was very direct because of the players we had. David Moyes started to buy more quality players and tactics progressed, but at the start we were very physical. Mikel Arteta has praised Arsene Wenger's style of football ahead of the north London derby . The Spaniard has revealed he thought his club manager was going to leave the club at the end of last season . Arteta reserved special praise for team-mates Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) and Mesut Ozil (right) ‘We were the best in the league at doing that, so why would we not play long ball? That’s why he put me on the wing, so I could cross the ball, as I didn’t get it in midfield. ‘Arsenal don’t have to change. The manager believes in this style 100 per cent but we have to find our defensive solidity. It’s one thing to be cautious and another to be careless.’ Arsenal’s new captain is protective of the Wenger philosophy. The 32-year-old Basque shares the same principles not only in style of football but also regarding loyalty in the dressing room. ‘He defends his players 100 per cent and that’s something that matters,’ said Arteta. That does not change if it is teenage full back Hector Bellerin or the club’s record signing Mesut Ozil, who responded to criticism last week with a goal at Aston Villa. ‘When you have players like Ozil with everything he involves — his price, his personality — people will either love him or not like him at all,’ said Arteta. ‘When you’re an artist, you’re never going to perform nine out of 10 every week. It’s much more difficult for a creative player to perform at that level. Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta used to play alongside Mauricio Pochettino during his time at PSG . Arteta has revealed Tottenham boss Pochettino used to treat him like a son when they were club team-mates . They met in Paris in 2001 and the bond remains unbroken, although it might be tested when Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta faces a Tottenham side managed by his former team-mate Mauricio Pochettino on Saturday. ‘He was like a father figure for me,’ said Arteta, as he explained how centre half Pochettino took him under his wing when he joined Paris Saint-Germain on loan from Barcelona. ‘He really looked after me as a young player and I appreciate what he did for me. It was the start of my career and I’d just come into the team. ‘I was playing in front of the back four and he was the centre back, the captain. He has been one of my biggest influences and showed me how to behave as a footballer.' ‘The opposition always try and stop you, so sometimes you don’t shine. And then people ask: “Why don’t you shine? You didn’t do anything in the game.” When that happens you get criticised, especially when it happens in big games. But you cannot deny Ozil is a special player: his movement, his calmness, his final ball is superb.’ Arteta has witnessed high quality at close quarters during a career spanning 15 years. ‘At Barcelona, we had Rivaldo and the way he hit the ball was unbelievable,’ said the Arsenal captain. ‘In terms of quality, technique, imagination, the best was probably Ronaldinho. Some of the things he did with the ball I had never seen in my life. It was ridiculous. But we have talented players at Arsenal.’ Arteta picked out Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. He lovingly described him as ‘one of my little joys’ and added: ‘The potential he has is second to none. If he really wants to, really focuses, he can go to the very top. ‘He has the speed and skill to become an unbelievable winger, but he has the vision of a midfielder, and that’s very difficult to find. Defensively, he needs to improve, but he has time and people to help him.’ Arteta admits he had started to wonder about Arsenal without Wenger. At two goals down to Hull in the FA Cup final, with the manager’s unsigned contract still on the table, doubts played on his mind. ‘He wasn’t clear with his future,’ said Arteta. ‘He always said he wanted to stay but he didn’t sign. In the semi-final — or even in the final — we never knew what was going to happen. If we lost the Hull game we’d be talking about a different story. That would have started a period of reflection and decision. It was a big game in Arsenal’s history. We won the first trophy in nine years. ‘You can go from being criticised to being hailed very quickly. But I worry for the young lads. When I came to the UK, what I liked about the culture was that clubs protected their players and made it hard for people to knock your confidence. But now it’s impossible.’","The Spaniard had doubts regarding his manager's future at the club .

"It has been a long wait for Roberto Soldado. More than six months since his last goal at White Hart Lane, but when it came, it was perfectly timed. In slid Soldado to divert yet another low grubber from Andros Townsend past Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Dorus de Vries and so fire Tottenham into a date with Brighton in the fourth round of the Capital One Cup. Perhaps more importantly, the Spanish striker saved Spurs when they seemed destined for 30 minutes of extra-time, the possibility of penalties and a further waste of nervous energy, just three days before their trip to Arsenal. Roberto Soldado wheeled off in celebration after putting his side in the lead for the first time during the game . Harry Kane finished off the scoring by grabbing Tottenham's third goal against Stuart Pearce's side in the 90th minute . Ryan Mason came off the substitutes' bench to score an all-important equaliser for his side . Nottingham Forest starlet Jorge Grant opened the scoring at White Hart Lane in the 61st minute . Grant was mobbed by his Nottingham Forest team-mate Jamie Paterson after scoring his first competitive goal in English football . SPURS 4231: Vorm 6; Naughton 6, Fazio 6, Vertonghen 6, Davies 6; Stambouli 5.5 (Mason 64, 7), Bentaleb 6; Townsend 7.5, Paulinho 6.5 (Kane 64, 7), Lennon 6; Soldado 6 (Lamela 84).

SUBS: Darlow, Collins, Halford, Walker, Blackstock. MANAGER: Stuart Pearce 6. MOM: Andros Townsend. REF: Andre Marriner 6 . ATT: 31,912 . Only eight minutes remained when Soldado pounced. What a welcome relief it was for Pochettino, who has seen his team struggle through four games without a win and watched them go behind on Wednesday night to a goal from Forest teenager Jorge Grant on his debut. The upset looked very much on, at this point. Forest had played with great intensity and were worth their lead. The travelling supporters, many wearing green sweatshirts in tribute to Brian Clough who died 10 years ago, sang ‘Psycho is back’. Manager Stuart Pearce swung his fist through the air, but Pochettino reacted and finally managed to inject some urgency into his side with an influential double change. On came Ryan Mason to score his first ever Tottenham goal to level the tie and Harry Kane, who grabbed his team’s third in stoppage time. In between was Soldado’s first goal at home since early March. Three goals in 18 minutes had punctured Forest’s fun but the green shoots of progress on the field are more important than the green jumpers of tribute in the away end. ‘It was a great performance and one the club should be proud of,’ said Pearce. ‘It doesn’t sit comfortably with me when we get beaten. I am disappointed we lost, but it was against a very good side who cost multi-millions. It shows Nottingham Forest is going in the right direction. We’re making baby steps and we have to continue pushing the club in that direction.’ It’s true Pearce has them upwardly mobile: top of the Championship and full of confidence as they tackled opponents from the Barclays Premier League. Pochettino changed all 11 of those who started against West Brom on Sunday but Forest also made it clear they have other priorities, with nine changes of their own. Top scorer Britt Assombalonga did not even travel to London. Amid the blur, there was and home debuts for Benjamin Stambouli and Federico Fazio and a debut for goalkeeper Michel Vorm, who was beaten by Ben Osborn in the first half but saved by his woodwork.

It was a fabulous dribble by Osborn, who slipped past Fazio and unleashed a fierce left-footer, which curled past Vorm’s dive, crashed into the bar and back into the goalmouth. Stambouli and Fazio were among those who seemed caught out by Forest’s desire and intensity. Tottenham were sluggish. In the first half, all they had by way of attacking intent was an ambitious appeal for a penalty from Paulinho, after the slightest of shirt-tugs by Danny Fox, and long-range punts from Townsend and Fazio. Paulinho went close after the break but Forest went ahead in the 61st minute. Lars Veldwijk was given time to work the ball across goal from the left, Stephen McLaughlin flicked it at the near post and Grant arrived totally unmarked to convert from eight yards out. Pochettino sent on his substitutes and Mason soon equalised with a brilliant swerving strike from 25 yards, although goalkeeper De Vries might think he could have done more to keep it out. ‘I’ve been waiting for that for a long time,’ said Mason. ‘I’ve always been confident in ability. I’ve had to wait a lot longer than others but I thought I made a difference.’ He did. Tottenham finished strongly. Townsend rattled the bar with a free-kick, before his effort was turned in by Soldado to lift the mood. Kane made it three, low from an angle after a pass from Erik Lamela. ‘I was calm, because we needed to be calm, after this disaster,’ smiled Pochettino. ‘We always believed we could come back into the game. I am happy for the players. They never gave up. This is the mentality we need to have.’ http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2768378/Capital-One-Cup-fourth-round-draw-Chelsea-travel-League-Two-Shrewsbury-Spurs-face-Brighton-Liverpool-play-Swansea.html .

"Mauricio Pochettino revels in hostility, he says, which is fortunate because his first derby against Arsenal is swiftly followed by a Europa League tie against Besiktas and a clash with Southampton, the club he quit for Tottenham. It promises to be a testing week for the new Spurs boss and he is arming himself with memories of success playing for Paris Saint-Germain in the home of their fierce rivals, Marseille. ‘It was difficult to leave the stadium,’ said Pochettino. ‘It was difficult to arrive, as well. We had all the windows closed and everyone was lying on the floor. In the dressing room and on the coach, the windows were broken. It was dangerous. You need to be brave in Marseille if you play for PSG.’ Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino believes he is ready for Saturday's north London derby . Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta used to play alongside Pochettino during his time at Paris Saint-Germain . Arteta has spoken of the hostile reception PSG used to receive at the Stade Velodrome . Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta played in one of those games alongside Pochettino and told how PSG boss Luis Fernandez became the touchline target for a barrage of missiles from the home crowd at the Stade Velodrome, including radios, mobile phones and golf balls. ‘He picked up one phone and held it to his ear and said “Hello”,’ said Arteta, another veteran of the world’s hottest rivalries. The Arsenal captain has witnessed derby day in Glasgow and Liverpool, as well as in the Basque Country. After Pochettino’s early career in South America, however, a trip into Islington should hold no fears. While playing for Newell’s Old Boys in the 1992 Copa Libertadores semi-final in the Colombian city of Cali, his team-mate Eduardo Berizzo, who is now the manager of Celta Vigo, left the pitch with blood pouring from a wound on his head after being hit by a battery. Pochettino played at PSG for two years after moving to the French capital from Spanish outfit Espanyol . Both sides will be hoping they can do their talking on the pitch rather than being involved in confrontations . Arsenal winger Theo Walcott wound up Tottenham fans in January while being carried off on a stretcher . Pochettino claimed he would be happy to assume a familiar position on the floor of the team bus on the way to the Emirates Stadium. ‘It is not strange for me,’ he smiled, but he was not joking when he added: ‘I am stronger in the hostile situation. I like it.’ Fortunately, the north London derby rarely reaches such extreme levels, but it has been an uncomfortable ride for Tottenham managers in recent years. Including David Pleat, who was caretaker for most of the 2003-4 season, Pochettino is Spurs’ 12th manager since Arsene Wenger arrived at Arsenal. The others, for the record, are Gerry Francis, Christian Gross, George Graham, Glenn Hoddle, Jacques Santini, Martin Jol, Juande Ramos, Harry Redknapp, Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood. If he finds the instability amusing, Wenger managed to disguise it on Friday, insisting his personal hold over Spurs (he has lost only six of 43) is not important compared to the wider picture of finishing in the top four. ‘I honestly do not look at the satisfaction of my job by comparing it to Spurs,’ said Wenger. ‘I am more proud to achieve our targets every year. That was to be in the Champions League — apart from that most of the time to be in the Champions League, one of our rivals was Tottenham. For many years it was them or us and we always managed to get above them.’ WHAT IS WRONG WITH ARSENAL... It's been a bit of a mixed bag this season and they are inconsistent. Injuries have not helped and Arsene Wenger still has to work out his best XI. THE SOLUTION... Once Wenger cracks the code, they can produce big things this season. WHAT IS WRONG WITH TOTTENHAM... With three managers in less than a year, there has to be some sympathy for the players. That lack of stability is affecting the performances. THE SOLUTION... Pochettino has to see who in the squad can cut it. Bust must do so quickly. He did, however, accept that fulfilling those ambitions was never harder than during the years when his club were locked into the process of building a new stadium, a project Tottenham are about to embark upon. ‘It is massively difficult,’ said Wenger. ‘If you look at the history of all the English clubs who have built a new stadium and look at where they have finished, then it tells you how difficult it is... when we were in a position where we had to be in the Champions League just financially and you get into March/April and you are not, that is extremely difficult. ‘The stress is terrible, because you feel the future of the club is at stake and you have not a lot of margin. Every point you lose can be dramatic.’ Asked how Spurs might cope, Wenger said: ‘It depends what kind of financial potential they have. It looks like they want to sell the club. If an owner comes in, and puts down £400million to buy the stadium, it is easy. ‘The way we did it is the hardest way, because we had no outside financial help. We had to negotiate with the banks just to get the money at the start. Let’s not forget we paid £120m just for the ground, we contributed to build a rubbish centre at Islington. ‘We had a lot of financial problems. In the end, we built the stadium for £400m. Today it would cost £600m or £700m.’","Tottenham travel to the Emirates to face Arsenal on Saturday evening .

"Barely 10 minutes had gone when Roy Hodgson left his seat and adopted an uneasy stance on the touchline, a few yards from Fabian Delph, who was already beginning to look like a red card in a white shirt. Hodgson’s team selection had been bold and here it was in danger backfiring. It seemed a matter of when not if Delph would commit the foul which cut short his first start for his country. Fortunately for all concerned, the quiet word, or the sight of James Milner being sent out to warm up, did the trick. VIDEO Scroll down to watch England players stepped up - Hodgson . Competitive debut: Fabian Delph made his first competitive appearance for England . Delph got hold of his emotions, cooled his mind and produced a confident display packed with the energy and desire which will give the England boss hope that with a little polish this crazy diamond can shine on. It needs more work and it has defensive frailties. Jack Wilshere is not a natural Pirlo with his instinct to carry the ball, not pass it on, but even during the course of the game, it was possible to see Hodgson’s players coming to terms with a system designed to offer more freedom to Raheem Sterling. In the first half Sterling was too often smothered and roughed-up in congested areas. Later in the game, he became influential. He was involved in both goals and was a real threat once England were ahead and the Swiss pushed forward. Booked: Delph was given a yellow card after just nine minutes . Penalty appeal: Delph could have earned England a spot kick when he was challenged by Johan Djourou . Hitting the front: How two-goal hero Danny Welbeck gave England the lead in Basel . If it is to work, Hodgson needs those on outside of his diamond to have the legs to cover ground and quality to keep the ball. Jordan Henderson has established himself in the last 12 months and last night Delph repaid Hodgson’s faith. This was not the first time he has trusted youth and inexperience at vital moments in defiance of his reputation for caution. He threw 18-year-old Alex Oxlade- Chamberlain into the first game of Euro 2012 and the hardest fixture of the group, against France. It was Ox’s first competitive international, just as it was for Sterling when Hodgson moved Wayne Rooney left in order to play the teenager in the No.10 role, against Italy in the World Cup opener in Manaus. His gamble last year on Andros Townsend was a spectacular success. The Tottenham winger sparkled on debut and scored the third in a 4-1 win against Montenegro, England’s penultimate World Cup qualifier and one they had to win. Commited: The Aston Villa midfielder gave an impressive performance against Switzerland . Goal: Delph celebrates with England goalscorer Danny Welbeck . VIDEO England players stepped up - Hodgson . Last night in Basle, it was a game they could not afford to lose. Out went the flying wingers and in came Delph for his second cap, after a promising 21 minutes as a substitute against Norway last week. He opened with an explosive burst down the flank left past adventurous right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner and a quick snap into a clean challenge to win the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri in midfield. On the ball he was sure and confident. He passed it well and linked up with Leighton Baines. He was not overawed. Off it, he simmered with aggression and a thread of recklessness which rarely goes down well with officials in European football. Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir needed less than nine minutes to show Delph his yellow card. It was for late sliding tackle which took over Lichtsteiner, and it might have been worse. Cakir would have been within his rights to book him moments when he cut through Valon Behrami from behind. Fortunately, the referee played the advantage and the angry reaction from the crowd had been quelled by the time he came to tick off the Villa midfielder. This fearless tenacity has always been part of the appeal. He was still a youth team player at Leeds when he wiped out manager Dennis Wise in a training game. Wise being Wise was impressed and quickly promoted him. Tackle: England's new star goes in strongly on Stephan Lichtsteiner . Line up: Delph (bottom right) was rewarded for some impressive performances for Aston Villa . After this breakthrough at Elland Road and a £6million transfer to Aston Villa, he was soon tipped for the international stage but injuries and instability at his club interfered. Having finally made the step, his exuberance was perhaps understandable. Delph continued to hurtle into challenges, ever keen to launch into a slide tackle. Hodgson must have toyed with the idea of an early change, but eventually Delph settled down and so did England. It might have happened sooner had the team taken one of its early chances and soothed the nerves before the first of Daniel Welbeck’s goals. By the end, he seemed entirely at home. There was no suggestion of him coming off as Hodgson made changes. He ran for miles and made contributions in both penalty boxes. There was a good block to deny Granit Xhaka and a good shout for a penalty, 10 minutes from time. In a department where England are painfully thin, here was a big bonus for Hodgson.","Delph made his competitive England debut after pulling on the Three Lions for the first time against Norway last week .

"John Terry might have fleetingly wondered if he was on the right plane as he jetted back from a European night in Portugal without Frank Lampard next to him. Lampard, his travelling companion for 13 years, was making his way home from Manchester’s Etihad Stadium as, by chance, was Ashley Cole, in a reminder of a summer of accelerated change at Chelsea. Didier Drogba was injured, Petr Cech among the substitutes, John Mikel Obi came on but Terry was in his usual place, in the centre of Chelsea’s defence, celebrating his own Champions League ton by beating Sporting Lisbon thanks to Nemanja Matic’s first-half header. John Terry became only the sixth Englishman to reach 100 Champions League appearances . It did not always seem likely but he is the last of the old guard, the only survivor from the original Jose Mourinho team to be integral to the new-build project. And he detects signs of progress and medals ahead. ‘The most important thing is not the 100 appearances but to strive to go on and win the Champions League again,’ said Terry. ‘That’s the target of the club, the mentality of where we are as a club and has been for the last 10 years, since the owner came in. With Mourinho back in, that’s our target and that’s the standard. When Chelsea lost in the semi-final last season, there were tears from Terry. To some it was a sign he was on his way out of the club he joined from school. Like Cole and Lampard, his contract was up but, as they were allowed to leave, he signed again. David Luiz was sold to Paris Saint-Germain as Mourinho backed his 33-year-old skipper to be the solid base of a team he is creating to challenge for titles on all fronts. Terry (left) captained Chelsea in their 1-0 win at the Estadio Jose Alvalade on Tuesday night . Terry made his Champions League debut against MSK Zilina in 2003 . ‘I’ve fought off the competition. It’s what I’m hungry to do,’ said Terry. ‘I just want to win trophies. It’s what I’m born to do. It’s in me from when I was a kid. ‘I was in tears over the Premier League last year, behind closed doors, over throwing it away. Emotions are what I play for, week in, week out. I’m never scared to show them.’ He has a winner’s medal but Europe’s top competition has not always been kind to Terry. He missed the decisive penalty in the 2008 final shoot-out and when Chelsea did triumph, four years later, he was suspended as punishment for kicking Alexis Sanchez, a player he will face again for Arsenal on Sunday. ‘Of course, it was the biggest night ever for the club and I didn’t play,’ said Terry. ‘But I played in one and I felt a massive part of it and the players made me feel a huge part of it. You look back at games like Napoli and others along the way where you played a big part. ‘Because it’s me, people say: “He’s not won it”. People like to have their digs and their pops, but I know I played a huge part along the way, in the dressing room and on the field.

Terry took his wife out shopping the day after Chelsea's 1-0 Champions League win at Sporting Lisbon . The married couple appeared to enjoy themselves during their shopping trip out in London . The pair spent so much in the store that they needed help with their bags from staff as they left the building . ‘I count myself to have won it. No one speaks about the other 10 players who weren’t on the pitch that night. Maybe that’s me and where I’m at as a player.’ It has been a turbulent career, with scandals on and off the pitch, but Terry seems to have quelled the storm, helped by the return of Mourinho, who values his leadership qualities and plays a tactical style that suits him. The niggling injury problems which played a part as he slipped to fourth-choice centre-half under Rafa Benitez two years ago have eased and the captain stands as an example to the new guard: Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa and Nemanja Matic. ‘They’re unbelievable players and big characters on and off the pitch,’ said Terry. ‘They’re what I call real men. Matic came back from Portugal a completely different player and a man. ‘Cesc has been here before, so he knew what to expect. With Diego we didn’t know. Some strikers take months but he’s hit the ground running with eight goals already.’","John Terry captained Chelsea in their 1-0 Champions League win at Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday night .

"Jose Mourinho took a swipe at Manchester City as Chelsea prepared for their trip to the Etihad Stadium, claiming UEFA must take points and titles from clubs who fail to comply with Financial Fair Play. The Chelsea boss said it would be a fairer punishment than the fines and squad restrictions which City have faced this year. ‘Everybody knows there are fines and, if these fines exist, control exists,’ said Mourinho, in an interview with Portuguese broadcasters TVI. ‘But are fines fair? I don’t think so. In my opinion the first thing is to remove points and remove titles. Jose Mourinho claims clubs who fail to comply with FFP should be thrown out of the Champions League . James Milner and Martin Demichelis tackle Arjen Robben during Manchester City's defeat at Bayern Munich . Chelsea have been unashamedly bankrolled by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich . ‘If you have important capital which allows you to overcome the FFP; if you win titles and then you are fined economically, you keep doing the same thing.’ Mourinho added with a shrug: ‘They will take from you one or two players from the Champions League list. Then, instead of 24, you go with 22. But if you’re stating that you will start the next Champions League with six points fewer, or you won’t play in the next edition of the Champions League and go into the Europa League instead, it’s more serious.’ UEFA punished City, Paris Saint-German and Zenit St Petersburg this year for breaking FFP rules. City were fined £50million — though this will be reduced if they comply in future — and they had their squad for this year’s Champions League campaign cut to 21 players. After years of huge cash losses, Chelsea worked hard to comply with FFP and this week, chief executive Ron Gourlay admitted the club had changed its policy from the days when they were unashamedly bankrolled by Roman Abramovich. Gourlay says they now have to ‘chase the penny’.

"Arsene Wenger insists the quality of Mesut Ozil is more evident when he is back home, studying the game for a second time, while others at Arsenal are generating football which inspires love at first sight. Alexis Sanchez swept in a majestic volley - his third important goal in as many games - and Danny Welbeck left a positive impression on his debut, while Jack Wilshere lifted the crowd and infected his team-mates with his aggression and desire during Saturday's 2-2 draw against Manchester City. It was arguably Wilshere's most influential performance in an Arsenal shirt since his serious ankle injuries, topped with his first goal since January, a deft chip to fool Joe Hart, and an assist for Sanchez. Alexis Sanchez thought he scored the winning goal until Martin Demichelis' late goal . Danny Welbeck missed a golden chance to open his Arsenal account on his debut . Danny Welbeck is the third PL player to play for Arsenal and Man Utd after Mikael Silvestre and Robin van Persie. 'He has found his pace back,' said Wenger. 'That for a while was not the case. He finished with his right foot and chipped a goalkeeper who knows him well. For a long time, he did not kick the ball well because of his ankle. 'Now in training, he kicks the ball well and works on his finishing. His shot with his ankle is now clean again. He has found power back. He stays on his feet, which is the big difference. When he was not as confident, he would push on his ankle and go down on his body. He is more solid.' It will not have been lost on Wilshere that Paul Scholes, one of his arch-critics, was pitch-side as a BT Sport pundit. 'You cannot explain his performance by the criticism of Paul Scholes, but you have to respond to your critics in a public job,' said Wenger. One good game will not end the scrutiny. Arsenal and England will demand this form consistently, even if they are to play him in different roles. Wenger does not want to lose his 'penetrative qualities' by deploying him deep, as Roy Hodgson did in Switzerland last week. Sergio Aguero opened the scoring for Manchester City in a classic breakaway goal on Saturday . The deeper role is unnatural for Wilshere, who is more at ease bursting onto the game, exploding past opponents, threading passes and, hopefully, threatening to goal. 'In the formation we play I should be scoring more,' said Wilshere. 'I've had a few chances this season. Hopefully that will be one of many. I want to go forward more. You saw with England, sometimes I lost a bit of concentration. I'm happy to play either.' Ultimately, his efforts could not produce more than a point for his team. It was a third successive draw in the Barclays Premier League for Arsenal. Like City, they are stuttering, spilling points as pacesetters Chelsea gallop on. Aaron Ramsey is not in the fluent groove he was and the wonderfully-gifted Ozil flickers around the game's fringes, irritating fans with his languid manner, having been forced wide on the left in Wenger's new formation. Jack Wilshere levelled the scoring in the second half after lobbing England team-mate Joe Hart . Jack Wilshere scored a neat chip past Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart in the 63rd minute . 'People will always have this kind of attitude about him,' said Wenger. 'He worked hard and played quite well. You always see a good Ozil when you watch the game again. Then you realise his timing and his quality of the pass. 'Sometimes you can be frustrated during the game but you must not over-react. When you watch the game in a cool manner again, you see what a good player he is.' City are more physical, more mature and more complete than Arsenal. Wenger will be encouraged by team's determination to resist and their refusal to accept the inevitable slide towards a negative result when things started conspire against them. 'They have definitely made progress,' said Vincent Kompany, as he agreed the Londoners looked 'a better side' than last season. 'We're forcing it a bit more,' said Wilshere. 'We're not accepting it. We're not just letting them play when we lose the ball. We want to win it back. That first five seconds is so important if you want to win the ball back. 'Towards the end of last season when it looked like we wouldn't get into the top four, we sat down and said: Listen, this isn't good enough. Since the last seven or eight games of last season until now, we've had a fantastic attitude. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will be pleased with his side's second half display . 'Everyone in training is buying into the defensive side of the game and we want to improve that, winning the ball back high up. Once we do that, our quality is going to change.' Wenger will require this fighting spirit because bare patches are already appearing in his defensive cover after right-back Mathieu Debuchy damaged ligaments in his right-ankle after catching his studs in the turf. Debuchy is expected to be out for two months, which will bring Calum Chambers, the only back-up centre-half, in at right-back. Other defenders in the senior squad are left-back Kieran Gibbs, just back from injury, and 19-year-old right-back Hector Bellerin, yet to make a competitive start for Arsenal. Wenger admitted Debuchy's injury, in the 81st minute, hurt his team. 'We just switched off,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We did not look the same team. Not because of Chambers but we looked a bit lost.' Another test awaits against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday while City are also bound for Germany to face Bayern Munich, where they won last year but fell one goal short of winning the group. 'This is an away game against one of the hardest teams to play in the world right now,' said Kompany. 'But we should take confidence out of the last game we played in Munich.'

"If home really is where the heart is then Tugay Kerimoglu can prepare to be confused as Arsenal attempt to get their European campaign back on track at home to Galatasaray on Wednesday. For 14 years, Tugay prowled midfield for Galatasaray, the club he supported as a boy, and he has returned to Istanbul to coach them twice, as assistant manager to Gheorghe Hagi and again in the same role for Roberto Mancini. He and Mancini left in May after winning the Turkish Cup and finishing second in the league. Tugay is now living in his London apartment at what was once Highbury Stadium while considering his next move. Tugay Kerimoglu has great experience of both the Premier League and Turkey's Super Lig . Tugay spent last season working as Roberto Mancini's (L) assistant coach at Galatasaray . The former midfielder has warned that Galatasaray fans' passion can be scary . He is certain about one thing. ‘No more assistant,’ said Tugay, a rugged figure in double-denim with his grey hair swept back to his collar as it was when he played. He is ready to manage. ‘The stress doesn’t matter,’ the 44-year-old added. ‘It’s part of football. I learned that you have to confront it if you’re to be successful. ‘I listened to my managers taken something from them all: Mark Hughes, Graeme Souness, Fatih Terim; all different approaches. It all comes to this point. ‘I worked closely for eight months with Roberto Mancini. By the end of the season we had the team settled and looking good but you never know what is going to happen.’ Tugay began is career with boyhood club Galatasaray in 1987 . Former Galatasaray manager Graeme Souness instructs Tugay to let others do the running . Except, at Galatasaray you can have a good guess if you finish one place behind Fenerbahce, their fierce rivals from the Asian side of the Bosphorus. ‘The club has no patience,’ said Tugay. ‘In Turkey, you have to win the title every year. That is the only measure of success. In England, it is more about what the manager thinks; his philosophy. ‘I remember at Blackburn once, we lost 10 games at home in a season and there was no-one calling for the manager to be sacked. In Turkey it is all about the scoreboard. It’s a cultural thing. In Turkey, we think with our hearts.’ Tugay has never been one to talk much, preferring to go about his business on the field, but he has seen fiery moments when the passions of British and Turkish football mixed. He saw Souness plant an enormous red-and-gold flag in the centre circle at Fenerbahce’s Sukru Saracoglu stadium after Galatasaray had beaten their rivals to win the Turkish Cup in 1996. ‘He knew what that derby meant,’ said Tugay. Galatasaray fans create an intimidating atmosphere during a game against fierce rivals Fenerbahce . Souness almost caused a riot after planting a Galatasaray flag on the pitch after Turkish Cup win in 1996 . ‘It is one of the biggest rivalries in the world and it doesn’t stop at the stadium gates. I don’t know what went through his head, but now it’s part of the history of the club. In Turkey, we can’t bear losing. Sometimes things go wrong because there’s so much passion. It’s how we’re brought up.’ Tugay was reared at the old Ali Sami Yen Stadium. It was demolished in 2010 as Galatasaray moved to the Turk Telekom Arena. The new place is nearly twice as big, but memories of the intimidating atmosphere at the old ground still send a tingle down the spine. ‘It was special,’ said Tugay. ‘The hairs would stand up on your arms. It was an atmosphere completely different to anywhere else. The new stadium looks like the Emirates, but the fans are the same and they still get behind their team, always.’ He was playing for Galatasaray in the infamous 0-0 draw in 1993 which knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League on away goals. United’s players claimed they were attacked by riot police sent to shield them from fans who lit flares and hurled missiles. ‘The police went to protect them, not to do harm,’ said Tugay and believes that victory was crucial to the development of the team — and Turkish football. ‘United were a big club, with big history. No-one gave us a chance. I remember reports afterwards about how United’s shares had gone down — the result caused financial damage.’ Tugay faced his former club Galatasaray in the Champions League after moving to Glasgow Rangers in 1999 . The Turkish midfielder enjoyed a successful career playing in the Premier League with Blackburn 2001-09 . Tugay tastes a typical Paul Scholes' challenge while playing for Turkey against England . Souness, in charge at Galatasaray for the 1995-96 campaign, regrets missing the chance to develop Tugay’s generation. It would evolve to beat Arsenal in the UEFA Cup final in 2000 — although Tugay had joined Rangers by then — and many of those players formed the nucleus of the Turkey team that reached the 2002 World Cup semi-finals. ‘If you ask for my favourite memory it is always the World Cup,’ said Tugay. ‘To come so close was spectacular.’ When Turkey met England in the qualifiers for Euro 2004, it was another tense affair with players clashing in the tunnel after Tugay conceded a first-half penalty, which was missed by David Beckham. By this time, after 18 months at Ibrox, Tugay was at Blackburn, again with Souness, who also signed Hakan Sukur, another Galatasaray star. Homesick Hakan was soon back in Istanbul, but Tugay spent eight years in East Lancashire with wife Etkin and their two children. His football thrived in England with his understanding of the shape of the game around him and ability to control it. ‘When I moved to Blackburn, Souness told me to play simple and let everybody else do the running,’ he said. ‘Maybe this is why I stayed so long — but it was always one of my aims to be a manager.’ Tugay takes a walk with his daughter to thank Blackburn fans after playing his final game for the club . Gheorghe Hagi (L), pictured here for Galatasaray against Leeds, was the best player Tugay ever played with . Bayern Munich coach and former Barcelona midfielder Pep Guardiola was Tugay's role model as a player . Tugay played until he was 38 and won 94 caps. When asked for the best he played with, he mentions Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke before settling on Romanian maestro Hagi. ‘He was a great person who never once hid behind his name,’ he said. When Tugay quit playing in 2009, Hughes gave him a coaching role at Manchester City’s academy. Since then, he has coached in Turkey’s national academy as well as at Galatasaray. If his next job is in Britain, he will be delighted. He holds a British passport and 19-year-old son Berke studies in London and daughter Melis, 11, was born in the city. As a player, he always sought to model his style on Pep Guardiola. ‘How he ran, where he ran, the spaces he played in,’ said Tugay. ‘He played like a man with four eyes.’ If he emulates Guardiola’s coaching career as successfully as he did his playing style, this could be the start of something big.","Arsenal face Galatasaray in Champions League clash on Wednesday .

"If all hope for the future of this England team revolves around Raheem Sterling, perhaps it’s best if the whole team revolves around him, too. Roy Hodgson is a careful man and can be expected to resist the urge to pile greater responsibility on to a 19-year-old with eight caps. He is also an experienced coach with an expert eye which must be telling him that Sterling is developing at an accelerated rate into an exceptional attacking force. Hodgson will cogitate, for sure, but for anyone watching England toil to a 1-0 win against Norway at Wembley on Wednesday it was clear the Liverpool starlet is the team’s most exciting and threatening player. Flying start: Raheem Sterling has impressed for Liverpool and England in his fledging career so far . With his turbo speed and ability to jink past an opponent in a heartbeat, a brief moment from Sterling can destroy the most meticulous defensive planning. In a world where even ordinary teams are fit and well-drilled, his unpredictability is priceless. Hodgson is not blind to this, which is why he fast-tracked Sterling ahead of the World Cup. He also knows he is most lethal when used centrally, which is why he played him in the central role against Italy in Manaus. If he gets on the ball and jinks instinctively past the first man, he will be attacking the centre halves, in front of goal, able to dart either way going into the penalty box, daring defenders to make the tackle and concede a penalty, or a free-kick in range of goal. Star man: Sterling has become an integral attacking player for his club Liverpool and for England . Out wide, he can still wreak havoc, but there is more chance he will run into cover, or be smothered or forced into a corner. And the free-kicks he wins out wide are not likely to result in direct efforts on goal. He is not only a dribbler. He is aware of others and links up with them. He can slide a pass. Sterling in the centre makes sense. The big problem is, of course, that it threatens the captain. To free Sterling is to shackle Wayne Rooney, at least to some extent. England cannot afford to jettison someone of Rooney’s calibre at a time when they are desperately short of players, let alone those of rare quality and experience. Hodgson, having made Rooney his captain, must find a way to keep him in, while making Sterling more integral. The starting point may be the shape which finished the friendly against Norway, with Sterling at the top of a midfield diamond behind two strikers. Shackled: Moving Sterling to a central role for England could effect the role of captain Wayne Rooney in the side . It will be a system unfamiliar to anyone not from Liverpool but they are intelligent enough to learn if Hodgson puts the right players in the right areas, and he insists finding round pegs for round holes is one of his strengths. As it stands, it would be a pick of two from Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck. The most obvious flaw to the plan is the absence of a natural holding midfielder with a defensive instinct, especially if full-backs are expected to provide attacking width. Hodgson will watch closely how Chelsea’s Nathaniel Chalobah develops on loan at Burnley this season, and if Calum Chambers is used in this role at Arsenal. Much promise: England manager Roy Hodgson will want Raheem Sterling to continue his fine progress . Aside from this, the manager must experiment until he finds the balance. There can be no better environment to find a solution than a lame qualifying campaign with safety nets at every turn. Sterling is raw and makes mistakes. There was the red card against Ecuador in Miami, for instance. He will frustrate his manager, his team-mates and fans as he progresses. ‘It doesn’t always come off but he’s an exciting player,’ said Rooney as everyone else gushed uncontrollably after the Norway game. This tame campaign is a gift for Hodgson. It is the perfect place for Sterling to learn about international football before launching into Euro 2016 at the age of 21, and for England to learn more about him and discover the best way to maximise this special talent.","At just 19 Raheem Sterling is an integral player for Liverpool and England .

"A record low attendance at the new Wembley could greet England against Norway on Wednesday night, but the game has plenty to offer. It is the first time the Three Lions have played since the World Cup in Brazil, with Roy Hodgson keen to spark a revival. And that's not all. Here are three reasons why you should be watching the game. Thinking time: Roy Hodgson and England are preparing for the test Norway will present at Wembley Stadium . WAYNE ROONEY . It will be the first game in his official role as captain and Rooney will win his 96th England cap. The best player of his generation will lead the new era. He is on course to win his 100th cap against Slovenia at the age of 29. Fresh start: Wayne Rooney is the new captain of England and will hope to impress on his 96th appearance . RAHEEM STERLING . Raised in the shadow of Wembley Stadium, Sterling has emerged as one of the brightest and most exciting talents in European football in the last 12 months, on an accelerated development curve. He is the gem Hodgson’s new team must be designed to showcase. England's gem: Raheem Sterling had a fine World Cup and is Hodgson's main hope . A NEW BEGINNING . Jack Colback is injured but there may be first caps for Danny Rose, Fabian Delph and Calum Chambers and one of these opportunities might just be the start of something new and exciting. New beginning: Jack Colback (centre) is injured but Fabian Delph (left) and Danny Rose (right) could feature .","England play Norway at Wembley on Wednesday night .

"After the Golden Generation comes England’s new Jilted Generation. Disowned by the paying public at Wembley on Wednesday night and increasingly unwanted by the biggest clubs in the transfer market. Almost 40,000 are expected at Wembley, itself something of a triumph for the marketing department considering England’s uninspiring performances in Brazil. Roy Hodgson claimed ticket sales may have been hit by the start of the school year but, in fairness, this seemed unlikely. Tough job: Roy Hodgson must try to excite the English public again against Norway on Wednesday night . Lack of interest: Around 40,000 fans, less than half the capacity, are expected to be in attendance . Tough to watch: England were knocked out of the World Cup without winning a game in Brazil . It’s hard to imagine the armchair audience voting in their millions by snubbing The Great British Bake Off for a friendly against Norway, in preparation for a Euro 2016 qualifying campaign so simple that England cannot fail to make it to the finals in France. The general lack of interest is a direct result of finishing on the soggy bottom of a World Cup group won by Costa Rica, and the feeling of apathy is more dangerous for the Football Association than one of anger which has taken hold in the past, when the nation expected more of its team. Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole have gone, taking with them 300-plus caps of experience and the last vestiges of a seam of talent so rich it forced England to believe and then blush with embarrassment when they did not deliver. Meanwhile, those chosen to represent the future have problems of their own, such as how to get a game in the Champions League. The bulk of the £800million spent by Barclays Premier League clubs went on foreign players and while Hodgson complains about ‘blocked pathways’ he knows there is little he can do to reverse the trend other than offer a few words of encouragement to the young players who will form the basis of his rebuilding operation. ‘I’m loath to talk about eras,’ he said. ‘It’s more a question of keeping things moving forward.’ But this represents ground zero as he starts the process of engaging a nation of 50 million and rewarding those loyal fans who stood to applaud a goalless draw against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte. He can barely afford another backward step. Monday’s Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland is the toughest game of the campaign and he cannot surrender the initiative by losing the opening fixture. Not just a friendly: Hodgson can barely afford a backwards step as he looks to engage a nation . Big chance: Wayne Rooney captains the side on Wednesday night and will hope to lead them to Euro 2016 . In form: Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling have been in fine form for Liverpool so far this season . Hodgson said all the things you might expect to lift the mood, as did his new skipper Wayne Rooney, even though Manchester United’s swoop for Radamel Falcao raises questions about his future role in Louis van Gaal’s team. If it was down to former England and United defender Paul Parker, he would be the next forced to the fringes once occupied by Daniel Welbeck and now featuring Tom Cleverley. ‘It’s the cleft-stick situation,’ said Hodgson, as he explained why good English players are wanted at the big clubs, but might not be good enough to play every week. James Milner finds himself in this cleft at Manchester City. Jack Rodwell has escaped it. Joe Hart seems to exist one bad patch of form away from it. ‘I certainly feel I’m capable of dropping back and I’m sure one day I will,’ said Rooney when asked if he might become a midfielder, but for now the United striker will lead England from the front, in every sense. ‘I’ve always said I don’t want to finish my career with England having not won anything,’ said Rooney. ‘I’ve always wanted to win a trophy with England, and if I can lead us to do that, that’ll be the pinnacle of my career. ‘That will be very difficult, but I really do think it’s achievable. Look at the players we’ve got. They’re exciting players. They have to do what they do for their clubs with England, and we have to bring that together. That has to be our aim.’ Trophy hunter: Rooney insists he is still eager to win a trophy with England... perhaps as a midfielder . United group: Rooney has promised to be 'vocal' and 'demanding' as captain of the Three Lions . As a captain, he promised to be ‘vocal’ and ‘demanding’. ‘I’m harsh on myself and harsh on my team-mates,’ he added, and did not seem bothered to hear Norway’s Vegard Forren had called him ‘chubby’. ‘To be honest, I’m not too interested,’ shrugged Rooney, who will win his 96th cap, before Hodgson noted: ‘Wayne’s in fantastic physical condition.’ Elsewhere there are good English players defying the system, of course. There is perhaps no more exciting talent in the Premier League than Raheem Sterling, who will start against Norway as Hodgson goes for energy and pace on the flanks in something of a return to his beloved 4-4-2 formation. ‘I don’t need to get hung up as to whether it’s the buzz formation of the moment,’ said Hodgson. ‘We don’t intend to go down the road of three at the back at the moment, because we have players perfectly suited to playing in a four.’ Now's your chance: Hodgson admitted it was time for Jack Wilshere to step up as an England midfielder . Up front, he will hope Rooney and Daniel Sturridge gel more successfully than they have to date, while in central defence he will explore a partnership of Phil Jones and Gary Cahill. One of them, probably Cahill, the second most capped outfield player in this side, must start to command at the back, but it is in central midfield where Hodgson will be desperate for signs of encouragement from Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson. Without Gerrard and Lampard, the dearth of options is underlined by the fact the next cabs in the rank are Jack Colback and Fabian Delph. ‘Most people have been thinking this could be the chance for Jack Wilshere,’ said Hodgson. ‘I believe that too. This is his chance. I hope he and Jordan can do well together. It’s important for them to develop a relationship.’","Almost 40,000 are expected at Wembley, less than half the capacity .

"Day One: Manchester United sign Radamel Falcao, one of the world’s most potent centre-forwards, in a deal worth so many millions nobody seems quite sure exactly how many, but everyone agrees he will play up front. Day Two: Former England and United defender Paul Parker pipes up in an online blog to brand him “awful”, criticise the size of his salary and demand he is dropped, while Southampton reject and Norway defender Vegard Forren calls him “chubby” in an interview on Norwegian TV. Day Three: Marks his first game as the official captain of the team with a dour and low-key friendly against Norway in front of the smallest crowd ever to witness an England international at the new Wembley Stadium. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson: Wayne Rooney knows he can play better . Captain's call: Wayne Rooney scored a penalty on his first appearance since taking over as England skipper . Backs turned: Rooney and his team-mates were watched by a record-low crowd at the new Wembley Stadium . Wayne Rooney’s first three days as captain of England weren’t going according to plan, until the 68th minute when he buried the penalty which gave his team the lead. He punched the air with the sort of ferocity he might have reserved for Parker or Forren and that was that. Off he went, hopeful that here was a goal to end the idea that the captain’s armband has carried with it a mild curse since David Beckham passed on the responsibility. There was Steven Gerrard’s miscued header in Sao Paulo, Rio Ferdinand’s knee injury in South Africa and John Terry’s… Well, there was John Terry. If week two starts in the same way for Rooney in Switzerland, England will be in real trouble. Roy Hodgson cannot contemplate defeat in Basle on Monday. Not because it will ruin their chances of qualification. It won’t. There’s no way England can fail to reach the finals in France in 2016, but this team is in desperate need of signs of encouragement to be sure they are to rebuild with any confidence after the World Cup debacle and the new skipper is to achieve the place in history he craves. Predecessor: Sven Goran Erikkson with Steven Gerrard after handing him the captain's armband in 2004 . Unlucky: The captain’s armband has carried with it a curse since David Beckham passed on the responsibility . Off the field, Rooney had performed his captaincy duties well. He stood at the front of the line, sang the anthem, swapped the mini-flags without trouble and witnessed the coin tossing ceremony. No sweat. He had been relaxed and good humoured as he joined Hodgson for a press conference on the eve of the game, wise-cracking about the manager’s physical condition. Wazza resisted the urge to respond to Forren’s remarks like Gazza once did, with a four-letter message to the people of Norway. Forren, a Southampton reject, who signed for the Saints and returned across the North Sea without appearing for a single second, would no doubt have his comeuppance on the pitch. Except he didn’t. On the field, it all seemed a little more arduous. This remember is Rooney’s natural habitat. He is a playground player. All the pomp and ceremony is not his cup of tea, but let him loose with a ball and watch him go. If only. Early on, he misplaced passes and his touch was heavy, while his partnership with Daniel Sturridge has still to click. Some strikers seem to have a telepathic connection. Some do not. Although that is not necessarily Rooney’s fault. Leading from the front: Rooney emerges from the dressing room with his team-mates ahead of kick off . Frustration: England were held for much of the game and struggled to break through Noway's defence . The chemistry between them best summed up when Sturridge, looking to take a free-kick quickly having been fouled in the centre of the pitch, thought he had seen a Rooney run and clipped a pass over the Norway defence. The trouble was there was no run. Rooney had barely moved. It was more of the maddening frustration witnessed in the World Cup. Rooney’s best work came when he dropped deeper, turning on the ball in midfield and launching long passes. He appreciates the angles of the game when tucks into those areas. He tried to make things happen in a game which threatened to seize up at times. He remains a good player, but he is less often these days one who can inspire. England had the best of the early chances but it was Raheem Sterling, dashing inside from the left who lifted the supporters from their slumber. Backwards step: Rooney’s best work came when he dropped deeper towards midfield . In Switzerland, England could find themselves over-run if they go there with two zippy wingers and two strikers. Rooney’s role is the one which will have to be refined. There was a goal, there was a win but there was no end to the concern.

"When Radamel Falcao left for Manchester in such a dreadful hurry this week, it was almost enough to make the residents of Monaco choke on their lobster risotto, drop their flute of fizz, rip the Gucci shades from their eyes and demand answers. Almost, but not quite. Monaco is a strange place. For many locals it will have passed without notice that the rest of European football has turned with intrigue towards the principality and events at the club owned by Dmitry Rybolovlev. Was it a cash-flow issue that forced the Russian oligarch to cool on his investment and sell star assets Falcao and James Rodriguez as they prepared for a return to the Champions League for the first time in nearly a decade? That would be understandable as he fights an astonishing divorce settlement of £2.7billion. On his way out: Radamel Falcao has been loaned out by Monaco to Manchester United for a £6m fee . Star striker: Falcao was Monaco's poster boy and main source of goals . Or was he simply getting bored? Was it a whim? Had he taken offence that his desire for full citizenship has yet to be granted? Was it something more sinister? Was Monte Carlo going bust? Monaco's manager Leonardo Jardim quietly fumed. This was not what the brochure had promised when he replaced Claudio Ranieri in June. Fans demanded refunds on shirts and season tickets bought before the exodus of players and change of recruitment policy. Monaco reneged on a pre-contract deal to sign Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes and took Maarten Stekelenburg on loan from Fulham instead. Months after reports of an audacious plot to sign Cristiano Ronaldo, the targets look very different. Joao Moutinho, who arrived with James from Porto last year in a £60million package, was rumoured to have stormed out of the training ground when it became clear Falcao was off to Manchester United, irrespective of the fact the Colombian's commitment has been in question since his return from serious injury. Elsewhere, around France, there was a sigh of disappointment that the only true challengers to unfeasibly rich champions Paris Saint-Germain had chosen to scale back and leave Ligue 1 hopelessly uncompetitive. All smiles: Falcao with United assistant manager after signing for the season at Old Trafford . Expensive: Dmitri Rybolovley is going through an eye-watering £2.7m divorce with wife Elena . Jardim's team have four points from four games and their quest for a first French title since 2000 appears fanciful. Loyal supporters feel betrayed and angry, but these feelings will not reverberate in the streets as they might if this script had unfolded down the coast in Marseille. Resident millionaires — tennis players, racing drivers, actors, music stars and the like — have higher profiles than the footballers in a town busily preparing for its annual yacht show. What do they care if Falcao deserts them to rub shoulders with skinny wannabes from Coronation Street and Hollyoaks or fading rebels from the Happy Mondays? AS Monaco has always been quite unique, a football club set in a tax haven of 36,000 people, the world's second smallest independent state, participating in the French league before crowds averaging 11,000 on a poor pitch built on a car park. The appeal has never been its passion for football. 'I was young and I enjoyed it for a while,' said former England striker Mark Hateley, who spent three years there, after moving from AC Milan in 1987. 'It was completely different from the intensity of Milan. I could walk in the streets with my kids and there was no fuss. We were playing good football in a good team under a young Arsene Wenger. We were successful. We won the title and it was a great experience. 'The lifestyle is beautiful, but in the winter we could play in front of two or three thousand. For big players, it's not quite what you want. I left after three years. I needed new challenges. That's the downside. The upside, of course, for the big stars, is that it's tax free.' Also gone: James Rodriguez left Monaco for Real Madrid for £63m after a superb World Cup . Quietly fuming: This is not what new Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim expected when he took over . The principality ruled by the Grimaldi dynasty charges no income tax and its private banking industry has long been the focus of international concern. For five years until 2009, it was on an official blacklist of uncooperative tax havens, but has always denied running a regime tolerant to money laundering. Rybolovlev was already a resident in December 2011 when he bought 66.67 per cent of the crisis club wallowing near the bottom of Ligue 2, having slumped from its high of the Champions League final in 2004. Head of state Prince Albert II applauded the deal. 'The agreement opens a new page in the history of the football team so dear to the principality,' said the Prince. 'I hope the club can rediscover its former prestige, which made it one of the jewels of Monaco's sporting life.' Others wondered aloud if this sugar-daddy takeover could work in the absence of a genuine fan-base, with UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules swinging into action. Would it soar like Chelsea, or crash like the failed experiment at Anzhi Makhachkala? Rybolovlev's personal fortune built on potash offered its own insurance. It was estimated by Forbes this year at £5.3bn and he remains seriously rich, even after his costly divorce. Within 18 months of the takeover Monaco were back in the top flight and assembling a formidable squad. They finished runners-up behind PSG last season, but the plans were already starting to unravel. After Falcao's exit on Monday, the club's vice-president Vadim Vasilyev stressed it had never been the plan to continue last year's spree, but he admitted three factors had forced the Russians to 'edit the project'. Royal assent: Prince Albert (right) was enthusistic when Rybolovley took over as owner of Monaco . No cashing in: Revenue did not explode at Monaco after the signings of Falcao and Rodriguez . Firstly, he said, there was FFP and the penalties imposed by UEFA on Manchester City and PSG for failing to comply. Then, there was the £41.5m paid to the French league to settle a dispute and allow AS Monaco to continue trading from their tax-free state while competing against clubs bound by France's taxation laws. 'They have always been a thorn in French football,' said Hateley. Rival clubs finally demanded action when France proposed a 75 per cent top-rate of income tax and a compromise was found, which included this one-off payment by Monaco. Initially the principality was going to pay half, but Rybolovlev has ended up footing the bill. Thirdly, revenue did not explode as hoped after big names such as Falcao, James, Moutinho, Jeremy Toulalan, Ricardo Carvalho and Eric Abidal arrived. 'We thought that with the stars we signed, sponsors would come,' said Vasilyev, in an interview with L'Equipe. 'We have realised that will take time.' Rybolovlev insists his divorce will not influence club policy. A Swiss court ordered him to pay £2.7bn, plus property in Switzerland worth £88.5m, to wife Elena after more than 20 years of marriage. Her lawyer called it 'the most expensive divorce in history,' although how much of the figure she actually receives is open to question. He has challenged the ruling and a complicated trust structure transfering assets to the couple's two daughters were not part of the ruling and the actual settlement is set to be the subject to ongoing legal action for many years. Some suspect this has influenced his club policy, while others think he has taken offence because his rescue act at AS Monaco has not been rewarded with the ultimate social upgrade from his carte de sejour — a 10-year residency pass — to a full Monegasque passport. Complicated: The deal to take Joao Moutinho (left) to Monaco was tangled up in third-party ownership . Only the Prince can grant full citizenship and very few of these passports exist (an estimated 6,000 in 2009). It is a matter of acceptance and his relationship with the royal family is thought to be crumbling. Prince Albert left early as Monaco lost their opening game of the season at home to Lorient — an act widely interpreted as a protest at Rybolovlev's failure to reinvest profits from James's £71m sale back into the team. It is not quite so simple. The deals to bring Falcao, James and Moutinho to the Stade Louis II were entangled with third-party ownership and as such the profits were not all for the club. Even so, there is no hint Rybolovlev is about to quit. He has just bought a new £180m apartment overlooking the harbour, the latest addition to a property empire that includes a £56m pad in Central Park - bought by his daughter Ekaterina Rybolovleva - that broke New York real estate records. 'Who knows the future?' said Vasilyev in L'Equipe, but he insisted the owner will be back in his seat in the stands for the Champions League opener against Bayer Leverkusen on September 16, and remained ambitious and committed to an 'intelligent long-term project' albeit one that is slightly 'less glorious' than before. Vasilyev told the Daily Mail: 'Since becoming President of AS Monaco in 2011, Mr Rybolovlev has overseen the club's promotion to Ligue 1 and qualification for the Champions League – both achieved at the first attempt. He remains 100 percent committed to the AS Monaco project. 'In light of events over the past year that could not have been foreseen, some of the tactics and the timeframe for the project have been amended. But the ultimate goal remains exactly the same: to develop AS Monaco into a competitive European club and one of the world's elite sporting brands.'

"Toulouse won a closely-fought Champions Cup encounter against Montpellier 30-23 at the Stade Ernest-Wallon on Sunday. Tries from Yohan Huget (two) and Jean-Marc Doussain helped to secure victory for Toulouse, who face Bath at the Recreation Ground next Saturday in their second match of the competition. Toulouse fly-half Luke McAllister missed a penalty two minutes into the match but was on target from the tee nine minutes later to level after a Teddy Iribaren penalty had put Montpellier in front in the eighth minute. Yohan Huget crosses the line for one of his two tries as Toulouse made the perfect start to the tournament . French international Theirry Dusatoir hands the ball off to fly half Luke McAlister as Toulouse mount an attack . Montpellier winger Samisoni Viriviri had an impressive running try disallowed shortly after the half-hour mark, but the visitors did get the opening try moments later. Winger Timoci Nagusa strolled over unopposed down the blindside after a strong Montpellier scrum had left the Toulouse defence in tatters. Scum-half Iribaren added the conversion to make it 10-3 but Toulouse hit back immediately with a second McAllister penalty before they took the lead when Huget beat Viriviri to a grubber kick and dotted down. McAllister added the extras to give Toulouse a 13-10 lead at half-time. Former England No 10 Toby Flood came off the bench to kick some vital points as Toulouse held on to win .

Enzo Selponi, assuming the kicking duties in Iribaren's absence, nailed a difficult conversion to make the score 17-13. Their lead lasted just 60 seconds as Huget collected McAllister's crossfield kick to cross for his second try of the game and Toby Flood, on for Florian Fritz, added the extras as Toulouse went into a 20-17 lead. Jean-Marc Doussain dives over for Toulouse's third try which put his side back in the lead at 27-20 . Dusautoir congratulates his scrum-half on the all-important score, and Toulouse were able to hold on . Toulouse then found themselves a man down when replacement tighthead prop Census Johnston received a yellow card for taking out Nagusa. Iribaren returned to the action and drew Montpellier level with a 63rd-minute penalty but Toulouse led 27-20 when Flood converted Doussain's 66th-minute try, and the former Leicester man then stretched his side's lead to 10 points by kicking a 79th-minute penalty. Replacement fly-half Benoit Paillaugue booted a penalty in the final minute to earn a losing bonus point for Montpellier, but they ran out of time to get anything else from the match.","Yohan Huget scores two tries as Toulouse win cup opener .

"When Nathaniel Chalobah completed his four-month move to Burnley on Monday, it took the number of Chelsea players on loan at different clubs around the world to 22, the equivalent of two teams. Still they had not finished. Ulises Davila was later loaned to Tenerife in Spain’s second tier, Islam Feruz negotiated another to OFI Crete in Greece, Matej Delac went to French team Arles-Avignon and Jamal Blackman headed to Middlesbrough . That moved it on to 26, and still there was mystery around the future of Petr Cech, who has lost his place after a decade in the team.

Earlier in the day, Marco van Ginkel, signed last year for £8million from Vitesse Arnhem, moved for a year on loan to AC Milan, where he will join Fernando Torres. Chelsea this season will have around £100m worth of signings scattered around the world on loan, a figure distorted by Torres who is responsible for half of it after he agreed a switch to Milan for the final two years of his contract.

Another Hazard: Eden's brother Thorgan (left) is continuing to develop at Borussia Monchengladbach . Of the others, several were recruited as teenagers for seven-figure fees and are now generating profits for the club from substantial loan fees, which all helps balance the books in the money-sensitive era of UEFA’s Financial Fair Play. Chelsea always argue that player development is the driving force behind the loan policy — and it is true that Jose Mourinho has little faith in the current reserve and Under 21 environment to produce and improve players fit for the top end of the Barclays Premier League — but there is financial appeal, too. It has been a strong year for the number crunchers at Stamford Bridge with profits banked on Juan Mata, David Luiz, Romelu Lukaku and Kevin de Bruyne, which have funded Mourinho’s rebuilding programme. Waiting in the wings: Christian Atsu has had to move to Everton for a chance . Change of scenery: Tomas Kalas has switched to Cologne . Plenty keeping him out: Matej Delac (right) has gone to Aries-Avignon . Exactly how good the policy is for the well-being of the young players in question — or those from the club’s academy who find their paths blocked by teenage signings — is another matter but they are not breaking any rules, and Chelsea’s long-term aim is to reduce their overall squad of players. Today, with the market closed, they are the most extreme example but Manchester City are also in double figures for players out on loan. For those who failed to find a move on Monday night, the Football League’s ‘emergency’ loan window will be open for business next week.","Chelsea have 26 players loaned out across the globe .

"Tottenham's capitulations against the Barclays Premier League's best teams prompted Hugo Lloris to question the character of his team-mates, but he believes Mauricio Pochettino will help them kick the habit. Liverpool, who visit White Hart Lane on Sunday, fired nine past Spurs goalkeeper Lloris in two games last season while champions Manchester City scored 11. Those four hammerings – and a 4-0 defeat at Chelsea – helped get both Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood sacked, wrecked top four dreams and damaged the rebuilding process as the club tried to replace Gareth Bale with seven new players. Scroll down for video... Thumbs up! Hugo Lloris is confident that Mauricio Pochettino will help Tottenham beat the big teams . Hot Spur: Mauricio Pochettino is unbeaten in the Premier League ahead of Sunday's meeting with Liverpool . 'It broke our confidence,' said Lloris. 'When you lost once it can happen but when you lost against top teams twice, three times, four times it means there was something wrong in our side. 'When you're a player you're just thinking about the next game and you don't know what will happen. The more you win the better you feel. If you get a bad result you need to respond quickly next game with a victory. 'I have played a lot of important games and I have the faculty to switch from game to game but, collectively it is never easy to bounce back. This is why it's important always to believe in yourself, your teammates, your team, your club and the manager's philosophy to always try to keep in a good level. This is why we are working to find the best solution but always to improve as a team.' Lloris reached the point when he felt the urge to speak out. 'We have to show more character,' he said, in April. 'We sometimes had the feeling that we gave up.' Must do better: Tottenham conceded nine goals in two games against Liverpool during last season . Blue murder: Stevan Jovetic (L) scores one of the 11 goals Manchester City put past Spurs last season . With Paris St Germain interested, the France goalkeeper seemed ready to force a move but spoke to Daniel Levy before the World Cup and was convinced instead to sign a new five-year contract at Spurs and has been impressed with the early signs of life under Pochettino. He believes the Argentine is toughening Spurs up and demanding a greater commitment to his philosophy. 'It was not just a lack of character,' said Lloris. 'We are in the best league in the world and we have to play at a high level. For that we need to see all players involved, ready to play for the team and to think only about the team. 'We changed a lot of things. We have a new manager, with his own staff. We believe in his concept and his philosophy, and we are working every day to go in his way and to play as a team. We want to show everyone we have the potential to be a good team in the league.' Playing from the back: Hugo Lloris will be asked to perform a keeper-sweeper role under Mauricio Pochettino . Full makeover: Mauricio Pochettino oversees training as he continues to implement to his philosophy . For Lloris personally, the Pochettino way means more touches as a sweeper-keeper and fewer long balls launched from the back but he added: 'The most important thing is that everyone in the changing room believes in this philosophy. 'We need to keep working, keep the same spirit as we showed in the last few games and to have confidence in the changing room. You need to win, win, win. This is what we expect for this season.' Many of those signed last summer are more settled, which has helped Pochettino and, by a strange quirk, it is Liverpool who are working to help an array of summer signings gel after cashing in on Luis Suarez. Numbers game: Liverpool have tried to replace Luis Suarez (L) in a similar way that Spurs filled the void left by Gareth Bale (R) with a glut of new signings . 'When you have a lot of new players in the squad it is never easy for them to adapt,' said Lloris. 'You need time. England is maybe a bit different to other countries, with the characteristics of the Premier League and the intensity, the level of your opponents and it's always a tough game, so they need you to be fit, always.'

"Tottenham are desperate to offload some of their deadwood in order to revamp their squad on transfer deadline day. Mauricio Pochettino's squad is already two senior players over the Premier League's 25-man limit. Spurs are looking at last-minute deals for Danny Welbeck and Montpellier's defensive midfielder Benjamin Stambouli, but will have to sell or loan other players. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Top 10 Premier League transfers compilation . Future Spurs: Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is keen to sign Manchester United's Danny Welbeck . Done deal: Benjamin Stambouli is set to join Tottenham from Montpellier after passing his medical .

Two strikers: Adebayor and Soldado. That’s 27 senior players. Kane and Bentaleb don’t take a place in the Premier League squad as U21 players. Lewis Holtby could be one of the first out of the door with Hamburg set to secure the playmaker on a season-long loan deal and a permanent £6m deal could follow. The German side expect Holtby at the club for a medical later on Monday. Aaron Lennon and Sandro could also be on the way with fellow Londoners QPR - and former Spurs boss Harry Redknapp - interested in the duo. Redknapp is also set to sign young Tottenham left-back Zeki Fryers but he will have to fight off interest from Crystal Palace too. However Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is quoting a staggering £5m for out of favour left-back.

"The Welsh Rugby Union has paid tribute to former Scarlets chief executive Stuart Gallacher, who has died at the age of 68. Gallacher, a dual Wales international in rugby union and rugby league, was also the first chief executive of Regional Rugby Wales and served on the board of European Rugby Cup. A minute's silence was scheduled to take place during Sunday's WRU Annual General Meeting in Port Talbot. Stuart Gallacher died peacefully at the age of 68, having dedicated much of his life to Welsh rugby . WRU group chief executive Roger Lewis said: 'Stuart dedicated his life outside his family to the game of rugby, and his contribution down the years will prove a fitting epitaph to his commitment and loyalty. 'His understanding and love for the game meant he was always able to contribute positively to important decisions which formed the road map for the development of the sport.'

And WRU president Dennis Gethin added: 'Stuart was a close friend of so many people involved in Welsh rugby, and all of us are aware of his incredible contribution to our game.

"Former England midfielder Frank Lampard is likely to miss Manchester City's Champions League trip to CSKA Moscow next week with a thigh injury. The 36-year-old left the field on a stretcher after going down hurt during the first half of City's 4-1 Barclays Premier League win over Tottenham at the Etihad Stadium. Lampard will now have a scan to determine the seriousness of the problem but there seems little prospect of him being involved in Tuesday's Champions League Group E game in the Russian capital. Frank Lampard is set to miss Manchester City's Champions League game against CSKA Moscow . The midfielder was taken off on a stretcher during 4-1 victory against Tottenham with a thigh injury . Manager Manuel Pellegrini said: 'Frank has a muscle injury. We will see on Sunday after the scan but for the moment he will not travel to Russia.' Lampard, who was released by Chelsea at the end of last season, has made a big impression at City since joining the club on loan from sister club New York City.

"Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has dismissed speculation linking him with a move for Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling. The 19-year-old, who has risen to prominence for both the Reds and England in the last 12 months, is yet to agree a new deal at Anfield and there have been suggestions that Los Blancos were keen to lure him to Spain. But former Chelsea boss Ancelotti pointed out that they already have plenty to choose from in attacking areas so he sees no reason to sign Sterling, despite acknowledging his undoubted pedigree. Raheem Sterling, still only 19, has become a central figure for both Liverpool and England this season . 'Sterling is a player of great quality, certainly one of the best in Europe,' he told The Sun. 'But we already have extraordinary talent here.' Given Cristiano Ronaldo notched his 15th league goal in seven games as Real Madrid romped to a 5-0 win over Levante on Saturday it is easy to see why improvements in that area may not be a priority for Ancelotti - especially when he also has the likes of Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez, Karim Benzema and highly-rated youngster Jese. 'To think of another striker for the Real Madrid attack is really extremely difficult,' he added. 'It's clear that Sterling is not in our plans.' Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti said that, although Sterling is a great player, they have no plans to sign him . The 55-year-old Italian is set to get a much closer look at Sterling when his side travel to Merseyside to face Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday. Ancelotti has insisted that he will make no special plans to deal with the threat posed by Sterling because he instead prefers to focus on the danger posed by teams as a unit. But one player in the Liverpool ranks who may capture Ancelotti's imagination is Steven Gerrard after the Italian admitted he dreamt of pairing the former England captain with Andrea Pirlo during his time at the Rossoneri. Ancelotti said that with the attacking talent Real already have, it's difficult to imagine signing another forward . Ancelotti, who won the Champions League twice during his eight-year spell at Milan from 2001 to 2009, revealed that he made failed overtures to sign the 34-year-old. He said: 'We had sounded him out but Gerrard's bond with Liverpool was unbreakable. 'I don't remember exactly what year it was but we did try. Of course, I wanted to pair him up with Pirlo, it was a fantastic combination. Putting Gerrard in midfield with Pirlo. It would have been fantastic.' Ancelotti also revealed he tried to sign Steven Gerrard for AC Milan so he could pair him with Andrea Pirlo .","Carlo Ancelotti said he is not interested in signing Raheem Sterling .

"Midfielder Steven Davis expressed his determination for Southampton to keep progressing after committing his future to the south-coast club to summer 2018. There had been fears over how Saints would fare this term following a summer clear-out which saw several star players follow manager Mauricio Pochettino out of St Mary's. But, under the guidance of new boss Ronald Koeman, the team have flourished. And, having climbed to third in the Barclays Premier League, Davis insisted the Saints were not about to rest on their laurels. Steven Davis puts pen to paper on his new Southampton deal alongside manager Ronald Koeman . Davis impressed for Northern Ireland against Greece this week, helping his country to a shock 2-0 win . 'I'm delighted to have signed a new contract,' Davis told Southampton's youtube account. 'I've enjoyed my football since I came here and the club is continually progressing. 'I'm excited to see where we can go together over the next few years. The club is run the right way and they try to do everything to their best ability. 'Nobody wants to stand still. We want to get better - that goes for the team and myself. I'd like to win trophies here and continually try to improve our league position. I feel we can do that at this club. 'It was a difficult summer - there's no getting away from that. But the board stayed strong and the club made some really good signings in the manager and players that came in. Davis has been a key player for Southampton since their promotion to the top flight in 2012 . Koeman, who has made a great start to life at St Mary's, is pleased with his captain's early-season form . 'It's unbelievable how everyone has settled. We've had a lot of changes but it feels like we've been playing together for a lot longer than we have. We've had an exciting start and we're determined to go on and keep progressing.' Koeman hailed the Northern Ireland captain, who led his nation to a memorable 2-0 win over Greece in Athens earlier this week, for the impact he has on his team-mates in the Southampton dressing room. 'I'm very happy because Steven is one of the key players in the team,' the Dutchman said. 'He is an international player who is doing well this season, as he has for the last few seasons. Koeman and Graziano Pelle received the manager and player of the month awards for September . 'I see Steven every day in training and in the dressing room. He is not a person who stands out by shouting a lot, but his professionalism and performances are what sets him apart and makes him such a good example for the rest of the players. 'Players like Steven are so great to have in your team, and also for the younger players who are looking to make it into the first team because they can see first hand what you have to do to become a player at the highest level like him.'","Davis has signed a new contract to stay at St Mary's until 2018 .

"Northern Ireland defender Jonny Evans has hailed the team's efforts in his absence following Tuesday's 2-0 away victory over Greece. Michael O'Neill's side have now won all of their opening three Euro 2016 qualifiers - the country's best ever start to any World Cup or European qualifying series. Evans has missed the entire campaign so far, having at first been suspended and then sat out the last two fixtures due to an ankle injury. Northern Ireland players celebrate Kyle Lafferty's goal as they record their third win in a row in Greece . Injured Northern Ireland defender Jonny Evans says he is 'immensely proud' of his side's Euro qualifying efforts . Evans hasn't taken the pitch since limping off during United's 5-3 loss to Leicester on September 21 . The Manchester United man admits it has been 'absolutely gutting' for him to not be involved, but what he has seen from the sidelines has made him hugely proud. 'Obviously, it (the Greece result) was a great win for the team and I think it was thoroughly deserved,' Evans told manutd.com. 'We had a really good game-plan against Greece and it's fantastic we've got three wins on the trot at the start of the campaign. It sets us up going forward for the rest of the games. 'We've had spells in the past where we've had a lot of wins but the pleasing thing is two of the victories have come away from home, where it's always been difficult for us. 'We had some good performances throughout the last campaign but just came up short with the results. 'I think the manager has done a fantastic job in getting everybody together and believing in ourselves.' Lafferty celebrates Northern Ireland's second goal in Athens in their Euro 2016 qualifying victory . Jamie Ward (centre) opened the scoring with a deflected volley to set Michael O'Neill's side on their way . The 26-year-old, whose younger brother Corry Evans started Tuesday's contest, added: 'It's been absolutely gutting to miss the games but I'm immensely proud of the lads for the way they've performed. 'I've been in regular contact with my brother obviously and I'm pleased to see the lads performing so well and getting the result.' Evans hopes to get his participation in the qualifying campaign under way in Northern Ireland's next fixture, November's trip to Romania - although he may have a job on his hands breaking up a centre-back pairing of Gareth McAuley and Aaron Hughes that have performed admirably so far. O'Neill's men are top of Group F having seen off Hungary away and the Faroe Islands at home prior to Tuesday's triumph.

"Northern Ireland forward Kyle Lafferty felt his team sent out a massive statement with a stunning win over Group F favourites Greece in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Athens.

Lafferty is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring - he praised the side's belief and unity after the match . 'We wouldn't have expected to win our first three games but I had a good feeling about this one,' he said.

The players are delighted too, but I don't think they're surprised. 'They believed they could come here and get something from the game.

"Liverpool midfielder Suso and Real Madrid contract rebel Sami Khedira could be targets for AC MIlan, says the Italian giants' chief executive Adriano Galliani. Suso arrived from Cadiz in 2010 but has only made 21 appearances for Liverpool, his last a Capital One Cup outing in September.

Meanwhile, Milan are also keen on a potential move for Khedira, who will be free to leave the Bernabeu at the end of the season. Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have also been heavily linked with a move for the Germany midfielder, who  has reportedly turned down two deals from Real. 'Khedira?

The England international started against West Brom on Saturday but hasn’t scored for Liverpool yet in eight appearances. With Daniel Sturridge the number one choice up front and with the arrival of Mario Balotelli this summer, Lambert has found sustained game time limited so far this season. Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert has had playing time limited at his new club since arriving this summer . Former Liverpool striker Collymore is concerned with the club’s mixed start to the campaign: . ‘I'm worried about Liverpool. They had a disappointing Champions League performance against Basel, and Brendan Rodgers is being stretched to his coaching limit right now,’ Collymore told bleacher report. In order to turn form around Collymore believes Lambert is needed and could be the catalyst to enable Brendan Rodgers to rotate his side and add diversity to their attack. The England international started against West Brom on Saturday but was replaced by Mario Balotelli . ‘When it comes to strikers, Mario Balotelli is the opposite of Luis Suarez. I wonder if there's the option to play two up front and a diminutive three behind. ‘Rickie Lambert could be very useful, but only if he's given a run of five or six games to settle in and do the business. ‘I've been a striker at that level. You have to find your rhythm, and you need games to get into a groove. 'I'd go with a 4-4-2 diamond that includes Balotelli and Lambert. That would give Rodgers the chance to rest Daniel Sturridge, or use all three, with one of Balotelli or Sturridge in a withdrawn role. ‘Rodgers has to make something happen at Liverpool, and Lambert could be the catalyst.’ Lambert faces competition from Daniel Sturridge (right) who has returned to training after an injury lay-off .","England international has failed to score for his new club yet .

"Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini found the perfect answer to his critics after firing in a spectacular equaliser at The Hawthorns after just three minutes on the pitch. The much maligned Belgium midfielder received strict orders from Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal on the bench during the first-half. Van Gaal then ordered the 26-year-old to warm up on his own during the break before replacing Ander Herrera with Fellaini.

Fellaini soon took note of Van Gaal's directions as the rest of the United squad look on at the Hawthorns . After the match, van Gaal admitted he knew he'd call upon Fellaini to turn fortunes around. '(I knew) after 30 minutes. And then I said (to Fellaini) to look what Herrera is doing because I want you to play,' said van Gaal. West Brom's official Twitter account tweeted a teasing update at half-time saying 'Fellaini has now taken his tracksuit off, fortunately he has a Man Utd strip on underneath #WBAMUN'. However Fellaini proved his worth immediately. The 26-year-old was sent to warm up during the half-time break on his own before replacing Ander Herrera . Radamel Falcao and Fellaini look glum after starting the match at West Brom on the substitute bench . Within three minutes of the restart he won an aerial battle with Joleon Lescott on the edge of West Brom's area, set the ball up wide on the right, and fired in an unstoppable drive in to the top right corner past Boaz Myhill. Remarkably that was Fellaini's first goal for United since signing last September and the Belgian was delighted, 'It was a great feeling. I've waited a long time for this moment,' he said after the match. West Brom later insisted that the intention of the tweet was to make a Carry On-style gag about Fellaini 'stripping off' but instead of being naked under his tracksuit top, he had a United shirt on. Albion say it was not meant to be a put-down. That joke was probably not worth the effort, in hindsight. West Brom posted this harsh tweet just as Fellaini prepared to come on at half-time at the Hawthorns .

"Sportsmail’s Martin Keown has hailed Mesut Ozil’s return to form for Arsenal after the German playmaker inspired the Gunners to a 3-0 victory at Aston Villa on Saturday. The German international had started the season in dismal form, mainly playing out on the left, which was compounded by his dreadful showing against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday. Ozil, the £42million club record signing, returned to his preferred central role where he played for the majority of his time at Real Madrid, and responded to calls that he should be dropped with his best performance for some considerable time. Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil celebrates firing Arsenal into the lead on Saturday at Aston Villa . Martin Keown lauded Ozil's 'magnificent' Arsenal performance which inspired the Gunners to victory . The former Arsenal defender noticed a difference in Ozil with team mate Alexis Sanchez on the bench . ‘With Alexis Sanchez not playing, the team was dancing for his boots. Sanchez will obviously come back in at some point but Ozil was magnificent in the central role today,’ said Keown as a pundit on Match of the Day. ‘Ozil was magnificent in the central role, he pressed all the right buttons and orchestrated all of Arsenal’s best attacks,’ added Keown. His creativity was most potent in a concentrated burst of three minutes when Arsenal scored the goals to win this game but throughout the match he showed his true class. Mesut Ozil put in an outstanding performance against Aston Villa in a central role to silence his recent critics . ‘His goal was a consequence of brilliant play, he was really calm as he slotted it home into the corner. ‘There was an ease to his play as the number 10, he was energised in the centre and looked like he wanted to go forward all the time which would have pleased Arsene Wenger,’said Keown. Arsenal manager then faces a conundrum whether to keep Ozil in the centre, espcecially with a plethora of attacking midfield options at his disposal.

"Mario Balotelli has a reputation as a joker - but it seems he feels he is more like another Batman villain, Bane. The Liverpool forward posted a picture on Instagram of himself in a mask and referenced Bane in a hashtag. And after failing to impress against the Villans last week, Balotelli was a hero in midweek against Ludogorets, scoring his first Liverpool goal, and will look to the bane of West Ham's defenders' lives at Upton Park on Saturday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mario has Raheem in stitches during Liverpool training . Liverpool star Mario Balotelli is up to his usual tricks as he masks up in this Instagram post . Balotelli's mask resembles the look of Batman villain Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises' film from 2012 . Bane is a super-villain who appears in the Batman comics and films. He was most recently played by Tom Hardy in the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises. He is an escpaed convict who has abnormal strength and is one of Batman's most challenging foes. He became known as 'The Man Who Broke the Bat' when he broke Batman's back. Brendan Rodgers has hailed the forward's attitude and work rate since he joined Liverpool and says he will only improve. ‘You saw his work rate. He’s put his body on the line and he needs to do more of that but I think that will come as he gets fitter. 'But he’s well in tune with the history of the club. I think you can see what he’s trying to put in for the team. That’s going to be very important. ‘The crowd demand that as the players who’ve been here in the past in that position have been non-stop and he’s becoming attuned to that. He’s aware of the demands and it’s going to take time but if he continues to score goals and work hard, he will be fine as he has got the quality.’ Balotelli began paying back his £16m investment by scoring with his first goal for Liverpool on Tuesday .

"Andy Murray reached the quarter-finals of the Erste Bank Open after a hard-fought 6-4, 6-4 win over Vasek Pospisil of Canada on Thursday. The second-seeded Murray, who had a bye in the first round, dropped serve while leading 3-2 in the second set but held off five more break chances for Pospisil. 'Hopefully I can improve for my next game,' the Scot said after his 470th career win. He joined Fabrice Santoro in 50th place on the Open era win list. Andy Murray punches the air in celebration after winning a point in his second-round match in Vienna . The Scot is making his tournament debut after revising his schedule in order to make a late push for a spot in the ATP World Tour Finals next month, following defeat to David Ferrer in the Shanghai Open. The 27-year-old took a wild card entry into the Vienna competition, where he is seeded No 2, to try to move from 11th-place in the rankings to inside the top eight, so he can compete at the season-ending showpiece in London. Pospisil had 27 aces in his first-round win over Daniel Brands of Germany but just three against Murray. Murray plays Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany next, who won the last seven points in the third-set tiebreaker to beat Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine 7-6 (6), 2-6, 7-6 (3). Canadian Vasek Pospisil returns the ball during his straight-sets defeat to second-seed Murray . David Ferrer advanced to his 15th quarter-final of the season after defeating Tobias Kamke of Germany 7-5, 6-1. The fifth-ranked Ferrer, the top seed, avoided service breaks and converted his second match point with a forehand winner. 'It was tough in the first set but in the second I played better, more solid, more consistent,' said Ferrer, who plays No. 6 Ivo Karlovic of Croatia in the quarter-finals. The Spaniard needs to reach Sunday's final to improve his chances of qualifying for the ATP Finals. Earlier, Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil rallied to beat the 2004 champion, No. 3 Feliciano Lopez, 6-7 (9), 6-1, 6-4. Lopez, who was ranked a career-high 14th after beating Rafael Nadal on his way to the Shanghai semi-finals last week, lost eight straight games from 1-1 in the second. The Spaniard also lost 19 points in a row, including the first 13 of the final set. Murray, making his debut at the Erste Bank Open, was made to work hard for the win by his opponent . Bellucci will meet Viktor Troicki of Serbia, who reached his third quarter-final since returning from a doping ban in July by beating No. 5 Lukas Rosol of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-2. Also, Benjamin Becker of Germany defeated last year's finalist, Robin Haase of the Netherlands, 6-3, 6-3, winning six straight games to lead by a set and 2-0.

"Wayne Rooney will shortly establish himself as the most-celebrated player in English football history. Against Slovenia next month he is expected to win his 100th cap for England, putting him in prime position to break Peter Shilton’s all-time record of 125 appearances. Sir Bobby Charlton is also in his sights, his goalscoring record for both England and Manchester United also within range. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney talk ahead of  Euro 2016 qualifier vs Estonia . With 98 caps and 42 goals, Wayne Rooney is closing in on England's appearances and goals record . Rooney places a hand round the shoulder of Raheem Sterling in Tallinn ahead of England's game in Estonia . The England captain will hope to lead his side to a third straight win in their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign . Peter Shilton (125) David Beckham (115) Steven Gerrard (114) Bobby Moore (108) Ashley Cole (107) Sir Bobby Charlton (106) Frank Lampard (106) Billy Wright (105) Wayne Rooney (98) But in Croxteth, the suburb of Liverpool in which he grew up, it appears he remains what he always was: just another street player ready for a kickabout. The England captain has revealed that on his frequent visits back to Merseyside, he still enjoys a game on the streets where he grew up. In case Louis van Gaal and the Manchester United medical staff start worrying, he insists that it is very low intensity stuff – keepy ups and tricks rather than a full-scale game. Nevertheless, it is a delightful image to imagine, the man who will captain England against Estonia hanging out by a park bench with his mates and knocking a ball around. ‘I’ve always believed myself to be from the streets in terms of football,’ said Rooney. ‘I’ve always played on the streets with friends and still do now and again when I get time, I go and do that. That is where I learnt to play football. There was a lot of help along the way from the academy but the majority of my football was learnt on the streets. Former goalkeeper Peter Shilton (left) has a record 125 caps for England, while Sir Bobby Charlton (106 caps) is the Three Lions' record goalscorer with 49 goals between 1958 and 1970 . David Beckham is England's most capped outfield player on 115 while Bobby Moore (108) is the only Three Lions skipper to lift major silverware in the 1966 World Cup . Sir Bobby Charlton (49) Gary Lineker (48) Jimmy Greaves (44) Wayne Rooney (42) ‘Now and again I go back and see friends where I am from and we have a kick around. Everywhere we go, we sit there and there is a ball. I’m obviously not running around but we stand there and have a kick-around. Nobody is really fussed. I’m back there quite a lot. It’s just keepy-ups and messing around.’ Given England’s start to their qualifying it seems certain Rooney will be captaining England into Euro 2016 and probably the World Cup in Russia, 2018. By that time the significant England records should have been broken by him: Shilton’s 125 caps and Charlton’s 49 goals. ‘I couldn’t imagined that when I made my first appearance for England,’ said Rooney. ‘At that age you don’t look beyond the next game. You are lucky and it is a privilege to play for England in the games that I’ve clocked up. It’s there now, two more games. I’ve always said that I don’t want to stop playing for England after I get 100 caps, I want to get many more after that and try to do my best for the team. Frank Lampard picked up his 107th and last England cap as skipper against Costa Rica at the World Cup . Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole have also recently joined the 100 club for England but since retired . Billy Wright was the first England player to reach 100 caps featuring between 1946 and 1959 . ‘I used to love watching England. I remember the 1998 World Cup and the stand-out moment was Michael Owen and what he did. That is when I really started watching England closely, then at Everton everything happened so quickly for me in terms of the progressing through the youth team and then the first team, then within six months into the England set-up. It is always a dream playing for England and thankfully I’ve done it many times. ‘It’s an honour to play for England, which I’ve said many times. Everyone has seen the likes of Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole in recent times pass the 100-cap mark and hopefully I play in the next two games and I can do that. It will be a proud moment for me.’ Wayne Rooney made his England debut as a substitute in a 3-1 defeat by Australia at Upton Park in 2003 . Rooney’s first appearance came in controversial circumstances, a 3-1 defeat against Australia in 2003 at Upton Park in which Sven Goran Eriksson was heavily criticised for substituting the entire team at half. At least Eriksson got something right: Rooney was one of the second-half substitutes. ‘It was a bit strange,’ said Rooney. ‘Australia at West Ham and we lost 3-1. It was a complete change at half-time. I came on. It was great as me and Franny Jeffers played the second half up front together. We were from the same area and same school and had a few coaches coming up from the school taking the kids to watch. I’d only just left school as well. It was a great day.’ Eleven and a half years on, the century looms and then at least another two years of games. Suddenly Shilton’s record of 125 caps seems well within range. ‘I believe so,’ said Rooney. ‘I think it’s 16 or 17 games before the Euros start so I obviously won’t be too far away then and then I have at least another two years after that. I’m happy if they all fit in. There is no reason to think about stop playing.’","Wayne Rooney set to become ninth England player to reach 100 caps .

"Wayne Rooney has targeted Peter Shilton’s record of 125 England caps as he closes in on a raft of historic landmarks in English football. The England captain, who is 29 later this month, will become the youngest player to reach 100 England caps when England play Slovenia on November 15 and will then be targeting David Beckham’s record for an outfield player of 115 caps, as well as Shilton’s all-time record of 125. Rooney will break Bobby Moore’s record as the youngest player to reach a century of caps — Moore was 32 when he achieved the feat — and is closing in on Sir Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring records for England and Manchester United, so the next two years are likely to see him take his place among the English game’s greatest players.

I’ve always said that I don’t want to stop after I get 100, I want to get many more and try to do my best for the team.’ Asked whether he could overhaul Shilton’s 125 caps, Rooney said: ‘I believe so.

Unless told otherwise by the coaches I will always be available for selection.’ Rooney is on 42 international goals, seven away from Charlton’s record of 49 in 106 appearances and closing in on Jimmy Greaves (44) and Gary Lineker (48) on the all-time list.

Tim Sherwood was sacked by Tottenham in May but has been encouraged by their start to the current season . 'They've done well.

'It was a little bit difficult for them against Liverpool but they should've won the game on Saturday against Sunderland.

Sherwood was asked whether Spurs can finish in the top four with Champions League qualification come the end of the season. 'It's similar to how it's always been. It's always going to be very difficult and we know that Man United might come to the party this year as well so it almost makes it even more difficult,' added Sherwood.

"Brendan Rodgers has warned Liverpool that Real Madrid are the best counter-attacking side in the world and highlighted Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale's Olympic-standard pace as the key to their threat. The Reds manager has given a stunning interview to Spanish newspaper AS in which he admits that he wants to manage in Spain one day and that his team are struggling after losing Luis Suarez in the summer. Liverpool limped to a 3-2 victory over QPR at Loftus Road on Sunday, which was clinched thanks to two own goals. But their task will be an awful lot tougher at Anfield on Wednesday night when Ronaldo and Bale will, if fit, lead the European champions into battle against Rodgers' underdogs.

The Northern Irishman suggested that Ronaldo and Bale were so fast they could even give Usain Bolt, Justin Gatlin and Co a run for their money. 'There is no one better on the counter attack because in Ronaldo and Bale, they have two players that could be in the Olympic 100 metres final,' he said. But Rodgers was also keen to stress that Carlo Ancelotti's side are not a two-man team and boast attacking threats all over the pitch.

There are also 23 from his time with the Selecao, for whom he won 97 caps and scored 33 goals. Ronaldinho posted a message with the picture saying: 'Look at that collection Giovanny Tocohua has of the shirts I wore at the clubs I played for. My story is written in that picture! Thanks for caring!' Tocohua must have spent hundreds of pounds in amassing the collection and appears to have every home, away and third shirt Ronaldinho has turned out in. Italian job: Ronaldinho played three seasons at AC Milan between 2008 and 2011, winning the Serie A title in his last season at the San Siro .

"Andy Gray is at the centre of another sexism storm after video footage emerged of him aiming inappropriate comments at Sky Sports reporter Clare Tomlinson. The former Everton and Scotland striker, who made his return to British television after a three-year absence last weekend as pundit for BT Sport in their FA Cup fourth-round coverage, is facing more embarrassment along with his former Sky colleague Richard Keys.

"Slavisa Jokanovic has been appointed the new Watford manager after a bizarre week at the club. The former Chelsea midfielder takes over at Vicarage Road as Billy McKinlay left the Hornets after just eight days in charge. McKinlay became Watford's third manager this season following Oscar Garcia's decision to stand down and the departure of Giuseppe Sannino. Slavisa Jokanovic has been appointed the new Watford manager after a bizarre week at the club . Billy McKinlay has left Watford after just eight days in charge at the Championship club .

But McKinlay has vacated his post after taking charge of just two games. Sportsmail understands he wasn't willing to stand aside - taking up a role as assistant - to allow a foreign coach to come in. Jokanovic will be remembered by Chelsea fans after a two-year stint at Stamford Bridge, while the 46-year-old has managed Partizan Belgrade, Levski Sofia and Hercules. Explaining the decision to hire the Serbian, Pozzo said in a statement published on the club's official website: 'Our job is always to act in the best long-term interests of this football club. There can be no compromise on this - whatever the circumstances. 'I fully support and endorse the view from our technical staff that, given the talented squad which has been assembled and our position in the league, an experienced head coach with a winning pedigree is of primary importance to help ensure the success we are all striving for. 'The supporters of Watford have always been very understanding towards our project here and I am certain they will continue to do everything they can to support the new coach and his squad.'

On taking the top job at Watford, McKinlay left his role as Northern Ireland assistant manager in order to focus fully on his job at Vicarage Road. Former Dundee United, Blackburn and Scotland midfielder McKinlay spent nine years coaching at Fulham before leaving following Martin Jol's sacking last season.

"Vincent Kompany has allayed any lingering injury fears after departing Belgium’s Euro 2016 qualifier early on Friday night. The Manchester City captain was substituted in the 55th minute, with pictures emerging of the central defender appearing to be given some treatment to his right leg. But Kompany is insistent that his withdrawal – Belgium were already three goals up against Andorra – was merely a precaution. There were concerns over a potential injury for the Manchester City captain as he was strapped up on the bench after being substituted after 55 minutes . ‘Before the game I already had a slight problem and the coach decided to take me out,’ Kompany told RTBF. ‘I am now getting ready for Bosnia. It was not easy out there.’ While Marc Wilmots will want the 28-year-old fit and firing for a sterner test against Bosnia on Monday night, it is Manuel Pellegrini who will be breather the heavier sigh of relief. City can ill-afford to be without their skipper during a crucial four days to see them face Tottenham at the Etihad Stadium next Saturday before a trip to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League as they attempt to get back on track in Group E.

"In the grim aftermath of Manchester United's mauling in Milton Keynes, Louis van Gaal was asked by a reporter whether the manner of his side's capitulation had shocked him. 'I am not shocked,' came the stern response, delivered with an uncompromising eye-lock glare. Van Gaal genuinely wasn't shocked, and nor was he especially worried, since the experience of his coaching career has taught him that in order to achieve success, you must first work through the 'process.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal say a new team is not built in a day . Rebuilding job: Louis van Gaal said he was 'not shocked' by Man United's 4-0 mauling at MK Dons .

August 16 Swansea (H) 1-2 . August 24 Sunderland (A) 1-1 . August 26 MK Dons (A) 0-4 . Capital One Cup second round . He said as much on Tuesday night: 'We have to see in the process, that's what I'm saying. The process needs time. We are building up a team and you cannot make it in one month.' The Dutchman is a notoriously slow starter in new jobs and new seasons. What we saw at Ajax, Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar and Bayern Munich, we are currently seeing at United. In fact, he is such a slow starter that the superb form seen on United's pre-season tour of the United States seemed too good to be true. And so it has proved, with United collecting just one point from a possible six in the Premier League and exiting the League Cup before the point they would normally enter it. But United fans should not be concerned. It will be all right in the end, as a glance back at Van Gaal's career proves. When he arrived at Bayern Munich in 2009, Van Gaal described them as his 'dream club' but things soon turned into a bit of a nightmare. They started with back-to-back draws against Hoffenheim and Werder Bremen before slumping to defeat at Mainz. They won only five of their opening 13 matches and by the end of November they were 8th. Recovery: Van Gaal started slowly when he took over at Bayern Munich in 2009 but went on to win the league . Leg-end: Van Gaal shows off his knees as Bayern celebrate their 2010 Bundesliga triumph . Lift it high: Bayern were eighth at the end of November but then went unbeaten until March to secure the title . August 30 Burnley (A) September 14 QPR (H) September 21 Leicester City (A) September 27 West Ham (H) October 5 Everton (H) October 20 West Brom (A) Allied to this was a dreadful start to their Champions League campaign, with home and away defeats by Bordeaux leaving them staring at an early exit and Van Gaal fighting for his job. He responded in typically ebullient fashion ahead of a trip to Freiburg in late October. Repeatedly describing himself as a 'Prozesstrainer' ('Process manager'), Van Gaal laid down the law: 'I am at Bayern Munich, either you give me time or you don't.' Bayern won 2-1 at Freiburg and remained unbeaten until late March, hitting the summit of the table just after the winter break. They won the title by five points and recovered from their shaky start to reach the final of the Champions League. Van Gaal was vindicated, his 'process', once seen through to its end, was a successful one. When he guided unfashionable Alkmaar to the Eredivisie title in 2009, the season started with back-to-back defeats by NAC Breda and ADO Den Haag. They promptly went 28 matches unbeaten and won the league by 11 points. Repeat: Van Gaal's AZ Alkmaar also started slowly in 2008-2009 but they went on to claim the title . Dwarfed: It took Van Gaal some time to convince the fans at Barcelona that he was the right man for the job . Protest: Fans at the Nou Camp called for Van Gaal to be dismissed as results didn't go their way . At Barcelona, he dismayed pretty much everyone at the club by trying to enforce his philosophy, which was completely different to the club's. Van Gaal asked star man Rivaldo to play on the left wing rather than through the middle, leading to rows in the camp and the fans getting on his back. At the end of his first season, many remained unhappy, as Jimmy Burns recorded in his book, Barca: A People's Passion: 'The jury is out on Van Gaal, a Dutchman lacking the humanity of Bobby Robson and the popularity of Johan Cruyff, both of whose heads have rolled in the space of less than two years. 'Barca may be at the top of the league, but the fans are unconvinced. They have watched the team pathetically founder in Europe, while continuing to play lacklustre football in the League, winning seemingly by default rather than design.' But you couldn't argue with the results - well, eventually. The following year, Barca found themselves 10th in La Liga in early December and at one stage they lost four on the bounce. Upset: Van Gaal did not make himself popular by trying to move Barcelona hero Rivaldo . Making his case: Van Gaal presents the Barcelona squad during his second spell in charge . When things finally clicked, Barcelona won 19 of their next 24 games, winning the title by a commanding 11-point margin. It all came right in the end. And this pattern dates right back to the beginning of his managerial career, when he was named manager of Ajax against all the odds back in 1991. Though a managerial novice, Van Gaal was a disciplinarian and his methods certainly ruffled a few feathers. He fell out with leading players Jan Wouters, Bryan Roy and Johnny van't Schip by tinkering with their positions on the field. And when Ajax took just 20 points from their first 16 games, Van Gaal had to endure the fans calling for club legend Johan Cruyff to replace him. Vindicated: Van Gaal struggled initially at Ajax but he eventually delivered the European Cup . 'I will not change my attitude,' Van Gaal said. He didn't, and his time in Amsterdam yielded three Dutch league titles, the UEFA Cup and the Champions League in 1995. So history tells us that Van Gaal will stubbornly stick to his methods at United. We may see some teething troubles with the 3-5-2 formation and certain players will have to adapt. We may also see things getting worse before they get better - United could not be near the top four come the turn of the year. But history also informs us that, once the 'process' is seen through, Van Gaal will deliver success. Slow starts to silverware are his speciality.

"Liverpool's 1981 European Cup winner Alan Kennedy believes Cristiano Ronaldo is to Real Madrid what Kenny Dalglish and Graeme Souness were to the Reds' all-conquering side. The Portugal international arrives on Merseyside for Wednesday's Champions League tie having just broken a 71-year-old La Liga record by scoring 15 goals in the first eight matches of the season. While he is the player opponents have to worry most about, Kennedy - who scored the only goal as the Reds beat Madrid in the final at Parc de Princes 33 years ago - said in his day Liverpool had players whom worried their rivals.

Is there anyone the equivalent of Ronaldo?"" he told Press Association Sport. ""Looking back they (opponents) will say 'They had Dalglish and Souness'. Souness and Dalglish did it in my day. ""Souness was a player everyone admired and players who played alongside him will say he was the most influential player on the pitch because he was a leader, he wanted success. ""Ronaldo is slightly different. Although he has worked hard to play within the team, when he gets the ball he does excite everyone and that is what Dalglish did. ""Liverpool players have not got to have any fear about it, but have to be wary this guy can do anything with the ball."" Kennedy feels Brendan Rodgers' (above) side will be frustrated by their Champions League displays so far . Brendan Rodgers' side face back-to-back matches against the reigning European champions, who collected their 10th crown last May, and need to get something out of them having dropped to third in Group B with defeat against Basle last time out. ""It is a competition that is synonymous with Liverpool,"" he said of the five-time winners. ""Liverpool want to progress as far as they can and they have to pick up points against all the teams.

"The heroism of Sam Burgess stepped up a notch on Tuesday after it was revealed the South Sydney star played on with a fractured eye socket as well as his broken cheekbone. The 25-year-old, who moves to the rugby union side later this month, will undergo surgery having suffered the injuries in the first minute against Canterbury Bulldogs and gone on to play the full game. It is the latest development in a story that will see Burgess go down in rugby league folklore. Sam Burgess (left)  played on with a suspected broken cheekbone for South Sydney in the NRL Grand Final . Burgess went on to win the Clive Churchill Medal (left) man of the match before getting his hand on the trophy . 'Just laying in hospital waiting for surgery, I look similar to a hamster at the moment. I wouldn't change anything for the world though,' Burgess wrote on Twitter. 'Thanks to everyone for your well wishes and congratulations. It's been an amazing journey this year with a fitting end. Wow.' His club said in a statement: 'Scans this morning have confirmed that Rabbitohs lock Sam Burgess requires surgery to repair fractures in his cheekbone and eye socket,' it said. 'Burgess will have surgery this afternoon to have a plate inserted into his face to repair the damage.' Burgess was supposed to fly back to England on Wednesday ahead of switching codes with Bath. It is not yet known whether he will stay in Australia a little while longer. Bath expect Sam Burgess will need six weeks to recover from his broken cheekbone after an heroic, match-winning performance in Sunday's NRL Grand Final in Sydney which confirmed his place in rugby league folklore.

He was already facing a hasty education in the 15-man game in an attempt to force his way into England's World Cup squad for next year's tournament. Now the learning process will have to start later than planned. Last week, his new club released a video to herald his arrival and it ended with the date 25.10.14, which is when Toulouse visit The Rec in the European Champions Cup. However, it is understood that Burgess will just be introduced that day. Burgess' mother Julie greets him after the NRL Grand Final victory for the Rabbitohs .

His five-year stint with the South Sydney Rabbitohs ended in glorious fashion, as he gallantly inspired the club's first NRL title in 43 years — making 36 tackles and running 225 metres. He was in tears at the end, before being chaired off the pitch and becoming the first non-Australian to win the Clive Churchill Medal as man of the match in a Grand Final. Asked about the injury at half-time, he blurted out: 'It's f*****. It's gone.' After the game, he added: 'To be honest I couldn't feel the pain. I knew I'd broken it straight away. My face felt numb and I had blurred vision.' Burgess twin brothers — Tom and George — also made telling impacts as their mother Julie watched in the stands. George went off with concussion in the first half but returned to score a vital try. Burgess is lifted onto his team-mates' shoulders after the Rabbitohs won the NRL Grand Final .

"Mauricio Pochettino describes his time at Southampton as the best in his life but is not sure of the reception he will receive from his former club’s fans. The Tottenham manager on Sunday will  face the Saints for the first time since leaving the club at the end of last season when the pair meet at White Hart Lane. Spurs have struggled to fully exert themselves on the Premier League under his regime and this represents a tough proposition against visitors who have won four of their five competitive games away from home under new manager Ronald Koeman. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino describes his time at Southampton as the best period of his life . Pochettino enjoyed a successful 18 month spell as Saints manager before he joined Tottenham . Pochettino said: ‘Southampton was the best period in my life. A lot of people love me from Southampton and I have good memories. I’m happy for their start to the League. ‘In your life you need to make decisions. When I take a decision I always believe. Maybe you have luck or not but when you take a decision you need to look forward.’ Even after wholesale changes during the summer — in which Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren and Calum Chambers were sold — Koeman has continued the progress of the past four years. That does not come as a surprise to Pochettino, who said: ‘He’s a very good manager. He showed at Feyenoord, Benfica and Valencia that he is a great manager.’ Adam Lallana (centre) was one of many players to follow Pochettino out of Southampton this summer . And Koeman believes a change in philosophy has helped turn Southampton into surprise Champions League contenders. Pochettino used to put on gruelling double training sessions, prompting midfielder Jack Cork to say he needed ‘two hearts’ to get through matches. But Koeman said: ‘I am not a coach who thinks the physical side is not important, but it isn’t more important than the session with the ball. I still believe in dominating the game to have good possession. I am Dutch, we like to train like that.’ Pochettino's successor at Southampton Ronald Koeman believes a change of philosophy has helped the club .","Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino admits managing Southampton as the best time of his life .

"Is Yaya Toure back? The problem with him is that you never can tell. For every lung-busting drive through the middle of midfield there is a lazy waft of the right boot and shrug of the shoulders. This game, however, hinged on a loitering run and swish into Brad Guzan’s net, serving as a reminder that he still means business. The 31-year-old was nowhere near his best and is an ever-increasing enigma, but one Manchester City know they must persevere with. The alternative - Fernandinho alongside Fernando - is unimaginative and one-paced. In keeping with this season thus far the Ivorian flitted in and out at Villa Park. There were flashes - a lovely dinked ball from a standing start to almost present Sergio Aguero with a golden opportunity - but also moments you sat and wondered whether this was really the same player who could have pipped Luis Suarez to the major Premier League gong in May. Yaya Toure gave Manchester City the lead in their 2-0 win at Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday . Toure (centre) put City ahead with a majestic left-footed curler into the bottom corner in the 82nd minute . Toure (centre left) is congratulated by his Manchester City team-mates (right) for his goal . The death of his brother Ibrahim earlier this year is bound to have had a lasting impact - it would on anyone. That tragedy can go a long way to suggesting why Toure is in and out, not looking himself. But the overt jostling for a summer move, with a birthday cake as a farcical by-product, means Toure has become an easy target for persistent criticism. Some of it is undoubtedly unfair. City owe a lot to Toure, who has been a major reason why they have clinched two titles and are mixing it in Europe. But those who question his desire appear to be doing so justifiably. Toure rarely breaks sweat and rarely gets himself into either box. The game can occasionally pass him by. The one saving grace at Villa Park is that he became more urgent as the clock ticked down. But his persistent dip in form is obviously becoming more than a passing concern for Manuel Pellegrini. But this was vintage. A passenger for the majority and a stroke of genius to clinch it late on. Despite his goal Toure wasn't at his best for Manchester City against Aston Villa on Saturday evening . The 31-year-old (centre) still seems a shadow of himself from last season . Toure's heat map shows the Manchester City midfielder didn't break into the Aston Villa box once . Toure did the basics well at Villa Park - highlighted by his 90.1 per cent passing accuracy during the match . Toure did the basics well, helping out his back four to good effect, but didn’t seem to be the key to unlock stubborn resistance yet again. That was summed up midway through the second half when - 25 yards from goal - he aimlessly clipped a ball into the box without thought. He then inexplicably over-hit a routine ball for David Silva. The shoulders slumped, the head went down. In keeping with his curious way, Toure then  drove with purpose at goal and almost passed an effort beyond Guzan to set City on their way. So where do we stand with him? Nobody quite knows. The Ivory Coast international (right) looked lethargic when the hosts broke quickly on the counter-attack .

"Mauricio Pochettino isn't sure what reception he'll receive from the Southampton fans on Sunday, but has left them in no doubt he still loves the club. The Tottenham manager upped sticks at the end of last season - a move to coincide with a mass walkout by the club's top players at St Mary's. Pochettino has come in for some criticism after his decision to opt for a move to White Hart Lane after just 18 months in charge on the south coast. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Pochettino say his former club  are the best in the league . And he isn't entirely convinced whether the travelling fans will applaud him this weekend. ‘I love Southampton. One year in the period of my life was amazing, but I left. I’ve got amazing memories, he said. ‘It’s football.' Saints have gone from strength to strength under the guidance of Ronald Koeman and sit second in the Premier League. That, says Pochettino, is something he's pleased about. 'When you start with a new project and new players then why not?' he said. 'The most important thing is belief and Southampton have a great force and power. They believe - I am happy.' Former Southampton manager Pochettino is not sure what reception he will receive on Sunday . Pochettino's departure coincided with a player exodus including Luke Shaw joining Manchester United . Adam Lallana left, was another to leave Southampton in a £25m summer move to Liverpool . It is a fixture Spurs could really do with winning after a stuttering start to life under the Argentine and is an afternoon that takes on added importance to the boss. 'I have a lot of friends and a lot of people that I love in Southampton.' Pochettino - who refuses to take credit for his former side's continued progression - added. 'I’m happy for their start to the league - the players and the people in the club. I have many good memories. ‘It’s a game that we need to get the three points. We need to fight with Southampton on Sunday. It’s emotional. Football is emotional.'","Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino faces Southampton for first time since leaving St Marys in the summer .

"Tim Sherwood thinks that Mauricio Pochettino secretly believes Spurs can win the Premier League. Maybe that explains the 10 changes from Arsenal. You’d hope it was the reason for the decision, because fielding weakened teams in this competition is folly given the winners are handed a route into the Champions League - even if the hosts stretched their European record to just three defeats in 18. Mauricio Pochettino (centre) was animated throughout as Tottenham defeated Besiktas . Slaven Bilic was surely sporting one of the bushiest beards ever to have graced an English touchline. The Besiktas manager’s smart club suit didn’t particularly mirror his unkempt facial hair; the way in which the Croat’s arms flailed and head shook certainly did. Tottenham had the right idea beforehand in light of Galatasaray’s midweek antics, making sure the travelling contingent’s majority were housed inside a good 90 minutes before kick-off. The Turkish supporters marched through north London in full voice but then appeared to be more bothered about turning away chanting at each other than watching the game. There were 2,800 Besiktas fans getting behind their team in the away end at White Hart Lane . Besiktas boss Slaven Bilic (left) was sporting an impressive beard as he patrolled the touchline . Demba Ba went into this with four goals in five for three different clubs against Spurs. The striker was clearly fired up in a bid to add to that - smacking the bar just after smashing an arm into the face of Vlad Chiriches. Nobody can accuse the ex-Chelsea man of not putting himself about. Ba was involved in a heart-warming man hug at the break with Emmanuel Adebayor, who had waited for him before making his way down the tunnel. Demba Ba now has five goals in six appearances against Tottenham . The former Chelsea striker certainly made his presence felt during the Europa League clash . Mauricio Pochettino is better off leaving his players to it. As we ticked towards half-time, the Spurs boss retrieved a ball to have strayed out of play, unsuccessfully attempted to juggle it before losing control. He rightfully picked it up and volleyed back out of his hands. Wise. Edgar Davids was at the Lane - a place he calls ‘the old nest’. The former midfielder - who was last seen playing himself (and frequently seeing red) as manager of Barnet - is still a favourite here. Poor old fourth official Mike Pickel got it in both ears from Bilic and Pochettino simultaneously thanks to the incompetence of referee Manuel Grafe. First Spurs were inexplicably allowed to continue when Gokhan Tore was poleaxed on halfway, with Tomas Sivok then very fortunate to get away with hacking down Moussa Dembele just outside the box. The German officials didn’t have the best evening of their careers, it has to be said. Former Holland midfielder Edgar Davids was in attendance at White Hart Lane .

"They’re here. The mad set of Besiktas supporters to descend on north London have arrived in their thousands, ready to show Tottenham exactly what European football ought to feel like. Kick-off: Thursday October 2, 8.05pm . TV: ITV/ITV4 HD. The flock of banners, flares and unified war cries in that pocket of White Hart Lane should make it a night to savour. The travelling Turks are not AEL Limassol, Tromso or FC Sheriff – they have rocked up for points and bring a squad capable of doing some serious damage. That’s exactly why Spurs should treat this as a Champions League dress rehearsal. Demba Ba will lead the line with former Arsenal midfielder Oguzhan Ozyakup pulling strings behind him. It should pose quite a test, serving as a barometer to how far Spurs have come and the extent to which they still have to go under Mauricio Pochettino. Mauricio Pochettino faces his first real test in the UEFA Europa League when Tottenham face Besiktas . Demba Ba is yet to open his account for the Turkish side but could pose a big threat to Spurs on Thursday . There is a bedding in process with the new manager at the helm – Spurs play in a different fashion to the designs laid out by Tim Sherwood before he was unceremoniously dumped – and it will take a period of time before the Argentine cracks the problems to have blighted the club for the past three years. Pochettino is on his way to doing so, but Daniel Levy’s Champions League target looks to be a struggle in terms of qualifying domestically. While they have the ability to finish in the top four, history suggests they won’t. Nacer Chadli has impressed for Spurs this season bagging four goals in six appearances so far . That means the road to Warsaw brings added importance. Direct qualification into the continent’s premier competition by winning the secondary event should see Tottenham take this very seriously indeed. Follow all the latest #UEL action on: . - Facebook - UEFAEuropaLeague . - Twitter - EuropaLeague . - Website - uefa.com . Besiktas offer an authentic alternative to Champions League football. It is an evening whereby Spurs should be testing themselves to beat a main rival in the group and lay down a marker, but also having to play the situation too. You come up against Slaven Bilic, his touchline entourage and thousands of baying travellers. Bilic’s side worried Arsenal in August and should cause problems; other than the 1-0 second leg defeat at the Emirates Stadium they are unbeaten this season. Peter Crouch scores the only goal of the game as Spurs beat AC Milan at the San Siro in 2011 . Gareth Bale caps off a night to remember for Tottenham as they beat Inter Milan 3-1 in November 2010 . But the most important factor to this is the atmosphere, the sense of meaning. Spurs will not turn up, win 3-0 with little bother and go home. Besiktas are loud, proud and create an intimidating air wherever they play. Their supporters will expect to offer more than Galatasaray managed at the Emirates on Wednesday. The intensity should replicate the big European nights of 2010. Spurs fans will remember Inter Milan 3-1 under the lights and with a ferocious full house. AC Milan in the last-16 the year after too. They have floundered for too long since then - bought badly while chopping and changing. Now they are ready to settle. And the big games suit the club, according to Younes Kaboul. ‘If we play the same way we did at Arsenal, we should have no problems, but we need to repeat that. We have set the tone,’ he said.

"Glenn Murray is a striker who the majority of sides in the Championship would love to have in their midst. Luckily for Nigel Adkins and Reading it is they who can call upon the on-loan Crystal Palace man. A good job, really, given he thundered in a late equaliser on an afternoon that had it all. When Palace won promotion to the Premier League two years ago, Murray was the star with 31 goals. The Royals would be foolish not to talk numbers when a chance arises to make this move permanent in January. If he carries on scoring — that is three in four now — there is no reason why they cannot bounce back to the top tier. Glenn Murray wheels away in delight with his Reading team-mates after salvaging a last-gasp draw . Murray celebrates his goal as he points up towards the Reading faithful - the way the Royals could end up going this season if they keep hold off the Crystal Palace man . Adkins is already indebted to him. The ball broke to the 31-year-old on the edge of the box as we crept towards stoppage time and he viciously let fly to earn a point. ‘He’s settled in extremely well and is forming a great partnership with Simon Cox,’ said Adkins. ‘We’ve got threats in the team to go and score goals.’ You sense he was downplaying Murray’s impact. The hosts had been there for the taking before Murray’s late intervention, and Wolves should be celebrating breaking into the automatic promotion places this morning. But Kenny Jackett’s side rather threw away a golden opportunity to go level with Norwich City at the summit. ‘We’d love to be top but won’t let it bother us,’ he said. Murray, seen here in action against Millwall, has scored three goals in his four games for Reading . Murray scored goals for fun at his level with Crystal Palace, and is now repeating the same form with Reading . Murray celebrates winning promotion with Palace . Wanderers went ahead twice after initially falling behind, but on both occasions they surrendered their lead. It is games like these that may determine whether the newboys can keep pace at the top. The way in which they sought a fourth reveals a potential naivety Jackett needs to eradicate quickly. The manager, however, was quick to reject those claims after the game. ‘If you drop off they can throw men forward. You can’t just defend,’ he reasoned. ‘We’re disappointed.’ These two sides hurled men forward all game. It was a captivating contest from start to finish and points towards clubs who have the character and quality to do some damage this season. Positive signs for Reading’s new Thai owners — several of whom were here at the Madejski. Defending had long gone out the window. Wolves were dozy in not switching on to Jordan Obita’s short corner with Oliver Norwood before the latter whipped in wonderfully from the right, allowing young central defender Michael Hector to steal a yard at the near post and head home. It was a sweet moment for the 22-year-old, netting a first goal for the club that brought him through its academy. Wolves, too narrow and one-paced, struggled to really get a grip on this until the break. Just after it, Bakary Sako was finally afforded time to run at Chris Gunter on the left, drilling a cross low towards James Henry at the back post who duly obliged. That sparked a stunning four minutes as the away end — heavily populated with 1,800 visiting supporters — went berserk. Even more so three minutes after, with Lee Evans calmly slotting in a second after finding himself unmarked on the penalty spot. But Jake Taylor equalised straight from the restart, slotting under Carl Ikeme to cap off a ‘fantastic goal’ according to his manager. Nick Blackman was unfortunate to divert a corner into his own net with six minutes remaining, but it was left for Murray — dispensed with by Palace so they could sign Kevin Doyle — to have the final word. Reading defender Michael Hector scored his first-ever goal for the club against Wolves on Sunday . PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND .

"There may be clear daylight between Chelsea and the rest of the Premier League, but Jose Mourinho isn’t a happy man. He’s barely raised a smile all season, with international football — and more pertinently the World Cup — to blame. Despite five wins from six he is irked at the amount of time it’s taken for his stars — particularly the Brazilian trio of Oscar, Willian and Ramires — to energise themselves after returning in July. The Portuguese has been forced to rotate his squad far more than he would have liked in the opening six weeks, laying the blame on the carnival in Brazil and suggesting players need longer breaks or risk severe burnout. Oscar celebrates his goal against Aston Villa and was the star man for the league leaders . Jose Mourinho is less than happy despite Chelsea's flying start to the season . Chelsea's convincing win against Villa marked Chelsea's 2000th home league game since the club's inception in 1905 . ‘They need holidays, they don’t have holidays,’ Mourinho said. ‘They need a proper pre-season, they don’t have a proper pre- season. I think players are getting in trouble and when I anticipate the next pre-season it will be even worse, because there will be international matches. ‘For a World Cup some teams don’t qualify; for the international fixtures, every player goes with his national team. After that, before the start of the Premier League, they are going to have, like, two weeks of pre-season.’ Mourinho is particularly worried by the Copa America in June, which means his South American stars face back-to-back tournaments sandwiching the rigours of a season the Blues hope will last upwards of 60 games. Willian scores Chelsea's third against Villa - but Jose Mourinho is worried about him joining up with Brazil for next summer's Copa America . Diego Costa continued his flying start to the season with a stunning header against Aston Villa . He joked the club might have to sell their Latin throng — which stands at four including Filipe Luis — because of the competition. Sporting warmed up for the Champions League match with Chelsea in Lisbon with a 1-1 draw with bitter rivals Porto. Jonathan Silva put them ahead before a Mouhamadou-Naby Sarr own goal condemned them to a fourth 1-1 draw this season . Credit must be thrown in Mourinho’s direction though. While he does have a squad stacked with quality, the way in which he has tinkered with it has been astute. Oscar — the standout of Saturday’s win against Aston Villa — has been a chief beneficiary. Dropped against Schalke and Manchester City, he came back against Bolton in the Capital One Cup. Two goals later those decisions look shrewd, particularly after this sparkling display in which he opened the scoring. ‘I have had time,’ Oscar said. ‘Mourinho told me he has a lot of players, so I don’t play against City, or Schalke at the start. But I start against Bolton and I play well because I am not tired.’ Chelsea enter their second truly testing week of the season at Sporting Lisbon tomorrow before facing Arsenal on Sunday, with the club unsure whether Diego Costa will be fit enough to carry on. Mourinho said the Spain forward is ‘doing nothing’ in training as medical staff nurse him through games. Ramires is another of Chelsea's growing Brazilian contingent with the signing of Felipe Luis making it four Samba stars .","Chelsea have won five out of six in the Premier League so far .

"England's Nile Wilson won gold in a dramatic high bar final which was decided on a tie-break after he was given the same score as team-mate Kristian Thomas. Wilson was awarded the title due to his higher execution score as he and Thomas both scored 14.966, with Canada's Kevin Lytwyn winning bronze with 14.866.

Australia's Sean O' Hara was the first gymnast to compete but he lost momentum and came off the apparatus, remounting for a total that left him way off the pace. Canada's Anderson Loran then missed a catch and fell to the mat before taking another tumble as he aimed to produce some big skills, although he won the approval of the crowd if not the judges as he again resumed his routine. Wilson was up next and he nailed the first clean routine on the apparatus to put the pressure on Scotland's Keatings, who became the third man to hit the floor in the high-pressure finale. Quadruple: Wilson added a first individual title to his gold, silver and bronze medals he had already won . Keatings, who saw off the challenge of England's Whitlock and Louis Smith to win pommel horse gold, resumed his routine and scored 13.366 to briefly move into silver medal position. It was then the turn of Baines, who landed a clean routine of 14.566 to edge Scotland team-mate Keatings into bronze medal position. England's Thomas scored the same tally as Wilson but the younger member of the England squad held on to gold medal position on a tie-break as he had a higher execution score.

Arsenal have been handed an injury boost with the news that Jack Wilshere could be fit to face Galatasaray . Wilshere was forced off against Tottenham after turning his ankle under a Danny Rose challenge . Aaron Ramsey wasn't able to shake off a hamstring problem before the break against Spurs .

He was the last of the trio to be substituted during the 1-1 draw at the Emirates. Arteta endured a calf problem midway through the first half, while Ramsey failed to shake off a tweaked hamstring.

A four-minute spell early in the second half to yield three goals was the obvious highlight, but this was captivating from start to finish. Wolves were dozy in switching on to Jordan Obita’s short corner with Oliver Norwood before the latter whipped in wonderfully from the right, allowing the young central defender Michael Hector to steal a yard at the near post and thump home a header. It was a sweet moment for the 22-year-old, who netted a first goal for the club who brought him through its academy. This is his first sustained period in the first team alongside the more experienced Alex Pearce; Hector has had to work for an opportunity after no less than an astonishing 11 loan spells away in a short career. The last - a season at Aberdeen - clearly did him no harm. On-loan striker Murray showed just why the majority of the Championship wouldn’t mind having him in their midst after his quick thinking robbed Richard Stearman of possession and won the initial corner and would later flash an effort just wide after easily pushing the weak Kevin McDonald off the ball 30 yards out.

The Royals might have found themselves behind before that 19th minute opener, though. The impressive George Saville, only 21 and formerly of Chelsea, found himself in Pearce’s slipstream after intelligent work from Leon Clarke but could only fire straight at Adam Federici. Wolves, too narrow and one-paced, had struggled to really get a grip on this until the break. Six minutes after it, Bacary Sako was finally afforded time to run at Chris Gunter on the left and drilled a cross low towards James Henry at the back post who duly obliged.

The away end of the Madjeski - heavily populated with 1,800 visiting supporters  - went berserk. Even more so three minutes later. Inexplicably unmarked on the penalty spot, Lee Evans calmly slotted in a second after Obita uncharacteristically gave the ball away in his own box. The four-minute madness didn’t end there. Almost immediately from the restart the hosts were level. Simon Cox broke menacingly through the middle, playing in Jake Taylor and the winger slotted underneath Carl Ikeme. Then more drama.

"Christian Benteke is close to ending his injury nightmare and could make a long-awaited return against Manchester City on Saturday. Aston Villa have been without their talisman since March after the striker picked up a nasty achilles injury in training. It meant Benteke - whose record stands at a goal every other game for Villa - also missed out on the World Cup with Belgium. The 23-year-old has been training with the first team for the past fortnight and manager Paul Lambert hopes to have him back imminently. The news of Christian's Benteke's return to the Aston Villa squad will come as a huge boost to Paul Lambert . The Aston Villa boss will be delighted to call on the services of star striker Benteke imminently . ‘Everyone in the team will be grateful when he is back and what he hands us is an attacking force,’ Lambert said after defeat at Chelsea. ‘I will see how he does this week. He’s been with the fitness lads for a few weeks. You have to remember he has been out for five months.’ Benteke is likely to play a behind-closed-doors friendly ahead of City’s visit to determine whether he’s able to make the bench. Gabby Agbonlahor has led the line admirably in the star man’s absence, while Lambert believes Benteke could become one of the finest frontmen in world football. ‘He’s one of the best No 9s I’ve seen - even as a player. And I played with no slouches - three of the best strikers in the world at one time. He’s certainly up there and a lot younger than the lads I played with.’ Lambert name-dropped Henrik Larsson, who he was with at Celtic, as well as Karl-Heinz Reidle and Stephane Chapuisat - Dortmund’s front two during the Champions League final win against Juventus in 1997. Reidle scored twice that night in Munich. ‘They weren’t bad,’ Lambert laughed. ‘If Christian can have the career that those guys had he’ll be doing well for himself. He’s only 23 and has got a long way to go. He’s got a chance if he keeps at it.’","Benteke has been out of action since tearing his Achilles tendon in April .

"Oscar Garcia's reign as Watford head coach has come to an abrupt end following health concerns, with the club confirming Billy McKinlay has taken over. The former Fulham assistant, 45, has stepped in as Garcia stepped down after a sustained period of time in hospital over the past fortnight. The Spaniard was released from hospital last Sunday after undergoing tests on his heart and was at Watford's game against Blackburn on Saturday, albeit watching from the directors' box. Billy McKinlay has been appointed as Watford's head coach and was a former Fulham assistant . Oscar Garcia was undergoing tests on his heart and wasn't able to continue as manager . McKinlay was brought in as first team coach last week and the latest developments mark a sad end for Garcia after such promise when he arrived in August. 'I was closely involved with the appointment of Billy McKinlay, because I was aware that I may not be able to return,' Garcia said. 'I always wanted an experienced British coach within our set-up, because it's important to have that mix of cultures and experience with this squad. 'I would like to thank Watford's fans for their kindness during my time here at the club. I will be hoping to see you all as a Premier League club next season.' Hornets' CEO Scott Duxbury added: 'Everyone feels it is important that there is continuity in the coaching structure. Ruben Martinez and Javier Pereira will therefore continue as Billy McKinlay's assistants. 'We appreciate Oscar's candour in placing the best interest of Watford FC ahead of his own personal thoughts and we wish him well for his future in football. The ex-Watford boss joined a month ago as a replacement for Beppe Sannino . 'In Billy McKinlay, we have someone with the qualities and significant experience to build further on the foundations already laid for a successful season ahead.' Garcia, who only took over at Vicarage Road just over three weeks ago, has  missed the Hornets' 1-0 win at Blackpool and last Saturday's 1-1 draw against Bournemouth, which should have been his first home match in charge. McKinlay was close to being appointed Blackburn manager two years ago but Rovers' global adviser Shebby Singh was warned to change his mind by supporters who protested against the plan.","Billy McKinlay will join the Watford backroom staff today .

The show is completely staged; there is nothing real about this reality show.' 'Kris teased Kim a lot, but it was never malicious, and he never resented her. He loved her and still does.

Just as you thought things could not get any worse for Rob Ford, Toronto's crack-smoking mayor was ticketed on Friday night for jaywalking in Vancouver --  the same night video and photos emerged of him allegedly partying and posing for pictures with fans. Canada's most notorious public official was in town for the funeral of former staffer David Price's mother when he was stopped by police for crossing the street on a red light. The Global News reported that the mayor was walking on North Road when he was flagged by an officer outside a Shell gas station. Eyewitness Ian Currie told The Global News that . he overheard the mayor tell police officers: 'I f-ed up, boys... I . thought it was looser on the West Coast, I thoughts you were cooler over . here.' Currie . earlier told The Global News that Mr Ford had told them he was being . ticketed for 'public drunkenness.' He later retracted his statement. Ford's . latest run-in with police drew a sizable crowd in Vancouver, with the . hapless public servant allegedly pleading with onlookers not to take pictures of . him because he is 'going to get in a lot of trouble.' However, Ford, who has been battling drug and alcohol addiction, is also believed to have ducked . into a nearby pub called Foggy Dew earlier in the evening. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Toronto Mayor Rob Ford poses for photos at the Foggy Dew pub in Coquitlam, British Columbia, on Friday night . Various bar attendees took to Twitter, posting messages 'Rob Ford is at the foggy dew' and 'Got hammered with Rob Ford tonight,' The Globe and Mail reports. Witness Michael Spencer told the Toronto Sun that around 8:45pm, he noticed Ford posing for pictures with fans. 'He was there with his friend who was out of the way because everybody wanted to take his picture with him. He was totally cool with it,' Spencer told The Toronto Sun. More trouble: Rob Ford, Toronto's crack-smoking mayor, was ticketed Friday night for jaywalking and public intoxication in Vancouver . Ford has expressed his shock over the ticketing -- and has claimed he was merely on his way to a Chinese restaurant across from his hotel. He also claimed that he only had consumed a Diet Coke that evening. 'I am in shock,' Ford said, according to the Toronto Sun. 'They went out of their way to do this. I said I support you guys. Did you arrest me because I am a Broncos fan?' The incident comes just days after the embattled mayor was named in a lawsuit filed by his sister's ex-boyfriend for allegedly conspiring to have the man beaten in jail to prevent Ford's illicit behaviors from becoming known. A lawsuit submitted Wednesday by Scott MacIntyre alleges the mayor was behind an assault at a Toronto jail in March 2012 that was intended to keep MacIntrye quiet about Ford's abuse of alcohol and drugs. The lawsuit alleges MacIntrye was threatened with 'dire consequences' if he did not remain quiet. He was in jail after being charged with threatening the mayor, for saying he would expose his 'unsavory activities,' the lawsuit says. Rob Ford, accused of planning an attack on his sister's ex, has a history of drug use and tongue slips . Rob Ford may have some secrets he'd do anything to keep quiet . MacIntrye alleges Ford conspired with Payman Aboodowleh, who coached football with Ford, to have one of their former players, who was also in jail at the time, to beat MacIntyre up. Ford and Aboodowleh arranged for staff members at the Metro West Detention Centre to 'ensure 'there was no supervision or surveillance of the area' where the alleged assault occurred, the lawsuit says. Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, said the allegations are 'without fact or foundation.' When questioned further if the mayor had conspired in any way to harm MacIntyre, Morris said, 'The answer is no.' Ford offered no comment when reporters asked him about the lawsuit. The mayor acknowledged last year that he had smoked crack, but he has rebuffed pressure to resign. The lawsuit also names Ontario's Ministry of Correctional Services, which is responsible for the province's jails, Aboodowleh and Aedan Petros, the former football player who MacIntyre alleges attacked him.

"He is best known for playing comic roles of lonely men who are down on their luck. But it seems that Rowan Atkinson appears not to share the same problems as his characters. For the 59-year-old Mr Bean and Blackadder star is now in a relationship with a young comedy actress half his age after leaving his wife of 23 years. Rowan Atkinson, 59, and Louise Ford, 31, have been spotted together several times in recent weeks . A source said they are 'really comfortable with each other' and are spending more and more time together . Atkinson met Louise Ford, 31, when they appeared together last year in the West End as he starred in the comic play Quatermaine’s Terms. Ironically, he was photographed with his wife in one of their last pictures together going for dinner after a performance of the same play. But since then he has been spotted with Miss Ford openly in public and outside her two-bedroom flat in a leafy, affluent suburb in south London. They were seen popping into a garden centre in the leafy London suburb where Miss Ford rents her flat . The star, who is worth £70million, drove Miss Ford away in a relatively modest Audi . The pair seemed comfortable as they went to a local garden centre together last week to buy plants for her rented home that she recently moved into. Atkinson, who is one of Britain’s most wealthy entertainers with a fortune of around £70million, was seen hauling bags of soil while she followed smiling with a box of plants to put into the boot of his car. Neighbours say the comic, who is incredibly private and hardly mentioned his wife and two children Ben, 20, and Lily, 19, during rare interviews, drove to her home in a modest small Audi - rather than one of his fleet of expensive sports cars. Bizarrely, despite moving into a flat around the corner from his wife’s house in West London and his closeness to Miss Ford, he has not taken off his gold wedding ring.

After graduating, she won a place at RADA where she was in the same year and treaded the boards with now Hollywood actress Gemma Arterton.

"Suave Gerard Butler may have starred in his fair share of Hollywood rom-coms – but he is yet to find true love in real life. The Scottish star, who has been linked to some of the world’s most beautiful women, has revealed he has yet to find the one. ‘I have not met the one princess yet,’ said the 44-year-old star of the movie version of The Phantom Of The Opera.

He said other things, such as ‘spirituality, work and adventure’, were equally important. He added: ‘Love is amazing, but it is only one aspect of your life. I hope that when I fall in love, I want to support her and not try to change her. I don’t like conditional love.’ The star, who plays Stoick the Vast in the new animated adventure How To Train Your Dragon 2, said it had made him think again about starting a family. ‘I do want kids. For now I have four nieces. I often wonder what it would be like to share a movie with my kids.

"Photographer to the stars Annie Leibovitz NEVER confirmed a deal to shoot Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's Italian nuptials, it has been revealed. Rapper Kanye, 37, told how he and his new bride spent the first four days of their honeymoon working on a photo entitled 'The Kiss' to be released on Instagram after Annie allegedly pulled out the day before the wedding. Speaking at Cannes Lions festival this week, Kim said the couple had wanted their photos to mirror Leibovitz style - even going as far to touch up the 'off color flowers'.  And Kanye even bizarrely claimed: 'She was afraid of celebrity.' Left in the lurch: Kanye revealed that renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz pulled out of taking the official wedding pictures just one day before the nuptials . Perfect picture: The couple finally released their wedding snap, called the Kiss, four days after their nuptials . However, a source tells . MailOnline that unbeknownst to Kanye, Annie, 64 - who shot the . publicity-savvy pair for their Vogue front cover in April - was never . officially confirmed to shoot the wedding - and the pals are now keen to . move on. The . source, who is close to both Kanye and Annie, said: 'Kanye and Annie’s . representatives were in negotiations for weeks that were not completed . by the time of the wedding.' And . a spokeswoman for Annie told MailOnline today: 'She would have loved to . have taken their wedding portrait and was disappointed it didn’t . happen.' The . source added: 'It was Kanye’s dream to bring together for the wedding . his favorite creatives – Ricardo Tisci on the dress, Vanessa Beecroft on . the experience, and Andrea Bocelli – Kim’s favorite singer singing . Kim’s favorite song as she walked down the aisle. 'The first choice to capture one of the most special days in Kim and Kanye’s life: Annie Leibovitz. 'Annie . wouldn't usually shoot weddings, but Kanye West dreams big. He loves . and respects Annie as a true artist and wanted to bring her eye for . beauty to the imagery of the event. 'Annie and Kanye are good, they'll work together again.' Kanye and Annie Leibovitz then put out a joint statement today, saying: 'Kanye West's comments about Annie Leibovtiz while speaking at the 2014 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival have been taken out of context and sensationalized. 'Although Kanye expressed frustration that he was not able to collaborate with Annie Leibovitz at his recent wedding, he is not assigning blame, and is not accusing Annie in any way. 'Kim and Annie's representatives were in negotiations for weeks that were not completed by the time of the wedding. Annie would have been happy to do the portrait but she was never confirmed.' In the end, the wedding photos were taken by 22-year-old British photographer Conor McDonnell from Liverpool. Stunner: Kim Kardashian, at the MailOnline Boat Party in Cannes, France last night, said that she wanted her wedding photos to mirror Annie Leibowitz' style . In . his Cannes Lions panel with Steve Stoute, tech guru godfather Ben . Horowitz and Bloomberg's Stephanie Ruhle,  Kanye was referencing Annie as an example of how to merge . culture and tech.

Leibovitz’s pictures.The wedding photo is now the most 'liked' photo on Instagram of all time with two million likes. 'Picture . this,' said Kanye. 'The most-liked Instagram photo of all time, shot by . Annie Leibowitz. Oh, I’m sorry for dreaming out loud. Again.' Speaking . at the Cannes Lions festival on Tuesday, Kanye, revealed the renowned .

And for the first time, rapper Kanye has revealed why on a . panel discussion about technology and culture. He . said despite the photographer leaving him and Kim in the lurch, he . wanted his photos look as good as Leibovitz’s because he’s still a . massive fan of hers. Kim Kardashian looked stunning as she stepped out in a long-sleeved, Haute Couture Givenchy by Riccardo Tisci wedding dress.The dress, which was was visible in the couple’s first official photo, The Kiss, looked even more sensational in front of the floor-to-ceiling white flower backdrop.And that was no fluke, either. Mr West revealed at the Cannes Lions festival on Tuesday that the floral wall was created specifically to match Mrs Kardashian West's dress.The custom-made, Givenchy creation hugged her curvy frame perfectly, and featured long lace sleeves with strategic sheer panels. 'Thank you @RiccardoTisci17 for making me the most gorgeous gown I've ever seen! I'm so grateful @givenchyofficial for this Givenchy Couture wedding gown!' she tweeted. Wearing Givenchy proved to be a family affair as both North and Mr West were outfitted by Mr Tisci. North's custom-made, haute couture creation was made to resbemble her mom's dress, while Mr West wore a custom tux. ‘I’ll tell you a little story about the Kiss photo that my girl put up,’ Kanye told a packed audience of hundreds. Wearing a . white collarless Acne shirt, jeans ripped at the left knee, and grey . suede boots, he added: ‘We - and this was p***ing my girl off during the . honeymoon. ‘She . was exhausted because we worked on the photo so much because Annie . Leibovitz pulled out of the wedding, because I think she was scared of . the idea of celebrity. ‘But . because Annie pulled out, I was like “I still want my wedding photos to . look like Annie Leibovitz’s photos” and we sat there and worked on that . photo for four days – because the flowers were off-colour and stuff . like that. ‘Can you . imagine telling someone who wants to just Instagram a photo, who’s the . number one person on Instagram, “We need to work on the colour of the . flower wall”, or the idea that it’s a Givenchy dress, and it’s not about . the name Givenchy, it’s about the talent that is Riccardo Tisci - and . how important Kim is to the internet. ‘And . the fact the number one most-liked photo [on Instagram] has a kind of . aesthetic was a win for what the mission is, which is raising the . palette. ‘It was a long time,’ he added – drawing laughs from the audience.

"Two long-standing political stalwarts who were expected to face defeat in primary elections held on to their seats in a night of unexpected turnarounds yesterday. Six-term Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi edged out tea party-backed challenger Chris McDaniel in a bruising, costly Republican runoff that pitted Washington clout against Tea Party values and an insistence on conservative purity. In New York's Harlem and upper Manhattan, 84-year-old Democratic Representative Charles Rangel, a 22-term congressman and the third-most-senior member of the House, celebrated after leading the vote 47 to 44 per cent - but his challenger refused to concede. Scroll down for video . Victory speech: Six-term Senator Thad Cochran won back the support of his party in Mississippi,  beating out tea-party challenger Chris McDaniel in a primary runoff on Tuesday . Close vote: McDaniels pictured giving his concession speech Tuesday night. The Sarah Palin-supported candidate won the primary in the first round, but didn't secure enough votes to win the nomination outright so it went into a runoff . With 99 per cent of precincts . reporting, Cochran had 51 per cent to McDaniel's 49 per cent, three . weeks after McDaniel had beaten the veteran lawmaker in the initial . primary round but had fallen short of the majority needed for . nomination. In the three-week dash to the runoff, Cochran and his allies . had highlighted his seniority while McDaniel had argued that Cochran . was part of a blight of federal overspending. In . a brief speech, Cochran credited those who helped. 'It's a group . effort, it's not a solo and so we all have a right to be proud of our . state tonight.' McDaniel savaged the Republican party on Tuesday night after his narrow defeat. According to the Huffington Post, he condemned Cochran for courting Democratic voters. He told supporters: '[The GOP] was a party of principle at one point. A party of courage at one point. It was Reagan that said, ''We will be a party of bold colors, not pastels.'' And yet there are millions of people who feel like strangers in their own party.' He continued: 'There is something a bit unusual about a Republican primary that's decided by liberal Democrats. So much for bold colors. So much for principle. I guess they can take some consolation that they did something tonight by once again compromising, by once again reaching against the aisle, by once again abandoning the conservative movement.' The victory for a stalwart of the Senate Appropriations Committee was a fresh blow to the tea party movement, which spent millions to cast aside Cochran, a mainstream Republican who won a U.S. House seat in President Richard Nixon's GOP wave of 1972 and has served in the Senate for more than three decades. In another setback for the tea party, two-term Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma won the GOP nomination in the race to succeed Senator Tom Coburn, who is stepping down with two years left in his term. In the solidly Republican state, Lankford is all but assured of becoming the next senator. Part of the House GOP leadership, Lankford defeated TW Shannon, a member of the Chickasaw Nation and the state's first black House speaker, backed by former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, two stalwarts of the right. Despite Congress' abysmal public approval ratings, incumbents have largely prevailed midway through the primary season — with two notable exceptions. Victory hug: Two-term U.S. Representative James Lankford is embraced by his wife Cindy after securing the Republican party's nomination to run for the Senate . End of the road: Lankford beat out TW Shannon (pictured), a member of the Chickasaw Nation and the state's first black House speaker, who was supported by former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Shannon pictured above giving his concession speech . Little-known college professor Dave Brat knocked out House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in Virginia's Republican primary this month, and Republican Representative Ralph Hall, 91, lost in a Texas runoff to a younger Republican. McDaniel declared as he voted Tuesday, 'We are here, we're going to fight for our belief system no matter what, and we're going to reclaim Washington, DC, one race at a time.' But Cochran and his allies, notably former Governor Haley Barbour, promoted his Washington establishment credentials, focusing on the billions he funneled to his home state, one of the poorest in the nation. In a last-ditch effort, Cochran reached out to traditionally Democratic voters — blacks and union members — who could cast ballots in the runoff. That possible factor in Cochran's victory is sure to be cited by critics in days and weeks to come. In predominantly black neighborhoods of Hattiesburg's south side, an organized effort for Cochran was evident. Ronnie Wilson, a 50-year-old unemployed Hattiesburg man, said he had been encouraged by his pastor to vote for Cochran. Majority wins: Cochran supporters beam with joy at his victory party in Jackson, Mississippi on Tuesday night . Civic duty: McDaniel and his wife Jill vote in the primary race on Tuesday with the help of their patriotically-dressed children . 'They say the other guy is trying to cut food stamps and all that,' Wilson said. 'I'm trying to look after the majority of people not working.' McDaniel had railed against the federal 'spending sprees' by Cochran but his calls to slash the budget unnerved some voters. Frank McCain, a 71-year-old retired tax administrator from Mendenhall, voted for Cochran. 'I believe he is doing a good job,' McCain said. 'But mostly I'm more scared of the other candidate. He wants to do things like not taking school funding when everyone else is.' The Mississippi contest was the marquee race on a busy June primary day that included New York, Oklahoma, Colorado, Maryland and Utah. In a special House election on Florida's Gulf Coast, voters chose Republican businessman Curt Clawson to replace former Representative Trey Radel, who resigned in January after pleading guilty to cocaine possession. In New York's Harlem and upper Manhattan,  84-year-old Democratic Representative Charles Rangel, a 22-term congressman and the third-most-senior member of the House, held a slight edge over state Senator Adriano Espaillat, bidding to become the first Dominican-American member of Congress. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Rangel had 47 per cent of the vote compared to Espaillat's 44 percent, according to the Associated Press. Espaillat has refused to concede with votes still to be counted. Rangel seemed content to celebrate his apparent victory at an election party in East Harlem. According to DNAinfo, he told the crowd: 'I think this election is historic. It shows the changes taking place in America.' Rangel, the face of Harlem politics for generations, raised his arms aloft and smiled. There is not a Republican contender for the seat, all but assuring Rangel's 23rd term in Congress. 'This was your victory,' Rangel told the crowd. 'This is your congressman. And you can rest assured all I will be doing is thinking about you and bringing resources back home.' Rangel wins: Charles Rangel, who has represented New York's Harlem and upper Manhattan in the House of Representatives for 22 terms, won his party's nomination again by beating state Senator Adriano Espaillat in the Tuesday primary. Pictured above at his victory party . His House: 84-year-old Rangel is the third most senior member of the House . Not giving up: Though Rangel led in the polls Tuesday night, Espaillat refused to concede saying the race was too close to call . Rangel, one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus, drew criticism last month when he dismissed the 59-year-old Espaillat as a candidate whose only accomplishment was to be a Dominican in a majority Latino district. Two years ago, Rangel prevailed in the primary by fewer than 1,100 votes. In Mississippi, outside groups, from tea party organizations to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, spent some $12million on the GOP Senate runoff. Former Green Bay Packers quarterback — and Gulfport, Mississippi, native — Brett Favre called the 76-year-old Cochran a 'proven and respected leader' in one Chamber ad. McDaniel, 41, an attorney and former radio host, had the strong backing of Palin and the tea party movement, which saw his political approach as a change from a Washington status quo of mainstream conservatives willing to compromise. Friends in high places: U.S. Senator John McCain supported Cochran in the race. Pictured together at a campaign rally on June 23 . Kellie Phipps, a 42-year-old public school teacher from Taylorsville, voted for McDaniel. 'I think we need some new blood,' Phipps said. In November, Cochran will face Democrat Travis Childers, a former congressman, in the heavily Republican state. In Colorado on Tuesday, former Representative Bob Beauprez won the crowded gubernatorial primary that included 2008 presidential candidate Tom Tancredo, an immigration opponent. That was welcome news to national Republicans who feared that Tancredo could be a drag on the GOP ticket in November. Beauprez will face Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper. In Maryland, Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown won the Democratic primary for governor as the state chose a successor to outgoing Democratic Governor Martin O'Malley, who is considering a 2016 presidential bid. If elected in the Democratic-leaning state, Brown would make history as one of the few African-American governors; Massachusetts' Deval Patrick is retiring. Happy day: Former U.S. Representative Bob Beauprez won the Republican nomination to run for Governor in Colorado, pushing out competitor Tom Tancredo, a 2008 presidential candidate and strong immigration opponent . Bad news: Tancredo, pictured above at an election night gathering, won't be going on to face incumbent Governor John Hickenlooper .","Incumbents and moderates claimed victory in Tuesday's primaries in Mississippi, Oklahoma, New York, Colorado, Maryland and Florida .

"Gary Neville and Paul Scholes are not the kind to blindly toe the party line when it comes to big-money Manchester United signings. The pair of club greats cast doubt on the suitability of Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata when each arrived in consecutive transfer windows. So when both are united in their view that Angel Di Maria is an ideal purchase for Louis van Gaal as he tries to re-energise his team, their words carry value. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Angel Di Maria's career highlights . On his way: Angel Di Maria (right) looks set for a move to Manchester United . Wrong man? For all his talent, the Argentine winger is unlikely to be the answer to United's problems . Neville went on Twitter to affirm ‘Di Maria fits the bill for United 100%…’ while Scholes used his column with the Independent to highlight the Argentine as one of five signings required immediately. Who could argue with players so knowledgeable and forthright in their views? But watching United continue their slump into mediocrity during the 1-1 draw at Sunderland it was clear some rudimental issues need addressing urgently. Di Maria, at only 26 and with a wealth of experience, will bring plenty to United but is he another cherry on top of a cake that is only half-baked? If Van Gaal is to persist with his 3-5-2 formation, significant holes need filling at the foundation of his team: centre back and central midfield. That latter position has been one crying out for serious investment for years, while the former has increased in importance with Van Gaal’s tactical switch and the departure of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand. At the Stadium of Light Phil Jones, Tyler Blackett and Chris Smalling started in defence, with Michael Keane arriving after Smalling’s injury. Wanted: Arturo Vidal (right) could help to fill a void in the centre of United's midfield . Competition: Juan Mata's (centre) spot in the United first team could be under threat with the arrival of Di Maria . Darren Fletcher and Tom Cleverley began in the middle of the park. Just how many Van Gaal would happily field in a team supposedly chasing the Champions League is open to question. Blackett and Keane are two academy graduates aged 20 and 21 who have shown promise through the youth ranks at United. But to thrust responsibility on them during this uncertain period for the club would not be Van Gaal’s preference. Yes the Dutchman is famed for bringing through young talents in a manner that allies United’s history – but not in this band-aid fashion. In 1995/96 when Sir Alex Ferguson won the double with Scholes and Neville and some other decent kids, his central defenders were Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister, aged 30 and 35 respectively. The rapid promotion of Blackett and Keane has been through necessity rather than desire and that is unhealthy. Experience counts in that area of the pitch and without Jonny Evans there is paucity in leadership and organisation. Recruits: Louis van Gaal (centre) is hoping to strengthen his squad before the transfer window close . Mats Hummels would bring those qualities instantly but looks likely to stay at Borussia Dortmund, while Thomas Vermaelen has gone to Barcelona. Marcos Rojo should provide a lift but a defender of presence is desperately needed. If ever Jones and Smalling were to prove worth the hype and combined outlay of £26m it is now. In central midfield, dynamism and a defensive screen has been missing since Roy Keane left. Injuries curtailed Owen Hargreaves and Ferguson never did promote or purchase a player to take the mantle. Manchester City have Fernandinho or Fernando, Chelsea have Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas, Liverpool have Steven Gerrard and now Emre Can. United must go out and put some oil in the engine room. Trust: Van Gaal is giving youth a chance, but has placed a lot of pressure on the likes of Tyler Blackett (above) Bad start: United suffered an opening day Premier League defeat at the hands of Swansea . Stuggle: Van Gaal's side could only manager a 1-1 draw against Sunderland on Sunday . It was interesting Van Gaal elected to namedrop Arturo Vidal when asked about Di Maria post Sunderland. Supporters salivated. The Chilean would add that steel sought for so long. Quite where Di Maria would fit remains to be seen. It could be he plays in one of two midfield roles, it could be Van Gaal disposes with his new system. It appears unlikely Di Maria has been ear-marked for a wing back slot. He was man-of-the-match playing as part of a three-man midfield for Real Madrid in the Champions League final and brings pace, drive, and cutting edge; ingredients absent from United’s performances to date. But his potential £75m move now needs to be part of a spree that ends with at least two arrivals of substance, not just sugar. Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page here. Get him in: Mats Hummels (above) would be an ideal signing for Van Gaal .","Angel Di Maria isn't the ideal purchase for Manchester United .

'Based on our current findings, the list of usernames and passwords that were used to execute the attack was likely collected from a third-party database compromise,' the firm said. 'We have no evidence that they were obtained directly from Yahoo’s systems. 'Our ongoing investigation shows that malicious computer software used the list of usernames and passwords to access Yahoo Mail accounts. 'The information sought in the attack seems to be names and email addresses from the affected accounts’ most recent sent emails.' 'We regret this has happened and want to assure our users that we take the security of their data very seriously.' That could mean hackers were looking for additional email addresses to send spam or scam messages. Yahoo admitted in a blog post on its breach that 'The information sought in the attack seems to be names and email addresses from the affected accounts' most recent sent emails.' By grabbing real names from those sent folders, hackers could try to make bogus messages appear more legitimate to recipients. The bigger danger: access to email accounts could lead to more serious breaches involving banking and shopping sites. That's because many sites use email to reset passwords. Hackers could try logging in to such a site with the Yahoo email address, for instance, and ask that a password reminder be sent by email. Target has revealed that a sales assistant's stolen credentials helped cyber criminals pull off a massive theft of customer data during the Christmas shopping season last year. Around 40 million credit and debit card details and 70 million other private records were stolen by hackers accessing the US retailers' payment system using an unidentified vendor's details. The disclosure of how the criminals were able to pull off the crime comes as U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder confirmed that the Department of Justice was investigating the massive hacking at Target. The breach is the second problem for Yahoo's mail service in two months. In December, the service suffered a multi-day outage that prompted Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer to issue an apology. The company would not comment beyond the information in its blog post. It said it is working with federal law enforcement.","Usernames and passwords of its email customers have been stolen and used to access accounts in a 'coordinated attack'

"Off target: Failed bank boss Sir Fred Goodwin . A damning report into how Royal Bank of Scotland was brought to its knees by a £50billion gamble triggered outrage yesterday after former boss Sir Fred Goodwin escaped any punishment. The long-awaited 450-page report into the bank’s cataclysmic collapse lays bare a catalogue of management incompetence, regulatory failings and disastrous takeover deals which led to the bank’s implosion in 2008. ‘Fred the Shred’ and his colleagues were allowed to run riot because of a ‘light touch’ regulatory regime championed by Labour ministers including current Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, found the report by the Financial Services Authority. The bank was brought to its knees by ‘multiple poor decisions’ and a huge gamble when RBS – as part of a consortium – bought Dutch bank ABN Amro for £50billion in 2007. Despite his pivotal role in the downfall of RBS, Sir Fred, 53, continues to enjoy his gold-plated lifestyle and his knighthood, funded by a £342,500 a year pension. He has not been penalised or prosecuted in any way, despite steering the bank to the brink of collapse. It only survived because of a £45billion bailout by the taxpayer, who still own 83 per cent of the bank. There are fears they may never get all their money back. In the regulator’s report: . ■ Politicians, including Ed Balls and the former Prime Minister Tony Blair, are lambasted for urging the regulator to leave RBS and other banks alone. It says there was political pressures for a ‘light-touch regulatory regime', despite the banking industry having such a vital role in society and the economy; . ■ It is revealed that a year before RBS’s collapse in October 2008, just ‘4.5 people’ at the FSA were in charge of regulating the bank, which the regulator now admits was ‘severely deficient’; . ■ It also says that ‘Sir Fred’s ‘robust and assertive’ management style was flagged as a potential risk as early as 2003; . ■ There are just 13 mentions of Sir Fred’s name in the report, although the FSA insisted yesterday his lawyers had not significantly changed its findings after being given the right to examine them before publication; . ■ It is revealed that at one point, there was just one person responsible for the regulation of RBS’s and Barclays’ investment banking activities, a stance blamed on Labour’s political appetite for minimal regulation; . ■ It says that when RBS bought the Dutch bank, ABN Amro, its research into the deal in 2007 which proved to be disastrous amounted to just ‘two lever arch folders and a CD’; . ■ Sir Fred’s affair with a colleague, which the married father-of-two tried desperately to keep private, was ‘irrelevant to the story of RBS’s failure’, according to the FSA. Sir Fred is unemployed, but has such a super-size pension that he never needs to work again. Lord Oakeshott, the leading LibDem peer, said: ‘Royal Bank of Scotland was a monster – too big to control and to fail, driven by greed and ruled by a tyrant. ‘Reckless train and car drivers go to prison, but Sir Fred goes to the golf course.’ Implications: The FSA report alludes to Sir Fred's infamously aggressive management style, saying his 'perceived dominance' created a risk . To add to the fury of taxpayers, the disgraced Scottish banker also took out a £2.8million tax-free lump sum from his pension before he started receiving it. When Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, was asked by the Daily Mail yesterday if he thought that it was ‘fair’ that Sir Fred has escaped, he replied: ‘No’. He said: ‘Ordinary people… have a right to be absolutely furious.’ The report says there were a number of reasons behind the failure of RBS, which was a relatively small, prudently managed bank before Sir Fred joined. One of the biggest problems was its ‘over-reliance on risky short-term wholesale funding’, which was unsustainable when the credit crunch killed it off. The former Chancellor, Alistair Darling, wrote in his recent autobiography that RBS was just a few hours from collapse when the Government stepped in. RBS also rushed into buying ABN Amro despite knowing little about it. It discovered problems only after it had paid the bill. The report says: ‘The decision to make a bid of this scale on the basis of limited due diligence entailed a degree of risk-taking that can reasonably be criticised as a gamble.’ It adds: ‘Many will find this conclusion [that no director will face sanctions] difficult to accept. Surely someone can and should be held responsible.’ It also alludes to Sir Fred’s infamously aggressive management style, saying his ‘perceived dominance’ created a risk. Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was taking legal advice to see if there is any way Sir Fred and other ex-directors could be penalised, such as being disqualified from company directorships. Roger Lawson, of the Share Soc, which represents individual shareholders, said: ‘The legal framework is totally inadequate. Directors can be totally incompetent and yet still escape any penalty. ‘The shareholders have seen their savings destroyed.’ RBS shares were worth more than £6 in 2007 compared to 20.55p now. Senior Labour politicians including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls were yesterday blamed for their role in the near-collapse of RBS. The Financial Services Authority report reveals how it had come under ‘sustained’ political pressure from the previous Government to spare the City from regulation in the run-up to the banking crisis. The body took the extraordinary step of naming three Labour politicians – former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown as well as Mr Balls. In the frame: The body took the extraordinary step of naming former Labour politicians Gordon Brown (right) and Ed Balls in its report, as well as Tony Blair . The FSA highlighted a series of speeches and comments by the trio warning that any attempt to tighten the rules would have prompted complaints of ‘heavy-handedness’. The watchdog concluded that deficiencies in management, governance and culture were responsible for dragging RBS to the brink of collapse in 2008. The FSA admitted that its own supervision was ‘flawed’, but it said it had come under sustained pressure to protect the City’s status as a financial powerhouse. Revelations: The report also cited how the then FSA chairman wrote to Mr Blair (pictured) The report is an indictment of Labour’s . role in the crisis. Mr Brown and right-hand man Mr Balls have been . criticised for taking responsibility for bank regulation from the Bank . of England and handing it to the FSA in 1997. The report points to a speech made in 2006 by Mr Balls when he was Treasury Secretary in which he said ‘nothing should be done to put at risk a light-touch, risk-based regulatory regime’. The FSA said that, in this context, it was ‘almost certain’ the FSA would have been accused of pursuing a ‘heavy-handed, gold-plating approach which would harm London’s competitiveness’ if it had argued for the tighter banking rules that were put in place after the crisis. The report adds that it responded to the pressure by reassuring Labour politicians that it only employed a handful of staff to supervise major banks. It goes on to cite how then FSA chairman Sir Callum McCarthy wrote to Mr Blair assuring him that the FSA ‘applied to the supervision of its largest banks only a fraction of the resource applied by U.S. regulators to banks of equivalent size and importance’. Prime Minister David Cameron said yesterday that the report was evidence that ‘Labour were to blame for the appalling regulation of RBS’. Tory Party deputy chairman Michael Fallon said: ‘The report exposes how Labour share the blame for the regulatory failures that led to the biggest bank bailout in history. ‘You wouldn’t bring back Fred Goodwin to sort out the banks, so why would you bring back Ed Balls to sort out the economy?’","Bank was brought to its knees by 'multiple poor decisions'

"Emjoyment, pictured, matches job applicants to employers in a similar way to how Tinder matches people to dates . Finding a date and finding a job are two of the trickiest things to do. The Tinder app already removes the hassle from dating by letting users simply click yes or no on other people's profiles - and now a startup has created a similar system for job hunters. Called Emjoyment, employers and applicants can upload their details and search for the right match at the click of a button. Users can either connect to the service using their LinkedIn page, or fill in their profile manually with education and work experience. They can then select whether they’re looking for full or part time work, or internships, as well as the kind of job they’re interested in. At the moment, only employers from a select number of industries have signed up, and it's predominantly U.S-based firms, so the choices are a little limited. Emjoyment users can also state where they currently work, and whether they’d be willing to relocate. Finally, the site asks users to upload their CV before being shown relevant jobs.These preferences can be updated at any time, as can the user’s profile information. Each job vacancy is displayed with the name of the company, the job title and a one-sentence description. Applicants can then click the red 'thumbs down' button to reject a vacancy, or the green 'thumbs up' button to express an interest. Emjoyment users can either connect to the service using their Linkedin page, or fill in their profile manually with education and work experience.

"Theresa May insisted yesterday she did not authorise the publication of her explosive letter to Michael Gove, as she repeatedly stonewalled questions from MPs over how much she knew about the leak. As speculation swirled about the impact of her spat with the Education Secretary on a forthcoming Cabinet reshuffle, Mrs May told MPs that an inquiry by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood had cleared her of releasing the correspondence. The letter, which was published on the Home Office website, dramatically escalated a bitter row between the two ministers over extremism in schools. Home Secretary Theresa May listens to questions from the despatch box, with Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (centre) keeping her away from Cabinet rival Education Secretary Michael Gove (right) Mrs May hit back at criticism of her handling of anti-terror policy, and showed no sign of backing down in her row with Michael Gove . The Home Secretary was asked seven . times by Labour MPs about whether she knew the letter to Mr Gove would . be made public at some point, whether it was written in order to be . leaked, and why there was a three-day delay in removing it from the . website. But she would say only that she had not authorised its release. Labour . claimed the publication of the letter – in which Mrs May demanded to . know what the Education Department had done about warnings of extremism . in Birmingham schools in 2010 – was a breach of ministerial code if it . was authorised by the Home Secretary. Asked . by Labour MP Nic Dakin whether she knew her special adviser Fiona . Cunningham – who was forced to resign at the weekend over the incident – . was going to publish the letter, Mrs May simply insisted it was ‘a bit . rich getting so many questions about special advisers from the party of . Damian McBride’, a reference to Gordon Brown’s disgraced spin doctor. Later, as Mr Gove took questions from the Despatch Box, he found himself sitting next to Mrs May . Labour's Yvette Cooper accused the government of losing control of policy to deal with extremism . Asked . by veteran Dennis Skinner whether she was battling Mr Gove because she . was ‘getting ready for a succession battle’ for the Tory leadership, Mrs . May replied icily: ‘I do not think that question should be dignified . with a response.’ Shadow . home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘The Home Secretary claimed she did . not authorise the release of the letter. Yet time and again she refused . to answer whether she wrote it in order to leak it, who did release it . and why she left it on the Home Office website for three days.’ There . is anger among some Tory ministers that Mr Gove, who started the row by . using lunch with the editor of The Times to attack Mrs May and her . counter-terrorism adviser Charles Farr, has been let off with a slap on . the wrist. Persistent: The Home Secretary, pictured with aide Fiona Cunningham who resigned last week, was asked seven times by Labour MPs about whether she knew the letter to Mr Gove would be made public at some point . David Cameron is . finalising a Government reshuffle which is expected to take place . within the next week. And one Cabinet source said: ‘Michael was on the . move to party chairman – it has certainly been discussed. ‘Now . it looks harder to do it because it would appear like a demotion . because of the row with Theresa. Michael has done this over and over . again – had a row internally and then leaked it – and people are frankly . fed up with it.’ Events last week were 'shambolic for . the Government, but much worse for everyone else' and must not be . repeated, said the shadow home secretary. She . demanded assurances from Mrs May and Mr Gove that they 'will not put . their personal reputations and ambitions ahead of making the right . decisions for the country'. Ms . Cooper asked why Mrs May had allowed her letter to remain on the Home . Office website for three and a half days before it was removed, and . demanded to know: 'Did she write that letter in order for it to be . leaked, and did she authorise its release to the media?' She . asked whether Mrs May stood by her claim in the letter that oversight . arrangements for schools in Birmingham were not 'adequate'. Mr Gove sat just feet away from Mrs May, as she insisted she was in charge efforts to tackle extremism . Mrs Cooper said that the Home Office's strategy on preventing extremism had been 'criticised from all sides, not just by the Education Secretary, for failing to engage with local communities and having become too narrow, leaving gaps.' She added: 'She now needs to focus on getting those policies back on track, because it matters to communities across the country that there's a serious and sensible approach to these issues and joint working at the very top of the Government.' To cheers from the Tory benches, Mrs May retorted: 'We have excluded more hate preachers than any Home Secretary before me. I have got rid of the likes of Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada. 'The Government does not give a public platform to groups that condone or fail to distance themselves from extremism and we are mapping out for the first time extremists and extremist groups in the United Kingdom. We make sure that the groups we work with and fund adhere to British values and where they do not we do not fund them and we do not work with them. 'None of these things was true when the party opposite was in power.' Mrs May called on Ms Cooper to withdraw any allegation that she had breached the ministerial code, saying that the Prime Minister and Sir Jeremy had concluded that she did not. 'Yes, we need to get to the bottom of what has happened in the schools in Birmingham, but it is thanks to this Education Secretary that the Department for Education has for the first time a dedicated extremism unit to try to stop this sort of thing from happening,' said the Home Secretary.","Home Secretary called to the Commons after explosive row over extremism .

"A new book to be released by Dave Berg, longtime producer for 'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,' is pulling no punches in revealing the most memorable hijinks and celebrity diva moments from the show's history. 'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno', which began airing on NBC in 1992, hosted some of the hottest names of Hollywood and current events of the time. The number one late-night talk show for most of its run, Jay Leno's show was the source of numerous pieces of pop-culture history, including Hugh Grant's 1995 public apology for his arrest with a prostitute, Arnold Schwarzenegger's announcement in 2003 that he would be running for Governor of California, and the 2009 appearance of Barack Obama, the first late night talk show appearance by a U.S. President. Jay Leno (pictured left) with his wife Mavis (pictured right.) Leno is the subject of a new book 'Behind the Curtain: An Insider's View of Jay Leno's Tonight Show', which details the behind the scenes hijinks of guests of the show . Front cover of 'Behind the Curtain: An Insider's View of Jay Leno's Tonight Show', written by Dave Berg (pictured right), co-producer of the Tonight Show for 18 years . Berg's new book, 'Behind the Curtain: An Insider’s View of Jay Leno’s Tonight Show', hits shelves on Sunday. The book offers an exclusive look into the history of the show, including which guests were tough to interview or hard to deal with. For starters, the book confirms what most already know: That Christian Bale can be difficult to get along with. In 2002, Bale was scheduled to be a guest on the show, but clashed with Berg in a pre-show interview. 'I had asked him where he grew up (Wales), how big his family was (three . sisters), and what his first gig was (a Pac-Man cereal commercial). [He] didn’t seem to have even a basic understanding of how ‘The Tonight . Show’ worked,' Berg writes. 'I was glad he dropped out, thus averting an . awkward on-air ­exchange with Jay.' According to Berg, Christian Bale abruptly ended a pre-show interview before a Tonight Show appearance . Kobe Bryant never appeared on Leno's show again after Leno made a joke about Bryant's then-fresh sexual assault case . In addition to dealing with stars that couldn't handle an interview with Jay, Berg also recounts how things said on the show or behind the scenes caused some celebrities to boycott the show. According to Berg, Helen Hunt was particularly thin-skinned. After a producer critiqued her performance during an . appearance to promote the then-hit NBC sitcom 'Mad About You,”' she refused to return for 14 . years. Kobe Bryant also boycotted Leno, after Leno made a joke about his rape case. Bryant was accused of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old in 2003. Not that show snubs were a one way street. The book claims that during the O.J. Simpson media spectacle, Leno snubbed Simpson's attorney Johnnie Cochran as a guest. Leno reportedly felt strongly that Simpson had committed the murders. Leno did allow prosecutors Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden to come on. Once on the show, some celebs did not perform quite as expected. The show staff learned in an interview with Jesse Jackson that he had immense stage fright. According to Berg, Jesse Jackson had serious stage fright before his appearance, unable to keep his balance without assistance backstage . Qunetin Tarantino reportedly had too much to drink at the 'Jay Bar' to calm his nerves, resulting in him slurring his words during his interview . 'I never would have guessed that this prominent civil rights activist . and one-time presidential candidate would be a nervous Nellie,' said . Berg, adding 'One time he was shaking so hard backstage, he had to hold onto me . for support..' To help with the pre-show jitters, Leno had 'The Jay Bar' installed, complete with enough beer and wine to loosen up guests. However, some guests like Quentin Tarantino in 2003 took too much advantage of the booze, in Tarantino's case causing him to slur his words on-air. The demands of oft-pampered Hollywood divas frequently annoyed Berg and other producers of the show. Berg claims that when Eddie Murphy showed up for an appearance, he came with an extensive rider to cover the 45 minutes he would be spending at the studio. Included on the rider was '4 Snapple Fruit Punch, 4 Snapple Orangeade, 4 Snapple Grapeade, 4 Dr. Browne’s Cream Soda, 4 Dr. Browne’s Root Beer, Coke in glass bottles, . bananas, cherries, Evian bottled water, Juicy Fruit Gum, Snickers, Milky . Ways, peppermints, York Peppermint Patties, writing pads/pencils/pens, . regular-sized towels, washcloths/small.' For an appearance, Jessica Simpson demanded that the show cover the bill for her hair and makeup, which she said would be approximately $18,000. Leno refused. Video Source NBC . Eddie Murphy (pictured left) demanded a hefty amount of soft drinks and candy from the Tonight Show for his appearance, while the staff did not give into Jessica Simpson's (pictured right) demands for the show to cover her hair and makeup costs . That's not to say that Leno did not sometimes open up the show's wallet for guests. The show paid $35,000 in 2008 to charter a plane for Sarah Palin and her family to fly in from Anchorage, Alaska. To woo an appearance from President Bill Clinton, Berg on behalf of the show sent him a custom-made tandem bicycle as a get-well present after his heart surgery in 2004, which cost $12,000. Clinton sent the bike back, as Hilary Clinton was a senator in New York at the time (and thus could not legally accept the gift.) Another bike was commissioned, which Clinton accepted. However, he still did not come on the show, his aides telling Berg that he 'simply didn’t like Jay’s never-ending Monica Lewinsky jokes.' Barack Obama's 2009 appearance on the Tonight Show marked the first time an active U.S. President had ever been a guest on a late-night TV talk show . Despite being gifted a custom-made bike, President Clinton never made an appearance on the Tonight Show, as he did not like Leno's Lewinsky jokes . According to a study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University, President Clinton was the target of the most amount of jokes told by Jay Leno during his tenure with the Tonight Show, with 4,607 jokes at his expense. Leno also told 454 jokes with Monica Lewinsky as the subject. Other divas grappled with by the Tonight Show included Paula Abdul, who Berg could never be sure would be 'coherent' in interviews, and Dennis Rodman, who was typically late to each of his 28 appearances on the show. Paula Abdul, whom Berg says the Tonight Show would bring on knowing that there existed a possibility of a 'train wreck' Dennis Rodman, who was habitually late to tapings of the Tonight Show. The producers resorted to chartering a plane for Rodman so he would show up on time .","The book 'Behind the Curtain: An Insider’s View of Jay Leno’s Tonight Show' by Dave Berg discusses the celebrity antics that took place during the show's run .

"She's gone to greater lengths than most to find the secret to eternal youth, embarking on torturous diets and extreme beauty treatments to keep the years at bay. But such dedication seems to be taking its toll on Anna Friel who looked startlingly gaunt on the red carpet this week. The 37-year-old actress’s hollow face and painfully thin frame were in stark contrast to the fuller figure and dimpled cheeks she showed off at a film premiere several years ago. Anna Friel looked startlingly gaunt as she arrived at the documentary premiere (right) on Monday compared with the fuller figure and dimples she had at another film premiere in 2005 (left) This week she covered up in a  jumper in the chilly weather to attend a London screening of World Wide Fund For Nature's environmental documentary which she stars in. Earlier this year Miss Friel told how she had adopted a crash diet in a bid to stay youthful-looking, which involved replacing solid food with 12 cups a day of  a cocktail of maple syrup, cayenne pepper and lemon juice. She said: ‘I feel so much better and my skin has really benefited. ‘If you’re vain, as you get older you start thinking, “I’ve got to do everything I can to save my skin”. 'I've tried everything.' Also dubbed a ‘master cleanse’, Miss . Friel was reported to have undergone the diet for two months and would . have been consuming less than 600 calories a day. The actress was attending the screening of the World Wildlife Fund short film that she stars in . Miss Friel, best-known for her roles in Brookside and US TV series Pushing Daisies, has also confessed to having regular £600 ‘vampire’ facials, which involve taking blood from the arm and re-injecting it into areas of the face affected by wrinkles. She also spends another £490 on a . cryoderm treatment which uses a machine shaped like a hairdryer which is . run gently over skin in a massaging motion using a high frequency . electric field which heats the skin, stimulating the production of . collagen and improving muscle tone.

"Cool commuters might like the idea of skateboarding to work. But it can be difficult to balance while carrying a bag full of papers and a precious laptop and skating along busy streets. To solve this problem, one U.S. inventor has come up with a skateboard built for business as it has a handy compartment inside its wooden body to carry all the bits and pieces needed for a day in the office. Scroll down for video . BriefSkate: One inventor in the U.S. has come up with a skateboard built for business as it has a handy compartment inside its wooden body to carry all the bits and pieces needed for a day in the office (pictured) The BriefSkate is currently available custom-made but its creator, Alexei Novitzy is abut to raise money on Kickstarter to build a basic version. The skateboard has a compartment designed to hold keys, mobile phones, folders and even a small laptop. Its compartment measures 18inches (46cm) by 7inches (18cm). The concealed box can be accessed by lifting a lid, or the board, of the skateboard and is lined with shock absorbent foam to protect delicate items. Custom-made versions cost from around £600 ($1,000) but the basic version that will be sold on Kickstarter will cost around £90 ($150). Alexei Novitzky designed the skateboard to hold keys, mobile phones, folders and even a laptop. The storage section of the 'BriefSkate' board is 18inches (46cm) long and 7inches (18cm) wide so that it can be used for carrying day-to-day items while skating along. A layer of shock-absorbent foam lines the compartment to protect fragile belongings placed inside the box. The skateboard looks normal until the lid is lifted up and the box is revealed, which is kept shut by two metal catches, so the contents don’t suddenly fall out. Mr Novitzky, 29, from Florida, came up with the idea for BriefSkate while he was skateboarding from class to class at university with a rucksack on his back. The skateboard looks normal until the rugged 'lid' is lifted up and the container is revealed, which is kept shut by two metal catches so the contents don't suddenly fly out in transit. Here you can see the box element of the board and how it effectively has a double-thickness board . ‘I used to carry a rucksack with me while I did it but I soon became tired doing that for five hours every day and I knew there had to be a solution,’ he said. ‘I thought it would be a good idea if I could put my stuff inside my skateboard and travel around that way. He developed a prototype by fixing a wooden box to an old board and placing another on top, which he attached using a hinge. Now, the designer is custom making longboards for clients at a cost of around £600 ($1,000) although special versions can cost much more. Mr Novitzky said: ‘I took two old skateboards and attached one on top of the other with a hinge, and then made a compartment from a piece of wood, which became my prototype. Mr Novitzky is planning to launch a basic version of his design called BriefSkate (pictured) on crowd funding website Kickstarter next month where he will raise money to use for the manufacturing costs. The basic version of his design is set to sell for around £90 . ‘It was big enough to hold essentials like my calculator, pencil, keys, and phone. ‘I started using it and when I was in a design class the person leading the course said I should get it patented, which I did. ‘I launched my company, Looshes Labs and I now make customised longboards with storage compartments for people.’ He is planning to launch a basic version of his design called BriefSkate on crowd funding website Kickstarter next month where he will raise money to use for the manufacturing costs. The basic version of his design is set to sell for around £90 ($150). ‘Although I don't think the skateboard will replace the rucksack, I think it will work great as an addition,’ Mr Novitzky added.","An inventor from Florida designed the BriefSkate, which has a compartment that is 18inches (46cm) long and 7inches (18cm) wide .

"Thousands of emails have been accidentally deleted due to a Gmail glitch that occurred between between 15 and 22 January, pictured . Thousands of emails have been accidentally deleted due to what's believed to be the second Gmail bug in as many weeks.

Many Gmail users complained they were either locked out of their accounts, couldn’t access the service, or were missing emails, at the end of last week. At 2:12pm on 24 January, Google acknowledged the problem, telling users: 'We're investigating reports of an issue with Gmail. We will provide more information shortly.' Yesterday morning Google sent a service update that read: ‘You may have been impacted by a recent issue in Gmail that inadvertently caused some actions (e.g. delete, report spam) taken while viewing a message to be applied to a different message. ‘The issue occurred between January 15 and January 22 and is now fixed.' During the glitch, whenever a user opened one email and performed a certain action - such as deleting it – Gmail incorrectly applied that action to another email. Similarly, if someone reported a user for spam, the report was sent about a different user. Google said the fault only affected 0.2 per cent of its users and was concentrated on mobile browsers, offline versions of the service, and Gmail on iOS apps.

The bug has been fixed and missing data should be restored, although Google is urging users to check their Trash folders just in case . This latest glitch is believed to be separate from a bug that caused the Gmail outage last week. Hundreds took to Twitter to complain . on Friday after being unable to use the service using the hashtag . #whengmailwasdown. Rival Yahoo tweeted its users several times to tell them Google's service was down on Friday. Marissa Mayer's firm immediately came under fire online for jumping of a rival's technical problems. However, less than an hour later, the tweets were deleted. Yahoo then issued an apology, telling its users 'Earlier today, a tweet . that reflected bad judgment was posted and has been deleted. We . apologise to @Google and the @Gmail team.' The firm said it has fixed the problem and any missing data should have been restored, however, it is still urging all users to check their accounts for any missing emails. ‘We encourage you to check your Trash and Spam folders before February 14, 2014 for any items you did not intend to delete or mark as spam and move them back to your inbox,’ said Google. This latest glitch is believed to be separate from a bug that caused email addresses to be accidentally added to messages. Last week, a Californian user of Microsoft's Hotmail service received thousands of blank emails after the bug automatically inserted his email address into new messages.

"Hoard: Dr Peter Tlusty allegedly kept a huge collection of manipulated pornographic images in his consulting room at a top London surgery . A cosmetic surgeon hoarded a massive collection of explicit pornography in his consultation room – including pictures he had created with faces of patients and nurses pasted on to hardcore images, a tribunal was told. Dr Peter Tlusty, 57, worked in an exclusive practice in Belgravia in central London, and was a specialist in aesthetic procedures such as administering Botox and collagen fillers to private patients. But when his secretive behaviour aroused suspicions, the hearing heard colleagues searched his office and the haul of pornography was discovered, including 16 filing cabinets filled with obscene magazines and folders with hundreds of manipulated images of patients and surgery staff in  X-rated poses. He had also compiled diaries with league tables rating patients and staff on their looks. Dr Tlusty appeared before the General Medical Council (GMC) yesterday accused of misconduct. The hearing was told that Dr Tlusty, who worked at the exclusive Belgravia Surgery near Buckingham Palace, had manipulated one image to make it appear as if the surgery’s receptionist, a nurse and a male patient were having sex. Lewd comments had also been scrawled on them. The doctor, who lives in a £1.5million house near Wandsworth Common in South-West London with his wife and three daughters, had been warned in 2006 about his use of pornography after visiting a website which infected the surgery’s computer system with a virus. One of the partners at the practice, Dr David Parry, emailed colleagues warning them about the virus and said he intended to ask Westminster Primary Care Trust’s IT department to trace its source. Giving evidence at the hearing, Dr . Parry said: ‘Dr Tlusty took me to one side and said he did not want me . to do this as he felt it was probably him, because he had a habit of . viewing what he termed soft pornography sites. ‘I suggested that he should do that in his own time and using his own equipment.’ Exclusive: Dr Tlusty worked at the this clinic in London. He is reported to have compiled lists of good looking patients and staff who went there . Dr . Parry told the hearing he believed Dr Tlusty had stopped watching . pornography at work, but in 2008, after he continued to act . suspiciously, Dr Parry and practice manager Margaret Burton decided to . search the surgeon’s locked consultation room. Dr Parry said they found ‘mounds upon mounds upon mounds of pornography. There was very little clinical material in the room.’ Discovering a drawer full of hundreds of manipulated images of staff and patients, Dr Parry added: ‘That shocked me. The images were pornographic. They were extremely well done but obviously manipulated. ‘The drawer was packed with folders which seemed to contain cut-outs and further images.’ Police officers were called in who then uncovered the full extent of the haul, which included 16 filing cabinets full of pornographic material with 39 files containing X-rated images, 132 adult magazines, a CD of explicit photos and various magazine clippings. When officers opened Dr Tlusty’s desk drawer, they discovered diamorphine – also known as heroin – and other powerful sedatives. Dr Parry told the hearing it was surgery policy not to store drugs on site. A few days later a locum doctor discovered further pornographic photographs and Dr Tlusty’s diaries. It was then found he had written league tables of patients and staff marking their looks out of ten. Paul Ozin, for the GMC, said four diaries were found. ‘They contained a number of narratives, a number of lists in the form that could be described as league tables. He graded a number of individuals with scores out of ten.’ Dr Tlusty, who denies the misconduct charges, could be struck off if they are proved. The hearing continues.

"Smartphones today react to touch, shakes and even our voices, but phones of the future could respond to these motions with touches of their own.

A Microsoft researcher from Beijing is working to develop touchscreens (prototype pictured) that create different, responsive sensations. The examples include a clicking sensation when pressing an on-screen button, and sensing the weight of folders as they’re dragged across a display . Some of the sensations are based on stimulating the skin, while others stimulate muscles, and recent research also found such sensations can help people type faster. Prototype tablet devices, including those developed by Microsoft and Fujitsu, use ultrasound vibrations to mimic a variety of textures. These . vibrations change the friction between the finger and the screen to . trick the brain into thinking it’s plucking a harp, touching the skin of . an alligator, and more. It can also give the sensation of a slippery liquid. Other, similar technologies change the . friction between the finger and the screen using static electricity. Disney Research developed a similar . system in October that uses an algorithm for 2D touchscreens that . modifies the friction between a user's finger and the screen to add . physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at. Fujitsu claims its technology can reproduce edges, ridges, protrusions and bumps as well as other sensations using its technology. ‘The way we design computers today,’ Microsoft researcher Hong Tan said, ‘It would seem that people only use their eyes.’ ‘Sure, we tap on our device screens, slide our fingertips across the glass, and type on on-screen keyboards. ‘Sometimes, we give voice commands and listen back. 'Our phones vibrate when a text arrives, and we feel a rumble from a joystick when we play a video game. ‘But still, it’s almost entirely about the eyes.’ Microsoft researcher Hong Tan believes users ‘have barely begun to engage our other senses, particularly touch’, and she has been working to develop hardware and software to add tactile sensations smartphones and tablets - known as haptic feedback. ‘With sight alone, most people are perfectly fine interacting with computing devices today, but how much more efficiently, how much more enjoyably, can we interact with computers? 'How much more accessible can we make them? We won’t know until this becomes taken for granted.’ Tan previously worked with researchers from Purdue University to develop haptic keyboards. Some of the sensations being developed are based on stimulating the skin, while others stimulate muscles. Recent research also found such sensations can help people type faster. Researchers suggest mimicking the feeling of keys improves the positioning of the fingers and makes typing feel more natural . In the case of vibration feedback, for example, it involves electronic engineering and mechanics, as well as knowledge about human sensitivity to create various vibration frequencies. In the case of haptic keyboards, the key-click feedback actually simulates the feeling of pressing a key. One method being researched includes putting a layer of material under the glass that bends under electric voltage, which, in turn, bends the glass ever so slightly to simulate a key click. Tan’s Human-Computer Interaction group has developed a number of prototypes that produce haptic keyboard feedback. In a recent research paper, Tan and Jin Ryong Kim, a graduate student at Purdue, revealed that haptic keyboards can boost typing speed and accuracy. Fujitsu unveiled a prototype tablet at this year’s Mobile World Congress that uses similar technology. It uses ultrasound vibrations to mimic a variety of textures. These vibrations change the friction between the finger and the screen to trick the brain into thinking it’s touching the skin of an alligator (pictured) and more .

"Crown Prosecution Service lawyers have been given tablet computers riddled with problems in a £5 million deal branded ‘a shambles’. The CPS bought 4,700 of the tablets at £865 each to allow prosecutors to do away with bundles of paper in court. But the devices could not show video evidence, so another £102,000 had to be spent on DVD players. Controversy: The Crown Prosecution Service has spent £5million on tablet computers (file photo) CPS staff complain that the computers are too heavy to hold through long hearings. Prosecutors also say it is harder to flick through documents on the gadgets than in physical folders and that batteries can run out  at crucial moments in trials. Another £1.5 million has been spent on software support and maintenance over the past two years, taking the total bill to more than £5.5 million. Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry, who uncovered the spending spree  in a series of parliamentary questions, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Ministers have inflicted unprecedented cuts and upheaval on the CPS in recent years, and the result appears to be poor decision-making and false economies. ‘If these tablets aren’t even fit for purpose, then that is a shambles.’ A CPS spokesman said: ‘Digital working will eliminate the vast majority of paperwork and the wasted time and expense that comes with it. 'Electronic case files can now be transferred instantly between police, prosecutors and many magistrates’ courts, saving the cost of printing this information and the inconvenience of carrying heavy case files to court. ‘Our tablets enable prosecutors to efficiently present these cases in court. Inevitably some initial investment is needed to modernise the criminal justice system, but the long-term benefits and savings will outweigh this initial cost.’","CPS bought £865 tablet computers but also had to buy DVD players .

"A 26-year-old man has become the second Australian wingsuit diver to die in Europe in a month after smashing in to a moutainside during a jump in the Swiss Alps. Friends said Alex Duncan, from Manly on Sydney's northern beaches, died doing what he loved most after jumping off a cliff on Tuesday. A member of the World Wingsuit League Facebook page confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Duncan died after a flight failed when he went off track during his jump, hitting the rocks of a mountain 300 metres below the peak. The group has posted a tribute to the Sydney man on Thursday morning: 'We are sorry to learn about the tragic death of wingsuit pilot Alex Duncan. Just recently, Alex had entered the international wingsuit scene by publishing videos featuring his hard-core proximity flying. Today he is gone ... our condolences to family and friends of Alex.' Scroll down for video . Alex Duncan has become the second Australian wingsuit diver to die in Europe in a month . Friends said Duncan, from Manly on Sydney's northern beaches, died doing what he loved most . The Australian Base Association president Gary Cunningham told Daily Mail Australia that Duncan's death was 'terrible news' and he didn't know 'what went wrong' surrounding his accident . Duncan was reportedly killed in the rugged region of Valais after jumping from near the summit of the 2243 metre Croix de Fer peak in Switzerland with another diver. The Australian Base Association, which represents wingsuit divers, says the sport is in some ways safer than base jumping, which involves jumping from heights with a parachute. President Gary Cunningham told Daily Mail Australia that Duncan's death was 'terrible news' and he didn't know 'what went wrong' surrounding his accident. 'In his 5 years of BASE jumping I believe he had completed over 550 BASE jumps. In the last couple of years he had really started to excel with his jumping,' Mr Cunningham said. 'In theory, wingsuiting can make jumping safer, because it allows you to fly well away from the cliff. 'But what they're using wingsuits for now is to follow the contour of the terrain down a mountain, they're getting very close and leaving finer margins for error ... some people miscalculate.' Duncan described himself on Facebook as a 'professional Skydiver and BASE jumper with a passion for adventure and flying' and also has personal interest in diving, skateboarding, snowboarding'.

"One of my favourite sayings comes from the legendary French chef Fernand Point. When cooking, he said that you must never forget the mantra: ‘Du beurre! Donnez-moi du beurre! Toujours du beurre!’ These words, taken from his book Ma Gastronomie, mean: ‘Butter! Give me butter! Always butter!’ Simon Hopkinson says there is no substitute for butter, and that a little bit of the spread is essential to his life . Point, who was awarded three Michelin stars for his cooking at La Pyramide restaurant near Lyon after World War I, also once observed that one should ‘never trust a thin chef’. It is for such passionate pronouncements on food that Point is the chef I’d most like to have cook me lunch. I have always known that just a little butter is essential in my life. Delicious to cook with or to eat just as it is, it richly flavours endless dishes. So, what a joy it is to read that, after years of margarine dominating our supermarket shelves, butter is back. Sales have risen by 7 per cent over the past five years, while those of margarine have fallen by 6 per cent. Butter has precious few competitors. It is a unique product, extraordinarily versatile, relatively inexpensive and, even at the lower end of the quality ladder, most acceptable melting on to hot toast or just-boiled new potatoes. My late father, when eating toast for breakfast, would add butter to each ‘bite’ of his toast. Rather than buttering the slice all at once, the first corner would receive a generous smear, then he would eat that and put the slice back down. Having read about half a page of his newspaper — the Daily Mail, as it happens — he would then butter the bit of toast that would form his next bite, applying a little more this time. And so on. Sometimes there would be a ratio of more butter than toast, simply because he loved the taste so much. Dad  was never overweight and lived until  he was 89. Butter has been unfairly demonised and, of course, if you eat too much of it you might become fat. If you eat too much of anything, you may get even fatter. And, furthermore, if you eat too much all the time and sit on your bottom all day, you could get very fat indeed. 'Delicious to cook with or to eat just as it is, it richly flavours endless dishes. So, what a joy it is to read that, after years of margarine dominating our supermarket shelves, butter is back' That little lecture is sharply given, maybe, but the moral is simple: a little bit of butter; not too much. My initiation to the joys of butter began early. At the age of 16, I was taken on as an apprentice during school holidays in the kitchen of La Normandie restaurant, not far from where I grew up in Bury, near Manchester. The French owners, as you might imagine, hailed from Normandy, so butter was a big thing with them and there was a lot of it about. Boxes and boxes were imported from France every two months. And Norman butter it most certainly was, complete with a picture of Le Mont Saint-Michel printed on each wrapper. In those days, the early Seventies, unsalted butter was rare indeed. It seemed so pale in comparison to our more tasty, yellow, salted, branded butters bought from the supermarket. 'When asked whether I would choose best dairy butter over the finest extra virgin olive oil as the preferred grease in my life, then I absolutely know the answer. It will be butter, every time' Yet, I soon came to love its delicacy, with a purity so suited to the rich French cooking I was there to learn. There was no skimping at La Normandie. Each day we would make a quantity of sauce hollandaise — enough to last an evening’s service. The recipe called for ten packets of this beautiful butter. Melted, then clarified to remove the water and milk solids, leaving only butterfat, it would be hand-whisked into 30 egg yolks — already whipped to a thick mousse over a low heat — until the mixture formed a glossy, thick emulsion. For this keen, teenage cook, that hollandaise was my introduction to the magic of butter. As a chef, I am often asked about my preference for one ingredient over another. Such questions can be irritating — surely it depends on the recipe? However, when asked whether I would choose best dairy butter over the finest extra virgin olive oil as the preferred grease in my life, then I absolutely know the answer. It will be butter, every time. And, anyway, we do dairy well in this country, and not much olive oil. I will always want my morning poached egg laid upon a slice of thickly buttered, soft white toast rather than oil-soaked bruschetta. And it is only best butter that makes scrambled eggs taste so good. An omelette without butter is unthinkable. Though a Spanish tortilla made with onions quietly stewed in olive oil may be fabulous when perfectly executed, it will always be a secondary treat compared with onions stewed in butter. Asparagus, too, is glorious eaten warmly buttered. And if I ever found that my Brussels sprouts were shined with olive oil rather than butter, I would regrettably have to shoot the cook. Discreetly, of course. The onions that begin the making of a risotto, I have always believed, should be gently stewed in butter, rather than olive oil. Yet cooking onions in olive oil now seems to be the initial instruction of all risotto recipes. 'I will always want my morning poached egg laid upon a slice of thickly buttered, soft white toast rather than oil-soaked bruschetta. And it is only best butter that makes scrambled eggs taste so good' Why is this? Risotto originated in northern Italy, where butter is the preferred, indigenous fat, so its use is as natural as can be. Frankly, I think that most cooks have simply forgotten how to quietly cook a chopped onion in just butter. A pat of butter in which to scrape the crisp tip of a thin breadstick is essential. Once, in a silly, posh restaurant — and in France, of all places! — a tiny dish of olive oil was offered instead. ‘I don’t know what to do with this,’ I muttered angrily. How did we lose our daily love of butter in the first place? When I was a child, bread always came with butter. But for the past 20 years our supermarkets have been filled with an absurd amount of olive oil and all kinds of TV programmes, books and cookery journalism seemed to omit butter in recipes. Fridges were filled with tubs of  so-called ‘spreadable’ butters blended with olive, sunflower or corn oils. Even the French were doing them — zut alors! For 20 years supermarkets have been filled with an absurd amount of olive oil. Fridges were filled with tubs of 'spreadable' butters blended with olive, sunflower or corn oils. Even the French were doing them - zut alors! I find such butter unpleasant to use on toast as it has an over- emulsified texture. Slimy, almost. It occasionally has its uses in baking, though. This curious stuff is surprisingly good when incorporated into a rich bread dough I make, as it remains soft at room temperature. It keeps bread moist once it is baked. I usually make soft rolls with this sort of dough. But I would only ever think of it as ‘baking butter’, never as something to spread on my toast, thank you very much. Thank goodness that real butter is once again restored to our affections. As with childhood memories of unpasteurised milk in a glass bottle or a lick of thick, pale yellow cream, there is something about a lump of butter cut with a big knife from a block that speaks of special treats. Folded into its hand-wrapped paper package, artisan hand-churned butter seems like a  present bought for oneself. I sometimes wonder just what the first block of my favourite Lurpak butter, churned at the end of the 19th century, tasted like. I imagine it being offered for sale by the farmgate, all cool, pale and creamy, by a kindly Danish farmer’s wife. It almost sounds like a scene from a Grimm’s fairy story — two small children smeared with butter for roasting later, that sort of thing — but I bet it would have been utterly delicious.

"The East Coast prefers Bud Light, and those near the coast are more likely to prefer wine over beer, a new study of America's drinking habits has revealed. Researchers analysed a million tweets to find out which each region prefers. They found tweet preferences for Bud Light were found mainly in the Eastern half of the US, while preferences for Coors Light originate in the Western half, particularly near Colorado and surrounding states. The East Coast prefers Bud Light, and those near the coast are more likely to prefer wine over beer, a new study of America's drinking habits has revealed. Researchers analysed a million tweets to make the finding . One million geotagged tweets (that is, tweets with associated locational data) containing the keywords 'wine,' 'beer,' and a range of top selling or well established 'cheap' brands of predominately light and pale lagers were included in the analysis. The tweets were sent between June 2012 and May 2013 by US residents. Other beer spaces included Miller Lite preferences in the Midwest and Great Plains, and brands like Corona and Dos Equis in the Southern border regions of the US. Most wine-related tweets were sent from the wine-growing regions of Washington, Oregon, and northern and central California. Overall, residents of the eastern and western US coastal regions were more partial to wine (or at least were more likely to tweet about it), while people from several Midwestern states and into Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas were more apt to tweet about beer. University of Kentucky geographers Matthew Zook and Ate Poorthuis analysed over a million tweets to produce the maps for a new book, The Geography of Beer, published by Springer. They say the beer preferences often reflected an areas history. 'The Twitter maps quite accurately reflect various regions’ history and cultural practices surrounding beer production and consumption, and show just how much reality and cyberspace overlap,' said Zook. Beer or wine? The team also analysed what people prefer to drink, and say wine drinkers tend to live near the coast . While the dominance of top-selling Bud Light and Coors Light in the “light beer cyberspace” of Twitter is not surprising, geographic preference for Coors Light in the Western US showcased the overall preferences in certain regional and state markets, the team said.. This regional preference became more prevalent when examining the tweets of beers with smaller market shares, including Busch Light, Yuengling, Grain Belt, and even Sam Adams. Even preference for beer or wine was geographically evident when mapped. Most wine-related tweets were sent from the wine-growing regions of Washington, Oregon, and northern and central California. Overall, residents of the eastern and western US coastal regions were more partial to wine (or at least were more likely to tweet about it), while people from several Midwestern states and into Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas were more apt to tweet about beer. The found smaller beers tended to be very localised in their popularity . Poorthuis said, 'Beer, like many other social practices, may be millenniums old but the socio-spatial practices associated with it – checking into a brewery, posting a review, geotagging a photo – continue to evolve and therefore our approaches to data and research must also evolve to capture these geographies.' These insights into how Americans tweet about their favorite beers are featured in The Geography of Beer edited by Mark Patterson and Nancy Hoalst Pullen. The new book provides an authoritative overview on aspects related to the origin, history and flourishing of beer culture. Beer in ancient Europe, the British IPA and other great beer styles, the biophysical geographies of brewing, and the sustainable trends in the craft beer industry are a few of the topics discussed. Heatmaps of popular beers were also produced to show the popularity . Many beers were, unsurprisingly, most popular in their home areas .","Researchers analysed a million tweets to find what beers people were drinking .
