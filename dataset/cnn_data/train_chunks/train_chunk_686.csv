A 15-year-old girl has run away with a 37-year-old family friend she met at church after the pair left a note professing their love for each other. Emily Lalinsky and Robert Messer left her home in Plymouth Township, Michigan on Sunday and told her mother that they were going on a hiking trip - but the note, which was left behind with their cellphones, revealed they had no intention of coming back. Messer, a recently divorced father-of-one who has known Lalinsky since she was a little girl, had written: 'We are in love and cannot be apart from each other. 'This is sad to us but our love, though . we've had to keep it a secret, has been the best part of both our lives. Please be happy for us.' Scroll down for video . Runaways: 15-year-old Emily Lalinsky, left, vanished from her Michigan home on Sunday with a family friend, 37-year-old Robert Messer (right), after they left a note behind saying they were in love . Lalinksy added: 'You are an amazing and wonderful mother and person. I'm so sorry I hurt you and if there was any other way we would've done it. 'Try not to be sad and don't blame yourself, nothing could be done.' Lalinsky's distraught mother, Lisa Schwartz, wiped away the tears as she said how she felt betrayed by a man who was 'like a brother to me'. She added that the pair, who had met at church, had never showed any signs they had feelings for each other. She said that Messer, who is from South Lyon, has one son and got a divorce last year.

A woman stole a dead mother’s identity to trick her way into Britain - and then defrauded taxpayers out of more than £100,000. Illegal immigrant Catherine Kyie, 33, was jailed for impersonating a mother who died after childbirth to get from Ghana into the UK. A court heard mother-of-three Kyie then claimed family tax credits, child benefit payments and was paid by the NHS over eight years. Jailed: Catherine Kyie, 33 (right) impersonated a mother who died after childbirth to get from Ghana into the UK which allowed fellow Ghanian Kenneth Boateng, 45, (left) to enter the country pretending to be her husband . Kyie pretended to be tragic Joyce Pokuaa - another Ghanaian woman who had married a Dutch man and started their own family. Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said: 'But she died three months after giving birth to her son in 2003.'But it meant she would have been free to travel through Europe because of her marriage. Kyie stole her identity and took on her name.' Kyie then allowed fellow Ghanian Kenneth Boateng, 45, to pretend to be her husband so he could illegally get into Britain in 2005. The couple and their three children lived in Britain claiming state benefits and child tax credits. But Cardiff Crown Court heard they were finally rumbled when relatives of the dead mother’s 10-year-old son wanted him to come to the country. Mr Griffiths said: 'He was unable to travel because it was discovered his passport had been renewed in 2009 by Boateng and a woman claiming to be his mother - although she had been dead for five or six years. 'That passport was eventually found at their home. 'Police also discovered a Dutch identity card and a passport in the name of Joyce Pokuaa but showing Kyie’s photograph.' Smirking: Kyie was imprisoned for 15 months and Boateng (pictured) for 12 months. Both will be automatically deported after serving their sentences . The court heard two of the couple’s three children, aged five, seven and 10, were born in the UK. The ID fraud family lived illegally in Newport, South Wales, for eight years before they were caught. Kyie worked illegally as a cleaner in NHS hospitals and universities, while Boateng worked as a driver and late night security guard. Claire Pickthall, defending Kyie, said: 'It is a serious offence and she accepts her motivation was gain. 'But the gain was only to come to the UK to have a better life for herself and her family - nothing more sinister than that. 'She has worked hard all the time she has been here. 'The mother of three was arrested along with Boateng who at first claimed he had been duped and thought his wife’s name was Joyce. But the couple eventually pleaded guilty to 14 charges of fraud by misrepresentation to enter and remain in the UK illegally. Judge Patrick Murphy told Kyie she was the 'prime mover' in the fraud. He said: 'You obtained benefits through employment and tax benefits to the cost of £104,562. 'The commission of all your offences is based on the identity theft of Joyce Pokuaa by you.' Judge Murphy said Kyie began stealing the dead mother’s identity documents in 2004 - just months after she gave birth to a son and died in Ghana following childbirth complications. He told the pair it was now their children who had become the innocent victims. Judge Murphy told them: 'You took the chance - they will pay the price. 'Possession and use of false identity documnets are serious offences and go to the heart of undermining the immigration processes of this country. 'They deprive others of legal entry to the country and employment and allow false benefits to be maintained at cost to the legitimate British tax payer.' Kyie was imprisoned for 15 months and Boateng for 12 months. Both were told they would be automatically deported after serving their sentences .","Catherine Kyie pretended to be Joyce Pokuaa  who had died after childbirth .

Poppet, the miracle moggy, came out in the wash after hiding in the laundry when owner Laura Gilhome's back was turned. After clambering in among the dirty washing, the seven-week-old found herself stuck in a full cycle, rendering her little body unconscious. Lucky Poppet is back in the arms of six-year-old Megan Gilholme at home in Audenshaw, Greater Manchester after surviving a 50 minute washing cycle at 50 degrees . A neighbour gave Poppet mouth to mouth to help revive her after she fell unconscious in the washing machine . Ms Gilholme, 27, of Audenshaw, Greater Manchester said she only discovered the plight of her miracle moggy when the wash finished and she opened the machine doors. She said: 'I was halfway through putting in a load and she must have jumped into the machine without me knowing. 'I only realised what had happened when the wash had finished and I’d opened the door. 'She was unconscious and my neighbour tried to do mouth to mouth but then we rushed her to the vets. 'There was no response from her and we really thought she had died.' Miracle moggy Poppet has failed to learn her lesson - moments after arriving home with owners Laura and Megan Gilholme, the cheeky kitten jumped straight back in the machine . But vet John Gunn, in nearby Denton, managed to revive Poppet's limp body and helped nurse her back to health. And despite being reunited with Ms Gilholme and her six-year-old daughter Megan, the mischievous kitten showed she has not learned her lesson, jumping straight back into the washer-dryer when she made it home. Ms Gilholme said: 'I really thought that was it and didn’t think she would survive. John really did save her life.' 'The first thing she did when she got home was jump straight into the dryer so we know she’s back to her usual mischievous self.' Vet Mr Gunn said Poppet was an ‘incredibly lucky cat’. 'I really didn’t think she had a hope,' he said. 'I live above the surgery so stayed up with her through the night and kept her in for an extra 48 hours and she was soon eating me out of house and home. 'I think she’s definitely used up one of her nine lives.

Britain is set to send fighter jets to the Middle East and could attack Iranian vessels in the Gulf if Israel launches air strikes, the Daily Mail has learned. David Cameron has been warned that Iran could attack British targets if its nuclear sites come under fire. The National Security Council last week discussed how the UK could respond if there is a fresh war in the Middle East. Options: British ministers say it could send the Royal Navy to the Middle East if war breaks out between Iran and Israel later this year over the former's, heading by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, nuclear ambitions . Separately, the Attorney General has been asked to advise on what action the UK could legally take in the event of an attack. Senior sources say Typhoon and Tornado jets are likely to be sent to al Udeid air base in Qatar to help defend Britain’s Gulf allies against retaliatory attacks by Iran. The RAF would help to protect Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. ‘We are looking at what we and others could do to reassure our Gulf Arab allies that we are on their side,’ a Whitehall official said. The UK’s priority would be to work with the US to keep open the Straits of Hormuz, through which much of the world’s oil passes. The Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence are also drawing up plans for the protection of British bases and embassies in the Middle East and beyond, since intelligence chiefs predict an attack by Iranian-backed terrorists. Security sources say Britain would not be involved in initiating a military attack against Iran. A senior Whitehall source said: ‘This is planning for the day after, not the day before.’ Testing times: The key oil shipping route, the Strait of Hormuz, could be closed by Iran if it is attacked by Israel . British ministers say the deployment of the Royal Navy in the Middle East is just one of the options on their table should war break out . The BBC reports that ministers remain hopeful negotiations can stop Iran building a nuclear bomb and persuade Israel not to carry out a pre-emptive strike. The desire to become involved is due to fears that an attack could trigger a wider war in the Middle East. Britain's pondering comes as Iran made its first move in attempts to gain an edge in nuclear talks with the U.S. and other world powers. It agreed in principle to allow United Nations inspectors to restart probes into a military site suspected of harbouring tests related to atomic weapons. But U.S. officials have shown no willingness to shift into bargaining mode so quickly, setting the stage for possible tense moments after talks today resume in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone. Still, Iran's move raises the pressure on the West for some reciprocal gestures to keep dialogue on track and further highlights Tehran's apparent aims of opening a long give-and-take process over its nuclear ambitions. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will head to China in June to talk about his country's nuclear programme with Chinese President Hu Jintao. He will attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting - a regional security forum of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and which Iran is attending as an observer. The summit will likely be overshadowed by the presence of Ahmadinejad, whose country is at the centre of a standoff with the West over its nuclear programme. Ahmadinejad's visit to China takes on particular significance as China is a veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council and has resisted U.S. demands for sanctions on Iran. China is also a major buyer of Iranian crude oil. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao warned Tehran in January against any effort to acquire nuclear weapons. But Beijing has generally been reticent about publicly warning Iran or even firmly suggesting that Tehran might want to develop the means to develop nuclear weapons. China has repeatedly urged a negotiated solution to the dispute over Tehran's atomic activities, which Western governments say appear aimed at mastering the means to make nuclear weapons. Tehran says those activities are peaceful. A major breakthrough in the impasse was not expected in Baghdad, with officials and experts saying both sides will seek to demonstrate enough progress to keep the process moving forward. That could cool down worries in international markets over possible military action, but reinforce the suspicions of Israeli leaders who claim Iran seeks only to buy time to keep up its production of nuclear fuel. Iran's envoys, meanwhile, promoted the Baghdad talks as an opportunity to set aside past obstacles. Saeed Jalili, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, said: 'That is the basis for the beginning of a new co-operation. We hope talks in Baghdad will be a kind of dialogue that will give shape to such co-operation.' Iran's ambassador to Iraq, Hasan Danaeifar, said the Baghdad talks could be historic. He said: 'Should the talks set a start for a serious, constructive settlement of the issues, it could be a historic meeting for all sides.' A senior Western diplomat in Baghdad said sanctions on Iran's oil exports, set to take effect on July 1, likely pushed Tehran to the bargaining table. He said: 'I don't think the Iranians are coming to these talks because they suddenly changed their minds about anything. They are coming to these talks because sanctions are beginning to bite.' In Iranian terms, that means offering some possible accommodations - such as opening to greater UN inspections. But sticking to its right to enrich uranium as a signatory of UN nuclear treaties. The Baghdad talks, involving the five permanent UN Security Council members plus Germany, could offer a test of how much the U.S. and allies are willing to bend from demands for Iran to halt to all enrichment and instead concentrate on just stopping the highest-grade production. The West and others fear the 20 per cent-level enrichment can be turned quickly into weapons-grade of over 90 per cent. Moving forward: Iran has repeatedly denied it seeks nuclear arms and says its reactors are only for power and medical research . Iran has repeatedly denied it seeks nuclear arms and says its reactors are only for power and medical research. Yesterday, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Iranian scientists had inserted a domestically made fuel rod, which contains pellets of 20 per cent enriched uranium, into the core of a research nuclear reactor in Tehran. The advance would be another step in achieving proficiency in the entire nuclear fuel cycle. Iran said in January it had produced the first nuclear fuel rod, and it had to find a way to make them because Western sanctions prohibit their purchase from foreign markets. Western claims about a clandestine atomic weapons programme have often cited Iran's Parchin military facility, where the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency believes Iran in 2003 ran explosive tests needed to set off a nuclear charge. Iran describes Parchin as a conventional military site. The agency's chief, Yukiya Amano, returned to Vienna yesterday from a one-day trip to Tehran and said an agreement is within reach to give inspectors 'access to sites, scientists and documents it seeks to restart its probe'. Future: Iran said in January it had produced the first nuclear fuel rod, and it had to find a way to make them because Western sanctions prohibit their purchase from foreign markets . He noted that some differences still exist but claimed they 'will not be an obstacle to reach agreement.' He gave no details on the unsettled points or when the pact could be signed. Amano's remarks brought a measured response from Washington and allies. White House press secretary Jay Carney called the announcement a 'step forward' and 'a step in the right direction'. But he stressed that the administration will 'make judgments about Iran's behaviour based on actions, not just promises or agreements'. He added: 'We judge and will judge Iran by its actions. We're not at the stage of negotiating what Iran would get in return for fulfillment of its obligations.' In Germany, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the apparent inspection pact was an 'overdue step in the right direction'. But he added: 'The aim is to make progress not just atmospherically but also on substance.' Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, dismissed it as a 'deception of progress' to stave off international pressure. Suspicions: Britain's pondering comes as Iran made its first move in attempts to gain an edge in nuclear talks with the U.S. and other world powers . He said: 'It looks like the Iranians are trying to reach a technical agreement that will create a deception of progress in talks in order to reduce the pressure ahead of talks tomorrow in Baghdad and postpone harshening of sanctions.' On Monday, the U.S. Senate backed proposals for further sanctions on Iran, including requiring companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges to disclose any Iran-related business. U.S. and European measures already have targeted Iran's oil exports - its chief revenue source - and effectively blocked the country from international banking networks. Even before the meetings begin in Baghdad, expectations were kept in check. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said they will 'not produce a miracle'. 'But everybody is looking for some tangible steps on the basis of reciprocity,' Zebari added, also saying there is consensus in Iran for the first time to reach a diplomatic deal. Mahdi Mohtashami, an analyst and former Iranian foreign ministry official, said 'the two sides should begin with small steps, not big demands, if they are to make any progress'. The U.S. has been vague about its immediate goals, with officials saying the talks will gauge Iran's seriousness and explore elements of a possible agreement. President Barack Obama opposes a near-term military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. He has pressed Israel to give diplomacy and sanctions time to work while insisting that military options are available should talks fail. Republicans have criticised Obama for holding talks with Iran at all.","UK ministers deciding how to act if war breaks out between Israel and Iran .

Dead: Steve Parsons, 48, took a fatal cyanide pill just moments after he was sentenced to spend up to seven years in jail for having sex with a 14-year-old girl . A man who was convicted of having sex with a teenager has taken a fatal overdose of cyanide while in the courtroom just moments after he was sentenced to seven years behind bars. Court staff and his family looked on in horror as Steve Parsons suddenly keeled over and had a deadly seizure. The 48 year old had moments earlier been found guilty of statutory sodomy of a 14-year-old girl. He was about to be jailed for seven until he decided to impose his own death sentence in front of his own family in the Maryville, Missouri courtroom on Thursday. Witnesses said Parsons pretended he was going to be sick, telling court staff: ‘I'm going to throw up.' He walked to a court clerk's table to get a sip of water. At the time the judge was polling the jury after they had reached a guilty verdict after a three day trial in Maryville, Missouri. Parsons took a sip of water and returned to his seat. No one in the court saw him slip a cyanide pill into his mouth, but the well-known business owner suddenly began arching his back and had a seizure. Court staff tried to help Parsons but he went into cardiac arrest on the way to hospital. Well-known: Parsons owned a tire store in the area and would have had to have registered as a sex offender . He was pronounced dead at the  Heartland Regional Medical Center in St. Joseph. A later search of Parsons car revealed a scrap of paper with the name of a chemical company and a phone number. Fox 4 News reports the company confirmed to police that Parsons had placed an order of 100mg of cyanide and had it shipped overnight to his home. Fatal pill: He ordered a 100mg cyanide pill just days before the sentencing . A medical examiner confirmed Parson's death was from cyanide poisoning. Parsons was facing up to seven years in jail after being convicted of statutory sodomy of a teen girl. He would also be on the sex offenders register for life. He was well known in the towns of Maryville and Stanberry as the owner of Parson's Tyre and Service. Gentry County Sheriff Darrin White was in court when Parsons collapsed. He said: ‘It’s not common to see someone just fall over dead in the courtroom even though they’ve just been found guilty of a crime. 'I was quite surprised and disappointed and unhappy and sorry. Sorry for the victim, sorry for her family.' Biggs says he has mixed feelings about Parson’s death. ‘I suspect that it’s just more tragedy on top of tragedy,’ Biggs said.","Steve Parsons, 48, found guilty of having sex with a 14-year-old girl .

Missing: Police are looking for a person Sarai Sierra chatted with on the internet before she vanished . Turkish police are looking for a person who chatted with a New York City mother-of-two on social networking sites before she vanished while travelling alone in the country. Sarai Sierra, 33, has been missing since January 21 when she was supposed to return home to Staten Island from the two-week trip. Turkish police have set up a special unit to find her and her husband and brother have flown to Istanbul to help with the search. A senior police said that Sierra had exchanged messages with a person before she disappeared and police were now trying to trace the man or woman as a possible suspect in her disappearance. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Sierra 'presumably met' the person after she arrived in Istanbul. Friends and Sierra's husband, Steven, earlier referred to a person she had spoken to online. 'I am aware of the gentleman she was speaking . to in the Netherlands,' her husband said before he left for Istanbul. 'He was a tour guide.' Authorities also revealed that Sarai took trips out of Turkey to travel to Amsterdam and Munich during her two-week vacation. They are now trying to establish why the photographer, who had never travelled out of the U.S. before, took the trip. Her husband Steven, from Staten Island, said .

Her husband continued: 'Every day while she was there she pretty much kept in . contact with us, letting us know what she was up to, where she was . going, whether it be through texting or whether it be through video . chat, she was touching base with us.' On Tuesday, Turkish police released security camera footage showing the missing mother at a mall near her hostel hours before she disappeared.

A simple vinegar test slashed cervical cancer death rates by one-third in a remarkable study of 150,000 women in the slums of India, where the disease is the top cancer killer of women. Doctors reported the results Sunday at a cancer conference in Chicago. Experts called the outcome 'amazing' and said this quick, cheap test could save tens of thousands of lives each year in developing countries by spotting early signs of cancer, allowing treatment before it's too late. Usha Devi, one of the women in the study, says it saved her life. Early detection: Using vinegar causes abnormal cells to temporarily change colour. Experts say this type of screening will cut the death rate because cervical cancer will be treated before it is too advanced . Simple: The cheap screening will have the biggest impact in developing countries like India . 'Many women refused to get screened. Some of them died of cancer later,' Devi said. 'Now I feel everyone should get tested. I got my life back because of these tests.' Pap smears and tests for HPV, a virus that causes most cervical cancers, have slashed cases and deaths in the United States. But poor countries can't afford those screening tools. This study tried a test that costs very little and can be done by local people with just two weeks of training and no fancy lab equipment. They swab the cervix with diluted vinegar, which can make abnormal cells briefly change color. This low-tech visual exam cut the cervical cancer death rate by 31 percent, the study found. It could prevent 22,000 deaths in India and 72,600 worldwide each year, researchers estimate. 'That's amazing. That's remarkable. It's a very exciting result,' said Dr. Ted Trimble of the National Cancer Institute in the U.S., the main sponsor of the study. The story of research participant Usha Devi is not an unusual one. Despite having given birth to four children, she had never had a gynecological exam. She had been bleeding heavily for several years, hoping patience and prayers would fix things. 'Everyone said it would go away, and every time I thought about going to the doctor there was either no money or something else would come up,' she said, sitting in a tiny room that serves as bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and living room for her entire family. One day she found a card from health workers trying to convince women to join the study. Devi is in her late 40s and like many poor Indians doesn't know her date of birth. She learned she had advanced cervical cancer. The study paid for surgery to remove her uterus and cervix. The research effort was led by Dr. Surendra Shastri of Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai. India has nearly one-third of the world's cases of cervical cancer — more than 140,000 each year. 'It's just not possible to provide Pap smear screening in developing countries. 'We don't have that kind of money' or the staff or equipment, so a simpler method had to be found, Shastri said. Cancerous cells: This image shows cancerous cells in the cervix at an advanced stage. Scientists say the vinegar test could prevent about 22,000 deaths in India and 72,600 worldwide each year . Starting in 1998, researchers enrolled 75,360 women to be screened every two years with the vinegar test. Another 76,178 women were chosen for a control, or comparison group that just got cancer education at the start of the study and vouchers for a free Pap test — if they could get to the hospital to have one. Women in either group found to have cancer were offered free treatment at the hospital. Still, this quick and free cancer screening was a hard sell in a deeply conservative country where women are subservient and need permission from husbands, fathers or others for even routine decisions. Social workers were sent into the slums to win people over. 'We went to every single house in the neighborhood assigned to us introducing ourselves and asking them to come to our health talks, said one social worker, Vaishnavi Bhagat. 'They used to come out of curiosity, listen to the talk but when we asked them to get screened they would totally refuse. The women were both scared and shy.' One woman who did agree to testing jumped up from the table when she was examined with a speculum. 'She started screaming that we had stolen her kidney,' Bhagat said. Another health worker was beaten by people in the neighborhood when women realized they would have to disrobe to be screened. 'There was a sense of shame about taking their clothes off. A lot of them had their babies at home and had never been to a doctor,' said one health worker, Urmila Hadkar. 'Sometimes just the idea of getting tested for cancer scared them. They would start crying even before being tested.' But screening worked. The quality of screening by health workers was comparable to that of an expert gynecologist, researchers reported. The study was planned for 16 years, but results at 12 years showed lives were saved with the screening. So independent monitors advised offering it to the women in the comparison group. An ethics controversy developed during the study. The U.S. Office for Human Research Protections faulted researchers for not adequately informing participants in the comparison group about Pap tests for screening. A letter from the agency in March indicated officials seemed to accept many of the remedies study leaders had implemented. Others defended the study. 'We looked at the ethics very carefully' and felt them to be sound, and visited the project in India, said Trimble of the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Sandra Swain, a cancer specialist at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, also defended the research. Research: 150,000 women in the slums of India, like this one in the outskirts of Bombay took part in the programme . She is president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the research results were presented at that group's meeting in Chicago on Sunday. 'There really was no wrongdoing there,' she said. 'They have no screening anyway,' so there is no standard of care now. Officials in India already are making plans to expand the vinegar testing to a wider population. Many poor countries can't afford mammograms for breast cancer screening either. The India study also has been testing breast exams by health workers as an alternative. Preliminary results suggest breast cancers are being found at an earlier stage, but it's too soon to know if that will save lives because not enough women have died yet to compare the groups, said Trimble of the National Cancer Institute. More progress against cervical cancer may come from last month's announcement that two companies will drastically lower prices on HPV vaccines for poor countries. Pilot projects will begin in Asia and Africa; the campaign aims to vaccinate more than 30 million girls in more than 40 countries by 2020.","Low-tech test shows up cancerous cells by swabbing cervix with vinegar .

All of the world's biggest passenger aircraft are to have their wings checked after dozens of hairline cracks were discovered in a Qantas Airways plane. The Australian airline said it temporarily grounded one of its A380 superjumbos - made by Airbus - after discovering 36 tiny cracks inside its wings during a maintenance inspection. This morning the European Aviation Safety Agency . (EASA) is believed to have ordered all 68 Airbus A380s currently in operation to have their wings checked. Airbus said the cracks in the UK-built wings pose no threat to safety. A Qantas A380 departing from Adelaide, Australia, in the sunset. This morning it was revealed all A380s currently in service will have their wings checked . The 36 small 'type one' cracks were found during routine checks on the A380 at Sydney's main airport on Monday. The aircraft, which can carry up to 800 passengers, is expected to be back up and running in a week. This particular plane was checked for cracks at the request of Airbus after it flew through severe turbulence on a flight between London and Singapore. Last month cracks were found in the wings of a Singapore Airlines A380, pictured, and one from Qantas . First class travel: Inside the A380's first class cabins. Each plane cost £156m to build and the wings are made in Wales . Stretching out: There are just fourteen berths in the first class section of each A380. The plane can seat up to 853 passengers . * If all seats are in economy class configuration . The minor cracks - no more than two . centimetres long - were discovered on some of the wing rib brackets and were caused by a manufacturing issue and not the turbulence, Qantas . said. The Australian flag carrier said in a statement: . 'This cracking is not related to the turbulence, or specific to Qantas, . but is traced back to a manufacturing issue,' adding that Airbus had . confirmed the cracks had no effect on flight safety. The cracks are similar to those manufacturing defects which were found  on the wing ribs of a Qantas plane damaged following the . disintegration of an engine in midflight in 2010. They are however different to . the 'type two' cracking found on two A380s recently, which led to 20 . of the planes being checked following orders from the EASA. At the time, Australian aircraft engineers called for the planes to be grounded with Steve . Purvinas, secretary of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers . Association, saying: 'We can't continue to gamble with people's lives . and allow those aircraft . to fly around and hope that they make it until their four-yearly . inspection'. The A380 aircraft are in use by Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Air France, Lufthansa, Korean Airlines and China Southern. The planes have been in service for five . years. In . total, 238 of the aircraft have been ordered by 17 airlines worldwide. The aircraft are assembled in Toulouse, but parts are built across Europe, with the wings being built in Broughton, Wales. Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic . Defence & Space Co., declined to comment on the decision to broaden . wing inspections. A spokesman for the European Aviation Safety Agency . (EASA) was not immediately available to comment. Philippa Oldham, Head of Transport at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said in response to EASA’s decision to order Airbus to inspect all A380s for wing cracks : . 'It is welcome that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is calling for checks on all Airbus A380 as safety has to be the biggest priority for all airlines. 'It is important to note that these cracks are very small and will be monitored by the airlines. They are unlikely to affect aircraft operation. 'Airlines approved by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) have very strict regulations and require there to be rigorous inspection procedures so an aircraft would not be allowed to fly unless it was deemed to be fully airworthy by the authority or their delegates.' British Airways is due to take delivery of 12 A380s next year, while the first of Virgin's eight superjumbos will arrive in 2015. Singapore Airlines, one of the carriers that operates A380s in and out of Heathrow airport, was the first airline to take delivery of a superjumbo, with the debut passenger flight taking place in October 2007. Superjumbo services to Heathrow began in March 2008, with Manchester airport services starting in September 2010.","The Australian airline said 36 small cracks pose no threat to safety .

The threat of a huge boycott by customers forced coffee giant Starbucks into paying tax in the UK, Treasury minister Danny Alexander admitted today. After months of HM Revenue and Customs being accused of being too lenient on multi-national firms who find ways to avoid paying tax, the Lib Dem Cabinet minister said the change of heart of 'more of a reflection' of coffee drinkers threatening to take their custom elsewhere. The company, which has paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in the UK over 14 years - and none in the last three - is seeking to deflect a consumer boycott and increased taxman scrutiny by voluntarily increasing the amount it pays. Starbucks has been trading well but pays little in UK tax because of legal accounting techniques . The move comes amid a storm of anger . surrounding the low levels of UK tax paid by Google, Amazon and other . major international corporations. A damning report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee today accuses HM Revenue and Customs of being ‘way too lenient’. Starbucks, which has more than 700 outlets in Britain, has now met with HMRC officials to discuss increasing the amount of tax it pays. Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'The comments by Starbucks this morning where they’ve said they want to come to the Treasury and HMRC to talk about their affairs is perhaps more of a reflection of something quite new which is the consumer pressure that has been put on those companies. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said 'people pressure' forced Starbucks into paying tax in the UK . 'They’ve reported that they’ve had lots of pressures from their customers and that’s a good thing. 'It’s good that the public exercises its rights there but what we can do as a government is put more resources at the disposal of HMRC to make sure they have the ability to get under the skin of what it is that companies and rich individuals too are doing in the tax system.' Currently Starbucks pays a 'royalty fee' to a sister company in Holland for the right to use the Starbucks brand and recipe, allowing it to benefit from the country's tax regime. This legal accounting tactic helped Starbucks sidestep an estimated £5m corporation tax bill last year. A spokeswoman said: 'Starbucks is committed to the UK for the long term and we  have invested more than £200m in our UK business over the past 12 years. Starbucks has complied with all the tax laws in this country but has regretfully not been as profitable as we would have liked. 'We have listened to feedback from our customers and employees, and understand that to maintain and further build public trust we need to do more. 'As part of this we are looking at our tax approach in the UK. The company has been in discussions with HMRC for some time and is also in talks with The Treasury. We will release more details later in the week.' Paid handsomely: UK director John Culver (left) was paid £3.8million over two years and owns £4.7million in shares, while Ex UK boss Cliff Burrows (right) now oversees the firm's Americas operation and has shares worth £7.2million. Mr Osborne is promising that HMRC . will be given an extra £154million over the next two years to help . crack down on tax avoidance. The Treasury forecasts this will claw back . £10billion over the next five years. HMRC’s ‘affluence unit’ will also . recruit 100 extra investigators to clamp down on tax-dodging by the . rich. The Chancellor plans to bolster the . Inland Revenue team that deals with multinationals amid widespread . condemnation of big-name firms like Starbucks, Google and Amazon after . it emerged they pay little or no corporation tax in the UK. Mr . Osborne told BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I think you can do two things. One is you can enforce the taxes we have got and I am going to be . announcing tomorrow extra investment in the part of the Inland Revenue . that tackles tax avoidance by multinational companies. 'Second, . you make sure internationally we have the right rules and it is . actually Britain who has been working with Germany and France to get . those rules on the international table. 'It will be a big priority for the G7, G8, which we host next year. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said HMRC looks 'way too lenient' in dealing with multi-national firms . 'So we are doing those things but let me just say we can't tackle this by pricing Britain out of the world economy. 'If we make our taxes less competitive that will just mean more companies stay out of Britain.' Ministers are privately irritated by the tone of today’s PAC report, which they say ignores recent improvements by HMRC, which has already been given an extra £900million to tackle tax-dodging. The cross-party committee of MPs describes the tactics used by multi-nationals to avoid tax as ‘outrageous’, but ‘widespread’ as a result of lax enforcement. They say the issue accounts for a quarter of the £32billion-a-year tax gap – the difference between the tax HMRC is due and the amount it receives, adding that while the practice of pushing profits overseas into tax havens such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands is legal, it is also ‘immoral’. The committee’s Labour chairman Margaret Hodge said: ‘The inescapable conclusion is that multinationals are using structures and exploiting current tax legislation to move offshore profits that are clearly generated from economic activity in the UK.’ She added: ‘HMRC should be challenging this but its response so far to these big businesses and their aggressive tax-planning has lacked determination and looks way too lenient.’ The report says international firms have ‘an unfair competitive advantage over British businesses which have no choice but to pay their corporation tax’. But Mr Alexander hit back at Ms Hodge: 'I would say to Margaret I welcome what she’s saying this morning, if her party when it was in government  had taken these issues more seriously we’d have a good deal tougher set of rules to be implemented now.' Last month it emerged that Starbucks has been able to pay handsome wages to its most senior staff over the past three years. It was reported that finance chief Troy Alstead, who owns £6.8million of shares, was paid £5.7million, and founder Howard Schultz £33million – he also owns shares, worth £545million. Ex-UK boss Cliff Burrows who now oversees the firm’s Americas operation and has shares worth £7.2million, earned £6.5million. UK director John Culver was paid £3.8million over two years and owns £4.7million in shares. Bosses of Google, Amazon and Starbucks were recently grilled by MPs over how they managed to pay little or no corporation tax on their UK operations. All three denied they were engaged in aggressive tax avoidance. Howard Schultz (left) was paid £33million on top of the £545million worth of shares he already has.  Finance chief Troy Alstead (right), who owns £6.8million of shares, was paid £5.7million .

Horror: The two adults and four children were enjoying a paddle on the first day of a camping holiday in Cornwall's Mawgan Porth when they got caught up in a freak tidal surge . A spokeswoman said: ‘Before the . rescue units arrived on scene, the mother of the family had rescued her . nine-year-old daughter, and a local surfer, in an outstanding effort . against considerable surf and current, rescued a 14-year-old boy. ‘Further out the father had managed . to push his 16-year-old daughter onto a rock but he and his 11-year-old . daughter were swept further out to sea. ‘A rescue swimmer entered the water and reached the 16-year-old girl who was being pounded by waves. ‘Before he brought her back to the . beach she was able to tell her rescuer where her father and sister were . as they could not be seen from the shore. ‘As the rescue swimmer brought the . girl back to safety the Newquay inshore lifeboat rescued the remaining . two casualties who were clinging to rocks in a gully.’ Paramedics from South West Ambulance . assessed the five casualties, who were cold and shaken but did not . require further medical treatment. The mother required no assessment. The family, who are a camping holiday, returned there after being discharged by paramedics.

A pair of Romanian 'rag and bone' men who took a disabled teenager's wheelchair to sell for scrap have been cleared of theft. A court heard Gheorghita Stan and Florin Axima, who dragged 17-year-old Jack Benton's wheelchair into their van after spotting it outside his aunt's home in Watford, thought the chair was being thrown away. In fact, Jack's father had deliberately left it outside the house along with his son's schoolbag ready for him to board a bus to college. Cleared: The Romanian 'rag and bone' men took Jack Benton's wheelchair after spotting it sitting outside the teenager's aunt's house and assuming it was being thrown away . St Albans Magistrates Court was told the teenager suffers from Moebius Syndrome - a rare neurological condition that affects his muscle control and movement. Jack, a student at West Herts College, relies on the wheelchair to help him get around. Stan, 28, and Axima, 36, who trawl the streets for scrap metal, sold the chair as scrap metal to be melted down. The pair, both of Grays, Essex, were arrested on June 7 and charged with theft. Jacqueline Lyon, prosecuting, had told the court that the pair were ‘dishonest’ and should be found guilty of theft. The incident was dishonest according to the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people,' she said. Maria Moody, defending Mr Stan, told the court that he ‘mistakenly believed’ the wheelchair had been abandoned, adding: 'The Crown has failed to establish the element of dishonesty.' Mr Axima’s defence lawyer, Rebecca Filletti, said: 'This was a mistaken but honest belief that this item had been left out to be thrown away.' Magistrate Andrew Zucker said it was ‘clearly very unfortunate that a young teenager’s wheelchair was taken’, but found there was ‘no dishonest intent’. 'Reasonable assumption': Jack Benton's wheelchair had been placed outside his aunt's home in Watford ready for the teenager to board a bus to college (file photo) He told the court the two men had made a ‘reasonable assumption that the wheelchair had been abandoned’ when they took it. Speaking before the court case, Jack’s mother Sophie, 39, said: 'It’s such a low thing to do. 'Taking someone’s transport like that is taking away their freedom - to take someone’s wheelchair is no different to taking a blind person’s dog.' His aunt Louisa Rowe, said: 'We go through this routine every morning. His packed lunch was in his rucksack which was sitting on his chair ready for him to go to college.'","Gheorghita Stan, 28, and Florin Axima, 36, dragged chair into van .

Historians were furious at discovering the protected Neolithic stone at the Brecon Beacons National Park in South Wales had been defaced with spray paint cans.

The iconic 12ft tall standing stone has stood in the Welsh hills since then undamaged - until vandals daubed an enormous smiling face across it.

Legal action: Jack Straw, pictured leaving his London home today, is being sued by a Libyan military commander following allegations he personally permitted the rebel's illegal rendition . Former foreign secretary Jack Straw is facing the prospect of testifying on oath over allegations he permitted the illegal rendition of a Libyan military commander. Lawyers representing Abdel Hakim Belhadj confirmed legal papers have been served on the Labour MP. The move follows reports suggesting that Mr Straw had signed documents that allowed the rebel to be sent back to his homeland in 2004. Mr Belhadj, 45, claims he had been . living in exile in Beijing, China, before being detained with his wife . Fatima while en route to Britain, where they were trying to seek asylum. He alleges they were sent back to Libya - which was under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi - and imprisoned and tortured. The civil action, which is against Mr . Straw personally, seeks to examine his exact role in the rendition and . claim damages from him for the trauma involved. Mr Belhadj's lawyers, Leigh Day & Co, said they sent the MP a letter yesterday asking him to produce a number of documents. They . include papers mentioned in a Sunday Times article which alleged that . Mr Straw signed off the rendition, as well as his diaries, memoirs and . notes from March 2004 onwards. Sami . Al Saadi, who claims to have shared the same fate as fellow Libyan and . Gaddafi opponent Mr Belhadj, is also taking legal action against Mr . Straw. Mr Belhadj, a key military figure in the uprising that toppled Gaddafi last year, is already suing the Foreign Office and MI6. He . alleges that he was tortured by Gaddafi's regime after being rendered . back to Libya via British-controlled Diego Garcia in 2004. The . Metropolitan Police are already investigating the claims. British . ministers have always denied any complicity in rendition or torture. The Sunday Times reported at the weekend that Mr Straw had been confronted about the his alleged role by MI6. Allegations: Abdel Hakim Belhadj suing the former foreign secretary . Sapna Malik, a partner at Leigh Day & Co, said: 'We have said all along that liability must follow the chain of command. 'These latest revelations bring us closer to that goal. If the former foreign secretary does not now own up to his role in this extraordinary affair, he will need to face the prospect of trying to defend his position in court.' Cori Crider, legal director of . Reprieve, said: 'At last it seems we know who signed off Britain’s . involvement in rendition to torture. 'Jack Straw must come clean with Mr . Belhadj, Mr al Saadi and their families. They deserve an apology for the . appalling way they were treated.' She went on: 'It is now also totally . unreasonable for the Government ‘neither to confirm nor deny’ its role . in the al Saadi and Belhadj renditions. 'Yet this is their official position.

CIA bosses copied gadget ideas from James Bond books and films for its own secret agents in the Fifties and Sixties, new research has revealed. In return, the boss of the American secret service may have persuaded author Ian Fleming not to pension off his most famous creation at the height of his popularity. U.S. spy chiefs developed their own version of two Bond devices it had seen, one used by 007 in Goldfinger, the other used by one of his enemies in From Russia With Love. If it's good enough for 007... CIA bosses copied gadget ideas from James Bond books and films for its own secret agents in the Fifties and Sixties, including this tracking device featured in Goldfinger . The first is the pocket size, magnetic tracking device which, in the film, Sean Connery subtly slips into the boot of Goldfinger's Rolls Royce to track him down after their golf match. The second is the spring loaded poison-tipped blades which flick out from the shoes of villainess Rosa Klebb as she tries to stab Bond in From Russia With Love. The revelations come from newly declassified letters between Bond author Ian Fleming and CIA chief Allen Dulles, as well as published interviews with the legendary American spymaster. And it suggests that the Americans successfully managed to produce their own version of Rosa Klebb's blades but were not so successful in making a Goldfinger-style tracking device. Ironically, both were used at the height of the Cold War when there was very little love from Russia towards the West. Spiky: The U.S. foreign intelligence agency also made its own version of the spring loaded poison-tipped blades which flick out from the shoes of villainess Rosa Klebb as she tries to stab Bond in From Russia With Love . The letters and interviews have been analysed by Dr Christopher Moran of the University of Warwick for the specialist publication Journal of Cold War Studies. And they reveal the relationship between Fleming and Dulles mirrored the warm friendship between Bond and his fictional CIA buddy Felix Leiter in many of the books and films. The two got on so well that Dulles even managed to persuade Fleming to use his books to boost the CIA's image around the world, something which was also seen in the films. Pen pals: CIA chief Allen Dulles, left, and James Bond author Ian Fleming, right, regularly communicated by letter, with the writer even telling the spymaster he needed to come up with more gadgets to fight the Russians . Dr Moran said: 'There was a surprising two-way influence between the CIA and the James Bond novels during the Cold War, stemming from the mutual admiration between Allen Dulles and Ian Fleming. 'This ranged from the copying of devices, such as the poison-tipped dagger shoe in From Russia With Love, to the agency using the 007 novels to improve its public profile. 'It's even more striking that this was going on at time when mentioning the CIA was strictly off-limits for the US media and cultural establishment, whereas Fleming, as a British author, could say what he liked. 'For a long time, the James Bond books had a monopoly on the CIA's public image and the agency used this to its advantage.' Fleming and Dulles communicated regularly by letter. Dulles was a fan of the novels and also spoke about them warmly in published interviews with magazines. One letter shows Dulles persuading Fleming not to pension Bond off in 1963, just a year after the release of the first 007 movie, Dr No, had made the character a worldwide sensation. Another has Fleming telling Dulles that the CIA needed to come up with more gadgets and devices if it wanted to take a lead in the Cold War.","CIA chief Allen Dulles and Ian Fleming regularly wrote to each other .

The Maryland Attorney General has been pictured at an underage party where his son and his friends are drinking and dancing shirtless on tables. Doug Gansler, the state's top lawyer and a current gubernatorial candidate, is in hot water over the picture since he has been an outspoken activist against underage drinking. His son Sam and a large group of friends were celebrating their high school graduation at a week-long beach house party in nearby Delaware. Caught in the act: Attorney General Doug Gansler is seen taking a picture with his phone in the middle of a party where recent high school graduates are seen holding SOLO cups . Not only was he present at the party but Mr Gansler was one of the parents who chipped in and paid to rent the beach house for the graduating seniors. In the middle: Gansler faces backlash over the photo because he has been outspoken against underage drinking . The Baltimore Sun obtained a list of rules that the parents gave to the partying teens, saying that there would be no coupling up in the bedrooms and no drinking hard alcohol. 'Assume for purposes of discussion that there was widespread drinking at this party- how is that relevant to me?' he said to The Baltimore Sun. He went on to use the fact that the party- which revelers dubbed 'eviction party' because of the intensity of the partying- took place in Delaware rather . than their home state of Maryland. 'The question is, do I have any moral authority over other people's children at beach week in another state? I say no.' One of the most incriminating photos was found on Instagram, showing the 50-year-old Gansler in the middle of a crowded room of dancing teens, holding up his cell phone as if to take a picture of two bare-chest boys dancing on either side of a teenage girl in a bikini. At a press conference held after the photo became public, Gansler continued to toe the line that he did not know if any illegal drinking was taking place. 'In this case, maybe I should have done something different,' he said according to The Washington Post. Campaigning: Attorney General Doug Gansler is hoping to become the next Democratic mayor of Maryland . 'If I had seen anything that was dangerous or risky... I would have done something about it.' He put up another defense as well, saying that while he did see plenty of teens drinking out of the distinctive red Solo cups- generally associated with beer pong- there was no way of knowing was was inside each cup. 'It could be Kool-Aid instead of beer,' Gansler said on Thursday. He went on to say that it was not his job to stop other people's children from drinking under the state age of 21. Family values: The 'beach week' party was held for his son Sam (right) and their friends who had just graduated from a private prep school called the Landon School in Baltimore . 'My responsibility is only to my child,' he said in an interview with The Sun on Tuesday. 'Everybody has their own moral compass. Mine is to raise my own child."" He said firmly that his son was not drinking.' The issue is particularly poignant for Gansler as he has appeared in public service announcements calling to end underage drinking. 'Parents you're the leading influence on your teens decision not to drink. It’s never too early to talk with your kids about smart ways to say no,' he says to the camera in one of the videos.","Doug Gansler, 50, is the Attorney General for Maryland and he is currently running to be the next Democratic governor of the state .

This year’s Black Friday sales will have Walmart throwing open their doors earlier than ever before. Opening at 8pm on Thanksgiving Day, two hours earlier than last year, the world’s largest retailer says they hope to relieve shoppers’ anxiety while also guaranteeing three of their most popular items for a special one hour. If lined up inside the store between 10pm and 11pm on Thanksgiving day, those three items guaranteed are: an Apple iPad 2 with Wi-Fi for $399 plus a $74 Wal-Mart gift card; an Emerson 32-inch LCD TV for $148, down from the original $228; and an LG Blu-ray Disc player for $38, about half off the original price. Early rush: Walmart plans to open their stores this Black Friday at 8pm this year, their earliest time yet . If those inside during that one-hour window find the product sold out, Wal-Mart will offer a guarantee card for the item. Top items: Guaranteeing to have their top three items in stock, this iPad 2 with Wi-Fi is one of them with an expected sale price of $399 that includes a $74 Wal-Mart gift card . The item must be paid for by midnight and registered online. The product will then be shipped to the store where it was purchased for the customer to pick up before Dec. 25. 'We know it's frustrating for customers to shop on Black Friday and not get the items they want,' said Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer at Wal-Mart's U.S. division. To satisfy customers' demands for coveted items, Wal-Mart 'bought very deep' on products that matter to its customers, he said. Mr MacNaughton declined to offer . details but he told reporters on Wednesday the discounter is offering . sharper discounts and broader, deeper assortments for the kickoff and . the rest of the season compared to years past. For example, Wal-Mart . doubled the number of tablet computers it's bringing in for the winter . holidays. The . stepped-up strategy comes as Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., is . counting on keeping its momentum going at its U.S. business, which . started roaring back late last year after struggling during a more than . two-year slump. Steals: An Emerson 32-inch LCD TV, pictured, has been marked down to $148 from $228 . Half-priced: Also making one of the three top items is this LG Blu-ray Disc player on sale for $38, about half off the original price . It's critical for the holiday shopping season, which accounts for as much as 40 per cent of a retailer's annual sales. Wal-Mart's strategy raises the competitive stakes for the start of the holiday season. American retailers have increasingly . expanded their hours on Black Friday to get ahead of the competition, . but now the kickoff is creeping earlier into Thanksgiving Day. Starting with the 8 pm sale on . Thanksgiving, Wal-Mart will have two more rounds of sales that will also . include a consumer electronics sale two hours later and a sale at 5 am . on Friday. Last year, Target, Best Buy, Macy's and Kohl's were closed on Thanksgiving and kicked off Black Friday sales at the stroke of midnight, their earliest starts ever. Best Buy Co Inc, Macy's and Kohl's all plan to open at midnight again, while Target has not given its plans yet. Outlook: Seen lined up outside a Walmart store on Black Friday in 2008, the store expects their one-hour guarantee of select items will alleviate some shoppers stress . Guaranteed: If those inside during their one-hour window find the product sold out, some shoppers seen waiting to enter the store in 2008, Wal-Mart says they will offer a guarantee card for the item . Sears Holdings Corp's (SHLD.O) Sears and Kmart stores will be open on Thanksgiving Day. Last year, Sears kept its discount chain Kmart open on Thanksgiving but the Sears chain was closed. This year, Sears stores will open at 8 pm on Thanksgiving Day and stay open overnight until 10 pm on Black Friday. Kmart has been open on Thanksgiving for the last 21 years. In 2011, Walmart began with deals on toys, home items and clothing at 10 pm on Thanksgiving, followed by electronics deals at midnight and other offers at 8 am on Friday, November 25. Most Walmart stores will be open on Thanksgiving, unless they are required to close by local or state law. Walmart has faced protests in various U.S. cities lately and some workers have planned to walk off the job on Black Friday. Such actions are being sponsored by groups including a contingent of workers called OUR Walmart that receives union support.","One hour special: Guests lined inside the store between 10-11pm guaranteed store's top three items .

Dani St James, left, was born Daniel, right, and began her full transition to become a women three years ago . Dani, from Barry, South Wales, is now competing alongside 11 other contestants in the beauty pageant which takes place in London on Saturday. For just three years ago, Dani was a man called Daniel, it wasn't until she was 18 that she made the decision to leave her life as a man behind and embrace life as a woman. But Dani, a manager at a nightclub in Camden, admits that while she didn't leave her male life behind until she was 18, the transition from man to woman began at an early age. Dani, who has already been crowned Miss Tourmaline (right), hopes to be crowned Miss Diamond Queen 2013, and to inspire others who are transgender to express themselves freely .

Dani . visited a doctor in Ibiza who prescribed her with female hormones, she . changed her name from Daniel to Dani, began her life as a woman and . hasn't looked back since. Unlike . many people diagnosed as transgender, Dani said she didn't face the . same gender struggle, she didn't feel like a girl trapped in a boy's . body as she was never forced to identify with one gender. Aged 18 Dani visited a doctor in Ibiza who prescribed her with female hormones. It was then that she changed her name from Daniel to Dani and began in earnest her life as a woman . Dani was encouraged by her mother Sue to act and do whatever made her happy regardless of whether her behaviour was considered characteristically male or female. And Dani said it was the support of her family which enabled her to be confident in her her own skin. 'Becoming a woman has never been an issue as my family have always been extremely supportive. 'I never had any drama surrounding my gender, I was accepted for who I was and I never felt as though I was trapped because I was always free to dress and act as I pleased. 'I was never bullied for wearing make-up probably because I was confident and happy in my own skin. 'I told my mum that I was taking female hormones when I was 18 and it wasn't a big deal because I'd already been wearing make-up and dressing like a female, hormones were the next natural step. 'I keep a photo of myself as Daniel in my purse, it makes me feel proud to see how far I've come. Dani says it was the support of her family which enabled her to be confident in her her own skin . 'At the moment I'm focusing on laser hair removal. There are lots of ways I could enhance my appearance as a woman but at the moment I'm happy with the way I look. 'I don't hide the fact I'm transgender but I'd prefer to be identified as a woman, I take offence if people notice. 'I'm lucky that I have quite feminine features, so most people never guess I'm transgender. ""There are many people who go through with the sex change and I'd never say never but I can't see it in my future. I don't feel like I need to have it to be myself.' Dani said taking part in the beauty pageant was not only a big step for her but an opportunity to inspire others. 'If I'd continued my life as a gay man I wouldn't have the life I have now.' She said she hoped the pageant would help dispel stereotypes and encourage other transgender people to have the courage to live and act how they feel most comfortable. She said: 'If someone had told me three or four years ago I'd be competing in a beauty pageant I'd never have believed them. 'But the closer we get to the event the more I realise how important this could be, how acting as a face for transgender could help so many people. 'I get so many message from people, mainly young boys who want tips on how to look more feminine, or some from men older than me asking for advice. 'I feel very lucky, some people have had to hide it their whole life, some men have even been married with children before they've decided to live their life as a woman. 'I take a lot of pride in the fact I was never scared, of course there were awkward moments but because I was confident in myself I was never bullied at school and I was always accepted for how I was. 'Taking part in the beauty pageant is a big deal, I want to help others and inspire them to have the courage to live as they want to. 'I am very proud of who I am and I'm happy to discuss it, I feel lucky because what I am has propelled me into a life I never would have dreamed of.

The woman who has accused Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov of assault and kidnapping her told reporters on Thursday that he laughed as he beat her at their Denver apartment. Russian native Evgeniya Vavrinyuk, 24, who spoke through an interpreter, said Varlamov had been drinking for more than 12 hours before he attacked her. ‘He was having fun, he was laughing,’ said the model. ‘He has no concept of when to stop drinking, and when he drinks he turns into an animal.’ Scroll down for video . Evgeniya Vavrinyuk told investigators that Varlamov kicked her in the chest, knocking her down, and stomped on her chest as she lay on the ground in her apartment on Monday, according to an arrest affidavit . Semyon Varlamov, 25, starting goaltender for the Colorado Avalanche, appeared in court on Thursday on kidnapping and assault charges in a domestic incident involving his girlfriend . Vavrinyuk had been dating Varlamov for a year. He has been arrested for allegedly beating up his on-again, off-again . model girlfriend in what authorities are calling a domestic violence . incident. She described in court how her 6-foot-2, 209-pound goalie . boyfriend kicked her in the chest and stomped on her as she lay on the ground, before he dragged her by her hair from their bedroom in the early hours of Monday morning. She pointed to her chest, arms, stomach, neck and head - places she said she are bruised. She also said he kicked her out of the apartment, reports The Denver Post. Vavrinyuk admitted it wasn't the first time that her boyfriend had hurt her, but throwing her out on the street was ‘the final straw.’ A judge set Varlamov's bond at $5,000 and issued a restraining order for his girlfriend . Beauty and the 'Beast': Varlamov's on-again, off-again girlfriend, identified in multiple media accounts as Russian model Evgenia Vavrinyuk (right) accused the NHL star of dragging her by the hair, pushing her to the floor and stomping on her in a drunken rage . ‘She . wants to make sure he is punished for this,’ Vavrinyuk said through . Diana Senova, an interpreter and the fiancee of her attorney, Robert . Abrams. ‘(Varlamov) is . very arrogant and thinks he can get away with anything, that he can beat . her up and no one will ever know about it.’ She . said her boyfriend had beat her at least four times before in other . countries, but she had remained hopeful that he could change, as she . loved him and wanted to have children with him. She . said she broke a modeling contract in Hong Kong so she could come to . Denver to be with him ‘because he asked her to,’ Senova said. Varlamov, . 25, turned himself into police on Wednesday evening, after practicing . with the team that day. He was arrested on suspicion of second-degree . kidnapping and third-degree assault. According to news reports, Varlamov and Vavrinyuk, known to her friends as ‘Evie,’ have been in a rocky four-term relationship disrupted by breakups. Vague: John Rotole, the attorney for Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov, told reports that he will defend his client in court . His agent, Paul Theofanous, said Varlamov ‘is completely innocent of all of these charges.’ The . Avalanche said in a statement they were aware of the allegations but . wouldn’t comment further until the conclusion of the investigation. Acquired . from Washington in a 2011 trade, Varlamov is 7-1 this season with a . 1.76 goals-against average. Last year, the goaltender earned $3million. According to court documents made public on Thursday, Varlamov then told her in Russian that 'if this were Russia, he would have beaten her more,' The NHL star appeared in a Denver courtroom on Thursday dressed in an orange jail garb. A judge set his bond at $5,000 and issued a restraining order for his girlfriend. Varlamov also was given permission to travel with his team. If convicted, Varlamov could face two to six years in prison. The alleged lovers' quarrel took placed on Monday at the couple’s apartment in the 1700 block of Bassett Street in Denver. Varlamov’s arrest warrant and affidavit state that the 25-year-old athlete held his girlfriend’s face to the floor, grabbed her by her arms and shook her before pushing her down to the floor. 'Her statement is that this is the most minor of the beatings she received. She's received five in all, and the last one was to unconsciousness,' said Vavrinyuk's attorney Robert Abrams. Abrams said his client spent five hours in a hospital after Monday's beating. Rocky relationship: Varlamov, pictured left in his Washington Capitals days, has been dating Vavrinyuk (right) for the past four years, during which time according to her lawyer he had attacked her five times . ‘This time Evie said to us, “That’s it, go lock him up,”’ Abrams said. ‘This girl is 5-foot-3, 100-and-nothing pounds; he’s a 6-foot-2, 210-pound professional athlete. This is a very sizable force approaching you. This is terrifying.’ Varlamov’s father, Alexander, downplayed the domestic violence case and came to his son's defense in an interview with Russia's R-Sport. 'I can only say one thing with complete responsibility: No crime has been committed whatsoever,' he stated, adding that his son has ‘no serious issues.’ It has been widely speculated that Varlamov is expected to be invited as the starting goalie for the Russian Olympic team during the Winter Games in Sochi next year. In light of his arrest, some Russian officials wasted no time accusing the United State of sabotage. Stunner: The Russian model told police in Denver that her boyfriend struck her in the chest and warned her in Russian that were they back home, he would have given her a harsher beating . State Duma deputy Igor Ananskikh, a member of the nationalist LDPR party, called Varlamov's arrest a 'sports and political move.' ‘The main goal is to suspend him from training and games so that he loses practice and misses the Olympics,’ said Ananskikh. The LDPR member has vowed to use his sway as the head of the Russian parliament's physical training and sports committee to 'influence the situation.' According to the Russian tabloid Dni.ru, Varlamov and the blonde fashion model called it quits at least once before, but the woman, who resides mostly in Russia, returned to Denver for a three-month stay and moved back in with him. In response to Varlamov's arrest, the model wrote on her Russian social media account VKontakte, which has since been deleted: 'If a man has raised his hand against a woman - he will do it again. And no amount of oaths and assurances should shake a woman's resolve.’ Rising star: Varlamov is among the NHL leaders in goals-against, wins and save percentage . She went on saying: ‘Break up with these men instead of feeling sorry for them!' According to the hockey player's father, his son's only crime was that he decided to take his girlfriend out to the movies ‘against her will,’ and she rushed to press charges against him, Russian Gazette reported. Conspiracy theory: State Duma deputy Igor Ananskikh claims that Varlamov's arrest is an act of sabotage ahead of the Winter Olympics . The Avalanche play at Dallas Friday night and Varlamov was scheduled to start. His backup, Jean-Sebastien Giguere, has been just as good in net, recording two shutouts. Varlamov is in the midst of a resurgent season under new coach Patrick Roy and a staff that includes goalie guru Francois Allaire, who once mentored Roy and Giguere. Between Roy and Allaire, they’ve restored Varlamov’s confidence a year after he allowed three goals a game. Varlamov said he credits his improvement to Allaire altering his form in goal. Just minor tweaks, he said, but wouldn’t elaborate on the specifics of what they were. Whatever was changed, it has been paying off as he’s among the NHL leaders in goals-against, wins and save percentage. After practice Wednesday, Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson said it was ‘pretty cool to see Varly transition into an elite NHL goalie.’","Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov, 25, is facing second-degree kidnapping and third-degree assault charges .

In jail for late library books: Jory Enck was locked up after he failed to return a study guide he borrowed in 2010 . They take law breaking seriously in the town of Copperas Cove, Texas, where police are regularly arresting people who do not return their library books on time. The latest to be locked up for the offence had a book checked out for three years. Jory Enck was booked into jail for overdue library materials. Court documents show he checked out a study guide in 2010 and didn't respond to attempts from the library to get the book back. City of Copperas Cove Municipal Judge Bill Price said the patrons are usually released on a £150 ($240) bond after the arrest. Library policies show the patron must have the overdue book checked out for a minimum of 90 days and not respond to phone calls or emails from the library about the book before the municipal court is notified. Julie Lehmann with the Copperas Cove Police Department said if an officer makes a routine stop or encounters a patron with an active overdue library materials warrant on a call they will make the arrest. Judge Price said in situations where library materials are not returned they usually try to let the civil process sort it out and if that doesn't work a warrant is issued, which doesn't result in a pleasant response from patrons. Judge Price said: 'Universal hatred, nobody wants to get arrested over a library book. 'The other side of that is people that go to our library and can't have these materials, they're put out too.'

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 09:55 EST, 1 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:55 EST, 1 November 2013 . Ronald Phillips is a death row inmate who raped and killed a three-year-old girl . An Ohio death row inmate sentenced to die for raping and killing a three-year-old girl is expected to testify at a hearing in federal court today as his lawyers challenge the state's new, never-tried lethal injection system. Attorneys for condemned killer Ronald Phillips want a federal judge to delay Phillips' Nov. 14 execution while they gather evidence as part of their lawsuit against the two-drug process. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction announced a new execution policy last month and said on Monday that it would use that system's second option: a combination of a sedative and painkiller never tried before in a U.S. execution. Phillips' attorneys say the department's announcements came too close to the execution date to allow a meaningful challenge. The state says nothing is substantially different about the new system. Judge Gregory Frost originally granted Phillips permission to testify in person, then switched to the video testimony when it was clear courtroom technology could handle the unusual arrangement. There are no recent examples of Ohio death row inmates testifying in person or by video in federal court cases. The hearing today began by focusing on the state's decision to allow the prisons' director or death house warden to delegate responsibility for changes in the execution process. That could include any deviation from the policy, down to paperwork documenting a particular step. Ohio has walked away from that promise with the new policies, Allen Bohnert, an attorney for Phillips, told the judge. 'Close enough for government work is not acceptable in applying this death penalty protocol', Bohnert said. Phillips will be injected with a never before used combination of an intravenous combination of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller . An attorney for the state said Ohio is committed to carrying out the execution in a humane, dignified and constitutional manner and understands that commitment. 'The state will do what the state says it will do,' said Christopher Conomy, an assistant Ohio attorney general. Phillips' attorneys are also challenging the state's new policy for the lethal drugs it will use. The state's first choice is a specialty dose of pentobarbital mixed by a compounding pharmacy. If that can't be obtained - as in the case of Phillips' execution - the state will use a new, two-drug method to put Phillips to death. Phillips' lawyers argue in court filings that the two drugs could cause severe side effects, including painful vomiting. Those drugs Ohio is proposing to use on Phillips will cause him to stop breathing within a few minutes, an anesthesiologist said in a statement Thursday as part of a filing by the state in support of the new method. Irreversible brain and heart damage will follow and the inmate will die a few minutes later, according to University of Massachusetts doctor Mark Dershwitz. The drugs are midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller.","Ronald Phillips is due to be executed on Nov. 14 but his attorneys want it delayed while they gather evidence for lawsuit over two-drug process .

'The first vehicle broke down. The second returned to Arlit to get a spare part after getting all the migrants it was carrying to alight, but it too broke down,' said the source. 'We think that the migrants were in the desert for seven days and on the fifth day, they began to leave the broken down vehicle in search of a well,' said the source.

Azaoua Mamane, who works for the non-governmental organisation Synergie in Arlit, said the group left behind consisted of 'entire families, including many children and women, who departed for Algeria, where they hoped to beg for their keep'. Niger is one of the world's poorest countries and has been hit by successive food crises. Libya, rather than Algeria, is more frequently the favoured country of transit for west Africans making the journey across the continent, many of whom aim to travel on to Europe. The UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that at least 30,000 economic migrants passed through Agadez, northern Niger's largest city, between March and August of this year. These migrants often look to Europe as their final destination, a security source told AFP, and use Libya as a jumping off point amid the relative chaos in the North African country since the fall of Moamer Kadhafi in 2011. Humanitarian agencies say nearly 20,000 migrants have perished while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea into Europe over the past 20 years. The death of more than 300 Africans in a shipwreck off the Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month has recently pushed the issue to the top of Europe's political agenda.","The bodies of 92 migrants have now been discovered, official said .

A surveillance plane carrying 30 US and British military personnel is stranded in Siberia after making an 'emergency landing'. The US government Boeing aircraft, which was conducting surveillance work over Russia, was forced to land in Chita, near Mongolia, due to fog at their destination. Dozens of military staff are now stuck at the airport as the plane has been barred from taking off due to a bizarre and unprecedented dispute over airport fees. Stranded in Siberia: The US government airplane is stuck at the airport after a row over fuel and service bills . ‘The plane will not leave Chita until the crew pays the technical service and refuelling bills,’ said Alexei Turskov, of Chita airport according to The Siberian Times. ‘All the computation documents have been sent to Moscow and it won't be allowed to take off until the bills for services and fuels are repaid.’ Russian news agency Itar-Tass said the Boeing made an ‘emergency landing’ in Chita after being refused its scheduled stop in Ulan-Ude, another Siberian airport, due to thick fog. The plane landed on early Thursday and is not expected to be allowed to leave immediately. A total of 30 people including the crew are staying aboard the jet, said Russian officials. ‘We satisfied some of their requests and provided a room and hot meals for them,’ said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Kotelnikov.  ‘They spent the night on the airport compound.’ Some of the crew - which may have included personnel with high security rankings - are understood to have remained on the plane, while others left the aircraft to use facilities supplied on ‘humanitarian grounds’ by the Russians. The dispute over airport fees appears unprecedented on such a flight. A RIA Novosti report said the crew of the Boeing aircraft were undergoing migration and border control. Foreign observation planes flying over Russia have the right to land at only two airports in the country: one in Moscow Region, and one outside the Siberian city of Ulan Ude, said the news agency. There was no immediate comment from the US or British authorities.","US government Boeing stranded in east Russia after emergency landing .

Lured to a Washington, DC neighborhood by police reports of a violent home invasion, a news team looking for information wound up getting pepper sprayed by a furious resident. Reporter for WUSA Bruce Johnson and photographer Danielle Gill went to a house in the city’s Southeast quadrant on Wednesday to cover a hostage situation and assault that reportedly occurred around 2am. As they spoke with neighbors, a woman watched them from a second floor window of the house in question. When she asked them to leave and they didn’t, she became livid. Scroll down for video... 'Bye!' From the second floor window, this woman demanded a news crew leave her home, which had previously been the scene of a violent home invasion . No joke: When the crew doesn't leave, the woman appears at the door and shoots pepper spray at them . ‘Goodbye,’ the unidentified woman screamed down from her window. Johnson responded that they were on a public street and not her property, meaning she had no authority to make them go. In a later segment on WUSA, Johnson hypothesizes that the young woman had been one of the eight people held hostage the night before when armed men entered the home, assaulting three of them. One man reportedly had a broomstick shoved into his mouth. 'I asked you to leave!' The crew reminded her they were on a public sidewalk, but that wasn't good enough for her . Victim? Reporter Bruce Johnson concedes he doesn't know who the woman is, but says it's possible she was one of the victims from the previous night's kidnapping and assault reported in the home . 'Don't touch me!': Eventually she is up in the faces of the news crew and threatening them over and over again. Finally, she knocks over their camera . Whatever the reason, Johnson said, ‘Obviously this woman is under a lot of stress.’ And she took it out on the reporters. ‘I asked you to leave,’ she screamed as she appeared at her front door, spraying a stream of pepper spray at them and directly toward the camera. Meanwhile, a stream of expletives come from the woman’s mouth. ‘I’m gonna taze you’re a** next time, I’m telling you bye.’ Fast forward a few moments and the reporters haven’t left. 'We're gone': Johnson finally concedes to the woman and leaves the property, both he and the camera woman unharmed, as police arrived. They do not intend to press charges . The irate woman manages to hit both reporter and photographer with one punch. ‘We’re gone, we’re gone, we’re gone,’ Johnson finally concedes after the woman knocks over the video camera and continues to threaten them. Johnson and Gill left unharmed as the police arrived, evidently called to the scene by concerned neighbors. Johnson makes clear that he’s unsure who the woman was or if she was a victim in the crime early that morning. Neighbors told him bad influences come and go from the area. They also said the people in the house had only lived there a handful of months. But, said Johnson, ‘A guy who said he cuts their grass said they were good people.’","WUSA reporters in Washington, DC were attacked by a woman while investigating an earlier hostage situation and assault in the home .

The top surviving leader of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge whose regime oversaw the death of two million people has said he was 'doing his duty' in a final statement at a UN-backed court today. Prosecutors are demanding the maximum sentence of life imprisonment for 'Brother Number Two' Nuon Chea, 87, and ex-head of state Khieu Samphan, 82, for their roles in a regime that left up to two million people dead in the late 1970s. Nuon Chea told the country's UN-backed tribunal in his final statement before a verdict that he had carried out his 'duty to serve my country and my beloved people'. 'Brother Number Two' Nuon Chea, 87, the top surviving leader of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge whose regime oversaw the death of two million people has said he was 'doing his duty' in a statement at a UN-backed court . Trial: Former Khmer Rouge (left) leader head of state Khieu Samphan and Brother Number Two Nuon Chea (right) in the courtroom at ECCC in Phnom Penh . 'Through this trial it has been shown clearly that I was not engaged in any commission of the crimes as alleged by the co-prosecutors. In short, I am innocent in relation to those allegations,' he said. He blamed everything on 'treacherous' subordinates. Ngor An, 69, who lost more than 10 relatives including three children under the Khmer Rouge, described Nuon Chea as a 'coward' for not admitting his guilt. 'I am angry with what he said. He must be jailed for life,' he said after watching the court proceedings. Led by Pol Pot, who died in 1998, the communist Khmer Rouge regime wiped out up to a quarter of the population through executions, starvation and overwork. Nuon Chea, 87, and ex-head of state Khieu Samphan, 82, are being chased for their roles in a regime that left up to two million people dead in the late 1970s . Cambodian villagers line up at an entrance before the final statements . The two defendants both insist they were unaware of the atrocities committed by the regime. 'I would like to express my deepest remorse and moral responsibility to victims and the Cambodian people who suffered during the Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge) regime,' Nuon Chea said. But he added that based on the evidence presented to the court, 'I respectfully submit to your honours to acquit me from all the charges and accordingly release me.' The complex case of the regime's two most senior surviving leaders has been split into a series of smaller trials, initially focusing on the forced evacuation of people into rural labour camps and related charges of crimes against humanity. A tourist looks at human skulls at Choeung Ek, one of the main killing fields of the Khmer Rouge regime in the outskirts of Phnom Penh, Cambodia . Cambodian visitors watching portraits of victims displayed in the infamous Tuol sleng Khmer Rouge prison, also known as S21, where thousands of Cambodian died during the brutal 1975-79 regime in Phnom Penh . More than two million people were expelled from Phnom Penh in April 1975 at gunpoint and marched to rural labour camps in one of the largest forced migrations in modern history. The defendants deny charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, to the dismay of survivors and relatives of victims. Led by Pol Pot, who died in 1998, the communist Khmer Rouge regime wiped out up to a quarter of the population through executions, starvation and overwork . 'We cannot accept his apology. He lied to us. He wanted to be acquitted. He did not care about others,' said Bin Sivla, 55, who lost 11 relatives under the regime. 'If he did not give the order, his subordinates would not have dared to kill,' she said, describing the Khmer Rouge leaders as 'worse than monsters'. 'Monsters would kill only a few people, but they killed millions of people.' The closing statements were scheduled to end on Thursday with a verdict expected in the first half of next year. The kingdom does not use the death penalty so life imprisonment is the toughest sentence that the court can hand down. The allegations of genocide and war crimes are due to be heard in later hearings although no date has yet been set. The trial, which began hearing evidence in late 2011, is widely seen as a landmark in the nation's quest for justice. Another defendant, former foreign minister Ieng Sary, died aged 87 in March this year, while the case against his wife Ieng Thirith - also an ex-minister - was suspended after the court ruled dementia left her unfit to stand trial. In its historic first trial, the court in 2010 sentenced former prison chief Kaing Guek Eav to 30 years in prison - later increased to life on appeal - for overseeing the deaths of 15,000 people.","Prosecutors are demanding the maximum sentence of life imprisonment .

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has told German officials he is prepared to testify over the extent to which the U.S. government tapped Angela Merkel's phone, it is claimed. The former CIA intelligence officer met with German MP Hans-Christian Stroebele in Moscow to discuss him becoming a star witness in a possible future public inquiry. And, in an escalation in the diplomatic row, prosecutors have hinted they are prepared to defy an American extradition request in order for fugitive Snowden to testify in Germany. High-level discussion: German Greens MP Hans-Christian Stroebele posted this picture of him with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden on Twitter after a meeting in Moscow . Mr Stroebele told ARD channel: 'He . expressed his principle readiness to help clarify the situation. Basis . for this is what we must create. That’s what we discussed for a long . time and from all angles.' The . MP, 74, who is a member of the German parliament's control committee . which is responsible for monitoring the work of intelligence agencies, . added: 'He is essentially prepared to come to Germany and give . testimony, but the conditions must be discussed.' Germany's . outrage over reports of bugging of chancellor Merkel's phone by the U.S. National . Security Agency (NSA) prompted it to summon the U.S. ambassador for the first time in living memory, an unprecedented post-war . diplomatic rift. Outrage: The meeting between Edward Snowden, left, and MP Hans-Christian Stroebele, right, is likely to raise the temperature of the diplomatic row after it emerged US spies had been bugging Angela Merkel's phone . Germany's parliament will hold a special session on November 18 to discuss the tapping, and the Greens and far-left Left party have demanded a public inquiry calling in witnesses including Snowden. The . German Federal Prosecutor’s Office may summon Snowden to be a witness . in the case, German justice minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger . told Deutschlandfunk radio on Sunday. 'If . our suspicions prove correct and a case is opened, the German Federal . Prosecutor’s Office will have to consider the possibility of . interrogating Snowden as a witness,' she said. If Snowden were to come to Germany for the case, the EU country could breach US’ requests for extradition, the minister added. Evidence: Edward Snowden, pictured, has told a German MP he is prepared to testify about US tapping of Angela Merkel's phone . Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger also said that the phone tapping is illegal and constitutes a crime, therefore those responsible should be held accountable. Thursday's encounter was Snowden's first known meeting with a foreign politician. It is also his first known meeting with any specific foreigner other than his father and a group of former U.S. national security officials he met in early October. Earlier this week it emerged Snowden had begun a working for a large Moscow-based website. The 30-year-old American fugitive's new role is surrounded by secrecy for 'security reasons', it was claimed. But his lawyer has denied that Snowden will be a state employee. News of his new role comes as a picture purporting to show Snowden on a tour boat on the Moscow river was shown by Life News. The former National Security Agency contractor is behind a series of major intelligence links on US and British snooping of telephones and the internet. Making himself at home: Edward Snowden pictured in an image shown on Russia's Life News purporting . to show him out in Moscow. He is due to start a new job in the Russian . city . His Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, who denied the post was as a state employee, said: 'Edward starts work in November.' 'He will provide support for a large Russian site,' he said, refusing to name the new employer or give details of his role. Snowden fled to Russia in June, hearing arrest and extradition to the US where he faces espionage charges. President Vladimir Putin has rejected American pleas to send Snowden home to face charges including espionage, and the temporary asylum he was granted in early August can be extended annually. Snowden has been spotted only a handful of times in Moscow. The Russians imply there is a risk he could be kidnapped or assassinated by the CIA. Western sources say the fact he is being concealed in Russia shows he is under the control of the Moscow secret services. Not working for the Russians: Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia after going on the run from the US, is not taking up a state job according to his lawyer . A picture purporting to show Snowden was released on Thursday by a Russian site with close ties to the secret services. He was wearing a cap, without glasses, leaning on the rail of a tour boat on the Moscow River. In the background is Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral. The same website earlier this month published a photograph of Snowden pushing a shopping trolley, later confirmed as authentic by his Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena. The photograph 'proves that the former US agent either lives permanently in Moscow or visits regularly,' claimed the site. New job: Exterior view on the Singer House building that houses the office of online social network VKontakte in St Petersburg.

A man has been arrested for defacing national monument Pompeys Pillar after he etched a love message just three feet from the historic Captain William Clark’s signature, made in 1806. The carving, which reads ‘Cole + Shpresa 10/10/2013’ with a love heart, was found by shocked deputies at the famous monument in Montana. Ignoring the warning signs, security cameras and railings, a man from Minnesota admitted to the crime, which has been described as a ‘senseless act of vandalism’. 'Senseless vandalism': A man has been arrested for creating this graffiti, found just three feet from the 1806 signature of Captain William Clark which made Pomeys Pillar a landmark . The man, who had been visiting the tourist attraction with his wife, now faces charges under federal law which protects national monuments. The 1806 signature is one of the last remaining pieces of physical evidence of the Lewis and Clark expedition, the first explorers to cross the western region of America. Jonathan Peart, the director of Friends of Pompeys Pillar, told 3KRTV.com: ‘This belongs to all of us - to you, to me to every American out there and to deface this is just a senseless act of vandalism and violence to something that has historical and cultural importance.’ National monument: Deputies were alarmed to find the carving so close to this historical etching, one of the last remaining pieces of physical evidence of the Lewis and Clark expedition . A silent alarm alerted Bureau of Land Management (BLM) deputies that someone had climbed over the guard rail on October 10. A man and a woman were questioned and their contact details recorded but it was not until a week later that the love message was found by an employee. Reviewing security footage, the suspected culprit was soon found according to Peart. He said: ‘These National treasures should be treated with respect and those who don't need to be punished.’ The man is yet to be officially identified as the BLM continues to investigate. According to WDEF.com, Montana/Dakotas BLM spokesman Melodie Lloyd said that the suspect had been apprehended and charges are yet to be filed. Historical importance: The man faces felony charges for defacing Pomeys Pillar (pictured), a 150-foot sandstone butte in the Yellowstone Valley . To remove the graffiti will cost between $4,000 and $5,000, according to the Friends of Pompeys Pillar. The monument is open to the public on foot every day of the year but barriers restrict visitor access to the signature. Captain William Clark scrawled his name and the date, July 25, 1806, on the 150-foot sandstone butte in the Yellowstone Valley after his return to America. The signature looks as it did some 200 years ago. The monument, 25 miles northeast of Billings, Montana, attracts some 50,000 every year. It was named a national monument in 2001.

A woman who was sentenced to life in prison as a teenager for killing her former pimp has been released under a new California law that allows for the re-sentencing of certain inmates convicted as juveniles. Sara Kruzan was paroled Thursday from Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla after serving 19 years. Kruzan was just 17 when she was told she . would die in prison for the 1994 shooting of George Gilbert Howard in a . Riverside motel room. Now and then: Sara Kruzan, pictured in July, left, and as a teenager, right, will walk free from jail after almost two decades behind bars . She said Howard sexually assaulted her at an early age and she began working for him as a prostitute at 13. Prosecutors said Kruzan was no longer working for Howard when she killed him. In . January, a Riverside County judge reduced Kruzan's conviction to . second-degree murder, making her immediately eligible for parole. The decision to free her was taken last Friday after Californian Governor Jerry Brown decided not to contest a state parole board decision to let her leave jail. Prisoner: Earlier pictures show Sara Kruzan during her time in prison . Her case became a high-profile . example used by state Sen. Leland Yee, D-San Francisco, who sought to . soften harsh life sentences for juveniles. 'It is justice long overdue,' Yee told the Los Angeles Times. He called Kruzan's case the 'perfect example of adults who failed her, of society failing her. 'You had a predator who stalked her, raped her, forced her into prostitution, and there was no one around.' Kruzan's case garnered widespread publicity in 2010 after Human Rights Watch posted a six-minute interview with her on YouTube. Clemency: Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger commuted her sentence to 25-years-to-life with the possibility of parole on his last full day in office . That year culminated with Gov. Arnold . Schwarzenegger commuting her sentence to 25-years-to-life with the . possibility of parole on his last full day in office. Schwarzenegger said he still considered . her guilty of first-degree murder, but he sympathized with her defense . that the man she killed had sexually abused her and served as her pimp . for years. 'Given Ms. Kruzan's age at the time of the murder, and considering the significant abuse she suffered at his hands, I believe Ms. Kruzan's sentence is excessive,' the governor wrote in his commutation message. 'It is apparent that Ms. Kruzan suffered significant abuse starting at a vulnerable age.' In January, a Riverside judge further reduced her first-degree murder conviction to second degree, making her immediately eligible for release. Yee's legislation to allow new sentencing hearings for juveniles sent to prison for life without parole became law in January. Kruzan pictured with her aunt Ann Rogen who asked why it had taken the Californian governor so long to make his decision . Approved: Governor Jerry Brown has decided to allow freedom to a woman who received a life sentence when she was a teen for killing her former pimp . In September, Brown signed a second bill requiring parole boards to give special consideration to juveniles tried as adults who have served at least 15 years of lengthy sentences. Advocates estimate that there are more than 1,000 prisoners already eligible for parole hearings under that new law. Brown's decision on Kruzan's case came nearly two weeks before the deadline for his action. Kruzan was housed at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla. Her aunt told the Associated Press she wasn't surprised by the governor's action. 'I just wondered why it took so long,' Ann Rogen of Riverside said.","Sara Kruzan finally walked free on Thursday after almost two decades behind bars .

Government safety rules are changing to let airline passengers use most electronic devices from gate-to-gate. The change will let passengers read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music at any time during flight instead what is often just a brief cruising period between take-off and descent. The Federal Aviation Administration says airlines can allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs and landings on planes that meet certain criteria for protecting aircraft systems from electronic interference. It's a miracle! The FAA has finally lifted rules that ban the use of electronic devices during take-off and landing . Rules still apply: There are stipulations, of course, and the roll-out time will vary between airlines, but with only 'very limited exception' Most new airliners are expected to meet the criteria 'with very limited exception' but changes won't happen immediately. So why the change of heart? The FAA isn't saying complaints spurred the decision, per se, and instead uses the term 'input.' Stow this! Passengers will soon be allowed to watch movies, read ebooks, and play games on their gadgets from gat-to-gate. Cell phone and internet use, however, are still banned . As per the FAA's October 31 release: 'The FAA based its decision on input from a group of experts that included representatives from the airlines, aviation manufacturers, passengers, pilots, flight attendants, and the mobile technology industry.' Even fed up U.S. Senators had made their annoyance known. 'There is widespread support among . the traveling public to be able to read a book, regardless of whether . it's in a dead tree or digital form, more so than there is for your . seatmate to talk on their cellphone,' a representative for Missouri . Democrat Claire McCaskill, who's criticized the ban on electronics . below 10,000 feet, told the Wall Street Journal. Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers' use of the devices has been Amazon.com. In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none. FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk. Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal. Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old. However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility. A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology. 'We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security,' said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. According . to the release, the new rules will implemented at different times . depending on the airline. But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said. Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode. So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.

The behaviour of accused murderer Simon Gittany in the minutes after his ballerina girlfriend plunged to her death from their 15th-storey Sydney apartment was revealed in CCTV footage shown to a jury today. Dressed in striped pyjama bottoms, he is seen hurrying in and out of the apartment before getting into the lift to ride to the ground floor, slapping his hands onto the top of his head before crouching over, hands on his knees as he descends. The security camera footage was presented to the court by the prosecution, which claims 40-year-old Gittany threw his 30-year-old Canadian girlfriend Lisa Harnum to her death after a fierce argument over her plans to leave him. Scroll down for the CCTV . Evidence: CCTV footage shows Simon Gittany holding his hands on his head as he rides a lift moments after he allegedly threw his fiancee to her death off the 15th-floor balcony of their Sydney apartment . Gesticulating: Gittany throws his hands up in the air as he heads to the ground floor where the body of his girlfriend is lying in the street . The court had already heard that a torn-up note was found in Miss Harnum’s jeans’ pocket after her death plunge, which stated: ‘There are surveillance cameras inside and outside the house.’ Today, evidence from CCTV cameras in the hallway was shown to the jury - but despite a security camera being inside the apartment police found it had not recorded any of the 69 seconds between Gittany being seen to drag his girlfriend back into the apartment and her death plunge. What the video evidence taken from the hallway and the lift did show was an apparently frustrated Gittany moving in and out of the apartment and then getting into the lift following Miss Harnum’s fall. Chillingly, security footage on the outside of the building captures Miss Harnum hitting the ground on busy Liverpool Street at 9.55.13am on July 30 2011. On trial: Gittany (left) is accused of murdering his 30-year-old Canadian girlfriend Lisa Harnum (right) after a fierce argument over her plans to leave him . Then, at 9.55.27am Gittany, in pyjama bottoms but without a shirt, is seen leaving through the front door of the apartment, putting his hands on his head, before walking back inside a few seconds later. For the next 33 seconds there is no security camera record of what he did next. But then at 9.56.08am he is seen leaving apartment 1503 for the second time, pulling a white T-shirt over his head. A second video shown to the court captures Gittany stepping into a shiny steel-panelled lift, still wearing his pyjama pants. It is then that the lift’s internal security camera take over his actions. He is seen placing his hands on his head and bending over with hands on his knees. He is also seen throwing his hands up in the air as he stares at the lift doors on the descent. Struggle: Gittany is seen grabbing his fiancee minutes before she plunged 15 storeys to her death . Finally he is seen running from the lift and through the foyer towards the street where the body of his fiancee is lying. A third video shown to the court - and which runs for 27 minutes - shows Gittany hurrying towards the street, with buses, cars and pedestrians passing by. He is seen walking back into the foyer of the luxury complex, accompanied by an unknown person, where he is again seen with his hands on his head before he walks out again . Several people are seen strolling out of the apartment block, apparently unaware of the scene of death on the footpath. Gittany is joined by a detective and sits in a black armchair facing the pavement where the body of Miss Harnum is lying. The trial in which Gittany has pleaded not guilty to murder is continuing before Justice Lucy McCallum.

Despite being the mastermind of a $20 billion investment fraud, Bernard Madoff was no good at maths, according to a former employee. David Kugel, a former supervisory trader for Madoff, told the jury in the Manhattan federal court that the fraudster ‘had trouble with long division’. Madoff, 75, is serving a 150-year prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2009 to defrauding investors in his investment firm, considered to be one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in US history. No good at maths: Bernard Madoff, the mastermind of a $20 billion investment fraud, 'had trouble with long division' a former employee told the court . Kugel, 68, told the court that soon after he was employed to trade convertible bonds by the firm in the 1970s, Madoff got him to figure out rates of return for similar deals he was brokering with private clients. According to The New York Post, when asked by assistant US attorney Matthew Schwartz’s whether Madoff was ‘good in math’, Kugel said: ‘In some aspects, yes, in some aspects, no. ‘He had trouble with long division.’ Kugel was in court as the first of five government witnesses, all former Madoff employees, to provide evidence on how defendants Annette Bongiorno and Joann Crupi used falsified information on customer accounts. Under suspicion: Kugel said he was asked to provide outdated trades for defendant Joann Crupi . A lawsuit filed by the Securities and . Exchange Commission has said that from 2004 through 2008 Crupi . accumulated $270,000 in expenses on the firm's credit card for which she . never reimbursed the company. Kugel said Madoff’s secretary . Bongiorno asked him for out-of-date pricing data in the early 1970s. He . also laid out this information for Crupi in the late 1980s early 1990s. He told the court that Bongiorno kept . back issues of The Wall Street Journal to reference historical prices in . order to ‘fabricate’ trades. Kugel said his suspicions were . realised when he opened a personal investment account with the Madoff . firm to invest $25,000 after the sale of his father-in-law’s house, and . found his out-of-date trades on his personal statement. The witness claimed never to have . suspected a Ponzi scheme and when he questioned Madoff about where the . money was going, Madoff told him it was invested in foreign currency, . shopping centres and other such investments. Kugel said: ‘He was my boss and he asked me to do something. I knew it was wrong, but I just didn’t question him.’ In 2011, Kugel pleaded guilty to . creating the outdated trades which boosted the fraud after his personal . account grew to $10 million at one stage. Other employees: Daniel Bonventre (left) , the director of operations for the firm, and portfolio manager Annette Bongiorno (right) are also listed as defendants in this case . What do they know: Like their co-defendants, computer programmers Jerome O'Hara (right) and George Perez (right) have both entered not guilty pleas . The man’s son, Craig Kugel, also pleaded guilty to being involved in the scheme while working in Madoff’s human resources. Earlier in the trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Zach showed jurors Crupi's corporate credit card . statements for 2004, 2005 and 2006, noting that she took cruises and . trips to Las Vegas with family members. Pleaded guilty: Kugel's son Craig Kugel (pictured) was also involved in the scheme while working in Madoff's human resources department . Another lavish expense included her . trips to a liquor store called the Wine Library in Springfield, New . Jersey, where she spent almost $2,000 on one occasion. Zach asked a witness from the firm . whether she observed any behaviour by Crupi that would have explained . the expenditures as legitimate business expenses, to which they . responded no. The government said she also wired . $2.25 million from the firm's main account to an outside account in late . 2008 so she could purchase a beach house in New Jersey. In addition to Crupi, the defendants . include Daniel Bonventre, the director of operations for the firm; . Annette Bongiorno, another portfolio manager; and Jerome O'Hara and . George Perez, both computer programmers. All five pleaded not guilty and their . lawyers have said they did not know about Madoff's scheme or were merely . puppets under Madoff's spell. Kugel will take the stand again on Monday as the case continues.","David Kugel said he provided outdated trades for Madoff employees .

Here, a body is seen in the road, believed to be Sgt Oliveira . Bodies: According to witnesses on Globo TV, eight gunmen pulled up outside the 1st Criminal Court of Bangu in two cars around 5.30pm . The mobsters planned to break out two of Rio’s notorious gang ring-leaders, Alexandre Bandeira de Melo, 40, nicknamed the ‘Lice’, and Vanderlan Ramos da Silva, 30, known as ‘Chocolate’.  Both were former-leading drug lords in Rio’s favelas with links to Comando Vermelho (Red Command), the largest  organised crime syndicate in the capital. 'Four men in the first car got out and closed the street down, they had rifles and guns,' said an eye-witness to Globo TV, who declined to be identified. 'They told everyone on the street to . stay calm. A policemen on the door, guarding the courthouse, spotted . them and they shot him.

None of the gang members managed to escape. All were rounded up and taken back to prison . Another witness described the mayhem to Globo TV as 'something out of a movie'. According to a police report, Sergeant Oliveira tried to run inside the courthouse to warn other officers of the attack. He was shot dead on the court steps. Sergeant Gonçalves, who was also on the stairs, was hit in the head. Four gunmen entered the building and four stayed outside to give cover, spraying, among other things, a passing police car with bullets. The officers from the car leapt from the car and exchanged fire with the four gunmen. Crime ridden: The gun battle erupted in Bangu, West Rio, close to where ex-footballer, Joao Rodrigo Silva Santos, was murdered earlier this week . But the rescue attempt backfired when the mobsters inside the building were overcome by officers and were forced to escape from the back of the courthouse. None of the gang members managed to escape and were rounded up and taken back to prison. According to another witness at the scene, the four gunmen took the keys of cars parked at the court to make their getaway. One of the cars used by the criminals in the attack was found at a petrol station a few miles away in Padre Miguel, shortly after 9pm on Thursday. 'It was an organised action carried out by a large number of people. Four managed to enter the court building armed with rifles,' said homicide detective, Alan Duarte. He added that the officers escorting the criminals had been surprised by the attack. 'We had no information that this was going to happen, so the police force was not strengthened,' he revealed. Rio’s Secretary of State for Security, José Mariano Beltrame, said on Thursday night that he had instructed the transfer of Melo and Silva to different state prisons, 'considering the audacity and the consequences the actions caused.' The schoolboy who died was described by his football coach as a talented and rising star. 'Kayo was one of the team's top scorers in the league. His dream was to become a famous player. He was a very quiet and studious boy and always came here with his grandmother or mother,' Luiz Manoel Gomes Avila, director of the Bangu Atlético Clube futsal team told Globo.

But a post on the official Help Find Ben Needham Facebook page confirmed the DNA comparison analysis had not found a match. The post said: ‘The Needham family have, in the last few minutes......had confirmation that the DNA results on the man in Cyprus have came back as negative. 'This, again, is more disappointment for Kerry and her family. However, they remain strong and resolute in their search for Ben, and there are other leads currently being looked into which keeps their hopes alive.’ Ben, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, went missing on the Greek island of Kos 22 years ago, when he was a toddler. The man who handed himself in to authorities in Cyprus this week has facial similarities with reconstructions of how Ben may now look, the family said. He came forward after a video emerged of him at a church in Limassol, on the island. Ben vanished on July 24, 1991 after travelling to Kos with his mother and grandparents, Eddie and Christine, who were renovating a farmhouse in the village of Iraklise.

Ben's . mother Kerry has seen an image of the tall, blue-eyed man they had been testing, with light brown hair, wearing a blue and white striped rugby . top. She said her 'head was . all over the place' and that the photo did bear a resemblance to Ben. There is also a video of the 22-year-old man, which has been viewed by . authorities. He has been living in Cyprus since February, and his parents live abroad, he said. He . told police that he recognised himself in the video and photos after . they were shown on Cypriot television news but was afraid to come forward . because he didn't know why they were looking for him. The . man came to the attention of the Greek police when he fled the mainland . with his family a few years ago to avoid compulsory military service. After seeing the image, Mrs Needham, 41, told the Sunday Mirror that she believed the man in the photograph could be Ben, who would now be aged 23. She said: 'I’ve seen the picture and believe he bears a resemblance to how Ben might now look. 'As a family we’re greatly . lifted by this and we will be in close contact with the Greek . authorities to make sure we are kept fully aware of any progress. 'We’ve never given up hope of finding Ben and we are encouraged that the police in Greece are continuing to investigate.' The image came to light after an unnamed tipster approached the Lawyers Association in Kos. Disappearance: Ben's family were on a trip to Kos, above, in 1991 when the toddler went missing .

Last . year, officers from South Yorkshire police travelled to the island to . conduct their own land search, but no major new leads emerged. The . case bears strong links to the tale of little 'Maria', the . four-year-old blonde girl who was found living with Romas Greece this . month, after allegedly being 'trafficked'. Search goes on: South Yorkshire Police Officers, above, travelled to Kos last year to conduct their own search for missing Ben . It has since emerged that she is the daughter of a Bulgarian woman called Sasha Ruseva after DNA tests proved biological link. Mrs . Ruseva, 35, claimed she handed her daughter over to a Roma family after . she gave birth in Greece and could not afford to register the new born. But she and her husband Atanas, 37, could now now face prosecution after allegations that she sold Maria for profit. Regardless . of the conclusion, the evidence of Romas having acquired children who . are not their own lends support to the theory that more missing children . could have ended up in the impoverished communities. Maria's story sent shockwaves all round the world with parents of missing youngsters given fresh hope by her discovery.

She also promised to slash the number of grounds on which migrants can lodge an appeal from the current 17 to just four after the fiasco of the deportation of Abu Qatada, who finally returned home to Jordan earlier this year after a 12-year legal battle. Scroll down for video . Big changes: Home secretary Theresa May plans a major shake-up of the immigration laws in Britain . Problems: Mrs May said the immigration system is like a never-ending game of snakes and ladders with almost 70,000 appeals heard every year . Home Office officials expect the . crackdown to more than halve the astonishing 68,000 cases lodged against . the Government every year. ‘I am clear that the law must be on the side of people who respect the law, not those who break it,’ Mrs May said. Her . move came as David Cameron gave the strongest signal yet that the . Tories are ready to quit the meddling European Court of Human Rights. The . Prime Minister said he would do ‘whatever it takes’ to ensure Britain . can throw out people who pose a threat to the country and have no right . to be here. The court’s . interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is . enshrined in British law in the Human Rights Act, has been condemned by . many Conservative MPs. Asked if the party is considering complete withdrawal, the Prime Minister said: ‘It may be that that is where we end up.’ Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the Conservative Party conference in Manchester today that the court has become a ‘big international frustration’. A Tory government would ‘scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act and make sure that with legal rights go legal responsibilities’. Ministers have tried for years to take a . hard line against preachers of hate, foreign criminals and illegal . immigrants. But they can drag out the appeal process for years – usually . by citing the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human . Rights. Theresa May's announcement comes after David Cameron, pictured at the Tory conference yesterday, gave the strongest signal yet that the Tories are ready to quit the European Court of Human Rights . The ECHR has been invoked by scores of people fighting deportation from Britain. They argue its provisions mean they are entitled to various rights, including the right to a family life. As soon as an appeal is lodged, deportation proceedings are halted. In a Daily Mail interview, Mrs May said public trust was being undermined – and tens of millions of pounds squandered – by migrants and their lawyers playing the system. The number of grounds that a migrant can appeal on will be cut from 17 to four after it took a 12-year legal battle to deport Abu Qatada . In future, officials will be told to throw people out of the country as soon as their case has been decided by the Government – a system which is already in place in France. They can still appeal, but only from their homeland. The only exception would be in cases where there is a ‘risk of serious irreversible harm’, such as torture or execution. Migrants who claim to have a right to a ‘family life’ under article 8 of the Human Rights – the biggest frustration to the public – can still be thrown out. Tory backbenchers will hope the tough stance, which will be unveiled in Mrs May’s speech to the conference today, will help to win back voters who have defected to Ukip. Mrs May said: ‘The Abu Qatada case proved that we need a dramatic change in our human rights law. We’re going to cut the number of appeal rights, extend cases where we deport first and hear the appeal later, and use primary legislation to make sure judges interpret the “right to a family life” properly.’ Mrs May also wants to end the farce of migrants being able to build up ‘rights’ to stay in Britain by stringing out an appeal for as long as possible. The longer a person can remain in the UK - even if they are facing removal - the easier it is to claim they have established a ‘family life’. A new Immigration Bill will be introduced when Parliament returns. The 17 existing rights of appeal will be cut to just four. A right of appeal will only exist where the decision is complex and fact-specific. The Tories say it will reduce the number of appeals by nearly 60 per cent, leading to an estimated net saving of £219million over ten years. Tough: The Home Secretary accused the Lib Dems of blocking plans for an immigration bond . In her speech to the Tory party conference in Manchester today, Mrs May said: 'The Government will soon publish the Immigration Bill, which will make it easier to get rid of people with no right to be here. 'First, we are going to cut the number of appeal rights. At the moment the system is like a never-ending game of snakes and ladders with almost 70,000 appeals heard every year. 'The winners - foreign criminals and immigration lawyers, while the losers are the victims of these crimes and the public. 'So we're going to cut the number of appeal rights from 17 to four and in doing so cut the total number of appeals by more than half. 'Last year human rights were cited in almost 10,000 immigration appeal cases so the second thing we will do is extend the number of non-suspensive appeals. 'That means that where there is no risk of serious and irreversible harm we should deport foreign criminals first and hear their appeals later.' Stepping out: Theresa May wore shiny patent brogues with jewelled heels to deliver her speech in the main hall on the second day of the Conservative Party . Theresa May was dressed for business from head-to-toe as she delivered her speech to Conservative delegates in Manchester. Ditching a more obvious power dressing stiletto for a pair of shiny patent brogues the Home Secretary proved she is more than a dress as she promised to kick out illegal immigrants, at the same time as impressing any fashion watchers. Flats are back this season. And 56-year-old Theresa proved a sensible shoe doesn’t need to make you look like an old man by choosing a dressy pair from Russell & Bromley. The always stylish politician loves to add interest to a business outfit with a statement shoe. Pledge: Mrs May said new immigration laws will make it easier to get rid of people with no right to be here . Ever since she stepped out in a pair of leopard-print kitten heels at the Tory party conference in 2002 her feet have been a focus for fashionistas. She has revealed that she uses her shoes as an ‘icebreaker’ in important talks, saying: ‘I have no regrets (about being famous for my shoes). The good thing is that they are often an icebreaker.’ Other bold choices of her footwear have included animal-print kitten heels, leopard-print wellies, turquoise sandals, bejellewed heels, striped courts and ruby-red flats. The  shiny leather and smattering of bling on Monday’s shoes gave these ladylike lace-ups a stylish edge. The tartan suit, too, is bang on trend, as seen on the catwalks of Chanel and model of the moment Cara Delevingne.","Comes after Cameron indicated the .

The highly sophisticated tunnel runs underneath the border connecting the Mexican city of Tijuana with San Diego, California. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the passage had been recently completed. Officials didn't elaborate any further in a brief statement. Smuggling: Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the passage, near Tijuana airport, had been recently completed . Mexican news organizations published photos that show a deep, well-built tunnel near Tijuana airport. The airport is four miles away from the American border by road, but only a matter of yards away in a straight line. Alberto Capella, Tijuana's public safety chief, said a law enforcement operation was underway and he couldn't provide any more details. Dozens of tunnels have been discovered along the border in recent years, designed largely to smuggle marijuana to the United States. Last year, a 240-yard drug-smuggling tunnel was unearthed in Arizona. The Mexican Army also found a second incomplete tunnel under a bathroom sink in Tijuana that went 200 yards into San Diego, California. The Tijuana tunnel had been under investigation by US authorities for three months, and they found no connections to the smuggling operation involving the Arizona passageway. Small: Last year, a 240-yard drug-smuggling tunnel was unearthed in Arizona (pictured here) The entrance measured 24 inches by 24 inches and it dropped down 60ft into a 240-yard tunnel . It takes between six months and a year to build a tunnel, authorities say. Workers use shovels and pickaxes to slowly dig through the soil, sleeping in buildings where the tunnels begin until the job is done. Sometimes they use pneumatic tools. A total of 156 secret tunnels have been found along the border since 1990, but the vast majority were incomplete. Raids last November on two tunnels linking San Diego and Tijuana netted a combined 52 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border. In early December 2009, authorities found an incomplete tunnel that stretched nearly 900 feet into San Diego from Tijuana, equipped with an elevator at the Mexican entrance. This tunnel was said to have cost more than £930,000 to build.","Tunnel connects Mexican city of Tijuana with San Diego, California .

A woman who spent most her adult life as a size 30 shed the pounds in a phenomenal transformation - but lost her husband in the process. Welsh-born Cheryl Blakelock, 54, who lives in Barnsley, slimmed to a size 10 but found out her husband of 25 years had started seeing her pre-weight loss doppelganger. Cheryl was shocked to discover husband's lover was a size 24 - and even dressed like her before she lost all the weight. Cheryl says when she was big she was 'easily controlled' and her husband didn't like the changes in her personality - the fact she became more confident - when she lost weight . 'Once I found out about the affair . that was it,' explains Cheryl. 'I found out about the affair on the Friday morning, by Friday afternoon, the house was up for sale and I'd booked an . appointment with the solicitor.' In a revealing new series dubbed I Lost Weight But I Lost My Husband!, Channel 5 follow a group of women whose weight-loss has changed them, their relationships and their lives. In the first episode, airing tomorrow, Cheryl, who works at O2, explains that when she was overweight she lost her sense of her identity. 'While I was overweight I was easily controlled,' she says. 'I didn't really want friends. I didn't really have friends. I lived my life through my children. I didn't want to stand out, I wanted to blend into the shadows.' When Cheryl was a size 30 she hid behind frumpy clothes and shied away from society. But when she shed the pounds, she finally stepped out into the light. Cheryl hid from the limelight and lived her life through her children while she was overweight . 'It's like being an onion,' she says. 'As the weight comes on it sort of covers your personality, it encloses you. Then, as the weight comes off, it exposes who you really are. 'When I became slim it was like the weight came off my brain as well.' When Cheryl decided to lose weight and dropped 10 dress sizes, she began to take control of her life. She felt like a new woman - . one who gained confidence and would answer back - but she believes her . husband found the change hard to deal with. 'He slowly lost control and that's when he started looking for another woman,' says Cheryl. 'A text came on his phone and I read it, and I even remember the words to this day.' The intimate nature of the text convinced Cheryl her husband was having an affair. That was enough of a shock, but Cheryl was even more surprised when she saw the woman her husband was having an affair with. She'd spent 22 years being overweight and couldn't go back to being that woman again . When Cheryl was a size 30 she hid behind frumpy clothes and shied away from society . 'I didn't know much about her apart from that she was younger than me' she says. 'But . then when I saw the size of her... she was a size 24. At the time when . we actually split, I was a size 10.

The makers of the Up Couture T-shirt would certainly like you to believe so. Their new T-shirt, designed in France, has just launched in the UK and claims it can, ‘through its innovative, patented, flexible’ design which ‘encourages the holding of the shoulders in a beautiful position’ give you ‘a dream posture.’ Of course this isn't the first bit of kit designed to get us sitting upright with our shoulders back. A new T-shirt, called Up Couture, has just launched in the UK and claims it can give you 'a dream posture' Last year M&S launched their £25 Perfect Poise posture bra, while Shoulders Back, £37.99, is a slightly complicated looking strap and harness contraption that was originally developed to help horse riders sit up straight but has become popular with everyone from nurses to yoga fans. But this is the first time such technology has been put into a T-shirt. So how does it work? From the outside it looks like a simple white cotton T-shirt but turn it inside out and you'll find a stiffer blue fabric that's bonded to the cotton in a pattern that goes across the top part of the back, over the shoulders and around the upper arms. The idea is that the stiffer fabric should sit flat against your back - as it will when you have your shoulder blades back and down, and your back flat. The company says that the T-shirt is made in France from very specialist materials using a very time-consuming process which, they maintain, justifies the £108 price . But start to curve your back or bring your shoulders forward, and the stiffer fabric won't flex with you, so you feel some resistance across your back, shoulders and upper arms, sort of strait-jacket lite, if you will. Apparently the T-shirt is ‘most efficient when it is fitted’ basically if you’re undecided, opt for a smaller size. As I usually wear a 10-12, I go for the Small, which is equivalent to a 10. It's nicely cut - although could do with being a little bit longer in the body - and just looks like a normal white t-shirt, albeit quite a tight one. I can feel it pulling across my shoulders - which is of course the point as it reminds me to pull my shoulders back. Unfortunately - maybe because I'm too easily distracted - the reminder doesn't last for long. All too soon with an urgent email and a couple of phone calls vying for my attention, my shoulders are rounding and yes, while feeling the shirt pull across my back and at the tops of my arms is not terribly comfortable, it's not so painful that it's forefront of my mind. What is painful is the price - €127 or a staggering £108. For that, I want something that's going to give me the deportment of a ballerina who's spent three years at a Swiss finishing school, not something that allows me to slump back into my previous poor posture without much effort or discomfort. The company says that the T-shirt is made in France from very specialist materials using a very time-consuming process which, they maintain, justifies the price. Personally, I'm not convinced - maybe if your concentration is better than mine, or your bank balance is bigger, it's a worthwhile investment, but with proven posture prompters that are less expensive, I won't be bending over to get my wallet out of my bag for this one.

Forget about warming comfort food and step away from the office biscuit tin. For those looking to wow colleagues - and the office crush - at this year’s Christmas party, the diet needs to start today. With 62 per cent of women admitting in a new survey that they plan to slim down for the festive season, today has been earmarked as the time to start in order to safely drop a dress size. Over half (52 per cent) the women polled admitted to wanting to lose at least 9lbs before they slip into their party dresses (the equivalent of a full dress size). Just 10 per cent admitted they were completely happy with their current shape and size. And it seems it is the workplace where we most want to impress. Some 40 per cent of women revealed they . specifically want to drop the pounds ahead of their work Christmas party . to feel confident in front of their colleagues. But yearly summer and pre-Christmas slim downs can be dangerous, not only to our health if weight is dropped too fast, but also to our wallets. Growing in and out of clothes is one of the UK’s biggest fashion complaints costing the average women up to £500 a year, with 59 per cent of women admitting their weight fluctuates anywhere between 4-10lbs every year. Fad diets, New Year resolutions and special occasions - namely Christmas, weddings and holidays - were given as the main reasons for these weight fluctuations. One in five women now claims to own up 15 party dresses, with the Little Black Dress polled as the favourite festive frock choice for 73 per cent of women, who admitted to owning at least ten LBDs at any one time. Almost a third of women also admitted to holding onto up to five dresses that are too small for them, in the hope of one day getting into them once again. If you want to drop a dress size before the party season starts, it's time to swap the donuts for fruit . Moda lace peplum dress, £20 left, and one shoulder tulip dress, £16, right, are part of the new range by George at Asda . The survey was conducted by George at Asda as they release a new range of 30 Little Black Dresses. The NHS recommends that if you’re trying to lose weight, the safe weekly rate of weight loss is between 0.5kg and 1kg. That’s between around 1lb to 2lb a week. Lose weight faster than this, and you are at risk of a host of health problems that include malnutrition and gallstones. Fad diets (that involve simply changing your diet for a few weeks) associated with very rapid weight loss are also unlikely to lead you to a healthy weight in the long-term. They recommend women should eat and drink about 1,400kcal a day when trying to loose weight.","52% admit they want to lose at least 9lbs before the party season .

Mike Reda's videotaped interrogation with Detroit police detectives was played in court on Thursday during a hearing at which a judge determined there was enough evidence for him to stand trial on two counts of first-degree murder, assault with intent to murder and other felony charges. He's accused of shooting Deborah Socia, 59, and Maria Gonzalez, 61, on Oct. 20 at the two-story, 80-unit Pablo Davis Elder Living Center on the city's southwest side.

Reda is accused of shooting Maria Gonzalez, left, and Deborah Socia, right, at the Pablo Davis Elder Living Center . 'I was drunk, I was angry,' Reda told investigators. 'I just couldn't take it no more.' Reda said during the interrogation on the day after the shootings that he was retired, lived alone at the center and had seven children as well as more than two dozen grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He had dated the same woman for several years, but said the two women had befriended her and frequently kept the girlfriend away from him. He said he'd been drinking brandy and couldn't remember most details of the day, but later in the interview told the two detectives that he approached Socia and another man, Paul Fratangelo, on the center's grounds with his MP5 rifle. Reda said his rifle discharged one time 'by accident.' Reda had been dating the same woman for several years, but said the two women he killed had befriended her and frequently kept the girlfriend away from him . Reda said he then went inside to Gonzalez's apartment, kicked in her door and shot her twice in the head. He asked detectives twice if the women were alive or dead, and at the end of the interview one investigator told him they were dead. Reda paused, sighed heavily and said, 'That's really bad.' Defense attorney Bryan Sherer declined to comment before and after the hearing. Friends and family members of the victims also declined comment outside court. Fratangelo testified that he was sitting on a bench with Socia, smoking a cigarette and talking before dinner, when Reda walked toward them. Fratangelo, 61, said Reda swung his weapon back and forth between the two while ordering Fratangelo to 'basically get on my knees and pray.' The incident happened at the Pablo Davis Elder Living Center in Detroit on October 20 . 'I said, ""Mike, not this. Not like this. We're both vets."" I'm basically pleading with my life,' Fratangelo said, adding that Reda seemed 'on edge' but 'very composed.' Fratangelo said Socia asked Reda what he was doing, and he fired his gun one time. Afterward, Fratangelo said he entered the building and tried to trap Reda between two sets of doors. Fratangelo then 'bolted down the hall,' told Socia's son that 'Mike is on a rampage' and to 'call 911.' The judge struck down Sherer's argument that Fratangelo wasn't injured or threatened so his client shouldn't be held on the charge of assault with intent to murder.

The sum's not bad for the 26-year-old actress, considering their marriage lasted just two years. The divorce deal looks a little less generous in light of Musk's net worth though, which is an estimated $2 billion (Rs11,095 crore) - the result of a fantastically successful career in the tech industry.

But, in the interim, Riley gets to . keep her Cartier and Gucci watches, an assortment of diamond jewellery . and her $110,000 Tesla Roadster. She received $1.4 million up front as . an initial payoff, according to court documents. Content: Ms Riley's lawyers aren't contesting the meager settlement . Musk, a South African who attended . the University of Pennsylvania, made his fortune by founding a series of . highly successful ventures - beginning with Zip2, which produced online . content publishing software that was purchased in 1999 for nearly $340 . million. Later, for his next venture, Musk helped create PayPal, the online money transfer and payment service. Ebay bought PayPal for $1.2 billion in 2002. Musk founded Space X later that year - an outer space exploration company. In 2009, the company launched the first privately owned liquid-fuelled rocket ever to enter space. Space X now has a contract to deliver cargo to the International Space Station that is worth between $1.6-$3.1 billion. Musk also founded Tesla Motors, an . electric car company that had a $226 million initial public offering in . 2010. For all his wealth, Riley seems content with the $4.2 million . figure.

The self-imposed stay was capped off with a massive charity donation and two would-be thieves were arrested. The painting that Banksy added a Nazi officer to fetched $615,000 in an online auction and two men were hoping to make a similar windfall. By the time that fans had gathered by the seemingly abandoned building in Queens where Banksy attached an inflatable balloon in the shape of his name, there were two men who had gotten a ladder and were in the process of cutting it down. Final piece: Banky's last work during his 'New York residency' came in the form of an eponymous balloon . Gone: Hours after it was announced, two would-be thieves got up on the platform and tried to run off with it . Local business owners and fans called police and helped apprehend the men as they were trying to stuff the balloon in their getaway car. A struggle ensued, but police were eventually able to get the balloon from the men and arrested them for criminal trespassing. Another man was arrested in the struggle and faces an additional charge of criminal mischief. Police would not reveal who were the ones who had tried to steal the ladder and who was just involved in the struggle with police and the would-be thief’s. Master plan: The men didn't account for a crowd of fans to be on the scene as they cut down the inflatable and tried to hoist it down into an awaiting truck . Stealing the illegal: A struggle ensued between the thieves, fans and police . Caught: The two men were arrested and charged with criminal trespassing and another man was also charged . Carting it off: Police ended up being the ones to take the inflatable back with them . The police department only revealed the names of the three individuals who were arrested, with 25-year-old David Agiular and 24-year-old Ronald Galarza facing criminal trespassing charges while 31-year-old Jimmy Chiang facing an additional charge of criminal mischief. One of the culprits spoke to a reporter from Connecticut's Fox affiliate as he was being taken into police custody, saying that he wanted to 'take it home, put it up'. When asked where he would put it up, the would-be thief gave an unlikely answer: 'in a museum or something'. The more likely answer would be to sell the street art. Banksy bought this painting from a charity shop and then added the Nazi officer and signed his signature below that of the original artist, and it eventually sold for $615,000 . Drawing a crowd: Throughout the day on Tuesday, spectators began to realize that the picture hanging in the charity shop window was actually made by the famed graffiti artist . The elusive artist took a painting from a charity shop and added a seated Nazi officer before returning it to the same shop and allowing them to auction it off for a six-figure sum. HousingWorks, a New York-based charity that helps the homeless and those living with HIV/Aids, sold the painting through an online auction house and after two days of open bidding, the final price came to $615,000. 'It’s such a great gesture, what he did today is really special. He may be controversial,  but there is no controversy in the fact that it goes to something good,' the charity's spokeswoman Rebecca Edmondson said at the time.","British street artist made a different graffiti installation around New York for each day in October .

An award-winning British cheese-maker which produces cheddar for Prince Charles’s Duchy Originals label has been forced out of business – with the blame put on supermarkets. Denhay Farms has produced its famous West Country farmhouse cheddar for more than 50 years. For the past four years it has sold to supermarkets, including Waitrose, Tesco and Morrisons, but the family business is now making its last wheel of cheddar after being ‘unable to secure a commercially viable price across all sectors of the market’. Out of business: Denhay Farms will stop making its farmhouse cheddar after half a century . George Streatfield, who with wife Amanda took over Denhay in 1977 from his father, a co-founder of the business in Bridport, Dorset, said the decision to close was ‘heartbreaking’. Cheddar, he said, had become extremely competitive and being forced  to reduce costs and margins by buyers while production costs were rising had made it impossible for the business to continue. Denhay, which has won more than 100 awards, had been sold in Waitrose under the Royal seal of Duchy Originals since 2009. Supplier: Denhay produces cheese for the Duchy Originals brand founded by Prince Charles, pictured yesterday . It will also cease production of its traditional farmhouse whey butter, but will continue to sell milk and organic bacon, which was awarded the Royal warrant by Prince Charles in 2011. Independent cheese-maker Mary Quicke said: ‘Cheese-makers who supply to supermarkets aren’t making  any money.’ Waitrose, which recently featured Denhay cheese in an advertisement with celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal, said: ‘Waitrose always pays a fair return to our suppliers, and we have a long history of supporting small and artisan food companies.’","Denhay Farms has been making West Country cheddar for 50 years .

"By . Peta Bee . UPDATED: . 06:39 EST, 8 February 2012 . Downward dog for back pain, sun salutations for an energy boost - yoga has become the workout for a healthy mind and body, and is the exercise of choice for endless celebrities including Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. But is the ancient art form as healthy as we’d like to think? On yesterday’s Today programme on Radio 4, New York Times science writer William Broad, the author of a controversial new book, The Science Of Yoga: The Risks And Rewards, asked whether yoga - when taught incorrectly - might actually have the potential to kill. Bent out of shape: New York Times science writer William Broad yesterday asked whether yoga - when taught incorrectly - might actually have the potential to kill . During his research Broad - who himself practised yoga for many years before getting injured doing it in 2007 - uncovered endless documented examples of injuries to backs and limbs such as strains, broken bones and trapped sciatic nerves. He also found to his ‘horror’ that while some poses were low risk others could have extremely serious consequences. These risks, he says, occur as a result of hyper-extension - over-stretching - of the head and neck. It’s not just doing advanced postures such as headstands, where you balance your legs straight up in the air, resting on just your head and hands, that are risky, says Broad. He’s gathered evidence that even traditional yoga moves, or asanas, practised at beginner and intermediate level, can lead to serious problems. ‘This is not anecdotal and they are not freak accidents,’ he says. ‘Postures like the shoulder stand, in which you lie on your back and raise your legs into the air, and the plough, in which you lie on your back and put your feet over your head on the floor behind you, that are widely performed can crank the neck around in a risky way.’ Reductions of blood flow in one of the vertebral arteries, called the basilar artery, are known to cause strokes in some people and can be fatal. ‘If the clots that form go to the brain, you can have a stroke,’ Broad says. ‘And one in 20 people who have these vertebral artery problems can die.’ He explains that the first real evidence of yoga injuries was initially published in credible medical journals several decades ago. As long ago as 1972, a respected Oxford University neurologist, Professor Ritchie Russell, wrote an article in the British Medical Journal arguing that some yoga postures had the potential to cause strokes in healthy, young people. He had found evidence that yoga students typically turned their necks as far as 90 degrees, double what is considered a normal, healthy rotation. Such excessive extension of the head and neck, Russell said, could harm the fragile arteries running along the neck, causing clots, swelling and constriction. In theory, he said this could produce serious problems in the brain. Followers: Brad Pitt and his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston both partake in yoga as their exercise of choice . In 1973, a spinal rehabilitation expert at Cornell University Medical College described the case of a 28-year-old woman who suffered a stroke while doing a yoga move known as the wheel or upward bow in which a person lies on their back and then lifts their body into an arc, balancing on the hands and feet in a sort of back-bend. Instead of allowing the head to hang in this position, many people tense and move their necks in an attempt to create balance, a move which can dangerously backfire. A few years later another paper, this time in the Archives of Neurology Journal, detailed the case of a 25-year-old man who was rushed to hospital with loss of control in the left side of his body and blurred vision. Again, yoga was to blame. The patient had been performing daily . asanas every morning, including spinal twists in which participants lie . or sit on the floor and twist their upper body in the opposite direction . to their lower body to stretch the spine, as well as shoulder stands, . often maintaining the positions for five minutes. Doctors wrote that a series of bruises down his lower neck were a result of trauma ‘caused by repeated contact with the hard floor surface on which he did his yoga exercises’. Examinations revealed he had suffered a stroke after his left vertebral artery became blocked, preventing blood from reaching his brain. While he recovered the ability to walk, his hand function remained damaged. Over the years, Broad says that there is an increasing amount of ‘real data that medical and government communications have gathered’ confirming yoga’s risks. In 2001, the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine published an article citing yoga as one of the many possible causes for arterial damage in susceptible patients. Broad also cites a 2009 survey of US yoga therapists, teachers and doctors that looked at the most common yoga-related injuries. The researchers from Columbia University found that while back injuries were, predictably, the most usual, the next most common in declining order of prevalence were shoulder injuries, knee problems, neck injuries and then strokes. ‘The respondents noted four cases in which yoga’s extreme bending and contortions resulted in some degree of brain damage,’ Broad writes. ‘The numbers weren’t alarming, but the acknowledgement of risk pointed to a decided shift in the perception of the dangers yoga posed.’ So common are yoga-related injuries that they are even being recognised in medical dictionaries. Dangerous? In 2001, the New England Journal of Medicine published an article citing yoga as a possible cause for arterial damage in susceptible patients . Broad highlights the case of a young man who was relatively experienced at yoga and spent several hours a day in a kneeling position known as vajrasana - something that is not advised for long lengths of time. After a few weeks, he had difficulty walking or climbing stairs and went to see his doctor for an explanation. He was told that the kneeling posture had prevented oxygen from reaching a branch of the sciatic nerve that runs from the lower spine through the buttocks and legs. As a result, the nerve had become temporarily deadened and, after seeing several other cases of the same injury, doctors named the condition ‘yoga foot drop’. Glenn Black, a yoga teacher for nearly 40 years, who spoke to Broad when he was doing his research, says he has seen everything from pinched nerves, lower back tightness and injuries to hips and knees - and worse - among yoga regulars. He says moves such as the chaturanga - a challenging pose similar to the plank in which all four limbs and the core abdominal muscles support the body - can create repetitive use injuries in the shoulder. He adds that moves with deep knee flexion . such as deep squats, which are a feature of many standard yoga . postures, can strain ligaments and tendons. Lifting the head - instead of letting it hang - during arm balances, in which you support the entire body with the hands on the floor, can also restrict blood flow to the brain and around the body, Black says. Any asanas involving flexing, extending and rotating the lower back and cervical spine can cause problems. ‘It’s a myth that it’s safe to do an asana without awareness and consciousness,’ Black says. Indeed he has come to believe that ‘the vast majority of people’ should give up yoga altogether. Furthermore, he is convinced that people are ending up in hospital because they have underlying physical problems that make serious injury more likely. Instead of doing yoga, they should be doing specific exercises to strengthen these weaker parts of their bodies. But is Broad being alarmist? In the UK, the growth in the number of people taking part in yoga - it is now thought to be close to one million - has predictably led to a growth in related injuries, according to  the Society of Sports Therapists, but there are no reported cases of anyone suffering a stroke as a result of yoga exercises. Defenders claim its links to injury and pain can mostly be caused by  poor teaching. Yoga is woefully unregulated in the UK and anyone can become an instructor after completing a weekend course. Pierre Bibby, chief executive of the British Wheel of Yoga, the national governing body says: ‘Yoga is not bad for you, but bad teaching is.’ The BWA’s own instructors undergo a minimum of two to four years’ tuition. Others blame the fact that yoga has become too competitive. ‘People push themselves too far,’ says Mollie McClelland, a yoga teacher at the Alchemy Centre in London.  ‘And there are such huge egos in yoga that everyone wants to prove a point.’ Broad agrees that yoga does have benefits.

To help players navigate the interactive world, Ordnance Survey has also published a list of coordinates to various UK markers, including Stonehenge in Wiltshire. The map was built using OS OpenData - maps and mapping tools that Ordnance Survey lets developers use to develop alternative maps. Minecraft was created in 2009. At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite . game world.' They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves. Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape. Players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. As a player progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different materials. The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available.

Darren Feldman’s manager Chris Oates also repeatedly invited him to JuJu, an exclusive champagne bar on London’s King’s Road and mocked Jewish Tottenham football fans. Mr Oates also said he wanted to run past the club’s White Hart Lane stadium wearing an Arsenal top with ‘IVOR 4 SKIN’ printed on the back. Referring to Lord Sugar’s son Daniel, with whom he was negotiating a deal, Mr Oates said: 'Quite frankly they’re all a bunch of Yids. I’d like to lock them in the building and gas them all.'

Mr Feldman, of Teddington, south-west London, was awarded £15,000 for injury to feelings and £5,000 for lost earnings. Speaking after the tribunal, Mr Feldman said: 'I am very relieved by this outcome. I was so disturbed by my treatment at HCA and it is a shame the company fought this to the end.

And in a way, it is. For the story comes from the past of the actor who plays the detective, Benedict Cumberbatch. Newly uncovered records have revealed that the actor’s great-great maternal uncle Henry was tried for murder when he was only 14. Mysterious: While Benedict Cumberbatch (left) solves crimes in Sherlock, the case involving his great-great uncle is a mysterious blot on a family tree that includes Henry Carlton (right image, left), a naval commander . Henry Ventham, a farm hand, was accused of stabbing to death his friend, Frederick Betteridge. The story appeared in the Hampshire Advertiser on Saturday, 18 November 1893, with the headline The Romsey Stabbing Case. It details how Henry was defended by a barrister called Bullen, the Recorder of Southampton, on the instructions of the judge, Mr Justice Hawkins. Henry and Frederick were out gathering nuts and blackberries one afternoon when it was thought they had an argument – and Frederick was stabbed. Cumberbatch's family history also includes Abraham, a slave-owner, and Benedict described his role as emancipation campaigner Pitt the Younger in Amazing Grace as an 'apology' for his ancestor . Henry’s story, supported by a third boy, was that there was no quarrel and that Frederick suddenly ran against him and the knife went into him. A jury accepted Henry’s version that it was an accident and found him not guilty of both murder and manslaughter. The Hampshire Advertiser concluded its report with the comment: ‘His Lordship … was quite content with the view they had taken of the case (applause in court).’ The comment in brackets suggests the jury’s verdict was a popular one. The intriguing story was unearthed by family history website, findmypast.co.uk. Cumberbatch, 37, who recently starred in Star Trek into Darkness, had a privileged upbringing and was educated at Harrow. On his father’s side, he is descended from a prominent English family who were merchants and adventurers in the 18th and 19th centuries. His grandfather, Henry Carlton Cumberbatch, was a highly decorated naval commander who fought in both world wars. But Abraham Cumberbatch, Benedict’s fifth great-grandfather, was a slave owner, who founded the family fortunes on a sugar plantation in Barbados. Today there are many Cumberbatches descended from slaves who took their name from the family which once owned them. In 2006, Cumberbatch starred in a film about the abolition of slavery called Amazing Grace. He described his role, as prime minister William Pitt the Younger, as a ‘sort of apology’ for his ancestors. Debra Chatfield, a family historian from findmypast.co.uk, said: ‘Though Benedict’s paternal ancestry is well known and documented online, this startling discovery is quite the revelation. ‘It seems that there was a dark horse in Benedict’s family tree, and while his great-great uncle was not convicted of murder or manslaughter, it shows us how many curve balls family history can throw at us.’","Henry Veltham, great-great uncle of Cumberbatch, tried for murder .

All 12 MEPs in Nick Clegg’s party backed an increase in EU spending from a deal agreed earlier this year, despite calls from political leaders in the UK for austerity to apply at home and abroad. It is embarrassing for Mr Clegg, who tried to claim credit for securing the budget cut, and comes ahead of EU leaders meeting for talks tonight on the budget and boosting growth. Embarrassing: Nick Clegg, pictured on ITV Daybreak, claimed credit for the budget cut, which his own MEPs have voted to reverse . Support: George Lyon MEP backed the budget increase along with fellow Lib Dem Fiona Hall . MEPs were voting on a plan from the European Parliament to spend a massive €142billion next year, some 2 per cent more than national governments agreed in February. While Labour, Conservative and UKIP MEPs voted against the bigger budget, all Lib Dems backed it. While the budget will be 5 per cent lower than last year, it will still be €855million higher than the deal secured by Mr Cameron at crunch talks early this year. Leaders of Europe’s national governments agreed on a total €908billion budget limit for 2014 to 2020 - about 3 per cent lower than the current seven-year period. Last night MEPs voted on the first year of the 2014-2020 budget round, and voted for a 2 per cent increase on what the European leaders agreed. Prime Minister David Cameron is in Brussels tonight for talks on curbing spending and cutting red tape . The decision by the Lib Dems to endorse extra EU spending while defending cuts in the UK appears at odds with Mr Clegg, who in February boasted: 'I spent months making the case for the tough approach that we took with politicians around the European Union.' Shadow treasury minister Cathy Jamieson said: ‘Nick Clegg must explain why the Lib Dems voted yesterday for an increase in the EU Budget. ‘At a time when families in Britain are facing a cost of living crisis and the deficit is high, we need restraint and reform of the EU Budget. ‘That's why Labour MEPs voted against the European Parliament's proposal for a higher budget. And it's why we pushed for a real terms cut last year and defeated David Cameron in a vote in the House of Commons.’ However, the Lib Dems insisted they had secured a cut to the budget - just not as big as national governments wanted. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ’Not a single Lib Dem MEP voted to increase the Brussels budget. They voted to cut it by 5.4 per cent, cutting £8billion from EU spending. ’Lib Dems also led cost-saving measures which cut £24million from MEP expenditure, supported a cut of £30billion from the seven-year budget, and backed a cut of 5 per cent in staff and pension costs to save a further £8billion over eight years.’ In February Mr Cameron celebrated a major diplomatic coup in Brussels after securing the first EU spending cut in its history. During 26 hours of talks, the Prime Minister also fought off attempts, led by France, to slash Britain’s rebate. Mr Cameron’s deal will save UK taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds on what  they would have been forced to pay under the European Commission’s initial plans to increase the budget. However, our annual contributions will actually increase – because of Tony Blair’s decision to surrender a chunk of the rebate, won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984, in return for reform of agricultural spending which never materialised. Split: Members of the European Parliament are at odds with the leaders of Europe's national governments over the size of the Brussels budget . Mr Blair agreed in 2005 that investment spending in new eastern European members, which is rising as a proportion of the EU’s budget, should no longer be subject to the rebate. EU leaders meet in Brussels today and tomorrow to discuss ways to improve growth and competitiveness across Europe. Brussels red tape is ‘throttling’ British business, David Cameron has warned ahead of the talks. The Prime Minister is to push for a one-in, one-out rule, to halt the growth in EU regulations. Ahead of the meeting, Open Europe published a list of the 100 most costly EU regulations to the UK economy using data from the UK Government’s impact assessments of these rules. It concludes they cost the economy £27.4billion a year - more than what the UK Treasury expects to raise in revenue from council tax. In at least 24 cases, the Government’s own impact assessment finds that the estimated costs outweigh the estimated benefits - meaning that they impose a net cost on the UK economy.","All 12 Lib Dem MEPs defy national governments to demand 2% rise in 2014 .

A monstrous Halloween storm will inflict torrential rains, howling winds and booming thunderstorms from Texas to the Midwest and as far as the Northeast, forecasters have predicted. It will mean wet and windy celebrations for trick-or-treaters across the U.S., with as many as 42 million people battling thunderstorms across cities including Nashville, Houston, Cincinnati and Indianapolis. The thunderstorms could be capable of dropping several inches of rain in just a few hours, sparking flash flooding from eastern Texas into the lower Mississippi Valley, Accuweather reported. High winds could also down trees and power lines across the eastern Great Lakes into the upper Ohio Valley into the Northeast, the Weather Channel warned. Scroll Down for Video . Frightening forecast: A trick or treater walks past a table of skeletons at the National Zoo in D.C. Forecasters have warned that celebrations will have to contend with thunderstorms, heavy rainfall and winds tonight . Forecasters warned residents against going near downed power lines as they could be live and dangerous. 'Damaging winds and some tornadoes will be possible with what should be a complex and potentially messy storm,' the Storm Prediction Center predicted, USA Today reported. 'The potential for widespread damaging winds… and possibly a few tornadoes will increase throughout the day.'

Heavy winds are also expected to batter the country, with Lakes Erie and Ontario expected to see gusts of 60 mph into the early hours of Friday, AccuWeather reported. Coupled with the wet ground, trees could topple. The East Coast, including Boston, Washington D.C. and New York City, will see a calmer Halloween but will still be lashed with rains late on Thursday. And on the West, revelers will mostly see a dry night, bar a few showers across Seattle and Portland.

Rose tinted glasses: Leonid Brezhnev was ridiculed during his leadership as the butt of a thousand jokes, but has enjoyed posthumous popularity . Russians have voted for their most popular ever leader - and the former Soviet ruler Leonid Brezhnev topped the poll. He beat tyrant Joseph Stalin and the country’s last tsar, Nicholas II, to claim top prize. The poll which was published in the Kommersant daily shows that Brezhnev, who ruled from 1964 until his death in 1982, topped the list with 56 percent saying they had a positive view of him. Famed in the West for his bushy eyebrows, Brezhnev was responsible for a tightening of political repressions after his predecessor, Nikita Khrushchev relaxed some of the Soviet regimes more oppressive policies. His reign included the Era of Stagnation - a period during the mid 1970s that saw Russia's economic problems ignored as military spending soared. He also oversaw a period of growing global influence for the Soviets towards the latter stages of the Cold War. He loved military medals and ensured he was awarded more than 100, including the Order of Victory, which he was was the only person to receive outside of World War Two. It was posthumously revoked in 1989 as he did not meet the criteria for citation. He ruled for 18 years until his death at the age of 79. Stalin, who was responsible for the murder, torture and repression of millions came second with 50 percent. 'Although no one would want to live in the Stalin era, he stands for what’s lacking today – justice and equality in fear,' Kommersant quoted Valery Solovei, a professor of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, as saying.

Philip Goodeve-Docker, pictured training for the trip, died in Greenland during a -70C snowstorm . The friends of a novice Arctic explorer who died during a fundraising trek across Greenland said they huddled together for warmth as they battled 'minute by minute' to survive a -70C snowstorm. Philip Goodeve-Docker, 31, died as he . and his friends Roan Hackney and Andy Norman endured a 155mph blizzard that battered their camp for more than 40 hours. Speaking at Mr Goodeve-Docker's inquest today, Mr Hackney, who suffered severe frostbite, said: 'We were just trying to stay alive, minute by minute. 'It was not a game. It was not human versus human. It was human versus the elements.' Mr Goodeve-Docker succumbed to the extreme cold and was . found frozen to death by a rescue team who had battled for 24 hours to . find the men, and airlift them to safety in a helicopter. Mr . Hackney and Mr Norman, who both narrowly escaped death, made their way . into court today still bearing their frostbite injuries as they gave . evidence to a coroner about the tragedy. The . month-long charity mission was only in its second day when the huge . blizzard hit, blowing gusts of 155mph at temperatures as cold as minus 70 degrees Celsius, the coroner heard. Mr . Goodeve-Docker, a novice explorer, was inspired to go on the on once in . a lifetime expedition by his late grandfather, a former vice- president . of the Royal Geographical Society who had funded the 400-mile polar . across Greenland’s barren ice sheet. The . 31-year-old from Ealing, London, had written on Facebook that he had . been 'training furiously' for the mission, which was set to raise tens . of thousands of pounds of charitable funds for the Queen’s Nursing . Institute. He added: 'Part . of my reasons for this frankly nutty adventure is my grandfather, . Patrick Pirie-Gordon, who passed away two years ago.' Andy Norman (centre) and Roan Hackney (right) arrived at their friend's inquest today still bearing their frostbite injuries . Mr . Hackney, an experienced polar explorer, told the inquest how the men . were airlifted to Greenland on April 25 after the start of the adventure . was delayed by five days due to bad weather. 'We had a clear window of opportunity and we were advised to take it by the Greenland authorities,' he said. 'We . had all the necessary kit for the expedition, everything that’s . required to survive in a polar environment for a month, or two months if . necessary, on a sledge which we dragged behind us.' The men walked with skis for four . hours on the first day and set up camp for the night in a specialised . polar tent designed with three separate compartments each with an escape . route if the weather closed in. The following day, Mr Hackney said they awoke at 8am to a 'total whiteout' which cleared later that morning. 'We proceeded to cover as much ground as possible,' he said, explaining that they managed to ski for another four hours. 'At 7.30pm, my experience suggested to me it was time to set up camp because there was a storm coming,' he added. However, nothing could have prepared the men for the 'relentless' snow storm which battered them for the next 40 hours. The month-long charity mission was only in its second day when the huge blizzard hit, blowing gusts of 155mph at temperatures as cold as minus 70 degrees Celsius, the coroner heard. Andy Norman (left) and Roan Hackney (right) are still injured after their ordeal . Mr Goodeve-Docker had a layer of ice covering his head when his body was found by rescuers . Mr . Hackney said they planned to 'sit out the storm' but became concerned . when tent poles were swept away by the huge blizzard, which brought a . heavy snow drifted that started to crush the tent. He . told how Mr Norman, an IT professional from Ascot, Berks., and Mr . Goodeve- Docker kicked the sides of the tent from the inside to try and . clear the build-up of snow that was turning their accommodation into a . frozen prison. Several times, Mr Hackney said he tried to clear snow by venturing outside but was forced back inside each time. The final time he tried, the shovel was ripped out of his hand and blown away into the distance. He . said: 'I was now becoming aware all sides of the tent were becoming . covered in snow, sleet and ice. There was no sign of abatement. 'The tent was literally crushed within seconds.' Mr . Norman used a satellite phone to alert Mr Goodeve-Docker’s family in . Chilbolton, Hants., to the emergency as the men lay on top of each other . in the porch of the tent with the snow engulfing them from all angles. Mr Hackney said he thought all three of them were going to die in the storm. He said: 'It was not a game. It was not human versus human. It was human versus the elements. 'We were just trying to stay alive, minute by minute. He . said snow started entering the porch, burying and choking them. Despite . this, he said he tried to keep spirits up by making his partners repeat . their names back to him and indulging them in a sing-song. 'It was excruciating but we had a sense of purpose and we were determined to stay alive,' he said. 'It was horrible to be able to do nothing about it. I was desperate my team should make it. We had no intention of dying.' After . many hours battling to cling on, Mr Goodeve-Docker became submerged in . the snow and died a few hours before rescuers arrived. The . inquest heard that the surviving pair then slipped into unconsciousness . and were minutes away from death themselves when a break in the storm . meant a rescue team could land in a helicopter in 60mph winds and get . them out to a hospital at noon on April 28. The . inquest held in Basingstoke, Hampshire, heard that Mr Goodeve-Docker’s . body was found in a frozen state in a sitting position covered in a . layer of ice. Coroner Andrew Bradley said a post-mortem examination was carried out 'many hours later' when the ice had melted. Novice trekker Philip Goodeve-Docker, 31, froze to death while waiting for rescue from a storm with temperatures reaching -70C and 155 mph winds an inquest has heard . A pathologist found he had died from respiratory and circulatory failure as a result of hypothermia.Giving . evidence, Mr Norman said: 'The start was pretty idyllic really in terms . of the weather. Everything had been going to plan and it carried on . that way with a few challenges until the storm hit us when we were in . the tent. 'From then on, it changed quite dramatically.' Coroner Andrew Bradley expressed his 'great sadness' as he recorded a verdict of misadventure. He appeared choked and emotional as he revealed he knew Mr Goodeve-Docker personally. He said: 'It’s a matter of great sadness. This family is known to me and has been known to me for many years.' He added that the storm had been 'all consuming', and said: 'The appalling events which led up to the death are recalled very graphically by Andy and Roan. 'The best preparation was taken to stand up to the velocity of the storm. 'We have heard about the destruction of the environment, the destruction of the tent and everything that lay in its way, and eventually the destruction of Philip. 'The rescue did not arrive in time for Philip. Fortunately the other two have survived and thank God for that. 'Never was a verdict of misadventure so appropriate.' Family members of the deceased and the two explorers declined to comment to reporters after the hearing.","Philip Goodeve-Docker was trapped with Roan Hackney and Andy Norman .

Since there is a possibility that more bones can be found, we are suspending the burials until we are certain that all bones were collected.

And, as the glossy PR photos demonstrate, Marina Chapman can also pull off a passable impression of a chattering primate. But is her exotic life story bananas? That’s for you to decide. The housewife, who lives in Bradford, has spoken publicly for the first time about a bizarre chain of events that — she claims — saw her raised in a South American rainforest by capuchin monkeys. Jungle behaviour: Marina Chapman who says she was raised by capuchin monkeys . Mrs Chapman, a grandmother who was born in Colombia in the Fifties, says she spent five years of her childhood living with a ‘family’ of the tree-dwelling monkeys in the north-east of the country. In a memoir published later this month, she says she was four years old when kidnappers abducted her from the garden of her family home and left her for dead in a rainforest. Two days after she was abandoned, Mrs Chapman (who moved to the UK as an adult) says a group of monkeys discovered her lying alone, ‘curled up on the ground in despair’. They soon began looking after her, she says. Some fought off hostile predators, issuing ‘screams . . . so intense and horrific that I hid under a bush’. Others taught her how to survive by scavenging bananas, figs, nuts and other wild food. Over time, she says she developed ‘dry, leathery’ skin and powerful ‘sinewy’ arms and legs, learned how to sleep in a ‘hollowed-out piece of tree trunk’, and discovered an ability to communicate in their rudimentary language. Monkey love: It is believed that the monkeys who took care of Marina Chapman in the forest were weeper capuchins . ‘I imitated the noises the monkeys made for my own amusement,’ Mrs Chapman recalls. ‘But I soon realised that sometimes a monkey — or several monkeys — would respond. ‘So I practised the sounds that they made . . . If there was an immediate danger their call would be even higher — a sharp, high-pitched scream, which was usually accompanied by the slapping of hands on the ground.’ The claims, made public when a portion of Mrs Chapman’s autobiography, The Girl With No Name, was serialised yesterday in The Mail on Sunday, have met with a mixed reaction from primate experts. ‘I can accept that a four-year-old child could imitate the feeding behaviour of wild capuchin monkeys and that they would not harm the child,’ the zoologist Desmond Morris tells me. ‘In that way she could just about have survived. I have myself hand-fed wild capuchins in a forest in Central America.’ But, Morris adds, ‘the idea that they might have helped me in any way seems far-fetched’. In one remarkable passage of the book, Mrs Chapman, who does not know her exact age, but believes she is now in her 60s, claims one of the elder monkeys saved her life after she had eaten some poisonous berries. The animal, who she gave the nickname ‘Grandpa’, led her to a muddy stream and submerged her head to demonstrate that she should drink the brackish water. ‘I began coughing and then vomiting — great heaving gouts of acid liquid that burned my throat,’ she recalls. Though highly unpleasant, ‘the purging worked’, she believes, because it forced the poisoned berries from her stomach. Living among the monkeys, Mrs Chapman found herself ‘growing filthier and filthier,’ and ‘scratching more and more . . . I became home for all manner of little creatures. Not only was my skin growing drier and scalier, I was also soon crawling with fleas’. After what she estimates to have been five years, she was rescued from the jungle by a party of hunters who drove her to Cucuta, a large city in the north-east of Colombia near the Venezuelan border. There, aged nine, she began calling herself Luz Marina. After narrowly escaping being sold into prostitution, she spent her teenage years with a group of homeless street children in an organised petty crime ring. Wild child: Marina at home in Bolton Abbey, North Yorkshire, in 2009, climbing onto a tree-trunk hole, similar to those in which she would find a bed during her time in the jungle . Later, she found work as a housekeeper. Her initial employer abused her. But she was then taken in by the working-class family of a local woman called Maruja Eusse, who found her work with some cousins in Bogota. The family, who worked in textiles, later attempted to emigrate to the UK. In 1978, they spent six months in Bradford, where she met and fell in love with John Chapman, the organist at an evangelical church where she worshipped. They married shortly afterwards, when Marina was in her late 20s, had two daughters, and for the ensuing three decades have lived inconspicuously in tidy, three-bedroom semi in Allerton, a suburb of Bradford. Mrs Chapman’s bizarre but incredible story only emerged last October, after she signed to Andrew Lownie, a well-known London literary agent who has represented everyone from Gloria Hunniford and Norma Major to David Hasselhoff and Kerry Katona. Lownie negotiated a lucrative book deal with the publisher Mainstream, and arranged for Lynne Barrett-Lee, an author who is also one of his clients, to ghost-write the manuscript. Rights to Marina’s autobiography have now been sold in seven countries. Initial coverage of the book deal saw Mrs Chapman widely compared to Mowgli, the young protagonist in Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book, along with Tarzan, the baby bought up by apes in the novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs. But the unlikely nature of her tale also sparked understandable scepticism. There is, after all, little to corroborate the claims about her five years in the jungle, and cynics have wondered if the tale has been spectacularly embellished as part of a lucrative hoax. They point out that there is no contemporary coverage of her disappearance or survival story. And some sceptics have also noted that the average four-year-old girl is far larger than the capuchin monkeys who allegedly ‘adopted’ Mrs Chapman. However, despite extensive investigations, no evidence has been unearthed to definitively prove that her tale is a fantasy. Indeed, most primate experts say it has at least half a ring of truth to it, since capuchins are generally well-disposed to humans. One of the generally-cuddly animals was for a time owned by Ross Geller, the character played by David Schwimmer in the TV sitcom Friends. Another is currently the property of pop singer Justin Bieber. ‘Some aspects of the story might indeed be true, as monkeys and humans share some similar facial displays, cognitive abilities and behaviours, and can indeed ‘bond’ together quite tightly, if the right conditions occur,’ says Dr Bonaventura Majolo, a primate expert from the University of Lincoln. ‘However, some other aspects are pure fantasy. For example, I don’t think there is any evidence of “active” teaching in monkeys and some of the explanations for the events described in her story appear to be very anthropomorphic — ascribing human emotions and feelings to monkeys.’ Whatever the truth, occasional cases of children being raised by primates have certainly been documented in the past. Family tree: Marina and her husband John with their two daughters Vanessa, left, and Joanna, far right, in in St Ives, in 2012 . In 1991, the ‘Ugandan monkey boy,’ six-year-old John Ssebunya, was rescued after three years in the wild, being cared for by vervet monkeys. And in 1996, a two-year-old Nigerian called Bello was found living with chimpanzees. Mrs Chapman’s claim to have been kidnapped also seems vaguely credible. Though the apparent date of the abduction, in 1954, pre-dates Colombia’s civil war, child kidnappings were commonplace in the region at the time. Friends add that if her story is an invention then it certainly isn’t a recent one: she has been privately talking about her extraordinary experiences for decades. In October, a Sunday newspaper travelled to Colombia and tracked down Nancy Forero Eusse, the granddaughter of the woman who ‘rescued’ Mrs Chapman in Cucuta in the Sixties. Nancy recalled how ‘Marina Luz’ had often shared her story of being raised by monkeys. At the time, the future Mrs Chapman would like to spend her afternoons sitting in the branches of a mango tree. ‘It was such a curious thing,’ recalled Ms Eusse. ‘She would hang out in that tree. Not just in the branches, but high up, right at the top.’ After moving to Yorkshire and starting a family, Mrs Chapman worked part-time at the National Media Museum, and at a local nursery, remained active in her evangelical church, and started a small catering company. She never shared her remarkable story with colleagues and neighbours, perhaps because her English wasn’t quite up to it, but often discussed it with her husband, a bacteriologist, and daughters Vanessa and Joanna. Their mother’s past was evident in her child-rearing techniques, they recall. ‘When we wanted food, we’d have to make noises for it,’ her younger daughter, Vanessa, has said. On occasion, Mrs Chapman would bring furry mammals into the house, including rabbits, which she caught in hedgerows using her bare hands. ‘I got bedtime stories about the jungle, as did my sister. We didn’t think it odd — it was just Mum telling her life. So in a way it was nothing special having a mother like that.’ It was Vanessa, who works in TV, who persuaded Mrs Chapman to write an account of her childhood. It ended up in Mr Lownie’s hands after she cold-called his agency. Even if the tale is invented, Mrs Chapman wasn’t motivated by greed: her proceeds from publication of the book have been promised to a charity that works with street children. Meanwhile, the National Geographic channel is now planning a documentary in which they will return to the jungles of Columbia with Mrs Chapman. Perhaps she’ll meet a few  old friends.",Marina Chapman claims she was raised by capuchins in Colombia .

A Russian gangster planned to build a mansion with the huge profits he made by shipping at least 13 sex slaves into the UK. Sergey Konart, 42, plotted to construct an enormous house in Bulgaria with girlfriend Ekaterina Kolesnikova, 28, from the income of their £100,000 a year human trafficking ring. At Southwark Crown Court today Konart was ordered to pay back £150,000 of the £200,000 he netted running the racket. The Russian smuggled more than a dozen women into Britain from Eastern Europe under false identities over three-and-a-half years. Sex traffickers Sergey Konart (left) and girlfriend Ekaterina Kolesnikova. Konart was ordered by a judge at Southwark Crown Court to pay back £150,000 of the £200,000 he made by running a human trafficking ring . He and Kolesnikova then forced them to work in brothels in Chelsea and Earls Court, west London, to pay off alleged debts of up to £80,000, charging clients up to £200 a visit. The women were threatened into submission with violence and plied with ecstasy and cocaine. Last year Konart was jailed at Southwark Crown Court for ten years and Kolesnikova was locked up for two-and-a-half years for her part in the ‘substantial commercial enterprise.’ He was told today by Judge John Price that he must pay back the cash within six months or face a further year and nine months behind bars. Konart has already paid more than £50,000 back. Kolesnikova, who has been released from prison but remains in detention in relation to immigration issues, earned £100,000 for her role. But she was ordered to pay back just £30. Judge Price ordered the money, held in a bank account in her name, should be paid within seven days. Two victims of the couple told the court last year they had been promised a ‘better life’ working as a cleaner and a waitress, only to be forced to become prostitutes. Sergey Konart was ordered to pay back £150,000 at Southwark Crown Court in London today . Hanna Llewelyn-Waters, prosecuting, said building plans for a mansion in Bulgaria were discovered in a raid on one of the premises. She described the operations as ‘organised and sophisticated’ with women being smuggled via Germany and Italy before reaching the UK. The women were housed in one of seven properties rented by Kolesnikova, an Uzbekistan national, using one of her many aliases. The prostitutes were given working names and makeovers before posing in lingerie for photographs, which were then used to advertise their services on the internet. Many willing sex workers agreed to hand over half of their takings but some were tricked into travelling to England. The prosecutor said: ‘They were preyed on as they were vulnerable, with promises of waitressing and cleaning, a better life. ‘Eventually they were told the real purpose of coming to this country - they were going to be working in the sex industry. Knaresborough Place in Earls Court, where one victim was led by Sergey Konart and put to work at £150 an hour . 'These women were effectively enslaved by a debt bondage into working as prostitutes at the defendants’ behest. ‘They were told they could leave but would have to pay substantial debts. ‘Threats were made to their families. ‘There were concerns their families could be targeted by the other ends of the criminal network in Russia. ‘There was little faith held by the complainants, in the Russian police.’ The workers’ takings were collected on an almost daily basis, paid into banks and diverted out of the country. ‘At least £340,000 was transferred by these defendants,’ added the prosecutor. ‘Largely out of the country.’ She said several thousand dollars was found stashed in a safe deposit box in Knightsbridge, £10,000 at one of the properties, and £3,000 on Konart’s person. One of Konart's victims arrived at Heathrow Airport in late 2007 on a false Polish identity . Ms Llewelyn-Waters added: ‘Jewellery and loose jewels were found, and Kolesnikova has made more than £158,000 of transfers through various aliases.’ One of the victims, who arrived at Heathrow Airport in late 2007 on a false Polish identity, was led to a flat at Knaresborough Place in Earls Court before being put to work at £150 an hour. She estimated she earned at least £200,000 for her captors between then and July 2009, when she escaped. On one occasion she said she heard Konart ‘talking to his mother about a mansion they were building from money earned in the United Kingdom'. ‘Police did find plans for a mansion being built in Bulgaria’, said the prosecutor. Konart, of Sloane Court East, Chelsea, admitted conspiracy to traffic women into the UK for sexual exploitation, a similar conspiracy within the UK, conspiracy to control prostitution for gain, two charges of possessing criminal property, and removing criminal property from the UK. Kolesnikova, also of Lower Sloane Street, admitted conspiracy to control prostitution, three counts of possessing false identity documents - one with intent, and removing criminal property. The conspiracy ran between 1 July 2007 and 15 December 2010.","Sergey Konart, 42, and girlfriend Ekaterina Lolesnikova, 28, ran a £100,000 a year human trafficking ring .

This image, created by London-based design scientist Melissa Sterry, shows the bedroom of the future. It features beds that monitor health and bedsheets that respond to changes in temperature. One day there could even be a holographic companion that can read bedtime stories to soothe people to sleep . In September, the National Sleep Foundation released its first international Bedroom Poll. It compared the amount of sleep and attitudes, habits and bedtime routines of people living across the United States, Canada, Mexico, UK, Germany and Japan. The results discovered that while a third of Britons prefer to sleep naked, Germans have to air their bedrooms weekly to achieve a good night's sleep and half of both Japanese and Americans take naps every two weeks to catch up on their shut eye. The innovations in the futuristic designs were based on the results of a study carried out by The Sleep Council. It asked more than 2,000 people what they most want to see in bedrooms of the future. All the technologies are currently being worked on and developed in research centres across the UK in one form or another. The most-desirable technology, according to the study, was self-cleaning and bacteria-resistant mattresses that can sterilise germs at 47 per cent. In second place, with 42 per cent of the votes, were mattresses and bedsheets fitted with adaptive materials able to heat up when its cold, and cool down automatically when its hot, in response to a person's body temperature. A third of people want to see smart beds that track vital statistics while a person sleeps, which can warn them if they have an infection, an oncoming cold and even if they're about to have a heart attack.

Among stations criticised was Birmingham-based Peace TV - co-owned by Dr Zakir Naik (pictured) Hardline Islamic extremists are using fringe British TV channels to call for terrorism, murder and the torture of homosexuals. A series of little-known channels have been severely criticised for allowing ‘inflammatory’ material to be broadcast. Among the cases is an Islamic scholar who told viewers that it is their ‘duty’ to ‘kill those who insult Prophet Mohammed’. In another a woman presenter said homosexuals should be beaten and tortured for the ‘evil, shameful act.’ Ofcom, the communications watchdog, found the stations broke the broadcasting code by allowing the extreme opinions to be aired unchallenged. But the breaches highlighted fears that extreme Muslim speakers, previously confined to mosques, could reach larger audiences. The rulings came despite a 2010 report warning extremist material was being broadcast on channels aimed at Muslim communities. It found the Islam Channel, Britain’s largest Islamic broadcaster, had continued to ignore rules about impartiality and allowed controversial viewpoints to be aired. Tala Rajab, who wrote the report for Quilliam, an anti-extremist think-tank, told the Sunday Telegraph the ‘shocking’ incidents raised serious questions over broadcast regulation. He said: ‘If this had happened in a mosque the police would be right in pursuing a criminal investigation. ‘But because they are being broadcast on television channels for some reason there seems to be little appetite for looking into these extreme messages. ‘If these kind of comments were made against black people, for example, you can imagine a channel being shut down overnight, particularly if they had incited violence against a minority.’ Among the shows criticised was one broadcast by Birmingham-based Peace TV, co-owned by Dr Zakir Naik, who was banned from entering Britain in 2010 for the ‘public good’. It broadcast the phrase: ‘One group of scholars, they say that if a Muslim, if he becomes a non-Muslim he should be put to death.’ Dr Naik, who is based in Mumbai, put a sermon online in 2006 which said ‘every Muslim should be a terrorist.’ Another broadcast by Noor TV was criticised by Ofcom for ‘serious breaches’, and highlighted how inflammatory talk can incite violence. The show said: ‘There is absolutely no doubt about it that the punishment for the person who shows disrespect for the Prophet is death. No one disagrees about this.’ Ofcom found the stations broke the broadcasting code by allowing the extreme opinions to be aired unchallenged . Last December Radio Asian Fever, in Leeds, was fined £4,000 for breaching broadcasting rules in programmes involving a presenter called ‘Sister Ruby Ramadan’. She told listeners homosexuals should be beaten and tortured, adding: ‘Torture them; punish them; beat them and give them mental torture.’ Takbeer TV, based in Nottingham, has been found in breach of the code twice in 18 months for programmes which denigrated a minority Muslim sect. Ofcom said the minority group were labelled a ‘disease’ and ‘monstrous’ intentions and it will now consider an ‘appropriate’ punishment. The channels have small audiences compared with the mainstream and are aimed at Muslim communities, with some content broadcast in Urdu and other languages. In some cases the channels also breached a rule that they must keep recordings of all output, raising the possibility other inflammatory material was broadcast undetected. An Ofcom spokesman said: ‘The majority of Islamic channels comply with our rules. However, where we identify issues through our monitoring or complaints we investigate fully and take firm enforcement action.’","Ofcom found stations broke broadcasting code by allowing extreme opinions to be aired unchallenged .

On trial: Martin MacNeill is accused of hounding his wife to get plastic surgery before knocking her out with drugs and leaving her to die in a bath tub . The testimony came during the murder trial of Martin MacNeill, 57, a former doctor who prosecutors say hounded his wife to get cosmetic surgery then knocked her out with painkillers, Valium and sleeping pills before leaving her to die in the tub. Utah medical examiner Todd Grey yesterday testified that he could not determine her exact cause of death but said it could have come from a heart attack combined with drug toxicity. Prosecutors called Cragun and another expert to suggest Michele MacNeill's death must have involved foul play. 'My opinion is that Michele died as a result of drowning,' testified Joshua Perper, a forensic pathologist from Florida. Conflict: Utah cardiologist David Cragun (left) said Michele MacNeill was not at risk of heart attack, but medical examiner Todd Grey (right) believes the woman could have died from a heart attack combined with drugs . Anna Walthall, a mistress of Martin MacNeill, previously testified that he once described over 'pillow talk' how he could induce a heart attack in someone that would appear natural. One of Grey's subordinates initially ruled that Michele MacNeill's 2007 death was natural from heart disease, and that she had high blood pressure and was developing myocarditis, or inflamed heart tissue that could have interfered with a normal heart rate or rhythm. Investigative findings prompted Grey to change the autopsy finding to undetermined - and to add that drug toxicity may have played a role. That opened the way for the murder charge against Martin MacNeill.

A tiny push at a skewed angle can send an astronaut floating off in the wrong direction. Even a single strand of hair can be enough to propel a body away from a surface, as Nasa astronaut Karen Nyberg recently demonstrated. In a video created to explain the effects of weightlessness, Nyberg used one strand of her own hair to send herself tumbling away from a wall of the International Space Station (ISS). Scroll down for videos... Even a single strand of hair can be enough to propel a body away from a surface, as Nasa astronaut Karen Nyberg recently demonstrated . Nyberg said that the experiment came about following a conversation fellow astronaut Cady Coleman had with Sandra Bullock, star of the film space thriller ‘Gravity.’ ‘One of the things she told her about was how little effort it took to move around in microgravity,’ said Nyberg, who has been at the ISS since May. ‘She even told her that you could take a human hair and use it stretched out to push against a wall or a handrail – and it really takes that little effort.’ Veteran astronaut Catherine 'Cady' Coleman floated some ideas about how Bullock could portray an astronaut for blockbuster Gravity . ‘Since I have the resources, I thought I would give it a try,’ added Nyberg in a video posted by Nasa. After plucking one hair, she pressed it against an ISS handrail and fell backwards in slow motion. Bullock sought tips for portraying microgravity from Coleman, who’s logged more than 4,330 hours in space aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia and the International Space Station. Coleman wouldn’t be qualified to talk about the terror of floating off into space, as luckily she’s never experienced it. But she was able to field Bullock’s questions about how it feels to be an astronaut. In a video created to explain the effects of weightlessness, Karen Nyberg used one strand of her own hair to send herself tumbling away from a wall of the International Space Station (pictured) She told collectSPACE: ‘She wanted to know about what it is like to physically live up there and physically move around. ‘“What would you do with your hands? With your feet? What would be a natural position to work? How often do you see your crewmates? Where do you meet each other?"" It was those kinds of things.’ Coleman has seen the trailer to Gravity and describes the scene where Dr Stone is sent spinning into the void as sensationalism, but admitted to collectSPACE that the film is valuable as it portrays 'real people, including women, doing a difficult job'.","Karen Nyberg wanted to show how little effort it takes to move in space .

"By . Gareth Finighan . UPDATED: . 03:04 EST, 29 December 2011 . Russia's Foreign Ministry has attacked America's human rights record in its first report on injustice elsewhere in the world, offering examples such as the Guantanamo Bay prison and wrongful death row convictions to paint the U.S. as hypocritical for lecturing other nations on the subject of rights. 'The situation in the United States is a far cry from the ideals that Washington proclaims,' says the newly-released report. Moscow has previously reacted angrily to the accusations of human rights breaches that the U.S. State Department has leveled at Russia in its annual reports. Fiercest critics: U.S. President Barack Obama, left, shakes hands with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin at a 2009 meeting. Both countries have accused the other of abusing human rights . The State Department has expressed concern about the violent attacks on rights activists and journalists in Russia, most of which go unpunished and has also criticised abuses in Russia's Caucasus, including extrajudicial killings, kidnappings and torture. And last week thousands of protesters . took to the streets of Moscow to demonstrate against elections believed . to have been rigged in Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's favour. The Putin regime has come under fire recently for a series of high-profile abuse cases. In October, the widow of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko won the right for a public inquest into the death of her husband, suspected of having been fatally poisoned after defecting to the UK. Before his death, Litvinenko had accused Russia's secret services of staging terrorist acts. He also accused Putin of ordering the murder of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya. Abuse of power? Russia has condemned the fact that the 'notorious' Guantanamo Bay prison is still operational . The 90-page Russian report slams EU nations, Canada and Georgia, but reserves its longest section of 20 pages for what it says are violations by the U.S. The report does not cover Asia, Africa or the Middle East, other than a five-page section criticising the Nato operation in Libya. Moscow laments the ongoing operation of the 'notorious' prison in Guantanamo Bay, where terrorism suspects have been held since the September 11, 2001 attacks, and criticises President Barack Obama for 'legalising indefinite and extrajudicial custody and the return of court martials'. The report accuses the U.S. of prying into citizens' personal lives and violating the rights of Muslim Americans in the fight against terrorism. It also points to errors made by American courts. Legalised murder? The report pointed out that many inmates on death row in the U.S. were later found to be innocent . 'Judicial errors are the Achilles heel of American justice as concerns capital punishment,' the report argues. It notes the roughly 130 people sentenced to death in the past 30 years who were later cleared of the charges, some after they were executed. The Foreign Ministry also struck back at international criticism of Russia's recent parliamentary election, which independent observers said involved widespread fraud. Outrage over the vote set off a spate of protests led by citizens unhappy with Vladimir Putin's rule. The report accuses the U.S. of blocking independent candidates from elections and criticises the practice of allowing governors to nominate senators when a Senate seat is vacated, as when Obama became president. It refers to the conviction this year of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was accused of trying to auction off Obama's Senate seat.",Moscow slams Washington over Guantanamo Bay and innocent death row inmates .

A Utah beauty queen has been arrested for hurling home-made bombs containing toxic toilet cleaner at houses in a south Salt Lake County community. Kendra McKenzie Gill, who was crowned Miss Riverton in June and was set to compete in the Miss Utah pageant, was taken into custody with three friends - John Patrick Reagh, Shanna Marie Smith and Bryce Christopher Stone - on Saturday. Police have accused the four 18-year-olds of making the devices - using water bottles filled with aluminum foil and toilet bowl cleaner - and ditching them at at least two homes in Riverton, including the residence of Stone's ex-girlfriend. Disgraced: Kendra Gill, left with her mother and right in her mugshot, was arrested for throwing bombs at houses . Crowned: Gill, pictured, was crowned in June as Miss Riverton . 'They were throwing them at both property and people,' Unified Fire Authority Captain Clint Mecham told KUTV. 'This goes well beyond a teenage prank.' Residents began calling authorities at around 10:50 p.m. on Friday after seeing the teens chucking the bombs from a vehicle and hearing loud explosions. When investigators arrived on the scene they discovered four plastic water bottles with remnants of aluminum foil and a chemical substance, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. The water bottles had been detonated in a road and a driveway. Witnesses who called the cops reported seeing a dark-colored, gray or black vehicle with a dent on the front cruising by the house and someone inside throwing four bombs, which caused the blasts. Scene: The teens were found to have thrown the bombs at two residences, including that pictured, in Riverton . Pals: Bryce Stone, left, and John Reagh were also arrested and admitted to buying plastic bottles, aluminum foil and household chemicals at a local store before building the bombs and throwing them from their car . Police then received reports of further . explosions at a second home in the area, and witnesses there reported a . similar car and its occupants ditching devices. Witnesses said the car was similar to that driven by Stone, and the vehicle was later found in front of the teen's residence. Also caught: Shanna Smith, pictured, was also caught throwing the bombs . Stone . claimed he and his friends had been 'pranking' with fireworks. He was . arrested and allegedly implicated Gill, Smith and Reagh. Investigators . discovered remnants of a case of water bottles with labels and sizes . matching the debris at the scenes of the explosions, according to the . Tribune. A roll of aluminum foil and toilet bowl cleaner was also found . in the vehicle. All four of the teens, including the beauty queen, admitted to buying the bomb-making supplies at Walmart, and creating the devices before chucking them at the two Riverton addresses. The explosions failed to cause damage at either home and no one was injured, police said. But Mecham said things could have turned out far worse. 'They're very caustic, very nasty. So they can cause injury to somebody just if the chemicals get on somebody, much less the fragmentation of the shrapnel damage that can be caused,' he said. 'They can very easily cause serious harm or even death.' He added to The Tribune that the case was being taken very seriously. 'Anytime you're dealing with explosives and incendiary devices, those are always felony charges,' Mecham said. 'The fact that there are multiple (detonations) of them, makes this extremely serious.' The four remained in Salt Lake County jail on Sunday afternoon and bail hadn't been set. Each teen faces 10 counts of of setting off an incendiary device - a first degree felony.","Kendra McKenzie Gill was arrested with three friends - John Patrick Reagh, Shanna Marie Smith and Bryce Christopher Stone - on Saturday .

But the TV presenter, who is showcasing her latest collection for Isme in the photographs, has revealed that like every other women she has body hang-ups and would kill for the figure of someone half her age. Speaking in an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the 52-year-old said: ‘I have a strange shape; I am like Ten Ton Tessie. I would love Abbey Crouch’s amazing figure, she is tall and slim and dresses brilliantly but I am never going to look like her.’ New campaign: Carol Vorderman, 52, looks young beyond her years as she poses in figure-hugging dresses for her new Isme campaign . But Carol sure gives 27-year-old Abbey a run for her money in the modelling stakes in her latest campaign for clothing brand Isme, for whom she has been a style ambassador since February. Speaking about the new AW13 range, she said: ‘It is glittery with plenty of satin and lace – perfect for the party season but less in-your-face. ‘The range has glamorous and casual pieces and beautiful coats.’ Carol was surrounded by male models in her latest shoot so it's no surprise she admitted posing for the snaps wasn't a chore. Body idol: Carol says she loves Abbey Crouch's figure (R) but admits she will never look like her and instead focuses on emphasising the best parts of her body . She said: 'I really enjoyed this shoot. The boys were a laugh and it's nice for us all to seek a little bit of fun and glamour to lift our spirits.' Carol, who cites her favourite designers as Victoria Beckham and Roland Mouret, says her ultimate wardrobe essential is high-waisted trousers. ‘Jeans with a low-slung bum are in fashion but they’re difficult to wear. You have to be tall, slim and toned and I’m none of those,’ she said. Sharing her top tips for looking glamorous over the party season, she advises women to look at their strong points and emphasise them. Body confident: Carol shows off her slimline figure in the new campaign images but maintains she doesn't do any exercise to stay in shape . Glamorous: The TV presenter belies her 52 years in this figure-hugging dress, £65, from the new party range . ‘Your shape does change in your fifties but it is a great time to get back into fashion. It’s important to make the most of your best parts and wear colours that suit you; I’d never advise wearing a miniskirt for example. ‘When you’re in your twenties you have supermodels shoved in your face but when you’re 50, you are what you are and shouldn’t try and compete with your daughter,’ she said. Carol describes her own style as ‘eclectic’ and explains: ‘I always get photographed when I am leaving a restaurant so I am wearing a particular style - usually a dress and heels. ‘But when I am home in Bristol I just throw on a leather jacket, jeans and ankle boots.’ Perks of the job: Carol said she enjoyed working with the male models on the new shoot . Carol maintains that she ‘does nothing’ to keep her figure in check. She said: ‘I went on a zip wire recently where I had to be weighed – I had a fit. ‘I hadn’t weighed myself in 15 years and I looked at the scales and had put on 18 pounds. I thought “that can’t possibly be right!” ‘I will lose it by Christmas, I am going on a no alcohol detox,’ she said.

Youthful: The inseparable pair say they could not live without each other, with Daisy crediting her youthful outlook on life to her younger man . Frank died from emphysema when Daisy was 72 and the former shop assistant was convinced she would spend the rest of her life alone. But then only a few months later David, a local carpenter, moved in to the same block of flats in Attleborough, Norfolk, and the pair started dating. Daisy, who has three children John, 78, Susan, 75, and Rosemary, 72 and three grandchildren Martin, Anthony and Nicole and is also a great-grandmother to Fraya, 14, Charlie, one, and 15-month old, said: 'David offered to cut my lawn for me - he was the perfect gentleman from the start. 'Then everything went from there. I would offer to make him a cup of coffee or he would say do you want to come round for a drink. 'I thought he seems like a nice chap and so a romance started. New love: When Daisy's first husband died after 50 years of marriage, she thought she would never find love again but met David at 72 and married him nine years later . Doting: The pair insist the age gap has never been an issue - and that they still enjoy a busy and active lifestyle together going on plenty of trips abroad . 'I thought I would never find love again after Frank died but David just happened to come into my life. It was wonderful. 'I wouldn't have been alive if I'd been a lonely widow I wouldn't have cooked for myself or anything like that.' After nine years of dating, David proposed and the happy couple have been married for 18 years. David, who was in his 40s when he met Daisy and had not previously been married, said: 'I was just a local lad looking for a partner when I found Daisy. 'We had been together for a little while and I didn't know what to get Daisy for her birthday so I just said ""Why don't we get married"" so we did. 'We had a lovely service on Daisy's 82nd birthday.' Single: David, who was in his 40s when he met Daisy and had not previously been married, said: 'I was just a local lad looking for a partner when I found Daisy' Young at heart: Daisy was already married with three children before David was even born but they have a great life together and she does a daily crossword to keep her mind active . The pair are keen holidaymakers and have visited numerous countries including Canada, Egypt and Portugal and they regularly enjoy days out to beach-side town Great Yarmouth. David says Daisy is still as sharp as ever and always does the daily crossword. He said: 'She's just like she has always been. She's very sharp. We enjoy days out together all the time. 'Her legs aren't that good anymore, but apart from that she's fine. 'The age gap has never been an issue with us. We always just loved each other and that was all that mattered.'

We all make mistakes as teenagers that we would like to forget, but health and safely officer Roger has to live with his written all over his chest. Roger, now 31, from North Yorkshire, had a bulldog tattooed on his chest when he was just 15. Years later he lived to regret the decision but an attempt to have it removed made his situation even worse. From bad to worse: When Roger tried to have to tattoo removed, he ended up with unsightly blisters when the treatment went wrong . When he was 26, he was injected with a chemical solution that was supposed to push the tattoo ink out of his skin, ridding him of his youthful mistake. However, his body reacted badly to the treatment and he was instead left, not only with the tattoo still visible, but with unsightly bumps and scars on top of it. Not only that, the treatment was incredibly painful and he needed to apply cream every day to sooth the damaged skin. Mistake: Roger got the tattoo on his chest when he was 15 . It also dented his self-esteem and made him too embarrassed to show his chest. 'It's all one big ball of embarrassment and a self-esteem killer,' he admitted. Roger enlisted the help of the TLC TV show Last Chance Salon to see if they could help him. Skin expert Dr Sam Bunting was horrified by the condition of Roger's skin. She said: 'To be left with such a mess after one treatment is quite shocking.' Shocking: Last Chance Salon expert Dr Bunting was surprised by the state of Roger's skin . No pain, no gain: She recommended Roger to have laser therapy treatment to remove the tattoo . Dealing with the problem with a skin graft was ruled out because this would lead to further scarring so Dr Bunting instead recommended Roger have a series of laser treatments. However, she warned him this was not a simple solution as laser therapy can be extremely painful creating a hot, stinging sensation on the skin. Roger would need thousands of laser shots into the area over a number of treatments to remove the tattoo. He would then need steroid injections to reduce the scarring. On the mend: Roger's tattoo is now fainter, right, after laser therapy but he will still need steroid injections to rid him of the blisters . Gaining in confidence: He's delighted with his progress and can't wait till the tattoo is a distant memory . Returning to the Last Chance Salon after the first phase of laser treatment, the colours of the tattoo were already fading and Roger's self-confidence returning. Dr Bunting said: 'He's a great example of how getting on the path of recovery can lead to an internal transformation.' While Roger will still need further laser treatments and the steroid injections before his skin problem is completely resolved, he said he's delighted with the progress so far. 'The problem that was hovering over me I can really see it disappearing now,' he said. Watch Last Chance Salon on Thursdays at 10pm on new entertainment channel TLC (Sky 125 and Virgin 167).

Nina Blakemore, who used to eat just an apple a day to starve herself in the hope of becoming a size zero model, is now a healthy size 18 and has a successful plus-size modelling career . For years Nina, 35, from Wolverhampton, West Mids, starved herself in the hope of launching a career in the fashion industry. But despite making herself ill, Nina claims she was told she was 'too big' for the modelling agency she wanted to join. 'I wanted to become a model so desperately that I thought starving myself was the only option. 'I lived off an apple a day and would exercise vigorously.' Nina said: 'My hair was falling out and I looked awful as my health started deteriorating. My mood swings were horrendous - I was so unhappy. At 5ft 10in Nina (pictured in her early 20s) would eat just an apple a day to starve herself down to a size zero but was devastated when she claims she was told she was still too big to be a model . 'My mum could see how skinny I’d become and she witnessed first-hand the effects an eating disorder were having on my body. 'We went to the doctor and from there I was referred to a therapist.' Finally, after a year-long battle, Nina began eating properly again, allowed herself to gain weight and started to regain her confidence. Since then she hasn’t looked back. Nina reverted to her natural curvy shape and has been working with Ford Models' 12-plus division. She now refuses to weigh herself as part of her healing process and has experienced a fantastic career working all over the world - including jobs in New York and India.

Gay marriage will be legal in some British churches by 2014, despite furious Tory warnings that the issue could split the party and cost it the next election. In a surprise move, the Church of England will be guaranteed a blanket exemption from holding same-sex marriages. But this failed to quell a major Tory backlash. Amid stormy scenes in the Commons, Equalities Minister Maria Miller vowed to fast-track plans to legalise gay marriage, saying the change was needed to keep the institution of marriage ‘vibrant and relevant to society’. Scroll down for Maria Miller's statement to the House... Culture Secretary Maria Miller promised a 'quadruple legal lock' to prevent the Church of England from being forced to hold gay weddings . She confirmed a government U-turn on . the issue which will allow religious institutions, such as the Quakers, . that want to conduct gay marriages to ‘opt in’ to the law and hold . ceremonies in their churches. But unexpectedly, she announced there . would be a specific legal ban on the Church of England and Church of . Wales holding gay weddings. Mrs Miller said this would give the Church ‘iron-clad’ protection against legal action by gay rights campaigners. Other religious institutions, such as . the Catholic Church, will also be allowed to refuse to hold ceremonies . for same-sex couples, as will individual vicars. Mrs Miller said the . legislation would include a ‘quadruple lock’, meaning no church will . ever be forced to conduct a gay wedding unless it wants to. The legal . protections include: . - A guarantee that no religious . organisation or individual minister can be compelled to marry same-sex . couples or to permit this to happen on their premises. -  A legal bar on allowing ministers . to marry same-sex couples unless their organisation’s governing body has . expressly opted in to provisions for doing so. - Amendment of the Equality Act 2010 . to ensure no discrimination claim can be brought against religious . organisations or individual ministers for refusing to marry a same-sex . couple. - An explicit statement that it will . be illegal for the Church of England and the Church in Wales to marry . same-sex couples and that Canon Law, which bans same-sex weddings, will . continue to apply. In the Commons, gay former justice minister Nick Herbert said same-sex marriage was backed by the public, but he was heckled by Tory MP Peter Bone who insisted it is not . Legislation will be published next . month. Ministers expect it to take up to 12 months to get through . Parliament, with the first gay marriage ceremonies taking place in early . 2014. But furious Tory MPs warned the . legislation would undermine the institution of marriage and cost the . party votes. Andrew Selous, ministerial aide to the Work and Pensions . Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, warned Mrs Miller that the proposal was . ‘directly contrary to what Jesus said about marriage’. Former defence minister Gerald Howarth . said ministers had ‘no right whatsoever’ to alter the definition of . marriage as being the union of one man and one woman. Fellow Tory Stewart Jackson said the . Government’s consultation process, which brushed aside a petition . opposing the move signed by 600,000 people, was a ‘constitutional . outrage’ and ‘reminiscent of a Liberian presidential election’. In an open letter to David Cameron . last night, senior Tory MP Brian Binley warned the issue could split the . party and cost the Conservatives the next election. Mr Binley said the issue was driving . supporters away, adding: ‘I am perturbed that our chances of winning the . next election are compromised by the pursuit of issues which serve to . divide the party, and detach the leadership from its support base in the . country.’ Nigel Farage leader of the UK Independence Party, said the issue would be at the heart of his election campaign. 'David Cameron's proposal has the potential to rip apart the traditional rural Tory vote. While UKIP wholly respects the rights of gay people to have civil partnerships, we feel the prime minister's proposals will present an affront to millions of people in this country for whom this will be the final straw,' he told The Guardian. 'The division between city and rural is absolutely huge. In my village pub in Kent they are just completely against.' Free vote: Labour leader Ed Miliband has granted Labour Mps a free vote on the issue . All Tory MPs, including ministers, are . to be given a free vote on what Mrs Miller described as an ‘issue of . conscience’. Privately ministers believe at least 40 per cent of Tory . MPs oppose the legislation. In another surprise move, Labour said . it would give its MPs a free vote. Only Liberal Democrat MPs will be . whipped to support gay marriage. But Labour condemned the decision to . put a legal block on the Church of England. Shadow home secretary Yvette . Cooper said: ‘Why is the Government now rowing backwards on equal . marriage? Having said churches would be able to hold same-sex marriages . if they wanted to, they now say it will be illegal for the Church of . England to do so even if it wants to in future. How can that be freedom . of religion?’ Speaking on behalf of the Church in . the House of Lords, the Bishop of Leicester Tim Stephens said: ‘Marriage . is not the property of the Government nor is it the property of the . Church. While the forms and legalities around marriage have evolved over . time, one fundamental feature has remained the same throughout – that . marriage is a union of one man and one woman.’ Archbishop Vincent Nichols, the leader . of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, and Archbishop Peter . Smith, the Archbishop of Southwark, voiced their opposition in a joint . statement. ‘The meaning of marriage matters,’ they said. ‘It derives that meaning from its function as the foundation . of the family. The union of one man and one woman for love and mutual . support and open to procreation has over the centuries formed a stable . unit we call the family.’ Opponents condemned the Government’s consultation on the issue and warned that ministers could face a High Court review. And veteran human rights campaigner . Peter Tatchell denounced the exemption for the Church of England and the . Church in Wales as ‘disappointing’, saying it  could be open to legal . challenge. He said: ‘Exempting the official . established Church sends the wrong signal. There is no reason why these . churches should be treated differently from other faiths. Discriminating . between faith groups is probably illegal under the Human Rights Act.’","Equalities Minister Maria Miller vowed to fast-track legalisation plans .

Scientists are to create mutant forms of the H7N9 bird flu virus that has emerged in China so they can work out the risk of a lethal human pandemic. Highly transmissible and deadly forms of H7N9 will be made in several high security laboratories around the world - but it is vital to prepare for the threat, the scientists say. The new bird flu virus, which was unknown in humans until February, has already infected at least 133 people in China and Taiwan, killing 43 of them, according to the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) data. Members of staff at a chicken slaughter house in the suburb of Shanghai, China . Announcing plans to start the controversial experiments, leading virologists Ron Fouchier and Yoshihiro Kawaoka said H7N9's pandemic risk would rise 'exponentially' if it gained the ability to spread easily among people. The only way to find out how likely that is, and how many genetic changes would need to take place before it could happen, is to engineer those mutations in laboratory conditions and test the virus's potential using animal models, they said. 'It's clear this H7N9 virus has some hallmarks of pandemic viruses, and it's also clear it is still missing at least one or two of the hallmarks we've seen in the pandemic viruses of the last century,' Fouchier told Reuters. The new bird flu virus has already infected at least 133 people in China . 'So the most logical step forward is to put in those (missing) mutations first.' Writing in the journals Nature and Science on behalf of 22 scientists who will carry out various aspects of the H7N9 work, Fouchier said because the risk of a pandemic caused by a bird flu virus exists in nature, it was critical for risk-mitigation plans to study the likely mutations that could make that happen. This kind of science is known as 'gain of function' (GOF) research. It aims to identify combinations of genetic mutations that allow an animal virus to jump to humans and spread easily. By finding the mutations needed, researchers and health authorities can better assess how likely it is that a new virus could become dangerous and if so, how soon they should begin developing drugs, vaccines and other scientific defenses. Yet such work is highly controversial. It has fuelled an international row in the past two years after it was carried out on another threatening bird flu virus called H5N1. Infectious particles of the avian H7N9 virus emerging from a cell. Scientists who sparked an outcry by creating easier-to-spread versions of the bird flu want to try such experiments again . When Fouchier and Kawaoka announced in late 2011 they had found how to make H5N1 into a form that could spread between mammals, the U.S. National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) was so alarmed that it took the unprecedented step of trying to censor publication of the studies. The NSABB said it feared details of the work could fall into the wrong hands and be used for bioterrorism. A year-long delay on such research followed while the World Health Organisation, U.S. security advisers and international flu researchers sought ways to ensure the highest safety controls. The laboratory Fouchier will be working in is known as a BSL3 Enhanced lab (Bio-Safety Level 3), the highest level of biosecurity that can be achieved in academic research. 'Nature is the biggest threat to us, not what we do in the lab. What we do in the lab is under very intense biosecurity measures,' he said. The experiments aim to identify combinations of genetic mutations that allow an animal virus to jump to humans and spread . 'There are layers upon layers of layers of biosafety measures such that if one layer might break there are additional layers to prevent this virus ever coming out.' Fouchier said research has been 'under fire' recently. 'One of the accusations against the flu community was that we were not transparent enough about what experiments were being done, and why and how they were being done,' he said. 'We're trying to pre-empt such accusations this time.' The H7N9 bird flu outbreak currently appears under control with only three new human cases in May, after 87 in April and 30 in March. Experts say this is largely thanks to the closure of many live poultry markets and because of warmer weather.Yet as winter approaches in China, many experts believe H7N9 could re-emerge, meaning the threat of a pandemic looms if it mutates to become easily transmissible between people. Wendy Barclay, an Imperial College London flu expert, said it would be ludicrous to shy away from such studies. 'This type of work is like fitting glasses for someone who can't see well,' she said. 'Without the glasses the vision is blurred and uncertain, with them you can focus on the world and deal with it a lot more easily.'","Deadly forms of H7N9 will be made in high security labs around the world .

A woman whose husband of 16 years committed a serious sexual offence while he was married to her has spoken of the devastating impact of his crimes. Maureen Johnson, from Reading, spoke of her husband's arrest, imprisonment and subsequent five-year run from the law on on ITV’s This Morning. Maureen says that her life was 'ruined' when she discovered, in 2008, that her beloved partner was in fact a sexual predator. Scroll down for video . Maureen Johnson was married to Nigel Burnell for 16 years and says she had no idea he was even capable of such a crime . Nigel was confronted in Portugal, where he was on the run, by criminologist Mark Williams-Thomas as part of ITV's documentary series On The Run . As amazing as it might seem, Maureen says she had 'no idea' Nigel even had the capacity to commit such an act. ‘You can spend 16 years of your life with someone and still not know them, it’s very strange,' she admitted. Maureen told of the devastating aftermath: ‘For a long time it left me unable to trust anybody. I still don’t, I still can’t have a relationship and keep that relationship going. Damaged I think is the word. ‘The fact that the story is out on national television is giving me satisfaction and closure. It’s what I call karma.’ Nigel Burnell, 49, was convicted of a serious sexual offence in 2008 and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. He was released after serving half his sentence, but breached the terms of his early release after going on the run to Portugal. Staying off the radar in Portugal, at times living in a tent, Nigel was able to evade capture for four years. Mark (left) says that sex offenders are often masters of deception, something Maureen (right) must agree with - she had no idea her husband was capable of such a crime . Maureen was unable to get a divorce for the years her husband was missing, leaving her in limbo. However, before his crimes came to light, the couple had been very happy. Speaking about their early whirlwind . romance, Maureen says: ‘We met in May and we were engaged by November . and married the following April. ‘He . was everybody’s friend, everybody loved Nigel. Everybody knew him as . Taf, he was a very lovable guy. We got on really well and I really did . love the guy.' Maureen, who had moved from her home town of Reading to Wales with Nigel, says that Nigel’s actions destroyed her life. ‘I couldn’t afford the mortgage once he had been arrested and put in prison. It was a matter of my family saying ""come back to Reading where you‘ll be loved and wanted""'. The exact nature of Nigel’s crimes cannot be revealed for legal reasons. Maureen spoke on This Morning about her and Nigel's whirlwind romance, and says she feels his arrest is karma . After a dramatic confrontation with criminologist Mark Williams-Thomas as part of ITV’s documentary series On The Run, Nigel was eventually arrested by Portuguese police and brought back to the UK.

A new study suggests those born under the Gemini star sign have the best chance of becoming wealthy, while Scorpios are the least likely to succeed. The intriguing find was unearthed by researchers who studied the star signs of the top 1,000 richest people in England. Write caption here . While they were fairly evenly spread over the 12 signs of the zodiac, there was a higher concentration of Geminis than any other sign. They represent 10 per cent of the group and include Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Tom Jones and Jamie Oliver. All of them were born in early summer - between May 21 and June 21- but it is not known why this would be an advantage to wealth-creating. The analysis was based on a preview of the 25th Sunday Times Rich List, which will be published on April 21. Geminis topped the horoscope league for the third year in a row with 9.9 per cent of our richest. But bottom of the pile were Scorpios, with only 6.5 per cent, The Sun reported. They include Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and Paul McCartney’s third wife Nancy Shevell who has a lucrative stake in her family’s US transport business. Unusual: Roman Abramovitch is one of the richest men in Britain but he is a Scorpio . Capricorn was the second richest sign, with 9.6 per cent. Third with 9.4 per cent was Aries, then Taurus (8.9%), Leo (8.6%), Sagittarius (8.2%), Cancer (8%), Pisces (7.9%), Libra (7.8%), Aquarius (7.7%) and Virgo (7.5%). Last year’s rich list was topped by steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal – a Gemini – who was worth an estimated 12.7 billion. He was followed by Uzbek-born Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, a Virgo, who was worth £12.3 billion. The 1,000 biggest fortunes in the UK in 2012 totalled £414.26billion, up 4.7 per cent on the previous year. The list featured 77 billionaires, compared with just 53 in 2010. It also featured a record 108 women, up from 105 last year. Ex-model Kirsty Bertarelli was the richest woman in the UK and has the star sign of Cancer. Her position was thanks to the £7.4billion fortune she shares with her Swiss-born husband Ernesto - whose family made its money in pharmaceuticals.","Capricorn was second richest sign with 9.6 per cent .

Evidence: Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former spin doctor, appears at the Leveson inquiry today . Tony Blair took three calls from Rupert Murdoch during the frenetic run-up to the Iraq War, his former spin chief confirmed yesterday. But Alastair Campbell insisted that the then Prime Minister was never told what to do by the media mogul. He told the Leveson Inquiry into media standards that, in the three calls, he believed Mr Murdoch had just wanted ‘a chat about what is going on’. He added: ‘I was never witness to and don’t believe there was ever a discussion that said, “Now, Tony, if you do this and this and this, my papers will back you”. It just never happened.’ Mr Blair faced criticism that his government had placed few restrictions on the operation of News Corp’s newspapers or BSkyB, in which News Corp owned a 39.1 per cent stake, during his time in office. Mr Campbell admitted Mr Blair was grateful for Mr Murdoch’s backing, particularly during the build-up to the 2003 Iraq War, when the Prime Minister was accused of following U.S. leader George W Bush blindly into war. Scroll down for video . Charm offensive: Tony Blair with News Corp boss Rupert Murdoch who he tried to win over in the run-up to the 1997 election. The Sun switched support to the Labour party . He said: ‘It was perfectly clear that . most of the media were opposed to what we were doing and Mr Murdoch’s . titles were in favour, and I think it’s also fair to say that the Prime . Minister would have appreciated that support.’ Asked why Mr Blair made time for three . calls during a period of frantic diplomacy, Mr Campbell said: ‘What I . think was going on is that Rupert Murdoch has placed a call and Tony . Blair has taken that call, and Rupert Murdoch is just wanting to have a . chat. ‘He is a news man. I . think it is a combination of Rupert Murdoch trying to find out what is . going on and also probably saying, “You know, we’re going to support you . on this”.’ Mr Campbell said Cabinet Office records showed the two men had spoken on the phone a total of only six times between 2002 and 2005. He conceded that Mr Blair would have been ‘crazy’ not to want the media mogul’s backing but denied the two men had made a deal in 1995, when the Labour leader attended the News Corporation annual conference on Hayman Island, off Australia. In written evidence to the inquiry, he said: ‘It’s simply not the case to say no big decision was taken without Murdoch’s reaction being taken into account. ‘I could list dozens of policy decisions on which he would have had no advance knowledge, from Budgets to Queen’s Speeches to peace processes and military action.’ Mr Campbell said Mr Murdoch had tended to use the back door during his visits to Downing Street, but said other visitors had  employed the same method of entry if they wanted to avoid cameras outside the front door. Mr Murdoch’s former right-hand man Les Hinton hit back yesterday at a parliamentary committee which had accused him of ‘selective amnesia’ while giving evidence into phone hacking. In a damning report, MPs claimed the ex-chairman of News International had misled Parliament and was ‘complicit’ in a cover-up over the scale of the scandal at the News of the World. But Mr Hinton described the findings as ‘unfair, unfounded and erroneous’ and demanded that the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee’s allegations be withdrawn. Press reform: Alastair Campbell told the Leveson inquiry today he thought there was a lack of political will to reform the way the media is regulated . The Leveson inquiry website was today apparently brought down by hackers as Alastair Campbell gave evidence. The website provides live video coverage of the hearing as well as copies of witness statements. On Twitter users were blaming hacking group Anonymous - but no one had claimed responsibility for the site. Anonymous and Lulzsec have previously claimed they have hacked into government and News International websites. Users said the website homepage had gone blank - although others were having no difficulties getting on it at all. It is possible that rather than being hacked there was an internal problem with the website. A spokesman for the inquiry said they were investigating the problems. Lack of political will: Michael Gove said the Leveson inquiry had given rise to a 'chilling atmosphere' which threatened freedom of speech in the UK . Alastair Campbell also said that David Cameron did not want to set up the Leveson inquiry and there was a lack of political will to reform press regulation. Mr Campbell said comments made at a Westminster lunch by Michael Gove in February were part of a wider Government strategy. The Education Secretary said the inquiry had given rise to a 'chilling atmosphere' which threatened freedom of speech in the UK. When . asked if there was a political will to regulate the media, Mr Campbell . replied: 'No, if I'm being frank. I thought that Michael Gove's speech . to the parliamentary gallery was part of the political strategy. 'I don't think that David Cameron particularly wants to have to deal with this. 'I don't think he wanted to set up the inquiry. He had to in the end. 'I . think it will be very difficult for him not to go along with whatever . recommendations - or at least a very large part of the recommendations - . the inquiry produces. But I don't think there's much of an appetite.' Meanwhile, Mr Campbell said that Mr Blair and . other members of the Labour government had long believed there was a . 'real problem' in the relationship between the press and politicians.However, they did not take action to address the issues. 'I think there was a political point . of pragmatism that Tony Blair would have taken the view that it was not . politically sensible,' he said. 'It is no secret that this was one of . the few things that we argued about.' He added: 'He was further of the view . that whereas it was possible to fight and win elections and to govern . with consensus with some of the media offside, to seek to do so with all . of them offside and in kill mode is very difficult indeed.'","Campbell denies Labour changed policies to win support of Murdoch papers .

As the self-styled lady of the manor, Kelly Hadfield-Hyde may be more accustomed to issuing orders than receiving them. So when a guard at an airport security scanner asked her to remove her clothing before passing through she took his request a little too literally. She began to peel off her clothing – only stopping when she had removed her bra. Scroll down for video . Strip: Lady Kelly Hadfield-Hyde at Manchester Airport. The Mail has preserved her modesty in this grab of CCTV footage of the incident which took place in Terminal One of the airport around 6am on December 3 . 'Doing what I'm told': The Lady of Alderley told the court she was only following the orders of the security guard . Yesterday Lady Kelly Hadfield-Hyde, 50, appeared in court charged with causing a disturbance at Manchester Airport. But the outraged Lady of Alderley told the court she was only following the orders of the security guard. Outside court: Lady Kelly Hadfield-Hyde (right) and Ann Chadwick (left), 48, had been due to catch a flight to Malaga . Magistrates in Trafford saw CCTV footage of the incident which took place in Terminal One of the airport around 6am on December 3. Hadfield-Hyde and Ann Chadwick, 48, had been due to catch a flight to Malaga along with a friend who was travelling with a young child. In the footage of them going through security, Hadfield-Hyde and Chadwick appeared to exchange conversation with airport security staff as they took off their coats and belts and placed them on trays. A minute or so passes before both suddenly begin taking off their clothes, stripping down to their bras before Hadfield-Hyde removes hers. Hadfield-Hyde told the court that security guard Abdullah Mayet had indicated that she should take off all her clothes before passing through the scanner. She said: ‘He was pointing at me saying, “Off”. I said to him, “Do you mean just my jacket?”, but he was saying, “Off, off, all off”.’ The court heard that when more airport security staff arrived in an attempt to defuse the situation both women became abusive and swore at them. Other staff were called to the scene and after a few minutes the women were finally persuaded to put their clothes back on. Clothes off: Magistrates found mother-of-two Hadfield-Hyde guilty of causing a disturbance and she was handed a £55 fine, ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge and £850 costs . Claim: Hadfield-Hyde said security guard Abdullah Mayet had indicated that she should take off all her clothes before passing through the scanner . Both women were later arrested and charged with the public order offence of causing a disturbance. Hadfield-Hyde denied she was drunk. She accused Mr Mayet, who has worked at the airport for five years, of having a poor command of English. But Mr Mayet said his instructions had been clear and he had never asked the women to strip completely. Radha Vaithianathar, prosecuting, told Hadfield-Hyde: ‘I do not know what possessed you to take your clothes off but it wasn’t Mr Mayet.’ She claimed Chadwick, from Lytham, Lancashire, had ‘paraded’ herself in front of another passenger. She pointed out that both had been offered the chance to resolve the matter with a fixed-penalty notice but had insisted on taking it to court. Mother-of-one Chadwick had initially denied the charge at an earlier hearing but changed her plea to guilty while admitting her actions. She was given a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay £500 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Magistrates found mother-of-two Hadfield-Hyde guilty and she was handed a £55 fine, ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge and £850 costs. Speaking afterwards, Hadfield-Hyde said: ‘Okay. I took my top off and it was a bit over the top. But I did nothing wrong I just did what I was told.’ Defence: Hadfield-Hyde said she 'did nothing wrong' Born Nicola Kelly, Lady Kelly Hadfield-Hyde is former partner of Lord James Hadfield-Hyde, an entrepreneur and portrait painter. He bought the title more than 20 years ago and the couple lived together in the 18th-century manor house at Willaston, near Nantwich, in Cheshire. As the salacious ‘Lord Lust’ he appeared on late-night adult TV in the 1990s with a bevy of unclothed models and actresses. Although unmarried, she changed her name and assumed the manorial title. They were involved in a public falling out in 1991 after Lady Hadfield-Hyde accused him of failing to pay more than £50 a week towards the upbringing of their son. Lord Hadfield-Hyde angered locals in 2011 by claiming a Royal Charter meant only he, not the council, could grant permission for the local farmers’ market.","Lady Kelly Hadfield-Hyde, 50, found guilty of causing a disturbance .

Toddler diarrhoea (TD) is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in children aged between one and five . When her two-year-old son, Tom, developed diarrhoea, Emma Maynard assumed it was a stomach bug. Tom seemed perfectly well and ate normally, but the problem didn't improve. So four weeks later she took him to the GP and received a diagnosis she'd never heard of - toddler diarrhoea (TD). This is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in children aged between one and five, but unlike the type caused by a stomach bug, which tends to last for a few days, it lasts for months or even years. 'The GP was confident Tom had it, but we were sent for tests to be sure there was no other cause, such as an allergy,' says Emma, 36, a web designer from North London. 'But the results all came back clear and we were told that he would eventually grow out of TD.'The condition usually starts around the age of one and resolves itself around the age of four, never to be seen again. The cause is unknown. 'It's extremely common,' says Dr Michael Thomson, a consultant paediatric gastroenterologist at Sheffield Children's Hospital and London's Portland Hospital. 'I see children with it almost every week. 'After taking a thorough clinical history, it is usually obvious when TD is the cause because, despite having several episodes of diarrhoea a day, the child is otherwise completely well and growing normally. 'That's the defining symptom. Most nutrients are absorbed in the top 10 per cent of the gut, so they still get enough. Many parents come along concerned that it's caused by an allergy or intolerance. Occasionally, I see parents who have tried eliminating numerous food groups unsupervised, which is not advisable because it can make a child ill. 'If there is a history of being atopic (having allergies) in the family or the child has recently had a bout of gastroenteritis, we'd rule out things such as dairy  allergy or intolerance with a two- to four-week elimination diet, followed by reintroducing these foods. 'If it's a food allergy, though, there tends to be blood and mucus in the stools, and this is not present in toddler diarrhoea.' Another possible cause is coeliac disease - where the body reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat. 'If this is suspected, we can do a blood test for that,' Dr Thomson says. While there is no drug treatment for toddler diarrhoea, dietary changes can help. 'The first change is to cut out fruit juices, especially clear apple juice,' says Judy More, a paediatric dietitian. This is hugely popular with children, but, in fact, it's one of the main culprits in toddler diarrhoea. The problem is the fructose it contains, which  is poorly absorbed by some children. Cutting down on fructose and increasing fat in your toddler's diet could help alleviate symptoms . 'If a sugar is not absorbed properly in the upper gut, it goes through to the large bowel unchanged,' says Dr Thomson. 'The bacteria there then digest it and it ferments, causing gas and diarrhoea. For unknown reasons, some toddlers have a lower threshold of tolerating fructose than others.' A second and often effective change is to increase the level of fats in your child's diet. 'This may seem at odds with advice on combating obesity, but fats can slow gut transit time and ease diarrhoea,' says Ms More. 'Of course, we're not talking about extra biscuits and doughnuts, but foods such as full-fat yoghurt, whole milk, cheese and a little more cream, butter and oil.' Also it can help to reduce the amount of fibre in the diet, as it may be making gut transit time faster. 'Don't cut it out altogether, but limit it, and keep an eye out for fibrous foods that make the diarrhoea worse,' says Ms More. 'This can differ according to the child. For example, grapes and dried fruit might be fine for one child, but bother another.' All of these dietary changes can have an impact, but not always. Children do eventually grow out of toddler diarrhoea, 'which is probably due to the gut  maturing with age', says Dr Thomson. He says children with toddler diarrhoea should never be given anti-diarrhoea medicines such as loperamide - which is found in many over-the-counter remedies. On the whole, children are not distressed by the condition, as it doesn't usually cause any pain.  'It's more often the parents who are suffering because of its social impact and the increased laundry,' says Ms More. 'Having constantly to change clothes and deal with diarrhoea accidents can be very stressful.'Emma Maynard also found that sending her child to nursery was a battle. 'The nursery's handbook says that a child has to stay away for 24 hours after a bout of diarrhoea, so they kept ringing me at work to come and collect him every time he had an accident. 'I tried to explain that he didn't have anything infectious, but it took a letter from the GP for them finally to understand. 'It's not pleasant for them to have to change him when he can't make it to the loo in time, but there's nothing we can do until he grows out of it.' Alison Gordon's children, Jonah, four, and Ben, 22 months, have the condition. 'Our GP referred us to an allergy specialist when Jonah started having chronic diarrhoea at ten months,' says the 31- year-old financial adviser from East Sussex. 'There is a history of allergy in our family, so we tried cutting out foods such as dairy, but it didn't make any difference. 'We weren't given any other advice apart from that, so we've just soldiered on.' But like all children with toddler diarrhoea, the boys are strapping and healthy. 'They're huge and growing well and they don't know any different so they're quite happy!' says Alison. 'It's not so bad now that Jonah is toilet-trained. I think he is starting to grow out of it.' Dr Thomson adds: The most important thing to remember is that if you think your child has toddler diarrhoea, don't be tempted to cut foods out of their diet without specialist help. 'Food groups such as dairy are  vital for a child's growth and health. 'If the suggested dietary changes - cutting out fruit juice and  increasing fats -don't make a difference, I'm afraid it's a case of sit tight and wait for them to grow out of the condition.'","Emma Maynard assumed her two-year-old son had a stomach bug .

Coastal areas are set to suffer the . worst weather today, with stormy waves smashing into sea walls in the . North East and 50mph winds making the temperature feel around eight . degrees . colder than it is. Scotland and Ireland experienced the highest seas anywhere in the world this week, according to swell models used by wave chasers. The super-sized waves were taller than a four-storey house. A buoy called K5, which monitors the sea's movement off the Western Isles in the North Atlantic, recorded wave heights of 14.3m (46.9ft) on Monday. The data is used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Met Office, with surfers' website Magicseaweed.com in Kingsbridge, South Devon, using it to create swell models. These forecast wave sizes out to sea and their size close to shore. Magicseaweed forecaster Ben Freeston said: 'It's been an active winter in the Northern Atlantic with several large storms already. 'Typically a swell in this sort of size range occurs about once per winter approaching Scotland, which is uniquely placed globally for such an event.' Magicseaweed draws on other meteorological information being shared across the world by trained observers and sent from automated weather stations and satellites. Swell: Deeper colours show wind gaining speed around Scotland, causing huge waves at the shore . The forecaster said that as storms pass to the north of Greenland the large, prominent land mass acts almost like an aircraft wing, creating an area of higher speed winds flowing to the east around the tip. This wind pattern builds energy into swells and points itself directly at Scotland. Mr Freeston added: 'The same storms that create these colossal swells tend to march over the land as the waves arrive, so a typical swell is accompanied by extremely strong winds. 'It's probably accurate to say that Scotland has some of the largest waves on Earth.' Dave Wheeler, a photographer and forecaster on Fair Isle, in Shetland, was monitoring Monday's swell charts. He said the high seas were among the worst in living memory on the remote island. Waves, presented as bright colours on the charts, caused damage on Fair Isle, with the sea smashing a wall at the 120-year-old South Lighthouse and washing the debris several hundred metres inland.

The muslin swaddling cloth that his proud parents bought Prince George for his first public appearance sold out in less than four hours. And it seems the youngest royal, who was tightly wrapped in the cloth when he left the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, has sparked a renewed interest in the age-old tradition of swaddling itself. Trendsetter: George seemed to be tightly wrapped in his first official photo . It is not known if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have actually decided to swaddle their baby, or if they simply used the Aden + Anais cloth as a wrap. Supporters believe swaddling a baby by wrapping the body, arms and legs in a thin cloth can help to calm a child and help it sleep. Divided opinion: Some healthcare professionals advise against swaddling, while others recommend it . But medical studies have suggested a link between swaddling and an increased risk of cot death, hip development problems and posture issues. Now mothers who were inspired to swaddle their babies after seeing Prince George in his wrap say that they have been faced with conflicting advice. Grandmother Valerie Bachelor, from Okehampton, Devon, said her daughter was told swaddling could put her baby’s life at risk. ‘My daughter swaddles her baby (also George, born a week before the royal baby) as he seems to sleep better this way,’ she said. ‘Last week, on a visit to her local clinic, she was sternly told off for doing so as it is against guidelines. ‘My daughter now has a note on her file saying that she is swaddling her baby against professional advice and is willing to put her baby’s life at risk by doing so.’ She added: ‘What should she do – follow the advice of health professionals or the example of royalty?’ Mothers on parenting websites also said they had been told not to swaddle by health visitors and nurses – who warned them that their babies’ development would suffer if they were wrapped up. Some said they had been told that official guidance now said babies should not be swaddled. But a Department of Health spokesman confirmed that there have been no national guidelines issued about swaddling. One exasperated mother wrote: ‘This is so confusing. Do we or don’t we? The changing guidelines make me quite anxious sometimes.’ Rosemary Dodds, from the National Childbirth Trust, said: ‘It is not straightforward, there is evidence for and against swaddling. ‘Some health professionals prefer to give clear instructions and tell parents not to swaddle because that seems like the simplest option in the light of the evidence.’ A baby's nursery is now the most expensive bedroom in the house to decorate and furnish – costing £3,825, according to a survey. The study found that the average cost of preparing a room for a newborn has more than doubled in only a generation. Parents now insist on buying their baby matching furniture and accessories, worth £1,473. Clothes and electrical equipment, such as baby monitors and even TVs, also add to the cost. The poll, by retailer Littlewoods.com, found that only the kitchen and the living room cost more to furnish – at £5,919 and £5,418 respectively. New mother Lucy Brown, from Brighton, said: ‘Shopping for baby goods and clothes is addictive. It’s easy to get carried away in all the excitement of the birth.’","Pictures of baby George sparked renewed interest in age-old tradition .

Former Oakland Raiders line-breaker Rolando McClain - who retired from the NFL in May aged just 23 following a string of controversies - has explained how he was headed down a path of anger-filled self-destruction and felt like he 'just wanted to kill someone'. Stepping away from the game less than a month after singing with the Baltimore Ravens, McClain - who in 2010 was given a rookie contract worth $40 million over five years - said he feared he was on-track to be the next Aaron Hernandez, who he watched get hauled away in handcuffs and charged with first degree murder. McClain's comments, which are revealed in a new interview with ESPN magazine, come after he was arrested three times in 16 months during visits home to Decatur, Alabama. McClain said he started developing a disdain for pro football due to constant requests for money from family and friends in Decatur, leading him to fork out over $600,000 over a six month period to take care of those close to him. Angry: Controversial NFL star Rolando McClaine, who walked away from the game this year, has said he 'doesn't know if I'm ready yet' to understand where his anger came from but that he is taking the necessary steps to get his life back on track . Defence: Rolando McClain takes down Leonard Pope of the Kansas City Chiefs while still playing for the Oakland Raiders. McClain said he will 'probably' return to the NFL next season . On the day of his most serious arrest - for discharging a firearm beside a man's head during an altercation - McClain was in town for his grandfather's funeral. Upon arrival he found out his family had planned a $20,000 funeral, including limousine transfers, that he was to pay for. 'I was pissed off,' McClain told ESPN. 'I was feeling like Aaron Hernandez or something ... like I just wanted to kill somebody.' '(I) would have ended up locked in a cage like an animal. That had to be the only outcome.' McClain has spent the last few months in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, which is his college town. He is taking classes at the University of Alabama to work towards a degree in family financial plan. Happier times: Rolando McClain has returned to his college town of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where he is taking classes and continuing to train . Revealing that he gave out about $600,000 to family and friends who were constantly asking for money, Rolando McClain is now attending classes at the University of Alabama (pictured) and is working towards finishing his degree in family financial planning . It's a far cry from where he was five months ago. McClain was arrested for disorderly conduct in April at a park in Decatur, where an estimated 700 people had gathered for the night, just 10 days after signing with Baltimore. 'The officers started moving everyone out of the street, when they heard someone from the crowd start yelling ''F the police'',' Decatur Police Lt. John Crouch said at the time. 'They continued to move people out of the streets when they heard it again. They eventually identified the person in the crowd. 'They moved in, told him he was under arrest for disorderly conduct, at which at that point, he tried to jerk away.' They later identified the man as McClain. In January he was arrested after he reportedly signing an expletive instead of his name on fine to the for a window-tint violation on his vehicle. Aaron Hernandez, a former tight end for the New England Patriots, was indicted by a grand jury in August for the murder of Odin Lloyd, a friend and semi-professional player for the Boston Bandits. Lloyd's body was found about a mile from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, with multiple gunshot wounds to the back and chest . Aaron Hernandez is being held at Bristol County Jail without bail, having been charged with the first-degree murder of Odin Lloyd. If convicted he faces life in prison without the possibility of parole . Despite his trouble-plagued year, McClain said he would 'probably' return to the NFL next season. He is continuing to keep in shape while in Tuscaloosa. If he does return to the game, the Ravens will retain his rights. McClain appeared in 41 games over three seasons for the Raiders and recorded 246 tackles over that span.

A nun has been convicted of sending six envelopes containing white powder to parliamentary figures including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Sister Ruth Augustus, 71, of Leyton, east London, denied six counts of hoaxes involving noxious substances or things. She accepted that she sent . envelopes with letters in them but claimed police put the white powder . in them, the court was told. One was addressed to Mr Clegg and on the . envelope was written 'devil worshipping', 'freemason', 'sex with 30 . plus women' and 'your poor Catholic wife and children'. The letters were intercepted, three at a time on two separate occasions, at a mail screening centre. The powder was found to be non-hazardous, Harrow Crown Court in west London was told. Mr Justice Saunders deferred the case until September for a hearing at the Old Bailey while a medical report is prepared on Augustus’s mental health. She was released on bail on condition that she 'does not contact, directly or indirectly, any MP or senior Government official' unless through her solicitor, the court heard. Mark Kimsey, prosecuting, said three envelopes were intercepted at a mail screening centre in east London on June 17 last year. A worker was checking mail when three envelopes raised concerns. The second letter was to Baroness Scotland, and had a swastika on it and two crosses, and 'stop this evil devil worshipping'. The third letter was to Baroness Kennedy, and was endorsed with a swastika, and 'stop these evil devil worshipping freemasons'. Both Baroness Scotland, left and Deputy Prime Minster Nick Clegg were sent envelopes containing white powder. Addressed to Mr Clegg, the envelope had 'devil worshipping' written on the outside . The envelopes contained a gritty substance, but it was found they had already tested negative for anthrax, and specialist police who were called in found them to be non-hazardous. On October 1, at the same place, three more envelopes were found, addressed to Mr Clegg, Lady Kennedy and MP Edward Leigh. Scare: The envelopes contained a gritty substance, but it was found they had already tested negative for anthrax (file photo) The envelopes carried similar endorsements and slogans and contained white powder which was found to be non-hazardous. On December 7, Augustus was arrested at a hotel where she was staying in north west London and told police 'It’s a load of lies', Mr Kimsey said. The trial heard that Augustus told police during interview: 'I’m Sister Ruth, a 71-year-old disabled nun.' She also said: 'I look like a terrorist, don’t I, working for a charity all over the world, with orphans?' The jury heard that she told interviewing officer Detective Constable Anne Adams: 'The police are run by freemasons. All the top women are in it.' Asked why she had sent a letter to Mr Leigh, she said: 'He’s a Catholic, and goes to Westminster Cathedral.' As for Mr Clegg, she said he 'lied about all the tuition fees and everything else, keeping those Tory millionaires and rats in government'. She added: 'He boasted about all the women he’s had sex with. He’s an atheist singing hymns in the Albert Hall.' At one point she said: 'I’m not a Muslim terrorist, I’m a Catholic nun.' And she said of the police: 'They opened the envelopes, and put white powder in, to frame me. I know they monitor it all. 'I’m a Catholic nun, with more brains and intelligence than the police.' Asked if she was sending the letters for attention, she said: 'Of course I am. I’m deliberately writing on the envelope as well so all the postmen will know all about it.' Following her conviction, Augustus turned to the public gallery as she left the courtroom and said she would be appealing against the verdict. A jury took less than two-and-a-half . hours to find her guilty by a majority verdict of 11 to one on all . counts following a three-day trial.","The letters were intercepted at a mail screening centre and the powder was found to be non-hazardous .

Sea levels are rising far faster than the latest estimates given by international climate change researchers, a new study has warned. Rising tides have the potential to threaten the homes of billions of people living in coastal areas across the world and could spell disaster for low-lying megacities like Tokyo and London. The new findings suggest that the oceans are rising around 60 per cent more quickly than the latest best estimates from the International Panel on Climate Change. Heading for disaster? This computer generated . picture simulates how London would look in the event of catastrophic . flood. A new study warns sea levels are rising faster than was . previously thought . However the research found that the panel, which is derided by some as alarmist, was generally correct in its estimates of rising temperatures. Stefan Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said that while global temperatures were rising within expectations, the 'more complex' problem of sea-level rises had outstripped predictions. Dr Rahmstoft and colleagues from the Laboratoire d'Etudes en Géophysique et Océanographie Spatiales (LEGOS) in France and the U.S. based Tempo Analytics compared climate projections to actual observations from 1990 up to 2011. Five global land and ocean temperature series were averaged and compared to IPCC projections. Inexorable rise: Sea level measured by satellite altimeter are shown in red. Data from tide gauges are shown orange. Scenarios as predicted by the IPCC are shown in blue and green . To allow for a more accurate . comparison with projections, the scientists accounted for short-term . temperature variations due to El Niño events, solar variability and . volcanic eruptions. The . results confirmed that global warming continues unabated at a rate of . 0.16 °C per decade and follows IPCC projections closely. Data of sea-level rise, however, provided a different picture. The oceans are rising 60 per cent faster than the IPCC's latest best estimates, according to the new research. Time is running out in the race to cut greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to keep global temperatures rises below 2C this century, the United Nations warns. Greenhouse gases are being pumped into the atmosphere in such quantities that temperatures are likely to rise at least 3C and up to 5C by 2100 even if government pledges for are kept. Governments must promise and put into action many more measures than they have already committed to if the world is to keep temperatures rises below 2C, scientists and UN officials said. To do so, an international team of scientists said, annual greenhouse gas emissions must be slashed from about 50 gigatonnes (Gt) today to about 44GT by 2020. The researchers compared those estimates to satellite data of observed sea-level rise and found that while the IPCC projected sea-level rise to be at a rate of 2mm per year, satellite data recorded a rate of 3.2 mm per year. 'Satellites have a much better coverage of the globe than tide gauges and are able to measure much more accurately by using radar waves and their reflection from the sea surface,' explained Anny Cazenave from LEGOS. The increased rate of sea-level rise is unlikely to be caused by a temporary episode of ice discharge from the ice sheets in Greenland or Antarctica or other internal variabilities in the climate system, according to the study, because it correlates very well with the increase in global temperature. 'In contrast to the physics of global warming itself, sea-level rise is much more complex,' Dr Rahmstorf said. 'To improve future projections it is very important to keep track of how well past projections match observational data.' He added: 'The new findings highlight that the IPCC is far from being alarmist and in fact in some cases rather underestimates possible risks.'","New findings suggest oceans rising 60 per cent faster than predicted .

This is the horrifying moment one of two bombs exploded in mosques in Tripoli today, killing at least 42 people and injuring hundreds. Disturbing footage obtained by local news channel LBCI News shows the enormous impact of the explosion which struck the al-Salam mosque just as locals were finishing prayers in the largely Sunni Muslim city. The blast ripped . through a wall of the mosque, showering clouds of dust on people sitting . on prayer mats and sending dozens running out of the building.

Obliteration: The mosque disappears behind a cloud of dust as the bomb rips through the side of the building . Desperate escape: As the smoke starts to clear, worshippers begin running from the building . The apparently coordinated blasts - the biggest and deadliest in Tripoli since the end of Lebanon's own civil war - are likely to intensify the sectarian strife which has spilled over into the country from neighbouring Syria. The explosions in Tripoli, 43 miles from Beirut, came a week after a huge car bomb killed at least 24 people in a part of the capital controlled by the Shi'ite Muslim militant movement Hezbollah. A recent resurgence of sectarian violence in Lebanon has been stoked by the bloodshed in Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad is fighting a largely Sunni-led rebellion. Both Hezbollah and radical Sunni groups in Lebanon have sent fighters over the border to support opposing sides in Syria. WATCH: THE MOMENT THE BOMB HITS AL-SALAM MOSQUE . Impact: Lebanese army soldiers stand next to a blast crater outside one of the mosques following the attack . Deadly: At least 42 people have been killed and hundreds more injured as a result of the bombs . Horrific: Worshippers had just begun Friday prayers when the bomb blasts went off . Medical and security sources said the . death toll from today's blasts in Tripoli had risen to 42 by late . afternoon. Hundreds more were wounded. Earlier, the Lebanese Red Cross . said at least 500 people were hurt. The . first explosion hit the Taqwa mosque, frequented by hardline Sunni . Islamists, and killed at least 14 people there, according to accounts . earlier in the day. Further . deaths were reported from a second blast outside the al-Salam mosque, . which the Interior Ministry said was hit by a car laden with 100 . kilograms of explosives. A . Reuters reporter at the scene said the crater from the blast was about . four metres wide and 2.5 metres deep and the floors of the mosque were . covered in blood. A 50-metre stretch of the road was charred black and . the twisted remains of cars littered the area. 'We . were just bowing down to pray for the second time and the bomb went . off. The air cleared, and I looked around me and saw bodies,' said Samir . Jadool, 39. Bloodshed: A man recites prayers amid the destruction after the car bomb outside the Al-Taqwa mosque . Destruction: Charred cars are all that remain following the deadly attack . Lebanon's Red Cross said more than 500 people were wounded in the two explosions. Television footage showed people running through the streets, some of them carrying bloodied victims. Near the Taqwa mosque blast site, angry men toting AK-47 assault rifles took to the streets and fired in the air while other men threw rocks at Lebanese soldiers nearby. Attack: The violence is believed to be spillover from the ongoing civil war in Syria . Lebanese officials called for calm as tensions rose in Tripoli, a Mediterranean port that has seen some of the worst Syria crossover violence. Sunni gunmen have sporadically clashed with fighters from the city's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam to which the Assad family belongs. Former internal security chief Ashraf Rifi, whose home was damaged by the second blast, warned that Lebanon was facing a gathering storm of violence. 'We are still in the beginning of the storm and we must remain aware and try to protect this nation,' he said, speaking outside his home. 'This storm has become a huge, grave danger.' Witnesses at the scene of the blasts said anger was rising among locals, who were shouting out accusations that Assad's government or Hezbollah were behind the attack. Hezbollah released a statement condemning the Tripoli blasts and expressing solidarity with the victims, saying they were targets of efforts to fan more violence in Lebanon. 'We consider this the completion of an effort to plunge Lebanon into chaos and destruction,' the statement said. Hezbollah's political opponents called on the group to withdraw its forces from Syria in response to Friday's attack. Call for calm: Lebanese leaders condemned the attacks and asked people not to be drawn into sectarian strife . Fears: A former internal security chief described the attacks as 'the beginning of the storm' Setback: The attacks are the deadliest since the end of Lebanon's civil war . Lebanese Defence Minister Fayez Ghosn warned against being dragged into deeper sectarian bloodshed. 'We are calling for calm and vigilance, because the aim of this (blasts) is to stoke strife between sects,' he told LBC. The southern suburb of Beirut dominated by Hezbollah has been hit by two car bombs in just over a month. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah blamed radical Sunni Islamists. Salem al-Rafei, chief cleric of the Taqwa mosque, is a staunch supporter of Syrian Sunni rebels as well as Lebanese Sunni militants who have joined the anti-Assad battle in Syria.

Robert Maxwell, pictured here in 1990, was investigated by the FBI in the 1950s amid claims he was covertly working for the Russians . The FBI feared that media mogul Robert Maxwell was a Soviet spy who tried to use his publishing empire to send intelligence behind the Iron Curtain, newly-released files have revealed. The media mogul's attempts to publish papers from leading US universities in Russian repeatedly raised suspicions among leading academics. Maxwell, who was born in Czechoslovakia, was building up his Pergamon Press publishing empire in the US in the late 1950s and 1960s when he was covertly investigated. But the FBI concluded there was no evidence the businessman was involved in 'any acts of espionage' after carrying out extensive inquiries. They closed the case in April 1957 but still faced further claims from scientists that he was working as a spy. Details of the investigation were revealed in heavily-redacted FBI files which have recently been published online. Researchers have previously claimed the colourful publishing boss, who bought the Daily Mirror newspaper in 1984, was a spy working for the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. In Britain, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office released files a decade ago which revealed they were concerned about Maxwell's company and its links to the Soviet Union in the 1950s. However, they also wound down their investigation after failing to prove the claims. A letter marked 'secret' written to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover in February 1955, revealed an investigation had found no evidence that Maxwell had been working as a spy. The note said an extensive investigation had been carried out in 1954 covering his 'travel, activities, interests and contacts'. Soviet links: Robert Maxwell, right, with Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev in the Kremlin. The media mogul faced repeated questions about whether he was engaged in espionage . But it added: 'A lengthy, extensive investigation regarding the subject's activities in the US and Canada has not revealed any espionage activities on the subject's part'. A subsequent letter sent to an unnamed academic in the Duke University engineering department by the FBI reiterated there was no evidence Maxwell was involved in espionage and the case was shut. However, suspicions about the former British army officer lingered well into the 1960s. Russell Maguire, the chairman of the American Mercury magazine, wrote to the FBI in 1957 requesting information about the 'political preferences' of the members of Pergamon, and their 'financial report'. Probe: An FBI letter to Russell Maguire suggested he may wish to 'discreetly look into the activities of one Ian Robert Maxwell' Soviet links: Newly-published document reveals Maxwell's attempts to get USSR cooperation for his publishing ventures . An internal FBI note added that there was no evidence of espionage activity 'on the part of Robert Maxwell in the United States; however... (redacted).' The FBI wrote back to Maguire saying: 'You may desire to discreetly look into the activities of one Ian Robert Maxwell.' In 1958, Senator Prescott Bush, father and grandfather of the two future US presidents, forwarded a letter from Yale University which raised further questions about Maxwell. It said there were concerns he 'may be engaged in a large scale effort to transmit scientific information to the Russians.' Death: Robert Maxwell's body is flown to Las Palmas airport in 1991 after he 'fell' off his boat and died . Robert Maxwell, centre in the baseball cap, with his crew on board his private yacht which he fell from to his death . And in 1962 an agent raised the question that Maxwell's publications may be subsidised by the Soviets because they were a source of technical and scientific knowledge from around the world. There were also suspicions because Maxwell was allowed to enter the Soviet Union six times a year while most people struggle to get any access. Maxwell, who later became a Labour MP in Britain and lived an extravagant lifestyle, made his millions from the publishing empire he set up after leaving the Army. He died in 1991 after 'falling' off . his private yacht off the Canary Islands after plundering his . publishing group's pension fund.","Academics repeatedly warned the FBI that Maxwell may be working for the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s .

In his stupor he tugged away for up to two minutes at the exterior door before telling BA cabin crew on board the packed Boeing 777 that he had mistaken it for the toilet. The incident alarmed eye-witnesses among the 229 passengers on board flight BA 2158 as the Sri Lankan cricket team flew back high over the Atlantic ocean from St Lucia to London Gatwick after playing against the West Indies in the Tri Nations Tour. Wrong door: A member of the Sri Lankan cricket team tried to open the cabin door on the British Airways flight from St Lucia to Gatwick while the plane was at 35,000ft (stock picture of a Boeing 777) The team had boarded in Grenada for the overnight flight which stopped over in St Lucia before landing at Gatwick just before 8am Monday. Witness Charlene Francis, 26, from Willesden in London was just feet away from the unfolding drama with her one year-old daughter ‘TJ’, her mother Linda and sleeping brother Kevin, when the incident happened in economy class about six hours into an eight hour flight from St Lucia to London’s Gatwick Airport. The recruitment consultant who is on maternity leave said: ‘It was pretty frightening. I’m a nervous flyer anyway but things had been fine until then. I was awake. My daughter had been crying. So I saw everything.’ She said the man wrestling with the door was among a group of cricket players wearing the blue Sri Lankan polo-shirt team uniform with their country’s name in yellow lettering. ‘Suddenly he came over and tried to open the cabin door several times. It went on for a few minutes. He was pulling quite heavily.' The Sri Lanka cricket team was flying to London after playing against the West Indies in the Tri Nations Tour, pictured is Sri Lanka's Lahiru Thirimanne, last Friday . ‘The BA flight attendants came running down the aisle and tried to calm him down. He seemed quite disoriented. At one stage he was leaning against my daughters cot.’ She heard the man tell cabin crew that he had been looking for the toilet - an account confirmed by BA. Mrs Francis said: ‘It was very scary. He looked very dazed or drunk. He was very tall and wearing black and red ‘Dre’ headphones. ‘He had a blue polo shirt and the team logo along with his team-mates. ‘Some of his team-mates were shouting and telling him to stop. I was just a few feet away. My mum was really upset. Thank goodness he was stopped. ‘Somebody said they had been drinking for four hours before they got on the plane.’ BA said: ‘During the flight a man got up and tried to go to the toilet. ‘But instead of going to the toilet he tried to open the aircraft door in mid-flight. ‘The event was linked to ""an element of alcohol"". He explained his mistake and cabin crew accepted it in good faith. Cabin crew reassured customers who witnessed the event.’ The player, who has not been identified, was intoxicated on he flight back from the game, pictured, and thought the cabin door was the bathroom . BA stressed that it is impossible to open the pressurised door in mid-flight and that at no point was the safety of passengers compromised. Security were informed on the ground but police were not called or involved. After leaving the BA flight at Gatwick, the player and his team mates subsequently boarded another plane belonging to another airline taking them on to Sri Lanka. Officials confirmed witness accounts that the man at the centre of the drunken escapade was a Sri Lankan cricketer but declined to name him. A British Airways spokesman said:’ There was a minor incident onboard the BA2158 service from St Lucia to Gatwick involving a customer who we believe had been drinking’ He added: ‘It is impossible to open an aircraft door when it is at high altitude and at no point was the aircraft in any danger. ‘Our cabin crew are highly trained to deal with such incidents and offered re-assurance to customers who were sitting near to the door.’ The West Indies beat Sri Lanka by six wickets.

Tony Blair could be next to face a legal claim for damages from the Libyan man who alleges MI6 sent him to be tortured by Gaddafi’s regime, after he announced he was suing Jack Straw. In a move without precedent against an ex-minister, Abdel Hakim Belhadj served legal papers against the former foreign secretary over claims that he authorised the Secret Intelligence Service to hand him over to Gaddafi’s government. The Mail has learned that Mr Belhadj’s lawyers are now preparing a case against Mr Blair as well. Lawsuit: Tony Blair is facing a legal claim from Abdel Hakim Belhadj . In another dramatic development, coalition ministers have apparently undermined Mr Straw’s claims of ignorance about the affair, revealing that papers showing he was implicated in the rendition of Mr Belhadj do exist. Sapna Malik, a partner at Leigh Day & Co, the firm representing Mr Belhadj, said: ‘It would be surprising to us if something of this magnitude was not done with Mr Blair’s knowledge. ‘Our clients would like us to follow this case up the chain of command. He was at the top of the chain of command. Mr Belhadj certainly wants an apology from Mr Blair. Watch this space.’ Mr Belhadj, 45, was the leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which in 2004 was linked to Al Qaeda – links he fiercely denied. He was picked up that year following a tip-off by MI6 and flown by the CIA, via the British Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia, to Libya where he claims he was tortured for six years. The incident took place just days before Mr Blair signed his notorious ‘Deal in the Desert’ with Colonel Gaddafi. Sued: Mr Belhadj has already launched legal action against former foreign secretary Jack Straw . Documents found in Tripoli following the fall of the dictator show that MI6 counter-terrorism chief Sir Mark Allen boasted to Gaddafi’s spy chief Musa Kusa that ‘the intelligence was British’ which led to Mr Belhadj’s capture. He added that the tip-off was ‘the least we could do for you and for Libya’. Last year Mr Straw appeared to deny any knowledge of the operation. But it emerged at the weekend that after he made those claims, he was approached by MI6 officers who showed him a document he had signed authorising the rendition.Senior figures in the Coalition claim some documents implicating Mr Straw do exist. One source said: ‘There are papers that point the finger at Jack Straw.’ But Downing Street officials yesterday said they have ‘no plans’ to hand over the documents. Lawyers for Mr Belhadj and Sami Al Saadi, who also claims he was returned to Libya and tortured, yesterday served Mr Straw with notice that they will launch formal legal proceedings against him unless he comes clean, apologises and produces key documents. Soldier: Abdel Hakim Belhadj speaks to Libyans at a rally in Tripoli in September 2011 . Mr Belhadj, now a senior official in . the Libyan transitional government, is already suing the Foreign Office . and Sir Mark Allen. They all have four weeks to come clean and publish the papers or the civil case will begin. Miss Malik said: ‘If the former foreign secretary does not now own up to his role in this extraordinary affair, he will need to face the prospect of trying to defend his position in court.’ She added: ‘The real issue here is not about the amount of compensation, it is to get public acknowledgement and an admission from Jack Straw and others involved in his rendition. We have evidence that implicates very senior people.’ But she admitted they could seek damages that would force Mr Straw to sell his house. Mr Straw and Mr Blair are also expected to be questioned by Scotland Yard detectives, who have launched a criminal inquiry into the behaviour of ministers and intelligence officials. Mr Blair has previously claimed he has no recollection of the case. Yesterday Mr Straw refused to comment, saying: ‘I am sorry that I can’t say more about this case, but with a police investigation pending and this intended civil legal action I am sorry that it is not appropriate for me to say any more about it. ‘They are entitled to bring the action and it will be dealt with in due course.’","Abdel Hakim Belhadj is already suing Jack Straw .

Jailed: Emma Hall will spend at least 15 years in prison for the brutal torture and murder of Luke Harwood . A gang who tortured and killed a teenager who was wrongly accused of rape were jailed for life yesterday. The trio – led by baby-faced Emma Hall – left Luke Harwood, 18, looking like ‘the Elephant Man’ after punching and kicking him for two hours. The mob then took him to wasteland and jumped on his head until he was dead. James Danby, 27, who was covered in blood, turned to Hall, 21, and said: ‘I’ve finished him.’ The next day, they returned to cut off Mr Harwood’s fingers and pull out his teeth to prevent his body being identified. But Hall had tipped off the police and they were arrested. Mr Harwood was killed after an 18-year-old girl pointed him out to Hall during a chance meeting and claimed he had raped her two years earlier. She had made a complaint to police but withdrew it after they found that no rape had taken place. Danby, Hall and her boyfriend Tony O’Toole, 30, denied murder but were convicted by a jury at the Old Bailey. Sentencing them, Judge Paul Worsley said: ‘Luke Harwood was only 18 when he was brutally murdered. He had a pregnant girlfriend and a young child. He was subjected to beating, punching and kicking for a period of some two hours, which left footmarks on his skull and head such that he had the appearance of the Elephant Man. ‘He was a vulnerable victim. He weighed only seven stone, was 18 and no match for any of you, let alone a joint group attack. He was completely at your mercy – he had been rendered completely helpless.’ Victim: Mr Harwood, 18, (pictured left and right) had been wrongly accused of raping a teenager who pointed him out at a party . Jailing Danby for a minimum of 25 . years, the judge called him ‘a controlling, manipulative and dangerous . individual’ who ‘has shown no sign of remorse’. O’Toole was jailed for a minimum of 17 years and Hall was given a minimum term of 15 years. The court heard that when Hall was told of the rape claim, she said: ‘I’m going to ****ing kill him.’ The trio set upon Mr Harwood at his . home in Romford, Essex, punching and kicking him in the face and head, . spraying blood over the walls. Hall then drove Danby, O’Toole and Mr . Harwood to a lane where he was taken to the bank of a stream in . Woodford Green, East London, and killed in May last year. His body was . hidden under an old mattress. The killers, all from Romford, then . bought petrol and set fire to their bloody clothing, before cleaning up . the bloodstains at the house. Killers: Tony O'Toole, left, and James Dandy, right, were also given life sentences for the teenager's murder . The next evening, Hall drove Danby, . O’Toole and Billy Duggan, 21, to the spot. Prosecutor Simon Denison, QC, . said: ‘They had with them knives and a pair of bolt cutters that they . were intending to use to mutilate his body to make it more difficult for . him to be identified.’ But Hall had told the police to divert guilt . from herself, and officers were waiting. Hall and Danby were also found guilty . of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and perverting justice. O’Toole was also found guilty of perverting justice and conspiracy to . pervert justice, along with Danby. Duggan was found guilty of perverting . justice and conspiracy to pervert justice and was given a two-year . sentence suspended for two years. After the case, Mr Harwood’s family . said: ‘He should still be alive to share his life with us and to be a . father to his son, as well as his daughter whom he never met. ‘He was falsely accused of a crime he . didn’t commit and killed in the most violent way. His murderers took . away his life for no reason, leaving his family with no chance to say . goodbye.’","Emma Hall encouraged gang to beat Luke Harwood to death in Essex .

President Obama may be earning the favor of his Irish ancestors by attending the G8 conference with his family but it is stirring the ire of American taxpayers outraged by the cost of the trip. The two-day trip around the Republic is expected to cost U.S. taxpayers more than $5.2million. The President, his wife and daughters touched down in Belfast amid the biggest security operation ever mounted in Northern Ireland. While Obama holds talks with other world leaders at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, Michelle and their girls headed to the Republic. Under watchful eyes: The police presence throughout Ireland, including in front of Dublin's Gaiety Theatre while the First Lady and her two daughters are inside (pictured), is at it's highest levels for the G8 summit . Glamor: Michelle Obama and her daughters are believed to be staying in a $3,300-a-night suite at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin's city center . Mrs Obama and her daughters are staying at the Shelbourne Hotel and according to the Irish Independent, her entourage has booked out  30 rooms in the five-star accommodation. The Shelbourne Hotel is one of . Dublin's oldest and sits in the center of the city overlooking the . public park St Stephen's Green. It is understood that Michelle will stay in the luxurious $3,300-a-night Princess Grace suite. A team of staff were out cleaning the front of the building in preparation for the First family's arrival as the usual swarm of FBI agents hovered around. Moving on: While Barack Obama holds talks with other world leaders at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, Mrs Obama and their children are due to visit the Republic . Though the White House does not release the specifics on how much the trip actaully cost, the $5.2million estimate comes based on the reported cost of the first couple's one-day trip to IReland in 2011 which tallied a $2.6million bill. This two-day trip is likely to cost double that amount taking into account that his daughters now need a security detail and the family have split up into two locations. For this trip, Air Force One arrived at Aldergrove International Airport, 20 miles north of the city, where the President emerged from the plane with his family. On Monday evening, the First Lady made a short speech before watching a special performance of Riverdance at the Gaiety Theatre, a short distance from her city center hotel. Thrilled, girls?

A two-year-old British boy has been 'wrongfully retained' in Egypt for nearly a year by his father after getting 'caught up' in a parental dispute, a High Court judge said today. Mr Justice Roderic Wood said Omar Antar has not seen his British mother - Aisha Qureshi, 35, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire - since late December. The judge gave permission for the 'sad case' to be reported at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London - after an application by Ms Qureshi’s lawyers. Omar Antar, two, (left) has been 'wrongfully retained' by his father, Abdelaziz Antar (right), for ten months . He said he hoped that publicity would pressurise Omar’s father - an Egyptian businessman Abdelaziz Antar, 39 - into obeying a High Court order to return the boy to the care of his 'beleaguered mother'. Mr Justice Wood was told by lawyers representing Ms Qureshi that Omar had been living with his mother in England and Mr Antar had been living in Egypt. Ms Qureshi and Omar had travelled to Egypt for a wedding in November 2012 - but Mr Antar had refused to let the little boy return. Mr Justice Roderic Wood said the High Court had ordered Mr Antar to return Omar to England and to his mother’s care. An Egyptian court had also ordered Mr Antar to return the youngster to his mother. 'In yet another sad case a child is caught up in a dispute between his parents who are living in different countries,' said Mr Justice Roderic Wood. '(Ms Qureshi) needs to obtain (Omar’s) return to this country, where he was born, and where he lived until his father wrongfully retained him in Egypt in December last year at the end of a visit by the mother and Omar for a family wedding. 'That retention was against the mother’s will. As I understand, she has not seen Omar since.' The judge gave permission for the 'sad case' to be reported at a hearing in the Family Division . The judge added: “It is considered by the mother’s legal team that giving publicity to this case will motivate (Mr Antar’s) family and friends to put pressure on him to return Omar. I hope for the boy’s sake that they are right.' The judge said Mr Antar had to obey orders made by English and Egyptian courts. 'The court will readily consider the father’s proposals for the future care of Omar once the boy is back here.' Clare Renton, for Ms Qureshi, said police in Egypt had recently visited Mr Antar’s home but had not been able to persuade him to co-operate. Lawyers for Ms Qureshi explained the background in a written 'case summary' released to the press. They said Ms Qureshi and Mr Antar had met via the internet in 2008. Mr Antar was married with three children and living in Egypt. He wished to 'enter into a second marriage' and had said he was planning to relocate to England. He had said he owned a 'vehicle export/import' business and frequently travelled to England. Lawyers said the couple had married in a Muslim wedding ceremony in June 2008 in Dewsbury. They said the marriage was not recognised under English law. Mr Antar had stayed with Ms Qureshi for 'approximately two weeks' and returned to Egypt at the end of June. After that he had visited Ms Qureshi 'approximately every six months'. Omar had been born in July 2011. Mr Antar had been in England for the birth before returning to Egypt at the end of July. Lawyers said Ms Qureshi had visited Mr Antar in 2010 and 2011. 'The mother travelled to Egypt on a third occasion on November 18, 2012 on return tickets,' said the case summary. 'She was due to return to England with the child on December 18. Following to mother’s arrival in Egypt, the father removed the child’s passport from her handbag without her knowledge. 'She was, on December 28, 2012, escorted to Cairo airport and forced to book a return flight to England. The mother arrived home in England on December 30, 2012.' The judge was told Omar had been living with his mother in England and Mr Antar had been living in Egypt . Lawyers said Ms Qureshi had asked Mr Antar to return Omar but he had refused. She had then begun legal action in the High Court in England - and Egypt - and in February Mr Antar had been ordered to return Omar to England. Lawyers said attempts to enforce that order had failed and Ms Qureshi had 'felt that she had no option but to seek the lifting of publicity restrictions' in the hope that media coverage would help bring about Omar’s return. Previous High Court hearings had been held in private and journalists had not been allowed to identify Omar.","Two-year-old Omar Antar has been in Egypt with his father since December .

David Cameron today launched a bold pitch for more investment from Muslim countries, insisting Britain had nothing to fear from foreign money, . The Prime Minister defended overseas investors buying up UK businesses, infrastructure and even football clubs insisting it 'creates wealth, jobs and growth'. He stressed that Britain's 'unique selling points is its openness' as he said the UK hopes to offer a £200 million Islam-friendly bond as early as next year. Launch: David Cameron told the World Islamic Economic Forum in London that Britain will become the first non-Muslim country to issue Islamic bonds, known as sukuk . Line-up Leaders attending the World Islamic Economic Forum, including Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron (10th L), pose for a family photo in London . A ground-breaking new Islamic index on the London Stock Exchange is to be launched to establish the City as one of the world's leading centres of Islamic finance. Addressing the World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF) meeting in London, the Prime Minister said that the UK also intends to become the first country outside the Islamic world to issue its own Islamic bonds, known as sukuk. He said: 'I know some people look at foreign companies investing in our businesses, financing our infrastructure or taking over our football clubs and ask – shouldn’t we do something to stop it? 'Well, let me tell you, the answer is “no.”  One of Britain’s unique selling points is its openness and this openness is a vital part of how we ensure our country is a great success story in the global race. 'Foreign investment creates wealth, jobs and growth. And far from weakening our industrial base, that investment actually strengthens it. Islamic investment is already fundamental to our success.' Defence: Mr Cameron said Britain should be open to foreign investment . The announcements reflect the Government's determination to tap into the fast-growing global market in Islamic investments, which have risen by 150 per cent since 2006. They are expected to be worth £1.3 trillion next year. 'Already London is the biggest centre for Islamic finance outside the Islamic world. And today our ambition is to go further still,' Mr Cameron said. 'Because I don't just want London to be a great capital of Islamic finance in the Western world. 'I want London to stand alongside Dubai as one of the great capitals of Islamic finance anywhere in the world. The announcements reflect the Government's determination to tap into the fast-growing global market in Islamic investments. File picture . A sukuk is an Islamic bond. It generates returns to investors without breaking Islamic law that prohibits interest. The essential difference with a conventional bond is that each sukuk represents a share of ownership of the asset you are investing in. Regular bonds represent a share of debt. Whereas normal bonds do not give the investor a share of ownership in the project they support, sukuk investors get partial ownership. The criteria for what you can invest in with a sukuk is limited. It must be sharia-compliant. Conventional bonds which can be used for anything. Bond holders receive regularly scheduled interest payments for the life of the bond - often at a fixed rate - and they are not affected by costs related to the asset. Sukuk holders receive a share of the profit and accept a share of any loss incurred. 'There are some countries which . naturally look inwards, pull up the drawbridge and refuse to recognise . that the way the world is changing affects their future success. 'But Britain will not make that mistake.' The creation of a new stock exchange index listing Islamic compliant companies is intended to attract more Islamic investors to London. Experts claim the stock will make it easier for them to identify suitable investment opportunities. At the same time the Treasury is working on the issue of a bond-like sukuk, worth around £200 million, which could be launched as early as next year. It will be structured so that investors are paid a fixed return based on the profit generated by an underlying asset. This is in line with Islamic principles which forbid interest-bearing bonds. The WIEF, which is being held for the first time in a non-Islamic country, is expected to bring 15 world leaders to London. More than 1,800 delegates are said to be coming from 115 countries - many of them from the Government's priority high-growth markets. The UK is also giving £4.5 million - matched by a donation from the Shell Foundation - to the Nomou fund to support 600 medium-sized businesses with the aim of creating more than 15,000 jobs in unemployment-hit Jordan and Egypt as well as other countries in the region. The Department for International Development is also more than doubling its contribution to the Arab Women's Enterprise Fund to £10 million from £4 million - matched by the Islamic Development Bank. The Arab world has the lowest rates of female participation in the global labour force and the initiative seeks to help female entrepreneurs from poor communities and rural areas in Jordan, Egypt and Libya. International Development Minister Alan Duncan said: 'Jobs and growth are critical to the stability of the Middle East and North Africa. 'We are pleased to be working with the Shell Foundation to create thousands of jobs that will contribute towards the stable economic environment needed for growth and prosperity in the region. 'Women are the engine of growth and it is not possible for a country to develop without investing in women. 'We are delighted to be working with the Islamic Development Bank to design and implement exciting projects that will strengthen women's economic contribution to the Middle East and North Africa.'","PM announces plans for London to become a centre of Islamic finance .

A family have issued a desperate appeal to find a British great-grandmother who has gone missing in the French Alps. Retired teacher Carol Sheridan, 73, has not been seen since she left the picturesque village of Habere-Poche at 1pm on Sunday after telling friends she was going for a drive and then a hike in the Alps. Police are now desperately hunting for her black Fiat Panda, but say they do not know where to concentrate their search as the grandmother did not tell anyone where she was going. The mother-of-two, who has previously lived in Monte Carlo and is a fluent French speaker, usually contacts family and friends daily via social networking sites, e-mail and telephone, but no-one has heard anything from her for almost a week. Her daughter Fiona Conyers, who lives in New Zealand, has co-ordinated a poster campaign and informed French radio stations, locals from the village and is now reaching out to the mountain community online. She said: 'Our main focus at this point is to find her car. 'The area in which she is thought to be missing is vast. 'We are relying on the public to help us find the car. If we find the car, we find mum, it's that simple.' Mrs Sheridan, a grandmother-of-ten and . great-grandmother-of-four, moved to France from her home in Driffield, . East Yorks, two years ago. She was last seen by her neighbour as she drove off in her car to embark on her walk in the Alps. Mrs Sheridan's grandaughter, Heather Tanton, 25, said: 'This is just so out of character for my nan. She'd never go this long without telling us where she is. 'She'd know we'd be worried and mainly she'd love to be showing off pictures of what she'd been doing, so to not hear from her is really worrying.

She said the family have 'been through all the emotions' but are trying to stay positive. Miss Tanton, who lives with 28-year-old partner Mark Owen, a plumber, and their two daughters Zara, four, and two-year-old Sophie in Brough, East Yorkshire, said: 'She's fit as a fiddle and so resourceful and I'm hoping that's what's keeping her going wherever she is. 'She isn't your normal 73-year-old - she's like Bear Grylls, she can light a fire anywhere and will eat anything.'

Stateside: Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said it was 'unacceptable' that British black actors have to go to the USA to find success . The portrayal of black Britons on . screen suggests they can only be successful in sport, music or . entertainment – and not in business or the law, a senior Labour . frontbencher claimed yesterday. Chuka Umunna, the party’s business . spokesman condemned the ‘lazy stereotypes’ that mean too many strong . black role models are ‘ignored’. Mr Umunna also said it was . ‘unacceptable’ that British black actors could not achieve mainstream . success in the UK without first breaking America. In a speech to mark Black History . Month, Mr Umunna criticised the lack of black role models across the . professions. He said: ‘If young black people can’t see people who look . like them editing our newspapers, sitting on the Supreme Court or . running our great British companies, how can we give them the hope that . if they work hard, they can make it too? ‘You see, shining a light on our role models is crucial because too many of them are ignored.’ And he said one of the reasons for . this was that ‘the broadcast and film media have a tendency to . stereotype black people: to present an image of black British people . that suggests we can succeed in sport, entertainment and music, but not . necessarily in other fields’. Mr Umunna, seen as a rising Labour . star, also raised the issue of many black British actors having  to . leave the UK for the US to get better roles. He said: ‘Too many in the British film . and television industries simply don’t cast black British actors in . certain roles that fall outside those stereotypes. ‘It’s often only after they’ve made it . big in the States that black British actors get more – and more varied – . roles here. 'That is unacceptable and has got to change. As a society, . we cannot allow people to default to lazy stereotypes.’ Breakthrough: Hackney's Idris Elba secured the lead in BBC hit Luther after playing a drugs baron in U.S. drama The Wire . His comments come after National . Theatre performer David Harewood encouraged ‘young Black British actors . to get to America if they have ambition’. He said it was a fact that . aspiring actors would have to follow the lead of Adrian Lester, Idris . Elba and himself by crossing the Atlantic in search of success. Mr Elba, from Hackney in East London, . landed the lead in BBC drama Luther only after establishing himself by . playing a drugs baron in US TV series The Wire.

The National Security Agency's director flatly denied as 'completely false' claims that U.S. intelligence agencies monitored tens of millions of phone calls in France and Spain during a month-long period beginning in late 2012. Gen. Keith Alexander contradicted the news reports that said his NSA had collected data about the calls and stored it as part of a wide-ranging surveillance program, saying that the journalists who wrote them misinterpreted documents stolen by the fugitive leaker Edward Snowden. And a key Democratic senator added that European papers that leveled the allegations 'got it all wrong' with respect to at least two countries – saying that it was those nations' intelligence services that collected the data and shared it with their U.S. counterparts as part of the global war on terror. Scroll down for video . Protests: (Left to right) NSA Deputy Director Chris Inglis, NSA Director General Keith Alexander and DNI James Clapper look on as a protestor disrupts the Capitol Hill hearing . National Security Agency Director Gen. Keith Alexander testified Tuesday that the governments of France and Spain conducted surveillance on their own citizens' phone conversations, and then shared the intelligence data with the U.S. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said foreign newspapers 'got it all wrong,' even as she proposed a top-to-bottom review of U.S. spying programs . Showdown: (L-R) NSA Deputy Director Chris Inglis, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander, DNI James Clapper and Deputy AG James Cole defended U.S. intelligence operations in the face of new allegations from overseas . On Monday newspapers in three countries published computer-screen images, reportedly provided by Snowden, showing what appeared to be data hoovered up by the United States from European citizens' phone calls. But Alexander testified in a House Intelligence Committee hearing that 'those screenshots that show – or lead people to believe – that we, the NSA, or the U.S., collect that information is false.' 'The assertions by reporters in France, Spain and Italy that NSA collected tens of millions of phone calls are completely false,' Alexander said. According to the French newspaper Le Monde and the Spanish daily El Mundo, the NSA had collected the records of at least 70 million phone calls in France and another 60.5 million in Spain between December and January.

'To be perfectly clear, this is not . information that we collected on European citizens. It represents . information that we and our NATO allies have collected in defense of our . countries and in support of military operations.' Reporters, . he added, 'cite as evidence screen shots of the results of a web tool . used for data management purposes, but both they and the person who . stole the classified data did not understand what they were looking at.'

'This was not the United States . collecting on France and Germany. This was France and Germany . collecting.

Feinstein on Monday called for a complete review of all the U.S. intelligence community's spying programs, saying that 'Congress needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing.' In the weekend's other intelligence bombshell, the U.S. stood accused of snooping on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone and spying on Mexican President Felipe Calderon's private emails. But Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the committee that spying on foreign leaders is nothing new. 'That's a hardy perennial,' he said, 'and as long as I've been in the intelligence business, 50 years, leadership intentions, in whatever form that's expressed, is kind of a basic tenet of what we are to collect and analyze.' 'It's one of the first things I learned in intel school in 1963,' he assured the members of Congress, saying that the U.S. routinely spies on foreign leaders to ascertain their intentions, 'no matter what level you're talking about. That can be military leaders as well.' Gen. Alexander said he would rather take his lumps with the public and the press than stop a program that protects Americans from future terror attacks .

Gen.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday afternoon that other U.S. officials had confirmed Alexander's version of events, and that the electronic spying in France and Spain was carried out by those nations' governments.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:51 EST, 24 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:12 EST, 1 November 2013 . A former Indiana state trooper who has maintained his innocence over the killing of his wife and two young children for 13 years was finally been cleared of their murder today. Jurors cleared David Camm over the deaths of 35-year-old Kimberly and their children, Brad, 7, and Jill, 5, who were shot dead in September 2000. As the verdict was read, Mr Camm thanked the jury, who had been selected from a town 100 miles away from where the crimes took place to ensure impartiality. Free man: David Camm leaves court today after 13 years and three trials accusing him of murdering his family . Cleared: David Camm, pictured in August, thanked a jury after they found him not guilty of his family's murder . Mr Camm had discovered his family's bodies after they were shot dead in the garage of their Georgetown home. They were killed about four months after Mr Camm had resigned from the Indiana State Police force to take a job with his uncle. The 49-year-old has said previously that he was playing basketball at a church at the time of the murders, but juries had convicted him twice before. Both convictions were overturned on appeal because of issues with evidence. 'This is vindication,' defense attorney RIchard Kammen said. Mr Camm's father, Donald, was jubilant after the verdict as he spoke outside the courthouse with his daughter, Julie Blankenbaker and defense attorneys. 'I don't have the words. I'm very happy,' he said. The third trial was moved about 100 miles north of the crime scene to the central Indiana community of Lebanon to find an impartial jury. Tragedy: Kimberly Camm, 35 (right), her son, Bradley, age 7 (left), and daughter Jill (center), age 5, were discovered shot dead in the garage of their home in September 2000 . 'The verdict is pretty clear,' Special Prosecutor Stan Levco said. Much of the testimony during the eight-week trial focused on blood spatter evidence and Mr Camm's whereabouts at the time of the slayings. Prosecutor Todd Meyer challenged the father's alibi, saying other basketball players couldn't say definitively that Mr Camm never left the church gymnasium on the night of the killings. Mr Levco said in opening statements that Mr Camm had wanted to end his marriage and stood to benefit from insurance proceeds. Mr Kammen did not call the defendant to the stand, saying he believed significant questions had been raised about evidence presented against Mr Camm, and that there was no need for him to testify. Mr Camm's attorneys have blamed a second man, Charles Boney, for the killings. Boney, whose sweatshirt and DNA was found at the crime scene, is serving a 225-year sentence for murder and conspiracy. He had testified that he visited the Camm home on the day of the shootings and sold Mr Camm the gun that was used. He testified he was outside when the shootings occurred and that Mr Camm also tried to shoot him but the gun misfired. Legal fumbles: Camm (center) has been found guilty twice, but both convictions were later overturned . Charged: Charles Boney (left) was convicted of the murders and sentenced to 225 years in prison after claiming he had gone to David Camm's house to deliver a gun . The murders were one of Indiana’s . longest-running cases, following a tangled legal path riddled . with missing murder weapons, allegations of affairs and child abuse, the . emergence of a second suspect and a prosecutor’s removal over a book . deal. Jury selection for the third trial began in August and the trial was moved to Boone County in . hopes that an impartial jury could be found. For Frank and Janice Renn, Kimberly Camm's parents, the trial was another chance to get closure. 'It’s like that movie Groundhog Day, where he keeps waking up to the same thing every day,’ Mr Renn said. After DNA . linked a violent ex-convict to the scene in the first trial, most believed Mr Camm would be . freed. Instead, prosecutors said he had conspired with the second man . to kill his family, and he was convicted again in 2006. Boney’s palm print was found on Kimberly Camm’s SUV, and a sweatshirt found in the garage had been issued to Boney in prison while he was serving time for armed robbery and criminal confinement. Crime scene: Camm told investigators that he returned from a game of basketball on the night of September 28, 2000, and discovered his family slain in the garage of their Georgetown, Indiana, home . Resting place: The grave site of Kimberly Camm and her two young children, Brad and Jill . Both times, appellate courts ruled . that prosecutors had deliberately inflamed the jury, in the first trial . by calling a dozen women who testified they had extramarital affairs . with Camm, and in the second by suggesting he had molested his daughter . without any evidence to back up those statements. September 28, 2000, was like most . days in the Camm household. After work, Mrs Camm drove her children to sports clubs before setting off for home at about 7pm. Mr Camm had left work just before 7pm and drove to a nearby church, where . he arranged to play a pickup game of basketball with a group of . friends. Costly: It is estimated that the three trials of David Camm will have cost the state $4 million . Grieving parents: Janice, left, and Frank Renn hold a photograph of their daughter Kimberly . Seeking closure: In an undated photo, Janice and Frank Renn, center, are seen in a family portrait from Christmas of 1999 with their daughters Kimberly Camm, left, Debbie Karem, right, and their grandchildren Jill and Bradley Camm . Just before 9.30pm, he placed a frantic call with the ISP Sellersburg, where he had worked for 10 years, reporting that he found his wife and children shot dead in the garage of their home. The prosecution, however, rejected David Camm’s version of events, accusing him of murdering his family in order to pursue affairs with other women. During his first trial, the 11 people who took part in the basketball pickup game on the night of September 28 testified in Mr Camm's defense, telling jurors that he was at the gym at the time of the murders. The three trials have cost Floyd County, . where the murders took place, more than $4 million and have forced . officials to eliminate raises for most county employees and repair . bridges and roads only in emergencies.","David Camm who has insisted he is innocent for 13 years thanks jury .

NBA star Kobe Bryant will receive $24 million today as an advance on this season's salary. While most players get paid biweekly, the injured Los Angeles Lakers guard negotiated his contract to get 80 percent of his $30.5 million salary in one lump sum payment. Something to smile about: Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant today received a check for $24.4 million - 80 per cent of his annual salary . He will get paid the remaining $6 million by May. But Bryant won't take home the whole $24 million - a lot of it will go to Uncle Sam. ESPN reported Bryant could have to pay as much as 55 percent of his salary in taxes, leaving him with $11 million. A tax expert told ESPN Bryant is subject to the top federal tax rate of 39.6 percent, which would mean $9.6 million would be withheld. As a California resident, he'll have to pay an extra 13.3 percent, or $3.2 million, in state taxes. Star power: Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant (second from right) negotiated to receive 80 percent of his $30.5 million salary upfront . Bryant hasn’t played in the first two games of the Lakers’ season as he recovers from an Achilles’ tendon tear. The star was injured in an April 12 win over Golden State and underwent surgery less than 12 hours later. Doctors said he could be out of action for up to nine months. Meanwhile, The Los Angeles Times reported that the Lakers are hurting without Bryant, now 1-1 on the season after a big opening-night win over the Clippers. Given his skill, the Lakers are likely to re-sign their star player when his expensive contract expires on June 30. The Los Angeles Times reported the club could go as high as $32.7 million. Right now though, Kobe is the highest-paid player in the NBA. And his $24.3 million one-day windfall is more than any other player in the league will make all year, including Dirk Nowitzki ($22.7 million), Amar'e Stoudemire ($21.67 million) and Joe Johnson ($21.5 million). Seattle Pi reported Bryant has made $275 million in salary over his career. Although Michael Jordan still holds the record for the largest single-season salary, earning $33.1 million for the 1997-98 season.","NBA star Kobe Bryant received $24 million today as an advance on this year's salary .

Devastated: Clare Walker has been denied IVF on the NHS after years of trying to have children . A woman who dreamed of starting a family was refused IVF on the NHS – because her fiance already has children. Clare Walker, 32, was left devastated after being told that the health service would not fund the fertility treatment. Miss Walker first tried to get pregnant when she was in her early 20s, but doctors told her that she would not be able to conceive naturally due to problems with her fallopian tubes. Two years ago she met her partner Matthew Garwell, and after getting engaged last summer the pair decided to apply for treatment so they could start a family. Mr Garwell, who works as a glazier, has two children – Connor, nine, and eight-year-old Evie from a previous relationship – so the couple can not be classified as childless. And during their first appointment at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, a nurse told them this meant they were not eligible for NHS-funded IVF. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that women aged 23 to 39 with fertility problems should be entitled to three cycles of IVF. However prospective parents can find themselves at the mercy of regional variations, as local NHS clinical commissioning groups have the final say on who should be allowed treatment and how many cycles will be paid for. Miss Walker said: ‘I’m having the right of being a mother snatched away from me and it is devastating. Every woman should have that right. Couple: Ms Walker was denied treatment because fiancé Matthew Garwell, right, already has children . Blocked: Bosses at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, Norfolk made the decision . Guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggest that all women under 40 should have access to free IVF. They should be referred for treatment after two years of trying to get pregnant, according to the guidelines - but if, like Ms Walker, they can only have a baby through IVF, they can start treatment straight away. However, the guidelines are only voluntary, and hospitals are free to impose their own rules.In a bid to save money, many local NHS trusts will only fund IVF for women who do not have children already. While it is possible to undergo private IVF treatment, each course costs around £5,000, making it unaffordable for many would-be mothers. ‘I have people deciding my future that have never met me or know my situation. They are playing God with my life.’ She added: ‘Becoming a mother means everything to me. I feel it is my purpose of being here.’ Miss Walker, from Downham Market, Norfolk, has now launched an appeal against the decision. She said: ‘I know there are no guarantees that it will work but if I can at least try then that would help me. My future is being played out in the hands of doctors and it’s not fair.’ And she explained how the refusal had put pressure on the couple’s relationship, adding: ‘Matt broke down himself when he came home and I’m depressed with the whole thing. ‘Matt thinks it’s his fault because he has kids and is upset that he can’t give me what I want. But he can’t be blamed. ‘It is very much that I am being punished for being with the man that I love.’ Barbara James, associate chief nurse at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, said: ‘We treat each IVF case on an individual basis, but we have to be mindful of the rules surrounding treatment in order to be fair to everyone.’","Clare Walker, 32, has dreamed of being a mother since she was a teenager .

Stretched families are saving money by cooking their own traditional meals, according to new research. A poll of 2,000 Britons found that 83 per cent said that they mostly cooked from scratch. The economic downturn has been a factor in the findings with many households saving money by cooking old-style family favourites for themselves. Baking Britain: A survey found that most meals are cooked totally from scratch in eight out of ten households . This year's horse meat scandal also put families off ready made meals, and most now prefer to use fresh ingredients. A survey found that most meals are cooked totally from scratch in more than eight out of ten households. In the study 11 per cent of people admitted to mostly eating ready meals, while four per cent said that they relied on takeaways. Great British Bake-Off judges Mary Berry (left) and Paul Hollywood (right) who have inspired families to bake . And a lucky two per cent said that they mostly eat their meals at restaurants. The researchers also asked people which home-cooked meal they make most. 1. Bangers & mash - 77% . 2. Spaghetti Bolognese - 76% . 3. Omelette - 75% . 4. Roast dinner - 74% . 5. Shepherd’s pie - 69% . 6. Cake - 61% . 7. Soup - 60% . 8. Chilli & rice - 59% . 9. Chicken curry - 58% . 10. Hot pot - 53% . Top of the list is bangers and mash followed by spaghetti Bolognese and omelettes. The success of Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry and their hit series The Great British Bake Off has also had an effect. Over six in ten of the Britons claimed they could bake a cake - a figure that includes over four in ten men. Wren Living, the company that commissioned the research, said that the findings show a sharp change in attitudes among families. The findings are part of an ongoing study by the company into how UK homeowners use their kitchens as part of everyday life. Earlier this year, a study by the Department of Health’s Change4Life campaign found that just over half of families prepared meals from basic ingredients four times a week or less. But the latest findings show that the popularity of cooking from scratch in Britain’s kitchens has risen dramatically since then. The company's managing director Armando Sanchez said: 'British families take a lot of stick for relying on ready meals but our findings show that some of the criticism is undeserved. 'Whether it’s a direct result of the horse meat scandal or because the likes of Jamie Oliver are showing us how easy it is to eat well and cook from scratch, more and more of us are giving it a go.'","Economic downturn and horse meat scandal has changed the way we eat .

Fracking is unlikely to cause cancer - but more research is needed into its long-term effects, a health watchdog has warned. Public Health England (PHE) has criticised a US study which claimed that residents living within half a mile of a site were slightly more likely to get cancer. Scientists in Colorado used a computer model to predict that there would be an extra ten cases of cancer for those living within half a mile radius of a fracking drilling well. Health watchdog Public Health England has dismissed claims that fracking causes cancer. More than 1,000 protestors set up camp this summer outside an 'exploratory' site in Balcombe, West Sussex (pictured) However the PHE - which is charged with protecting public health - believes the research may well be flawed and its findings simply down to chance. It also dismissed the idea that people living near the sites will develop breathing difficulties and other medical problems, saying they ‘know enough’ to allay fears for now - although they admitted that very little research has been carried out into potential harms of the process. Protest: Feelings have run high over the prospect of fracking in Britain. The process, 'hydraulic fracturing', involves pumping water underground at high pressure to crack shale rock and release gas . Dr John Harrison, director of PHE’s Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, insisted that as long as fracking was carried out properly, the potential risks to public health would be ‘low’. He said: ‘The currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health from exposure to emissions that are associated with shale gas extraction process are low if the operations are properly run and regulated.’ However he conceded that research into the long-term health implications had been ‘limited’ – and said they would need to continue to monitor evidence as it emerged. Professor John Newton, PHE’s chief knowledge officer, said: ‘This is by no means the end of the process. ‘We want to continue to collect the evidence and we want to continue to review the data. ‘We know enough about the process to provide this reassurance now. ‘But we should definitely collect the exposure information. ‘We need to understand what the emissions are in detail, so that is the primary thing. ‘However on the whole, the results are reassuring. We do not expect any adverse health effects.’ The Government believes that extracting shale gas by drilling thousands of feet underground could supply our future energy needs and drive down bills. Environmental campaigners say it can cause small earth tremors as well as water contamination and air pollution – which could have long-term health implications. More than 1,000 protesters staged a sit-in during the summer near Balcombe, West Sussex, when energy firm Cuadrilla began an ‘exploratory’ drilling operation. The company was trying to find out how much gas was stored within the rocks and assess whether it can be easily extracted. Another 40 sites across the UK – including areas in Manchester and Lancashire – have now been lined-up by the Government as places that could be suitable for fracking. The Prime Minister recently urged the public to get behind the controversial technique. But Leila Deen, energy campaigner at Greenpeace, said: ‘This report is a timely reminder of the risks inherent in fracking, and the potential long-term health impacts from industrial activity, traffic and the process of firing cocktails of chemicals into the ground in a densely populated country. ‘The Government has so far responded to these risks by cutting the budget of the environmental  regulator and effectively allowing companies to mark their own homework when it comes to monitoring.’","Scientists in Colorado predicted higher risk for those half a mile from well .

Dozens of high school students in San Diego could face criminal charges after texting sexually explicit photos of teenage girls. Schoolgirls, some as young as 13, had sent naked pictures of themselves to their boyfriends, which were then circulated to students at seven schools. Some of the students who received and sent on the photos could now be charged with possession  and distribution of child pornography. Investigation: Schoolboys at seven San Diego schools could be charged with child pornography after sharing pictures of naked girlfriends . 'The individuals took pictures of . themselves in very compromising positions, exposing various parts of . their bodies, and very, you know, unflattering,' Lieutenant Chuck Haye of the San Diego Police Department said. He told 10 News about 30 students at six high schools and one middle school were involved and that many of the girls had no idea their pictures were being distributed. 'We have several hundred photographs to . look through. We have a much smaller number of pictures that actually . have a face shot that will provide us an opportunity to identify who it . is,' Lieutenant Haye added. The San Dieguito Union High School District told ABC News it was cooperating with the investigation and that it encouraged parents 'to consistently monitor teen-use of cellular phone and other technologies'. Parents in the school district have also said the case has prompted them to think about the way their children use phones. Gordon Cooke, whose 14-year-old daughter attends Canyon Crest Academy, one of the schools allegedly being investigated, said: 'What I tell my kids all the time is you’re really just one screen shot away from ruining your lives.' 'I think a lot of the kids don't realize and they think it's funny and innocent,' he said. San Diego police plan to file criminal charges but have not said when that will happen.

TV cameras filmed a case in one of the highest courts in the country for the first time yesterday in a ‘landmark moment for justice and journalism’. Viewers watched the Prime Minister’s brother Alex Cameron, QC, attempt to reduce the sentence of the ringleader of a coin-forging gang at the Court of Appeal. After the hearing David Cameron appeared to support the wider introduction of cameras in other courts to promote ‘open justice’. Scroll down for video . PM's brother: Barrister Alexander Cameron QC was shown attempting to reduce the sentence of a ringleader of a coin-forging gang when cameras were allowed to film a case in the Court of Appeal for the first time . Yesterday’s case in London was broadcast live on the BBC and Sky News and screened live on the ITV and C4 websites. Barrister Mr Cameron, whose appearance on the first televised case was a coincidence, was unsuccessful in his appeal. Asked how he felt about being the first barrister to appear on TV at the Court of Appeal, he said: ‘It’s surprising.’ His younger brother, the Prime Minister, said: ‘I couldn’t help notice that the barrister in the case was actually my brother which was a surprise to me this morning as I think it was a surprise to him.’ Asked if he wanted to see broadcasting extended to criminal trials, the Prime Minister said: ‘Open justice, open government is a good thing. Let’s see how it goes to see if more [cases] can be brought on camera in front of the people whose justice it is, rather than hidden behind closed doors.’ Five courtrooms of the Court of Appeal in London have discreet fixed cameras in them which can be operated by a court video journalist who has both legal and journalistic qualifications. Landmark: Three judges, Judge Anthony Morris QC, Lord Justice Pitchford and Mr Justice Globe heard the case of Kevin Fisher was applying for leave to appeal against his seven years sentence for counterfeiting offences . Some cases will be broadcast live on rolling channels with a 70-second delay to allow the removal of anything that contravenes broadcasting regulations or standard court reporting restrictions, such as contempt of court laws and court orders. Footage can also be broadcast on news bulletins. But it cannot be used for satire, entertainment or for commercial use. Lawyers’ arguments and judges’ summing up, decisions and – in criminal cases – sentencing remarks may be filmed but victims, witnesses and defendants will not be filmed. James Harding, BBC director of news and current affairs, said: ‘This is a landmark moment for justice and journalism. It is a significant step on the way to helping millions of viewers gain a greater understanding of  how our judicial system works.’ Yesterday’s case centred on Kevin Fisher’s seven-year jail term for his role in what is believed to be the largest-ever plot to make fake pound coins in Britain. Fisher, 55, of Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire, was jailed in May with two other men after police recovered 80,000 fake £1 coins and a large quantity of blank metal discs that would have created coins with a total face value of £1.5million. Alex Cameron had argued that the sentence given to Fisher was higher than sentences imposed in similar cases and there was an unfair disparity between Fisher’s sentence and those given to his co-conspirators. But the judges upheld the original sentence.","Moment hailed as 'landmark moment for justice and journalism'

At first, the footage seems to be a normal shot of the famous graveyard - the burial site of numerous famous figures including Karl Marx. But if you look closely, you can see the creature standing by one of the graves staring right at the camera. Scroll down for video . Unexpected: A wallaby has been filmed hopping around Highgate Cemetery in north London . Spotted! In this wider shot, the animal can be seen staring directly into the camera while it stops by a grave . After a little while, the tame animal hops off to adventure round some of the 53,000 graves in the cemetery. The footage, taken on Monday, then continues to follow the wallaby while it skulks around, hopping between the bushes and around gravestones of the westerly area of the cemetery. The creature goes on quite the tour - and explores a fair amount of the English Heritage registered site. Eventually, it hops off down a gravel road and out of site. Visitor and volunteer coordinator Melanie Winyard said someone first saw the marsupial, which belongs to the same family as the kangeroo, on Sunday. She said: 'It’s quite extraordinary and so . unexpected. 'The West Cemetery is quite secure so it’s a . mystery how he got in there but now he’s in, it’s quite a good place to . be as he won’t be crossing the roads.'

Explore: In the footage, filmed by documentary maker Maurice Melzak, the animal hops among the bushes . Adventure: The marsupial then hops off to have a peak around some of the 53,000 graves at the burial site . Mr Melzak, who is also a zoologist, managed to film the creature for around two minutes. He said: 'I live right next to the cemetery and when I heard there was a wallaby I was straight round. 'I saw some pictures that visitors had taken during the day on Sunday but I didn't see the animal myself. 'I went back the next day and there it was - hopping around. It was extraordinary. 'It is quite odd. Apparently they do live in packs wild across the country, however strange that seems. 'I don't think it is alone either. I later saw a wallaby but it looked different somehow - so perhaps there are two of them. I can't be sure though. 'I heard someone had seen a wallaby in the park too.' Visit: The animal, seen next to the tree in this shot, was first spotted on Sunday by visitors to the English Heritage site who took pictures of the unusual event . Extraordinary: Mr Melzak said the wallaby's visit was odd - and that he thought it may not have been alone . Last week, a man claims to have seen a wallaby in Fitzroy Park, near Hampstead Heath, also in Highgate. Edmund King managed to take a blurry photo of the creature before it ran away. Mr Melzak said he contacted numerous local zoos - and none of them were missing a wallaby. Nearby Golders Hill Park Zoo homes wallabies but a spokesperson said that none of their animals had escaped in recent years. London Zoo in Regent’s Park also confirmed that none of their animals had escaped. Not alone: The sighting follows news that another wallaby was seen on Hampstead Heath last week . I'm off: Eventually, the creature makes its way down a gravel path and out of site . The City of London Corporation, which runs the Heath, said that there had been no official reports of wallaby sightings. A spokesperson said: 'We haven’t spotted any wallabies though there may be a few Australians lurking around. 'We’ve had no unusual sightings in recent times so it seems this is a case like the Loch Ness monster, more imagined than actual reality.'

The Sky City in Changsa in China's Hunan province is one of a number of super-sized skyscrapers nearing completion in cities across China . The pace of change is so fast at present that DesignCurial brought together a list of the world's top buildings, either completed or under construction, that will be changing the look of the world's tallest skyscraper list at a faster rate than ever before. The title holder at present is the Khalifa Burj tower in Dubai at 2,716 feet (828 metres), which towers over the building that was for so long the world's tallest, New York's Empire State, which was 1,250 feet originally, but increased by a new antenna in 1950 to 1,467 feet. The taller of the old twin towers of the World Trade Center was 1727 feet to the top of its antenna, while in London, the Canary Wharf Tower, the old title holder in the UK at 771 feet has just been surpassed by the Shard which is 1,004 feet high. The Shanghai Tower will be the second tallest in the world when completed in 2014 . The Greenland Centre in Wuhan is one of four Chinese super-Skyscrapers planned and under construction . However all these, including the Dubai tower will be dwarfed by the Kingdom Tower currently under construction in another Middle Eastern Country, Saudi Arabia. This building, at the centre of a massive development in Jeddah will be 1,000 metres (3,281 feet) high when completed. The third supertall building in the Middle East is the 'Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel' in Mecca at 1,972 feet, which has the world's largest clock face. Behind the three middle eastern buildings come a whole clutch of buildings underway across the far east, with four supertall skyscrapers going up in China, towers in Korea, and only one real challenger from the 'old west', in the shape of the Twin Towers replacement in New York, the One World Trade Centre at 1,775 feet. Mecca's Royal Clock Tower hotel became third highest building in the world in 2012 at 1,972 feet (601 metres) behind only Dubai's Khalifa Burj and China's Shanghai tower . One World Trade Center was conceived as a defiant riposte to the terrorist attacks that destroyed the twin towers . The Goldin Finance 117 tower (named after the company and the number of floors in the building) will be the tallest building in the Chinese city of Tianjin at 1,959 feet (597 metres) Presently number one in the world, Dubai's Burj Khalifa measures 2,716 feet (828 metres) with 162 floors . Dubai's Burj Khalifa featured in the latest Mission Impossible film, which saw Tom Cruise's character clambering around outside near the top floor . Although taller than the old Twin Towers it still lags behind those developments beginning to carpet Asia on the list. There’s Shanghai's 'Shanghai Tower' at 2,067 feet, soon to be second to Khalifa Burj (but quickly third behind the Kingdom Tower). Changsa, in China's Hunan province has planned 'Sky City' for 2,749 feet to take the present title, although this project has run into trouble and delays. Tianjin city in China, meanwhile, is building the 'Goldin Finance 117' to 1,959 feet, the 'Greenland Centre' in Wuhan, China, is another over 2,000 feet at 2,087 and South Korea is constructing the 'Lotte World Tower' in Seoul to 1,824 feet. With the activity ever more concentrated in the Middle and Far East it means soon the USA, and New York, the home of the skyscraper, will only have the 'One World Trade Centre' in the world's top ten while the UK won't be anywhere near the top 60. The Shard is a mere 1,004 feet high - but that's enough to dominate the London skyline .","The Kingdom Tower in Saudi Arabia will be one kilometre tall - or 3,281 feet .

Snowden fled to Russia in June, hearing arrest and extradition to the US where he faces espionage charges. President Vladimir Putin has rejected American pleas to send Snowden home to face charges including espionage, and the temporary asylum he was granted in early August can be extended annually. Snowden has been spotted only a handful of times in Moscow. The Russians imply there is a risk he could be kidnapped or assassinated by the CIA.

Millions of families could benefit from a crackdown on water bills, as David Cameron tries to seize back the cost of living agenda. Ministers will announce a package of measures to shake up the market next week, to ensure customers get a ‘good deal’. While households have no choice over their water supplier, it is expected to include more discounts or ‘social tariffs’ for pensioners and the low paid. This would also help reduce the soaring burden of bad debts – worth around £1.6billion a year – which firms currently add to the water bills of other households. Bills: David Cameron, pictured on a visit to the M4 outside Cardiff today, has ordered ministers to draw up action on water charges . Unlike energy firms, whose prices are . hiked every year by the Big Six firms, annual water bills, currently an . average of £388 per family, are set in advance by industry regulator . Ofwat. But water firms have been criticised . for using legal loopholes to avoid £1billion of corporation tax, and . paying millions of pounds in bonuses to their executives during last . year’s hosepipe ban. The move comes as Labour leader Ed . Miliband called for the water industry to be ‘scrutinised’ to ensure it . is not ripping off customers. The coalition has been stung by claims it has failed to act on easing the squeeze on family finances, with Mr Miliband taking the lead with his promise to freeze gas and electricity bills for two years if he wins the next election. But today Number 10 insisted Mr Cameron ‘wants to see household costs coming down’ and targeting the water industry will be the next stage. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has already offered water customers in the South West a £50 rebate to tackle historically high bills. However, the new action to be set out by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is likely to offer help to customers across England with the details expected to be agreed this weekend. Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘Clearly the Prime Minister wants to see household costs coming down. ‘There will be some progress next week which Defra will be doing on the water industry and water bills.’ The government had already taken . action to freeze council tax bills, limit rail fare rises and cancel . increases in the cost of MoTs, he added. Water . watchdog Ofwat is preparing to block an eight per cent rise in charges . demanded by Thames Water for next year, which would add an extra £28 to . the average bill. The No.10 . spokesman added: ‘The Prime Minister wants regulators there to look at . the industries they regulate and make sure that they are as robust and . delivering what they need to deliver for customers. ‘The Prime Minister realises that families are hard-pressed. He wants to see prices brought down across the board.’ Options being considered include making social tariffs for the poorest customers compulsory, capping fare rises to an amount linked to inflation and cutting the bad debt caused by customers who refuse to pay which adds £15-a-year to every bill. Costs: The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is to rush out action to limit water bill rises in an attempt to take back control of political debate over the cost of living . Details of the action on water bills are expected to be announced in the middle of next week, with Downing Street denying it had been caught on the hop by Mr Miliband. Chancellor George Osborne signalled the government's plans in a speech last month when he said: 'There are important improvements we can make to the scale of energy and water bills, the cost of housing, the fees paid for everyday financial services, the expense of rail and road travel. 'These are a burden on families – and we are doing everything we can do to reduce their cost – with more to come this autumn.' But Mr Miliband appeared to steal a march on the government yesterday with his warning that the industry could not escape scrutiny at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet. Warning: The government actions comes after Labour leader Ed Miliband said the water industry should be next to face more scrutiny . ‘I think we should be looking at all markets to make sure they are working  properly and that includes the water industry,’ he told the Western Morning News yesterday. ‘Some people will say this is an anti-business agenda. I think it is a pro-business agenda that you have got to reform markets that are not working properly. ‘I think the water industry is something that should be scrutinised to make sure it is working properly and make sure it is working properly for the benefit of consumers, because I know concerns have been raised. ‘I'm proud Labour is championing this agenda and I think it is consistent with believing what a market economy can do, and water is part of that.’ A Defra Spokesperson said: 'The Government is working across the board to reduce the cost of living and help hardworking households who are feeling the pinch. 'We want to ensure customers get a good deal from the water sector and will be setting out our approach next week.' Maria Eagle, Labour's shadow environment secretary said: 'David Cameron has never shown any interest in rising water bills and has wasted three years doing absolutely nothing to address the impact on already over-burdened family budgets. 'More than two million households, over one in ten, now spend more than five per cent of their income on water according to the regulator and customers in Britain face some of the highest bills in Europe. 'Yet David Cameron still refuses to require water companies to introduce a social tariff to help those who are struggling, even though only three companies have introduced such a scheme under the current voluntary arrangement. 'That’s why Labour will use the forthcoming Water Bill legislation to require all water companies to participate in a national affordability scheme and review whether there is a need for a tougher regulatory regime.' It comes after figures this week showed the squeeze on family budgets has lasted for four years and shows no sign of coming to an end, grim new figures revealed today. Disposable incomes have remained almost unchanged since the end of the recession, with the return to economic growth having little impact on ordinary people’s spending power. Instead bills for life’s essentials like housing, energy and petrol have dramatically eaten into incomes, and now account for more than 27 per cent of all spending. The Office for National Statistics warned the economic position of households ‘remains under pressure’. Disposable incomes grew even when Britain was plunged into recession in mid-2008, but have remained ‘broadly flat’ since the summer of 2009, despite the economy growing by 4.2 per cent since then. In particular big rises in energy bills have had a devastating impact on families.","Defra drawing up plans to tackle water charges to be unveiled next week .

A lawyer’s clerk who sent text messages to a prisoner just days before a mobile phone was used to stage his escape from a prison van has been jailed for six months. Sarah McCabe, 33, sent three illicit texts in the space of 13 minutes to convicted robber Ryan MacDonald after the phone was illegally smuggled into Altcourse prison near Liverpool where he was being held. Just three weeks later MacDonald, 20, and a fellow inmate were broken out of a prison van while on their way to court during rush hour in Manchester. Illicit messages: Sarah McCabe, 33, sent text messages to convicted robber Ryan MacDonald in his cell just three weeks before he escaped from a prison van on the way to court . A gang of masked men, believed to be using GPS technology to track the vehicle, blocked the vehicle with a car in the middle of the street and threatened a guard with a sawn-off shotgun before smashing the windows. The two inmates then leapt from the truck and all five jumped back into the Saab, which was dumped further down the street. Three of the gang ran into a nearby council estate whilst the other two sped off on a motorbike. Both escaped inmates were recaptured a few days later. Secret communication: MacDonald, right, asked the lawyer's clerk what sentences he was likely to receive if he robbed a pawn brokers . McCabe of Swinton, Salford, who was acting for MacDonald in his court case, was arrested after a SIM card was recovered from his cell at the privately run jail. Police investigating the breakout later examined the SIM and found three text messages from McCabe on it in which she and her client discussed the possible sentence he might face for robbing pawnbrokers shops. In one message MacDonald texted McCabe saying: 'Bail me?' but she did not reply. He then texted her saying: 'Get us a three. I will take that ha ha x' to which she later responded: 'Oh yeah, that’s gonna happen x.' McDonald texted back saying: 'Is it a five then?' and McCabe who works at David O’Reilly Solicitors in Salford replied: 'I’m not even thinking a five! I’ll have to get Rob to work his magic! X.” McDonald then went on: 'Has Rob got magic in him? Har Har x.” McCabe texted back saying: 'I’d rather not know x.' Escape: MacDonald and another inmate leapt from the truck and jumped jumped into a following car which was dumped further down the street . McCabe, who admitted assisting an offender, remained emotionless as she was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court. Judge Michael Leeming said: 'Sarah McCabe you are an intelligent woman with previous good character. The matter is before me because the person with whom you were in communication escaped from a prison van while on route to this court to be sentenced for serious drugs offences. 'The other man was being tried for very serious offences and that trial had to be stopped because of the publicity surrounding his escape. 'There is no suggestion that you played any part in the planning of the escape but it includes you because it involved the use of an illegally held mobile telephone used from custody. Police operation: Both escaped inmates were recaptured a few days later . 'This was a lack of judgement. The three texts are unrelated in nature to the circumstances of the escape. This was a foolish lack of judgement on your part and totally out of character. When considering the seriousness of your offending I have regard to your culpability and the harm your offending has caused. 'You of all people must have appreciated the peril of your behaviour. You did encourage him to continue to use the SIM by your actions. 'In your position you knew it was an offence for McDonald to be in possession of the phone. You encouraged him and failed to bring the mobile to the attention of the authorities. You put your firm’s interests with this client above the law and kept contact with him to keep him sweet. 'This offence is so serious that only an immediate custody sentence can be justified.' Hidden: The judge said there was no evidence McCabe was involved in planning the escape, but was included because the phone was illegally in custody . The escape occurred on April 30 after MacDonald instructed McCabe’s law firm to represent him after he was charged over raids on pawnbrokers in Manchester and Salford where jewellery was stolen in daylight smash-and-grab raids. McCabe sent her text messages on April 4 after he was remanded in custody to await sentence for conspiracy to rob and aggravated vehicle taking. Elisa Hopley, prosecuting, said: 'A significant amount of planning into that escape was conducted by mobile phones held illegally. A phone used by MacDonald was active between March 8 and April 24. 'The SIM card was recovered from his cell but the handset was not recovered. The handset was the one used in the escape and that has not been found. 'McCabe’s personal telephone number came to the attention of the police. It became clear that she had contact with MacDonald when he was in prison. Her mobile phone was then seized. 'McCabe has admitted the offence and . contact with MacDonald in interviews and admitted it was her personal . phone and she used it for personal and work reasons. 'She . was under no illusions that she was in contact with a phone that was . held illegally. They talked about a potential sentence for MacDonald. 'McCabe did nothing to alert authorities and kept up the contact rather than bringing phone to the attention of authorities. 'Had . the prison authorities been notified about the phone then their actions . may have been different and that may well have affected the escape of . the prisoners. Her failure to notify authorities may have aided the . escape. Technology: The gang who assisted in the escape are believed to have used GPS to track the van . 'McCabe should have been aware of the serious nature of this. She was an experienced legal representative. She can’t have failed to have been aware of he serious impact of phones in prison.' Mitigating, Robert Kearney for McCabe, said: 'She immediately accepted it and recognised the foolishness of it in her interview. 'There couldn’t have been an earlier acceptance of wrongdoing on her part. The reality in this case is three texts of an unrelated nature to the escape. 'The defendant had nothing to do with the escape that involved McDonald and others. It was three texts made over 13 minutes on April 4. They were all work-related but all entirely foolish. Her own phone had been used at the this but that was only because her work phone was not fit for purpose. 'The authorities knew about McDonald’s access to telephones seven days prior to his escape. They knew the position of McDonald because they seized a SIM from him in prison prior to his escape. 'This amounts to a foolish lapse in judgement in a career that has lasted ten years. It is something she deeply regrets. She was of impeccable character. Her health has since suffered. 'She is currently prescribed medication for anxiety and depression and has been referred to counselling. She generally used to have a very sunny disposition.' MacDonald was jailed for seven years and ten months over the jewellery raids. He and his fellow inmate Steve McMullen, 31 are due to face court later over the escape. After the case Det Chief Insp Phil Reade of Greater Manchester Police said: “Sarah McCabe is a qualified and experienced legal representative who is fully aware of the law in relation to the contacting of clients on contraband phones. 'It goes without saying she is also fully aware of the consequences and it is therefore surprising that she would take such risks.'","Sarah McCabe, 33, sent three texts to convicted robber Ryan MacDonald .

Tragedy: Christopher Briggs, 25, got up in the middle of the night to go the toilet but skidded on the marble-like surface, falling flat on his back and head . A British holidaymaker was killed after walking across his Ibiza hotel room in socks and slipping and smashing his head on the shiny tiled floor. Christopher Briggs, 25, got up in the middle of the night to go the toilet but skidded on the marble-like surface, falling flat on his back and head, an inquest heard. He was found dead the following morning on the floor of the en suite bathroom by his roommate. Mr Briggs, a plumber from Blackburn, had been for a night out with seven friends on the Balearic party island during a 'lads' holiday'. The group had been drinking cocktails in a bar before making their way back to the two-star Hostal Apolo in San Antonio. Hotel security cameras from outside the room showed Mr Briggs and roommate Paul Burke return to their room at around 2.44am on Sunday August 4. Blackburn Coroners Court heard the video footage showed Mr Briggs to be 'drunk, as seen by the way he walked' and that he had difficulty opening the door. At 9.24 the following morning, cameras showed Mr Burke dashing out of his room and calling for help from neighbouring rooms before paramedics arrived. A post mortem examination carried out . by the Spanish authorities revealed Mr Briggs suffered severe head . injuries after falling to the floor, which they said could have . been caused by excessive alcohol consumption. Toxicology tests showed he had drunk the equivalent of seven or eight pints of beer. However, recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Michael Singleton ruled there was 'no evidence of crass stupidity', declaring the incident a 'tragedy'. The fall was said to have been 'serious enough to be the sole cause of death'. On holiday: Mr Briggs had been staying at the two-star Hostal Apolo (file picture) in San Antonio, Ibiza . Hotel: CCTV footage shows the group arriving back at 2.44am. Mr Briggs was found at 9am in the en suite . Devastated Mr Burke told the court his friend 'looked alright' when they left the bar to head home. Mr . Burke, 24, a part advisor for Volkswagen said: 'We went out as an eight . and then split into two groups of four. I wasn’t drunk but I had had a . few. 'Briggsy looked alright to me but I have seem him many times and it wasn’t nothing more than usual to be honest. He was drinking cocktails, like what you do on holiday, he had maybe one pint.' He added that he hadn’t heard anything during the night and only discovered his friend when he got up at around 9am, when he saw Mr Briggs lying on his back with some blood around his nose on the 'marbly and shiny' floor. He said: 'I just saw Briggsy, he had his head out of the door and his body halfway in the bathroom. He was laid on the floor on his back, his feet were in the bathroom. 'It was very slippy, it was tiled. He was wearing grey or blue socks. You know those marble floors, you can slip across them.' Grieving: Paul Burke, the friend who found Mr Briggs on August 4 after a night out, described events to Blackburn Coroner's Court. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death . 'Sensible and optimistic': Father Stephen, pictured outside court, paid tribute to his football-loving son . The party decided to cut their holiday short and arrived home three days earlier than planned. Coroner Mr Singleton told Mr Briggs’ family: 'As a father myself I can’t begin to imagine the pain. 'The . tragedy seems to be amplified by the fact he was in Ibiza a long way . from home, I can’t begin to imagine the trauma surrounding all that. 'This . is a nightmare beyond measure. I also offer my sympathies to Paul Burke . and the seven lads who had gone on holiday there couldn’t be anything . better than with your mates, what could be better than that. Island: The seven friends were staying in San Antonio, famously populated by tourists and party-goers . 'There is no evidence of crass . stupidity, he was a regular lad and went for a regular evening out, he . simply slips on the floor. I’m sure you have asked ""why Christopher? Why . my boy?"".' In a . statement, Mr Briggs' father Stephen, also a plumber, paid tribute to . his popular, sensible, and optimistic son, who he says had been looking . forward to the Ibiza holiday for a year. He said: ‘He was an easy-going, nice lad. Chris was an optimist too, to the extent that he had got his season ticket for Blackburn Rovers, thinking they were going to do great things. 'He was really looking forward to the holiday. We worked together for the last time on a bathroom in Manchester and he was really made up about going away. Everybody liked Christopher. He was a wonderful son and what happened was just a horrible thing. 'You never dream of this happening and it is something you never think you will experience. It is devastating losing your son, but I have also lost the person I worked with every day. Nobody would say anything ill of him. 'He loved his football and played five-a-side three times a week. He was sensible and quiet, but he liked to have a laugh with all his friends. Everybody will miss him so much. 'He was very, very popular. All our customers loved him.

A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's ruling that found the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy discriminated against minorities, and it took the unusual step of removing her from the case, saying interviews she gave during the trial called her impartiality into question. The city applauded the appeals court's decision. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, who was shouted down over the tactic by students during a speech at Brown University this week, said he was grateful for it. 'This is indeed an important decision for all New Yorkers and for the men and women of the New York City police department who work very hard day in and day out to keep this city safe,' he said. Random stops: The NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy was deemed discriminatory against minorities by judge Shira A. Scheindlin . The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the ruling by U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin will be on hold pending the outcome of an appeal by the city. But it may be a non-issue after next week's mayoral election: Democrat Bill de Blasio, who's leading in polls, has said he would drop objections to the ruling, which calls for major changes to the police tactic. The judge decided in August the city violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of blacks and Hispanics by disproportionally stopping, questioning and sometimes frisking them. She assigned a monitor to help the police department change its policy and training programs on the tactic. The three-judge panel heard arguments Tuesday. Lawyers in the case said the police department hasn't had to do anything except meet with a monitor since the judge's decision, but the city said police officers are afraid to stop and frisk people now and the number of stop-and-frisks has dropped dramatically. Judgement blocked: A New York federal appeals court blocked Shira A. Scheindlin's order requiring changes to New York City's stop-and-frisk program and removed her from the case . The appeals panel didn't change the deadline for the appeal and said it expected arguments in March, well after the new mayor takes office. It said Scheindlin needed to be removed because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by misapplying a ruling that allowed her to take the case and by giving media interviews and making public statements responding to criticism. Scheindlin said in a statement later Thursday she consented to the interviews under the condition she wouldn't comment on the ongoing case. 'And I did not,' she said. Shouted down: Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly says he is pleased with the decision to block Scheindlin's finding . She said some reporters used quotes from written opinions that gave the appearance she had commented on the case but 'a careful reading of each interview will reveal that no such comments were made.' She also defended her decision to direct the plaintiffs to bring the case to her, saying she took the most recent case because it was related to a previous case she heard. The 2nd Circuit said a new judge would be assigned randomly and will deal with any further rulings. It's possible the new judge could order a fresh set of reforms or review the trial testimony and decide the city didn't violate people's civil rights, but it would be highly unusual.Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades, but recorded stops increased dramatically under Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men. Future plans: Mayoral frontrunner Bill de Blasio will drop any objections to the ruling if he is elected New York City mayor . A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four minority men, who said they were targeted because of their races, and it became a class-action case. To make a stop, police must have reasonable suspicion that a crime is about to occur or has occurred, a standard lower than the probable cause needed to justify an arrest. Only about 10 per cent of the stops result in arrests or summonses, and weapons are found about two per cent of the time. Scheindlin heard a bench trial that ended in the spring and coincided with a groundswell of backlash against the stop-and-frisk tactic, which became a mayoral race flashpoint. She noted in her ruling this summer that she wasn't putting an end to the practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops. Public debate: Two men reenact the controversial 'stop-and-frisk' pose on a West Village street while in costume on Halloween day on October 31, 2013 in New York City . The Center for Constitutional Rights, which represented the four men who sued, said it was dismayed that the appeals court delayed 'the long-overdue process to remedy the NYPD's unconstitutional stop-and-frisk practices' and was shocked that it 'cast aspersions' on the judge's professional conduct and reassigned the case. De Blasio, the city's public advocate, said he was 'extremely disappointed' in Thursday's decision. 'We have to end the overuse of stop and frisk - and any delay only means a continued and unnecessary rift between our police and the people they protect,' he said in a statement. His Republican challenger, Joe Lhota, a deputy under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, praised it. 'The next mayor absolutely must continue this appeal,' he said.","A federal appeals court blocked a judge's ruling that found the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy discriminates against minorities .

Stalker: Daniel Rowlands, left, sent a series of threatening messages to Jade Davies, right, before creeping into her house, looking through her things and trying to hit her . He then crept into her home to look for evidence of her having a new boyfriend, before trying to attack her. Rowlands, from Caerphilly, South Wales, . had previously accused her of having a new boyfriend. He sent a message . asking 'Who's that boy?', and when she denied there was one, replied . with 'Liar'.

Fox 2 News has reported Mike Reda allegedly shot dead two women at Detroit's Pablo Davis Elder Living Center who were reportedly friends with his ex-girlfriend . A 65-year-old man allegedly shot dead two elderly women with an assault rifle at his nursing home on Sunday in the belief they convinced his ex-girlfriend to dump him. Fox 2 News reported Mike Reda grabbed an AK-47 from his room at Detroit's Pablo Davis Elder Living Center after having a fight with his girlfriend earlier in the day. Reda allegedly hunted down two of his former flame's friends in the center before shooting them dead about 5.45pm. Police said he shot a 54-year-old woman once as she sat outside the apartment building. She died in hospital. The gunman then allegedly shot a 65-year-old woman multiple times inside her apartment. She died at the scene. His ex-girlfriend was allegedly unharmed, but witnesses said she was at the scene. Meanwhile, local resident Paul Frantangelo claimed he was sitting outside the West Vernor Highway apartment complex with the 54-year-old victim when the gunman allegedly confronted him. 'He told me to get on the ground and start praying,' Frantangelo told Fox 2. 'He let off a round and he shot my friend in the head. My ears were starting to ring.' Frantangelo told Detroit News he was lucky he was spared. 'I didn’t see the rifle until he got right on top of us,' Fratangelo said. 'I said, ‘Oh my God. ...’ He said, ‘Get on the ground and start praying'. It was the grace of God that he didn’t shoot me. I really thought he was going to shoot me. I thought it was was over. Instead, he shot both my friends.' The incident happened at the Pablo Davis Elder Living Center in Detroit on October 20 .

Plans to build the controversial high-speed railway line linking London to the North of England were approved in a Commons vote yesterday. The High Speed Rail Preparation Bill was passed by 350 to 34 votes, giving a clear Government majority of 316 – despite the efforts of 17 rebel Tory MPs. The Bill, which would allow ministers to buy property from residents and businesses on the proposed track route, will now progress to the House of Lords for further scrutiny. An artist's impression of the potential HS2 train design: The High Speed Rail Preparation Bill, which will release funds for the project, was passed by 350 to 34 votes, giving a clear Government majority of 316 . HS2 was hailed as an ‘essential’ railway by David Cameron ahead of the vote. He said: ‘The fact is our West Coast mainline is full. Every day between Birmingham and London there are thousands of people standing on trains that need to be able to sit down and work.’ He added: ‘The question is, do we build an old-style rail line or one of these new-fangled high-speed ones like they are building in China and France? I think we should go for high speed. ‘The cost of high speed is only  9 per cent more. I hope Labour will see sense and stop talking about pulling the plug.’ The rebellion is smaller than the 21 Tory MPs who voted against the Bill at second reading. Labour’s threats to oppose the bill evaporated last night when they finally hinted they would back it, if the government could rein in the spiralling costs. The high speed rail line will only go as far north as Leeds and Manchester. But last night ministers announced a study to try and increase the benefits Scotland gets from HS2, pledging to slash journey times between London and Edinburgh and Glasgow to just three hours. Travel times between London and Glasgow or Edinburgh are already set to reduce from 3 hours 38 when the final phase of HS2 is operational in 2032. The planned route: The high speed rail line will only go as far north as Leeds and Manchester. But last night ministers announced a study to try and increase the benefits Scotland gets from HS2 . Transport Minister Baroness Kramer Westminster had instructed HS2 Ltd to improve rail capacity and journey times for passengers and freight to Scotland. She said: ‘Scotland will already benefit from day one with reduced journey times to and from London and once the full network is open these times will be reduced by up to an hour. However, we want to see if more can be done and so we are commissioning this study.’ Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said: ‘Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland. The goal of delivering a genuinely national network with high-speed services shows this Government is serious about promoting economic growth right across the UK.’ He added: ‘Tourism on both sides of the border will also be supported as the UK is opened up to faster travel.’ The HS2 Paving Bill approved in the Commons yesterday by 350 votes to 34 against will release the funding for the project, if its backed by the House of Lords. Funds will be used to buy property and compensate evicted families along the route, which runs through the picturesque English countryside. Tory MPs whose constituencies fall along the proposed railway have been largely opposed to the project while others have criticised the spiralling costs, which have already hit £50 billion including the cost of rolling stock. Despite their concerns, only 17 Tories ended up rebelling, including former Tory leadership hopeful David Davis. Many sceptics want to hold their fire until parliament votes next year on whether construction can begin. Opposition: An anti-HHS2 rail project sign stands outside the clubhouse of Whittington Health Golf Club, which sits on the planned route of the rail link, in Whittington. Many rural communities oppose the development . Stewart Jackson, the Tory MP for Peterborough, abstained on voting last night, saying: ‘The case for the project is threadbare and at the moment I’ll oppose the substantive legislation next year.’ Despite threats by Labour to withdraw their support for the project, the party lined up behind it because the bill is only paving legislation for funding. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said Labour would back the Bill after all. ‘Labour supports HS2 because we must address the capacity problems that mean thousands of commuters face cramped, miserable journeys into Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and London,” she said, outside the Commons. ‘However, government mismanagement has pushed up costs. Our message to David Cameron is clear. Get a grip on this project, get control of the budget and get it back on track.’ Her remarks are in contrast to other signals coming from Labour, including from shadow Chancellor Ed Balls who said he would not be writing blank cheques for the project if Labour wins the next election. This week it emerged that the expected benefits of HS2 compared to the costs had been lowered. The ‘benefit-cost ratio’ was reduced from £2.50 to £2.30 in benefits for every pound spent. This was mostly due to the increase in the total expected cost earlier this year. Rebels: Prominent Tory backbenchers Nadine Dorries and David Davis oppose the HS2 project . Nadine Dorries, Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire and opponent of the rail link said the money could be better spent on other projects. ‘There are other infrastructural priorities such as housing in our constituencies which are in desperate need and in areas of regeneration,’ she said. HS2 ‘actually deprives finance from those valuable projects’, she said. But fellow Conservative and former transport minister Simon Burns told MPs that Maidstone in Kent, which had opposed having the first high speed rail line in its patch was now ‘begging’ for a new station. The MP for Chelmsford said: ‘There was one town in Kent that successfully lobbied not to have a station in its place and that was Maidstone and they stopped it. ‘It was put at Ebbsfleet and now they are begging for a station at Maidstone because they are missing out on the regeneration and improvements to the economy that Ashford and Ebbsfleet are having.'","High Speed Rail Preparation Bill would allow ministers to secure route .

Residents from a suburban Los Angeles town are protesting over a judge's decision to let a convicted serial rapist live in their neighborhood when he's released from prison. Christopher Hubbart, 62, dubbed the ‘Pillowcase Rapist’ after being linked to dozens of sexual assaults on women during the 1970s and '80s, could be released as early as December. A judge in Santa Clara County has allowed him to move to a Lake Los Angeles home in the Antelope Valley community, close to a park, multiple schools and a bus stop, Fox News reported. A very sick man: Christopher Hubbart admitted to raping 38 women, but said about 70 other rapes went unreported . Now local residents have staged a protest and are circulating a petition to stop Hubbart from moving in. The depraved man has admitted to 38 rapes, but said there were about 70 unreported, according CBS Los Angeles. He is being released into the area because he previously resided in Los Angeles, officials said. Hubbart often placed pillowcases over his victims' heads to muffle their screams. Santa Clara County Judge Gilbert Brown ruled last week that Hubbart will be initially placed at 17132 Laredo Vista in Lake Los Angeles once released. However the conditions of Mr Hubbart’s release are sealed – people living on the street he is targeted to live on by the end of this year are not happy. ‘I have a daughter, so this isn't going to work for me,’ Bart Stone told NBC Bay Area. Also seen in a CBS Los Angeles report, Mr Stone stood in front of the house and pointed about 100 feet down the street to a school bus stop. Home sweet home: This is the Lake Los Angeles home officials have decided will house the serial rapist . ‘That’s where children get off,’ he angrily shouted. Residents have until November 29 to . submit their comments and complaints about the proposed location to the . judge - a website has been set up for comments. Judge Brown will hold a public hearing on Hubbart's proposed residence at the Santa Clara Country Court on December 4. The home is within a few miles of two . schools and only 2,200 feet from a nearby park – just outside the . limits of Jessica’s Law, which prohibits predators from living closer . than 2,000 feet to any park or school. The landlord of the property has agreed to rent the home to Hubbart, seeing as it falls within the laws for sex offenders. ‘The bus stop is right in front of my house, with all the kids,’ Steve Villavicincio told CBS Los Angeles, ‘I don’t know what the heck’s going on with that.’ Furious: Bart Stone says he has no choice but to move if the rapist relocates to the neighborhood . Just a door down from a bus stop: 'You see that right there, past the PT Cruiser, that's where the drop the kids off' Mr Stone points to and explains . Markeisha Brooks, 19, pointed to . three houses where children live, telling CBS Los Angeles that ‘a lot of . children live around here… he’s a rapist and he can do it again.’ Mr . Hubbart was put on parole multiple times, and kept raping women in both . the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas, terrorizing the state with . his deviancy. Officials are also united in their displeasure to dump the rapist in the community. The pervert’s most recent sojourn back into custody came because he couldn’t control his violent urges, Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich told KNX. ‘He belongs in a mental institution, a state hospital’ Mr Antonovich said during a recent press conference, ‘he does not belong in a community with children where he will once again commit these crimes.’ ‘His past behavior is not a one-time occurrence where he made a mistake. We’re talking over and over again,’ Mr Antonovich added. So many arrests: Mr Hubbart was released into parole multiple times, and he assaulted women every single time - forcing officials to arrest and reincarcerate him . ‘They're taking someone who is not from here — who has a horrific criminal record — and they're dumping him in the [area],’ a Palmdale city spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times. ‘We don't think that's right,’ the spokesperson added. Palmdale is only a handful of miles from the home slated to house Mr Hubbart. The modest ranch home was recently listed for rent on Craigslist. The ad asked $850 for the three bedroom, two bath house - it is no longer on the site. Mr Stone called the home’s owner . during a local media report, furiously asking if he knew who the rapist . was and asking why he’d rent to him. Other locations are also being considered, an official told the Times, but it will be in Los Angeles County. 'That's crazy': Steve Villavicincio lives next door, the bus stop is in front of his home, he cannot believe officials think the home is suitable for a rapist . Not in our neighborhood!: Residents are furious the predator is set to live only feet from a school bus stop and within a few miles of multiple schools . Mr Hubbart was first arrested in 1972 for multiple rapes in southern California, he soon admitted raping 20 women, records cited by the Times show. Only seven years later, he was released from a mental health institution after doctors deemed him a changed man. He was snagged again in 1982 for raping more women. Based on his own estimates, Mr Hubbart raped well over 100 women. ‘It really angers me,’ another local resident told the Times. ‘My wife and I are getting to the point where we're anxious to leave California anyway. That might get us to... move quicker.’ Mr Hubbart will be required to wear a GPS monitor at all times, an official told the Times. The monitor will be able to alert authorities if he violates the terms of his release by beng to close to a school or park, or even if he violates curfew. Still, that’s not enough to satisfy people living in the proposed area. ‘This is like a bad dream right now because I'm going to have to move out of this neighborhood,’ Mr Stone told NBC Bay Area . He doesn’t appear to be alone.","Christopher Hubbart admitted to 38 rapes, he told authorities another 70 went unreported .

Italy's prime minister has warned Europe's political elite to ramp up the fight against right-wing fringe parties such as UKIP or face 'the most Euro-sceptic, anti-European EU parliament in history'. Enrico Letta said the growing popularity of Britain's UK Independence Party, France's National Front (FN) - as well as Italy's anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) - was the 'most dangerous phenomenon' facing the EU and could scupper hopes of an economic recovery. He said if they manage to harness 25 per cent of the vote in parliamentary elections next May a 'very negative' effect could befall Brussels. Stark warning: Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, left, speaks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Brussels last week. He warned that the growth of Britain's UK Independence Party, France's National Front (FN) and Italy's anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) was the 'most dangerous phenomenon' facing the EU . 'I believe the risk of having the most anti-European European parliament in history is being greatly underestimated,' Letta told the Guardian and five other European newspapers. Describing the challenge as a 'great battle' between 'the Europe of the people and the Europe of populism', he added: 'If we want to move from the legislature of austerity to a . legislature of growth, and we find ourselves with the most Eurosceptic, . most anti-European parliament in history, this goal will be immediately . crippled, halted.' Speaking to a handful of European newspapers this morning, he said he wanted to 'sound the alarm' before voters in all 28 member states go to the polls between . May 22 and 25 to elect a new European parliament. It will sit until 2019. Nigel Farage's UKIP, Marine Le Pen's FN and a number of other similar parties from Poland, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria have enjoyed rapid surges in the polls with their tough stances on immigration and anti-EU policies appealing to disillusioned voters. 'Dangerous phenomenon': Nigel Farage's (left) UKIP, Marine Le Pen's (right) FN and a number of other similar parties from Poland, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria have enjoyed surges in the polls and are expected to do well in the upcoming elections . Alarm bells: Letta said he wanted to 'sound the alarm' before voters in all 28 member states will go to the polls between 22 and 25 May to elect a new European Parliament. It will sit until 2019. Pictured: The European Parliament building in Strasbourg . He said he and other Euopean leaders would be monitoring Britain carefully to see how well UKIP perform in the build up to the elections. 'A success of Nigel Farage's party would have very negative effects on the debate about Britain's exit from the EU,' he said. 'If one of the messages to come out of May's elections were that this party had placed first, it would certainly be seen as a step towards Britain's exit.' 'On this issue [Britain's exit],' he added, 'there is a bit of superficiality in Europe… This time, I believe, it could really happen.' Letta, who has spoken of his desire for a 'United States of Europe', went on: 'European citizens have to feel they are being represented by Europe and at the moment there is clearly a problem. 'This, I believe, is the winning issue for [M5S's Beppe] Grillo, for Farage, for Marine Le Pen, for all European populism – that, to the question 'Who represents Europe? Who represents us in it?' the response, unfortunately, is stuttering.' He also urged mainstream politicians to take extra care in their handling of the increasingly sensitive immigration debate or risk losing elections.","Enrico Letta slammed UKIP, France's National Front and other Eurosceptics .

A 37-year-old Missouri woman has been charged with having illegal sex with a 15-year-old girl and helping her ex-convict boyfriend dispose of her body last year in Truman Lake. Court documents unsealed last week show that Amy Leigh Hartley, 37, of Buffalo, faces charges of statutory sodomy, tampering with physical evidence and abandonment of a corpse. The felony complaint shows she also is charged with endangering the welfare of a child by allowing the teen, Khighla Parks, in her ‘uninhabitable’ home, where methamphetamine was made and used ‘to engage in sex with multiple partners, some of whom were known by the defendant to engage in asphyxiation sex.’ Accomplices: Amy Leigh Hartley (left), 37, was arrested in connection to the September 2012 death ofa Missouri teenager, which also allegedly invovled her boyfirned, 48-year-old Anthony Balbirnie (right) Tragic end: Khighla Parks, 15, who was Facebook friends with Balbirne, was reported missing on September 20, 2012, and was discovered dead in a lake 10 days later . After Parks’ September 2012 death, Hartley helped move the teen's body, according to the complaint. Hartley also is accused of washing bedding in an effort to thwart investigators. Anthony Balbirnie, a man described in court documents as Hartley's on-again, off-again boyfriend, has been charged with second-degree murder, statutory rape, child molestation, endangering the welfare of a child, tampering with physical evidence and abandonment of a corpse. A special prosecutor filed the charges against Balbirnie this month after the county prosecutor dropped a count alleging that he abandoned the corpse of Miss Parks. Balbirnie, 48, of Springfield, is incarcerated at the state prison in Bowling Green, where he is serving time for violating parole. Investigators believe Parks, a high school sophomore who loved horseback riding, met with Hartley and Balbirnie at the woman's home at 810 Locust Street in Buffalo on September 21, 2012. After engaging in sexual activities with the couple, which allegedly involved asphyxiation, the 15-year-old girl died. Gruesome find: A boatman came upon Parks' corpse with weights attached to it in Truman Lake . Police say Balbirnie took Parks' body, weighted it down and dumped it in Truman Lake, where it was discovered by a boater September 30. Hartley, who reportedly suffers from a brain injury sustained during a 2008 car accident, told police that her boyfriend helped wrap Parks' body and stuffed it in the trunk of a car and drove off en route to Truman Lake. Bizarre: Balbirnie, whose Facebook account features a mask with a swastika on it, has a long rap sheet containing multiple drug charges . Harlety faces up to 29 years in prison if convicted, Ozarks First reported. She is being held on $75,000 bond. Another man, Larry Warner, is listed as a co-defendant in the charging documents, but investigators are keeping mum on his alleged role in the case. Probable cause documents containing further details on the girl’s death and evidence against the suspects have been sealed by a judge at the request of the state attorney general, who cited safety concern to witnesses, the Springfield News-Leader said. Parks, who was Facebook friends with Balbirnie, was reported missing on September 20 after she left her grandparents' home in Willard to go for a walk. She was last seen alive at a party in Buffalo, Missouri with a crowd of people, around 40 miles away. The girl's grandmother Bonnie Adams told KY3: 'She had taken off a few days, went to a friend's house or something like that, so I gave her the 24 hours. Balbirnie was released from prison on parole in August 2012 after serving 15 months for possessing marijuana, according to the Missouri Department of Corrections. He was on probation for convictions in 2010 for unlawful use of weapons, manufacturing a controlled substance and resisting arrest with the intent to cause physical harm or death by fleeing. The 48-year-old has a long history of criminal charges from drug possession to resisting arrest. Life lost: Parks was a high school sophomore who loved horses and was a member of a riding group . Mystery suspect: Larry Warner (left), is listed as a co-defendant in the charging documents, but police are keeping mum on his alleged role in Parks' death . Balbirnie's long-inactive Facebook page features a profile picture of a mask with a swastika on the forehead. He describes himself as 'outgoing and energetic, likes to take long walks in the woods'. He was named a suspect in an attempted abduction in 2006 when a 16-year-old girl was allegedly taken against her will from a hotel room. The teen was later returned home and no charges were filed agaisnt Balbirnie because the girl allegedly told him she was 17 years old.","Amy Hartley is charged with statutory sodomy, tampering with evidence and abandonment of a corpse in Khighla Parks' death .

Catherine, from Colne, Lancashire, said: 'When I said I wanted to shave my head with her she told me that I would embarrass her if her mummy had a bald head, but she’d let Ben have his shaved. 'She’s the little boss and when we gave her the clippers she said ‘I’ll do it’. She was really proud of daddy when he’d had his done. 'She’d already had her hair all shaved and said to Ben, ‘come on dad it’s your turn, you are having yours off now’. 'Then she got him on the floor and turned on the clippers. It was so funny watching her because his hair was quite long and she was ragging his hair out and looked like she was having so much fun. 'We all had a really good giggle and it was the first time we’d seen her properly giggle in weeks, it had certainly been a very long time.

'She asked the nurses to bring in some shavers, she just announced ‘can you fetch the shavers in so we can shave my hair’. She even told us not to be upset because her hair would soon grow back. 'The nurse brought the shavers in and then took me out of the room and said, ‘I just want to tell you that in all my career and years working I have never had a child who is so positive about everything and wants her own hair shaving off’.

For all its planes and vans mapping out the world, there have been places even Google cannot reach. Now thanks to its latest weapon, the internet giant will be able to chart everywhere from the depths of the jungle to the narrowest city alley. Its backpack camera, which is carried by a trekker on foot, will be able to get to places that Google wings and wheels cannot. The device, a more portable version of its controversial Street View cameras, is able to go ‘offroad’, potentially photographing and mapping everywhere from the base of the Grand Canyon to the top of Everest. Campaigners have warned that privacy risks being sacrificed in a commercial race between Google and its rival Apple, which unveiled its latest mapping technology yesterday. The two are competing to produce three-dimensional maps and have deployed spy planes to photograph streets and homes. The planes will be able to operate in British skies without special licensing or permits. Google has also used its Street View cars to gather ground-level panoramic photographs. Once products are launched, state-of-the-art technology will allow iPhone and computer users to access 3D maps based on high-resolution photographs so detailed they can reveal objects just four inches across. Google said its new Street View Trekker backpacks, which took more than a year to develop, were ‘another step forward’ in its plans to produce an interactive and comprehensive map of the world. The 40lb backpack holds up a number of 15-megapixel cameras, an on-board hard drive, and enough battery to run for an entire day. Cameras are positioned to give a 360 degree view so every possible angle is captured. At the launch earlier this month, the US company said: ‘There’s a whole wilderness out there that is only accessible by foot. 'Trekker solves that problem by enabling us to photograph beautiful places such as the Grand Canyon so anyone can explore them.’ Google said only a handful of the backpacks had been made so far and it has not yet revealed if it intends to manufacture more. Google expects to have 3D map coverage of towns and cities with a combined population of 300million by the end of this year. Last night, Apple announced the launch of its controversial rival to Google Maps, which will offer 3D capability and a ‘flyover’ mode that gives users an aerial view of major cities. And in a development that could raise more questions about privacy, the company said its maps would use ‘anonymous, real-time data’ collected from iPhones to monitor traffic – without telling users what it was doing. The Grand Canyon is just one of the worldwide sites which could be revealed in great detail by Google's new contraption .","Street View Trekker camera can go 'offroad'

But the judge rejected the city's request for a temporary retraining order to halt production at the factory and instead set a hearing for November 22 to discuss whether the factory should shut down to address the odor complaints. Scroll down for video . Turned down: A judge in Southern California refused the City of Irwindale's request to temporarily shut down the Sriracha factory in order to address complaints about the odor . Complaints: Residents of the City of Irwindale who live around the factory have been complaining about the smell - saying that the odor burns their eyes, makes their throats itch and causes headaches . 'It's rather edgy,' Judge Robert H. O'Brien said. 'You're asking for a very radical order on a 24-hour notice. You probably should have come in earlier.' Judge O'Brien's ruling was a big win for the hot sauce company. It's currently peak chili harvesting season, and they do most of their work between September and December. Huy Fong initially cooperated with the city, but talks broke down last week after company representatives denied there was an odor problem, saying their employees worked in similar olfactory settings without complaint, Mr Galante said. Never enough hot sauce: The judge's ruling was a big win for Huy Fong Foods which does most of the processing and storing of the sauce between September and December . Going forward: But the company isn't out of the clear yet. The judge set up a hearing for November 22 to discuss further whether to shut down the factory while the odor issue is addressed . The city, which is about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, is seeking closure of the factory until Huy Fong submits a plan to minimize the smell. 'If they fix it and the odor problems stop, we don't need this order; but so far the odor complaints continue,' Mr Galante said. The company's lawyer, John R Tate, said that they had installed odor air-quality regulators to address the issue and that shutting down the factory would prevent the analysis from being completed. Air quality experts have been brought in and their initial reports found that there was no detectable aroma 209 feet from the exhaust system. They only places where they noticed an odor was in the lobby (rated 1 on a scale of 10) and near the exhaust hood over where the chilies are ground (rated 3). Assembly: Chili peppers are loaded onto a conveyer belt to be ground into Sriracha hot sauce earlier this week . Huy Fong Foods' owner David Tran pointed out that the smell is part of what makes his product so popular, and that shutting the factory impacts the consumer more than the producer. 'If it doesn't smell, we can't sell,' he told the Los Angeles Times . 'If the city shuts us down, the price of Sriracha will jump a lot.' Huy Fong's green-capped chili bottles are hugely popular and are a fixture in restaurants and pantries around the world. The first Sriracha Festival held in downtown Los Angeles over the weekend drew hundreds of fans. Tran was there sporting a T-shirt that said 'I put Sriracha on my Sriracha.' The company had operated out of two buildings in nearby Rosemead since the late 1980s until it opened large factory in Irwindale this year.","A judge ruled today that Huy Fong Foods can continue to produce Sriracha hot sauce at their factory in Irwindale, California .

Nine months ago, Anna Trickett was a popular, enthusiastic schoolgirl who enjoyed spending time with her family and friends. Now her parents say their beautiful ten year old has turned into a violent ‘caged animal’ who lashes out at them, screams and refuses to walk or talk. The cause of the disturbing transformation is a rare condition which Anna developed after suffering a minor ear infection. Anna Trickett was a popular, bubbly child until she got a simple ear infection. After the infection, she developed Pervasive Refusal Syndrome - a rare psychological condition. She is pictured before she fell ill . She is the third person in the UK to . be diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder known as pervasive refusal . syndrome (PRS). It is a debilitating condition in which sufferers shun . daylight and become violent towards those around them. Anna now spends . most of her time under blankets in her room with the curtains closed, . lashes out at her parents and often has to be force-fed.

Anna (pictured before ill) spends most of her time under blankets in her room with the curtains closed, lashes out at her parents and often has to be force fed . Anna (pictured with her brother, Toby, and parents, Scott and Libby before she became ill) has not voluntarily been outside during the day, or seen any friends, for nine months. She uses a wheelchair because she believes she cannot walk . Her parents Scott Trickett, 40, and . Libby Bryant, 49, first took their daughter into hospital with a viral . ear infection last November. PRS is a rare but serious psychiatric disorder that was first described in 1991. It’s characterised by refusal to eat, drink, talk, walk, or self-care, and a firm resistance to treatment. The . disorder usually begins with a virus that results in the need for . consulting a doctor or going to the hospital, even though no substantial . cause can be found. PRS starts slowly, but the child then worsens quickly becoming reluctant to, or not capable of, doing anything for themselves. They refuse to accept others caring for them, or helping them eat, and are very depressed and distraught. It is not guaranteed that recovery will take place, and it is a lengthy and complex process, involving specialist medical care. In the weeks that followed, her personality . transformed drastically and she became withdrawn and aggressive. She has been diagnosed with PRS – a . rare disorder that has affected only a handful of people in Britain . since it was recognised in 1991 and makes children ‘abandon involvement’ in their lives. The disorder is triggered by a virus . or infection. Anna developed an intolerance to sunlight and needs . black-out blinds, thick curtains and a duvet to block any trace of light . in her bedroom. When family members and doctors have . visited at home, Anna’s outbursts have been so violent that frightened . neighbours  have called the police. Miss Bryant, a lifeguard from . Plymouth, Devon, said: ‘It’s been horrible. Anna went from a lovely, . polite, well-mannered child to a little girl who seemed possessed. 'It . was as though someone had taken our little girl away and replaced her . with a disturbed and completely different person. ‘Police have barged in a couple of . times thinking we’re abusing Anna because it sounds like she’s being . violently attacked because of all the banging and intense screaming. Our . house is now flagged on the police system so if they get called again . they are aware of her condition.’ When family members and doctors have visited Anna (pictured before ill) at home her outbursts have been so violent that frightened neighbours have called the police . She added: ‘We always knew that . Anna’s out-of-character behaviour was not her fault. When we got her . diagnosis it all became a lot clearer and made much more sense. ‘She’s got a very serious illness and we love her just the same in spite of everything.’ After Anna's condition worsened in February, she spent six weeks in Frenchay Hospital in Bristol where she was kept in isolation because of her violent outbursts and was force-fed through a tube. She is pictured here before she became ill . After Anna’s condition worsened in . February she spent six weeks in hospital where she was fed through a . tube and kept in isolation because of her violent outbursts. Anna’s parents, who also have an . eight-year-old son called Toby, decided to bring her home to provide . 24-hour care. Mr Trickett, 40, a leisure centre supervisor, said: ‘She . hides under her duvet for protection. It’s as though she’s in her own . little world.’ The couple say, however, that there . have been glimpses of the old Anna since she came home. Anna's parents hope that she is starting to improve as she left the house voluntarily for the first time in months and has started to show interest in drawing and painting again.

Dr Stephen Westgarth, medical . director of Child Psychiatry UK, said PRS was a complex disorder  that . was not included in the standard psychiatric classification systems.  He . added: ‘The severity of pervasive refusal disorder varies from child to . child. ‘One child may simply refuse to go to school as a result of the disorder, while others may refuse to clean, eat or even drink. ‘As is seen in this case, obsession . and anxiety are common effects of the disorder. The child often feels . they need control, routine and predictability for safety reasons. ‘At its worst the disorder can be life-threatening.’ Anna's parents are now raising money to get her treatment from a London-based specialist.

Women experience more mental health problems than men due to the stress of juggling many roles, according to a new book. Professor Daniel Freeman, of the University of Oxford, said the first systematic investigation of national mental health surveys showed psychological disorders are 20 to 40 per cent more common in women than men in any given year. Stress related to pressure on women to fill many different roles is likely to be a major factor for higher rates of everything from depression to phobias, according to Professor Freeman, a clinical psychologist. The investigation found that psychological disorders are 20 to 40 per cent more common in women than men . 'The biggest discrepancies occur in conditions for which we know the environment, rather than genes, makes the greatest causal contribution,' he said. 'It's certainly plausible that women experience higher levels of stress because of the demands of their social role. 'Increasingly, women are expected to function as carer, homemaker, and breadwinner - all while being perfectly shaped and impeccably dressed. 'Given that domestic work is undervalued, and considering that women tend to be paid less, find it harder to advance in a career, have to juggle multiple roles, and are bombarded with images of apparent female 'perfection', it would be surprising if there weren't some emotional and psychological cost. 'These are the kind of pressures that can leave women feeling as if they've somehow failed; as if they don't have what it takes to be successful; as if they've been left behind. And those kinds of feelings can lead to psychological problems like anxiety and depression.' Men have higher rates of alcohol, drug and anger problems, according to Professor Freeman . 'The Stressed Sex: Uncovering the Truth about Men, Women, and Mental Health', published today discloses that women have higher rates of depression, panic disorder, phobias, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders. Men have higher rates of alcohol, drug and anger problems, according to Professor Freeman and co-author Jason Freeman, a writer and editor. Professor Freeman is a professor of clinical psychology, a Medical Research Council (MRC) Senior Clinical Fellow, in the University of Oxford's Department of Psychiatry and an honorary consultant clinical psychologist at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust. He said traditionally it has been said that overall rates of mental health problems in men and women are the same 'but the evidence shows that this is simply not the case'. 'Overall, in the current environment women are bearing the brunt of mental health problems,' he said. 'But let's be clear, even for problems that are more common in women - such as anxiety and depression - they also afflict very significant numbers of men. 'So it would be wrong to categorise mental health troubles as essentially a female problem. Rates of mental health problems are too high in both genders.' According to Mind, the mental health charity, around 300 people out of 1,000 will experience a mental health problem in Britain every year. Around 230 of these will visit a GP, 102 will be diagnosed with a mental health problem, 24 will be referred to a specialist psychiatric service and six will become inpatients in psychiatric hospitals. While women are more likely to report psychological problems than men, Professor Freeman said this does not explain the overall gender differences. He acknowledged that the findings are bound to be controversial but said the issue cannot be ignored because psychological disorders account for almost half of all ill-health in under 65s and affect up to nine million adults in the UK. In fact, Professor Freeman argues that the taboo around gender differences in mental health must be broken in order to tackle disorders more successfully in future. 'Given the extent of the burden on society and individuals alike, understanding what causes mental health problems, and thus being better placed to prevent and treat it, is vitally important,' he added. 'But our ability to do that is going to be hampered if we assume that gender isn't significant. In fact, it may often be a crucial contributory factor. 'Men and women are very much from the same planet but they may be breathing air of different qualities. If we ignore the potentially higher rates of psychological problems in women, we deprive ourselves of the opportunity to change the situation for the better.'","Psychological disorders are 20% to 40% more common in women than men .

Yet the immortal photograph of three New York City firefighters raising the U.S. flag at Ground Zero after the September 11 attacks was nearly left out of the 9/11 Memorial Museum because staff thought it was too 'rah-rah' American. Creative director Michael Shulan was among staffers who believed the Thomas E. Franklin photo - which has been compared to the World War II Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima image - was too kitsch, according to Elizabeth Greenspan's new book Battle for Ground Zero. Thomas E. Franklin's iconic post-September 11 photo has become an emblem of hope . 'I really believe that the way . America will look best, the way we can really do best, is to not be . Americans so vigilantly and so vehemently,' Shulan said, according to Greenspan's book. The New York Post reports . chief curator Jan Ramirez offered a compromise - that the Franklin shot . be 'minimized' in favor of three different photos of the flag-raising . scene at three different angles. Michael Shulan, 9/11 Memorial Museum creative director, initially agreed with some staffers that the iconic Ground Zero image was too 'rah rah' American to be included in exhibition . Ramirez believed it could be valuable to show the event from 'multiple points of view, like the attacks more broadly'. 'Several images undercut the myth of ‘one iconic moment,' Ramirez said, according to the book. 'Shulan didn’t like three photographs more than he liked one, but he went along with it.' Shulan later told the New York Post that reducing the historical event to one picture was too simplistic. 'My . concern, as it always was, is that we not reduce [9/11] down to . something that was too simple, and in its simplicity would actually . distort the complexity of the event, the meaning of the event,' he said. Franklin's moving image, first published by The Record the day after the attacks, has become an enduring emblem of hope for Americans. It is considered one of the most widely reproduced images, printed on 255 million 'Heroes' postage stamps which has raised over $10 million to help 9/11 families and rescue workers.

Now feminist writer Suzanne Scoggins is addressing the growing issue with her website TakeBackHalloween.org. Bursting with ideas for female costumes that don't put sex appeal front and center, the site seems to be filling a much-needed gap in the market.

Taking back Halloween: Suzanne Scoggins' site provides an alternative to the usual sexy costumes on offer . 'If a girl wants to be Sally Ride, the message . is she can’t. If there‘s a girl costume, it’s an orange tube dress that . looks like a Hooters waitress. . . or a sexy policewoman or sexy firefighter. It makes me feel like we’re back in the 60’s. The message we’re giving . our daughters and sons is incredible. . . Sexy . costumes for women went from being an option to a requirement.' Ms Scoggins, who runs her site with a team of volunteers, is well-placed to offer guidance in costume design. She trained as a historian before turning to theater where she worked as both an actor and in costume design. She says the idea for the site was born because her friends couldn’t find anything appropriate to wear for trick or treating in with their . kids. 'Even college girls feel under pressure to be sexy,' she said. 'They didn’t . feel free to wear regular costumes and step outside that very narrow . uniform.

"By . Claire Ellicott . UPDATED: . 20:22 EST, 22 February 2012 . The father of a man who drowned in  3ft of water after emergency crews were ordered not to rescue him has hit out at health and safety rules that ‘hinder’ the 999 services. David Burgess, whose son Simon lay floating face down in a lake for more than half an hour while firemen, police and paramedics watched, said it was impossible to ‘eliminate all risk’ for the emergency services. A fire crew claimed safety rules stopped them from going more than ‘ankle-deep’ into the water after they decided the charity worker was ‘already deceased’. PC Tony Jones, left, who offered to dive into the lake, was ordered not to by station watch manager Tony Nicholls, who thought Mr Burgess was already dead and the water was too deep . Critical: David Burgess arrives at the inquest yesterday heard there was a . ‘slim’ chance his son could have survived if he had been brought out . of the water quickly . And a policeman and a paramedic who both volunteered to jump in were given orders not to do so by a fire station watch manager. Yesterday an inquest heard there was a . ‘slim’ chance Mr Burgess could have survived if he had been brought out . of the water quickly. Afterwards his father said: ‘We . appreciate that the emergency services operate in difficult situations . where split second decisions are required, but it is also clear that . they are often hindered by rules and procedures that attempt to . eliminate all risk when by its very nature effective emergency work will . always have some risk.’ Tragedy: Simon Burgess, right, feeds the swans at the lake in Gosport, Hampshire, where he drowned a few months after this picture was taken . His criticisms came as the coroner . demanded the fire, police and ambulance services improve their training . to prevent a future tragedy. Coroner David Horsley ruled the . 41-year-old’s death was an accident on the balance of probabilities, but . said there was a chance ‘albeit a slim one’ he could have been saved . had the emergency services intervened sooner. He called for a review of ‘protocol’ to ‘get the best possible guidance for situations like this where a life . may hang in the balance’. 'Too deep': Emergency services are pictured here just after they recovered the body from the lake. They had refused to get into the water until specialists arrived because it was 'too deep' Wading out: Following the delay, a pair of firefighters make their way into the centre of the waist-deep lake to attempt to rescue Mr Burgess . Probe: Police cordon off the scene following the tragedy. The inquest heard today there was a 28 minute delay before Mr Burgess was pulled from the water after the first phone call was made . Mr Horsley said: ‘I’ve considered . whether an earlier recovery of Simon could have saved his life. I . believe there might have been a chance, albeit a slim one, that the . outcome might have been different if there was a speedier recovery. ‘The delay in the recovery has not . been a significant factor in this tragic case. The death was down to an . accident, Simon was doing something he did every day and had an . epileptic seizure.’ Mr Burgess had been feeding swans at . the Walpole Park lake in Gosport, Hampshire, on March 10 last year. He . went into the water to retrieve a plastic bag and fell unconscious after . having a fit, the coroner ruled. Firemen arrived within five minutes . but refused to go into the water because it was above ‘ankle deep’. Instead, they waited for a specialist water rescue team to arrive. Although fire crews were sent almost immediately it was 35 minutes before Simon Burgess was recovered from the water. Pathologist Dr Bret Lockyer said if he had been pulled out sooner there was a 'slim chance' he could have been saved. The timeline on March 10 was as follows: . 12.17pm: Gillian Hughes rings the Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service control room and speaks to Deborah Coles, the control room manager. 12.18pm: Fire engine, water rescue trained crew and a water support unit are sent. Police, ambulance and coastguard are also dispatched. 12.20pm: Fire crews arrive. 12.25pm: They . report to their control room a male is floating down in the water. Around this time, Gillian Hughes says they refused to go into the water. 12.31pm: The water support unit arrive. 12.46pm: They request that the press officer attends the scene. 12.52pm: Firefighters report to their control room that Simon Burgess is recovered from the water. 12.58pm: He is taken to hospital. 1.42pm: He is formally pronounced dead. Speaking after the inquest, Mr . Burgess’s father said: ‘We will never know if Simon could have been . saved if he had been pulled from the water as soon as the emergency . services arrived on the scene or if it was already too late for him.’ Fire station watch manager Tony . Nicholls took the decision that Mr Burgess was already dead so the . operation was a body recovery, rather than a rescue. PC Tony Jones, who . volunteered to go in, told the inquest: ‘When I spoke to witnesses and . found out the body hadn’t been there long I told my sergeant I was . willing to go into the water. 'He authorised me to do so and I took off . my body armour but Mr Nicholls advised me strongly not to go in. ‘I said I would go in anyway and . asked if I could borrow his life jacket but he said “No”, but I was . going to do it regardless. It didn’t sit right with me that no one was . going to get the body or assist the person in the water. The control . room was informed I was going in and they sent a message that under no . circumstances could I go in.’ Mr Nicholls told the inquest: ‘There . were no obvious signs of life so I made an assessment it was a body . retrieval and not a rescue. If there had been signs of life we would . have gone in immediately.’ Delivering his verdict, Mr Horsley, . said he was ‘concerned’ by the assessment of the fire service and their . lack of training. A spokesman for Hampshire Fire and Rescue said: ‘Our . officers and firefighters make difficult decisions and professional . judgments every day, whatever the situation or incident. ‘Their actions are based on training, . balanced judgment and assessments based on the information and . circumstances they are faced with in a dynamic situation.’ Last year a coroner said emergency . services should be prepared to ‘risk their lives’ for the public. At the . inquest on the victims of the Cumbrian gun massacre, David Roberts said . it was disturbing that paramedics were prevented from reaching the . injured because of red tape which cost vital minutes. Firefighters need to be trained to water rescue level two if they want to go into a three foot deep lake, the inquest heard. The rules are set down in the firefighters own health and safety policy document LSO 34. Under the wording of the rules, rescuers trained to level one can only go into water that is ankle deep. During the two-day level two training session firefighters have to go to lectures, conduct exercises and take part in practical demonstrations. Although one of the first responders was 'level two' trained he did not have appropriate equipment with him - so Mr Burgess was left in the water, the inquest was told. The Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service website sets out the full details of the level two course - as set out below: .

Hotel plunge: Abbie Emmett, 27, died just days after she had arrived in Dubai with her new husband . A 27-year-old British bride is believed to have plunged to her death from a hotel room while on honeymoon in Dubai. Abbie Emmett died just days after she had arrived in the United Arab Emirates with her new husband Sean, 43, a former professional Grand Prix motorbike racer, following their wedding in South Africa. Police in Dubai were investigating what happened after Mrs Emmett, who is a vicar’s daughter, was reported to have fallen out of a window at the hotel last Tuesday. She had been sharing a flat in Addlestone, Surrey, with Mr Emmett, a divorced father of three, and was said to have married him around two weeks ago in Cape Town. Their neighbour Nicolene Turvey, 27, said: 'I feel so sad. She is such a young girl, the same age as me. 'It's devastating for everyone. She really wanted to have kids.’ Mr Emmett has now retired from racing but is still a private instructor and has been the winner of 19 superbike races as well as clocking up more than 50 MotoGP appearances. A Foreign Office spokesman said it was providing consular assistance to the family at 'this difficult time'. He added: ‘We were made aware of the death of a British national in Dubai on 19 February.

As it is revealed more than half of Britons would pull out of EU, David Cameron will finally make a speech setting out his vision for the UK's relationship with Europe . Britain is becoming a more Eurosceptic country – with a majority saying they would vote to leave the EU. A poll has revealed that 51 per cent of respondents want to get out of Europe, against just 40 per cent who want to stay in. The survey represents a massive turnaround on a decade ago, when a similar poll found we wanted to stay in Europe by a margin of 68 per cent to 19 per cent. Euroscepticism has also hardened since the pollsters last asked the same question just over a year ago when 49 per cent wanted to leave, against 40 per cent who wanted to remain in the EU. The revelation follows months of crisis in the eurozone, including fears over the collapse of the single currency. And support for UKIP is at its strongest for years, with the anti-Europe party overtaking the Lib Dems in the polls and coming second in the recent Rotherham by-election. Meanwhile, David Cameron is to finally make a long-anticipated speech setting out his vision for the UK’s relationship with Europe. The Prime Minister is expected to announce that he will include a pledge in the Tory manifesto to hold a referendum on whether voters want to maintain the status quo, or see powers repatriated from Brussels. Mr Cameron has faced calls from backbenchers to hold a simple in-out referendum on the EU. Yesterday Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘This poll is really significant. We are now seeing a majority wanting to quit.’ The ICM poll for The Guardian shows opponents of the European ideal are particularly determined to leave. Some 36 per cent said they would definitely vote to pull Britain out, against just 22 per cent who want to stay in. That compares with 18 per cent who say they would probably want to stay in, and 15 per cent who would probably want to get out. Another 9 per cent did not know. The revelation follows months of crisis in the eurozone, including fears over the collapse of the single currency . When split along party lines, there is a clear majority among Tory voters in favour of pulling out. The poll shows that 57 per cent of Conservatives want to leave the EU, compared with 44 per cent of Labour voters. Even among the Lib Dems, the most pro-European party, a third (34 per cent) want out. Broken down further, it shows 41 per cent of Tories definitely want to leave the EU. Men are more likely to be anti-Europe with 40 per cent definitely wanting to leave, while only 32 per cent of women take the same view. The older a person gets, the more anti-European they are. Some 49 per cent of pensioners definitely want to leave, compared with just 16 per cent of those aged between 18 and 24. Hostility to Europe is more marked in England and less so among professionals. Only 32 per cent of voters in the top AB social group definitely want to leave the EU, compared with 45 per cent of C2 skilled manual workers. Whereas in England 38 per cent are in this hardline camp, in Scotland and Wales the figures are 27 and 26 per cent. Mr Cameron is expected to use his speech to offer a referendum on the terms of EU membership after 2015. The poll results on how public would vote on a referendum on the European Union . He will demand a new settlement as the price of British support for a major revision of the Lisbon Treaty to underpin new governance arrangements for the eurozone. A group of Eurosceptic Tories last night called on Mr Cameron to set out two ‘nuclear’ options to European leaders to ensure key British interests are protected in a reformed EU. A manifesto unveiled by the Fresh Start group said the UK needed to take a hardline stance because Germany’s Chancellor, Angela Merkel, wants to deepen the powers of the bloc. Andrea Leadsom, Tory MP for South Northamptonshire, said option one would be an effective veto over financial services regulations. Option two would be to join with like-minded states to end the working time directive, which says no one must work longer than 48 hours a week.","A poll has revealed 51 per cent of people questioned want to get out of Europe .

A 45-year-old man has died after attempting to 'surf' on top of a New York City subway car while allegedly high on synthetic marijuana. The 'subway surfer' smashed his head on a beam overhead as the train pulled into the station on Wednesday afternoon, witnesses say. He saw the overhead metal bar coming and tried to climb down from the top of the car, but could not move in time. The man hat climbed on top of a 6 train in Manhattan, New York. He died when an overhead beam bashed him in the head . He fell off and tumbled in between the train cars, though it does not appear he was run over. Pablo Reyes told DNA Info that he was a friend of the dead man and that they stayed in the same homeless shelter. Mr Reyes said the man, called 'Grump,' had just smoked synthetic marijuana, also called K2, when he decided to climb out of the train car and on top of it. 'He was hanging out getting high. I told him, ""Stop getting high off that s***. It ain’t no good for you."" He probably was hallucinating,' Mr Reyes told the New York Daily News. The man climbed atop the downtown 6-train as it was running between East 125th Street and East 96th Street along Lexington Avenue on Wednesday afternoon.

When . the babies were born in Guthrie, Oklahoma on July 17, they shared a . liver and intestines. Mrs Ezell, and her husband Dave, who have two . other sons, moved to Dallas for the boys' medical care. On . Saturday, they were prepared for surgery and a team of doctors, . surgeons and nurses worked to separate the boys, either of whom could . have been lost in the operation, NewsOK reported. At a press conference at the medical center, Ms Ezell excitedly said: 'I have two babies … two separate babies!' Her husband added: 'A couple of pretty good looking babies, I’d say.' 'The . whole pregnancy was very frightening,' Mrs Ezell said. 'I didn’t know . what would happen. I didn’t know if they would make it ... But, the . boys, right now, are doing well.' Joy: Jenni Ezell says knowing her six-week-old babies are thriving is the best feeling in the world . Relief: Dave and Jenni Ezell say they can start planning for their sons' futures after the operation . The couple were told the were expecting conjoined twins in March, and had been advised by one doctor to have an abortion, according to CBS 11. 'We didn’t think that they had a chance. We thought they were not going to make it at all. So we decided to abort,' Mrs Ezell said. 'It was the hardest decision that a mother has to make about her babies.' However, a specialist at Medical City Dallas renewed their faith, telling them 'These boys have a really good chance. This is not your only option.' Although they can't hold their babies yet, the Ezells are finally able to start planning their futures. 'Taking them home and having Christmas with them - I’m already planning their first birthday parties,. I'm looking forward to everything,' Mrs Ezell said.

They will need further surgeries in the future; after they are two-years-old, they will require 'skin expanders' for their wounds, their mother explained. Another operation will require surgeons to pull abdominal muscles into place, which should leave them with only a neat line of a scar . After this, if the parents wish, they can opt for the boys to have a third surgery to create a belly button for each of them. But for now, the family is just taking it one day at a time. 'They're starting to open their little . eyes, and they're starting to wiggle their little fingers,' their . father, Dave Ezell, told NBC-DFW. 'You can see that recognition in their . face.

Roughly one out of every 200,000 live births worldwide results in conjoined twins, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. Around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and about 35 per cent survive only one day. The survival rate is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent, the Center reported. The condition is three times more likely to occur among females than males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest, sharing organs. Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, experts say. Although success rates have improved over the years, surgical separation is still rare. Since 1950, at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time. After separation, most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines. Although risky, there are many stories of successful separations. Most recently, Utah twins Kendra and Maliyah Herrin, who were born sharing an abdomen, pelvis, liver, kidney, large intestine and two legs, just celebrated seven years since they were separated aged four. Their family said the girls, who are learning to walk with the aid of prosthetics, are the happiest and healthiest they have ever been.","Owen and Emmett Ezell shared a liver and intestines when they were born .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 05:39 EST, 3 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:22 EST, 3 December 2012 . Free childcare places should be scrapped for middle-class families with help targeted at poorer children, education watchdog Ofsted claims today. Sue Gregory, the inspectorate's National Director of Education, warns funding is spread ‘very thinly’ in offering all three-year-olds 15 hours at a nursery or childminder during term time. She suggests childcare should instead be funded on the same basis as the coalition’s Pupil Premium in schools, where schools receive extra cash linked to the number of children from the poorest families. All three-year-olds are eligible for 15 hours free childcare in term time, with extra help planned for two-year-olds from poorest families. (file pic) The soaring cost of childcare has become a major issue for the government, with some studies suggesting a family where a second earner takes a job on the minimum wage will be just £4-a-week better off than if they stayed at home. Family policy championed by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has seen childcare provision extended to two-year-olds from the 40 per cent of least well-off families. But in a lecture today, Ms Gregory suggests the universal subsidy for three-year-olds is not working. ‘Universal provision has spread resources very thinly and it's crucial that lessons are learnt from current schemes in operation,’ she was due to say Foundling Museum in Central London. ‘Schools receive additional funding for their most disadvantaged pupils through the Pupil Premium. ‘A similar scheme could work in early years to help ensure that high quality staff are employed where the two-year-old offer is most needed.’ From January child benefit is being cut for families where one person earns more than £50,000, and any further attempt to target cuts on well-off parents will be politically-contentious. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg launched plans for the poorest two-year-olds to be offered 15 hours of free childcare . Ms Gregory says a Pupil Premium-style . funding system for under-5s would help close the gap in learning . between children from different backgrounds. In . her speech she does not explicitly say that funding for middle class . families should be cut outright, but at a time of austerity across . Whitehall any attempt to target poorer children would come at a cost for . others. She is also using Ofsted’s first annual lecture on early years to call for nursery staff to be better trained to look after young children. ‘All those working with young children should be highly skilled and qualified to degree level,’ Ms Gregory said. ‘If we’re serious about investing in a better-qualified workforce we should pay more. Nursery staff wages often hover around the minimum and even a graduate early years professional earns only half a teacher’s salary.’ At the moment, individuals need higher grades to train to work as a veterinary assistant than to work with young children, she says. Any attempt to increase the entry-level requirements for nursery workers would push up costs. A Government-commissioned review published in June concluded that qualifications for childminders and nursery staff are failing to provide the knowledge and skills needed to care and teach young children. It called for a major revamp of the system with all staff educated to A-level standard. Students should also have to have English and maths at GCSE level before they begin an early education or childcare course, the Nutbrown review said. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘All three and four-year-olds are already entitled to free early education. ‘We are expanding this entitlement so that around 130,000 two-year-olds will have 15 hours of free early years education from next September, doubling to more than a quarter of a million two-year-olds from September 2014. ‘We want to improve the quality of early education and childcare qualifications. We asked Professor Cathy Nutbrown to look at this and we will respond to her recommendations shortly.’","Watchdog's director of education says funding is spread too 'thinly' and should be focused on poorest families .

Theresa May last night promised to change the law to stop terrorists abusing human rights appeals after finally getting rid of Abu Qatada. In a huge personal victory for the Home Secretary, the hate preacher was flown out of Britain from RAF Northolt at 2.46am yesterday. The Al Qaeda fanatic – who was pictured smirking through the window as his plane took off – is now locked in a Jordanian jail after being formally charged with two terrorist conspiracies, although his lawyer says he will immediately apply for bail. Scroll down for video . Radical Islamist cleric Abu Qatada sits in the backseat of a police car outside the state security court in Amman .

Mahmoud Othman Omar, the father of Abu Qatada, looks on as he makes his way to the State Security Court . His deportation brought to a close a . legal circus which lasted for almost ten years and cost the British . taxpayer £1.7million. Millions more were spent on surveillance and will . continue to be spent on state handouts for his wife and five children, . who remain in the UK. The Prime Minister said Qatada’s . continued presence here had been ‘making his blood boil’, and vowed to . back Mrs May in her fight with human rights judges. Mrs May said she had been as . ‘frustrated as the British public’ at the length of time it has taken to . deport Qatada, who was Osama bin Laden’s ‘spiritual ambassador’ in . Europe. Abu Qatada has finally been deported from Britain after a 10-year legal battle that has cost taxpayers an estimated £2million. Qatada's plane left the airfield at about 2.45am . The Government has been trying to deport him to Jordan, where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999, for about a decade . The 53-year-old hate preacher left Belmarsh prison shortly after midnight on Sunday morning in a police convoy. He was taken to RAF Northholt, from where he was flown in a private jet to Jordan . She promised to use a new Immigration . Bill to ensure that similar deportations can be carried out much . quicker and to reduce the number of appeals available. The Home Secretary and Prime Minister . also threatened to withdraw from the European Court of Human Rights if . cannot be persuaded to stop meddling. Mrs May said: ‘As far as I am . concerned, I think nothing should be off the table in terms of looking . at how we work with and how we deal with the European Court.’ The Home Office chartered a small private jet to carry Qatada to Jordan. They had previously refused to confirm or deny reports that he would be leaving the country . David Cameron tweeted his pleasure at the news just hours after Qatada left Britain aboard a private flight . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said . there will be a replacement for the Human Rights Act ‘at a minimum’ if . the Conservatives won the next election. His department faces a potentially . explosive clash with Strasbourg tomorrow when judges rule on whether . Britain’s ‘life means life’ sentences for the country’s 47 worst . criminals are illegal.

Pop superstar Rihanna yesterday won a legal fight with Topshop after it used her face on a T-shirt without permission. The singer claimed the item damaged her image because fans may have thought it was genuine merchandise. Suing under her real name, Robyn Rihanna Fenty, she is asking for £3million damages from Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group Brands Ltd, which operates the clothing chain. Dispute: Rihanna has won a battle with Topshop over a T-shirt bearing the picture of her face, seen left, which she claimed is similar to one of her album covers and could mislead fans into believing the item was 'genuine' At London’s High Court, the judge Mr . Justice Birss said the white T-shirt with a photograph of the star in a . bra top was an act of ‘passing off’. ‘A substantial number of purchasers . are likely to [have been] deceived into buying [the] T-shirt because of a . false belief that it has been authorised by Rihanna,’ he said. The judge said it was damaging to her . goodwill and represented a loss of control over her reputation in the . ‘fashion sphere’. Damages will be decided later. The legal case against Topshop has . come as a surprise to some, given Rihanna’s apparent friendship with . Topshop tycoon Sir Philip. Big win: Rihanna in Los Angeles, California, on Tuesday night after eating in an Italian restaurant on the eve of her court victory in London yesterday . Decision: Justice Birss sitting at the High Court said Topshop's sale of a Rihanna T-shirt at the centre of the dispute was an act of 'passing off' The What’s My Name singer dined with . the businessman and music mogul Simon Cowell during her Christmas break . in Barbados in 2010. She later tweeted: ‘Just had dinner w/ Simon Cowell Philip Green @ Sandy Lane! Great night!’ Rihanna has also spent time with Sir . Philip’s daughter Chloe when they were on holiday at the same time in . the Caribbean two years ago. It was even rumoured the singer might follow in the footsteps of Kate Moss and design a range for Topshop. Topshop has in the past released a . T-shirt featuring a picture of Rihanna taken from the video for her hit . We Found Love, which sold out quickly. But despite the legal battle, the . star’s entourage have continued to ask Topshop for clothes on her . behalf, the court  was told. Requests came on ‘ten recent . occasions’, six of which were after Rihanna launched proceedings against . the retailer, said the company’s barrister, Geoffrey Hobbs QC. Dinner pals: Rihanna having a meal with Sir Philip Green and friends in Barbados on Boxing Day 2010 . Chat: Sir Philip's daughter Chloe sits with Rihanna on Barbados over Christmas 2011 . Claims: Topshop was selling a T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of Rihanna's face she claims is 'very similar' to one of her album covers . Ex-Formula One driver Eddie Irvine successfully sued Talksport over its use of a photo of him in an advert which suggested he endorsed the radio station . Celebrities cannot easily exert control over the use of their face but Rihanna's victory might encourage more to try, an expert has said. The singer successfully sued Topshop because she was able to convince the court it had created the impression the T-shirts had been endorsed by her. Michael Gardner, head of the intellectual property team at London law firm Wedlake Bell, said: 'A number of fans would have mistakenly believed she had entered into a commercial deal with the company to sell the clothing. 'Although it is fashionable to talk about image rights, there is in fact no such legal right in existence under English law. 'In other words, celebrities, sports personalities, film stars (or anyone else) cannot exert general control over the use of their likenesses. 'They can only act to prevent the unauthorised use of their image in a particular case if the type falls within another area of law that does provide protection. 'Examples are where they can use copyright law, the law of privacy or, as in the Rihanna case, ""passing off""'.

Pumping his fist in the air, he added: ‘Let’s fight for political power in the country.’ Riot police at the scene had earlier demanded the crowd disperse after a suspected bomb was discovered on a platform.

The 37-year-old man who ran away with a 15-year-old girl has been charged with sex abuse and faces life in prison, it was revealed today. Robert Messer befriended teenager Emily Lalinksy's mother, Lisa Schwartz, through their church in Plymouth Township, Michigan and had known the 15-year-old since she was a little girl. Today Lieutenant Cal Lauria told MailOnline: 'He has been charged on six counts. Count one, Criminal Sexual Conduct in the first degree, which carries life imprisonment. 'Counts two through five, Criminal Sexual Conduct in the third degree, each count carrying a 15 year penalty and Count six Accosting a Minor which carries a four years.' Scroll down for video . Besotted: Messer posted this picture of Emily on Instagram boasting 'Looks like someone knows a secret'. He is now facing six charges, the most severe of which carries a life sentence . Warning signs: Messer posted this montage on his Flickr page clearly setting out how smitten he was . Secret: Messer posted this picture of Emily on his Instagram account under #agapetos, which means 'beloved' in Greek . The Lieutenant said the charges . reflected the true severity of the crime and Messer's alleged betrayal of the . family. Emily's mother, stepfather, Neil Schwartz, and five siblings . were thrown into a panic of fear and uncertainty from the moment she . went missing on Sunday morning to the moment of her discovery in a field . in Michigan on Tuesday afternoon. Both she and Messer were badly . dehydrated and taken to separate hospitals where they received treatment . for this and for 'superficial self-inflicted wounds.' Emily remained in hospital . yesterday but Messer was taken into police custody and is now in Wayne . County Jail. Bail has been set at $2million. Lieutenant Lauria said: 'The public need to know this guy groomed her for years. She's in love with the guy. It's very sad.' Yesterday he said he was not authorized to comment on whether the wrist wounds found on both Emily and Messer were part of a suicide pact formed between the couple. Emily's mother is still reeling from the shocking disappearance on Sunday - completely unaware just how close the Messer, a family friend, had apparently got to her daughter. But a search online shows that Messer at least was becoming increasingly brazen in his show of devotion. On his Instagram account two months ago he posted a picture of Emily with the caption: 'Looks like someone knows a secret'. Found: Emily Lalinksy, pictured with Robert Messer, is staying in hospital for longer after they were found suffering from identical 'self-inflicted' wrist wounds . And alongside a picture of Emily posted three weeks ago in his account he wrote ‘agapetos’ a Greek word for ‘beloved.’ And . on his Flickr page he produced a montage of pictures of Emily with the . worrying caption: 'We have known each other for many days... but every . day with you has been a great day'. On Tuesday Emily’s family spoke of their relief and delight that the teenager had been found. Asked . by text whether she was pleased to have her daughter home, Emily’s . mother, Lisa Schwartz replied simply: ‘You betcha.’ She summed up the . ordeal as ‘every parent’s nightmare.’ Emily and Messer were found in a field in Washtenaw County, near 7 Mile and Chubbs Road in Northville. Their discovery brought to an end a search that began when Emily vanished from her home in Plymouth Township five days ago. During that time police had feared for her safety. Emily's mother had made public appeals for her safe return on television, during which she admitted: ‘I think once Bob realizes what he has done he might hurt himself and I don’t know where that would leave her.’ Speaking yesterday from the family home in a quiet Plymouth neighborhood Lisa’s husband, Neil said: ‘Lisa’s priority now is Emily and looking after her.’ Distress: Emily's mother, Lisa, and her new husband, Neil Schwartz, are delighted she is back home. Explanation: They left behind a letter explaining why they had run away and apologizing to their families . Desperate search: Police had been appealing to the public for help and received a number of tips that may have led them to the couple's hiding place . Both . Messer and the teenager left notes professing their love for each . other, with Emily asking her mother to try not to blame herself. Messer, recently divorced and father to a son, wrote: ‘We are in love and cannot be apart from each other. ‘This is sad to us but our love, though we’ve had to keep it a secret, has been the best part of our lives. Please be happy for us.’ In a heartfelt note to her mother, Emily wrote: ‘You are an amazing and wonderful mother and person. I’m so sorry I hurt you and if there was any other way we would’ve done it. ‘Try not to be sad and don’t blame yourself, nothing could be done.’ Messer had become a friend of Emily’s mother when they met at church. ‘I trusted him,’ Schwartz told ABC7 at the height of her search for her daughter. ‘My whole family trusted him. My daughter trusted him. Bob was always like a brother to me. ‘Emily doesn’t have a dad, so she always looked up to Bob as a dad, as a father figure. They’re both very introverted. They both love photography and they both love hiking.’ She said that far from feeling concern at Messer’s involvement in her teenage daughter’s life she had been grateful for the time he spent with her. She said: ‘With me having so many kids I could not just take her and do things with her, so he was like, “I’ll take her to Ann Arbor, I’ll take her to the Botanical Gardens.’","Robert Messer charged on six counts, with the most serious carrying a life sentence .

Climate change sceptics are often derided as uninformed - but a new study proves that the opposite is the case. Sceptical individuals are slightly MORE science literate than 'believers' in climate change. The difference isn't huge, according to a survey of 1500 U.S. adults. 57% of sceptics are 'science literate' according to tests asking basic science and maths questions, versus 56% of believers. Greenpeace activists: Sceptical individuals are slightly MORE science literate than 'believers' in climate change . Dan Kahan,  Professor of Psychology at Yale Law School said, 'Political controversy over climate change cannot be attributed to the public's limited ability to comprehend science.' he said. Researchers measured ‘science literacy’ with test items developed by the National Science Foundation. The questions were simple questions such as 'Electrons are smaller than atoms, true or false?' They also measured their subjects' ‘numeracy’—that is, their ability to understand quantitative information. The controversy comes down, in effect, to a conflict over values - and informed individuals are better at fitting the scientific facts, and gaps in our knowledge, to whatever they happen to believe in. The questions were simple questions such as 'Electrons are smaller than atoms, true or false?' In case you're puzzled, the electrons are on the outside . ‘In effect,’ Kahan said, ‘ordinary members of the public credit or dismiss scientific information on disputed issues based on whether the information strengthens or weakens their ties to others who share their values. 'At least among ordinary members of the public, individuals with higher science comprehension are even better at fitting the evidence to their group commitments.’ ‘More information can help solve the climate change conflict,’ Kahan said, ‘but that information has to do more than communicate the scientific evidence. It also has to create a climate of deliberations in which no group perceives that accepting any piece of evidence is akin to betrayal of their cultural group.’","57% of sceptics are science-literate vs 56% of believers .

Tragedy: Retired nurse Maggie Young died after an agency worker at her care home accidentally spilled tea over her and the wound became infected . An elderly pensioner died from an infected wound after an agency nurse spilled a piping hot cup of tea on her lap at a care home, an inquest heard today. Retired nurse Maggie Young, 72, was lying in her bed when an agency staff worker accidentally knocked the cup off the edge of her bedside table. She was rushed to hospital four days after the spill as a doctor feared she may have developed the potentially fatal blood infection septicaemia. The stench coming from the infection was so bad that medics were forced to clear the ward at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth of other patients, the inquest heard. Doctors were unable to operate because of her frail condition, and she died two days later on June 20, Portsmouth Coroner's Court heard. The mother-of-three, who was a retired geriatric nurse, was in poor health after surviving ovarian, skin, and breast cancer. She had two knee replacements and suffered from arthritis. She was admitted to Beechcroft Manor nursing home in Gosport, Hampshire, in May last year after suffering a fall in her bedroom. Her widowed husband today admitted his wife of 55 years was nearing the end of her life but claimed the tea spillage was the 'pushing point' which killed her. Peter Young, 83, told the coroner he visited his wife most days and became concerned after an agency worker told him about the accident on June 13 last year. He said: 'The pushing point was the tea accident. It was the point she started deteriorating. It took an affect straight away. 'I went to the Matron the following day and she said ""oh it’s not that serious. There’s been a report but it’s nothing to worry about"" and I believed her.' It was not until the couple’s daughter Janet discovered the extent of the wound a few days later that Mrs Young was rushed into hospital at night on June 17. Miss Young cried as she recalled the moment she discovered her mum suffering in bed at the care home. She said: 'Mum was moaning and groaning like nothing on Earth. 'I pulled a side chair up and pulled her hand away because I wanted to kiss her and I saw her nightie and dressing gown was sticking to her. 'There was a sticking great black mess underneath. It was seeping. I was horrified. I saw it didn’t have a dressing on it. 'I went to see one of the nurses and she said it was just part of her dying and I would have to accept that. Care home: Mrs Young's family claimed staff at Beechcroft Manor in Hampshire told them the tea incident was 'nothing to worry about' and it was only when her daughter insisted on a doctor that she was taken to hospital . 'It was quite shocking. I was not aware of the wound at the time. It was quite horrendous.' The inquest heard nursing staff were . reluctant to call an ambulance because Mrs Young had signed a document . declaring that she did not wish to be taken into hospital. But her daughter insisted urgent medical care was needed and calls were made for a doctor. She . said: 'The doctor came and had a good look. He said she had possible . septicemia and he said ""we have to get her to hospital straightaway"". 'They (the nurses) said to me she didn’t want to go in, but in my mind I couldn’t imagine her saying that at the time. I just wanted to get her into hospital.' When they arrived at the hospital, Ms Young told how staff had to clear the ward because of the stench from her mother's wound. She said: 'The smell was quite horrendous. We were in a corner of the ward. The doctors came out and they were actually quite shocked by the stench and by the wound - the gangrene or whatever it was. 'A surgeon came down and said there was no way of operating because she wouldn’t make it. She went in to her own room and that’s where I stayed for four days and watched her die.' Miss Young expressed her 'frustration' with the care home staff, adding: 'I want to know what happened. Why did she have to go like that?' The pathologist who performed a post-mortem examination on Mrs Young’s body concluded she died of sepsis from the abdominal wound. Too late for treatment: Mrs Young was rushed to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth four days after the tea incident but was too frail for doctors to operate. She died two days later . Dr Judith O’Higgins said a secondary cause of death could have been a combination of Mrs Young’s many ailments, which included heart disease, fibrosis of the lungs, fatty change in the liver and 'extreme inflammation' of the kidneys. The pathologist agreed the sepsis could have been caused by the tea burns, adding: 'It’s basically an overwhelming infection. The body cannot confine the infection to one area. The infection goes everywhere in the body and the body cannot cope with this infection any longer. 'Eventually there’s what we call multiple organ failure. One by one, all the organs develop malfunctions. It’s very quick.' She added: 'It looks to me there was a massive deterioration in a very short space of time. There were multiple pre-existing conditions in this case which accelerated this.' The inquest heard that police investigated Beechcroft Manor, which specialises in caring for terminal ill patients, but found there was no case to answer. However, Detective Inspector Scott MacKechine told the inquest he had raised concerns that no accident form was filled out at the time of the tea spillage. Lincoln Brookes, representing Beechcroft Manor, said staff and medics were not sure if the wound was caused by a spill or an existing infection. Mr Brookes said: 'The nursing home do not know how she got a scald on her. They are treating it as a red patch that started on her stomach. 'They got a doctor straight away. They could not tell at that stage whether it was a scald or an infection.' No cause of death or verdict has yet been given. The hearing continues and is expected to last four days.","Maggie Young, 72, was in bed at Beechcroft Manor Care home in Hampshire .

Challenging African youth . to seize a 'moment of great promise', Obama declared that the future of . the young and growing continent still rests in ailing South African . leader Mandela's vision for equality and opportunity. Inspiration: Obama delivers a speech on US - African relations and the younger generation at the University of Cape Town and spoke of Nelson Mandela's enduring influence on the world . Making friends: Obama greets members of the audience after delivering African policy remarks at the University of Cape Town . Seeking . to carve out his own piece of that legacy, Obama unveiled an ambitious . initiative to double electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa, vowing to . bring 'light where there is darkness'. In the flagship address of his weeklong trip to Africa, Obama outlined a U.S. policy toward the continent that focuses on increasing the region's ability to support itself economically, politically and militarily. Harkening back to a prominent theme from his 2009 speech in Ghana - Obama's only other trip to Africa as president - he said Africans must take much of the responsibility for achieving that goal, although he pledged American assistance. 'Ultimately I believe Africans should make up their own minds about what serves African interests,' he said. 'We trust your judgment, the judgment of ordinary people. We believe that when you control your destiny, if you got a handle on your governments, then governments will promote freedom and opportunity, because that will serve you.' Obama's address came nearly 50 years after Robert F. Kennedy delivered his famous speech at the same university. Kennedy's speech, delivered soon after Mandela was sentenced to life in prison, called on young people to launch a fight against injustice, creating ripples of hope that would 'build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance'. Respect: Obama supports former Robben Island Prison inmate and now tour guide Ahmed Kathrada (right) as they visit Nelson Mandela's cell . Humbled: President Obama and the First Lady visit Nelson Mandela's cell in the Robben Island prison off Cape Town, South Africa . Much has changed in South Africa since Kennedy addressed the nation. The apartheid regime crumbled under intense internal and external pressure. Mandela was elected as his country's first black president following his release from prison. And South Africa has rapidly become continent's economic and political powerhouse. But Obama said that progress, in South Africa and elsewhere on the continent, rests on a 'fragile foundation'. In order to solidify the gains, Obama called on Africans to focus on three priorities: expanding opportunity, promoting democracy and supporting peace. A cornerstone of Obama's efforts to expand opportunity is the new Power Africa initiative unveiled ahead of his speech. The venture is supported by $7 billion in U.S. investment and $9 billion from the private sector, and will seek to bring electricity to at least 20 million new households and commercial entities in an initial set of six countries: Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria and Tanzania. The White House did not set a specific deadline for achieving that goal, but Obama advisers said it could happen within a decade. However, the first round of contributions still fall well short of the $300 billion the International Energy Agency says would be required to achieve universal electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030. Obama opened his speech with deeply personal remarks about Mandela, tracing the anti-apartheid icon's influence on his own political activism to his young daughters. He said that standing in Mandela's cell alongside Malia and Sasha made the experience all the more poignant, reflecting on the distinction he shares with Mandela in being his country's first black president. 'Seeing them stand within the walls that once surrounded Nelson Mandela, I knew this was an experience they would never forget,' he said. 'I knew they now appreciated a little bit more that Madiba and other had made for freedom,' Obama added, referring to Mandela by his clan name. Obama arrived in Cape Town on Sunday from Johannesburg, where he met privately with members of Mandela's family and spoke with the former president's wife. In keeping with the family's wishes, Obama did not visit Mandela in the hospital. On a sunny winter day in the Southern Hemisphere, Obama and his family flew by helicopter to Robben Island, the prison that epitomized the struggle of Mandela and his contemporaries against apartheid rule. The Obamas were led through the island by Ahmed Kathrada, an 83-year-old former prisoner who was held alongside Mandela and had also given Obama a tour of the jail when he visited as a U.S. senator in 2006. The Obamas solemnly peered across the bright white lime quarry where Mandela worked each day. They spent 20 minutes inside the tiny cell where Mandela spent nearly two decades of his life, all the while inspiring the anti-apartheid movement on mainland South Africa. Before closing their visit, Obama and wife Michelle stoically entered a prison courtyard, the president's hand on the small of the first lady's back, to sign a guestbook. 'On behalf of our family we're deeply humbled to stand where men of such courage faced down injustice and refused to yield,' Obama wrote. 'The world is grateful for the heroes of Robben Island, who remind us that no shackles or cells can match the strength of the human spirit.'","Aviwe Mtongana, 15, performed his song Hell On Earth for the President at the Cape Town center ."

Jack was with a friend at his local shopping centre when the guards moved in to remove the four men who were celebrating after one avoided a jail sentence at a court hearing earlier that day. The fight broke out after the group were asked to leave because they were drunk and causing a nuisance. In total four security guards faced off against the gang of four men in full view of stunned shoppers. Dozens of adults gathered to watch the  spectacle, but only Jack jumped in to help. During the fight one security guard had his shirt ripped off others were kicked, punched and head butted. One was even bitten.

"PUBLISHED: . 10:40 EST, 28 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:40 EST, 28 August 2013 . Increased awareness of SAD is causing many to incorrectly self-diagnose . Seasonal affective disorder - known as SAD - is a rare phenomenon that has been exaggerated, claims a new report. A study of almost 800 people has shown neither time of year nor weather conditions greatly influence depressive symptoms in the majority of people. Researchers believe the power of the ‘winter blues’ has been over-egged because of awareness of SAD - and a general dislike of the cold. Dr David Kerr, of Oregon State University in the United States, said: 'We may not have as much fun, we can feel cooped up and we may be less active in the winter. 'But that’s not the same as long-lasting sadness hopelessness, and problems with appetite and sleep - real signs of clinical depression.' His team compared data from U.S. citizens who completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms multiple times over a period of years with local weather conditions - including sunlight intensity. Some 92 per cent of participants reported seasonal changes in mood and behaviour and 27 per cent said these were a problem. However, Dr Jeff Shaman, of Columbia University, said: 'We found a very small effect during the winter months - but it was much more modest than would be expected if seasonal depression were as common as many people think it is. 'We were surprised. With a sample of nearly 800 people and very precise measures of the weather we expected to see a larger effect.' The study, published online by the Journal of Affective Disorders, concluded getting depressed when it’s cold and dreary outside may not be as common as is often believed. Dr Kerr said his findings do not rule out the existence of clinically diagnosed SAD but shows people may be overestimating the impact seasons have on depression in the general population. Many SAD sufferers use UV lamps during the winter months, believing that it can help lift their mood . He said: 'It’s clear from prior research SAD exists. But our research suggests what we often think of as the winter blues does not affect people nearly as much as we may think.' Dr Kerr believes the misunderstanding could have arisen by most studies of seasonal depression asking people to look back on their feelings over time. He said: 'People are really good at remembering certain events and information. 'But unfortunately we probably can’t accurately recall the timing of day-to-day emotions and symptoms across decades of our lives. These research methods are a problem.” Dr Kerr said people who believe they have SAD should get help. He said clinical trials show cognitive behaviour therapy, anti-depressants and light box therapy can all help relieve both depression and SAD. He said: 'Fortunately there are many effective treatments for depression - whether or not it is seasonal. Cognitive behaviour therapy stands out because it has been shown to keep SAD from returning the next year.'","Research has shown that neither the time of year nor weather conditions influence depressive symptoms greatly in the majority of people .

They say we all eventually turn in to our parents but there are some things we'd rather not inherit. Prince Harry, it seems, has begun to lose some hair around his crown, just like his big brother William and their father Charles. The 28-year-old royal's hair shows signs of thinning in pictures taken on a recent charity trip. Rapidly thinning: Prince Harry's hair was noticeably thinner as he played with children on a visit in February to Lesotho in southern Africa on behalf of his charity, Sentebale . Pictured during a visit to . the Kananelo Centre for the deaf on behalf of his charity, Sentebale, in Lesotho, last month Harry was showing some scalp through his famous ginger locks - indicating the beginnings of male pattern baldness, according to Britain's leading hair loss expert Asim Shahmalak. Prince William started losing his hair in his early 20s and was noticeably bald by the time he was 25. The process appears to have started a . little later for his younger brother Harry, who nevertheless looks to . have inherited his family's baldness gene. Hair transplant surgeon Dr Shahmalak - hair loss expert on the Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies - said the pictures showed clear signs of hair loss. and that Harry is thinning around the crown area. Disappearing: The 28-year-old royal's hair loss was more pronounced than ever in Lesotho last month . 'Around a quarter of men start going . bald before the age of 30, so this is hardly a big surprise especially . when it runs in the family as it does for the Windsors. 'If Harry's hair loss progresses in . the normal way, I would expect him to have a significant bald patch . around his crown by the time he is 40. It will be worse if it also . spreads to his hairline as it has with his brother.' he said. 'Hair loss can have a devastating impact on a young men like Harry. IIt can shatter their confidence and lead to significant loss of self esteem.' Dr Shahmalak said that a strong family gene is the most significant factor in the onset of hair loss. Like father, like son: Prince Harry at the Queen's Jubilee last year with Prince Charles, left, who is also suffering from thinning hair. 'There is a strong family gene on both sides of Harry's family,' hair specialist Dr Shahmalak said . Hair envy: Prince Harry admiring a full head of hair as he met a child in Lesotho . Prince . Harry's father, Prince Charles, his grandfather Prince Philip and both . his uncles, Princes Andrew and Edward, have significant hair loss. And the gene is prominent on his mother's side, too: Princess Diana's father Earl Spencer was bald. Dr . Shahmalak said: 'There is a strong family gene on both sides of Harry's . family. He is lucky that it has kicked in a bit later than his brother . William - but the signs are not good for Harry.' But he said there were simple measures Harry could take to combat his hair loss. 'I would strongly urge him to act now,' said Dr Shahmalak. Going, going, gone: Prince William started losing his hair in his early 20s and was noticeably bald by the time he was 25 . Family problem: Prince Harry's hair was showing clear signs of a growing bald patch at Prince William's wedding in 2011 . 'The . best remedy at this stage is for Harry to start taking Propecia which . won't replace the hair which he has already lost but will help to stop . him losing any more. If William had started using the drug at the same . age he could have significantly slowed down his hair loss. 'The other solution would be for Harry to use Minoxidil, the only other clinically proven hair loss medication available. 'You can buy a mousse which you apply to the thinning areas of the scalp. 'But . the only long-term solution is a hair transplant - where hair is moved . from the back or sides of the scalp to bald areas such as the crown.' Dr . Shahmalak said the stigma around seeking treatment for hair loss had . largely gone, thanks to high profile hair transplant patients like Wayne . Rooney and James Nesbitt. Expert: Dr Shahmalak runs the Crown Cosma hair loss clinic in Manchester . He said: 'Wayne Rooney was brave to go public about his hair transplant and show that he was not embarrassed to seek help for his hair loss. 'The stigma around seeking treatment has been removed. It would send out a great signal to other men if a royal would also seek treatment. 'Their options in covering up their . baldness are limited. It would be difficult for Prince William, for . instance, to shave his head, which is what a lot of men do to hide their . baldness. A royal with a crew cut just doesn’t seem right somehow.' Prince . Harry - recently voted the World's Most Eligible Bachelor in a magazine . poll - once joked that Prince William was 'already bald aged 12.' Harry also made fun of Prince William's baldness when commenting about artist Nicky Phillips’ portrait of the princes three years ago. He said said: 'I'm a little bit more ginger in there than I am in real life, I think,' he said, 'And William has been given more hair.' On Prince Harry's charity trip to Lesotho, Africa, in  February he met children at a charity on the trip who were urged to teach the young royal the sign language for 'ginger.' Harry quickly replied: 'What about the word for bald!' Dr Shahmalak said hair loss before the age of 30 can shatter a man's confidence, particularly around the opposite sex. He said: 'It can be devastating for a lot of men but I am not sure that will be a problem for Harry. 'He has is a very charismatic young man and has always attracted the attention of beautiful women.' Harry is currently dating the socialite Cressida Bonas, 24, after they were introduced  by her friend Princess Eugenie at a music festival last May. Dr Shahmalak's Crown Clinic saw a 25 per cent surge in bookings after Wayne Rooney's transplant. He has performed hair transplants on a number of celebrities including Dr Christian Jessen from Embarrassing Bodies and Martin Roberts, star of BBC1's Homes Under The Hammer.","Harry, 28, shows signs of hair thinning on a recent charity trip to Lesotho .

You never think it could happen to you — but fraudsters scam trusting investors out of more than £1.2billion every year. From cold-calling chancers flogging non-existent shares to smooth-talking salesmen convincing you to plough thousands of pounds into dodgy property schemes, criminals never miss an opportunity to tap into an age-old instinct — the desire to get rich quickly. The financial losses to individuals can be huge — anywhere between £10,000 to as much as £1 million, according to Action Fraud, the national fraud and internet crime centre. Fraudsters scam trusting investors out of more than £1.2 billion every year. One of the tricks involves cold-calling chancers flogging non-existent shares (file photo) Often the scams start small, asking for as little as £500 of your cash just to ‘see how it goes’. Then, after fictitious updates suggesting explosive profits and huge gains, duped investors hand over even greater sums. Only when promised returns fail to materialise does the penny drop. The personal impact of fraud can hit victims even harder than the financial blow. Many are too embarrassed to tell anyone, and suffer stress from worrying about the fallout. It’s estimated that nine in ten cases go unreported, according to the City regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA). But the heartbreak and financial headaches can be avoided. Never give out any personal information — especially not your bank details — to any individual or company over the phone before you’ve checked their credentials. After fictitious updates suggesting explosive profits and huge gains, duped investors hand over greater sums. Only when promised returns fail to materialise does the penny drop (file photo) Be especially wary of post, phone calls or emails offering you business deals out of the blue. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Always question it. You can report a scam and get advice about protecting yourself by calling Action Fraud, the national crime centre backed by the Government on 0300 123 2040. To help alert you, here are three of the biggest investment frauds: . PLOTS OF LAND YOU CAN NEVER SELL ON . An increasingly common scam is run by conmen who buy a huge plot of land and slice it up into smaller plots, which they sell on to individual investors. The idea is that investors are snapping up wonderful real estate that will increase in value and be sold at a substantial profit. Investors are convinced to buy without even seeing the plot or conducting a survey. But in reality the plots generally can’t be built on — instead, they might be sites of historic or natural interest or, in one example, include a 45-degree slope with no access. In some cases, the land does not even exist. The FSA estimates investors have lost £200 million to these so-called ‘land-banking’ scams. Angela Crossley, head of investigations at the Insolvency Service, says: ‘Companies deliberately mislead the public and ruin the lives of honest people. ‘Our investigators are tracking down these con artists and stopping them from trading, but new firms pop up immediately offering the same false investment opportunities.’ CARBON CREDITS THAT ARE JUST THIN AIR . One of the latest cons is run by dodgy salesmen who promise huge returns from investing in green schemes, known as carbon credits. The idea is that ordinary investors will be able to profit from companies that have to be more environmentally friendly to keep down pollution. These types of firms need to buy carbon credits — essentially certificates giving them permission to pump one ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Because all companies have targets for the amount of carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit, the big polluters need to buy carbon credits to offset the extra they create. The carbon credit certificates are generated by companies that use less than their allowance  or are particularly environmentally friendly. Potential investors are lured by reports that trading carbon credits may become increasingly profitable in future years. As more companies will need to offset the pollution they cause,  so the value of the carbon credits will go up. But carbon credit schemes are essentially buying nothing but thin air — there is nothing tangible to invest in. Though there are plenty of legitimate companies offering access to such schemes, many others are fraudulent and trying their luck with cold calls — and promises of windfalls. The FSA is worried about the promise of returns and is sceptical that anyone has ever made money. Jonathan Phelan, head of unauthorised business at the FSA, says: ‘We have yet to see any convincing evidence to indicate that investors can make money from investing in carbon credits.’ So far, the regulator has launched 77 inquiries into carbon credit firms and recently added a further 13 to its warning list. BOILER ROOMS THAT SELL FAKE SHARES . Despite continued crackdowns, huge numbers of investors still lose money to so-called boiler room scams. With these, a person is called at home by a salesman and persuaded to buy shares in a company. They are told that the firm, which is often based overseas and has a professional-sounding name, is about to make huge profits. This could be because they are about to list on a stock exchange, be bought out by a bigger company or, in the case of engineering firms, have just discovered oil or another mineral deposit somewhere around the globe. The fake stockbroker — who is usually calling from another country — then pressures you into making a quick decision to avoid missing out on the deal. But, in reality, what you are  buying are shares in small firms which are difficult to sell or sometimes don’t even exist. The returns never appear and once you start to ask questions, the brokers will suddenly stop returning your calls. Mike and Susan Denny, pictured, were nearly duped by a pushy cold-caller representing a carbon credit firm . Retiree Mike Denny had a narrow . escape when he nearly handed over £2,500 of his hard-earned cash to a . pushy cold-caller representing a carbon credit firm. Mr Denny (pictured with his wife Susan) was shocked at how much the salesman, called Oliver, seemed to know about him. ‘I have no idea how he got hold of my . number and details. He knew I had enough money to invest and that I had . solar panels on my roof so was obviously interested in green issues.’ ‘Oliver’ told Mr Denny that if he sent . a cheque for £2,500 he could ‘get in on the ground floor of an exciting . investment’ and earn back eight times that in just two years. Oliver said the money would buy him . carbon credits that other companies would need in the future to offset . their carbon footprint. There would even be an opportunity to invest . more down the line. Mr Denny, who lives in Manchester, said the exaggerated return was a red flag for him. But after he said he wasn’t interested, Oliver still called back and even tried to go through Mrs Denny, a retired NHS worker.","Fraudsters scam trusting investors out of more than £1.2billion every year .

Now Judge Peter Bowers has sparked outcry again – this time for letting off a sex offender after deciding his crime was ‘water under the bridge’. The controversial judge allowed predatory Gary Flynn, 35, to walk free from court despite hearing that he had forced an underage girl into oral sex. Judge Peter Bowers said because Gary Flynn assaulted the girl 15 years ago, it was 'water under the bridge' Flynn, a bouncer, admitted carrying out the attack more than 15 years ago after the traumatised victim spoke to police. He has previously been cautioned for a similar offence, the court was told. But in a move that has outraged . campaigners, Judge Bowers spared him jail because he was between 16 and . 18 years old when the incident took place. Flynn was also suffering from a head injury at the time, which the judge said may have clouded his judgement. Judge Bowers said: ‘You were a teenager suffering from the effects of a head injury which made your maturity and responsibility less than somebody of your age. ‘This is water under the bridge. You have lived 15 or 17 years without other convictions and there is no reason to think you will be committing offences in the future.’ Judge Bowers gave Flynn a three year community supervision order at Teeside Crown Court (pictured) This is just the latest in a string of . controversial rulings by Judge Bowers, who last year praised the . ‘courage’ of burglar Richard Rochford and let him off with a suspended . sentence. He told him: ‘It . takes a huge amount of courage, as far as I can see, for somebody to . burgle somebody’s house. I wouldn’t have the nerve.’ He was criticised for his choice of words, which were branded a ‘serious error of judgment’. Following an investigation, the . Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling and Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge upheld . complaints about the comments and issued Judge Bowers with a reprimand . for his remarks which had ‘damaged public con-fidence in the judicial . process’. Then in April, . Judge Bowers sparked anger again when he let paedophile Mark Martin skip . jail because he thought he ‘would suffer very badly’ in prison. Judge Bowers previously reprimanded for saying burglar Richard Rochford (pictured) had 'courage' In the latest case at Teesside Crown Court on Friday, Judge Bowers heard that Flynn indecently assaulted his victim, who cannot be named, in the late 1990s. Flynn pleaded guilty to one count of indecent assault on a child under 16 after admitting he groped the younger girl between the legs and forced her to have oral sex. Judge Bowers praised him for pleading guilty and sparing his victim the ordeal of giving evidence before handing him a three year community supervision order. Flynn, of Norton, County Durham, was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register. Yesterday, as he had Sunday lunch with his mother, Flynn was unrepentant when asked about the judge’s soft ruling. He said: ‘I’ve got nothing to say. I only pleaded guilty so that I could stay out of prison.’ Speaking after the case, Dilys Davy, of sex abuse charity ARCH, said: ‘It might be water under the bridge for him but not for his victim, she has to live with it for the rest of her life. ‘His comments are outrageous. It’s as though he is saying that because it happened a long time ago, no harm done. ‘This kind of thing can discourage victims from coming forward. A judge’s comments are important and the main reason people say they do not report abuse is the fear that they will not be taken seriously or won’t be believed.’ David Hines, of the National Victims Association charity, said: ‘It’s a disgrace. What a stupid thing for a judge to say. How can it be water under the bridge for the victim? ‘There can’t ever be water under the bridge for the victim before justice is done. ‘And it’s secondary victimization for them to have to see an offender walk free from court.’","Gary Flynn was given three year community supervision order .

Swaddling may have come back into fashion, particularly after speculation over how Prince George appeared to be wrapped as he left hospital. But the centuries-old practice could damage a baby’s hips, a British surgeon warns. Swaddling has become popular again because of its perceived calming effect, after falling out of favour following concern that it could overheat the baby and restrict growth. Swaddling may have come back into fashion after speculation Prince George was wrapped as he left hospital . Demand for swaddling clothes has soared by almost two-thirds in the UK in recent years and has been fuelled recently by the first pictures of Prince George in his mother’s arms – although there is no evidence he was fully swaddled. In the US, nine in ten babies are swaddled in the first six months. But Professor Nicholas Clarke of Southampton University Hospital says there is growing evidence that it can lead to hip abnormalities. Professor Clarke, a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon, said binding or bundling babies in blankets with the arms restrained and the lower limbs extended may force the hips to straighten and shift forward, risking misalignment which could lead to osteoarthritis and hip replacement in middle age, or even dislocation. In Japan a programme to encourage grandmothers not to swaddle their grandchildren has halved the rate of hip dislocation. One baby in five is born with a hip abnormality but factors after birth also have a role and swaddling may delay improvement, Professor Clarke said in the Archives of Disease in Childhood. He said swaddling can be safe if it does not stop the baby’s legs from bending up and out at the hips, because this position allows for natural development of the hip joints. Demand for swaddling clothes has soared by almost two-thirds in the UK in recent years and has been fuelled recently by the first pictures of Prince George in his mother's arms . ‘Commercial products for swaddling should have a loose pouch or sack for the babies’ legs and feet, allowing plenty of hip movement,’ he said, adding that healthcare professionals need to give mothers advice about how to swaddle their children safely, so their legs are not tightly wrapped and pressed together. Jane Munro of the Royal College of Midwives said: ‘There are concerns about the growing use of swaddling because of the possibility of overheating the baby, and the increased risk of cot death. Also, as this research suggests, swaddling, and especially tight swaddling, may affect the baby’s natural posture. ‘We advise parents to avoid swaddling, but it is also crucial that we take into account each mother’s cultural background.’ Andreas Roposch, from Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: ‘Swaddling should not be employed in my view.’ Dr Alastair Sutcliffe of the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said: ‘I would advise that if a baby needs to be wrapped up to get off to sleep that parents do this in a sympathetic and loose manner and not tight, especially around the baby’s hips.’","Swaddling is said to have come back into fashion, particularly after speculation Prince George appeared to be wrapped as he left hospital .

With a supermodel daughter, it is natural to assume that Valerie Campbell would be as looks-obsessed as the modelling industry. Yet when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in her right breast and underwent a mastectomy, Valerie, 61, decided against the reconstructive surgery that might have maintained her perfect figure. 'After what I’d been through, my looks weren’t important,’ says Valerie, who lives in Surrey. 'When you’re staring into the chasm between life and death, you put things into perspective and whether I was left with one arm, one eye or one breast, staying alive was what mattered. Glamorous: Naomi Campbell and mother Valerie after the latter's operation . 'I didn’t have concerns about reconstructive surgery - that’s not why I turned it down - but it was unnecessary to me; my legs are more important to how I feel about my appearance than my breasts - and it wasn’t worth the risk, or physical trauma. Besides, I’m scared of needles.’ Eight years after Valerie’s diagnosis, she has no regrets - although friends and family are still surprised by it. 'Even now Naomi rings me up and says, “Mum, why don’t you have a reconstruction?”. I think my daughter worries that’s the reason I’m on my own, that maybe I’m scared of intimacy. But it couldn’t be further from the truth. 'I can live without my breast. It hasn’t changed my character or affected my body image. I still wear low-cut tops and swimming costumes - I use prosthetics. If I’m not bothered about what my chest looks like, why should a man? If someone comes along who’s right for me, he won’t care.’ Valerie is not alone in deciding against reconstructive surgery after mastectomy. Around 17,000 women a year have a mastectomy, but only a quarter have reconstructive surgery, according to the National Mastectomy and Breast Reconstruction Audit of England and Wales published last year. The majority of reconstructions are performed at the same time as surgery to remove the cancer. Women who wait often want time to accept their diagnosis and its impact on their self-image. Mother-daughter duo (pictured in 1992): 'You don't argue with Naomi,' laughs Valerie about her daughter's insistence she be seen by a specialist in the U.S. But most breast cancer patients never have a reconstruction. 'In specialist centres that offer reconstruction routinely and have access to highly trained surgeons, only about 40 to 50 per cent of women have one,’ says Fiona MacNeill, consultant breast surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital, West London. Ms MacNeill says that women often find their daughters are the ones encouraging them to have reconstructions. 'The daughters are usually transferring feelings about their own self-image - they’re sure they would choose one so think it must be right for their mother,’ says Ms MacNeill. 'Women have different relationships with their breasts throughout their lives. A lot of older women, particularly mothers, see their breasts as functional and now they’ve served their purpose are less affected by their loss, while younger women are more likely to have reconstructions.’ A reconstruction is major surgery and can take three months to recover from, which also puts women off, she adds. 'Their breasts are never going to look, feel or have the same sensation as before treatment. Some patients take pride in their scars and see them as a sign of winning a battle.’ Others may see their breasts as a threat that could potentially kill them, so are not concerned about losing them. 'If I’m not bothered about what my chest . looks like, why should a man? If someone comes along who’s right for me, . he won’t care.’ 'As long as they’re fully informed about options, women tend to make the best decisions for themselves,’ adds Ms MacNeill. Therein lies a problem, as many women are not fully informed about their options, says Joe O’Donoghue, plastic surgeon and British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons member, who co-authored the audit. Lack of awareness of the options and access to specialist plastic surgeons play a significant role in the low rates of reconstructions. The audit found more than a third of women surveyed said the risks and benefits of reconstruction were never discussed. Options include an implant-based reconstruction, or a tissue reconstruction that involves skin, fat and muscle grafting. Reconstructive surgery is not risk-free - 35 five per cent of women who have implant reconstructions undergo a 'revision’ operation within five years due to problems, including capsular contracture (when tissue forms around the implant, causing hardness and pain) - or asymmetry. 'The surviving breast will naturally age, while the implant hasn’t,’ explains Mr O’Donoghue. This problem is avoided with a tissue reconstruction as the breast ages the same way as the other breast and changes size, but the surgery is longer, more complex, and leaves scars. Valerie had an advanced invasive ductal carcinoma - cancer affecting the cells lining the milk ducts. She had felt a lump while bathing and was soon referred to the Mayday Hospital in Croydon, Surrey. She was given a biopsy and then the shocking news that she had cancer, and it had spread to her lymph nodes. Like daughter, like mother: Valerie, pictured on the catwalk, joins many other women in refusing reconstructive surgery . 'My younger sister, Yvonne, who came with me to get the diagnosis, was bawling her eyes out, but it felt like the doctor was talking to someone else. All I heard was “cancer” and “advanced”.’ Delivering the news to her children Pierre, then 21 and training to be an actor in New York, and Naomi, then 35, who was working in Europe, was emotional. 'Everyone cried but me - I was shell-shocked.’ But Valerie remained positive. 'I said to Naomi: “Wherever this has come from, it’s going right back,” and she said she knew I’d be fine.’ Naomi insisted Valerie got a second opinion from a specialist in the U.S. 'You don’t argue with Naomi,’ Valerie laughs. Valerie, who by now had been referred to the Royal Marsden, immediately started chemotherapy to shrink the tumour, before doctors decided that Valerie should have a mastectomy. Valerie was also seeing specialists at the Mayo Clinic Cancer Centre in the U.S. and she opted to have the surgery - removing her breast and affected lymph nodes - there. 'Naomi arranged an apartment for me near the Mayo Clinic while I recuperated.’ Valerie stayed there for three months while undergoing radiotherapy. Back in the UK, Valerie started hormone therapy with the drug anastrozole, which stops the production of oestrogen and cuts the risk of breast cancer recurring. Valerie took anastrozole for seven years, but stopped because of the side-effects. 'It made me so puffy I couldn’t see my cheekbones, I was bloated, tired, moody, had pins and needles - you name it.’ Her regular check-ups ended after five years, and she now has the three-yearly mammograms that are offered by the NHS. 'I’ve been free of cancer so long I don’t think about it any more. Now I see and appreciate the detail in life, as if someone’s turned up the colour. I’ve found myself again and I want other women going through it to know that’s possible - with or without your breasts.’ Valerie Campbell is working on a natural skincare line with Perfect Look & Health products, which will donate 20 per cent of profits from sales of products during October to breast cancer research: lookandhealth.co.uk .","'I can live without my breast,' says Valerie - and so can many others .

Well, bad news - eating in front of the TV can make you fat. A new report finds that turning off the television and sharing meals as a family sat around the dining table can make families healthier. The dining environment itself is an influencer of weight, according to a recent study by Dr Brian Wansink, of Cornell University in the U.S. and Dr Ellen van Kleef of Wageningen University in the Netherlands. Weight watchers: Families who eat while watching TV are more likely to be fat new research has shown . The research examined the relationship between everyday family dinner rituals and the body mass index (BMI) of 190 parents and 148 children. The BMI is a measure of body fat that compares weight to height. Parents participating in the study completed a questionnaire regarding the whole family's mealtime habits. They were asked a broad range of questions concerning how many days they engage in mealtime activities, such as discussing their day, during a typical week. After filling in the questionnaire, the weight and height of both parents and children were recorded. Eating at the table in the dining room or kitchen was linked to lower BMIs for both children and parents.. File picture . These 'dinner rituals' correlated with both the parents and the child's BMIs. The higher the BMI of parents, the more frequent they indicated to eat with the TV on. Eating at the table in the dining room or kitchen was linked to lower BMIs for both children and parents. Girls who helped parents prepare dinner were more likely to have a higher BMI, but there is no such relationship among boys. Yet boys who had a more social dinner experience tended to have lower BMI, especially in families where everyone stayed at the table until everyone finished eating. This proved true in parents as well. The link between BMI and these dinner-time habits does not necessarily mean that one thing leads directly to another. The study said: 'What is important, however, is that these results underline the importance of the social aspect of sharing a meal as a family on BMI, since watching television, for example, correlated with higher BMI in the parents. These interactions may replace overeating with stronger, more positive feelings. 'Although the reasons for the links are not clear, family meals and their rituals may be an under-appreciated battleground to prevent obesity. Where one eats and how long one eats seems to be a driver of the weight one gains. 'Such behavior may be related to less distracted eating or more supervision. If you want to strengthen your family ties and, at the same time keep a slimmer figure, consider engaging in a more interactive dinner experience. 'A good place to start would be to eat together with the television off and then asking the kids to list their highlights of the day. After all, the dinner table does not just have to be a place where food gets eaten!'","Research shows link between eating and watching TV and higher BMI .

Squid fishermen have been blamed for the vicious slaughter of four sea lions found washed up on Malilbu beaches with gunshot wounds in the last two months. While investigators are hunting the culprits, wildlife rescue workers say squid fishermen trying to keep sea lions away from their boats at night are responsible. Fishermen are allowed to use special firecrackers to ward off the mammals, but shooting them is illegal. Shocking: This is one of four sea lions found with fatal gunshot wounds on a Malibu beach . Finger pointing: Wildlife rescuers have blamed squid fishermen for shooting dead four protected sea lions, including this one. The arrows show where this mammal was shot . California Wildfire Center's Jonsie Ross told CBSLA.com sea lion shootings happen every year in October when squid fishing season begins. 'When the fishing season starts, October 1, yeah, we actually have documented more sea lion shootings,' she said. The process to attract the squid to the surface of the water, which involves switching on a light, also attracts sea lions. The coast off Malibu is a popular area for squid fishing. However the squid fishing industry has denied the accusations. 'I called several fisherman. They knew nothing,' California Wetfish Producers Association executive director Diane . Pleschner-Steele said. 'They didn’t know who had done it. We don’t condone it. It’s illegal to . shoot for any reason.' Sea lions are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and anyone found harming them could be fined $10,000 and spend up to a year behind bars. Devastating: Investigators are trying to work out who was behind the murder of four sea lions, including this one . NBC reported the first sea lion - a male yearling - was found on August 1 at Pirate’s Cove near Zuma Beach. A bullet was found in his right shoulder. A necropsy report confirmed that he died from his bullet wounds. Another male yearling was found on August 17 at Point Dume. He'd been shot through the cheek. In October, another two sea lions riddled with bullet wounds were discovered. On October 10, a sea lion with four gunshot wounds washed up at Broad Beach. He died 30 minutes after being rescued. The next day, another dead sea lion appeared at Big Rock. The bullet came from a high caliber gun. Donna Collins and her daughter were watching fishermen in Malibu one night when they said they were shocked to hear gunshots. 'We started hearing the gunshots. And they weren’t M-80s, they weren’t flash bombs. They were rifles,' Collins said. David Reilly, a special agent at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said he is investigating the cases. He said it’s tough to find the culprits and investigators rely on tips from the public. 'You almost have to see it for a prosecution to be made,' he told NBC.

Newspaper bosses last night announced plans to mount an extraordinary legal challenge to plans to impose on the Press a Royal Charter written by politicians. They are to argue that the Government’s handling of a rival Royal Charter proposed by the newspaper and magazine industry was unlawful. Industry bodies – through the Press Standards Board of Finance, which funds the existing regulatory system – are to apply to the High Court for judicial review. Industry bodies, through the Press Standards Board of Finance, will apply to the High Court for a judicial review . They will argue a decision by the Privy Council, a secretive body of ministers which advises the Queen, to reject an industry-backed charter in favour of one agreed behind closed doors by the three main political parties, should be quashed. Earlier this month, politicians agreed the detail of their own charter designed to oversee newspaper regulation in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into media standards. An alternative proposal put forward by the Press, which would have meant a new independent regulator having strong investigative powers and the right to impose fines of up to £1million for wrongdoing, up-front corrections, with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently, and independence from the industry and politicians, was rejected. Planning minister Nick Boles suggested newspapers should refuse to cooperate and mount a legal challenge against the way the Government has handled the issue . It is thought to be the first time the Queen has been asked to sign a Royal Charter imposing a system of regulation on an unwilling industry. One close ally of the Prime Minister, planning minister Nick Boles, suggested newspapers should refuse to cooperate and mount a legal challenge against the way the Government has handled the issue. The Spectator magazine has already . announced it will refuse to take part in regulation overseen by the . politicians’ charter and take its chances in the courts. The . Government has passed legislation meaning that newspapers that refuse . to join a new regulator will be hit with ‘exemplary’ damages and . punitive costs in libel and privacy cases. However, . senior figures including Lord Lester, an eminent QC who is the . architect of reforms to the libel laws, have suggested that would . violate article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which . protects freedom of expression. This week, an international coalition of free speech groups warned that the ‘repressive’ plans to regulate Britain’s 300-year-old free press will undermine the country’s international standing and the reputation of the Queen. The warning was signed by the World Press Freedom Committee, the International Press Institute and the Commonwealth Press Union among others. Lord Black of Brentwood, chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, said: ‘The decision by the Government and the Privy Council on this matter has enormous ramifications for free speech both here in the UK, and – because of our leadership role in the Commonwealth and developing world – across the globe. Politicians agreed the detail of their own charter designed to oversee newspaper regulation in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry . Lord Black of Brentwood, chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, said the Government's decision has 'enormous ramifications for free speech' ‘The Government and the Privy Council . should have applied the most rigorous standards of consultation and . examination of the Royal Charter proposed by the industry, which would . have enshrined tough regulatory standards at the same time as protecting . Press freedom. ‘They singularly failed to do so, and that is why – as the issues at stake are so extraordinarily high – we are having to take this course of action.’ The Mayor of London Boris Johnson backed the move by the newspapers. He told the Mail: ‘The state has no business trying to regulate the content of newspapers. In America they wouldn’t dream of doing it, so why do it here? ‘A free press is the bedrock of democracy and any Royal Charter needs to be fully and properly consulted on – anything less risks  outcomes that threaten those freedoms.’ The industry will argue that despite repeated requests, the Privy Council refused to discuss what criteria they used to judge its charter until after it had decided to reject it. It claims that the application was not dealt with fairly, that the press had a right to be consulted which the Government and the Privy Council failed to do, and that the procedures deployed were ‘irrational’. In a separate announcement, industry representatives announced a final set of plans to set up a new Independent Press Standards Organisation. Paul Vickers, chairman of the industry group which has drawn up the plans and executive director of Trinity Mirror plc, said after nine months of work and consultation a ‘tough, independent and effective regulator’ was in sight.","Industry bodies, through Press Stands Board of Finance, are to apply to the High Court for judicial review .

A judge approved the appointment of death penalty expert Judy Clarke to defend 19-year-old Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev . Tsarnaev has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction during the April 15 marathon. Three people were killed and more than 260 injured when two bombs exploded near the finish line . But judge Marianne Bowler denied, at least for now, a request from Tsarnaev's public defender, Miriam Conrad, to appoint a second death penalty lawyer - David Bruck, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. Tsarnaev's lawyers could renew their motion to appoint another death penalty expert if he is indicted, the judge said. The news that he could escape the death penalty for divulging information was reported on NBC News. High-profile defendants: Clarke successfully . represented Theodore Kaczynski, aka the Unabomber (left), and 1996 . Atlanta Olympics bomber Eric Rudolph (right), both of whom received life . terms . Defense strategy: Like with most of her cases, . Clarke got Jared Loughner, the gunman in the 2011 Tuscon, Arizona, . massacre, to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence . Clarke's clients have included the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski; Susan Smith, a woman who famously drowned her two children; Atlanta Olympics bomber Eric Rudolph; and most recently Jared Loughner, who shot former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in the head. All received life sentences instead of the death penalty. Clarke has rarely spoken publicly about her work, however, at a speech Friday at a legal conference in Los Angeles, she talked about how she had been 'sucked into the black hole, the vortex' of death penalty cases 18 years ago when she represented Smith.

'I got a dose of understanding human behavior, and I learned what the death penalty does to us,' she said. 'I don't think it's a secret that I oppose the death penalty.' Bruck has directed Washington and Lee's death penalty defense clinic, the Virginia Capital Case Clearinghouse, since 2004.

The U.S. Air Force Academy may drop a religious reference from an oath cadets take to swear allegiance to the school's honor code after a religious freedom group said it's a litmus test for honesty. The Military Religious Freedom Foundation protested the ""so help me God"" phrase that was added to the end of an oath that has cadets swearing they won't lie, cheat, steal or tolerate those who do. The religious freedom foundation says tying the honor code to a religious test violates the U.S. Constitution. Considering a change: The US Air Force Academy is considering changing the end of its oath to appease religious freedom groups . 'To tie the honor code to a religious test violates the no-establishment clause of the Constitution,' said Mikey Weinstein, founder of the foundation and a frequent academy critic. The academy says it is considering several options, including dumping the entire honor oath. Another possibility is to make the ecclesiastical reference optional, the Colorado Springs Gazette reported Thursday. 'We need to be respectful of all people of faith and all people of no faith,' said academy spokesman David Cannon. 'Our goal is to do the right thing for the Air Force Academy.' The oath to obey the honor code came into use at the academy after 19 seniors were disciplined for cheating on a physics exam in 1984. The honor code was adopted by cadets in 1956, a year after the first class entered the academy.

A 'fit and healthy' pregnant army major died suddenly in her sleep just weeks before the birth of her baby daughter. Lesley Boden went to bed at her home in West Wellow, Hampshire, but suffered an unexplained cardiac death called sudden adult death syndrome (SADS), which also killed her unborn daughter, Rosina Eleanor. At the time of her death in May this year, Ms Boden, who was based at 17 Port and Maritime Regiment, Marchwood, Hampshire, was seven-and-a half months pregnant. Her pregnancy had been 'reassuringly normal' with no problems, an inquest in Winchester was told. Lesley Boden went to bed but suffered an unexplained cardiac death, which also killed her unborn daughter, Rosina Eleanor. Her pregnancy had been 'reassuringly normal' with no problems, an inquest heard . The 33-year-old had spoken to her partner Richard Wade and her mother Angela on the evening before she was found dead, and all was well. In a short statement Mr Wade, who is also an army major in the 2nd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said he had spoken to her on Skype on May 15 because he was then based in Cyprus. 'We talked about the baby and me coming home in a few days’ time. Nothing was out of the normal. Lesley appeared happy and in good health,' he said. Sudden Adult Death Syndrome is a . group of conditions that can cause sudden death in adults. They are . caused by an abnormality of the rhythms of the heart. In about one in five cases of sudden cardiac death in young people, no definite cause of death can be found. This applies even once drugs have been excluded as a cause and a pathologist has examined the heart for structural abnormalities. These deaths are attributed to SADS. It occurs when a cardiac arrest is brought on by a problem with the electrical functioning of the heart, even though the person has no disease affecting the heart. The alarm was raised when work colleagues could not get hold her on May 16 and Sergeant Major Mark Watson and Lieutenant Rachel Gibbs went to her house and broke in. In a statement, Mr Watson said the pair searched the house calling Ms Boden’s name before they went upstairs and into a bedroom where he saw a ruffled duvet and said he smelt the smell of death. 'I could Lesley Boden on the bed,' he explained. 'She looked to be sleeping, her eyes were closed and she seemed peaceful. She was cold to the touch.' Mr Watson noticed some skin discolouration and riger mortis and could not find a pulse and told his officer: 'Do not come in. You do not need to see this.' He then said he covered Ms Boden with her duvet and said: 'Rest, Lesley' and 999 was called. She had been dead for at least six hours, the hearing was told. Pathologist Adnan Al-Badri said he could find no problems or infection in all of Ms Boden’s organs and tests showed there was no alcohol or drugs in her system. The baby and its placenta were also completely normal with no signs of problems or infection, the hearing was told. 'I could not find a cause for Lesley’s sudden death having examined all her organs and having examined the baby and the placenta,' he explained. 'We do not know really what she died of but the most likely cause is a sudden cardiac death and the reason for that is that we ruled out any other cause of her death. 'Although her heart looked normal that does not rule out problems with the electric conduction of the heart that can cause death. Sudden Adult Death Syndrome is a group of conditions that can cause sudden death in adults. They are caused by an abnormality of the rhythms of the heart . 'And the fact that the lungs had fluid in them shows that the final process is the heart stopping.' He added: 'Sudden Adult Death Syndrome is a group of conditions that can cause sudden death in adults. They are caused by an abnormality of the rhythms of the heart.' The expert said that this can be hereditary or acquired, but medicine cannot be precise how and when the condition will strike. He added that he did not believe that Ms Boden being pregnant had any effect on what happened. The family of Ms Boden and Mr Wade . released a statement after the hearing which said: 'The sudden death of . Lesley has devastated us. “She . was a loving caring, intelligent and beautiful young woman who was . looking forward to the birth of her baby girl in a few weeks’ time.' Recording a verdict of death by natural causes caused by sudden unexpected maternal/adult death, Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame Short said: 'It’s a clearly very sad death of an apparently fit and healthy woman in the last stages of a pregnancy which makes the loss even harder because her daughter died in utero at the same time.' He explained that no underlying condition or problem had been found and added to Mr Wade and Ms Boden’s mother and family: 'I realise that this is not altogether satisfactory but I have to accept that, within the limitations of medical knowledge at this time, it’s not always possible to be absolutely specific.'","Lesley Boden was seven-and-a half months pregnant when she suffered an unexplained cardiac death which killed her unborn .

A school binder decorated with pictures of a 13-year-old's older brother and her softball team nearly led the girl being kicked out of school, her mother claims. Seen in his military uniform, a photograph of Brianna Gentry's older brother Derrick who is stationed in Montana as a military policeman is one of several pictures on her school binder. 'My brother is very important to me. I haven't seen him in a while,' Brianna told KTLA on her reasoning behind the photo's placement. Scroll down for video . Problem: The mother of Brianna Gentry says her daughter was nearly kicked out of school for keeping pictures of her softball team and brother in his military uniform on her binder . Long distance: Brianna says her brother is stationed as a military policeman in Montana so rarely sees him, prompting her to keep the photo of him close to her . Around him are also pictures of her softball team. Both pictures, however, as Brianna recently learned, do not comply with her school's rules with the eighth grader's membership of their AVID programme for top or advanced students. 'The counsellor took me out of class twice telling me that the pictures aren't AVID material,' Brianna said. 'But they haven't pulled out any other students with pictures out from their class. Just me.' According to the school, which sent a copy of AVID's rules home for her to re-read, all students must 'maintain the AVID binder with assignments, grade sheets, and daily notes as required.' The issue: The pictures clash with her school's rules specific for their AVID programme's students which Brianna is a member of . Angry: Finding that the AVID rules don't list pictures on binders as banned, Brianna's mother wrote a letter to the school saying her daughter will keep the pictures in place . Finding school officials' argument against her daughter's photographs absurd, and not in conflict with what they had agreed to, Brianna's mother fired back. 'These items are in her binder and will remain in her binder. The contract does not say a student cannot have pictures in the outside sleeve. 'The principal told me yesterday the rule is based on interpretation. Having a neat, clean binder is a matter of opinion. 'We will follow the rules set forth which do not include the removal of photos.' 'Her brother is a positive role model in her life,' her mother Jaima Eudy told KTLA. 'Her softball team she's very active in little league, she has been for six years. So, these are things that are happy moments for her.' Agreement: Coming to an agreement, Brianna was allowed to keep the photo of her brother in her binder but had to remove her softball team . After some back and forth, the school came to an amended conclusion this week. 'We want our students to be successful and if this is the type of motivation that is going to help this young lady or any other student succeed, then by all means we will support her efforts,' school district spokeswoman Linda Bardere told KTLA. But the picture of her softball team still had to be removed they decided. 'I'd rather have my brother in my pictures than have nothing at all,' Brianna said. 'So, I'm fine with the decision.'

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 09:22 EST, 25 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:22 EST, 25 July 2013 . The birth of Prince George has been a massive boon for many manufacturers, but one company lost out after it produced 5,000 commemorative plates celebrating the arrival of a 'Royal Princess'. Other objects produced to mark the historic birth this week include Lego, dolls and an official porcelain collection - but most had the wisdom to wait and find out the baby's sex before launching their memorabilia. However, one unnamed firm supposedly had a tip-off from a royal insider that the Duchess of Cambridge was set to give birth to a girl, and designed plates with the message: 'To celebrate the birth of the Royal Princess'. Blunder: These plates were made by a company which couldn't wait to find out the sex of the royal baby . Not a girl: Prince George was born on Monday afternoon, rendering the plates somewhat redundant . The family-owned company is said to have had 'complete confidence in their inside man' - but on Monday evening, it was announced that Kate and William's new baby was in fact a prince. When the future monarch turned out to be a boy rather than a girl, the company was left with a vast amount of unsellable merchandise. The plates, which feature a stock photo of a baby alongside garish pink squiggles, are unlikely to be particularly popular now that the firm's prediction has been proven wrong. The useless memorabilia was snapped up by online retailer Wholesale Clearance UK, which is selling the plates in lots of 50, with each set costing £149 - or £2.98 per item. Useless: The 5,000 plates which were produced were sold as a job lot to a wholesaling website . On the website, the crockery is described as 'a piece of (inaccurate) history' which will allow the buyer to 'give your colleagues the worst Secret Santa gift ever' or 'have a dangerous game of frisbee'. The listing, which is placed in the 'Novelty' section of Wholesale Clearance's site, praises the 'obvious gimmick factor' of the kitsch merchandise - although £149 seems like a lot to pay for an ironic purchase. Suggestions for how to make use of a box of 50 plates include 'Have a plate smashing contest' and 'Take up plate spinning as a hobby'. However, most people who buy the erroneous products will presumably be doing so as an investment - hoping that their relative rarity will ensure they are a good investment for the future. Wholesale Clearance appears to have taken account of this possibility, suggesting: 'Wait for baby number two and hope it is a girl and sell them for considerable profit'. Pricey: This official collection of royal memorabilia costs £195 for a loving cup and £45 for a dessert plate . The company which made the plates was not alone in assuming that Kate would give birth to a girl - shortly before she went into labour, bookmakers were offering odds of 8/15 on a princess, compared to 11/8 for a prince. The assumption that the baby was more likely to be a girl is probably due to an apparent slip of the tongue from the Duchess, who referred to 'our d-' in a meeting with the public in March. In addition, many people were particularly excited about the possibility of a princess because of the recent law change ensuring that females can inherit the British throne on the same terms as males. Royal fanatics looking for more accurate crockery can purchase an official plate from the Royal Collection Trust, for the price of £45. The official range of porcelain, which was announced yesterday, goes up to £195 for a limited edition loving cup.","Unnamed company received 'insider tip-off' that royal baby would be a girl .

Education chiefs in Edinburgh have taken 'appropriate action' against Ms Kelly, who reported herself to the headteacher as soon as the furore erupted. Teachers are regularly warned about the perils of posting on social media and advised that careless remarks could land them in disciplinary trouble. Professor Green seems to have become aware of Ms Kelly’s 'couldn’t be arsed' comment after she entered into discussion with him about the motivation of teachers. Professor Green, who turned down a place at private school to follow his friends to a comprehensive, had commented online that 'there’s so much more to life' than exam results.

Digital artist Michal Karcz collects pictures with his digital camera that he thinks will suit a composition he has in mind . He then sets about creating the 'Parallel World', which can take months to finish, by hand-stitching the images together like a collage on a powerful graphics computer . He then goes on to use bespoke, tailor-made lighting effects to make his dream become a reality . The artist, from Warsaw, Poland, said: 'I always wanted to create pictures which I had in mind or dreamed about' Each image starts as a photo snapped in real life - and then Mr Karcz lets his imagination run wild. When he has gathered enough images the artist uploads them to his computer and begins layering and blending them on photo editing software. He then adds light effects and colours and manipulates the pictures until they look exactly as he imagined them while he was asleep or daydreaming. Prints of the Parallel Worlds images cost from £80 to £280. He said when he has a clear image in his mind he starts searching for appropriate locations or photos in his huge library, or he shoots some new photographs . Some of the images are so realistic and familiar they look as if they could be single photographs . He achieves the dream like images by taking an initial picture, then adding light effects, colours, curves, photomanipulation, and collages, and after mixing they are complete . He said: 'All of the pictures are in my head and they are my parallel worlds - I feel that I visit them each time I listen to music, close my eyes or sleep' Mr Karcz, from Warsaw, Poland, said: 'I always wanted to create pictures which I had in mind or dreamed about. 'All of the pictures are in my head and they are my parallel worlds - I feel that I visit them each time I listen to music, close my eyes or sleep. 'When I have a clear idea in my mind I start searching for appropriate locations or photos in my huge library, or I shoot some new photographs. 'Everywhere I go I take my camera with me. I always see frames, possible pictures, scenes, and compositions. The artist says he takes his camera with him 'everywhere he goes', in order to make sure he has all the possible elements of his dream like compositions . The digital artist said he always tries to make the images exactly as he has seen in his imagination, and the work can be painstaking . The former painter said that digital photography and software has given him the opportunity to generate unique realities that are impossible to create with ordinary dark room technique . The haunting images often feature large or abandoned structures jutting out of desert like landscapes, with a small solitary figure making their way across scene . 'First of all I take an initial picture, after this I add light effects, colours, curves, photo-manipulation, and collages, and after mixing they are complete. 'I always try to make it as I saw it in my imagination, and a lot of the time it can take a while because the weather and lighting are very important. 'I create my artworks in postproduction. It could be one photo altered to cover my vision or manipulated, photomontage from few or many photos.' Some of the most creative minds in history have had their best ideas or found inspiration in sleep - including surrealist Salvador Dali . He said: 'I always try to make an extraordinary picture and my goal is to make a viewer stop for a minute, to influence on emotions and take away from reality' Some of the most creative minds in history have had their best ideas or found inspiration in sleep, including surrealist artist Salvador Dali. Brian Wilson, the creative genius behind the Beach Boys stayed in bed for two years at the height of his band's fame. And the Beatles' Paul McCartney claims that the tune for the band's  hit song Yesterday came to him in a dream . Artist Tracey Emin created the 1999 Turner Prize nominated My Bed, after a week spent in her bed following a painful break-up.","Michal Karcz conjures up the alternate universes while snoozing then transforms his dreams into reality .
