"For more than four decades it has ranked among the largest, most useful planes in the Pentagon's arsenal, but a C-5 Galaxy has never been retired to any museum. That's about to change. The behemoth nicknamed Zero-One-Four arrived at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware Wednesday, where it soon will be handed over to the Air Mobility Command Museum. The giant jet with 90014 painted on its tail made history in 1974 when it became the only aircraft ever to drop and ignite a live, Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile. Yep, that's correct -- it launched the Cold War weapon that was designed to wreak unspeakable nuclear annihilation. Of course, this particular missile was unarmed. If it seems odd that a plane would unleash a gigantic hammer like a Minuteman -- well, it is. These missiles weren't supposed to launch from airplanes. They were supposed to blast off from underground silos. ""It was radical,"" said nuclear weapons expert Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists. ""It broke with anything that had been done with ballistic missiles before -- or since."" The idea of launching Minutemen via airplanes was an attempt to protect U.S. missiles from being destroyed by enemy missiles, Kristensen said, because the Soviet Union would have had a hard time targeting Minutemen traveling aboard airplanes like the C-5. With three stages, the Minuteman measured 56 feet and weighed 86,000 pounds. Never before had the C-5 -- one of the biggest planes in the world -- ever dropped such a heavy load. Related: Stalking the world's biggest planes . On October 24, 1974, at Utah's Hill Air Force Base, airmen and crew from manufacturers Lockheed and Boeing, boarded Zero-One-Four. Among them, Chief Master Sgt. James Sims, who watched the whole thing from the C-5's cargo hold -- the best seat in the house. ""There was inherent danger in it,"" said Sims, describing the mission. The Minuteman was attached to a special cradle designed to be released on a track leading out the plane's rear cargo exit. Parachutes would drag the missile out of the plane and then point it upward. A timer, Sims said, would spark the rocket's fiery engines. The risks were significant. If the Minuteman exited the plane incorrectly it could dangerously push the C-5's nose upward, making it difficult to control. Another risk: the missile could accidentally become wedged in the aircraft's infrastructure, shifting the plane's center of gravity and -- in a worst-case scenario -- trigger a crash. As the C-5 reached its test range off California about 20,000 feet over the Pacific, its four powerful jet engines were singing their signature whine. With the drop zone only eight minutes away, the huge rear cargo door opened, exposing Sims and his crew mate, Technical Sgt. Elmer Hardin, to the roaring wind. Soon it was go time. The missile and its cradle were released. Parachutes dragged the 43-ton payload along its track down the 121-foot cargo hold until it toppled off into oblivion. Hardin felt the giant plane begin to tip. ""You did come off the floor a bit,"" he told the Air Mobility Command Museum Foundation's ""Hangar Digest"" magazine. ""It was like dumping a wheelbarrow full of water."" The chutes tilted the missile vertical as it fell thousands of feet and disappeared into the clouds underneath. Then, nothing. For a minute Sims thought something was wrong. Suddenly from below, Sims saw plumes of smoke and flame. ""It came blasting through the clouds and you got a good view of it,"" Sims said. It rocketed to 30,000 feet -- 10,000 feet above the C-5, as Sims remembers it. ""It looked like a missile launch from Cape Canaveral,"" he said. It burned for about 25 seconds, he recalled, and then ""cascaded into the Pacific Ocean."" ""Everything worked as advertised,"" he said. ""I was elated. ... It was special."" YouTube has Air Force film of the test . Although the mid-air missile launch worked, the Pentagon never adopted the concept. Skeptics likely would have seen the project as ""a little crazy,"" Kristensen said, because it was technically very risky and would have been operationally very expensive to implement on a wider, more permanent scale. It was a ""wild card dream,"" he said. At the time, the idea wasn't really outside the box, said Fritz W. Ermarth, a nuclear strategy expert, ex-CIA analyst and former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. Pulling a missile out of an aircraft ""on a sled with parachutes was far from rocket science,"" Ermarth said. But war planners of the era were expected to invent new options to protect the nation's nuclear weapons arsenal. Kristensen credited the project to a ""sort of Cold War euphoria in those days that spurred people to come up with these sort of ideas."" Many wonder if the C-5 Minuteman demonstration was simply a stunt intended to show strength at a time when the Soviets were negotiating with Washington over a proposed nuclear arms treaty. It wasn't ever officially announced, said Pat O'Brien, an engineer on the project, ""but we felt they were trying to use this as a bargaining tool for the SALT II (Strategic Arms Limitation) Talks."" Retired Air Force crew chief Rodney Moore, who helped maintain Zero-One-Four during its Dover heyday, wanted to go on that mission. He asked to take part, but was turned down. ""I was disappointed,"" he recalls. Even all these years later, Moore says he still wishes he had pressed harder for permission. ""I loved that airplane,"" said Moore. As its primary crew chief, Moore inspected the aircraft before each flight. He marshaled it to Dover's runways and then watched it take off. ""For a very short period of time, I was a part of that airplane's career,"" Moore says. ""And it was a major part of my life."" Moore, who hasn't seen Zero-One-Four in 30 years, looks forward to the jet's dedication ceremony, set for this fall. ""I'm going to have some emotions about it,"" Moore admits. ""I know I'm gonna feel pride."" ""It's going to be like a reunion with an old friend.""","Air Force crew recall their launch of a Minuteman ICBM from an airplane .

"Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson will tentatively go to trial December 1 on a felony child abuse charge, but that date could be pushed back if a Texas judge must recuse himself for calling attorneys ""media whores."" Until the trial is finished, Peterson will be barred from having contact with the son involved in the criminal case, but the judge set no such parameters for Peterson's contact with his other children. Peterson, who was accompanied by his wife, other family members and legal team, appeared in court during the brief Wednesday hearing. One of his attorneys, Rusty Hardin, and Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon engaged in a serious conversation for about 30 minutes before approaching the bench. It was difficult for those in the gallery to hear what was being said among the lawyers and judge, but Hardin's spokeswoman said after the hearing, ""I don't think the judge ever asked for a plea. As we said yesterday, if the judge asks, Peterson will plead not guilty."" It's not clear when Peterson will enter a plea, but a recusal hearing for 9th District Court Judge Kelly Case was set for November. The possibility of a recusal was raised after Ligon approached the bench with Hardin's legal team and told Case, ""It's come to my attention that on October 2 you referred to Mr. Hardin as a whore."" ""I'm sorry?"" Case interjected. ""... Mr. Hardin as a whore, specifically a media whore. And you also called me a whore or a media whore,"" Ligon said before requesting an apology. ""Yeah, that was meant as a humorous joke,"" Case said, ""and unfortunately humor is sometimes taken the wrong way."" Ligon said the remark could prejudice Peterson's case and be construed as ""biased toward the state of Texas"" and again asked for an apology. ""Yes. Of course. I apologize to both of you,"" the judge responded. ""That's not how I feel about any of you. I think you're doing a great job, and I've known Mr. Hardin for 25 years."" Hardin said, ""Just for the record, I didn't take offense to it. I've been called much worse."" Vikings star sitting out . Peterson -- who in 2011 signed a seven-year contract worth more than $100 million and is considered one of the NFL's best running backs, if not the best -- left the Vikings last month after the team deactivated, then activated and deactivated him again following accusations that he whipped his 4-year-old son with a ""switch,"" or slender tree branch. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters in New York after a lengthy meeting Wednesday with the league's 32 team owners that administering punishment to a player who is waiting for his legal case to move forward after an arrest can be complex. ""(The owners) obviously understand the balance between due process and protecting the integrity of the game,"" he said. ""Sometimes that puts you in a difficult position."" Goodell said there was discussion whether or not a new, interim step -- such as paid leave -- should be added to the process. The commissioner reiterated that domestic violence and the league's discipline for violators of its conduct policy are serious issues, ones he discussed with the owners for five hours. He said ""a majority of our players are great people and men"" and said domestic violence is not just an NFL issue, it's a societal issue. Peterson faces up to two years in jail . Authorities have not divulged details of the case against Peterson, but photos obtained by TMZ allegedly show Peterson's son's leg covered in marks, some of which appeared to have broken the skin. Peterson turned himself in and was released on a $15,000 bond. According to Texas law, people can be convicted of injury to a child if they cause bodily or mental injury ""intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence"" or cause such harm by omission. The crime is punishable by up to two years in a state jail and a $1,000 fine. Hardin has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like ""he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas."" Peterson likewise defended himself, saying he is ""not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser."" Wednesday's hearing came a day after the Star Tribune in Minneapolis published a scathing report alleging that the Vikings turned a blind eye to Peterson's brushes with the law and moral shortcomings ""until suddenly no one could look away."" The newspaper also alleges Peterson engaged in improprieties with one of his charities. Angry tweets . In a series of three tweets that began ""Journalism 101,"" the former Oklahoma University standout refutes the allegations in 11 bullet points and closes by tweeting, ""10. I guess never let the truth get in the way of a good story"" and ""11. Take time to be GREAT and to get it right."" After Wednesday's hearing, Hardin acknowledged recent reports attacking his client's character and told reporters on the courthouse steps, ""There's always another side, and I hope y'all will start chasing the other side some."" Asked for the other side, Hardin responded, ""I'm not going to get into that"" and later told reporters, ""Adrian is chomping at the bit to publicly talk and to publicly defend himself,"" but has been advised against it by his legal team. He went on to describe Peterson as a ""really good man"" and asserted, ""This is a case about parenting decision and whether something unfortunate happened when a parenting decision was made by a man who believes strongly and loves his children very much."" The case won't be resolved in the media, he said, adding that the only solution was a speedy trial. ""I'm confident that the people here will see that the real Adrian will be the same before all this ever happened,"" Hardin said before escorting  Peterson to a vehicle waiting in front of the courthouse.

"Chris Berkey makes his living plying the often treacherous waters of the Great Lakes, delivering staples like cement to industries nestled in the myriad harbors that dot a coastline that's equal to nearly half of the circumference of the globe. It's not glamorous work, but it is critical to the U.S. economy. And it's getting harder. Water levels in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron fell to record low levels for December, and are expected to break the all-time low sometime in the next few months. Cargo ships like Berkey's are being forced to lighten their loads, some harbors have already been forced to close and the tourist trade is bracing for an impact as well. ""In years past, there was always a buffer,"" he said. ""That buffer's gone."" It's not a new problem. Lake levels have been below average for at least 13 years, said Keith Kompoltowicz, chief of watershed hydrology for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Detroit. But it is an increasingly serious one: . -- The coal trade on the Great Lakes declined 8.2% in 2012 from the previous year, and down a quarter off the 5-year-averge -- in large part due to falling water levels and a $200 million backlog in necessary dredging throughout the lakes, according to the Lake Carriers' Association.-- Commercial fishing boats are finding it increasingly difficult to navigate some harbors, risking a downturn in a vital part of the Great Lakes economy, said Mark Breederland, an educator with Michigan SeaGrant, which works with coastal communities on water-level issues, among other things.-- Charter boat operations and other businesses in coastal communities that depend on tourism fear the impact lower water levels will have from spring to fall, when tens of thousands of people flow into the state to boat, fish, eat out and shop. Fishing lure . In Frankfort, Michigan, a popular salmon run on the Betsie River draws tourists drawn by the lure of fishing a rare naturally replenished population of the prized fish, said city manager Josh Mills. ""We see people from Texas, from Georgia, from Ohio, Illinois, other areas of Michigan,"" he said. But low lake levels last year dried up the run, leaving salmon flopping in the mud, and forcing the state Department of Natural Resources to close the run to protect the population. It appears a good number of the fish made it to their spawning grounds, but if water levels don't recover in the spring, the narrow channel through which the fish pass could dry up once again -- prompting tourists to find someplace else to go, Breederland said. Also of concern: potential access problems at some of the private marinas dotting Betsie Bay, Mills said. Read more: Sailing the world's most beautiful lakes . Despite efforts to diversify the city's economy in recent years, such problems would be a huge blow to the tiny community of 1,300, the city manager said. ""I'm confident the community will step up,"" he said. ""But if there's no water, we're going to miss out on a lot of activity."" Precipitation and evaporation . The problem is a long-term cycle of too little water from melting snow and rain to counter the effects of evaporation on the lakes, Kompoltowicz. Last winter, too little snow fell on the Great Lakes region to fully replenish the lakes. While Lake Michigan and Lake Huron typically rise a foot after the spring melt, the lakes only rose four inches last spring, Kompoltowicz said. Add that tiny rise to a very hot, very dry summer that sucked water out of the lake like a straw, and you have a recipe for the decline in lake levels under way today, eh said. There's too little data to say the problem is a product of global warming, he said. It's also a cycle that's been seen before. Lake levels were nearly this low in December 1964, and it's the March 1964 record that's likely to fall in the next few months. There is hope, he said. Records dating back to 1918 would seem to indicate a cyclical pattern that could well result in record lake levels in the next few years, he said. Such swings occurred in the 1970s and 1980s after similar low points. Dredging backlog . But even if the water returns, what would appear to be a more intractable problem looms: Congress. Groups with interests in the economy of the Great Lakes say Congress has failed to appropriate enough money to keep up with a growing backlog of dredging jobs needed to keep harbors clear for larger boats. As a result, 17 million tons of sediment -- runoff from farms, mostly --  built up in harbors and other critical areas, said Glen Nekvasil, vice president of the Lake Carriers' Association, a trade association for commercial cargo interests. Michigan Sen. Carl Levin has been pushing Congress to appropriate an unspent balance of nearly $7 billion in a trust fund designed to pay for such work, but to little avail so far -- much to the chagrin of interests along the lakeshore. The fund takes in $1.6 billion a year, but only spends $800 million a year nationside, Nevkasil said. ""The money is there,"" he said. ""They just need to use it."" Wasting Away . The concern about lake levels has even spread to Chicago's wastewater treatment program, where a spate of recent media coverage worried that declining lake levels could cause the heavily managed Chicago River to reverse its course and dump sewage into Lake Michigan. Chicago's Metropolitan Water Reclamation District issued a press released Friday batting down the theory, saying it's just not possible for such a thing to happen. But it could result in restrictions on river traffic as the agency works with the Corps to ensure problems with low oxygen levels in the river, the agency said in its relase. ""We are not in a crisis at this time nor do we anticipate being in a crisis this year even if the drought should continue,"" the agency said. Light loads . While the big deepwater ships that carry huge quantities of the nation's iron ore, coal and other goods are able to steam the deep waters of the Great Lakes as they always have, they must carry ever lighter loads to avoid grounding on the increasingly shallow harbors where they unload. For instance, Nekvasil visited a ship Friday in Indiana Harbor, Indiana that's designed to carry 76,000 tons of iron ore. Because of low water levels and the harbors filing with silt, it can only carry 58,000 tons, he said. As of now, light-loading is merely a matter of efficency, Nevkasil said. But that's in large part because the fragile economic recovery has not yet put a full burner under the nation's industry. ""We can meet demand now because the economy is not fully recovered,"" he said. ""If demand for all of the cargo we move was at peak levels, we could not."" While the situation has not yet resulted in job losses among ship crews, Burkey said some of the businesses to which he's long delivered supplies are shutting down because the harbors are just too unreliable. Others are switching to truck and rail to bring supplies. Some harbors also are planning to shut down, said Breederland, while others may not be able to accommodate some larger recreational and charter boats that bring tourists to the region when the weather warms. That worries Steve Christian, the owner of Dinghy's restaurant in Frankfort. About 70 percent of his sales come during the summer fishing season. ""If they can't get into the harbor and go fish, they're not going to be coming into my restaurant and ordering food and beverages,"" he said. Still he said, he's pretty sure things will return to normal in a few years. ""This has happened before in the living man's memory,"" he said. ""It's cyclical, and we'll recover.""","Water levels in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron are expected to set a record low .

"Foreign ministers from 11 countries meeting here cited the presence of foreign fighters in the country and the alleged use of chemical weapons by Damascus in agreeing Saturday to increase arms shipments to the rebels. In a statement, the ministers representing the ""London 11,"" an offshoot of the ""Friends of Syria,"" said they would ""provide urgently all the necessary materiel and equipment to the opposition on the ground, each country in  its own way in order to enable them to counter brutal attacks by the regime and its allies and protect the Syrian people."" The weapons are to be funneled through the opposition Free Syrian Army's Supreme Military Council (SMC). The alleged use of chemical weapons, which President Bashar al-Assad has denied, and the involvement of Hezbollah and Iran left the participants no choice ""but to provide greater assistance of one kind or another, each nation making its own decision as to what it is comfortable doing, but all of them committing to do more to help the Syrian opposition,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters. Kerry called for a political settlement, not a military one, even as he expressed support for aiding the opposition. ""President Obama made it clear that, as a result of the crossing of the red lines and the use of the chemical weapons, he was going to provide assistance that he hasn't provided before,"" Kerry said without specifying what that aid would include. ""We have said today very clearly we are going to step up in order to provide the capacity to the SMC and to the Syrian opposition to be able to directly address the situation on the ground -- now, that's as specific as I can be."" Kerry said he hoped that plans for a second conference in Geneva would soon coalesce. The United States and Russia announced on May 7 they would try to bring the warring parties to a Geneva-2 conference to implement the peace plan they endorsed a year ago -- at what has come to be called Geneva-1 -- that left open the question of whether Assad must leave power. But in their statement on Saturday, the ministers reiterated their call for negotiations that would lead to the establishment of a transitional governing body ""that excludes the central figures and associates whose hands are stained with blood. In this context, Bashar al-Assad has no role in the transitional governing body or thereafter."" ""The implementation of Geneva-1 is the goal of Geneva-2, and that is a transition government with full executive authority, which gives the Syrian people as a whole, everybody in Syria, the chance to have a new beginning where they choose their future leadership,"" Kerry told CNN last week. Next week, Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman and Ambassador Robert Ford will meet with their Russian counterparts and Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N.and Arab League special envoy to Syria, to set a date for the meeting, Kerry said. The broadening of the conflict and the possibility that it will devolve into a sectarian war raise concerns that the conflict will widen beyond Syria's borders, he said. ""It is our hope that, indeed, we will avoid a regional war."" Kerry noted that Moscow has been sending arms to the government in Damascus, but said he believed that President Vladimir Putin was prepared to support the Geneva meeting. The diplomatic group, known as the London Eleven, met in Doha to figure out how to shift the balance of power on the Syrian battlefield away from al-Assad and toward the opposition. Al-Assad has the upper hand militarily, due to his access to air power and heavy artillery, including tanks. Rebel forces have no air power and few heavy weapons. But Syrian rebels said this week that they have received anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles from ""brotherly nations that support the Syrian revolution."" Washington is providing more than $815 million in humanitarian assistance to victims of the conflict and has committed $250 million in nonlethal aid to the Syrian opposition. The CIA is training Syrian rebel forces at bases in Jordan, according to senior U.S. officials. Combatants from other countries are also aiding the opposition. Foreign Sunni militants are joining the ranks of the rebels. One of the largest groups, the al-Nusra Front, is affiliated with al Qaeda in neighboring Iraq. Some 5,000 Shiite fighters from Hezbollah have taken up arms in Syria in support of the government, according to Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. The 11 comprise the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

""I do understand that there are people who will look at aspects of what has been resolved here and feel some sense that it's not enough, but we shouldn't forget where progress has been made,"" she said. ""I think agreeing to sustainable development goals is progress,"" Gillard added. About 100 heads of state and government were among roughly 40,000 delegates who attended the meeting, which the U.N. called an ""historic opportunity to define pathways to a safer, more equitable, cleaner, greener and more prosperous world for all."" It came 20 years after the Earth Summit in Rio which adopted Agenda 21, an action plan for sustainable development in the 21st century.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When Ontario, California, Police Sgt. Jeff Quon used his city-issued text messaging pager to exchange hundreds of personal messages, some of a ""sexually explicit"" nature, did he have a right to expect those messages would be kept private? The Supreme Court decided Monday that it will determine whether a police officer has a ""reasonable expectation"" of privacy on his official wireless two-way text-messaging pager. The justices accepted a pair of appeals on this free-speech and privacy dispute, and will hear oral arguments in the spring. At issue is how far a government employer may go to monitor the private communications of its workers when they believe that the use of such equipment is being abused. And the court will explore whether service providers can be held liable for providing those communications without the consent of the sender. Courts have said that private communications -- even when delivered or transmitted through a public portal -- are generally protected from ""unreasonable search and seizure,"" such as handwritten letters sent in sealed envelopes through the U.S. Postal Service. The department has a ""Computer Usage, Internet and E-mail Policy"" that gives workers only limited use for personal communications. Quon signed a statement acknowledging that ""use of these tools for personal benefit is a significant violation of City of Ontario Policy"" and that ""users should have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality when using these resources."" Quon, a SWAT team sergeant, claimed that he was unaware the city's overall policy applied to the department and said there was an ""informal policy [that] allowed officers to maintain their privacy in their text messages as long as they paid the overage charges."" The city's contract with Arch Wireless, now known as USA Mobility, allowed for a 25,000-character limit per month, per device, before overage charges kicked in. Quon acknowledged that he exceeded the limit at least several times and paid the extra charges out of his personal funds, as required by his bosses. Both sides agree that Quon's supervisor grew ""tired of being a bill collector"" of his text-happy officers, and the chief of police ordered a review of the pager transcripts for the two officers with the highest overage, one of whom was Quon. Officials claimed in court that the review was done only ""to determine whether the city's monthly character limit was insufficient to cover business-related messages."" It was only in reading the transcripts voluntarily provided by Arch Wireless from its electronic archives that the often-racy messages to his wife, his girlfriend and a fellow officer were revealed, prompting an internal department investigation. A review of one month found that Quon had sent and received 456 personal messages while on duty, an average of 28 per shift, and only three were deemed work-related. A federal court judge characterized many of the messages as not ""light personal communications,"" as defined in the policy as generally acceptable, but words that were, ""to say the least, sexually explicit in nature."" Quon sued the wireless company and the city for invasion of privacy. That suit and any possible disciplinary action against the officer has been put on hold pending resolution of the larger legal questions. A federal appeals court had ruled for Quon. Because ""the [police] department opted to review the contents of all the messages, work-related and personal, without the consent of Quon, we held that the search was excessively intrusive in light of the noninvestigatory object of the search,"" wrote the three-judge panel. This case deals within the context only of government employees, and legal and technology experts are divided over its application in the private sector, where employees may enjoy less constitutional protection. The city of Ontario is in San Bernardino County, about 37 miles east of Los Angeles. The case is USA Mobility Wireless Inc. v. Quon (08-1332). • Also Monday, the Supreme Court, as expected, dismissed another challenge from several former Guantanamo Bay detainees over their claims of torture and religious discrimination. Four British men, all Muslims and onetime prisoners at the U.S. military prison in Cuba, had sued former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top Pentagon officials, saying they knew of and condoned physical abuse and denial of rights guaranteed under international law. A federal appeals court had rejected a lawsuit -- the second one filed by the men -- saying the officials had immunity from such claims. But in June 2008, the Supreme Court allowed Guantanamo prisoners to challenge their captivity in federal court, and a year ago, the justices urged the lower court to reconsider its decision against the British detainees. In the government filing this fall, Solicitor General Elena Kagan told the high court to exercise caution in granting what she called ""new rights"" to detained foreign fighters suing for damages in a military setting. The high court, she noted, had previously told lower courts ""to pay particular heed to any special factors counseling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation."" The prisoners alleged that their captors beat them, confined them in painful stress positions and used dogs to intimidate the Muslim men during a period from 2002-04. They also claim being forced to shave their beards and being denied prayer mats and religious texts. One foreign fighter suspect also claimed that a military guard threw a copy of the Quran in a toilet, a major insult to the Islamic faith. The case is Rasul v. Myers (09-227).","Supreme Court will hear two appeals regarding messages on government work devices .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Liv Tyler doesn't like to be bothered by her agents at night. But it's a good thing she took their call pitching her ""The Incredible Hulk."" Liv Tyler plays Betty Ross, a colleague of Edward Norton's Bruce Banner, in ""The Incredible Hulk."" ""My agent called me one night ... I had just put [son] Milo to bed. It was like 9 o'clock at night, and I always get grumpy with them when they call me really late,"" she told CNN. ""They said, 'Marvel would like to fly you to Los Angeles tomorrow. Will you get on a plane to come and meet for 'The Hulk'? And I said I can't come tomorrow, but I can come the next day."" The flight turned out to be well worth it -- though Tyler said she was discombobulated by the speed of it all. ""I went and met with [director] Louis [Leterrier] and they offered me the part that day,"" she said.

"Marissa Alexander, a 31-year-old mother of three, is facing a mandatory 20 years behind bars. She had pinned her hopes for freedom on a motion for a new trial; that motion was denied Thursday in a Florida courtroom. In late April, Alexander spoke to CNN as an inmate in the Duval County Jail in Jacksonville, Florida. ""This is my life I'm fighting for,"" she said while wiping away tears. ""If you do everything to get on the right side of the law, and it is a law that does not apply to you, where do you go from there?"" Alexander is referring to Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, a law that has come under scrutiny since the killing of Trayvon Martin. Unlike the Martin case, which involved one stranger killing another, Alexander's case involved her gun and her abusive husband. On August 1, 2010, she said her husband, Rico Gray, read text messages on her phone that she had written to her ex-husband. She said Gray became enraged and accused her of being unfaithful. ""That's when he strangled me. He put his hands around my neck,""  Alexander said. She managed to escape his grip but instead of running out the front door, she ran into the garage, she said, to get into her truck and drive away. Alexander said that in the confusion of the fight, she forgot to get her keys and the garage door wouldn't open, so she made a fateful decision. ""I knew I had to protect myself,"" she said. ""I could not fight him. He was 100 pounds more than me. I grabbed my weapon at that point."" She went back inside the house, and when Gray saw her pistol at her side, she said he threatened to kill her, so she raised the gun and fired one shot. ""I believe when he threatened to kill me, that's what he was absolutely going to do. That's what he intended to do. Had I not discharged my weapon at that point, I would not be here."" Alexander, however, said she did not aim the gun at her husband. She said she fired into the air intending to scare him away, and Gray quickly left the house with his two children. No one was hurt in the incident, but Alexander sits in jail facing a 20-year sentence on three charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Gray admitted to a history of physical abuse. In a previous incident, Alexander said he beat her so severely she ended up in the hospital and he ended up in jail. ""He pushed me, choked me, pushed me so hard into the closet that I hit my head against the wall and passed out for a second,""  Alexander said. In a deposition for the case against Alexander, Gray backed up much of his wife's story. ""I told her if she ever cheated on me, I would kill her,"" he said during the proceeding led by a prosecutor for State Attorney Angela Corey's office and his wife's defense attorney. ""If my kids weren't there, I knew I probably would have tried to take the gun from her,"" Gray said. ""If my kids wouldn't have been there, I probably would have put my hand on her."" When Alexander's defense attorney asked him what he meant by ""put my hand on her,"" Gray replied, ""probably hit her. I got five baby mammas and I put my hands on every last one of them except for one."" Alexander's attorney filed a motion for dismissal under the stand your ground law, but at that proceeding her husband changed his story. Gray said he lied during his deposition after conspiring with his wife in an effort to protect her. At the hearing, he denied threatening to kill his wife, adding, ""I begged and pleaded for my life when she had the gun."" The motion was denied by the judge. Alexander was offered a plea deal by Corey's office, but she opted to go to trial. A jury found Alexander guilty in  12 minutes. She is baffled why invoking the stand your ground law wasn't successful in her case. ""Other defendants have used it. What's so different about my situation that it doesn't apply to me,"" she asked. The local NAACP believes race may have played a role. ""There's a double standard with stand your ground,"" said Isaiah Rumlin, president of the Jacksonville chapter of the NAACP. ""The law is applied differently between African-Americans and whites who are involved in these types of cases,"" he said. Rumlin cited two cases in Florida with white shooters: One had a successful stand your ground defense and the other has yet to be charged with a crime. Online blogs are also raising the question of race. Last week, a spokeswoman for the Rev. Al Sharpton confirmed he, too, was looking into Alexander's story. When asked about race as a factor in her case, Alexander declined to comment. CNN requested an interview with Rico Gray for this story. He agreed but later declined through a family friend, saying he was concerned that speaking publicly would put his life in danger. On Sunday, he resumed contact with CNN, offering an interview to ""anyone who would like to pay."" Monetary compensation for an interview is against CNN policy. Thursday, after the motion for a new trial was denied, State Attorney Angela Corey told CNN affiliate WJXT, ""(We) offered to take 17 years off of the 20-year mandatory ... I exercised that discretion and as late as the Friday before trial, before we were picking a jury on the following Monday, my two prosecutors were willing to let her take the three-year minimum mandatory,"" she said. ""The internet is filled with contentions that she fired a warning shot as she was being choked. Nothing could be further from the truth."" Alexander's sentencing hearing is scheduled for next Friday, but the proceeding is a formality -- the judge has no discretion because her 20-year sentence is mandatory. Her attorney, Kevin M. Cobbin, tells CNN he will continue his client's fight on appeal.","Marissa Alexander fired a gun in the air when her abusive husband threatened her .

"St. Louis (CNN) -- The funeral of slain Ferguson, Missouri, teenager Michael Brown was a celebration of his life, a search for meaning in his death and a battle cry to change policing in America. The Rev. Al Sharpton delivered one of two eulogies during the service Monday, and he had sharp words for those who looted stores and clashed with police after the teenager was shot. ""You don't understand that Michael Brown does not want to be remembered for a riot. He wants to be remembered as the one that made America deal with how we're going to police in the United States."" With a call to action, Sharpton criticized police who pointed rifles at peaceful protesters in Ferguson. ""We have to leave here today and change this,"" he said. He urged mourners at Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church to respect the Brown family's wish for silence Monday. And when protests resume, Sharpton said ""they've asked for it to be peaceful. If you can't control yourself, then don't do it in Michael's name. Do it in your own name."" Brown's great-uncle, the Rev. Charles Ewing, drew parallels between the teenager's life, death and Scripture during his eulogy on behalf of the family. ""Michael Brown's blood is crying from the ground, crying for vengeance, crying for justice,"" he said. ""There is a cry being made from the ground, not just for Michael Brown but for the Trayvon Martins, for those children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, for the Columbine massacre, for the black-on-black crime."" Family members and friends reflecting on their memories of ""Mike Mike"" recalled him saying, ""One day, the world will know my name."" ""Michael was a big guy, but he was a kind, gentle soul, and before he left this Earth, the day that he was killed, he was out spreading the word of Jesus Christ,"" a family friend said. They urged the crowd of thousands of mourners to ""show up at the voting polls,"" because ""we have had enough to of seeing our brothers and sisters killed in the streets."" ""If we had more of this,"" one family member said, referring to the audience and then motioning to Brown's casket, ""we could have less of this. It shouldn't have took this to get us together like this."" A message of hope to a full sanctuary . Bishop Edwin Bass of the Church of God in Christ told the Brown family that he, too, lost a child to violence on the streets of St. Louis. ""While this tragic loss will always be with you, the step-by-step, one foot in front of the other march of time will ultimately bring you to a divine place where you will laugh again, you will find the joy of living again, as your thinking shifts from tragedy to the joyful reflection of good times."" Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, wiped away tears as she stood at the coffin that holds her son's body. She wrote a letter to her son published in the funeral program that said in part, ""I never want this to go unsaid, there are no words to express how much you mean to me. A son like you, I thought could never be. Because the day you were born, I just know, God sent me a blessing -- and that was you."" His father, Michael Brown Sr., wrote his own letter, saying, ""I always told you I will never let nothing happen to you. And that's what hurt sooooooo much, that I couldn't protect you but we love you. I will never let you die in my heart, you will always live forever."" The sanctuary, which holds 2,500 people, was filled, and an overflow auditorium was also full. It was estimated by reporters at the service that another 2,000 people were on church property for the funeral in addition to those in the sanctuary. Retired mail carrier Hilliard Phillips, who once delivered on the street where Brown was killed, was among the mourners. He said there's power in numbers, and he hoped the outpouring of support for Brown and his family would spur society to take a look at itself. ""You can't really overnight change the behavior of a person, but sometimes they can be coerced in a sweet way. ... I would hope they could see people coming together in a solemn way to show their respect to someone,"" he said. Following the service, scores of motorcycles ridden by mourners accompanied the funeral procession that carried Brown's body to St. Peter's Cemetery in St. Louis. T-shirts and buttons memorializing Michael Brown . Brown's death on August 9 sparked days of sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis suburb and concern over race and police shootings across the country. In the past several days, things have calmed down, and the town is slowly coming back to life. Among the guests at the service were Martin Luther King III and the Rev. Bernice King; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; the families of Trayvon Martin and Sean Bell; and celebrities Spike Lee, Diddy and Snoop Lion. The White House sent three officials to the funeral. One of them was Broderick Johnson, who leads the White House's My Brother's Keeper Task Force. He was joined by Marlon Marshall, a St. Louis native who attended high school with Brown's mother, and Heather Foster. Marshall and Foster are part of the White House Office of Public Engagement. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, however, did not attend. ""The governor has communicated to attorneys representing the family of Michael Brown that he will not be attending today's funeral out of respect for the family, who deserve time to focus on remembering Michael and grieving their loss,"" spokesman Scott Holste said before the service. A tense tranquility . One sign of a return to normality: Children in the Ferguson-Florissant School District finally started school Monday. The first day had been scheduled for August 18 but was delayed a week because of looting and protests, reported CNN affiliate KMOV. Two weeks after the shooting sparked violent protests, the mood turned more tranquil over the weekend, with smaller crowds and lots of music. Gone were police in riot gear and defiant protesters. The tear gas, rubber bullets and Molotov cocktails were nowhere to be seen, either. In their place were clusters of officers, hanging around businesses, chatting with one another. Race has been at the forefront of the tensions; Brown was African-American, and the officer who shot him is white. Two investigations -- one federal and one run by state prosecutors -- are in the early stages of trying to determine what led up to the shooting. Investigators are grappling with witness statements that include shifting and contradictory stories, and some who appear to be reciting accounts of what they've seen in the media, two law enforcement sources told CNN.

"Holy backlash, Batman! Warner Bros. announced Thursday that Ben Affleck will play Batman in the sequel to the Superman movie ""Man of Steel."" Rumors about who'll star as the Caped Crusader in the yet-to-be-named film have been swirling ever since ""Man of Steel"" director Zack Snyder announced at Comic-Con last month that the two superheroes would appear together in the sequel -- their first pairing on the big screen. Affleck's name wasn't even on The Hollywood Reporter's list of possible Batmans two weeks ago, when it speculated Ryan Gosling or Josh Brolin were likely candidates. Needless to say, the Internet went nuts -- and not in a good way. Are the worries justified? Affleck's stint as Daredevil was a major flop. Plus, he's just getting his movie street cred back from that other disaster, ""Gigli."" But he has numerous awards to his name and received critical raves for his role as Superman star George Reeves in ""Hollywoodland."" Affleck will star opposite British actor Henry Cavill, who Warner Bros. said will reprise his role as Clark Kent and Superman. Affleck as Batman? 'No, nyet, never!' Snyder's reimagining of Superman in ""Man of Steel"" broke the record for the biggest June opening when it appeared in theaters this year, taking in $125.1 million in its first weekend. ""It's beyond mythological to have Superman and our new Batman facing off, since they are the greatest superheroes in the world,"" Snyder said at Comic-Con. Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne and Diane Lane also return for the new film, Warner Bros. said. Christian Bale, who starred as Batman in three film installments of ""The Dark Knight,"" told CNN partner Entertainment Weekly last month that he wouldn't be starring in a fourth. ""Dark Knight"" director Christopher Nolan also said he wasn't opting for a fourth movie in the franchise, the magazine said. Nolan will, however, have a hand in the upcoming Superman-Batman film -- he's serving as one of the executive producers, Warner Bros. said.

"(CNN) -- Sid Meier is the director of creative development at Firaxis Games. But to millions, he's better known as the ""Father of Computer Gaming."" Now, the designer of ""Civilization"" is ready to take over a completely new world -- social gaming on the pages of Facebook. ""Civilization"" is one of the most popular computer strategy games of all time, and has spawned several versions and updates over the past 20 years. The game allows players to build and develop their own cities, countries and civilizations across the expanse of time. It has sold millions of copies and drawn in fans from around the world who are involved, vocal and loyal. From its beginning in 1991 to its most recent edition, last year's ""Civilization V,"" Meier said it has been a strong, connected community that has kept the game strong. ""Players have continued to respond to the game in spite of how far technology has come, in spite of how the world has changed, in spite of how the demographics of game players have changed,"" Meier said. ""Each game starts out in a brand new world (and is) probably going to go off in a different direction than your last game. You've never really exhausted the possibilities of the game."" While the game primarily has remained a PC game over the years, Meier took his creation to consoles in 2008 with ""Civilization Revolution."" The game retained many of the PC version's features, but made them available to a new set of fans -- those who enjoy console and mobile gaming. ""We've seen console games getting more strategic, having more depth. It felt like, both in terms of the technology and also where players were, that they would respond to having a strategy type game on their console."" Fans and critics who enjoyed the fast playability and ease of control warmly received the game. Long-time fans bemoaned the simplicity of the console version, but it won 2008's Best Strategy Game award from the British Academy Video Games Awards. Now, Meier is ready to take to the pages of Facebook with an incarnation of the franchise called ""Civilization World."" Developers hope to have the game up and running this summer. ""It's been the most dramatic stretch for the game, I'd have to say, so far,"" he said. ""We really weren't looking to make a quote-unquote 'Facebook game',"" he said. ""We were looking at what does Facebook bring us that is unique, that we can leverage and take advantage of with 'Civilization'-style game play."" Meier said there were things that a Facebook game can offer Civ players over a traditional PC game. Connections with friends and a world with potentially hundreds of millions of players provided fuel for the development team to re-imagine the classic strategy game. ""What was really intriguing to us was being able to emphasize cooperative game play, which was something that really hadn't been a major part of 'Civilization' up to now,"" he said. ""A lot of our design in 'Civ World' was taking advantage and using these opportunities for players to work together -- teamwork, communication, planning. Those are all the things that become really important to 'Civ World.'"" Meier points out that a typical ""Civilization"" multiplayer game can easily span 12 or more continuous hours, whereas a Facebook game will take place in stops and starts over days and week. He said pacing and having to work with other people would be the biggest adjustments for PC ""Civilization"" players. Playing at different times in the day, Meier said, ""fundamentally changes the mechanics of the game because if you are not there at the same time as other players, there needs to be ways of leaving messages, ways of communicating Things have to happen at a pace where everybody can be included. So that fundamentally changes the pacing and the mechanisms of the game."" Meier said all the game's traditional pieces -- science, economy, military, culture -- will be in ""Civilization World."" ""You can do those things yourself but you'll be most effective -- science, for example -- if a couple of people are researching the same technology then that technology will be discovered more quickly and you can all use it."" In the Facebook game, a world will consist of 200 people, all vying for supremacy. The goal remains the same as previous ""Civilization"" games -- to build an empire that will stand the test of time. ""You have your own city to manage and you can do all kinds of stuff (on your own),"" Meier said. ""However, the most successful players will be those that can also work together with other players."" Unlike other Facebook games (oh, let's say ""Farmville""), ""Civilization World"" will have a beginning and an end. Players who succeed will be rewarded, and then another game can start. The game will also look different from its PC counterparts. ""We're dealing with Flash. We're dealing with browsers, dealing with kind of a whole different technology than we are with PCs. It is not your standard PC 'Civ' look by any means."" He said designing a Facebook game does give them the ability to update things really quickly because players are essentially downloading the whole game every time they play. He said they will be taking a look at feedback and making adjustments and providing new stuff frequently. Meier says he's excited about the prospects of social gaming, but thinks its full potential hasn't yet been reached. ""The future is really out there, but I think we are at the very beginning of exploring the possibilities of social gaming,"" he said. ""It is not like I can see the end and know where this is going."" He said that, ultimately, gamers will decide whether social gaming will stand the test of time alongside consoles and PCs. ""It's just one more place to experience games,"" he said. ""Games are really taking over the world.""","Sid Meier designed ""Civilization,"" one of the most popular computer strategy games ever .

"Model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen is usually one of Twitter's more resilient members. But after getting lost in a ""sea of hate and anger"" on the platform, Teigen has tapped out. The 28-year-old turned into a Twitter all-star after she joined in 2009, thanks to her irreverent sense of humor, prolific use and ability to tweet about pretty much anything. But after getting a vitriolic response to her comments regarding the October 22 shootings in Ottawa, Ontario, Teigen posted that she's quitting Twitter for the (presumably) safer pastures of Instagram. Here's what started it all: On Wednesday, as the shooting story unfolded, Teigen posted: ""active shooting in Canada, or as we call it in america, wednesday. That's not a joke. It is a fact. ... I've lost faith in this world. Sorry if it comes off as being unemotional. There is just so much bad."" It seems the negative reaction fell on Teigen pretty quickly, as she then had to clarify that she was not making a joke at the expense of Canada, but as a sardonic observation about gun control in America. (Incidentally, it was just days before the Marysville, Washington, school shooting.) However, that clarification apparently didn't change the tide of response Teigen received. ""You should probably stick to having your picture taken for a living,"" replied one user. ""So, how much of an stupid bitch are you?"" asked another. At one point, Teigen posted a photo of the responses she was getting on Twitter, suggesting the platform should be more proactive about stomping out threatening tweets. By October 23, Teigen was officially over Twitter. ""I can't see anything through the sea of hate and anger that is now my Twitter. Seriously I can't sift through it all,"" Teigen said. ""It's gotten to the point people don't even see (t)he simplicity of the original tweet and have just wanted to get shaking-mad over something."" After sharing one more threatening message, this time from a Twitter user who hoped that ""someone murders some(one) you love, like your f****t husband,"" Teigen posted what sounds like her final tweet -- at least for now.

"A new investigation into the death of singer Amy Winehouse found that she died of accidental alcohol poisoning, authorities in London said Tuesday. The conclusion was the same as that of an earlier investigation, which had to be thrown out because the coroner did not have the right qualifications. The Grammy Award-winning artist, who had battled with alcohol and drug abuse for several years, was found dead at her north London home on July 23, 2011, at age 27. The new inquest was ordered in December by the London borough of Camden. Dr Shirley Radcliffe, interim coroner for Inner North London, gave a verdict of ""death by misadventure"" Tuesday, meaning the death is judged to be accidental, with no law broken and no criminal negligence involved. Winehouse ""had a history of excessive alcohol ingestion for some years and was under the care of a number of physicians,"" Radcliffe told the court, according to a summary provided by Camden Council. ""She had had a period of abstinence from alcohol for 12-13 days in July but a few days before her death she began to drink alcohol again. ""Following her death the police attended and deemed the death to be non-suspicious. Toxicological analysis revealed a level of alcohol commonly associated with fatality."" The original coroner, Suzanne Greenaway, lost her position as assistant deputy coroner, to which she was appointed by her husband, London Coroner Andrew Reid, after it was discovered that she had not been a registered lawyer in the United Kingdom for the requisite five years. A life cut short: Remembering the tragedy of Amy Winehouse . Greenaway's report also concluded that Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning, in a ""death by misadventure."" A pathologist told Greenaway's court that Winehouse's blood-alcohol level was 416 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood. The level considered lethal is 350 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood, and the legal limit to drive in Britain is 80 milligrams of alcohol. The pathologist found no traces of tablets in Winehouse's stomach and said her organs appeared to be normal. The singer's soulful, throaty vocals brought her stardom in 2007, but her troubled off-stage life -- chronicled in her top 10 hit ""Rehab"" -- won her notoriety. Her death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks after she was booed offstage by disappointed fans in Serbia. The tattooed London-born singer-songwriter's first album, ""Frank,"" debuted in 2003, when she was 19. International success came with her 2007 album ""Back to Black."" She dominated the 2008 Grammys, winning five awards that night and delivering, via satellite from London, a strong performance of ""Rehab.""

"House Speaker John Boehner flatly denied Tuesday that congressional Republicans are moving to impeach President Barack Obama, blasting talk about it as ""a scam started by Democrats at the White House."" ""We have no plans to impeach the President. We have no future plans,"" Boehner told reporters after a weekly meeting with GOP members. Boehner said ""this whole talk about impeachment"" comes from ""the President's own staff"" and from congressional Democrats. ""Why? Because they're trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year's elections,"" he said. Boehner has emphasized several times publicly that he disagrees with former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and other conservatives pushing impeachment over their claims Obama's grossly exceeded his executive authority. A recent CNN-ORC opinion poll shows that almost two thirds of Americans do not believe Obama deserves to be impeached. In that same poll, however, a partisan split shows that 57% of Republicans support such a step, while 86% of Democrats and 63% of Independents don't. White House: Game on . Boehner's decision to sue Obama was designed to address outrage from tea party activists and others within the GOP base over a string of Obama executive orders they say circumvented Congress. The lawsuit covers his decision last year to defer a health law requirement that businesses provide insurance coverage to their employees. But the suit also opened the door to more discussion about impeaching the second-straight Democratic president by a Republican-led House. The issue was magnified when incoming House GOP whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana refused to take the issue off the table during an interview over the weekend. Dan Pfeiffer, a longtime aide and senior Obama adviser said last week that impeachment talk should not be considered a long shot. ""I would not discount that possibility,"" Pfeiffer said. Pfeiffer said that the lawsuit was evidence Republicans would consider impeachment down the road. Congressional Democrats have seized on the issue and show no sign of letting up. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid raised the subject on the Senate floor on Tuesday at about the same time Boehner was ruling it out. ""Look in the papers today, the American people are totally opposed to this,"" Reid said. ""We shouldn't be off on those tracks of impeachment and suing the President. We should be legislating."" In the month since Boehner announced his lawsuit, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has raised nearly $7.6 million ahead of the November midterms. But the campaign arm has pulled in $1 million alone since Scalise's comments on impeachment over the weekend. With the resolution to formally authorize the lawsuit expected on the House floor on Wednesday, House Democrats are likely to continue to argue, regardless of Boehner's comments, that that move is simply the first step toward impeachment.

Maybe he's listening, because Kojima plans to go in a new direction with his next big project. ""The kind of game I'm making is some game that has a very wide entrance, a very open entrance,"" Kojima said through a translator in a phone interview with CNN last week. ""Rather than making something very cinematic, [I plan to] make something very free."" Among gamers worldwide, and especially in Japan where Kojima Productions and publisher Konami are based, Kojima is treated like a rock star. Often dressed in a slick leather jacket, he gets swarmed by fans at conventions, and people pick apart his every word and tweet for clues about the next secret-agent action game in the ""Metal Gear"" series. One such Twitter frenzy broke out a few days ago when Kojima posted pictures from a mysterious war game to his 131,000 followers. He wrote that the images demonstrate some of the advancements made in game-development software, made by his team, that allow for translucent clothing, realistic dust particles and other fancy effects. The pictures are set in a sandy, mountainous region, perhaps somewhere in the Middle East, with soldiers and tanks. They do not look quite like a ""Metal Gear"" game, which have led many fans to speculate that this is the first peek at Kojima's next big thing. Kojima has called his upcoming game Project Ogre. In the interview, he described it as being set in a very open world where players can wander around and explore freely. Players should still be able to find new sights and worthwhile adventures after having played the game for as many as 100 hours, he said. By contrast, recent ""Metal Gear"" games have followed very linear paths, going back to the original on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987. For example, ""Metal Gear Solid 4"" for the PlayStation 3 takes players from Afghanistan to Alaska in a lengthy, action-packed, professionally narrated story, but there is little room to stray from the trail. People do not quite know what to expect from ""Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance,"" next year's game, which was developed by an outside studio with less direction from Kojima. In a recent interview with the UK's Official PlayStation Magazine, Kojima described Project Ogre's tone as ""subdued,"" and the experience as similar on the surface but essentially different from his past projects. Project Ogre will not be completed for some time, and Kojima will continue to produce other games, he said.","""Metal Gear"" creator Hideo Kojima is working on a less cinematic game .

"(CNN) -- This is Linda DeRegnaucourt's last summer off. When school starts in August, it will be her last year to think about high school classes, advanced placement tests and calculus. If all goes as planned, this will be her last year teaching at Palm Bay High School in Brevard County, Florida. She doesn't want to go. After 13 years of teaching high-level math, she has a tested stable of learning methods that helped all her students pass the AP calculus exam. Her room is a popular place for students to escape the drama of the high school cafeteria. Few jobs can indulge her excitement for linear functions and matrix calculus. ""I hate to have to leave it,"" DeRegnaucourt said. ""I really thought I was going to be that teacher, 65 years old and retiring from the education field. That's not going to happen."" She's quitting, she said, because she can't afford to stay. Two years ago, a divorce left 47-year-old DeRegnaucourt with a single income. Rental properties she owned only caused more financial strain as Florida's real estate market fell apart in recent years. Despite her years of experience, she earns $38,000, she said, less than she made in the past, when teachers received larger supplements for additional certifications. Once she made a budget, she realized she didn't make enough money to cover her expenses and save for her future. Changing careers felt like the only wise financial move, she said. DeRegnaucourt isn't the only one. Attracting the best students to teaching -- and keeping them -- is tough for schools across the country. Average starting teaching salaries are $39,000, and rise with experience to an average of $54,000, according to ""Closing the Talent Gap,"" a 2010 report by McKinsey & Company. Teacher salaries can't compete with other careers, the report said, and annual teacher turnover in the United States is 14%. At ""high-needs"" high schools, it is 20%. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development data from 2007 said the United States ranks 20th out of 29 for starting teacher salaries, and 23rd out of 29 for teacher salaries after 15 years. But it's not just the pay, DeRegnaucourt said, ""It's the way we're treated."" Her colleagues have waited until just before school starts to learn what courses they'll be teaching, she said. Uncertainty makes it impossible to prepare, hard to succeed. ""Five years ago, 10 years ago, kids would ask me, should they become teachers? I was like, 'Oh, God, yes, I love what I do,' "" she said. ""Now, I tell my kids, 'You're really, really bright. Why don't you think about going into (this or that?)' They have the potential to be doctors, lawyers, nurses, CEOs and scientists . Why would I recommend to my kids, who I absolutely love, to struggle for years?"" This year, she's finishing the prerequisite courses needed to enroll in nursing school. DeRegnaucourt hopes to spend a couple of more years learning, then work in emergency care nursing to gain experience. ""It's challenging,"" she said, ""but there's not a whole lot that's more challenging than doing upper level mathematics."" Here's what DeRegnaucourt had to say about her decision to leave teaching. CNN: Why did you go into teaching? DeRegnaucourt: When my son was 6 years old, the school system that he was in in Georgia, it did not allow the teacher to take her planning days unless she could find a volunteer sub. She had to ask for parental volunteers. I told her at the beginning of the year, 'I work at night. I'll take every single one of your days. I can substitute for you.' I really enjoyed working with the kids. Then I read an article in the paper, and it said that (most) boys get the same educations as their mothers. I had not gone to college. I wanted my son to be college educated. It was time for me to go back to school. I knew that math was an area where I would never, ever worry about getting a job as a teacher. If you're in math or physics or chemistry, you can write your own ticket. CNN: Had you always been interested in math? DeRegnaucourt: I was not a good student in high school. I really needed a teacher to take me under their wing and go ""Look, you have potential."" I didn't have that teacher. I missed a lot of school. You can't be good at math unless you are present to learn it. When I went back to school, my first math class was pre-pre-college math ... you didn't even get a grade for it, you just got pass or fail. I remember starting in negative numbers; I never even knew negative numbers existed, except in my checking account. Whatever I did learn in high school, I had forgotten. I was 29 years old. I had been out of school for 11 years. I had a teacher for developmental math named Ms. Sifton, and she was amazing. Out of my entire career, she was the best math professor I ever had. I loved math. CNN: Did that influence how you teach? DeRegnaucourt: I didn't take Ms. Sifton for granted. The way she made it so elemental, and gave me that strong base to go ahead and succeed. What I have found is most people aren't awful at math, even if math is not your strength. You can be successful, given the right mentor. It definitely influenced the way I teach. I have always had a very open relationship with my students. I don't believe I deserve respect because I'm older. I deserve it because I've earned it, and you deserve it because you've earned it. The majority of the really, really amazing techniques I have came from students. I worked summers for years. I taught a six-week class where students could either remediate or jump ahead. You taught it for an eight-hour day. I had a young man, Victor Rodriguez. He came up to me, ""Ms. D, we're just learning and learning and learning. We're just forgetting and forgetting and forgetting. We need to practice it."" I asked ""What do you think we should do?"" He said, ""I think we need to go to the boards."" Every day, except on test days, my kids go to the board (to work math problems in front of each other). If they finish and they get it right, I give them a thumbs up and they go help another student. The best teaching technique I have -- it came from Victor Rodriguez. CNN: Why did you decide to leave teaching? DeRegnaucourt: I have had to learn how to budget. In those thoughts, I came to the realization that the money I make isn't enough. It isn't enough to live alone. That realization was daunting. As educators, we make what we make, nothing more, nothing less. In industry, if I'm valuable, my company can keep me by making the package they offer me more attractive. In education, the principal's hands are tied. You just never know what the future holds. I still need to plan for the future. CNN: Why did you choose nursing? DeRegnaucourt: I'm happiest when I feel like I'm making a difference in another individual's life. There are other things I could do. I could take actuarial exams. I could easily pass those; it's math. Do I want to be an actuary, doing risk assessment for an insurance company with no human contact? No, thank you. What's really amazing is that nurses, with a two-year degree, make $20,000 more than I do. CNN: How did your students react when they learned this would be your last year teaching? DeRegnaucourt: My students were the first ones to know. One student comes to mind: Just the other day, he e-mailed and asked me to call him. He wanted to confirm again I would be there next year. The ones who were leaving, they don't care. I've already done for them what I needed to do. My juniors moving up to calculus, they were distraught. They know I know what I'm doing. They know what it's like to have a teacher who doesn't know what they're doing. They've all had bad teachers. We all have. CNN: What do you hope your students take away from their time in your classes? DeRegnaucourt: Kids come into my classroom, and everyone thinks they're all math geeks. They're not. I have so many kids who take my class because they want the calculus credit for college, but they're not the kind of kid who could go to a college calculus class and meet with success. I want them to get a love not of mathematics, just knowledge, just learning. I want them to always remember how anything was possible.","After a successful 13-year teaching career, Linda DeRegnaucourt plans to quit.
She earns about $38,000 per year -- too little to cover expenses, she says .
Nationally, attracting the best students to teaching is hard because of low pay.

"(CNN)  -- Tim Cahill scored twice as Australia opened their Asian Cup campaign with a convincing 4-0 win over India in their Group C match in Doha Monday. South Korea, like Australia one of the favorites to win the tournament, later beat Bahrain 2-1 to join the Socceroos at the head of the standings. Everton star Cahill opened the scoring in the 11th minute as he netted at the near post after a fine cross from Brett Emerton. Galatasaray's Harry Kewell doubled the advantage with a fine long-range strike midway through the half, his 14th goal for the Socceroos. Emerton laid on the third just before halftime with another cross from the right which was met by the head of Brett Holman. In-depth guide to the Asian Cup . India battled hard to limit their losses, but Cahill added the fourth after the break as he rose well to head home his second from a pinpoint cross by Luke Wilkshire. It was a convincing start for Holger Osieck's men, who fluffed their opening lines with a goalless draw in their first appearance in the Asia Cup four years ago against Oman. They also lost to eventual winners Iraq before going out to Japan on penalties in the quarterfinals. ""It was very important to get a good start, to find our rhythm, to get a performance together,"" Osieck told AFP.

"TEMPE, Arizona (CNN)  -- President Obama on Wednesday turned a flap over his commencement speech at Arizona State University into a joke -- then a lesson about never being satisfied with one's accomplishments. President Obama addresses the graduating class at Arizona State University on Wednesday. The university said last month that it would not be awarding Obama an honorary degree at the ceremony, saying that ""his body of work is yet to come."" Saying he wanted to address ""the little controversy everyone was talking about a few weeks back,"" Obama said, ""we all learned an important lesson."" ""I learned to never again pick another team over the Sun Devils in my NCAA bracket,"" he said, referring to the school's basketball team. ""It won't happen again."" ""President [Michael] Crow and the board of regents will soon learn all about being audited by the IRS,"" he joked.  Watch Obama speak at ASU » . The university said no offense was intended. The school eventually announced that it was expanding its most important scholarship program and naming it the President Barack Obama Scholars program. Obama said he didn't want to dispute the suggestion that he hasn't achieved enough in life. ""I come to embrace it, to heartily concur, to affirm that one's title -- even a title like president -- says very little about how well one's life has been led,"" he said. ""That no matter how much you've done, or how successful you've been, there's always more to do, more to learn, more to achieve."" He called the milestone of graduating from college an important one but urged the graduating students to not rest on their laurels. ""Your body of work is yet to come,"" he said. Obama urged the graduates to reject ""the greed and irresponsibility that rippled out from Wall Street and Washington,"" contributing to the nation's economic troubles. He urged them, instead, to pursue a ""bigger purpose"" -- through service and a principled approach to their professions. ""That other stuff, the trappings of success may be a byproduct of this larger mission, but it can't be the central thing,"" Obama said. ""Just ask Bernie Madoff."" He acknowledged that this year's graduates will be entering the job market at an uncertain time, calling it both a challenge and a privilege. ""Because it is moments like these that force us to try harder, and dig deeper, and to discover gifts we never knew we had -- to find the greatness that lies within each of us,"" Obama said. Wednesday's address was the first commencement speech Obama has delivered since becoming president. He is scheduled to give the commencement address at Notre Dame University on May 17. That speech also has stirred controversy, with some at the Catholic school protesting the invitation to Obama because of his stances on abortion rights and stem-cell research.","President Obama addresses graduating class at Arizona State University .

"Police missed speaking with suspected Los Angeles International Airport shooter Paul Ciancia by ""a matter of minutes"" the day his family asked authorities to check on him after receiving disturbing messages, according to the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. By the time officers arrived at Ciancia's apartment Friday, he had already left -- as little as 45 minutes earlier -- for the airport, according to U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul. As authorities piece together Ciancia's actions leading up to the shooting, new details emerged Sunday from those close to the suspect. According to someone who knew Ciancia and his roommates well, Ciancia began asking one of his three roommates days before the shooting if he could get a ride to the airport. Ciancia told the roommate that his father, back in New Jersey, was sick and he needed to get home ""to go help take care of him,"" the source said. Ciancia didn't, however, indicate what day he needed to leave. On the day of the shooting, Ciancia burst into his roommate's room and demanded a ride to the airport immediately, said the source, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity. ""That morning he doesn't knock. He just opens the door and says, 'I need to leave. Can you take me now?'"" the source said. The roommate, who investigators believe didn't know about any shooting plot, dropped him off at the airport, a law enforcement official said. Texts alarmed family . Meanwhile, his family back in New Jersey had been receiving alarming texts from Ciancia, indicating he was unhappy, according to an intelligence source with knowledge of the investigation. It was one of those text messages that made his family think something bad was about to happen. ""Basically, the text message was just a message to the little brother, and the way it was written, they had some concern about it, and that's when they brought it to our attention,"" said Allen Cummings, the police chief in Ciancia's hometown of Pennsville, New Jersey. The father called Cummings about 1:30 p.m. ET on Friday. Cummings, in turn, called the Los Angeles Police Department, asking them to check on him to make sure he was OK. When they checked, he wasn't home. His two other roommates were sleeping, unaware of where he and the fourth roommate had gone. The next thing Cummings heard, he said, were media reports linking Ciancia to the shooting. McCaul, R-Texas, called the timing ""tragic."" ""This is how we typically stop these things -- through good intelligence, and if family members or friends see a loved one who is exhibiting signs of mental illness ... then I think it's incumbent to call this to local authorities,"" McCaul said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union. ""They actually did that in this case and, unfortunately, missed the suspect by a matter of minutes."" Ciancia, 23, remained ""unresponsive"" Sunday, according to a law enforcement source, recovering from multiple gunshot wounds he suffered after airport police confronted him inside Terminal 3. He is in critical condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, the hospital said. He is unable to speak, the source said, leaving many questions as to why he allegedly walked into the airport shortly after 9 a.m. Friday. pulled out an assault rifle and opened fire. 'Conscious decision to kill ... TSA employees' Even in Ciancia's silence, more details are trickling out about what happened at the bustling airport. The incident began when Ciancia walked up to a security checkpoint and shot a TSA officer ""at point-blank range,"" according to an affidavit accompanying the criminal complaint against him. He then went up an escalator and, upon seeing the officer apparently continue to move, came back down to shoot him again, the affidavit said. That TSA officer, Gerardo Hernandez, later died. After shooting Hernandez, the gunman continued through the terminal, firing on two other uniformed TSA officers and a passenger before he was shot by airport police, U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said. The gunman had a note that indicated the suspect made a ""conscious decision to kill multiple TSA employees,"" according to the affidavit. The note also apparently referred to the New World Order and anti-government claims, a federal law enforcement official said. It's not clear what gave rise to the references, and federal investigators have found no links to known groups and nothing in the suspect's background to explain them. The New World Order is generally considered to be a conspiracy theory in which people suspect a group of elites is conspiring to form an authoritarian, one-world government. ""He addressed them (TSA officers) at one point in the letter and stated that he wanted to 'instill fear into their traitorous minds,'"" FBI Special Agent in Charge David Bowdich said. In his diatribe, the gunman claimed the TSA treats Americans like terrorists even though all people aren't equally dangerous, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Sources: Alleged shooter hated government, 'New World Order' Opinion: Arming TSA officers not the answer . Wounded victims identified . Both wounded TSA officers were treated and released from hospitals. The TSA identified them Sunday as James Speer, 54, and Tony Grigsby, 36. The passenger who was shot in his leg was still being treated Sunday at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center Sunday, according to a hospital statement. Brian Ludmer ""remains in fair condition but faces at least one additional surgery for a fractured leg along with extensive physical therapy,"" a hospital spokesman said Sunday. Ludmer, a 29-year-old Lake Forest, Illinois, native, teaches stage craft in the theater program at Calabasas High School in Los Angeles County, according to the school's website. Ciancia is now charged with two felony offenses -- murder of a federal officer and commission of violence in an international airport. If convicted, Ciancia could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, the prosecutor said. The U.S. attorney general would decide whether to pursue a death sentence. 'A wonderful husband, father' Hernandez is the first TSA officer to die in the line of duty since the agency was founded in 2001. He was working as a travel document checker at the time, the TSA workers' union said. He would have turned 40 next week. His widow described him as a ""wonderful husband, father, brother, son and friend."" Remembering Gerardo Hernandez . The chaos also affected more than 165,000 passengers on hundreds of flights as the airport shut down for hours. By Saturday afternoon, all of it -- including Terminal 3 -- had been reopened. Placement of police questioned . The shooting has stirred questions about a recent repositioning of airport police officers around LAX. Airport police Chief Patrick Gannon said in the past year, he decided to move officers from behind a TSA security checkpoint to in front of it, where they also took on ""greater responsibilities"" such as monitoring both the arrival and departure floors of the terminal. ""The threat ... at the airport does not exist behind security at that podium, the threat exists from the curbline on,"" Gannon said. ""So ... we have our people stationed throughout the airport."" He said the nearest police officer to the site of Friday's initial shooting ""was just moved to the front part of the airport."" Gannon acknowledged the trade-off of having the officers roam a larger area rather than sit at a checkpoint. ""So are they going to be in the exact same (place), exactly where I'd hoped they would be? No,"" he said. ""It didn't happen in this particular case."" TSA Administrator John Pistole said the shooting has prompted a review of security protocol with partner agencies. TSA: Number of guns discovered in airports rising . Congressman speaks out . McCaul said better coordination between TSA officers and local law enforcement at the nation's airports could help improve security at those locations. ""I talked to the director of TSA, John Pistole, yesterday. We talked about a review of the policies at airports. Every airport is a little bit different, but the coordination with the local police is key because remember, TSA officers are not armed,"" he said. ""I think it's important we have the local law enforcement really at different points at the airport to protect not only the perimeter, but also things that could happen through security checkpoint,"" he said. He also talked about the importance of using special TSA VIPR teams, short for Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response. The teams are tasked with performing random, unpredictable baggage and security checks at transportation venues. McCaul said Pistole wants to further the use of such teams at airports ""to make sure American people are safe and the traveling public are safe when they go to our airports. I think that better coordination with local law enforcement should help tremendously. ""However, having said that, it's very difficult to stop these types of attacks. Anybody can show up, as we saw in the Navy Yard with the shotgun."" He was referring to the September attack at the Navy Yard in Washington. ""It's almost like an open shopping mall,"" he said, ""so very difficult to protect.""","Paul Ciancia began asking for a ride to the airport days before the shooting .

"The sweat-stained sheets of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, still on her bed, a woman quarantined in a Dallas apartment said Thursday that she desperately wants her family's nightmare to end. ""We can't wait to be over with everything,"" the woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Louise, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""We can't wait."" While Duncan is in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, his partner and three others have been stuck in a Dallas apartment since his diagnosis this week. Louise told CNN that authorities had her sign paperwork stating ""if we step outside, they are going to take us ... to court (because) we'll have committed a crime."" So there she has stayed, along with her 13-year-old son and two nephews in their 20s. But it hasn't been easy. Louise told CNN's Cooper by phone that she is checking her temperature every hour, and based on that and everything else, isn't sick. She expressed frustration being confined nonetheless, since people are only contagious with Ebola if they are symptomatic. Duncan's girlfriend has been frustrated in other ways as well. She said no one brought food Thursday to four people who can't leave to get it themselves, at least until later in the day. There was also the matter of their power going out, which was likely related to strong storms that rolled through the area. Then, of course, there's the idea of living in a place that -- just a few days ago -- was home to an Ebola sufferer. Her 35-year-old daughter brought over Clorox to help clean the house, and she sealed up Duncan's dirty clothes and towels in a bag. ""But (authorities) said we shouldn't throw anything away until they can get back with me,"" Louise said. That hadn't happened as of Thursday evening. Men in trucks from Cleaning Guys, a company that specializes in hazmat and biohazard cleaning services, was turned away for lack of the necessary permit to transport hazardous waste on Texas highways, it said. Once everything is cleaned up, even if plenty of food arrives, Louise's ordeal is far from over. First off, there's the fact Duncan -- who flew from Liberia to visit her and family members -- is still in the hospital, fighting a disease that's already killed thousands in West Africa. And Louise, her son and her nephews must wait 21 days from when Duncan first showed symptoms before they can leave the apartment. That's because Ebola can be in a person for that long before it manifests itself, and someone starts to feel sick. Reflecting on it all, Louise said Thursday, ""I'm just hanging in there, depending on God to save our lives."" County official: Quarantined four should be relocated . If it were up to the Dallas County director of homeland security, the four people quarantined shouldn't be stuck in the apartment at all. Judge Clay Jenkins, also director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said officials are working on that relocation after Duncan's partner told CNN of being forced to live with distressing living conditions. Jenkins acknowledged ""some hygiene issues"" in the apartment. ""I would like to see those people moved to better living conditions,"" Jenkins told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday afternoon. ""We are working on that. I would like to move them five minutes ago."" Jenkins acknowledged problems with Louise's apartment but defended the overall government response. ""We have some hygiene issues that we are addressing in that apartment,"" Jenkins said earlier in the day. ""Those people in the apartment are part of Dallas County, and they're going to be treated with utmost respect and dignity in this unusual situation. ""We are working to get the response, which has been a good response, strengthened every hour of the day,"" the judge said. Partner: Hospital staff told Duncan from Liberia . Louise, a caregiver, sometimes refers to Duncan as her husband -- even though they're not legally married -- CNN's Cooper said. When Duncan arrived in the United States on September 20, ""he didn't tell me that he came in contact with anybody with Ebola,"" Louise said. Nor was he showing any signs of the virus. But things changed three days later, when Duncan got a headache and a fever, according to his partner. On September 25, she took him to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where, Louise said, hospital staff were told twice that Duncan had come from Liberia. But ""they did not ask"" him anything about Ebola, including whether he'd had contact with anyone with the disease in Africa, according to Louise. Duncan was taken by ambulance to the hospital on Sunday, September 28, after Louise's 35-year-old daughter saw him ""shaking really hard"" and with a fever when she came by to give him tea. Louise said she went to the hospital herself soon thereafter, seeing Duncan ""through the glass."" It was then that health officials first told her that medical officials first told her that her partner may have Ebola. ""I was so (scared),"" Louise said. Your Ebola questions answered . Did authorities drop the ball? So, too, is Peterson Wayne. But Wayne doesn't want his 13-year-old son, who is the youngest person quarantined in the apartment of his mother, Louise -- to know that what he's feeling. So every time they talk on the phone, Wayne said he want ""just to encourage him,"" not to frighten him. ""I believe he knows everything,"" said Wayne, who is no longer with the boy's mother but is still pulling for her. ""(There's) no need for me to just go and talk about Ebola."" Wilfred Smallwood, Duncan's half-brother, said his 21-year-old son is also among those quarantined in Louise's apartment, where he lived. He said that Duncan had come to Texas to ""help his son"" and visit his family. Asked about health authorities have handled the quarantine, including the sweat-stained sheets and lack of food, Smallwood conceded that he's ""skeptical."" ""That worries me now, yes."" He's not alone. Dr. Irwin Redlener, a professor at Columbia University's school of public health, called the handling of the quarantine ""hair raising."" ""If, in fact, there was a health worker there every day, what exactly were they doing other than just taking her temperature and leaving?"" Redlener said. ""It should have been a whole lot more that (Louse) should be expecting."" Ebola only spreads through infected bodily fluids. And it's distinctly possible that no one around Duncan got exposed to his. (Louise said she didn't think she had.) Still, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said the continuing presence of the sheets, on which Duncan may have transmitted the virus through sweating, are disturbing. ""We've talked about the fact that this virus can live outside the body, can live on surfaces. It's unlikely for it to be transmitted to someone else that way,"" Gupta said. ""But why take a chance?"" Gupta said that ""it is hard to believe (the oversight) and there aren't good explanations here."" One Ebola expert, Dr. Alexander van Tulleken, also said the federal response to the first Ebola case on U.S. soil seemed troubling. ""So far, we don't seem to reacting as well as we could,"" he said.

"Greeted by throngs of Catholic worshipers from across the region, Pope Benedict XVI ended his two-country tour in Havana's Revolution Plaza with a reference to what he described as a need for ""authentic freedom."" Changes between Cuba and the world can come only if ""each one is prepared to ask for the truth and if they decide to take the path of love, sowing reconciliation and brotherhood,"" the pope said Wednesday. He also met with the Communist country's former leader, Fidel Castro, before heading to the airport for a Rome-bound flight Wednesday evening. Conflicting reports emerged Wednesday over whether the pope had met with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Two Cuban sources told CNN the pontiff met Tuesday with Chavez, who is in Cuba for cancer treatment. But Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said reports of the meeting were false. In a farewell speech just before boarding the plane, he criticized the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, saying ""restrictive economic measures, imposed from outside the country, unfairly burden its people."" Benedict, whose office has routinely cast the trip in the context of a spiritual pilgrimage, at times addressed political issues -- often subtly, and on occasion more overtly. At the start of his visit, aboard a flight from Rome, he denounced violence caused by the drug war in Mexico and blasted Cuba's Marxist political system by saying it ""no longer corresponds to reality."" Later, he prayed for ""those deprived of freedom"" while in Cuba's southeastern city of Santiago de Cuba. And he made several references to freedom in his final sermon in Havana, addressing a nation that human rights groups have routinely denounced for its abuses. Many in Cuba and around the world listened closely to the pope's homily at the enormous open-air Mass Wednesday to see whether he would expand on -- or be more forceful in -- his apparent criticisms. But his comments often seemed couched in a broader discussion of religious openness. ""It is with joy that in Cuba there have been steps so that the church can carry out its mission,"" but the country must continue to strengthen this path, he said. Tens of thousands of faithful packed Revolution Plaza to hear Wednesday's Mass. The pope arrived in the so-called popemobile, his bulletproof vehicle, which slowly made its way to the altar. At some points, he appeared just a few feet from the crowd, which shifted as onlookers tried to get a closer look. Rescue workers carried away at least three people who fainted in what was a comparably mild Caribbean heat, after waiting for hours for the pope to arrive. ""Every time the pontiff comes comes here, there's always some sort of transformative period for us afterward,"" said Jorge Luis Rodriguez, a Havana resident who joined the thousands that filled the square on Wednesday. But Cuban dissidents complained that police prohibited some activists from leaving their homes to attend the Mass and that others were detained. Amnesty International said in a statement that activists were ""facing a surge in harassment in a bid to silence them during the pope's visit."" Government opponents were detained, threatened or stopped from traveling freely leading up to pontiff's arrival, according to the human rights group. ""The clampdown has seen an increase in arrests, activists' phones have been disconnected, and some have had their houses surrounded to prevent them (from) denouncing abuses during Pope Benedict's tour,"" the group said. CNN could not independently confirm those reports. The pope's visit comes 14 years after Pope John Paul II addressed massive crowds near the towering sculpture of Che Guevara in the historic first papal visit to the island nation. Elsida Martinez, a Havana resident who said she watched from the square when John Paul spoke in 1998, said there was a noticeable difference between the two pontiffs. Cuba itself was also different, she said. ""When we saw John Paul, Cubans didn't really know anything about religion,"" Martinez said. ""Now we're open more. We practice (religion) more. We believe more."" When John Paul came ""it was a different period in our history,"" said Camilo Ortiz, a 50-year-old Havana resident, but the former pontiff's visit still ""had more power"" than Benedict's. ""During that time, there were many difficulties here,"" Ortiz added. ""Now, there are some changes, and things are a little better."" After the island's so-called ""special period,"" which began in the early 1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Cuba -- which had long enjoyed Soviet subsidies -- was confronted with a prolonged period of economic hardship. When John Paul visited years later, the country was still reeling from its effects. Cuba is Benedict's second stop on a tour that has also taken him to Mexico, where he denounced the violence-plagued drug war before traveling to the island nation. ""In Cuba, there will not be political reform,"" said Marino Murillo, vice president of the island's council of ministers, responding to the pope's remarks about its Marxist political system. But some Havana residents at Wednesday's Mass said they were optimistic. ""For me, there's a hope"" that comes with Benedict's visit, Ortiz said. ""There's a hope that something's going to change.""","Pope Benedict XVI meets with former Cuban leader Fidel Castro .

"(CNN) -- Team Sky are considering taking legal action following the accident which saw their rider Juan Antonio Flecha hit by a car during Sunday's ninth stage of the Tour de France. Spaniard Flecha was part of a five-man breakaway group when he was struck by a French TV vehicle overtaking them. Flecha fell to the road while fellow-escapee Johnny Hoogerland of Vacansoleil was catapulted into a barbed wire fence on the side of the road.

Despite blood seeping through various cuts and abrasions both riders eventually got back on their bikes to finish the stage some way adrift of the leaders -- with Hoogerland in some distress as went onto the podium to collect the climber's polka-dot jersey. Tour organizers immediatly excluded the vehicle for the remainder of the race and have opened an investigation, while police are also making enquiries and gathering statements. Speaking to reporters on Monday's rest day, Team Sky chief Dave Brailsford said: ""It was plain for everyone to see -- that crash shouldn't have happened. ""Everybody saw it, everyone saw the severity of it so I don't think we need to fan the flames of that anymore. ""Once you've got the facts then you can decide and evaluate whether there's an opportunity for the police to do something. There are different options available."" Asked specifically about the possibility of legal proceedings, Brailsford added: ""All the options includes anything you can think of."" Despite fears he had fractured an elbow, scans have revealed no break, and Flecha told reporters he expects to start Tuesday's 158km 10th stage from Aurillac to Carmaux. ""Tomorrow I'll be able to ride, how well I don't know but I really don't care, said Flecha. ""At first I want to see how everything goes. I'm thinking more long term.

The 30-year-old Katusha rider, who was lying in 69th place in the overall standings, tested positive for hydrochlorothiazide on July 6. Hydrochlorothiazide is listed as a banned substance as it can also be used to mask other drugs.

"Vice President Joe Biden delivered a wonky, populist speech on Monday in Davenport where he endorsed Bruce Braley for Senate and lambasted Republicans for forgetting about the middle class. Biden, who is known for being folksy and prides himself on relating to working class voters, attacked Republicans for what he called attempts to roll back Medicaid, privatize social security and stop any raise of the minimum wage. ""What are these guys,"" Biden questioned at one point during the speech. ""This is a different breed,"" the vice president said of Republicans. ""They aren't bad or good, they are just different. They are just really, really different."" Biden endorsed Braley as the right choice for Iowa voters and, at times, attacked Republican Joni Ernst, Braley's opponent. Biden, however, didn't refer to her by name, instead calling her ""Bruce's opponent."" The vice president also nationalized the race, saying that, ""This election in Iowa is more important than Iowa."" ""This election in Iowa is about sending a message to the entire country and to our Republican colleagues who know better,"" Biden said. ""If Bruce wins and I believe he will... it is going to break the back of the hard right."" Biden has been a strong supporter for Braley, both in this senate race and his previous races for Congress. The senate hopeful said the vice president -- who is considering a run at president in 2016 -- has been in Iowa so much that ""He doesn't need a GPS"" in the state, ""he just needs to know where he is going."" The Braley-Ernst race has remained close throughout and looks like it will come down to the last eight days of campaigning. Polls have each campaign within striking distance of one another, a fact that -- coupled with Iowa being the crucial first-in-the-nation caucus state for the presidency -- has drawn out a number of big name Democrats and Republicans. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio will be in Scott County on Tuesday, while Hillary Clinton, who's polling ahead of any other Democrat considering a 2016 presidential bid, will visit Davenport on Wednesday. Speaker of the House John Boehner will also visit Davenport on Monday night, a fact that was not lost on the vice president. ""My friend, John Boehner, and he is my friend,"" will be here later, Biden said. ""I hope he talks about what the Republicans are for."" Then Biden turned to one camera on the riser next to him and acted like he was talking directly to Boehner: ""Talk about what the Republicans are for John, it is your buddy Joe."" After the speech, which included Rep. David Loebsack, Biden and Braley shook hands with supporters as Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off"" played in the background. At one point, a women presented Biden with her baby. The vice president showed surprise and chatted with the mother. When someone asked them to pose for a photo, the vice president obliged. After the photo, instead of kissing the baby -- which is an old political cliche -- Biden turned to his right and laid a kiss on the woman's temple.","Vice President Joe Biden was in Davenport stumping for Bruce Braley .

"For the first time since facing an onslaught of criticism this year over his foreign policy views, Sen. Rand Paul spelled out his national security principles Thursday in a comprehensive speech. The Kentucky Republican, who's aggressively laying groundwork for a potential presidential campaign, sought to paint himself as a champion of ""conservative realism,"" a doctrine that skates between the hawkish and dovish ends of the foreign policy spectrum. ""Yes, we need a hammer ready, but not every civil war is a nail,"" he said in New York at the Center for the National Interest, a think-tank founded by former President Richard Nixon. ""We need a foreign policy that recognized our limits, preserves our might and a common sense conservative realism of strength and action,"" he added. Rand Paul: Washington's 'barnacled enablers' push for constant war . Paul attempted to address critics that characterize his views as isolationist and was aiming to approach his speech Thursday from the perspective of a major, would-be U.S. leader, rather than a lawmaker, a spokesman told CNN before the speech. He sketched out how and when he would advocate for the use of force, saying he would only do so if he felt the United States or its interests were threatened. He said he supported the response to al Qaeda after 9/11, for example, but disagrees with the continued U.S. presence in Afghanistan. Rand Paul takes veiled swipe at Ted Cruz . ""It's hard to understand our current objective. Stalemate and perpetual policing seems to be our mission now in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria,"" he said. "" A precondition for the use of force must be a clear end and a goal."" He went on to underscore his widely known position that a president should seek authorization from Congress before taking military action. Paul recycled his own criticism that President Barack Obama, ""urged on by (former Secretary of State) Hillary Clinton,"" took action in Libya without approval, yet now the country is a ""sanctuary for terror groups across North Africa."" ""America shouldn't fight wars where the best outcome is stalemate. America shouldn't fight wars when there is no plan for victory. America shouldn't fight wars that aren't authorized by the American people,"" he said. Rand Paul responds to GOP criticism . ""America should and will fight wars when the consequences -- intended and unintended -- are worth the sacrifice,"" he continued. ""The war on terror is not over, and America cannot disengage from the world."" He also talked at length about maintaining diplomatic relationships abroad and expressed support for using sanctions to underwrite diplomacy against countries such as Russia and Iran. And he reiterated a stance he has consistently taken: that the country's debt is one of its biggest national security threats. Dick Cheney: Rand Paul is 'not familiar with the facts' His speech comes as he attempts to further distance himself from the more libertarian views trumpeted by his father, three-time presidential candidate and former congressman Ron Paul. With an eye on the presidency, Rand Paul has sought to broaden his appeal to establishment Republicans and even Democrats. The attention has attracted close scrutiny of his views and past statements on foreign policy, as Paul has been known to frequently break with his own party and lean toward staying out of foreign entanglements. (Last month he slammed hawkish lawmakers for being ""barnacled enablers"" that have ""never met a war they didn't like."") Rand Paul: Aid to Israel OK -- for now . He was widely panned this year when he evolved in his opinion about the crisis in Ukraine, as well as the threat of ISIS in the Middle East, as both situations continued to worsen. On ISIS, for example, he penned an opinion piece earlier this summer openly questioning the value of launching airstrikes against militants in Iraq. But not long after the beheading of American James Foley, Paul became supportive of a U.S.-led air campaign against the terrorist organization -- a change that critics made sure to highlight as a massive flip-flop but what Paul reluctantly admitted as a change in views based on the situation at hand, the ""realist"" side of his worldview. Thursday night, he stressed his support for airstrikes as a way to ""rebalance"" the region but reiterated his opposition to another key part of Obama's strategy: arming Syrian rebels to fight ISIS militants. He expressed doubt that ISIS will be dismantled in the future, saying in the end it will be up to the countries in the region to take care of the situation. Michael Czin, press secretary for the Democratic National Committee, argued that Paul won't be able to overcome confusion about Paul's foreign policy with just one speech. ""For months, Rand Paul has been twisting in the wind, trying to explain his foreign policy vision,"" he said. ""The fact is, a speech defending the indefensible won't make Paul's worldview any more palatable to the American people.""","Rand Paul hits back at critics with a big foreign policy speech.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- A leading critic of Kremlin-backed leaders in the Russian republic of Ingushetia was fatally shot Sunday while being taken to a police precinct by officers, Reporters without Borders said. Yevloyev was a critic of regional President Murat Zyazikov (left), seen here with Vladimir Putin. The authorities in the volatile province in southern Russia said Magomed Yevloyev was shot in the head accidentally while resisting arrest, the Paris-based non-governmental organization reported. Officials have launched a probe, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. Yevloyev was the owner of Ingushetiya.ru, a Web site that frequently took to task local leaders in Ingushetia, a small Russian republic bordering Chechnya in the North Caucasus, just north of Georgia. According to The Associated Press, the site's deputy editor Ruslan Khautiyev said that Yevloyev arrived in Ingushetia from Moscow on Sunday on the same plane as regional President Murat Zyazikov. He said the police blocked the jet on the runway after it landed in Ingushetia's provincial capital, Magas, boarded the plane and took Yevloyev off. Yevloyev was then whisked away in a car and later dumped at the side of a road with a gunshot wound to the head, he said. An impoverished province with a largely Muslim population, Ingushetiya has suffered for almost a decade from unrest spilling over from neighboring Chechnya. President Zyazikov's administration is battling a low-level Islamist insurgency, who launch frequent attacks on Russian servicemen and law enforcement officials. In response, Russia has launched a counterinsurgency campaign that has been criticized by human rights group for abuses such as arbitrary detentions and extra-judicial executions. Over the years, Yevloyev had fiercely criticized Zyazikov. Last year, he accused Zyazikov on his Web site of hiring hit-men to kill him, Reporters Without Borders said. -- CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","Magomed Yevloyev arrested shortly after arriving in Ingushetia .

"It was a journey that those who lost their lives in Flanders Fields would never make. Seventy bags of soil, one from each of the Commonwealth War Grave cemeteries and battlefields in Flanders, Belgium, have arrived in London on a Belgian Navy frigate, where they will form part of a memorial garden to remember those who died in the bloodshed of World War I. As part of a somber ceremony attended by British and Belgian dignitaries alike, the bags of soil were moved Friday onto a decomissioned British warship, HMS Belfast. On Saturday they were being taken to Wellington Barracks near Buckingham Palace. There they will complete the symbolic memorial garden forming a circular soil bed that references the opening in the roof of the Menin Gate in Ypres, from which poppies rain down each year on November 11, and bears the words of John McCrae's famous poem, ""In Flanders' Fields."" But the public will have to wait a while before they can visit the garden, which opens on 9 November 2014 immediately after the Cenotaph ceremony to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I. For Andrew Wallis, curator of the Guards Museum and brainchild of the project, the garden is about emphasizing the importance of remembrance to younger generations. ""The fact that you and I can stand here today as free people, to have free thoughts and to do free actions: somebody actually fought and died for that freedom that we enjoy today,"" he told CNN. ""There was a generation of people who marched away from Wellington Barracks and never came home. ""If we are to get the generation of tomorrow to understand what this is about, for us to pass the torch of remembrance to them, we have to help them understand the significance of this sacrifice."" The memorial garden is just one manifestation of a bond between the UK and Belgium that predates the battles of World War I. The Grenadier Guards, an infantry regiment of the British Army, can be traced back to 1656 when it formed in Bruges to protect the exiled Charles II, and it was the Welsh Guards that liberated Belgium at the end of World War II. The initial idea was hatched five and a half years ago after Queen Elizabeth II's Birthday Parade, but Wallis admits pulling off the project has been a challenge. ""It takes a very long time to get planning permission for something like this right in the heart of royal London, and to get all the various agencies involved to give their agreement. ""It's been an uphill struggle, but we're there now and we're very grateful for everyone for their support."" However, the project is only just over halfway towards reaching its funding goal of £700,000 ($1,150,000) and for the rest Wallis is looking closer to home than Flanders. ""The Belgian people have already produced £420,000,"" he said. ""So it's time for the Brits to step up and help us complete this unique memorial to the fallen.""","70 bags of soil from WW1 cemeteries, battlefields in Belgium taken to London .

"(CNN)Vice President Joe Biden opened the door Wednesday to a potential presidential primary challenge to former secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. ""Yes, there is a chance"" he would challenge Clinton for the Democratic nomination in 2016, he said on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""But I haven't made my mind up about that. We've got a lot of work to do between now and then. There's plenty of time."" Both Clinton and Biden have made no secret of their interest in running in 2016, but Clinton allies have been building an organization that encompasses many of the key strategists and operatives in the Democratic field, and she holds a significant double-digit lead in every poll of the potential field. Biden doesn't always come in second — that position in Democrats' hearts is often held by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a liberal icon whom many progressives see as their only alternative to Clinton. But Biden said he feels there's a chance for any candidate to break ahead. ""I think this is wide open on both sides,"" he said of the presidential primaries. ""Right now my focus is getting implemented what the president talked about last night: to nail down this recovery and get the middle class back in the game. During a round of interviews following Tuesday night's State of the Union, Biden continued to talk up his chances, saying on NBC's ""Today"" he feels he'd ""do a good job"" as president.

"When the discussion turns to the U.S.-Mexico border, living less than an hour away has its privileges. I've covered the international boundary from three states (California, Arizona and Texas) and from every conceivable angle -- including from the air. I once went up in a Border Patrol helicopter that started at the Pacific Ocean and flew east over the fence line. On the Mexican side, homeowners in Tijuana were using the scrap metal wall put up by U.S. taxpayers as their backyard fence. Down the road, groups of young men waited patiently for their chance to cross. What Americans consider an impenetrable barrier, the desperate and determined see as a speed bump on the road to a better life. I've learned over a quarter-century of writing about immigration from the Southwest to be skeptical about claims that the federal government can fully secure the 1,969-mile U.S.-Mexico border. Don't tell that to Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of  North Dakota. The Republican senators have proposed an amendment to the Senate's ""Gang of Eight"" immigration bill. It would increase the size of the Border Patrol by 20,000 agents, and complete 700  miles of border fencing. The amendment might get the bill some Republican votes. But it probably won't do much to secure the border. The property line between the two countries goes through everything from deserts to mountains to private ranch land to a university to the Rio Grande. Ever try to build a fence on a river? It's not easy. Americans can build walls and fences, triple the number of Border Patrol agents, and deploy SEAL Team 6 if they like. Yet, it won't make much difference. Talk to the experts -- the Border Patrol agents -- and they'll tell you: There is no impediment that a person won't go around, over or under if it means being able to feed his family. Speaking of ""under,"" law enforcement officials say there are likely hundreds of sophisticated drug tunnels all along the U.S.-Mexico border built by drug cartels. The smugglers who used to move illegal drugs have now branched out and smuggle illegal immigrants. There is evidence that they're moving their human cargo through the tunnels -- underneath all the nifty and expensive enforcement tools deployed on the surface. Advocates of border security disagree that the crackdown isn't working. They insist that the fact that the flow of Mexican immigrants into the United States is at a historic low is attributable to the billions of dollars we've spent on everything from border fencing and additional Border Patrol agents to high-tech surveillance equipment. That shows how little they know. There are two major reasons that fewer people are coming, and neither of them originated on the U.S. side of the border.  First, there are more opportunities than there have been in recent years to make a decent living in Mexico. And there is a sluggish economy in the United States. So all things being equal, more Mexicans are deciding that migrating to ""el norte"" isn't worth the hassle. Second, our border crackdowns have been very beneficial to at least one group -- coyote smugglers. Every time we build a mile of fencing or deploy more agents, we make it harder for them to do business, so they raise their prices. A trip across the border that, 10 years ago, cost about $500 now runs as much as $4,000 -- more if you absolutely, positively have to be there overnight. Many Mexicans have sticker shock. Honestly, it makes you wonder if Republicans in Congress are in cahoots with the immigrant smugglers. One is putting money into the pocket of the other. If you want to know why the United States has had such a tough time controlling illegal immigration over the years, there's one reason. What other law enforcement operation can you think of where the harder you crack down, the wealthier and more powerful the bad guys get so they can come back and fight you even harder the next time? Here's the elephant in the Congressional caucus room: Americans will never control illegal immigrants until lawmakers  -- in both parties -- ""man up"" and risk angering the businesses that contribute to political campaigns by fining and locking up U.S. employers who hire illegal immigrants. And let's not forget one of the biggest offenders, who is somehow never mentioned by the media -- the American household, with its growing dependence on nannies, housekeepers, gardeners, senior care givers and other helpers. Adding to the problem, pro-border security conservatives confuse ""securing"" the border with ""sealing"" the border. They say they want to secure the border. But when you hear the details -- i.e., the ""100% awareness"" rate and ""90% apprehension"" rate called for by an amendment from Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who is almost certainly going to vote against the Senate bill anyway -- it's clear that what these folks really want is to seal the border. There is a big difference between securing and sealing. The former is feasible; the second is a fantasy. Anyway, I suspect that a lot of this is smoke and mirrors and that the Republican senators who want to block immigration reform are merely seizing on border security as an excuse. Conservatives saying that we can't have immigration reform before we secure the U.S.-Mexico border is like liberals saying we can't have more welfare reform until we end poverty. That's never going to happen, and they know it. So we're just playing games. In the meantime, millions of people are stuck in the legal equivalent of suspended animation, and a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix a broken system is being wasted.","Ruben Navarrette: Tightened border security won't prevent immigration .

"The Republic of Congo's main north-south road runs right on the edge of Odzala-Kokoua National Park. For now, it remains nothing more than a narrow dirt track and Odzala, the country's largest park, very much remains one of the world's last isolated natural Edens. But Mathieu Eckel, head of the park's anti-poaching unit, knows that is quickly changing. For the past year, Eckel has been gathering evidence of Chinese involvement in ivory poaching, carving and trafficking right along the very same road. He now suspects that the global trade that ends in the markets of Asia is more entrenched in this remote corner of Central Africa than many could have ever imagined. ""We've had many stories that involve local poachers and Chinese, but to get the Chinese you have to find them with the ivory,"" he said. Eckel's focus has been the dozen or so Chinese construction camps that dot the road. For the last five years, the Chinese state-owned China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) has been under contract to turn the road into a paved highway. But without actually finding the ivory in the hands of Chinese nationals, Eckel has largely been unable to make any arrests and unable to convince authorities to follow any of his leads. The Yengo checkpoint, manned by Eckel's eco-guards, remains the park's link to the outside world, making it a crucial location to African Parks' anti-poaching efforts.  African Parks, a non-profit group, runs Odzala. On a morning in which the unit had already tracked down and arrested two suspected poachers, one of the guards entered the gatehouse with even bigger news. ""We got ivory, with the Chinese!"" he shouted to Eckel. Eckel bolted outside to the vehicle just as the Congolese driver lunged for the guard holding the ivory. ""Don't move, don't move!"" Eckel shouted, shoving the driver up against the car. Grabbing the carved ivory ring, he questioned the passengers -- two Chinese nationals. A brief interrogation confirmed what Eckel had already suspected. The car was coming from one of the Chinese construction camps, Moyoy. A month ago, the African Parks eco-guards had one of their biggest busts to date, detaining two Chinese nationals with two ivory tusks in their possession.  They were based at the same camp, Moyoy. At the time, it was enough for Eckel to get the local prosecutor to go to the camp with him.  They found small pieces of ivory scattered on the ground among the pebbles just outside one of the buildings. But rather than being allowed to search the premises, the prosecutor ordered the unit to leave. When asked about the incident, the prosecutor told CNN the search was halted because the translator for the Chinese was away and they couldn't conduct a search without explaining to the Chinese why it was happening. Eckel is convinced the camp runs an underground ivory carving workshop and that generally speaking, the Chinese workers in the country are funding and fueling the ivory trade. The Chinese camps that lie along the highway are also located right next to small villages that have always had a history of poaching.  Now, Eckel suspects it's getting worse. ""They ask everybody to get them ivory.  So you can imagine a villager and once a day a Chinese asks him -- do you have ivory?  What will he do, this man?  Of course he will become a poacher."" Last year, his unit busted a poacher with three AK-47s who was working on airport construction in the northern city of Ouesso. ""I asked him to call the dealer, and he called him in front of me, and the Chinese man on the phone said that he has a lot of ammunition and a weapon,"" Eckel said.  It was the first time that he had heard of a Chinese national bringing ammunition to a poacher. The minister of forest economy and sustainable development, Henri Djombo, said he had not noticed an increase in poaching activity since the influx of Chinese nationals to the country. But if any are found to be involved in the illegal trade, they will be prosecuted, he said. ""We do not want the Chinese to be a factor in the illegal activities of elephants... but those who stray away, break the law, will be punished."" As for the failure to search the Moyoy camp, he said it must have been a matter of incompetence. Back at the checkpoint, the carved ivory ring was yet another link to the Moyoy camp, one that Eckel was determined to take advantage of. In the bag where the ring was found are a computer and a pack of cigarettes. One of the Chinese, an English-speaking manager, denied it was his, and said he didn't know who owned it. ""Ok, you smoke, your cigarettes are inside this bag and it's not your bag?"" Eckel demanded, calling his guards to handcuff the men. On the drive to jail, the English-speaking boss continued to deny he had any information about the ring or ivory moving through Moyoy camp. When they reached the jail, the Chinese camp manager and others are already waiting.  The English-speaking boss then said it was his employee who was the owner of the illegal ivory.  His worker signed a written confession in French, a language he does not speak. The United Nations says Asia's insatiable demand for ivory has almost wiped out Africa's elephant population.  According to U.N.  data, the illegal ivory trade has tripled since 1998. The Project for the Application of Law for Fauna, PALF, a non-governmental wildlife protection organization, works closely with the government but also puts pressure on it to fight corruption and initiate and follow through with arrests. ""No network can function without corrupt authorities,"" explains Naftali Honig, PALFs Republic of Congo coordinator.  ""From corrupt authorities in the ports where this stuff is being shipped out of all the way to the people facilitating the trade down in the forest, people turning a blind eye, collecting a little bit of a bribe to let a poacher pass with a gun."" Djombo admits, ""there are those who are not working correctly."" The minister said the government has plans to create a joint committee to fight internal corruption. According to the government, there has been an increase in arrests and seizures. ""It's because of the increase in activity,"" the minister said. ""Why? Because of the international bosses, they are using all means to access these resources through our people, our criminals.  Yes, now we need stronger forces, stronger powers to try and stop this phenomena."" In the span of one week in November, PALF teamed with Congolese authorities to carry out four operations in the capital Brazzaville, arresting eight people.  Those included a dealer with sculpted ivory and a Chinese national who was attempting to board a flight with ivory jewelry after bribing his way through. But a 10-hour drive away, in one of the areas from which the ivory could be coming, Eckel still doesn't have enough evidence to make any more arrests.  After their employee signed the confession and was charged with possession of the ivory ring, the Moyoy camp CRBC bosses agreed to allow Eckel's team to search the camp, in an effort to diffuse the growing tensions. But the next morning, Eckel didn't expect to find anything. His informer had told him where the ivory should be located, but there was a disturbing update. ""This informer told me there was a lot of activity at night... maybe they took off all the ivory from the camp this night,"" Eckel said. The Chinese managers were cooperative, allowing Eckel and his team full access.  But they are hardly equipped to search the sprawling facility or the forest around it. ""This white powder, what is it?"" Eckel asked, holding up a tool he found in a back room. It's to carve wood, the managers said. Eckel was hardly convinced.  He's certain that the connection between this remote corner of Africa and the ivory markets of Asia is stronger than ever.","Anti-poaching leader is convinced Chinese construction camps are conduits for the ivory trade .

"Dozens of people have been killed by sectarian clashes in Yemen's northern province of Saada in the past several days, according to local officials. In recent days, violence has escalated between Houthi rebels and Salafi militants  in the city of Dammaj, with hundreds injured as a result. The Houthis are Shiites and the Salafis are Sunni Muslims. Saada government officials and a spokesman for Salafis in Dammaj accuse Houthi rebels of firing mortars and rockets last week at Dammaj's Al-Mazraa mosque -- part of a Salafi religious institute -- in a bid to force Salafis to leave the area. Earlier, the Houthis issued a statement accusing the Salafis of causing this conflict by transporting thousands of foreign Sunni fighters there. The political arm of the Houthi rebel group accused the Salafis of transforming a religious center in Dammaj into a jihadist stronghold. The Houthis said they would not tolerate such a threat so close to their stronghold. According to officials, regional Salafi figureheads have been calling for jihad against the Houthi rebels, which has raised tensions in the past several weeks. Serour al-Wadei, a spokesman for the Salafis in Dammaj, told CNN that most of those killed by Houthis have been civilians. The International Committee of the Red Cross expressed growing concern about the situation. In a statement released Saturday, the ICRC, which has been trying to access the area, said it was prevented again from entering Dammaj. ""There are a large number of wounded civilians in Dammaj, and the risk to them will only grow if the ICRC is denied access,"" the aid agency said. ICRC teams that are about 8 kilometers (5 miles) away have been ready to respond since last week. ""We appeal for a halt to the violence and for immediate and unconditional access so that we can evacuate the wounded and deliver much-needed medical assistance,"" said Cedric Schweizer, head of the ICRC delegation in Sanaa, Yemen's capital. Concerned about the escalation in violence, Yemeni Defense Minister Mohammed Nasser Ahmed ordered the dispatch of troops to Saada, on Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia, to act as peacekeepers and to deter warring factions. But so far, government efforts to end the fighting have not been fruitful. ""The ceasefire did not last, but a presidential delegation is negotiating a long-term peace agreement with both sides,"" a senior Defense Ministry official told CNN. Hasan al-Hamran, a Houthi spokesman, denied the Houthis are fueling the clashes and said the government wasn't doing enough to ensure foreign jihadi fighters didn't enter the region. ""Foreigners are fighting on the side of the Salafi Sunnis in Dammaj and not Yemenis,"" al-Hamran said. ""The government does not have authority over the Salafi religious institute, resulting in many suspected terrorists entering Saada province."" A Yemeni government official told CNN on background that the situation has been brewing for some time. The official said that for decades, Houthi supporters have complained of foreign interference coming from Dammaj, where there is a Salafi Center. ""But shelling them today is nothing more than a sign of hubris and exposes how the political map is evolving,"" the official added. ""The government's response has been slow because it's taking a cautious approach. The army doesn't want to be embroiled in a seventh war with the Houthis."" Insurgent Houthi rebels fought six wars with Yemen's government between 2004 and 2009. The group, which is thought to have thousands of fighters, is anti-United States and anti-Israel, and maintains its actions are taken to protect its community from government discrimination. Yemen is the most impoverished country in the Middle East. It is facing a growing separatist movement in the country's south and is the hub for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which many analysts believe is the most dangerous wing of the terrorist network. Currently, the country is engaged in the National Dialogue Conference, U.N.-backed reconciliation talks aimed at drafting a new constitution and laying the groundwork for elections to be held next year.","Sectarian violence has led to dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries since last week .

"It's an odd experience flying in to Hatay, southern Turkey, on the border with Syria and its nasty and seemingly infinite war these days: there is a truly international flavor to the passenger manifests. As we flew in, there were two men from Mauritania, one with a limp, accompanied by a woman from Tunisia. On another flight which we saw land, two young men with large backpacks, coming from Benghazi. On another, four Libyans, also from Benghazi. Then a young, bearded man with a noticeably thick northern British accent, there to collect a friend from Leicester -- the pair absolutely don't want to talk, especially when I offer them a CNN business card. Then come the Egyptians, and a Gulf Arab -- he sounded Saudi -- who frantically kissed and embraced the bemused driver there to pick him up. All these were men travelling in small groups or alone. Most refused to talk at all about why they were there, although the man from Leicester said he was doing humanitarian work, and the Benghazi pair were open about the fact that they were going to Syria. It's not a crime to travel to southern Turkey, and there are many foreign aid groups here, so surely many people are traveling innocently. But it is extraordinary to watch this volume of international traffic from countries where al Qaeda has a confirmed and consistent presence into a NATO member state. You find yourself asking: why are these men here, and why don't they want to talk about it? One man -- we'll call him Ibrahim -- has a clearer idea why so many foreigners come here: he's a smuggler, working to facilitate recruits joining the Syrian al Qaeda-linked radical group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Read more: Syria meets chemical weapons deadline . Ibrahim collects many jihadis from the airport -- in fact, he left our interview to collect a Saudi man arriving a few hours later. He walks us through some olive groves as he explains how a route that was once little used has now become a busy - if unofficial - border crossing. It leads from the airport to a local safe house and then, at night, to the often porous fence between Syria and Turkey. In the past few months, Ibrahim tells me, he's moved about 400 people across the border, and that the rate of people making the crossing has almost tripled since the chemical attacks on the Damascus suburbs in August.  And that's just him; there are many other smugglers operating in the area. Turkish officials have said they are intensely involved in the fight against terrorism, as Turkey is itself a victim of extremists, one official saying that any smuggling route that exists must be stopped. The international community didn't act, Ibrahim explains, so the global jihadi response has become overwhelming. And for many, the crossing itself is a religious experience. Ibrahim said: ""When they get to the fence, they kneel and cry, they weep, like they've just met something more precious to them than their own family. They believe this land, Syria, is where God's judgment will come to pass."" Read more: Syrian rebels using satire as a weapon . Repeatedly, we heard the claim that this jihad -- the radical Islamists' fight against the Assad regime and, increasingly, in favour of the creation of an Islamic caliphate in Northern Syria, held formerly by chaotic but moderate rebels -- is a final calling. Many of these devout Muslims believe they are joining the final battle prophesied as happening in Syria -- known as al-Sham -- which will herald the end of the world. The recruits are ecstatic; they never thought this final fight would come in their lifetime. One such believer we meet -- we'll call him Hamza -- is visibly shaking with excitement about crossing over into Syria the next morning. Hamza is from the restive Sunni stronghold of Anbar in Iraq, and explains that before the U.S.-led invasion he was not a radical, or even particularly religious; now he epitomizes the hard-core beliefs that are fuelling the Islamist parts of the Syrian rebel movement. Chillingly, he smiles and almost giggles as he talks of how happy he is to be going to Syria, to become a martyr, to die in the jihad. Hamza's presence here is a sign of something that Washington is increasingly aware of: the borderless nature of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. He explains the group's goal to establish a caliphate all the way from Anbar in Iraq, to Idlib, in the northeast of Syria. The result: An Islamic state where hardline Islamist rules are followed, limiting the role of women and imposing often crude Islamist justice on those who violate their codes. Hamza's journey too is remarkably telling. He says he chose to fly into Turkey and come across the border as it was so much simpler than travelling along the hot dusty roads from Anbar, which neighbors Syria, through rebel-held regions. Travelling through Turkey has become so straightforward and comfortable that it is the route of choice for this jihadist. Read more: Syrian snipers 'target pregnant women' ""There are people coming from Holland, Germany, even Peru,"" he said, claiming that the number of European recruits to the jihad is exceeding the Arab complement. The reason for this is clear: anger at the failure by the United States and European nations to take military action against the Assad regime after the August chemical attacks. It's a failure that has, Hamza says, also made those nations the enemy. ""Our fight is with the West now too, as their silence means they are complicit,"" he says, listing the ""international community"" alongside Iran, Russia and the Assad regime as an enemy. And this is where the story of Syria's endless bloodshed gets absurdly confused; the Assad regime has constantly claimed it is fighting terrorism, even when -- a year ago -- it was shelling civilians loyal to the moderate rebels. Slowly, as the outside world [you mean Western nations] failed to come to the rebels' aid, the Islamists gained sway. One key group, Jabhat al-Nusra, was declared a terrorist organization by the U.S. in 2012, and now, as if to validate the Assad regime's earlier fiction, ISIS has become perhaps the pre-eminent group inside northern rebel-held Syria. ISIS is linked to al Qaeda; it seeks an Islamic caliphate, it blames the West for what is happening, and it is sitting on NATO's border. Read more: Syrian war's brutality isn't going away . Turkey already realizes how serious this is. They repeatedly insist they are fighting extremists in the region. Their president, Abdullah Gul, warned this weekend in an interview with the Guardian, that Europe cannot entertain the idea of ""something like Afghanistan on the shores of the Mediterranean."" A Turkish official who did not want to be named discussing a sensitive issue, told CNN that ""as a country that has suffered from terrorism, it is irrational [for anyone] to think that Turkey would support these terrorist groups. If these crossings are happening, then we need to review the entire process... the entire chain of recruitment and travel needs to be addressed."" He added that extremist groups were getting stronger inside Syria because the international community had failed to tackle the Syrian crisis. ""As long as that continues these groups get stronger each month"", he said. But the reality is that it is nearly here already. We stood at the Turkish border and filmed a chilling sight: the flag of ISIS, flying calmly over a minaret a few hundred meters away in the Syrian town of Jarablus - a sign that they control the town. Turkey now has to reconcile the seemingly relaxed traffic of jihadis into their south to travel into Syria -- many of whose aim is to help establish an al Qaeda-friendly caliphate -- with the fact they can now see al Qaeda from their border. It couldn't get any closer. Read more: Syrian rebels embrace Sharia law .","Smugglers are helping would-be jihadis travel across border from southern Turkey to Syria .

"Jimmy Kimmel got us again. Did you see the video of the Russian wolf that was supposed to have been roaming the hallways of the Olympic Village? One word: Fake. Kimmel admitted the prank on his late night TV show, saying his crew filmed the American wolf and got permission from Kate Hansen, a member of the U.S. luge team, to post it on her Twitter and YouTube accounts. ""I'm pretty sure this is a wolf wandering my hall in Sochi,"" her tweet said.  More than 1.7 million people have checked out the video. Both Hansen and the wolf appeared on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" on Thursday night. Hansen said the video created a bit of a stir in the Olympic Village. ""Security started freaking out, because technically it was a breach. You know, athlete safety,"" Hansen told Kimmel via Skype from Sochi.  ""It kind of went a little crazy here."" By the way, the wolf is named Rugby and he's an American timberwolf mix, according to his trainer in Los Angeles.  Folks online were speculating that he was possibly a husky or German Shepherd mix. This isn't the first time Kimmel has pulled the wolf over our eyes. Remember the twerking stunt back in September, right after Miley Cyrus showed us her moves on the VMAs . A woman who was twerking upside down in what appeared to be her living room takes a tumble when surprised by her roommate.  She crashes into a coffee table, knocks over some candles and sets her pants on fire. Yes, Kimmel did that one too.

"A Syrian college student who tried to help another after two bombs exploded at their university experienced an unthinkably gruesome moment. Simon, an Aleppo University dental student, ran to help a young woman he saw walking zombie-like and clearly injured. He shouted to her and reached out. ""I came to hold her hand ... to help her ..."" Simon said. ""It came off of her. I was holding her dismembered hand in mine."" Death came to Aleppo University, a place that has somehow avoided much of the carnage of the Syrian war. A video purportedly showing the blasts was posted on YouTube. At least 87 people were killed and dozens were wounded after twin blasts shook the campus on Tuesday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based group that is speaking for rebels fighting to oust the country's president. The death toll is expected to rise, but the observatory says the majority of the dead are students and civilians who've had to flee their homes because of the war and have been living in the university dorms. ""I was on campus when I heard a plane over head from a distance,"" Simon recalled to CNN. ""Suddenly a loud explosion erupted just 50 meters away at the gates of the College of Architecture,"" he said. ""Since many roads in Aleppo are blocked, this is one of the few roadways that is open for those traveling though Aleppo."" At least 10 cars were blown to nothing, killing the people inside, he said. Minutes later a second blast exploded a few meters away. ""But this time, thank God, it was mainly material damage, not casualties,"" he said. He ran to help the injured and began loading Suzuki trucks with the wounded and the dead. It was chaos. He was following his instincts in that moment. Each vehicle sped off with about 10 bodies. ""I counted,"" he said. ""At least 50 bodies."" When he got to the hospital, he saw an awful scene. The hospital was full of so many who appeared critically wounded. By the time CNN spoke with him, Simon was trying to process what he'd experienced. Students on campus believe the government specifically targeted the school. ""Aleppo University is known as the university of the revolution,"" Simon said. ""We staged a peaceful protest last week, and this is why were targeted. Our pro-government professors would always threaten us and say 'we swear we will shell this university.'"" Simon told CNN that 15 minutes after the explosions, Al Duniya TV, a pro-government station, was on the scene. ""We were wondering how they got there so fast,"" he said. He said that when the bombs went off, the university gates were closed, and campus security would not open them. ""Students were trying to climb the fences to get out, but security pushed them back,"" he said. The students then turned on the Duniya TV crew and began beating them. He said the crew was reporting that there had been a ground explosion, but he and others were sure that it was aerial shelling, suggesting that the government targeted the campus. ""They were lying in front of our eyes!"" Simon said. Then, men known as Shabiha appeared, he said. The Shabiha is a group of typically hulking men who are regarded as the shadowy arm of the government and are infamous for their strong-arm tactics. The men began shouting speeches praising President Bashar al-Assad. ""Just 15 guys chanting for Assad,"" Simon said. While parents were likely learning whether their kids were dead or alive, the international community did what it has done virtually since the outbreak of violence in Syria -- issue condemnations of the bloodshed. ""The United States is appalled by the Syrian regime's deadly attack yesterday near the University of Aleppo, which reportedly killed more than 80 people and injured more than 150 people,"" said U.S. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland in a written statement issued Wednesday. The United States understood through eyewitness accounts that ""regime planes launched aerial strikes in the vicinity of university facilities,"" it continued. ""We condemn any attack on unarmed civilians and continue to emphasize that those responsible for unlawful killings and other violations of international law will be identified and held accountable."" The United Nations posted a response on its website on Wednesday. ""Deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian targets constitutes a war crime. Such heinous attacks are unacceptable and must stop immediately,"" a spokesman for U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon said. More than 60,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Syria, and hundreds of thousands more have been displaced since the uprising against al-Assad began in March 2011, according to the United Nations. On Thursday, at least 123 people across the country died, according to local committees recording such information. Anti-government activist Abu Rami told CNN that 13 families were killed in Homs. The alleged massacre occurred in the farming village of Husweyeh with a population of about 1,500. Rami said the families killed were Sunnis, suggesting that the killers were motivated by sect differences. Sunnis, Christians and Alawites in the village were spared, he said. Rami feels that the lack of military action by the international community has given al-Assad ""the green light...to do whatever to end"" the uprising against him. Thousands of ""Syrian souls"" will pay for that, he said. Back at Aleppo University, Simon tells CNN that the bombings have changed him and other young people who might have demonstrated to bring change. Now, it's different. They have lost so much. So now they are going to fight fearlessly with everything. Classes are out for two days, he said. ""I wish we didn't have to wait two more days,"" he said. ""I want to go back to school now.""","Aleppo University dental student describes horrific day trying to help the injured after blasts .

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney is rumored to be announcing a choice soon for his vice presidential running mate, and conventional thinking suggests his pick is going to be ""safe,"" someone who brings a high measure of conservative street cred, and preferably from a swing state. In other words, the rumor is the guy who has trouble getting people to like him is going to pick someone even more boring than him. It seems he hasn't figured out that as long as Barack Obama is president, his base will be fired up in spite of his dull personality, so what he doesn't need to do is waste this pick on a running mate Republicans will like. What he needs is someone who can attract voters on the fence. A media darling with a successful track record to point to and someone whose social politics won't immediately get them labeled by independents as ""crazy."" Romney risks playing running mate hand too early . Enter Michael Bloomberg: that union-fighting/gay-couple-loving renegade who would make things complicated for Democrats because he's managed to get elected three times in the most diverse region in the country while being a rich, old white guy. Four years ago, Sen. John McCain selected a game changer who turned out to be better in theory than in practice. Like Sarah Palin, Bloomberg would be a curve ball. But while she got people talking, the New York mayor would get people talking and thinking. How? By being something many of the other VP options are not: a real Republican. An old school Republican. Who will run with Romney? Romney could go with the current GOP incarnation of the anti-tax, Bible thumper who would demonize social programs, but most everyone would see that as pandering, not problem solving. Bloomberg is viewed as a compassionate leader with many traditional Republican views who would be focused on reducing deficits by increasing revenue in addition to making tough decisions on spending cuts. You know, like that Ronald Reagan guy the new generation idolizes but is reluctant to emulate. Remember Reagan raised taxes to help dig us out of a hole. And while he doesn't like to talk about it, when Romney was governor, he too raised taxes. As did Bloomberg. And if you comb through this country's history, you will see that raising taxes is not the Democrats' way of exchanging wealth, it's been a reoccurring part of the deficit reduction equation and -- in the mayor's words -- ""Republicans who emphasize economic freedom would have a lot more credibility if they'd stop promising a free lunch."" Bloomberg didn't say that four years ago. He didn't say that last year. He wrote that in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in March. That's the kind of honest assessment voters on the fence are looking for. They're not married to a party. They're not looking for partisan cheerleaders. They already see the writing on the wall. They're just waiting to see which candidate is going to be courageous enough to read it out loud. For his part, Bloomberg has already said he felt Romney would do a better job of running the country than Obama. But the reason why he hasn't endorsed the former Massachusetts governor is because of Romney's social politics, which used to be more in line with Bloomberg's before he started pandering to the religious right. However, after nearly eight years of campaigning for president, the one thing that should be clear to Romney at this point is that the religious right doesn't like him. It's just tolerating him because it dislikes Obama more. And picking a safe, religious conservative running mate is not going to make Romney any more attractive to his reluctant base, and it doesn't matter because these people are already resigned to voting for him. But it does run the risk of alienating independents who are leery of a social policy agenda hijacking the attention that needs to be directed at the economy. In the fall of 2010, Republicans came storming back into power under the guise of creating jobs and fixing the economy. By the spring, we nearly had a government shutdown over the party's obsession with Planned Parenthood during budget talks. The country cannot afford another platform bait-and-switch. So if planting that leak of Condi Rice being on the shortlist of running mates was Team Romney's way of getting the attention off his tax returns and his time at Bain, it was a very good effort. But that distraction is going to be short-lived if he pulls a name such as Tim Pawlenty or Washington insider Rob Portman out of the hat. They may be safe, but safe is not what Romney needs. Safe isn't what the country needs. Safe isn't going to solve our economic problems, and safe is definitely not going to win the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Many expect Mitt Romney to pick a ""safe"" conservative running mate .

"This city's anti-tech backlash took a new turn Sunday when protesters lashed out at Google Ventures partner Kevin Rose, waving banners outside his home while demanding that Google fund ""anti-capitalist"" communities in the Bay Area. Claiming to represent service workers, the protesters handed out fliers in the city's Potrero Hill neighborhood that called Rose a ""parasite"" and blamed him for helping fuel the ""tech startup bubble that is destroying San Francisco."" The episode was the latest in a wave of anti-tech-industry protests that have been picking up steam in this city over the past year. Protesters complain an influx of highly paid tech workers is driving up rents, forcing out longtime residents and robbing the city of its famously eccentric character. Most of the anti-tech fervor has focused on big-name companies such as Google and Twitter and the private bus systems that ferry their employees from the city to various corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. It's rarer for the protests to target specific people, although in January an unidentified group protested at the Berkeley home of a Google engineer best known for helping develop the company's self-driving car. The 37-year-old Rose is probably best known as the co-founder of Digg, the news aggregation site he helped launch in 2004. After Rose's last startup was acquired by Google, he went to work at Google Ventures, where he helps decide which startups the company's venture-capital arm will invest in. The protesters claim such funding encourages too many young, wealthy entrepreneurs to move to the Bay Area. Rose met the protesters head-on by posting an image of their flier to Instagram and Twitter. In a tweet Sunday he noted as ""odd"" their use of Google products, such as Android phones and YouTube, to tape and share videos of the protests. But he also said he agreed with the protesters in part. ""We need to solve rising rents, keep the SF culture, and crack down on landlords booting folks out,"" Rose tweeted. ""SF is such a great place, definitely need to figure out a way to keep the diversity."" A local group called Counterforce appears to have claimed responsibility for the protest, posting a lengthy screed about Rose on a blog, kevinroseisaterribleperson.wordpress.com. The post demands that Google give $3 billion to an anarchist organization so it can ""create autonomous, anti-capitalist, and anti-racist communities throughout the Bay Area and Northern California."" Google has not yet publicly responded to the demand.","Protesters targeted Google Ventures exec Kevin Rose's home Sunday .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Arranging to have pizzas delivered to a stranger's door is a classic prank. On the Web, it's charity. Ashley Qualls found that out recently when she posted an offer on the link-sharing website called Reddit. The Santa Clarita, California, native was feeling especially charitable one day and asked the site's audience of 18.8 million visitors how she could donate to people in need. ""Someone had commented saying, 'Hey, you should take this over to Random Acts of Pizza,' "" Qualls said. Surfing to that section, she found people posting their pleas for free pizza. Members are encouraged to place orders for requests they feel especially moved by. One person said on Thursday that he went out of town and left his wallet at home, and another said he lost his credit card and is sick of eating tortillas. But the true spirit of Random Acts of Pizza, the creators and some members say, involves donating to people who couldn't otherwise feed themselves -- and yet are Web savvy enough to panhandle online. ""It's about helping someone out while they're down at the moment,"" Qualls said. She has sent 10 pizzas so far that were delivered to hungry strangers. Qualls has been active in other charity work, including online-donation programs, but Random Acts of Pizza provides ""instant gratification,"" she said. Pizza recipients generally give thanks and sometimes snap a picture of the empty pizza box after the order is placed, in 30 minutes or less. The section's popularity has tipped. It received 226,000 visitors in a recent week. Other charitable efforts on Reddit have taken off. SnackExchange, Food Pantry and Closet Swap all encourage giving to the poor. Still, the 10-person team that develops Reddit, which itself has grown significantly in the last few months, were surprised to see the program take off. Earlier this month, they pooled their cash and spent $120 on pizzas for the Homeless Youth Alliance in San Francisco. ""We never would have said, 'Oh, Reddit would be a great platform to give pizza to strangers,' "" said Erik Martin, Reddit's new general manager. Donors receive the person's home address through a private message and can quickly place an order using the many websites designed for food delivery. ""A big factor is just how easy it is,"" said Daniel Rogers, a lawyer from Texas who started the section. Rogers, along with John Mitchell, a former computer technician in Idaho, are attempting to get Random Acts of Pizza on the radar of a major national pizza chain. Domino's Pizza and Little Caesars Pizza have expressed vague interest, Mitchell said. Separately, Reddit, which is owned by publisher Conde Nast, has reached out to the big restaurants. ""We've heard of the program, but have had no direct contact with Reddit,"" Domino's spokesman Tim McIntyre wrote in an e-mail. Random Acts of Pizza sent a request to CashStar, which powers the system that many retailers use for ordering gift cards and which many Random Acts of Pizza donors use to gift meals, asking the site to accept credit cards from outside the United States, Mitchell said. But the process is slow-moving. CashStar CEO David Stone said through a spokeswoman that he had never heard of the group. The co-creators of the pizza-giving program have wives and children, and they each lost their jobs during the worst of the economic downturns. Since connecting online (they've never met) and improving their fiscal situations, Rogers and Mitchell decided to organize a charitable group online. But why cheese, sauce and dough? ""It was the one food during that time period (of hardships) that I didn't have a lot of, that I love,"" Rogers said. ""It wasn't just about pizza. It's about just getting that kind of comfort food and that kind of hope.""","A link-sharing website called Reddit is host to several grassroots charity efforts .

"We were like David against Goliath. We fought long and hard, and in the end we prevailed. After 14 long years in the dustbins of Congress, mainly due to strong opposition from the Catholic Church, the Reproductive Health (RH) Bill was approved by both the Senate and the House of Representatives on Monday, 17 December 2012. Indeed, there is no force more powerful than an idea whose time has come. And the time for a Philippine reproductive health law is now. The Philippines remains one of the poorest countries in the world because, among other things, for a long time, it refused to acknowledge what could easily be seen when one glances out the window: the country desperately needs a reproductive health law. Not having a reproductive health law is cruelty to the poor. The poor are miserable because, among other reasons, they have so many children. Providing reproductive knowledge and information through government intervention is the humane thing to do. It can help the poor escape the vicious cycle of poverty by giving them options on how to manage their sexual lives, plan their families and control their procreative activities. The phrase ""reproductive rights"" includes the idea of being able to make reproductive decisions free from discrimination, coercion or violence. Many poor women do not receive information on how to receive reproductive health care.  Our underprivileged women have to accept standards lower than what they need, want, or deserve. According to the Department of Health, the mortality rate for Filipino mothers increased to 221 per 100,000 live births in 2011 from 162 per 100,000 live births in 2009. But not only do the women suffer, the children do, too. The children remain undernourished and undereducated because their parents are ignorant about reproductive health care and choices. In short, the bill merely wants to empower a Filipino woman from the poorest economic class to march to the nearest facility operated by the Department of Health or the local government unit, to demand information on a family planning product or supply of her choice.  The bill, at the simplest level, wants to give an indigent married woman the freedom of informed choice concerning her reproductive rights. If the bill is highly controversial, it is not because it is dangerous to humans or to the planet.  It is not subversive of the political order.  It is not a fascist diktat of a totalitarian power structure.  The reason this bill is emotionally charged is because of the fervent opposition of the Catholic Church in the Philippines and those who wish to be perceived as its champions. Yet the majority of Catholic countries around the world have passed reproductive health laws, even Italy where the Vatican City is located.  Other nations include Spain, Portugal, Paraguay, Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, Colombia and Argentina. Apart from the Catholic Church, all other major religions in the Philippines support the RH Bill. Other major Christian churches have not only officially endorsed the bill but have published learned treatises explaining their position. Support also comes from the Interfaith Partnership for the Promotion of Responsible Parenthood, the National Council of Churches in the Philippines, the Iglesia ni Cristo and the Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches. The position of these Christian bodies is supported by the most authoritative body of Islamic clerics in the Philippines, the Assembly of Darul-Iftah of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. These constitute the top-ranking ulama, deemed to have the authority to issue opinions on matters facing Islam and Muslims. In 2003, they issued a fatwah or religious ruling called ""Call to Greatness."" It gives Muslim couples a free choice on whether to practice family planning. The Filipino people, regardless of religion, are in favor of RH.  In June 2011, the Social Weather Stations, a survey group, reported that 73% of Filipinos want information from the government on all legal methods of family planning, while 82% say family planning method is a personal choice of couples and no one should interfere with it. An October 2012 survey among young people aged 15 to 19 years old in Manila shows that 83% agree that there should be a law in the Philippines on reproductive health and family planning. This is the will of the Filipino people; it is the democratic expression of what the public wants from government.  The anti-RH groups are mute on this ineluctable fact. Reproductive health care is a human right. The people are entitled to demand it from their government and the government is obligated to provide it to its constituents.","Philippines leader signs divisive reproductive health bill .

"Earlier this year, CNN asked a good friend and business associate of Joseph McStay what he thought happened to the California salesman and his family. How did Charles ""Chase"" Merritt think they were killed? ""I have absolutely no clue,"" Merritt told CNN in an exclusive television interview in January. Police believe he does. On Wednesday, they arrested Merritt, 57. He is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of McStay, his wife Summer and their two small boys. The family disappeared from their home in northern San Diego County in February 2010. Their remains were found a year ago, in shallow graves in the Mojave Desert, about 100 miles north of their home. The discovery ended the mystery of what happened to the McStays. But who killed them, and why? 'Cold and callous' murders of McStay family solved, authorities say . ""If I were to guess, like anyone else, I would think it was probably random because I honestly don't believe that family had anything to do with it. I don't think that any of his friends had anything to do with it. Joseph was just too well-liked,"" Merritt told CNN in January. Announcing the arrest Friday, authorities in San Bernardino County said they believe the family died of blunt force trauma inside their home, but they declined to discuss specifics of the deaths or a motive. ""I am definitely the last person he saw,"" Merritt told CNN . In his interview with Kaye, Merritt said he and McStay were business associates who became friends. Merritt made custom indoor waterfalls and McStay would buy them, he said. They had met in 2007 when McStay needed some help with a water feature. They played paintball together. They had dinner at Merritt's place a couple times a week, he said. Merritt helped him move. He'd also spent time with the McStays and gotten to know the family, he said. Merritt and McStay met for a business lunch in Rancho Cucamonga the day the family disappeared. ""I am definitely the last person he saw,"" Merritt said. He told CNN they were also on the phone constantly, perhaps 12 to 13 times that day. There was another call from McStay's phone to Merritt the night of February 4, 2010. It came about 40 minutes after a neighbor's security camera captured the family's Isuzu pulling out of their cul-de-sac. Merritt didn't answer. Merritt told he told CNN's Kaye in January he was watching television with his then-girlfriend and he picked up the phone, looked at it and set it back down. He was tired. He called back the next day, he said. Was that just a regular call from his friend, or could it have been a call for help? ""There are hundreds of scenarios. I have gone over all of them in my head,"" he said. ""Of course I regret not picking up the phone."" The disappearance of the McStays . Merritt was questioned by police after the disappearance. They just asked him the ""standard questions,"" he said. He also claimed to have taken a polygraph test. What did it show? ""I don't know,"" he said. ""Apparently -- I mean I haven't -- after I took the polygraph test, law enforcement has not contacted me at all since. So, I kind of simply assumed: Well, apparently that resolved the issues that they may be looking at with me."" Merritt said he didn't recall the police directly asking him if he killed the McStays. That was because at the time it seemed they were four people who left on their own volition, he said. Lucrative waterfall project lay ahead, Merritt told CNN . Police had never named Merritt as a suspect before Wednesday's arrest. He has served time in prison, according to criminal records from California, but none of the crimes involved violence. According to the Los Angeles Times, Merritt spent most of his life working with his hands. He received a metalworking license in 1982. At their lunch the day of the disappearance, Merritt said, he and McStay talked business -- just business. They were working on a waterfall project for a Saudi couple and Merritt said there needed to be a large check written to a stainless steel company that was doing work for them. McStay seemed happy. On the horizon was another project that would involve 500 waterfalls. Each one would sell for $17,000 or $18,000 -- as much as $9 million total -- but McStay still needed to sign the contract. ""It was pretty much a done deal,"" Merritt said. San Bernardino authorities said Friday that after reviewing 4,500 pages of investigative records, executing 60 search warrants and conducting 200 interviews, they believe Merritt acted alone. He appeared in court on Friday, but his arraignment was postponed until next Wednesday. His lawyer, Robert Ponce, left court without speaking to reporters.","Chase Merritt told CNN in January that he met Joseph McStay in 2007 .

"Last week,  a 22-year-old Dutch journalist was gang-raped in Tahrir Square and had to undergo surgery for severe injuries. The assault reminds us yet again of an often overlooked aspect of the Egyptian revolution. When Egyptians overthrew their dictator in 2011, one of the first celebratory acts in Tahrir Square included the gang beating and sexual assault of American journalist Lara Logan, who, like the Dutch journalist, landed in the hospital. The Logan rape has always been portrayed as another unfortunate byproduct of mob violence. In fact, it was much more than that. It was a warning shot fired by men whose political beliefs are founded on a common pillar: Women must stay out of the public square. One of the hallmarks of revolutionary victory in Tahrir Square has always been rape and sexual harassment. Mobs of men routinely set upon women, isolating, stripping and groping. No one is ever arrested or held accountable, and elected officials shrug their shoulders and blame the victims. Vigilante groups have been organized to track the incidents.  Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment, one of the groups, recorded 46 cases of sexual assaults and harassment against women on Sunday night alone -- and has added 17 more to its list that the group said happened Monday. Egyptian women are the primary victims of sexual violence, and ultimately they are the intended recipients of the message: Stay home, your input in government and politics is not wanted. Opinion: Why Egyptian protestors welcome the support of the army . Raping foreign journalists -- guaranteed to attract global attention --  is merely a more efficient way of getting that message across. When Egyptians overthrew the dictator, the Muslim Brotherhood took advantage of public hatred of the dictator to ally him with Western progressive ideals, including gender equality. Out went the nongovernmental organizations that worked to make divorce easier and inheritance laws fairer. In came the thugs who stripped and beat women in the streets. Granted, some of these crimes against women were committed by the military and the police themselves, as women like Mona Eltahawy (a journalist whose arms were broken by soldiers) and Samira Ibrahim (a young protester who sued the government, accusing an army doctor of submitting her to a forced ""virginity test"") have reported. Dina Zakaria, an Egyptian journalist, reported that the men who raped the Dutch journalist last week called themselves ""revolutionists."" That label should surprise no one. If one fervently believes women should stay inside their homes and out of the business of public life, what better way to accomplish that than rampant sexual harassment and sexual assault in a country in which women's virginity and honor is the sine qua non of female participation in society? Not long ago, Egyptian Salafist preacher Ahmad Mahmoud Abdullah said that women protesting in Tahrir Square ""have no shame and want to be raped."" The public face of the Muslim Brotherhood would never espouse such a statement. But its founding intellectual lights never hid the fact that a pillar of their planned theocracy was keeping women powerless. And their record in office is one of sexist exclusion. Women held only eight seats out of 498 (four of the eight women were from the Brotherhood party) in the disbanded Parliament. Women made up 7% of the constitutional assembly that drafted the Egyptian constitution. No wonder then that the document (approved by referendum in December 2012) refers to women only as sisters and mothers, and only within the framework of family -- not employment or public life, even though a majority of Egyptian women work. Egypt has always been a place where life for women is nasty and brutish, if not short. Last year, a UNICEF survey showed 91% of Egyptian women between the ages of 15-49 said they had to undergo female genital mutilation. The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality in May reported that 99.3% of Egyptian women interviewed said they had been subjected to some form of sexual violence. Rape victims almost never go to the hospital and certainly not the police. There are no medical protocols for rape, and police treat female victims as prostitutes. Whether or not that violence is political is worthy of discussion. I believe it is. At the moment, no one even debates it. It is the elephant in the room. As the Egyptian revolution enters another chapter, and more women get stripped and sexually assaulted in the streets while being systematically excluded from the halls of power in Cairo, it is high time for American progressives and other Arab Spring commentators to stop separating anti-female violence from the politics of the Muslim Brotherhood's revolutionaries. In the broadest sense, the West's response to the treatment of women in post-Arab Spring countries, from Egypt to Syria, says a lot about the status of women here. We might not be able to do anything to stop violent, organized misogyny in far-off lands, but we can certainly stand up for our own principles and call it what it is.","Dutch journalist, 22, was gang-raped in Tahrir Square and hospitalized for surgery .

"The wail of sirens and the firing of tear gas canisters echoed through the streets of the Tunisian capital, Tunis, for a second day Thursday, as the political turmoil triggered by the assassination of an opposition leader continued to spur unrest. Chokri Belaid was shot dead outside his home Wednesday morning, throwing the country into confusion and prompting angry protests. The unrest calmed overnight but broke out anew Thursday, as young protesters threw rocks at security forces on a central Tunis boulevard. Police responded with tear gas, and officers riding double on motorcycles chased demonstrators. Other plainclothes police officers went door to door, looking for people who had been on the streets. As soon as the protestors would head back to the street, they would be met by more tear gas. This cat-and-mouse lasted all day, but the protesters refused to leave. Late Wednesday, Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali, head of the moderate religious party Ennahda, sacked his Cabinet and called for new elections, leaving himself at the head of a caretaker government. However, a top Ennahda party official said Thursday that Jebali's call to dissolve the Cabinet and offer up a new technocratic government is ""not binding."" Tunisia's president: 'The extremists are a minority of a minority' Ennahda executive bureau member Abdel Hamid Jlassi said party officials were meeting to discuss whether to accept the dissolution. Jebali's move came soon after violent clashes broke out in front of the Interior Ministry in Tunis, where police used tear gas to disperse protesters angered by the assassination of Belaid. One police officer died after he tackled looters amid the disturbances Wednesday, Tunisia's state-run news agency TAP quoted an interior ministry official as saying. Protesters also rallied elsewhere Wednesday, including the central town of Sidi Bouzid, the birthplace of the revolution that toppled former President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali two years ago. The French Embassy in Tunisia said all French-run schools in the North African country would be closed on Friday and Saturday. Belaid's family told local media his funeral would be held Friday, according to TAP. Read more: Who will win battle for the new Tunisia? Belaid routinely received death threats for his outspoken criticism of Tunisia's moderate Islamist-led government. He talked about the bullying on his frequent television appearances but said he didn't fear for his life. Belaid had criticized the government, saying it was not doing enough to take on hardline Salafists. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. Some speculate an extremist Salafist group may have been behind it. Support for Belaid went beyond his own party, the secular-leftist Democratic Patriots. He was the voice of a large coalition of secular opposition parties known as the Popular Front and had a reputation for decrying violence. Amna Guellali, of the rights group Human Rights Watch, said the government bears some responsibility for his death because of its ""laxity"" in failing to respond to a climate of rising political violence. ""We warned the government that these incidents of violence should be investigated thoroughly and that people who have perpetrated these acts should be punished ... but we haven't heard anything back,"" she told CNN in Tunis. The climate of intimidation included calls by preachers in some mosques in July for the killing of certain Tunisian political figures and personalities, including Chokri Belaid, she said. ""We didn't see the government reacting to these calls of clear incitement to murder,"" she said. ""A government has to protect its citizens ... especially if there are clear threats against this person."" Jebali, who condemned Belaid's killing, urged the Tunisian people not to rush to conclusions but to await the results of investigations by judicial authorities, TAP reported. Are you there? Send us your photos and videos, but please stay safe. ""Belaid was killed, but the real target behind the assassination is the Tunisian revolution as a whole, ""Jebali said of his political adversary. ""He represented the true values of dialogue, respecting and embracing others in rejecting violence. This is a political assassination."" Belaid's brother, Abdelmajid Belaid, blamed Jebali's party for the killing, and angry protesters stormed Ennahda offices Wednesday. Interior Minister Ali al-Areed, who denied any involvement by his party, vowed to track down the killers and joined the chorus of moral indignation, calling Belaid's assassination ""an attack on all Tunisians."" At the same time, he asked that protests remain peaceful. ""We do not want the country to fall into chaos,"" he said on Tunisian state TV. Lise Storm, a senior lecturer in Middle East Politics at the University of Exeter in England, warned against overplaying the significance of Belaid's death in the long term and said the current protests are in part driven by more general discontent. While Belaid was a well-known figure, his party is small and has no real political platform other than opposition to Ennahda, she said. Although it remains unclear who might have been behind his murder, it is highly unlikely that Ennahda played a role, as some have alleged, she said. The party is moderately Islamist and is made up of seasoned politicians who have waited a long time to be able to govern, she said. Storm suggested that any move to dissolve the current elected government would be counterproductive, since a unity government would find it difficult to reach consensus on reforms. Tunisia has made great progress toward democracy in the past two years, she pointed out, with presidential elections expected after the new constitution is approved, likely later this year. Popular discontent is focused on the issue of jobs and speedier reform of the police and other institutions, particularly in places such as Sidi Bouzid, which were at the center of past political protests, she added. Women's Minister Sihem Badi told CNN that it was important that Tunisians remain united at this difficult time. People are worried that the upheaval may lead to a return to the situation as it was before the Arab Spring revolution, said Badi, a member of the Congress for the Republic party. To prevent that from happening, it is vital that Tunisia remains committed to the process begun two years ago, she said, with the country's political parties, media and civil society coming together to safeguard the freedoms and democratic progress won by the people. Read more: How a fruit seller caused revolution in Tunisia . ""We must protect our revolution,"" she said. ""We need time, we need patience, we need the agreement of many partners -- we can't work alone."" Badi said the violent protests that broke out Wednesday were a natural response to the shocking death of Belaid. But, she said, such clashes are unusual in Tunisia and she does not expect them to continue. ""We have a very difficult period now, but it's important to prepare good conditions for future elections,"" she said, including agreement on a new constitution. Belaid was shot by an unknown gunman as he left his home in a quiet Tunis suburb for work Wednesday morning, according to a witness. The attack was ""a clear message to Tunisians ... shut up, or we kill you,"" Abdelmajid Belaid said. He said his brother had been ""receiving threats of murder for a long time,"" including a text message Tuesday. And Chokri Belaid's widow, Basma, told Tunisian state TV: ""We are damned. The political struggle is damned in Tunisia. Chokri Belaid sacrificed his soul.""","Police fire tear gas as violent protests break out in the capital for a second day .

"(CNN) -- In what the U.S. State Department is calling a ""historic step,"" the U.N. Human Rights Council passed a resolution Friday supporting equal rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. The resolution, introduced by South Africa, is the first-ever U.N. resolution on the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered persons. It passed with 23 votes in favor, 19 opposed and three abstentions amid strong criticism of South Africa by some African nations. Suzanne Nossel, deputy assistant secretary of state for international organizations, told CNN, ""It really is a key part in setting a new norm that gay rights are human rights and that that has to be accepted globally."" ""It talks about the violence and discrimination that people of LGBT persuasion experience around the world,"" she said, ""and that those issues ... need to be taken seriously. It calls for reporting on what's going on, where people are being discriminated against, the violence that is taking place, and it really puts the issue squarely on the U.N.'s agenda going forward."" Divided opinion continues among some countries about whether the time has come to take up gay rights in the U.N. forum, Nossel said, ""so this resolution is really significant as far as gaining widespread support for doing just that."" The State Department lobbied intensively for the resolution, and Nossel said the United States was pleased to see African leadership, from South Africa in particular, as well as strong support from South America, Colombia and Brazil. The resolution also will commission the first-ever U.N. report on the challenges that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people face around the globe. Nossel said the Obama administration hopes it will ""open a broader international discussion on how to best promote and protect the human rights of LGBT persons."" In March the U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a statement, supported by 85 countries, on gay rights called ""Ending Violence Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity."" Friday's vote ""marks a victory for defenders of human rights,"" said Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ""It sends a clear message that abuses based on sexual orientation and gender identity must end."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has made gay rights a key focus of the State Department's human rights agenda, expressing her view that ""gay rights are human rights and human rights are gay rights."" At a gay pride event this month at the State Department, Clinton said, ""Men and women are harassed, beaten, subjected to sexual violence, even killed, because of who they are and whom they love. Some are driven from their homes or countries, and many who become refugees confront new threats in their countries of asylum. In some places, violence against the LGBT community is permitted by law and inflamed by public calls to violence; in others, it persists insidiously behind closed doors."" Nossel told CNN, ""it's not like discrimination or violence are going to end overnight"" because of the U.N. resolution, ""but now ... when there are proposals in parliaments or legislatures around the world to illegalize gay activity or repress people because of their sexual orientation, opponents can point to this and say, 'Hey, the U.N. has spoken out, there is a resolution that rejects this squarely.' ""That is the way these international norms are built,"" she said. ""It's not from scratch. On women's rights, on minority rights, it builds up over time. So this is really a critical beginning of a universal recognition of a new set of rights that forms part of the international system."" .","U.N.

"NAIROBI, Kenya (Reuters) -- Ogaden rebels warned of a looming ""man-made famine"" in Ethiopia's remote area bordering Somalia and called on Monday for a U.N. investigation into accusations the government was blocking food aid to the region. On Sunday, a New York Times report quoted Western diplomats and relief officials as saying Ethiopia's government was blockading emergency food aid and choking off trade to Ogaden. The Ogaden National Liberation Front, which is seeking more autonomy for its homeland but which Addis Ababa says it is a terrorist group bankrolled by Eritrea, called for a U.N. fact-finding mission. ""The ONLF wishes to affirm to the international community that if there is no immediate intervention in the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Ogaden, there will be a man-made famine created by the current regime of Meles Zenawi,"" the ONLF said in a statement. Ethiopian government officials were not immediately available to comment. On Monday, the ONLF said Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's administration was engaged in a systematic and deliberate campaign of violence against its people. ""These war crimes include diverting humanitarian assistance for use by the regime's armed forces ... deliberate burning of villages, arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial killings, torture, a blockade on food aid as well as other commercial goods and other forms of collective punishment,"" the ONLF said in a statement. ""The United Nations bears a particular responsibility to investigate war crimes in Ogaden given recent reports that its humanitarian assistance is deliberately being diverted to armed forces and militias responsible for these war crimes,"" it said. The ONLF itself has been accused of carrying out atrocities, including an April raid on a Chinese-run oil field in which 74 people were killed and seven Chinese workers taken hostage. They were later freed but in the wake of the attack, Meles announced a crackdown on the rebels. It is difficult to get independent information out of the desolate region, which is ethnically Somali.

"(CNN)  -- Serbian tennis has come a long way since some of its top players had to train in empty swimming pools to escape the conflict and bombings on the streets of the country's capital Belgrade. World number three and 2008 Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic, and former female world number ones Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic all grew up at the height of the country's troubles, but their success at the top of the game has firmly put Serbia on the map as a tennis superpower. And now, as Belgrade plays host to the final of the Davis Cup competition, with Serbia facing nine-time champions of the international men's team event, France, the country's transformation from war-torn nation to tennis-playing giant is almost complete. ""We all know that the Davis Cup is a very special competition and playing in the Davis Cup final is the biggest success that my country ever had,"" Serbian world number three Novak Djokovic said at a press conference at the ATP World Tour Finals in London, which CNN attended. Belgrade-born Djokovic, grand slam doubles champion Nenad Zimonjic, 30th-ranked Viktor Troicki and world number 49 Janko Tipsarevic make up the team that will hope to secure sporting success for their country in front of a packed crowd at the city's indoor tennis center. The story of Djokovic and his compatriots has inspired many people in the former Yugoslavian state to take up tennis and the sport is now one of the best-loved in the nation. ""They are massive massive stars in Serbia, they are gods,"" Dejan Calovski from the Serbian section of the BBC World Service told CNN. ""They are viewed as heroes as they are giving the country an identity and something to be proud of. Their stories are quite inspirational and the tennis schools are filled with young girls and boys who want to play like them."" For the men's players reaching the Davis Cup final is seen as culmination of the country's success in the sport and with the added bonus of being able to contest the tie on home-soil, they are much the favorites to become the most recent tennis heroes in their country. ""On paper Serbia is definitely the huge favorite,"" Calovski added. ""They are very much looking forward to playing on their home court and that should not factor any pressure-- it will only be an advantage for them."" The prospect of playing their 16th Davis Cup final against some of the world's top players in front of a partisan Serbian crowd is something that France have acknowledged is a tough task -- but not an impossible one. ""I think that Serbia are the favorites -- they are at home,"" Remi Bourrieres from Tennis Magazine France told CNN. ""They have Novak Djokovic who is unbeatable at home and is playing very well. So they are favorites but only small favorites I think."" With 10 players in the top 100, France captain Guy Forget had plenty of talent to choose from when it came to picking his squad, although the team will be without former Australian Open finalist and world number 13 Jo-Wilfred Tsonga. French number one and world number 12 Gael Monfils will be joined in the team by Michael Llodra, Gilles Simon and doubles specialist Arnaud Clement. France will become the third most successful Davis Cup country of all-time (behind Australia and the U.S.) should the quartet win a tenth title. But unlike Serbia who have a recent major winner in Djokovic, France is without a men's champion since Yannick Noah won at Roland Garros in 1983, and recapturing the the Davis Cup is certainly seen as a way to atone for a lack of success in a sport that remains hugely popular in the country. ""We have a lot of great players in France but have not been able to win a grand slam. We love tennis so we have to hope for victory in the Davis Cup to make up for it,"" Bourrieres added. Whether France can add another title to its collection or Serbia can claim their first remains to be seen. But one thing is certain -- both sets of players will be fighting hard to win the Davis Cup despite having already competed in an 11-month long season. And playing at home, the Serbians will be relishing the tie event more as they look to seal their place in Davis Cup history. ""It is maybe a unique opportunity for all of us,"" Djokovic said. ""So we have to find this little piece of energy that is left and give everything on the court."" ""It is a unique opportunity to have the Davis Cup final played at home -- you will never have this opportunity again. We all are looking forward to that.","The final of the 2010 Davis Cup takes place in Belgrade from 3-5 December .
Serbia and France will meet in the competition for the first time .
France have won the event nine times most recently in 2001 .
Serbia will be playing in the final for the first time but have the advantage of playing on their home court ."
"Maybe it's not surprising that in SeaWorld's hometown of Orlando, an online poll showed overwhelming support for the theme park in light of a recent documentary that has raised questions about its treatment of killer whales. What has turned heads, though, is the fact that more than half of the votes appeared to have come from a computer, or computers, at SeaWorld itself. The CNN documentary ""Blackfish"" traces the controversial history of killer whales in captivity, leading up to the 2010 killing of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by the 12,000-pound orca Tilikum, a whale previously associated with the death of two other people. On December 31, the Orlando Business Journal posted an unscientific poll asking, ""Has CNN's 'Blackfish' documentary changed your perception of SeaWorld?"" By midday Thursday, the paper reported, an overwhelming 99% of respondents said ""no,"" their opinion of the beloved park had not changed. What the Journal discovered upon a closer look, though, was that 54% of those 328 votes had been cast from a single Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is an identifier that can represent either a single computer or a connected network of them. The address in this case? SeaWorld.com. ""Not sure if this will become another belly flop for the theme park giant, but this surely couldn't have been part of its public relations campaign,"" the Journal's Richard Bilbao wrote in a story exposing the vote. The survey results have since swerved the other way. By midday Friday, 70% of the poll's more than 1,700 respondents had said ""yes,"" with only 30% saying no. SeaWorld denies that the flood of ""no"" votes from its computers was a case of digital ballot-box stuffing. ""It's important to note we have more than 6,000 team members in Orlando, between three parks and our company headquarters,"" spokesman Nick Gollattscheck said in an email to CNN. ""I think anyone would expect that an Orlando publication would be read and responded to by some of those team members. ... ""Our team members have strong feelings about their park and company and we encourage them to make their opinions known. If a poll is posted regarding SeaWorld, our team members have as much a right as anyone else to vote and express their opinion. We're unsure why that's being questioned here.""

"Freezing a woman's eggs should no longer be considered ""experimental,"" according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, a move that signals the technique is now standard for infertility treatment. The society reviewed data from four randomized controlled trials and various observational studies that compared fertilization rates, embryo implantation rates and pregnancy rates of fresh eggs versus eggs that were frozen using a method called vitrification. Overall, frozen (or vitrified) eggs had fertilization rates between 71 and 79%, implantation rates between 17 and 41% and clinical pregnancy rates (positive pregnancy tests) between 36 and 61%. The data also showed no increase in birth defects, developmental disorders or chromosomal abnormalities when in vitro fertilization cycles were conducted with frozen eggs, leading the society to declare the technique effective and safe. ""The technology and technique are getting better, and success rates are good,"" said Dr. Samantha Pfeifer, chairwoman of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine's practice committee. ""So with those studies, we felt comfortable saying there is a lot of information on how oocyte cryopreservation is improving."" Freezing your eggs: the costs and other realities . ""Vitrification is basically the solidification of a solution without ice crystallization,"" said Dr. Zsolt Peter Nagy, embryologist and scientific director at Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta. ""And that's very important."" The lack of ice crystallization is key to the health of the egg because, as Nagy explained, ""ice crystallization that happens during slow freezing is the biggest danger for egg ... cryopreservation because ice crystals can damage the cell membranes, and it results in the degeneration of the eggs. ""In vitrification, there is no ice crystallization, so basically, you avoid that problem."" Egg freezing has been marketed as a means for women without fertility issues to preserve their fertility beyond their peak childbearing years. Yet the American Society of Reproductive Medicine says its decision to drop the ""experimental"" label should not be interpreted as an endorsement for women without infertility issues to freeze their eggs for future use. ""We think we should proceed cautiously in using this as an elective technique, especially in older patients,"" said Dr. Eric Widra, chairman of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology practice committee. ""There is an inherent conflict between the desire to freeze eggs and the need to freeze eggs. Freezing eggs for the future sounds like a good insurance policy but may not be an insurance policy that needs to be cashed in."" Could 'personhood' bills outlaw IVF? Widra says that the best way to conceive is still through natural intercourse at an appropriate age and that vitrification should be reserved for women and couples with urgent infertility needs, like patients with medical indications that they will lose their fertility (perhaps a woman with cancer or a specific genetic condition), couples going through IVF who don't have sufficient sperm or couples who are unable or unwilling to freeze embryos. Other fertility specialists disagree, arguing that fertility is different for everyone and that women should consult with their doctors if they decide to put off pregnancy until their mid- to late 30s. ""Women unfortunately are getting married later, having children later, facing more infertility problems,"" explained Nagy. ""Doing fertility preservation by egg cryopreservation is an option for them today. It was not an option in the past, but today it is an option.""","The American Society of Reproductive Medicine lifts ""experimental"" label .

"Despite being an object of culinary fascination around the world, balut -- a popular Filipino food -- is no beauty queen. The 18-day-old fertilized duck egg has revolted even the most daring foodies with its carnal textures, earning it lofty rankings on many a ""most disgusting/strange/terrifying food"" list. While food journalists commonly label balut as the Philippines' ""much loved delicacy,"" in reality Filipinos are decidedly split over their nation's oft-sung snack. The science experiment you eat . Acceptance of balut often depends on exposure at a young age, much like Vegemite in Australia. In an apparent attempt to preserve the delicacy's popularity among the country's rapidly modernizing and discriminating palates, some schools in the Philippines introduce balut to young students during science classes. Students use balut to study the anatomy of birds, then eat the compressed bird beak, veins and developing wings within. ""Our teacher made us eat the egg so it wouldn't go to waste,"" says Manila resident Anna Vecin of her ordeal. ""And if we didn't eat it, we'd get a low score on that day's lesson. Of course, I had no choice but to eat it."" The experience can leave some with a lifelong aversion to the so-called national delicacy. Even balut's tamer cousin, penoy -- an unfertilized duck egg billed as a less carnal option, given that it lacks the semi-developed chick within -- can be hard to stomach. Taste over appearance . For others, balut's combination of savory soup, fresh meaty bird and warm yolk is a revelation. ""My dad had a duck farm once upon a time in Binangonan, Rizal, so at some point growing up, we had a lot of them at home,"" recalls Cheryl Tiu, a Manila-based writer. ""My mom's parents always enjoyed eating it, thus it got passed on to her and her siblings, and then down to us. My favorite part is the soup. And then I dip the yolk in rock salt. ""Today though, I'm not sure if I can eat the whole chick anymore, unlike when I was much younger."" The dish is particularly popular among Filipino families with ethnic Chinese backgrounds. Balut is also widely enjoyed across numerous provinces in China, especially in the south. Like many Chinese dishes, balut comes with a list of putative health benefits. Among these, it's claimed balut can boost male fertility and libido. Balut in New York . Can't make it to Manila? Though balut is hard to find outside the Philippines, New York Filipino restaurant Maharlika offers the delicacy for $5 a pop. The restaurant hosts an annual balut eating contest, held every August. Last year's winner knocked back 27 balut in five minutes. Think you can do better? The gallery above offers a few pointers on how to eat balut.","Balut, an 18-day-old fertilized duck egg, is a popular snack in the Philippines .

"A new CNN poll shows that it's back to a toss-up for the 2014 midterms elections.  A month ago, Democrats were comfortably ahead 50-42%. Now the Republicans are marginally ahead 49-47%: a 10-point swing in public opinion. Of course, the figures don't actually tell us who will win the next round of congressional elections, but they do remind us of a fact that escapes short-termist political punditry: Voters react to events and are liable to change their mind. The rise and rise of President Obama's unbeatable rainbow coalition is not a historical inevitability but the product of temporary trends. To recap, the story a few months ago was that the Republicans had proved themselves incapable of governing wisely and, therefore, of winning elections. By trying to use the shutdown to force a delay in the further implementation of Obamacare, they were accused of putting partisanship before country, of pushing America to the brink of destruction just to humiliate Obama. Their humiliation when the shutdown ended was shown in polling across all demographics. Eight in 10 voters disapproved of the shutdown, including two in three Republicans or independents who lean Republican. But Democratic triumphalism was short-lived. The latest polling showing a turnaround was prefigured by two election results that showed residual conservative strength. In one, Chris Christie won a massive 2-1 victory that saw him make significant inroads into groups thought to be beyond the right's reach: women, Hispanics and African-Americans. In another, an unpopular ultraconservative Republican, Ken Cuccinelli,  lost his gubernatorial race in Virginia but only by a small margin, despite being hugely outspent. Christie's win was probably driven by his personal appeal to voters, but while only 27 percent saw the health law as the top issue, the outcome of the Virginia contest may well have been influenced by public annoyance over the botched rollout of the Obamacare exchanges.  And it would be entirely justified by the trouble with the website and the disappointing discovery that millions could lose their existing coverage in spite of what the President repeatedly -- repeatedly -- told them. In other words, while the public turned against the Republicans over the shutdown, they just as easily - and quickly - turned against the Democrats over health care. Crucially, the health care issue has a more direct impact upon their lives, which means its long-term resonance is likely to be greater. Obama's approval rating is now at its lowest since he took office, which also confirms the scale of the disaffection, and gives hope to the GOP. The conclusion at the National Journal is that, ""Race-by-race polling conducted over the last month has painted a grim picture of the difficult environment Senate Democrats are facing next year."" Of course, this doesn't mean things can't swing back the other way. The key word in all this data seems to be ""volatility."" Voters are fed up with Congress and disappointed in Obama. Who ends up benefiting from the misery will be down to events and good timing. Either way, the idea that Barack Obama established a new New Deal coalition in 2012 that can't be broken by conservative politicians is clearly nonsense.

"(CNN)  -- Viktor Troicki brushed aside Michael Llodra in straight sets in the deciding singles rubber as Serbia won the Davis Cup final for the first time with a 3-2 win over nine-time champions France on Sunday. The 24-year-old was in irresistible form as he won 6-2 6-2 6-3 in just two hours 13 minutes as the hosts claimed the most coveted team award in tennis to spark scenes of wild celebration on and off the court at the Belgrade Arena. Earlier, Novak Djokovic won his sixth singles tie from six matches in the Davis Cup this season as he beat France's Gael Monfils to level the tie at 2-2. Troicki was drafted into the deciding singles in place of Janko Tipsarevic and it proved an inspired choice by Bogan Obradovic. By contrast, French captain Guy Forget saw his gamble of picking Llodra ahead of Gilles Simon backfire as the left-hander could not cope with the aggressive play of Troicki, who hit a stream of winners and broke him eight times. Serbia's incredible journey to the Davis Cup final . The final time came as Llodra served to keep his country in the tie at two sets and 5-3 down. Facing two match points, he saved the first but another passing shot winner gave Troicki his stunning victory. ""This is the most intense pressure ever in my life and to win it in front of my home crowd I think is the best possible way,"" he told Sky Sports. ""I'm lost for words, it's unbelievable."" Forget was angered by some of the antics of the enthusiastic home crowd. ""We heard whistles when the French team was serving and when the ball was in the air. It was only a small minority but it really is intolerable,"" he told AFP. ""When you play against your opponents as well as imbeciles in the stadium, it's very tiring."" The dramatic finale was set up after home hero Djokovic scored a crushing 6-2 6-2 6-4 win over Monfils. Serbia had been up against it after Llodra and Arnaud Clement beat Nemad Zimonjic and Troicki in Saturday's pivotal doubles to go 2-1 up. However, world number three Djokovic stepped up to the plate to sweep aside Monfils, who had been in such good form as he beat Tipsarevic in the opening rubber of the five-match final. ""It's one of the best matches of my career, in the circumstances,"" Djokovic told the official Davis Cup website. ""I have a lot of respect for the French team, especially Gael, who is a good friend."" Djokovic was always in command after breaking Monfils twice in the opening set and he repeated the dose in the second. Monfils had two breaks of his own as he battled in the third set but could not hold his own and slipped to a tame defeat which gave the momentum to Serbia.","Viktor Troicki beats Michael Llodra in straight sets as Serbia win Davis Cup final .

"President Barack Obama on Tuesday eased his rhetoric on the Supreme Court's upcoming ruling on health care reform but repeated his belief that the justices should follow legal precedent and uphold the law's constitutionality. His remarks in response to a question at a media luncheon followed criticism by conservatives that the president had leveled a political salvo at the high court a day earlier when commenting on last week's hearings on the 2010 Affordable Care and Prevention Act. On Monday, Obama said a Supreme Court ruling overturning the law passed by Congress would amount to the kind of ""judicial activism"" that conservative commentators oppose. The comment prompted Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, to complain that Obama had tried to influence the outcome of the case and demonstrated ""a fundamental lack of respect for our system of checks and balances."" On Tuesday, Obama appeared to choose his words more carefully. ""The point I was making is that the Supreme Court is the final say on our Constitution and our laws and all of us have to respect it,"" he said. ""But it's precisely because of that extraordinary power that the court has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly-elected legislature, our Congress."" Asked what would happen if the high court strikes down the health care law's individual mandate, which requires people to have health coverage or pay a fine, Obama said he believed the provision would be upheld. ""I have enormous confidence that in looking at this law, not only is it constitutional, but that the court is going to exercise its jurisprudence carefully because of the profound power that our Supreme Court has,"" Obama said. "" As a consequence, we're not spending a whole bunch of time planning for contingencies."" Sounding a political theme, he said that more important was for ""all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to recognize that in a country like ours -- the wealthiest, most powerful country on Earth -- we shouldn't have a system in which millions of people are at risk of bankruptcy because they get sick or end up waiting until they do get sick and then go to the emergency room which involves all of us paying for it."" The measure is the signature legislation of Obama's first term as he heads into a re-election campaign this year. Polls indicate the nation is divided over the issue on ideological lines, with conservatives opposing the measure as a government overreach and liberals supporting it as a necessary overhaul of the health insurance system. At the joint news conference Monday with visiting leaders from Mexico and Canada, Obama was asked about the three days of high court hearings last week and subsequent speculation that conservative justices would rule against the individual mandate. ""I think it's important and I think the American people understand and I think the justices should understand that in the absence of an individual mandate, you cannot have a mechanism to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions can actually get health care,"" Obama said then. ""So, there's not only an economic element to this and a legal element to this, but there's a human element to this and I hope that's not forgotten in this political debate."" He also took a shot at critics of the health care bill, noting that such opponents now were calling for the kind of ""judicial activism"" they have opposed in the past. ""I just remind conservative commentators that for years, what we've heard is, the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint, that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law,"" the president said. Later Monday, conservative Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, hit back at Obama's comments, saying in a statement that ""it must be nice living in a fantasy world where every law you like is constitutional and every Supreme Court decision you don't is 'activist.' "" ""Judicial activism or restraint is not measured by which side wins but by whether the court correctly applied the law,"" Hatch's statement  said, adding: ""Unfortunately these attacks come as no surprise, since the memo appears to have gone out from the president's campaign that criticizing the Supreme Court is going to help his re-election."" On Tuesday, Obama made no mention of judicial activism, focusing instead on people who have been helped by the law even though it has yet to be fully implemented. ""This is not an abstract exercise,"" Obama said in reference to letters he gets ""every day"" about the law's benefits. The Supreme Court's decision is expected in June in the middle of the campaign for the November presidential election. Obama's likely Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, said Tuesday he was surprised by the president's Monday comments on the Supreme Court case, adding, ""I don't think it will serve him any particular good  function."" ""It is hardly an activist court for applying the Constitution,"" Romney told the Charlie Sykes show on radio station WTMJ in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.","President Obama says the Supreme Court has the ""final say""

"Authorities in the Colorado movie theater massacre found an AR-15 rifle drum magazine Friday capable of carrying 100 rounds, and the police chief said thousands of rounds of ammunition for various weapons had been bought online in the weeks prior to the shooting. Police took suspect James Holmes, 24, into custody Friday after they say he set off two devices and sprayed the theater with bullets from an AR-15, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40-caliber handguns police have recovered. Investigators are confident that Holmes acted alone, police said. Aurora, Colorado, Police Chief Dan Oates said Friday night that Holmes had purchased four guns at ""local metro gun shops,"" and bought over 6,000 rounds of ammunition through online transactions. Assessing what authorities have pieced together about the shooting and the weapons recovered, Oates told reporters, ""As far as we know, it was a pretty rapid pace of fire in that theater."" Life and death decisions within Aurora theater . Chad Weinman, CEO of TacticalGear.com of Chesterfield, Missouri, told CNN earlier that his company had a receipt matching Holmes' name and his Aurora address. The receipt showed that Holmes bought an $106.99 Blackhawk urban assault vest, a $52.99 Blackhawk Omega Elite triple pistol magazine, a $52.99 Blackhawk Omega Elite M16 magazine pouch, and a $77.99 Blackhawk Be-Wharned silver knife. With shipping costs, the total bill came to $306.99, according to a copy of the receipt provided to CNN. The firm sells equipment to military and police personnel -- as well as weekend warriors, Weinman said. The gear that the firm believes it sold to Holmes is manufactured by a company called Blackhawk Company, a ""popular brand in tactical circles,"" Weinman said. ""We were pretty shocked to have discovered it,"" Weinman said. Families of victims receive tragic confirmation . ""Oh, my God, we couldn't believe it"" was how one of the company's owners reacted, Weinman said. Holmes paid for a two-day air delivery when he placed the order on July 2, which would seem to indicate he wanted the materials in a hurry, Weinman said. Purchasing a 100-round magazine for an AR-15 is unusual, weapons experts said. The AR-15 is designed for easy reloading. ""Even without the grand-sized mags, many people who are practiced can reload in 1½ to 2 seconds,"" said Steven Howard, a Michigan attorney and security and firearms expert. Howard said a crowded theater offers an ideal location for a gunman -- particularly one armed with a shotgun -- to target dozens of victims. A large room such as a theater -- where people are seated in rows -- makes moviegoers easy targets, even for an inexperienced shooter, Howard said. Investigators focus on suspect's apartment . Screaming, panicked moviegoers scrambled to escape from the gunman, who wore a gas mask and randomly shot as he walked up the theater's steps, witnesses said. ""The very nature of theaters makes them perfect killing zones,"" said Howard. A shotgun would do more damage among a tightly packed theater audience because its ammunition comes out of the weapon in a reverse funnel shape and would disperse across a wider area, according to Howard. In a theater scenario, he said, ""so many people's heads are lined up next to each other that if you fire down these rows of people ... one blast is going to kill or seriously injure 10 or 15 people, depending on a number of variables."" An AR-15 nonmilitary model, Howard said, shoots one bullet at a time and that bullet ""may go through two people."" Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media . No weapons expertise would be necessary to execute an attack such as the one in Aurora, said Howard, a former U.S. Border Patrol agent. ""Any idiot can do it."" Holmes was apprehended outside his white Hyundai parked in the back of the theater, police said. Three of the weapons were in the car and one was left at the scene inside the theater, said authorities. Howard offered these details about the weapons police say were used in the attack: . -- AR-15 rifle: A rifle that commonly fires bullets .223 inches in diameter. Originally manufactured by Colt before its patent ran out, but now also made by others. Cost: around $900 and up. Its military version is a machine gun, which allows a shooter to fire continuously by holding the trigger down. The nonmilitary AR-15 is a semi-automatic which shoots one bullet at a time, with each squeeze of the trigger. Ammunition magazines for the AR-15 commonly hold five to 15 rounds. Aurora Police Chief Oates said Friday night that investigators had determined the suspect bought more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition for the rifle. As for the 100-round rifle drum and the weapon's firing capability, Oates said he did not know whether the rifle was fully automatic or sem-automatic but ""even if it was semi-automatic, I'm told by experts that with that drum magazine, he could've gotten off 50 to 60 rounds ... within one minute."" -- 870 Remington 12-gauge shotgun: One of the most popular shotguns in history. It can be modified to have a short or long barrel. Oates said the suspect had purchased 300 rounds for the shotgun. -- .40-caliber Glock handgun: Common weapon for police. Similar in size to other popular handguns. Oates said some 3,000 rounds of ammunition for the two Glocks had been bought through online purchases. Opinion: Can we feel safe in a crowd anymore? The attacker also used tear gas in the attack, according to police. Tear gas and smoke bombs would ""add to the panic"" and make victims less likely to be able to defend themselves against an attacker, Howard said. The dozens of wounded victims in the attack could well have been hit by ricocheting bullets. ""Once bullets hit a wall, they tend to ricochet down a wall, but they don't bounce like pool balls like a lot of people think and like the movies show. They follow the last surface they hit,"" Howard said. Carpeted walls, which are common in movie theaters would reduce the risk of ricochets, said ballistics expert Jon Nordsby. Bullets that have first passed through objects such as theater chairs might cause worse wounds. The bullets start tumbling after they first penetrate the object. A tumbling bullet will tear more flesh when it hits, he said. Gun debate renewed after shooting . Crime scene investigators will likely pay close attention to the location of ammunition shell casings and bullets to learn more details about the attack. They also will likely document the locations where victims fell to determine the trajectory of the bullets.

"The Italian Senate passed a series of austerity measures Friday demanded by Europe, as it seeks to ward off fears of a debt-driven crisis. The package was approved by 156 votes in favor to 12 against, with one abstention. It only had to be passed by those of the 320 senators who were present for the vote. The lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, is expected to discuss the measures and vote Saturday. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is expected to step down after the austerity measures are adopted by both houses. Intended to cut spending and boost growth, they include pension reform, with plans to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67, the privatization of state-owned companies and sale of state-owned properties, the liberalization of certain professions and investment in infrastructure. Berlusconi assured European leaders the measures would be implemented in a letter to the European Union late last month amid concerns that the reforms might stall. As the eighth-largest economy in the world and the fourth-largest in Europe, Italy is seen as vulnerable to the debt crisis that has brought down Greece, although economists say Italy remains solvent. Italian President Giorgio Napolitano has said that after the Italian parliament passes the reforms, either an interim government will be formed or elections will be held. Italy gave indications Thursday that there may be growing support for former EU commissioner Mario Monti to take the helm in place of Berlusconi. Monti spent two hours meeting with the president Thursday evening shortly after being made a senator for life, Italy's ANSA news agency reported. The appointment means Monti was able to vote Friday in the Senate. Berlusconi appeared to signal his support Thursday for Monti, who has a reputation as a hard-working, intellectually rigorous technocrat. In a post on Berlusconi's official Facebook page, he wrote that he had sent a telegram to Monti congratulating him on being appointed by the president to be a ""senator for life, reflecting the outstanding achievements"" in certain arenas.  ""I wish him a successful job in the national interest,"" Berlusconi said. Foreign Minister Franco Frattini also said he supports an emergency government of national unity led by Monti. ""He has an international profile that no one can deny,"" Frattini said, according to his press office. Monti was a member of the European Commission for 10 years. For half that time he was the competition commissioner, leading high-profile anti-trust cases involving large companies including Microsoft. Investor confidence plummeted Wednesday when the yield on 10-year Italian government bonds rose above 7%, the level at which other European countries -- including Greece, Portugal and Ireland -- have sought international bailouts. Tensions eased slightly Thursday as Italian 10-year bonds traded lower, following intervention by the European Central Bank. Italy has one of the highest national debts in Europe, about 120% of GDP or about  €1.9 trillion and has seen low growth in recent years.","Italy's Senate approves the economic reforms by 156 votes in favor, 12 against .

"Being a highly productive, contributing member of society demands effort and commitment.  It requires sacrifice and a passion for teamwork. Basically, I'm not interested. On the other hand, I'm wildly enthusiastic about napping.  Which does literally nothing for the betterment of the world, unless you take solace in the fact that at least I'm not walking around touching things. But I really do enjoy my regularly scheduled naps.  So much so, in fact, that my close friends know not to call between 2 and 4 p.m. on the weekends.  The ""baby"" is sleeping. And that's why I was rather excited this week to discover all the social media buzz over the amazing new Ostrich Pillow.  Essentially, it's a soft, padded tube in which you can bury your entire head to take a nap, so long as you don't mind burying your entire head in a soft, padded tube.  Of course, there's really no way you should already know whether this is something you like. ""What?  You haven't tried?"" The creators actually call it a microenvironment, but I think that sounds a little too much like they're describing the inside of my colon.  Which is a little unsettling.  You know, as opposed to a soft ... padded ... tube.  OK, so it's pretty much the same thing. Regardless, I did some serious soul searching -- I pictured myself wearing it in public situations like at an airport or a bris -- and decided that, yes, I'm totally down for living in this tube.  It's so stupendous! Seriously.  It really is.  And as a bonus, in addition to the small face opening for breathing, the hand holes at the top kind of make you look like Admiral Ackbar from ""Star Wars."" ""It's a nap!"" The Ostrich Pillow was conceptualized by the European design duo kawamura-ganjavian, who wanted to find a creative way to provide people with the health and productivity benefits commonly associated with power napping.  Power napping is a lot like normal napping, only when you're done with a power nap, you're expected to actually do stuff. When you wake up from a normal nap, it's completely OK to glance around the room, confirm that John Hodgman riding a unicorn was just an amazing dream, and then roll over to fall back asleep. But the Ostrich Pillow is specifically designed for those shorter periods of rest -- the power naps -- and the creators boast that their invention allows you to sleep anytime, anywhere by creating a ""little private space within a public one, to relax and unwind."" Right now, the product is in the middle of a one-month run on the crowd-funding website Kickstarter, where the creators were hoping to raise $70,000 to get the project off the ground.  The current haul is more than $130,000.  Which according to my calculations is ... more. Perhaps this says a lot about people's attitudes toward napping and the importance of taking a little siesta during the busy workday.  The official sales pitch for the Ostrich Pillow even claims that a 20-minute power nap can increase productivity by 37%. Amazing!  I can only dream of all the things I would get done at the office if I actually worked at 37% productivity.  And to think, all I need is a quick nap as soon as I get to my desk. ""Let's start the morning meeting.  Where's Bellini?"" ""Wearing his tube, mentally preparing to give us slightly less than 50%."" By and large, the Ostrich Pillow seems like a great idea.  It's dark.  It's cozy.  It has a place for your hands.  But the big question is whether people will actually wear it in public.  And we really can't say yes or no based on what I would do, since a better assessment would come from somebody who actually has the ability to feel shame. Nevertheless, I'm still hoping to get my hands on one of these to give it a proper test drive.  But, until then, if you need me, I'll be sleeping under my desk. ""Let's start the morning meeting.

"On a sunny Monday morning, over the open fields of Baylands Park in Sunnyvale, California, an unmanned aerial vehicle was turning heads -- and it came with a cargo of carne asada. World, meet the Burrito Bomber. The Bomber is the beans and rice-filled brainchild of two engineers at popular reviews and recommendations website, Yelp. Their ultimate goal is to send the Burrito Bomber into the wild, blue yonder, wait for a customer to place an order through a mobile app, then have the tortilla-toting plane do a fly-by delivery based on GPS coordinates. ""You have a little parachute that kind of hides up here [under the plane],"" said Yoni De Beule, one of the plane's designers, ""and when the burrito releases, the parachute gets pulled out and allows for the burrito to drop to the ground a little more safely."" The bomber's engineers used a 3-D printer to create their own custom-made parts to allow for burrito storage and deployment, and added a fully remote controlled camera and transmitter to stream live video back down to the ground during flight. ""The plane can totally fly itself,"" says former Yelp engineer John Boiles, ""But these are nice to have as a backup."" That's right. The Burrito Bomber is a drone. Although it currently has to be launched by hand -- and Boiles briefly controls the drone as it ascends -- once the plane hits altitude and a flight plan is in place, the Burrito Bomber operates on its own. Step one for takeoff includes Boiles and De Beule running through a checklist to ensure everything is operating properly.  It's like their version of mission control, just down the road from the Mission District, where Yelp's headquarters are located in San Francisco. Step two is a little less technical. Boiles grabs a few sprigs of grass and flips them into the air to see which way the breeze is blowing, sort of like nearby Stanford University attendee Tiger Woods sizing up his approach to the 18th green. Step three, flight. On the count of three, Boiles fires up the propeller and De Beule tosses the bomber into the air. After a brief wobble, the Burrito Bomber is soaring skyward and preparing to deploy its tasty payload. The idea of airborne munchies isn't entirely new.  The Tacocopter turned out to be a hoax.  And Domino's ""DomiCopter"" is a recent YouTube sensation, showing a high-flying pizza delivery near London. The Burrito Bomber was dreamed up during a Yelp hackathon -- a two-day event held every quarter where engineers tap into their creative side. Yelp provides resources such as 3-D printers, tons of tools and lots of space -- a commodity in dense San Francisco -- to keep their workers inspired. Boiles and De Beule's first hackathon project was a weather balloon they hoped would result in the first ever Yelp ""check-in"" from space.  However, the balloon flew a lot farther than expected and they later recovered it in the Nevada desert.  After a few other high-flying hijinks, the idea for the Burrito Bomber took hold. Along with other projects from fellow engineers, Boiles and De Beule dubbed their creative corner of Yelp headquarters Darwin Aerospace -- named after CEO Jeremy Stoppelman's dog, Darwin, who is frequently found wandering Yelp's offices. Sadly, anyone hoping for an aerial munchies fix will have to keep hoping for a while. The Burrito Bomber is currently just a prototype. Current Federal Aviation Administration regulations prohibit commercial use of unmanned aircraft, but that could change. ""Pending regulations from the FAA in 2015, we'll be able to drop a burrito to a neighborhood near you,"" says Boiles. Until then, parachuting pico de gallo will have to wait.","Engineers from Yelp build the Burrito Bomber .

"(CNN) -- Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, the patriarch of the first family of Democratic politics, died late Tuesday at his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. He was 77. Kennedy, known as the ""Lion of the Senate,"" died after a lengthy battle with brain cancer. ""We've lost the irreplaceable center of our family and joyous light in our lives, but the inspiration of his faith, optimism and perseverance will live on in our hearts forever,"" a family statement said. ""We thank everyone who gave him care and support over this last year, and everyone who stood with him for so many years in his tireless march for progress toward justice."" Timeline: Follow Kennedy's life and career . Kennedy will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery, just a few feet from the graves of his brothers. He is eligible for burial at Arlington due to his congressional service and his tenure in the Army from 1951 to 1953.  Learn more about Kennedy's funeral arrangements » . Kennedy, nicknamed ""Ted,"" was the younger brother of slain President John F. Kennedy and New York Sen. Robert Kennedy, who was gunned down while seeking the White House in 1968. However, his own presidential aspirations were hobbled by the controversy around a 1969 auto accident that left a young woman dead, and a 1980 primary challenge to then-President Jimmy Carter that ended in defeat. View reaction from public figures . But while the White House eluded his grasp, the longtime Massachusetts senator was considered one of the most effective legislators of the past few decades. Kennedy played major roles in passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act and the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act, and was an outspoken liberal standard-bearer during a conservative-dominated era from the 1980s to the early 2000s.  Watch retrospective on Kennedy's storied career » . President Obama will deliver a eulogy at Kennedy's funeral on Saturday. He was ""not only one of the greatest senators of our time, but one of the most accomplished Americans ever to serve our democracy,"" Obama said, speaking to reporters during his vacation in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. ""His extraordinary life on this earth has come to an end. The extraordinary good that he did lives on. For his family, he was a guardian. For America, he was the defender of a dream."" Obama said that Americans knew Kennedy's death was coming for some time, but have been ""awaiting it with no small amount of dread."" Choking back tears, Vice President Joe Biden said his family was ""truly distressed"" by Kennedy's death. ""We lost a truly remarkable man,"" Biden said during an event in Washington. ""He's left a great void in our public life.""  Watch what Kennedy did for Biden » . ""He was probably best known for the ability to work with Republicans,"" said Adam Clymer, Kennedy's biographer. ""The Republican Party raised hundreds of millions of dollars with direct appeal to protect the country from Ted Kennedy, but there was never a piece of legislation that he ever got passed without a major Republican ally."" Kennedy recently urged Massachusetts officials to change a law to allow for an immediate temporary replacement should a vacancy occur for one of his state's two Senate seats.  Watch why Kennedy sought change in state law » . Under a 2004 Massachusetts law, a special election must be held 145 to 160 days after a Senate seat becomes vacant. The winner of the election would serve the remainder of a senator's unexpired term. Kennedy asked Gov. Deval Patrick and state leaders to ""amend the law through the normal legislative process to provide for a temporary gubernatorial appointment until the special election occurs,"" according to the letter, dated July 2. Read Kennedy's letter . Kennedy suffered a seizure in May 2008 at his home on Cape Cod. Shortly after, doctors diagnosed a brain tumor -- a malignant glioma in his left parietal lobe. Surgeons at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, removed as much of the tumor as possible the following month. Doctors considered the procedure a success, and Kennedy underwent follow-up radiation treatments and chemotherapy. A few weeks later, he participated in a key vote in the Senate. He also insisted on making a brief but dramatic appearance at the 2008 Democratic convention, a poignant moment that brought the crowd to its feet and tears to many eyes. Kennedy died one year to the day after that appearance. ""I have come here tonight to stand with you to change America, to restore its future, to rise to our best ideals and to elect Barack Obama president of the United States,"" Kennedy told fellow Democrats in a strong voice. Kennedy's early support for Obama was considered a boon for the candidate, then a first-term senator from Illinois locked in a tough primary battle against former first lady Hillary Clinton. Kennedy predicted Obama's victory and pledged to be in Washington in January when Obama assumed office -- and he was, though he was hospitalized briefly after suffering a seizure during a post-inaugural luncheon. Kennedy was one of only six senators in U.S. history to serve more than 40 years. He was elected to eight full terms to become the second-most senior senator after West Virginia Democrat Robert Byrd. iReport.com: Share tributes to Kennedy . He launched his political career in 1962, when he was elected to finish the unexpired Senate term of his brother, who had become president in 1961. He won his first full term in 1964. He seemed to have a bright political future, and many Democratic eyes turned to him after the killings of his brothers. But a July 18, 1969, car wreck on Chappaquiddick Island virtually ended his ambitions. After a party for women who had worked on his brother Robert's presidential campaign, Kennedy drove his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick, off Cape Cod and across a narrow channel from Martha's Vineyard. While Kennedy managed to escape, his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned. In a coroner's inquest, he denied having been drunk, and said he made ""seven or eight"" attempts to save Kopechne before exhaustion forced him to shore. Although he sought help from friends at the party, Kennedy did not report the accident to police until the following morning. Kennedy eventually pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. In a televised address to residents of his home state, Kennedy called his conduct in the hours following the accident ""inexplicable"" and called his failure to report the wreck immediately ""indefensible."" Despite the dent in his reputation and career, Kennedy remained in American politics and went on to win seven more terms in the Senate. Kennedy championed social causes and was the author of ""In Critical Condition: The Crisis in America's Health Care."" He served as chairman of the Judiciary and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committees and was the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary and Armed Services committees during periods when Republicans controlled the chamber. Obama named Kennedy as one of 16 recipients of the 2009 Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor. A White House statement explained that the 2009 honorees ""were chosen for their work as agents of change."" ""Senator Kennedy has dedicated his career to fighting for equal opportunity, fairness and justice for all Americans. He has worked tirelessly to ensure that every American has access to quality and affordable health care, and has succeeded in doing so for countless children, seniors, and Americans with disabilities. He has called health care reform the ""cause of his life.""  Watch a historian's take on Kennedy's legacy » . Born in Boston on February 22, 1932, Edward Moore Kennedy was the last of nine children of Joseph P. Kennedy, a prominent businessman and Democrat, and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy served as ambassador to Britain before World War II and pushed his sons to strive for the presidency, a burden ""Teddy"" bore for much of his life as the only surviving Kennedy son. His oldest brother, Joe Jr., died in a plane crash during World War II when Kennedy was 12. John was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, in 1963, and Robert was killed the night of the California primary in 1968. Ted Kennedy delivered Robert's eulogy, urging mourners to remember him as ""a good and decent man who saw wrong and tried to right it; who saw suffering and tried to heal it; who saw war and tried to stop it."" The family was plagued with other tragedies as well. One sister, Kathleen, was killed in a plane crash in 1948. Another sister, Rosemary, was born mildly retarded, but was institutionalized after a botched lobotomy in 1941. She died in 2005 after more than 60 years in mental hospitals. Joseph Kennedy was incapacitated by a stroke in 1961 and died in November 1969, leaving the youngest son as head of the family. He was 37. ""I can't let go,"" Kennedy once told an aide. ""If I let go, Ethel [Robert's widow] will let go, and my mother will let go, and all my sisters."" His sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder of the Special Olympics, died August 11. The ailing senator was unable to attend her funeral. His mother, Rose Kennedy, died in Hyannis Port at age 104 in 1995. Kennedy himself survived a 1964 plane crash that killed an aide, suffering a broken back in the accident. But he recovered to lead the seemingly ill-starred clan through a series of other tragedies: Robert Kennedy's son David died of a drug overdose in a Florida hotel in 1984; another of Robert's sons, Michael, was killed in a skiing accident in Colorado in 1997; and John's son John Jr., his wife Carolyn and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette died in a 1999 plane crash off Martha's Vineyard. In addition, his son Edward Jr. lost a leg to cancer in the 1970s, and daughter Kara survived a bout with the disease in the early 2000s. Kennedy was forced to testify about a bar-hopping weekend that led to sexual battery charges against his nephew, William Kennedy Smith. Smith was acquitted in 1991 of charges that he raped a woman he met while at a Florida nightclub with the senator and his son Patrick, now a Rhode Island congressman. Like brothers John and Robert, Edward Kennedy attended Harvard. He studied in the Netherlands before earning a law degree from the University of Virginia Law School, and worked in the district attorney's office in Boston before entering politics. Kennedy is survived by his second wife, Victoria Ann Reggie Kennedy, whom he married in 1992; his first wife, Joan Bennett; and five children -- Patrick, Kara and Edward Jr. from his first marriage, and Curran and Caroline Raclin from his second.","NEW: President Obama will deliver a eulogy at Kennedy's funeral Saturday .

"It's harvest time in Napa Valley, and it appears that the 6.0-magnitude earthquake that struck Northern California did not impact vineyards or the grapes on the vine, a local vintners' association said. The Sunday earthquake that sent more than 100 people to the hospital also sent wine barrels tumbling and wine bottles flying in the early morning hours. Yet a majority of region's vineyards are open for visitors. Some wineries suffered damage to their barrel storage areas, wine inventory and production equipment over the weekend, but ""there were no reports of winery employees being injured by the earthquake,"" according a statement by Napa Valley Vintners, an association of 500 area vintners. Signorello Estate, which took to social media to announce the Napa winery would be closed Sunday, reopened Monday for business, an employee told CNN. Napa's Etude Wines stayed closed another day on Monday to clean up damage from the earthquake, but announced on its website that its tasting room would reopen on Tuesday. ""Weather throughout the growing season has been ideal and vintners are expecting yet another excellent vintage, the third year in a row in the region,"" the association reported. Vintners who have quake-damaged equipment or facilities can contact the association to find ""temporary tanks and other production equipment to help them get through the next few weeks."" Most of the valley is operating normally, Napa City Manager Mike Parness said at a Sunday news conference. ""I've been getting a lot of calls from people from outside the area that were planning on coming here, (who) are worried about it for fear this is some kind of disaster area, which means they can't come here and enjoy the valley,"" he said.  ""Conditions will be vastly improved over the next few days as we get on top of this."" California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who owns his own wineries, echoed that sentiment in an interview with CNN. ""I have a winemaker down the street from us -- they were devastated. Dozens and dozens of their barrels collapsed,"" he said. ""My winery, for instance, no barrels collapsed."" Parness encouraged visitors to check with their hotels and then make a judgment call about visiting. ""Most of the places in the valley have not been impacted,"" he said. Tourists are key to Napa Valley's economic health. The region's nearly 3 million annual visitors generate some $1.4 billion yearly in direct tourism spending, according to the 2012 Napa Valley Economic Impact Study. The 13,409 travelers who visit daily together spend an average of $3.82 million. While the Visit Napa Valley tourism office says that most businesses are open as usual, the group noted that some historic downtown Napa businesses had been damaged. The group is keeping a growing list of open businesses on its website, but officials also suggested calling first to confirm your plans. ""It appears the majority of the damage was centered on specific areas in the city of Napa,"" the bureau said, in a press statement. ""The regions around Yountville, St. Helena and Calistoga seem to have experienced minimal damage and disruption."" Everyone at Peju Winery, just north of Napa in Rutherford, made it through the earthquake without any injuries or damage, the company said. ""To all of our guests who are wondering, all of us at Peju Winery are fine,"" according to Peju's Facebook page. ""Peju is open for business today (Sunday) and we look forward to seeing you soon!""","This year's Napa grape harvest not damaged by earthquake .

"(CNN) -- Them's fightin' words, Anthony Daniels. In a tweet on Sunday, the once and forever C-3PO of ""Star Wars"" threw down a gauntlet: "" 'No movie sequel is better than The Empire Strikes Back.'

The new ""Star Wars"" is due out December 18, 2015, and if Daniels' opinion means anything, it'll be more highly thought-of than Episode V, ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" which has long been hailed as the best of the ""Star Wars"" movies -- and one of the best sequels of all time. In fact, in a reader poll for the British magazine Empire, it was voted the best movie ever, period. (Take that, ""Citizen Kane""!) Of course, viewers are fickle, and tastes change. Just four years earlier, Empire ranked ""Empire"" just the sixth-best sequel, behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Godfather Part II,"" among others. ""Aliens"" took the top spot in that list. And both ""Godfather II"" and ""Dark Knight,"" as well as the final chapter of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" rank higher than ""Empire"" on the Internet Movie Database's list. But never you mind.

"Choosing the right Valentine's Day gift can be tricky. Is your paramour into the the textbook red roses and box of chocolates, or would they prefer a romantic home-cooked meal? When in doubt, ask the Internet. Google has combed through recent search trends to get an idea of what people are thinking this Valentine's Day. (It's on Thursday, folks, in case it slipped your mind. Better get busy.) According to Google, in the past 30 days, more people were looking for gift ideas for the special men in their life than for wives or girlfriends. Wooing with gifts appears to be a bigger priority for couples in the early stages of a relationship. There were 59% more searches for ""gifts for girlfriend"" than ""gifts for wife"" and 292% more searches for ""gifts for boyfriend"" than for ""gifts for husband."" Then again, maybe men are just trickier to shop for on Valentine's Day, and after a few years of marriage, people know their significant other's preferences cold and don't need the assistance of a search engine. When it comes to gifts, flowers and food are still the dominant choices, though there are some signs of creativity in recent search terms. The most popular flower searches after roses were orchids, lilies, tulips and carnations. In the sweets category, plain old chocolate is the most popular, but milk chocolate was 37% more popular than dark chocolate in the past month. During that same period, the number of searches for ""heart shaped cake"" surged 4,900% and ""healthy chocolate"" 110%. How technology has changed romance . Popular foodie trends have infiltrated searches in the past year, with a 7% increase in searches for ""chocolate bacon cookies"" and a 5% boost for the term ""gluten free chocolate."" The unlikely search term ""Valentine beer"" had a 40% jump since last year. Going back to elementary school, Valentine's Day has been about the cards: First carefully crafted with safety scissors, construction paper and glue, and later bought pre-made from a store. But physical cards require thinking ahead, or at least swinging by a Walgreens on the way to a date. Enter the e-card. One-third of American adults plan on sending an e-card this Valentine's Day, according to a recent study by the mobile testing company SOASTA. Digital cards are most popular with men between 35 and 44, and spouses were the most common recipients. People were far less likely to send an e-card to their boyfriends or girlfriends, perhaps because they were too busy buying them chocolate bacon cookies and roses. Most of the romantics sending e-cards didn't plan on spending all that time filling out e-mail addresses and typing a message without expecting something in return. Thirty-five percent of people sending an e-card to a current or potential love interest expected a thank you, 19% were hoping to get an e-card right back, and 10% were expecting sex, according to the SOASTA study. However people are demonstrating their feelings, it's looking like a good year for love, according to Google's stats. Queries for tips on how to propose spiked 66% in the past month, especially in California, New York and Texas. Since last year, searches for ""how to break up"" are down 15%, ""breakup advice"" dropped 33%, and searches for ""divorce"" are down a heart-warming 41%. Finally, not all gifts this Valentine's Day are for people. Google found that ""gifts for dogs"" was a popular search in the past month.

"Big, bright and bubbly -- comedian Ross Mathews never apologizes for who he is. Between duties as a ""Tonight Show"" correspondent and guest appearances on E!'s late-night talk show ""Chelsea Lately,"" the 33-year-old covers a lot of ground in the 200-plus pages of his new memoir ""Man Up!"" He shares with readers the story of how he came out to his parents and why overcoming personal insecurities, like his high-pitched voice, were key to his success. Ahead of his memoir's May 7 release, Mathews sat down with CNN to share a few juicy details and explain why he's not leaving anything out. CNN: In your book, you say you always knew you'd write a memoir. You've been in the business for a little over a decade, so why did you decide to do it now? Mathews: As I was working in Hollywood and sort of amassing these stories I thought, 'Remember all of this. Write it down.' It just felt like the right time. Especially with Chelsea's (Handler) success in the literary world, when she heard I wanted to write a book she said 'I want to publish this.' It just felt like the perfect time. CNN: You divulge more than a few secrets in the book. Was there anything that you held back or something you thought twice about before printing? Mathews: Well, you know this book is about me, and the world through my eyes. If I didn't tell every story -- the ones where I was a hero and the ones where I wasn't a hero -- then there was no point in telling it. The only time I ever held back is when it was about someone else. I didn't want to throw anybody else under the bus, but I definitely bear everything out about me. I mean there's nothing off limits in the book. I mean, I tell every sordid detail of my life -- the pretty and the not-so-pretty. CNN: You said that you got your start, in part, because of an attribute you were once ashamed of, your voice. How has that shaped who you are today? Mathews: (Laughs) OK, listen, at a certain point I just had to realize puberty d*cked me over. So I just said, 'Use it! Shake your moneymaker.' My brother used to make fun of me, people in school used to make fun of me and I just realized one day that this is the card you've been dealt, use it to your advantage. And when I did that, everything changed for me. CNN: A lot of kids and, let's face it, adults struggle with their insecurities. At what point in your life, did you decide you were going to let go? Mathews: I don't know if I can mark the day. I remember feeling it happening, though. It was when I found really great friends in school. Suddenly, I had those moments where I forgot to be insecure. Sometimes I'd catch myself and be like 'God, I wish I could be like this all the time.' So I just eventually began challenging myself to feel that way. And not to be too preachy, but I would really recommend to people, if you get the chance, to trust yourselves to leap without a net, because that will build the confidence. You know, you might shock yourself with how much you don't need a net because you can catch yourself. CNN: You decided to make the very last chapter of the book about the day you realized you were gay. Was there a reason behind that? Mathews: That was very much on purpose. Again, I define 'man up' as you are what you are. Love yourself, whatever makes you different, and use it to make you stand out. Mine is my voice and the fact that I'm gay, well, the fact that I'm flamboyantly gay. But I didn't want the book to only be about that. I am a gay man, but it's not only a gay story. Whatever people have to 'man up' about, that's their own version. It can be big ears, skin color, freckles, acne, whatever it is, mine is what it was. It's a universal message. You know, everybody, everybody has that thing that makes them question their worth, their importance, and, you know, this book speaks to that in each of us. CNN: What's the one thing you hope readers take away from your book? Mathews: The most important thing to take away, if you step back, is that all these stories -- celebrity stories, stories about being caught stealing clothes from a women's store in the mall -- every one of these stories has a common thread which is:  I never compromised who I was. And when I did, I made sure I never did it again. People should never apologize for who they are and they should never hide who they are. Hating yourself is so 2011. CNN: If you could interview anyone now, who would it be? Mathews: I would like to sit down with Oprah, just because I'd like to talk to her. I want to sit down and like, converse. Like, 'Honey, let's chat!' Actually, just put that in the story. I'm asking if anybody reading this has Oprah's e-mail or number, just call her or text her about the book! Do Uncle Ross a solid. CNN: You started one of the last chapters by saying that one person can change the world. Do you really believe that? And if so, what's the one thing you would change? Mathews: Listen, I know it's true because I've lived it, and I've done it, OK? I brought butternut squash back. There was a restaurant, they took an item off, I fought, they brought it back, and they named it after me, OK? And I'm just one person. And of course it's silly to say that it's changing the world, but it's just an example. It's the little things you do to say, 'No I'm not going to stand for that! I'm not going to stand for it!' Those little things add up. CNN: Is there any other societal issue that weighs heavily on your mind? Mathews: Yes. I think if I record a program, we have got to have the technology where I could record something on my DVR and like, e-mail it to a friend. I know this is lame, but why haven't they invented that yet?!?!","Ross Mathews doubles as ""Tonight Show"" correspondent and ""Chelsea Lately"" guest .

"Sometimes geography gets in the way of power politics. Just when you thought that Ukraine was miles away from Syria, bang -- you find out that they're actually bordering each other. Confused? I bet you are. But here's the deal: the civil war in Ukraine, which most sensible people tend to classify these days as a direct stand-off between Russia and the U.S., is now having a direct impact on the conflict in Syria. The so-called ""Islamic State"" (ISIS) -- it's better to keep it in quotation marks and add ""so-called,"" so as not to give these terrorists legitimacy -- has emerged as a force that has created a so-called caliphate and vows to spread its borders way beyond Syria and Iraq, where it is currently operating. Russia is supporting President Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, while America and its allies are backing the anti-government rebels there -- some of whom have at some point developed into ISIS and started to get all sorts of crazy ideas. Since it is Assad's troops who are actually doing the fighting on the ground against ISIS and since it so happens that this new menace is now the number one target of America, it follows that Ukraine is very close to Syria when it comes to international power-play. This week, out of the blue, the already-disbanded Ukrainian parliament voted to provide special status for Donetsk and Lugansk -- the two rebellious regions in eastern Ukraine -- offering them autonomy for three years and allowing them to hold their own elections for their local authorities, in addition to offering an amnesty for people who have not been directly involved in fighting Ukrainian government troops. Initially this was received with caution in Moscow -- especially given what has been going on for the past nine months in Ukraine -- but if that is not a signal from Barack Obama that he is ready to play ball with Russia, then I don't know what is. The view in Moscow is that the Obama Administration is telling the Kremlin that it needs help in dealing with ISIS. But as it can't just say it publicly, it is using Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to do the honors. I am told that the initial reaction in the Kremlin to Obama's plan to fight ISIS was not exactly a kind one. The suspicion was that Washington, together with its allies, was planning to use the campaign against ISIS in Syria to dispose of Assad through the back door, so to speak. An anti-terrorist operation targeted at ISIS ""gets out of control"" and all sorts of wrong targets get hit, like, say, Syrian army positions. One thing leads to another and, lo and behold, we have Assad going down the route of Colonel Gadhafi, and Syria descends into the same kind of chaos that is now gripping Libya. But after the ""border"" between Ukraine and Syria emerged all of a sudden, that attitude is changing. But the broad anti-ISIS coalition that Obama is hoping to build is not exactly shaping up as planned. Turkey is openly hesitant to get involved, and the Saudis are not exactly over the moon with the whole concept. So Obama's best bet to get the ball rolling, as it is now seen from Moscow, would be to discreetly work with Russia. Although it may be tempting for Washington to overthrow Assad, such a move could backfire on the White House, giving ISIS a boost instead of a kick and turning those pesky U.S. midterm elections into a total nightmare for the Democrats. (Incidentally, Russian experts believe that Obama will lose the Senate and will being to resemble a late-term Bill Clinton, who improved his golf swing dramatically in his last years in office.) So it made sense for Washington to wave the white flag -- albeit a very small one -- at the expense of the Ukrainian regime in Kiev, in order to signal to the Kremlin that it is time to do some business together. Russian President Vladimir Putin has his own plan for Syria. Sergey Lavrov, his top diplomat, has made a point of stressing the point that without the Syrian regime on board, any attempt to defeat ISIS won't work. A similar scenario to the one that had been used to prevent the U.S. bombing Syria last year is shaping up nicely in Moscow. Russia will ask the U.S. to cooperate with Assad in the battle against ISIS, without the Syrian President having to fear that he might be bumped off along the way. The hawks in Washington might not like this script, but hey, stranger things have happened in power politics in the past. What will Putin ask for in return for helping to defeat ISIS? That's the question that is probably being mulled over in the White House as you read this. Well, it just so happens that sorting out the mess in eastern Ukraine is Putin's personal project -- just like Syria was last year. He will want some sort of guarantee that Kiev will stick to the new deal about the special status of Donetsk and Lugansk which should help calm things down in the eastern provinces, at least until next spring. That would be a deal that the Kremlin would consider worthwhile. But the funniest thing of all is that the ""broad coalition"" Obama proposed may never see the light of day -- and at that point, the only countries that will actually be able to help the U.S. fight ISIS would be Iraq, Iran, Syria and Russia, with the latter mostly providing the weaponry to the Syrians. Which is not really all that surprising if you consider how closely Ukraine and Syria are intertwined. READ MORE: Opinion: Should U.S. arm Ukraine?

"The UK has become one of the latest Western countries to enter the coalition fighting ISIS, with Parliament voting Friday to endorse British military engagement in Iraq through airstrikes. The vote came shortly after Prime Minister David Cameron's speech during the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, in which he emphasized the threat posed by ISIS to the UK and endorsed military action based on ""careful preparation"" while saying ""no to rushing to join a conflict without a clear plan."" In doing so, the UK appears to want to redeem itself after the blunders of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Yet entering the conflict through airstrikes in Iraq is in itself an indication of the lack of a clear plan on part of the UK in particular and the anti-ISIS coalition as a whole. As it currently stands, the coalition's plan carries a high risk of backfiring. The UK is basing its involvement in Iraq on the legitimacy granted by the democratically elected Iraqi government's request for international intervention to aid it in fighting ISIS, a scenario that cannot be duplicated in Syria. But ISIS has set roots in both Syria and Iraq, and has erased the border between the two countries in areas under its control. To limit any action against ISIS, whether military or otherwise, to Iraq alone is therefore meaningless. Focusing on airstrikes as a key method of military engagement is also ineffective. ISIS knew very well that no Western country would want to commit boots on the ground in Syria or Iraq, and prepared to defend itself accordingly. Before the coalition's campaign began, ISIS bases in Raqqa and elsewhere were evacuated and the group's members went underground. The raids that have been conducted to date have led to little actual damage to ISIS' military capability, according to one of my informants on the ground there. If anything, they have played right into the hands of its strategy. This strategy is based on engaging in a defensive, asymmetrical war, which, as the examples of Hamas and Hezbollah have shown, is a good bet for militant groups with limited capabilities confronting larger conventional armies. ISIS also invited military action against it in order to legitimize its narrative of fighting a war against ""crusades."" This narrative has now been strengthened, especially with many of those killed during the strikes being civilians. The more civilians die, the higher the resentment against the coalition, and the more attractive ISIS becomes to potential recruits. Airstrikes will not sever people's ties with ISIS. The attraction of ISIS to its recruits is not merely ideological. It is based on seeking revenge for economic, social, and political grievances as well as the pursuit of power and money, but also a sense of belonging to a grand project, which is the establishment of a Caliphate. Now that a Caliphate has been declared, even in rudimentary form, the most airstrikes can achieve is the containment of ISIS through limiting its ability to expand geographically, but not its eradication. Without a political and economic plan tackling the motivations driving ISIS sympathizers within Syria and Iraq and globally, limited military action will keep ISIS alive and open the door to retaliation. With an increasing number of ISIS jihadists hailing from the UK, British involvement in the air raid campaign translates into increased threat to UK security. The risk of retaliation extends to all countries involved in the anti-ISIS coalition. Although the anti-ISIS coalition has been crystalizing for some time, what it's pursuing is far from a carefully planned strategy. In addition to the risks highlighted above, a glaring gap is a political strategy for Syria that would prevent the country from descending into the kind of chaos witnessed in Libya. Also absent is a regional security strategy for neighboring countries like Jordan and the Gulf states, which have entered the coalition nervously and are worried about their own stability now that they are in direct confrontation with ISIS. There were several measures -- from diplomatic pressure to strengthening the Syrian opposition adequately -- that the international community could have taken two years ago, that would have prevented the Syrian crisis from escalating to the alarming level witnessed today. Military action as currently planned would have been much more effective back when ISIS was still in its infancy. Now that military action is a reality, instead of merely jumping on the bandwagon, the UK should use its position as a major European country and a key ally of the United States to push the coalition towards formulating a long-term strategy that is indeed comprehensive and that offers a realistic plan for what happens in Syria and Iraq the day after ISIS is eradicated. This would bolster the UK's international standing, better secure coalition countries, as well as prevent the coalition from repeating the mistakes of the past.","UK Parliament has voted in favor of Britain joining airstrikes in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Crews on Sunday sifted through debris of a concert stage that collapsed at the Indiana State Fair, trying to determine what caused the accident that killed five people and injured 40, authorities said. The fairgrounds were closed Sunday as investigators began the search for answers. The state fair was expected to reopen to the public Monday following a public memorial service to remember those who were killed and injured, said Cindy Hoyne, the fair's executive director. Forecasters warned heavy rain and strong winds would hit the fair nearly two hours before the storm moved through, causing the collapse of the stage Saturday night. The National Weather Service estimated winds at 60 to 70 mph. Metal scaffolding fell onto the ""Sugarpit,"" a section usually occupied by Sugarland's most ardent fans, about four minutes after authorities took the stage to warn the crowd to seek shelter, according to a timeline of events released by investigators Sunday. ""It's not clear to me at this stage how anyone could have foreseen a sudden, highly localized gust of wind in one place,"" Gov. Mitch Daniels said. Video shows the blue canvas top fraying and flapping just seconds before the steel scaffolding gave way, sending a heavy bank of stage lights and metal onto fans closest to the outdoor stage. Gov. Daniels described the collapse as a ""freakish accident."" Sugarland, an Atlanta-based country duo, escaped injury since they had not yet come onstage.  They later posted a message on Twitter saying they were ""stunned and heartbroken for the fans."" The group -- along with its opening act, Sara Bareilles -- cancelled their scheduled performance Sunday night at the Iowa State Fair. According to the fair's website, ""aside from coping with the magnitude of the accident, the ongoing investigation prevents the band from getting what may remain of their stage equipment."" Jennifer Nettles, one half of the Sugarland duo, posted a statement on the group's web site Sunday, saying ""there are no words to process a moment of this magnitude and gravity."" ""There are only prayers for peace in the hearts of the bereft, and prayers of thanksgiving for those who were spared or safe. A piece of our heart is left in that grandstand,"" Nettles said. Sara Bareilles, who had just finished her performance when the collapse occurred, tweeted Sunday she was still thinking of all those affected."" On her web site, she wrote:  ""The accident at the Indiana State Fair felt like a bad dream. The weather changed in a matter of minutes and the stage collapsed in a matter of seconds. "" She called the emergency response ""incredibly quick."" While most of the injured were treated and released from Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital, nine patients were admitted and still being treated Sunday afternoon, the hospital said.  Three children remained at Riley Hospital for Children, the hospital said. The Marion County, Indiana, coroner identified the three women and two men who died as: Tammy Vandam, 42, of Wanatah, Indiana; Glenn Goodrich, 49, of Indianapolis; Alina Bigjohny, 23, of Fort Wayne, Indiana; Christina Santiago, 29, of Chicago; and Nathan Byrd, 51, of Indianapolis. Vandam, Goodrich, Bigjohny and Santiago were dead at the scene, while Byrd died later at the hospital, the coroner said. Friends, colleagues and family gathered Sunday to remember Santiago at Chicago's Howard Brown Health Center, a health care organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, where she worked. ""We have lost a fierce warrior, an amazing activist,"" said Rosa Yadira Ortiz, board president for Amigas Latinos, a group for lesbian Hispanics in Chicago that Santiago was involved in. ""She really brought us all together."" The families of two of those hospitalized released brief statements Sunday, each asking for prayers and privacy. ""Jenny Haskell, a 22-year-old Ball State senior, is very critical at this time,"" her family said. A fifth-grader, identified only as Jade, is in critical condition, according to her family. ""A big gust of wind came through. You could see a lot of people panicking,"" said Aaron Richman, who witnessed the collapse at the fair in Indianapolis. ""All the scaffolding and speakers -- all that came crashing down -- and the whole stand just collapsed."" Allison Hoehn, another concertgoer, said many attendees rushed to those trapped after the stage crumbled. ""We tried to get down to help, but no one was moving,"" Hoehn said. ""The storm came on so fast and the stage just snapped like a toothpick."" Spectators grabbed parts of their seats to assemble makeshift stretchers, Hoehn said. ""Everyone rushed to help, and we saw people searching and pulling people out,"" she said. ""(I) saw five people go away on stretchers. It was amazing how many people ran in to try to lift the scaffolding."" Capt. Brad Weaver, commander of special operations for the Indiana State Police, said he took the stage at 8:45 p.m. to warn the audience of severe weather. Weaver said he ""saw the framework from the stage start to come over."" He said he and others took cover behind a trailer, which was also struck by debris from the stage. Weaver said authorities were in the process of issuing an evacuation order, but Hoehn said no one told the crowd at the concert to evacuate. Earlier this month, severe weather caused a stage to collapse before a Flaming Lips performance in Oklahoma. The August 6 incident occurred after heavy winds and rain pounded Tulsa, ending a block party music festival that featured Primus, the Flaming Lips and other acts. A lighting rig fell down and struck audio equipment and instruments. It was unclear whether there were any injuries. And last month, a severe storm toppled a stage when classic rock band Cheap Trick was performing. No one was seriously hurt during the incident at the Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest in Canada. CNN's Alan Duke, Chelsea J. Carter, Leslie Tripp and David Williams contributed to this report.","NEW: The state fair will reopen Monday following a service, a fair official says .

"The convicted mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing wants nearly two decades of communication restrictions lifted, arguing he's no longer a threat to national security, his lawyer said Sunday. Ramzi Yousef has been locked away in solitary confinement at the federal ""Supermax"" prison in Florence, Colorado, since 1998. A 15-page list of rules sets limits on his contact with relatives, lawyers and other inmates. He can read books and watch television, but newspapers and magazines are censored to keep him from receiving messages planted in classified ads or letters to the editor. Now 44, Yousef ""no longer should be considered a national security threat,"" his lawyer, Bernard Kleinman, told CNN. ""If the government feels that he is, they should provide some reasonable basis that they can corroborate as to why he is a continuing national security threat."" U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy, who sentenced Yousef to life plus 20 years, called him ""a virus that must be locked away."" He was arrested in 1996 in a plot to bomb U.S. airliners in Asia, and he's the nephew of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed -- the accused mastermind of the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 people and brought down the World Trade Center. He went to court in 2011 to ask that the Justice Department's ""special administrative measures"" that restrict his contact be lifted. Kleinman said that other than the al Qaeda defendants facing trial at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ""there's nobody who's treated as a greater national security threat in the federal prison system than Yousef."" The Justice Department, which has kept those restrictions on Yousef since 1997, argues that Yousef is trying to find a back-door route out of solitary. Kleinman said getting out of solitary could be ""the effective end result"" of Yousef's case, but it's not the immediate goal. ""The goal is to find out why he is subject to these special conditions,"" he said. In a 2011 ruling, Duffy wrote that while Yousef was awaiting trial, he had been trying to collect urea -- a component of urine -- and a type of watch that had been used in a detonator in the airline bomb plot. But Kleinman said that while his client was a smart man, ""That doesn't mean that he could turn lead into gold."" ""The federal government has viewed for years that he has this almost mystical ability to fabricate weapons or bombs almost out of thin air,"" Kleinman said. ""There's never been any evidence of that whatsoever."" Duffy, who had sentenced Yousef to prison, referred the case to a judge in Colorado, where it's now pending. In January, the Justice Department argued the case should be dismissed on procedural grounds.","Ramzi Yousef has had his communications restricted since 1997 .

"In July, Iran lost one of its most acclaimed playwrights and directors when Mahmoud Ostad-Mohammad passed away in Tehran at the age of 62. Scores of relatives, friends, and theater lovers attended his funeral ceremony that was adorned with pictures of Ostad-Mohammad -- his trademark mustache and playful smile on display. Some wept while embracing copies of his famous screenplays. Among the mourners was Ostad-Mohammad's daughter, Mana, who is convinced that Western sanctions against Iran were partly to blame for his father's passing. ""This was the doctor's testimony,"" said Mana Ostad-Mohammad. ""This is based on my father's medical tests."" Through five decades, some of the most famous Iranian plays were brought to life by Ostad-Mohammad. Some were Iranian classics. Others were originals.  All were stories about the loves and losses of everyday Iranians. Then in 2011, came a diagnosis of late-stage liver cancer. Surgery was not an option, but Ostad-Mohammad's oncologist prescribed the cancer drug Nexavar. According to his doctor and medical tests, the drug appeared to stop the cancer from spreading. ""We were very hopeful that if he gets through this stage, he could get healthy and start living his life again,"" said his daughter Mana. But beginning last year -- soon after Washington and Western powers imposed additional sanctions against Iran to rein in its nuclear program -- Iranian doctors, pharmacists and patients say finding Nexavar and several other drugs that treated deadly diseases became increasingly difficult. Western powers have stepped up the pressure on Iran since 2006, when the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to impose new sanctions for Tehran's failure to suspend its nuclear program. The European Union imposed further sanctions last year. U.S. officials have long said medical goods are exempt from the measures and that Western sanctions are specifically designed to target the government, not ordinary Iranians. But Iranian officials say with the Western ban on Iranian banks doing business with much of the outside world, even medical goods that are exempt from the sanctions are often impossible to import. ""We have a serious shortage of drugs due to high prices or because they're impossible to purchase,"" says Tehran-based pharmacist Imen Heirani. Heirani said everyday he gets as many as 30 calls a day from patients looking for hard-to-find drugs. ""They're obviously tired because they've been searching for a while."" Mana was getting tired too. This year, finding Nexavar -- the drug that helped keep her father alive -- became harder than ever. ""It was very unexpected,"" said Mana. ""For 18 months we could easily get the drug but now we couldn't. We didn't know what to do."" Searching for the drug became Mana's daily mission. If pharmacies in Tehran didn't have Nexavar, Mana would open her phone book and start dialing pharmacies in other Iranian cities like Tabriz, Isfahan and Mashad. But last March finding Nexavar became virtually impossible, she says. Medical tests then showed her father's feto-protein level -- an indicator of cancer -- skyrocketed over the four months he went without Nexavar. On July 25, Ostad-Mohammad lost his fight with cancer. Iran lost a beloved playwright. And a daughter lost a father who she believes was a victim of Western sanctions and a political conflict that had nothing to do with him. ""More than being angry, I think about how simple-minded politicians are,"" she said. ""Sanctions are impacting the people, not the groups politicians say they're impacting.""","Iranians say access to life-saving drugs is difficult because of Western sanctions .

"Here we go: A new round of confrontation between the White House and Congress over the federal budget is in the offing, this time in a new attempt to avert the looming ""sequestration"" process. What is sequestration? It's a series of automatic, across-the-board cuts to government agencies, totaling $1.2 trillion over 10 years. The cuts would be split 50-50 between defense and domestic discretionary spending. It's all part of attempts to get a handle on the growth of the U.S. national debt, which exploded upward when the 2007 recession hit and now stands at more than $16 trillion. The sequester has been coming for more than a year, with Congress pushing it back to March 1 as part of the fiscal cliff deal at the end of the last session. By the numbers: Recent defense spending . Why does this seem familiar? It started with the 2011 standoff over the U.S. debt ceiling, when Republicans in Congress demanded spending cuts in exchange for giving the Obama administration the needed legal headroom to pay the federal government's obligations to its bondholders. In the end, Congress and the administration agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts. About $1 trillion of that was laid out in the debt-ceiling bill and the rest imposed through sequestration -- a kind of fiscal doomsday device that Congress would have to disarm by coming up with an equal amount of spending reductions elsewhere. What were they thinking? The plan was that a special congressional panel, dubbed the ""super committee,"" would find a less painful way to cut spending. It failed in November 2011. That left federal agencies facing what outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called ""legislative madness"" in the form of harsh cuts that no one wanted. ""For those of you who have ever seen 'Blazing Saddles,' it is the scene of the sheriff putting the gun to his head in order to establish law and order,"" Panetta said in a speech at Washington's Georgetown University. ""That is sequestration."" But for many conservatives, sequestration is a feature, not a bug. It's ""the first chance we have for real savings and deficit reduction,"" the tea party-aligned lobbying group FreedomWorks tells supporters on its website. ""President Obama already agreed to the sequester savings when he signed the debt ceiling bargain into law,"" FreedomWorks says. ""He needs to follow through."" Military pay in play in game of political poker . Where will the cuts fall? More than $500 billion will be cut from the Defense Department and other national security agencies, with the rest cut on the domestic side -- national parks, federal courts, the FBI, food inspections and housing aid. While the Pentagon has laid out plans ranging from furloughs of hundreds of thousands of civilian workers to combat readiness training and weapons maintenance, the White House budget office hasn't specified which domestic agencies would take the biggest hits. Panetta says that the $46 billion in spending cuts for 2013 would cut sharply into military readiness -- and the longer the cuts are pushed back, the deeper they'll have to be to achieve the required savings. Opinion: Republicans, be smart about defense cuts . So now what? Congress put off the sequester until March 1 as part of the last-minute fiscal cliff deal on New Year's Day. Without that agreement, economists warned that the one-two punch of sequestration and the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts could have thrown a still-struggling U.S. economy into reverse. Even with the fiscal cliff deal, the austerity moves already were slowing the economy, Obama suggested over the weekend. The Commerce Department said a large cut in federal spending, primarily on defense, contributed to the 0.1% decrease in gross domestic product seen in the last quarter of 2012. ""Washington cannot continually operate under a cloud of crisis. That freezes up consumers,"" Obama said during a pre-Super Bowl interview with CBS. ""It gets businesses worried. We can't afford these self-inflicted wounds."" How our tribes cause gridlock in Congress . Tuesday, Obama urged Congress to pass a short-term deal that puts off the cuts, allowing some breathing room for a long-term deficit reduction plan. But Obama said any deal should include more revenue from ending some tax breaks -- a stance that inflamed Republicans who already had to swallow a tax increase for top earners in the fiscal cliff deal. ""I don't like the sequester. I think it's taking a meat ax to our government, a meat ax to many programs that will weaken our national defense,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. But, he added, ""Americans do not support sacrificing real spending cuts for more tax hikes.""","Obama, Congress try to avert automatic budget cuts .

"Libyans poured into the streets Thursday to celebrate the death of  Moammar Gadhafi. After months of intense fighting, rebel fighters finally overran Gadhafi's last stronghold in his hometown of Sirte, marking the end of his 42-year rule. Although Gadhafi's rule effectively ended two months ago when he fled Tripoli, his death provides closure and a sense of relief to many in the country who had opposed his tyrannical rule. It also greatly reduces the likelihood of a prolonged insurgency by Gadhafi loyalists and allows the transitional government to move forward with the hard work of building a new political system. The challenges ahead are great: Since the Gadhafi regime so effectively monopolized the public sphere, Libya has no real civil society or effective political institutions. After decades of tyranny, there is a deep distrust of government. There is also fear of revenge killings by those who suffered under Gadhafi's brutality. Tensions are already evident between Islamists and secularists, and between technocrats returning from abroad and those who stayed and opposed the regime at enormous personal expense. Well-armed militias have yet to be formally disbanded or integrated into a national army; large caches of arms, including some sophisticated missiles, are not accounted for and could end up in the hands of extremists. Nevertheless, of all the Arab states that have been convulsed by revolts this year, Libya has by far the strongest economic prospects. Its relatively small population of 6.5 million and vast oil wealth give it the best chance of meeting the economic aspirations of its citizens. Just recently, the transitional government announced that it had discovered an additional $23 billion  in the Central Bank of Libya, enough to cover the costs of government for at least six months. It has an additional $160 billion in foreign assets, which are  frozen overseas but will eventually be released. Libya also has a relatively well-educated population. Public education was free and compulsory through secondary school under Gadhafi, and the country enjoys a literacy rate of nearly 90%. In the 2007-2008 school year, women enrolled in universities outnumbered men significantly. According to the Transitional National Council constitution, legislative and presidential elections to form a new government must be held within a year of liberation. The constitution also stipulates that no member of the council can participate in this newly elected government, a provision meant to limit the influence of the interim body. So far, transitional leaders seem willing to abide by that provision, but jockeying for power has only just begun. Interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jabril, American educated and unabashedly secular, announced recently that he would step down at the close of the fighting, but it is not clear if he will follow through on his promise, or if he does, who will succeed him. Jabril and Ali Tarhouni, the acting Finance and Oil Minister who was teaching economics in the United States before joining the rebellion, have been criticized for being outsiders, too secular and too connected to remnants of the former regime. Some are pointing to Abdel Hakim Belhaj, the NTC commander of the militia in Tripoli, as a major player in the future political field. Belhaj was arrested in 2004 by the Central Intelligence Agency and rendered to Libya, where he was held and tortured in the infamous Abu Salim prison. The warrant for his arrest accused him of ties to al Qaeda, which he has denied. Belhaj has also disavowed extremism and pledged tolerance. Islamists will undoubtedly play an influential role in Libya's new government, and outward signs of Islamic piety, suppressed under Gadhafi, are now on the rise across the country. But leaders across the political spectrum continue to insist on moderation and tolerance. Mustafa Abdul Jalil, chairman of the transitional council, has called for a Libyan state founded on Sharia that is also inclusive of women and minorities. U.S. and European support for the rebels over the past seven months generated positive feelings among Libyans for NATO countries, which points to a possible Western-aligned Libyan government that is nonetheless markedly Islamic in character. Gadhafi's death marks an important moment of transition for Libyans. Reconciliation and integration will be imperative at this point, especially as the dust of war clears and evidence emerges of brutality committed by both rebel forces and Gadhafi loyalists. As demonstrated painfully in Iraq, lasting stability requires opportunities for Gadhafi supporters to participate in the new order, but with war wounds still fresh, this will require remarkable leadership and forbearance on the part of transitional leaders. A stable, prosperous Libya undergoing a process of democratization will enhance the chance of successful transitions in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt.  This helps explain the sense of jubilation across the region that erupted on the news of Gadhafi's death. The era of tyrants seems to be coming to an end. Protesters in Syria and Yemen held out signs asking their leaders if they want to go the same violent way.","Isobel Coleman: Libya best positioned economically of Arab Spring nations .

"Amid leaden wintry skies, it may come as a surprise to Londoners but new figures suggest the city has beaten its arch rival, Paris, to become the world's most popular city for tourists. However, a growing spat between the the two cities' administrations suggests that, when it comes to comparisons between London and Paris, there are only lies, damn lies and statistics. Figures released this week by the UK's Office for National Statistics show that 4.9 million people visited London from July to September 2013. That was an increase of 20% on the same period in the previous year -- during which London hosted the Olympics -- and a new quarterly record. Taking a wider view, for the first nine months of 2013, 12.8 million visitors flocked to the British capital, an increase of 12% compared with the previous year. The figures prompted the city's promotional body, London and Partners, to proclaim that London was ""on course to welcome over 16 million visitors in one year."" That in turn has led to reports in Britain and abroad that London has trumped Paris as the most visited city in the world. The two cities have actually swapped the top spot on various lists in recent years. According to the MasterCard Global Destinations Cities Index for 2012, London narrowly beat out Paris for the top spot with 16.9 million visitors. 'Greatest city on the planet' For the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, the statistics only underlined the obvious. ""These incredible figures prove that London is without doubt the greatest city on the planet,"" he said. ""With so many fascinating museums, the best theater scene in the world, more green space than any other European city, numerous top sporting venues, a low crime rate and much else besides, it's no wonder that people from all over the globe are flocking to London in record numbers."" A long, hot summer, Andy Murray's Wimbledon win, the birth of Prince George and blockbuster West Ends shows including ""The Book of Mormon"" were put forward as potential reasons for the surge in tourist numbers, along with the legacy of the Olympics from the year before. Top London attractions such as the Tower of London and St. Paul's Cathedral said visitor numbers were ""through the roof"" last summer, with an increase of 17% on 2012, the London Evening Standard reported. St. Paul's welcomed 353,463 visitors between May and August, up by almost half on 2012. Spat turns nasty . All pretty impressive, but it turns out that the source of London's promotion to top tourist spot was none other than ... French. Proclaiming ""London dethrones Paris,"" the conservative daily Le Figaro had compared London's projected 16 million visitors with a 2012 figure of 15.9 million visitors to Paris. Things have only got nastier since. Seizing on the comparison, Paris's right wing mayoral candidate, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, claimed the numbers showed Paris's Socialist administration as failing the city. That's just Paris bashing, one of those Socialists, Paris's deputy mayor Anne Hidalgo, retorted. Other figures, her office said, revealed Paris still to be beating the sprawling, unsophisticated pretender over La Manche when it comes to pulling in tourists. Indeed, London is in some ways just a ""suburb"" of the far more attractive French capital, she told reporters. Paris 'still No. 1' ""Like it or not, while London may have attracted more visitors around the Olympic Games, Paris remains the number one world tourist destination, even if we only include foreign visitors and not national ones,"" Hidalgo said. London was ""boastful"" about its strengths, even deceptive, whereas the French were ""rational"" in their self assessments. ""London aggressively sells itself ... in a way that goes beyond the truth. We are more rational in our communication when speaking about Paris's strengths,"" Hidalgo said. In 2012, 29 million domestic and foreign tourists visited the wider city of Paris, Hidalgo's office said. By contrast, Greater London -- 10 times larger -- pulled in only 27.6 million tourists of all nationalities. While clearly superior intellectually to Londoners, Parisians could, Hidalgo conceded, appear ""arrogant."" ""We could be a bit more amiable,"" she said. ""I often tell people they must smile more. It costs nothing."" Gordon Ramsay weighs in . Parisian spluttering be damned, London and Partners has used its figures to promote a new video campaign, The London Story, in which well known Londoners reveal what they most love about the city. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay says: ""You can't beat a good London curry. I've been to India but I find curries in Brick Lane [in the East End] better. It's not just curries. ""There's nowhere better in the world to eat than in London,"" says Ramsay. ""A great thing about London is shopping,"" adds Sixties It girl Twiggy. ""What girl doesn't love shopping? London is the best -- we've always been the best in fashion.""","Figures show London beating Paris as most visited city by tourists last year .

"(CNN) -- Court proceedings began Tuesday in a high-profile libel lawsuit that pits Ecuador's president against one of the nation's largest newspapers. Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa is seeking $80 million in damages from El Universo newspaper and its staff. He also wants a judge to impose three-year prison sentences on the newspaper's directors and its former opinion editor. A judge is scheduled to rule Friday in the case, which has drawn international attention from press-freedom advocates, who say Correa aims to crack down on critics by restricting the media. Correa filed the lawsuit after El Universo published in February a column by the newspaper's then-opinion editor, titled, ""No to lies."" The column called Correa a dictator and claimed that the president had ordered security forces to open fire at a hospital full of civilians last September. Correa said Tuesday that the article's claims were untrue, baseless and ""an outrage,"" according to the state-run El Ciudadano government information website. The president told reporters that he hopes the case will set a precedent. ""This fight is for true freedom of expression,"" he said, a concept that he said has become ""an excuse and cover for cowards who, behind an inkwell, think they can destroy others' honor."" Tuesday's court proceedings were closed to the media. Pedro Valverde, an attorney representing El Universo, told CNN en Español that the newspaper was not given an opportunity to fully present its side. ""The process is plagued with legal inconsistencies,"" he said. The newspaper remains ""faithful to its principle of freedom of expression,"" he said, arguing that the publication's policies indicate that its directors have no influence on the content of its columns. Emilio Palacio, the paper's former opinion editor, resigned from his post at El Universo last week, saying he was innocent but wanted the lawsuit to end. In March he told CNN en Español that he stood by his column. ""I confirm what I wrote, every letter,"" he said. On Tuesday the newspaper's directors offered to print a correction. ""Since it is impossible for us to correct assertions that were not ours -- and without being able to anticipate what correction would fit with what you are thinking -- we offer that you send us the text of the correction you demand in order to print it in El Universo, on the day and in the location that you require,"" they said in a letter to Correa posted on the paper's website. ""We hope that with this offer...you will end this trial,"" they concluded. Correa rejected the offer, noting that the newspaper already had plenty of time to print a correction, but had not done so. ""The moment of gentlemen, of people who have ethics, has already passed,"" he said, according to El Ciudadano. El Universo, an 89-year-old, family-run newspaper, is based in Ecuador's Guayaquil province. Its website showed pictures Tuesday of what it described as a demonstration supporting the publication and criticizing Correa. ""Today it is El Universo. Tomorrow it will be you,"" one demonstrator's sign said. Ecuador's government information website also showed images of a demonstration, saying Guayaquil residents were supporting Correa and his lawsuit. Protesters in a video posted on the site chanted ""Corrupt press, no more!"" Press-freedom advocates have criticized the case and other recent efforts to regulate media in Ecuador. In a statement Tuesday, the Inter American Press Association criticized ""the ongoing harassment of the Ecuador's independent press through excessive and disproportionate legal suits by President Rafael Correa."" The Committee to Protect Journalists also weighed in on the libel lawsuit shortly after Correa filed it. ""Ecuador's outdated criminal defamation provisions have been systematically used to punish critical journalists,"" the New York-based organization said in a March statement. CNN en Español's Fernando del Rincon contributed to this report.","Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa accuses El Universo of libel .

"She traveled the world with her husband for 22 months without major mishap, but a month after returning to the United States, Leanne Hecht Bearden is missing after she went for a walk. A search is under way in Texas, northeast of San Antonio, for the Denver woman who took a stroll almost a week ago and has not returned to her in-laws' residence where she and husband, Josh, were staying. ""While we are very concerned for Ms. Bearden's welfare, there is no indication at this time that this is criminal in nature,"" the Garden Ridge Police Department said in a statement. Bearden, 33, went missing Friday in the early afternoon, and police are encouraging the public to provide any information. While family and friends and say ""police are engaged"" in this case and are being ""diligent in their efforts,"" they have decided to take the search into their own hands and have hired private helicopters to help look for Bearden. Her brother, Michael Hecht, told CNN two helicopters searched for nearly three hours Thursday following ground searches the previous two days. ""It's baffling right now about what happened. Maybe she fell and hurt herself. You start thinking about things. I don't think she had any enemies. She is loved very much,"" Hecht said. Bearden and her husband had just returned to the United States in December after spending nearly two years traveling around the world. They documented their journey in a blog. She and her husband of four years were supposed to fly to their home in Denver on Tuesday to resume job searches. Hecht said upon returning to the United States the couple had spent a short time in Georgia, then went to Texas for a few weeks to visit Josh's family. He said they were working to find jobs in Denver, where the couple was married and had settled. ""Her poor husband is just devastated,"" said Hecht. Josh Bearden told CNN affiliate KENS-TV, ""She left on her own free will. That is what she did. That is absolutely true, but what happened after she left the house on her own free will I don't know."" Garden Ridge police have sent out a ""Missing Person Alert."" According to the department's website, they were contacted January 17 at about 5:20 p.m. when Bearden didn't return home. Garden police said a formal search in the community will occur Saturday. ""Officials are asking that private volunteers and volunteer organizations refrain from searching this immediate area so not to interfere with the search or contaminate the area,"" police said Thursday. ""Garden Ridge Police Department, Comal County Sheriff's Office, Comal County Constables, Schertz Police Department, Texas Rangers and Bracken First Responders will be supporting with the rescue.""

"Syrian forces in Damascus loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have fired at least four Scud missiles inside Syria, presumably at rebel groups, a U.S. official said Wednesday. U.S. military satellites picked up and confirmed the infrared signature of the four short-range Scud missiles, which were launched from the Damascus area into northern Syria, according to an official who declined to be named, citing the sensitivity of the matter. The missiles did not land on the Turkish side of the border but ""came close,"" the official said. And as Syrian forces dabble with longer-range weapons with increased lethality, authorities say NATO is also preparing to send a Patriot missile defense system to neighboring Turkey after it made the request at a meeting in Brussels last week. Within days, the Obama administration is expected to issue orders determining the number of Patriot missile batteries and personnel to be sent, according to a Pentagon spokesman. Earlier this month, a U.S. official said the Syrian government was ""ratcheting things up,"" noting that Syrian forces had already fired some 20 rockets with the relatively long range of 60 miles. Analysts say the Assad government maintains up to 400 of the short- and medium-range Russian-developed Scud missiles, while State Department officials point to so-called barrel bombs -- incendiary explosives with flammable material similar to napalm -- that are now apparently being deployed by the Syrian government. NATO issued a statement Wednesday saying that the alliance had ""detected the launch of a number of unguided, short-range ballistic missiles inside Syria this week,"" and that the ""trajectory and distance traveled indicate they were Scud-type missiles."" The move represents an escalation in the 20-month civil war, which has threatened to destabilize the broader region and draw neighboring countries and militant groups into the conflict. ""As the regime becomes more and more desperate, we see it resorting to increased lethality and more vicious weapons moving forward,"" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. ""And we have in recent days seen missiles deployed."" Amid the growing concern about missiles, Syria's newly formed opposition coalition won recognition from international supporters on Wednesday in Morocco. The Friends of Syria group, representing more than 100 countries and organizations, agreed Wednesday to recognize the National Coalition of the Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. The designation immediately broadens international recognition for the coalition and should pave the way for additional support for the rebel cause, said Brookings Institution analyst Salman Shaikh, who attended the session in Marrakech, Morocco. ""What this recognition does, I think, is give the coalition more confidence in its workings,"" Shaikh said. Previously, several Arab and European states, including France and the United Kingdom, had recognized the group. The Friends of Syria recognition, however, did little to soothe opposition leaders stung by U.S. President Barack Obama's decision Tuesday to list one rebel group as a terrorist organization. Opposition leader Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib urged the United States to rescind its decision to list the al-Nusra organization as a terrorist group and impose sanctions on its leaders, saying the coalition rejects radical violence. Al-Nusra is not part of the coalition but has fought against Syria's government and, consequently, has support among Syrians sympathetic to the rebellion, Shaikh said. Read more: Aleppo Today TV becomes vital news source amid Syria's chaos . The United States sent Deputy Secretary of State William Burns to the Friends of Syria meeting, which came a day after Obama said his administration had decided to grant recognition to the coalition. ""We've made a decision that the Syrian opposition coalition is now inclusive enough, is reflective and representative enough of the Syrian population that we consider them the legitimate representative of the Syrian people in opposition to the Assad regime,"" Obama told ABC's Barbara Walters. At the Morocco meeting, Burns told Syrian rebel leaders that their newfound recognition is freighted with the weight of international expectations. Read more: As fighting subsides, Aleppo residents find little left . ""This leadership comes with real responsibilities,"" he said, according to a transcript posted on the State Department's website. On top of previous commitments, Burns said the United States will provide $14 million for emergency medical care and for supplies to help Syrians live through the coming winter, including plastic insulation, boots and nutritional supplies. Saudi Arabia also pledged $100 million in aid, Shaikh said. Read more: An afternoon with a Syrian bombmaker . Obama's statement Tuesday came as a surprise to Russia, said Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He said an agreement he had worked out in Geneva, Switzerland, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out a path for a negotiated transfer of power, but he said the new coalition's goals call for it to ""overturn the regime, dismantle government institutions and refuse dialogue with the Syrian government."" ""We inquired with our American partners as to how that conforms with the logic of the Geneva communique, and they told us that the most important thing is to unite the opposition, and its platform can, quote, 'be corrected,'"" Lavrov said. As the diplomatic talks were going on in Morocco, violence continued in Syria. State TV showed images of an explosion outside the Interior Ministry in Damascus, saying it was one of three bombings that killed five people and injured 23. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the explosion killed eight Syrian soldiers and wounded 40. The state-run SANA news agency said two bombs exploded behind the Justice Palace, injuring one person. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said 113 people had died in fighting Wednesday, including 15 children. The group said government warplanes struck at targets in the suburbs of Damascus as rebels and government forces clashed nationwide.","Syrian forces have fired at least four Scud missiles inside Syria, U.S. officials say .

"MOSCOW, Russia (Reuters) -- Russian explorers have dived deep below the North Pole in a submersible and planted their national flag on the seabed to stake a symbolic claim to the energy riches of the Arctic. The Akademik Fedorov research ship carried about 100 scientists to the region. A mechanical arm on Thursday dropped a specially made, rust-proof titanium flag painted with the Russian tricolor on to the Arctic seabed at a depth of 4,261 meters (13,980 feet). ""It was so lovely down there,"" Itar-Tass news agency quoted expedition leader Artur Chilingarov as saying as he emerged from one of two submersibles that made the dive. ""If a hundred or a thousand years from now someone goes down to where we were, they will see the Russian flag,"" said Chilingarov, 67, a top pro-Kremlin member of parliament. Russia wants to extend right up to the North Pole the territory it controls in the Arctic, believed to hold vast reserves of untapped oil and natural gas, which is expected to become more accessible as climate change melts the ice. President Vladimir Putin congratulated the expedition by telephone on ""the outstanding scientific project,"" local agencies reported. Boris Gryzlov, who heads the State Duma lower chamber of parliament and the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, hailed the expedition as ""a new stage of developing Russia's polar riches."" ""This is fully in line with Russia's strategic interests,"" local media quoted him as saying. ""I am proud our country remains the leader in conquering the Arctic. I am proud United Russia members took part in this unprecedented mission."" Major Russian channels aired a message from the Russian crew manning the International Space Station who said ""this achievement must inspire the younger generation"". Earlier on Thursday Canada mocked Russia's ambitions and said the expedition was nothing more than a show. ""This isn't the 15th century. You can't go around the world and just plant flags and say 'We're claiming this territory',"" Canadian Foreign Minister Peter MacKay told CTV television. Under international law, the five states with territory inside the Arctic Circle -- Canada, Norway, Russia, the United States and Denmark via its control of Greenland -- have a 320-kilometer (200-mile) economic zone around the north of their coastline. Russia is claiming a larger slice extending as far as the pole because, Moscow says, the Arctic seabed and Siberia are linked by one continental shelf. ""Then Russia can give foundation to its claim to more than a million square kilometers of the oceanic shelf,"" said a news reader for Russia's state news channel Vesti-24, which made the expedition its top news story. Russian media have said the move could raise tension with the United States in a battle for Arctic gas. ""I'm not sure of whether they've put a metal flag, a rubber flag or a bed sheet on the ocean floor. Either way, it doesn't have any legal standing or effect on this claim,"" State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey told reporters. A Tass reporter on board the mission support ship said crew members cheered as Chilingarov climbed out of the submersible and was handed a pair of slippers. ""This may sound grandiloquent but for me this is like placing a flag on the moon, this is really a massive scientific achievement,"" Sergei Balyasnikov, spokesman for Russia's Arctic and Antarctic Institute, told Reuters. Russia says the mission is intended to show that the Lomonosov ridge, a 1,800-kilometer underwater mountain range that extends under the Arctic to near the pole, is a geological extension of Russian territory. It denied it was a land grab. ""The aim of this expedition is not to stake Russia's claim but to show that our shelf reaches to the North Pole,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Manila, where he is attending a regional security conference. The Mir-1 submersible reached the seabed at 1208 Moscow time (0808 GMT) and returned to the surface exactly six hours later. A second Russian submersible, manned by Swedish businessman Frederik Paulsen and Australian adventurer Mike McDowell, reached the seabed 27 minutes later. It reached a depth of 4,302 meters. Soviet and U.S. nuclear submarines have often traveled under the polar icecap, but until Thursday none had reached the seabed under the pole. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- Manchester City's English Premier League title came at a staggering cost, with the Abu Dhabi-owned team splashing huge amounts on transfer fees and wages for high-profiles stars like Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and David Silva. Whether City's expensively assembled squad is worth the astronomical wage bill is debatable, but it would seem City's fans are getting their money's worth after the English champions topped a ""Value League"" released this week. The league, compiled by the ING Direct bank, ranks England's top-flight clubs based on how much fans pay for their season tickets compared to how the team performed during the 2011-12 season and how many goals they scored. And it is City who emerged on top, with the team's home fans enjoying 18 wins, one draw and 55 goals in the club's 19 Premier League games at the Etihad Stadium. Who are European football's ""Most Valuable Players?"" Just like on the pitch, City beat off competition from neighbors Manchester United, who placed fourth. Second on the list were Wigan Athletic, who, despite flirting with relegation for the majority of the season, provided their fans with more entertainment than their more illustrious rivals. At the other end of the scale, Queens Park Rangers have been ranked as the worst value for money for their fans. Despite escaping relegation to earn a second successive season in the Premier League, QPR -- owned by Lotus F1 chief Tony Fernandes -- offered their fans the worst performances based on the cost of a season ticket at Loftus Road. Brand power: Football's most valuable clubs unveiled . Just above Rangers are Liverpool, who last week dispensed with the services of legendary manager Kenny Dalglish after fans endured the club's worst Premier League campaign. Supporters gathered in the famous Kop stand at Liverpool's Anfield stadium saw just six home wins for the Reds during 2011-12, with the five-time European champions finding the net on only 24 occasions. A survey was also conducted to find out what percentage of season ticket-holders in England's top division would be renewing for the 2012-13 campaign. Out of a sample of over 2,000 fans, 9% said they would not be renewing their season tickets regardless of price, with 7% set to renew if the price does not increase and 13% yet to decide. ING Direct CEO Richard Doe is not surprised a section of fans are questioning the need to attend games given the current economic climate. ""Football fans face the same economic difficulties as everyone else and supporting their team can be a costly outgoing,"" Doe said in a press release. ""So it's not surprising that many fans are questioning the value for money they're getting from their club."" Despite facing financial difficulties, Doe said many fans will ultimately renew their season tickets due to the emotional connection they feel to their team. ""Come the excitement that the start of the new season brings, it will also be interesting to see how many fans put the love of their club ahead of other financial priorities."" Of the 20 clubs in the Premier League, 12 have frozen or lowered season ticket prices ahead of the new season while five have announced price hikes. The Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) is a voluntary organization representing fans across Britain. The FSF told CNN that, while ticket prices differ throughout the league, the issue of admission prices is still a pressing one for football fans. ""Prices vary from club to club so it's unfair to put every one in the same category,"" said an FSF spokesman. ""But it is fair to say ticket pricing is a major concern for fans."" The FSF went on to explain how ticket pricing and the possible introduction of safe standing areas into football grounds were two issues which fans would like to see addressed. Football stadia in England's top division are required to be all-seater after the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, when 96 fans lost their lives during an FA Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. ""Alongside fans telling the FSF that they'd like to see the introduction of safe standing areas, and individual complaints relating to policing or stewarding, (ticket pricing) is one of the most frequent topics the FSF receives calls and emails about,"" the FSF said.","Manchester City fans received the best value for money during the 2011-12 season .

"Frank Schleck is to leave the Tour de France after the International Cycling Union (ICU) revealed he had tested positive for a banned substance. Schleck, from Luxembourg, finished third in the iconic race last year but his Radioshack team have said he will take no further part in the Tour after he tested positive for the diuretic Xipamide. The 32-year-old is currently 12th place in this year's race, nine minutes and 45 seconds behind the leader, Team Sky's Bradley Wiggins. A statement from the sport's governing body said a sample collected from Schleck on July 14 had failed their screening process. ""Earlier today the UCI advised the Luxembourger rider Frank Schleck of an adverse analytical finding (presence of the diuretic Xipamide...) in the urine sample collected from him at an in competition test,"" the UCI said. ""The UCI Anti-Doping Rules do not provide for a provisional suspension given the nature of the substance, which is a specified substance. ""However, the UCI is confident that his team will take the necessary steps to enable the Tour de France to continue in serenity and to ensure that their rider has the opportunity to properly prepare his defense in particular within the legal time line, which allows four days for him to have his B sample analyzed."" According to the World Anti Doping Agency, an offense involving a specified substance allows a tribunal more flexibility, and recognizes it is possible for such a substance to enter an athlete's body inadvertently. ""There is a greater likelihood that these substances could be susceptible to a credible non-doping explanation,"" their website explains. Soon after the ICU's statement, Radioshack responded with one of their own stating Schleck would take no further part in this year's Tour. It read: ""After being informed by the UCI about the presence of Xipamide in the urine sample of Frank Schleck on July 14, the team has decided to immediately withdraw Frank Schleck from the Tour de France. ""Even though an abnormal A sample does not require these measures, Mr Schleck and the team believe this is the right thing to do, to ensure the Tour de France can go on in calm and that Frank Schleck can prepare his defense in accordance with the legal timing to do so. ""On the subject of Xipamide the team can declare the following: it is not a product that is present in any of the medicine that the team uses and the reason for the presence of Xipamide in the urine sample of Mr Schleck is unclear to the team. ""Therefore, the team is not able to explain the adverse findings at this point. However, the team is fully determined to collaborate with the anti-doping agencies in order to resolve the matter.""

"(CNN) -- A team of scientists has agreed that a giant asteroid killed off dinosaurs and a majority of other species on Earth more than 65 million years ago. The researchers analyzed evidence and agreed that it supports a single-impact theory first proposed 30 years ago on the cause of the mass extinction. Since 1980, scientists have gathered an overwhelming amount of evidence that shows a single asteroid about 6 miles in diameter, traveling at around 43,000 mph, slammed into the Gulf of Mexico, said Richard Norris, a paleoceanographer at the University of California San Diego. The impact caused a crater 24 miles deep and 125 miles wide, according to Norris, who was part of the research team. The crater was discovered in 1991 in Chicxulub, Mexico, on the Yucatan Peninsula, said scientists who called it the ""smoking gun"" that backed up the asteroid theory. Norris compared the asteroid's impact with a blast from 100 million megatons of TNT. ""It's basically more powerful than all the atomic weapons on the planet going off all at once,"" he said. The researchers wanted to settle disputes about what killed off the dinosaurs. Some theories have argued that it would have taken many meteorites to cause such a cataclysmic event. Another rival theory suggested that the mass extinction was a result of a massive volcanic eruption in India that took place around the same time as the impact. However, evidence now shows that one monster impact caused the ecological catastrophe, Norris said. Data at the crater's location showed rock with concentrations of iridium and platinum, which are characteristic of the chemical fingerprints of the asteroid, Norris said. Norris speculates it took about 15 million years before the planet and surviving species started recovering from the impact that also destroyed 70 percent of other species. ""It's believed that the impact actually blew down the forests over most of North America from the pressure wave associated with the explosion,"" Norris said. ""Then there was this fireball that came after that that fried a lot of vegetation and basically cleaned off the landscape over most of North America."" Scientists say the impact also caused a huge earthquake. It ""jiggled loose a lot of sediment on the eastern seaboard,"" Norris said. The conclusion was published in the journal Science on Friday.","Scientists say a single asteroid about 6 miles in diameter slammed into the Gulf of Mexico .

"(CNN) -- So much for destiny. The Royals seemingly had karma on their side and were ready to put a Hollywood ending on a memorable season, but the baseball gods had a different plan. For they had created a pitcher who had a performance that surely isn't that of a mortal. Led by Most Valuable Player Madison Bumgarner, the San Francisco Giants won an exciting and intriguing World Series Game 7 by a 3-2 score. In the second World Series matchup of wildcard teams, it wasn't to be for the young Royals, who even got the tying run to third base in the ninth inning. But the Giants had Bumgarner, and no one was going to score against him. Madison the Magnificent . Early on, the Royals had to think things were going perfectly. They knocked out Giants starter Tim Hudson in a hurry, and it looked like San Fran skipper Bruce Bochy was going to have to make repeated calls to his bullpen. They were keeping the game close, even though they trailed by a run. Sure, the Giants had Bumgarner, their ace, available, but he just threw a complete game three days ago. Even if he came in, it seemed impossible he'd throw more than a couple innings. He threw an inconceivable five. You know the last time that's been done before Wednesday. Probably never. ""I wasn't thinking about finishing the game or how many innings I was going to go or pitch count,"" Bumgarner said. ""I was just wanting to get outs."" Bumgarner finished the World Series with two wins, one incredible save and an ERA of 0.43. Asked if he was fatigued after such a magnificent performance, the 25-year-old star admitted, yeah, he was. ""I can't lie to you any more; I'm a little tired now,"" he said with a chuckle. 90 feet from extra innings . With Bumgarner locked in and two out in the ninth, San Francisco fans couldn't be blamed if they were celebrating. But K.C. still had a little life. After all, these are the Royals who appeared doomed in the American League Wild Card game, only to rally for a win. Kansas City's Alex Gordon was the last hope, and he laced a liner to left center. Hearts in Kansas City sank as it appeared Gregor Blanco might catch it. Their hearts raced as the ball fell and skipped by the outfielder and rolled to the wall. Gordon headed toward third as Juan Perez fumbled the ball. Could it be? Would Gordon turn for home and score the most improbable of runs? San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said he was just thinking: ""Let's get the ball in because Gordon can run."" Perez was able to pick up the ball and get it back to the infield in time to keep Gordon from scoring. Then Bumgarner closed out the game, enticing Salvador Perez to pop out. ""To end up losing the ball game by 90 feet, it's tough,"" Royals manager Ned Yost said. ""The hard part about this is, you work all year (beginning in February) to climb to the top of the mountain and then -- boom -- you fall back, and you gotta start right back at the bottom next year."" Just wait til next year . Royals fans have waited three decades (it seems even longer) but despite a tough loss, they were still proud of their lads. ""The @Royals may have lost, but this team and that city is all winner. Thanks for a GREAT post season. Congrats Giants and GO @KCChiefs!!!!"" ""Modern Family"" actor Eric Stonestreet tweeted. ""Never been prouder of @Royals on a great season and an absolutely unforgettable, drama-filled playoff run. Well done, fellas,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest wrote. ""I love my @Royals!!! Thanks for the best Series I've seen in 29 yrs! Congrats San Francisco Giants,"" added comedian Rob Riggle. Fans at Kauffman Stadium stayed after the end and even broke into a loud ""Let's go Royals"" chant. Affeldt bridges the gap . Years from now, when Jeremy Affeldt shows off his World Series rings, people will ask him about watching Madison Bumgarner pitch. They'll have long forgotten, if they ever knew, that Affeldt had a lower ERA in the 2014 postseason then even the Giants star. No one scored on Affeldt. No one. In Game 7, before Bumgarner stole the headlines, Affeldt blanked the Royals for 2 1/3 innings. It earned him the win (Originally the win was given to Bumgarner but the decision was changed later). Affeldt has now pitched in 22 consecutive playoff games without surrendering a run. Only the legendary Mariano Rivera has done better. ""Affeldt, he is incredible,"" Bochy said. ""He's played a critical role in these three championships."" Party time . San Francisco fans are used to watching their team win the World Series on the road.

"Recently I wrote about the many problems I've encountered while trying to become a runner -- from asthma to shin splints to plantar fasciitis. Some of you supported the idea that overcoming obstacles is the right choice, while others suggested I listen to my body and give up the idea of running altogether. As I've started to lead a healthier, more active life, I've tried to find as much information as possible related to health and fitness. If you've ever tried to research any particular topic related to health, you've probably found what I did -- information overload! To add to the confusion, much of the information provides conflicting advice. This seems to be true whether you're looking for nutritional recommendations, training programs, or even deciding what type of exercise equipment is best. The varied opinions, even from professional trainers and athletes, can leave your head spinning. Why being part of a team matters . Given all this conflicting advice, people may fail to even start an exercise program because they're afraid of doing something wrong. ""How can I become healthy if I don't really know what 'healthy' means?"" I know I've asked myself this very question many times over the years . For example, a simple task such as finding the right running shoes can seem overwhelming. We encounter terms like pronation, stability and foot-strike. Do we want more support or is a minimalist shoe best? Training programs pose their own particular brand of ""in your face"" information overload. Are you training for strength or endurance? Are you best working out at a gym or at home, with free weights or weight machines? How do you tell the difference between boot camp, CrossFit or Zumba? Does it make a difference if you are training for a 5K or a marathon? The questions you can ask yourself and the answers are endless. Nutrition provides another source of even more conflicting advice. We're all familiar with the celebrity trainers, each taking unique approaches to help you properly fuel your body. Should you eat a meal every four hours or just make sure to eat several small meals throughout the day? Are all carbohydrates bad and all proteins good? How do you fuel your training? Do you exercise best on minimal calories first thing in the morning? Do you prefer a later workout and a small meal a couple of hours before you hit the trails? To say these different nutritional ideas are confusing is an understatement. Get fit and others will follow . I never really considered before I joined the Fit Nation team that my needs might be unique. Each of us responds differently, so each of us has to find the right combination of nutrients and meal times to make our workouts count. I've found that I need a small meal with as little processed sugar as possible about one to two hours before I work out. Too long before and I run out of energy; too close and I'm too full to work at my full potential. In many cases, the best plan is to minimize the information overload and focus on the simplest pathway to your goals. For example, the simplest nutritional advice I received was to concentrate on unprocessed, whole foods at the edge of the grocery store and keep my meals colorful with a variety of fruits and vegetables. It's straightforward, easy to remember, and most importantly, easy to understand. We also need the right equipment to make that training count. Most of us have a local running store (or cycling shop or gym) where the experts can offer their guidance. With their help, you can try a few options and find out what works best for you. How to make your workout seem shorter . If you do have a particular health-related concern, your first stop should be your physician's office. Your doctor can help you cut through the conflicting advice and decide what plan may work best for you. My physician knows about my training program and has helped advise me how to prevent certain problems that could derail my progress. The jungle of information should not stop you from pursuing a healthier life. I've found that there is no one-size-fits-all prescription for success and health. Variation and experimentation are the keys to discovering what options work best for you. I decided it's my responsibility to learn as much as possible so that I can give myself every opportunity to succeed, but I won't let conflicting information slow me down. Are the choices I make and the program I follow right for everyone? Maybe not, but they are right for me right now. As long as I keep learning, listening to my body and making informed decisions, I hope to keep training and continue on my journey to lead a healthier life.

"Marching, dancing and poster-waving environmentalists chanting ""Hey, Obama. We don't want no climate drama,"" packed several blocks on and around Washington's National Mall on Sunday, hoping to spur President Barack Obama to take strong measures against climate change. Allison Spitz, 16, brandished a sign reading ""Oil and Water Don't Mix"" as she attended her first political demonstration. ""Someday, I hope to have my own kids, and I want them to live in a world that's environmentally safe and natural,"" Spitz said, explaining why she, her mother and her boyfriend had traveled more than 500 miles from Plymouth, Michigan. ""This is the kind of thing worth leaving home to come out and take a stand for,"" she said. Throngs at the ""Forward on Climate"" rally spent several hours marching from the Washington Monument to the White House, then back to the Mall. Those who arrived early, and those who didn't let the cold dissuade them from returning to the Mall, heard speakers call on the president to reject the Keystone XL pipeline and to tell the Environmental Protection Agency to set carbon standards for power plants. During Obama's State of the Union speech on Tuesday, the president urged Congress to do more to combat climate change. ""We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it's too late,"" the president said. ""I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will."" Some activists have been urging Obama to bypass the often messy legislative process and instead focus on executive orders and regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. ""Congress is a place where good ideas go to die,"" Melinda Pierce, legislative director for the environmental group the Sierra Club, said last month. ""There is a tremendous amount that his administration can do without Congress. He has the authority. He doesn't have to wait for Congress."" Long-term climate change fueled by a buildup of atmospheric carbon emissions is a controversial notion politically, but it's one accepted as fact by most scientists. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, which traps heat, have gone up sharply in recent decades, while global average temperatures are up about 1.5 degrees F since records started being kept in the late 19th century, according to NASA. The Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 pact aimed at reining in carbon emissions, aimed to limit that increase to 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) by 2100 --  but a November report by the World Bank warned that trends point more toward an increase twice that big by the end of the century. The 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline project -- which would extend current oil pipeline networks from Alberta, Canada's bitumen-filled ground, all the way across the United States to the Gulf of Mexico -- exposed partisan and regional divisions within Congress during Obama's first term. Bitumen, otherwise known as tar sand, is oil-soaked dirt that needs to be cooked to extract the oil. A Congressional Research Service report released in June said oil produced from bitumen emits 14% to 20% more greenhouse gases -- the gases that can cause atmospheric hearting -- than the average transportation fuels sold or distributed in the United States. The Alberta government website says the province is the first jurisdiction to set mandatory reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions. However, it says while average emissions per oil barrel are declining, since the demand for oil production has increased, overall emissions have increased as well. At Sunday's rally, Maura Cowley of the Energy Action Coalition verbalized a common theme. ""Keystone XL is a dirty and dangerous pipeline. It's literally going to cut our country in half, carrying a very dangerous fuel, and it will cause runaway climate change,"" Cowley said. ""Young people across the country are the same generation that elected Barack Obama twice now, and we really want to see him reject the Keystone XL pipeline."" The Obama administration rejected the initial proposal from the Canadian energy company TransCanada, saying it needed more time to gauge the potential environmental impact of the project. While that decision pleased environmentalists, pipeline supporters argued that the postponement cost Americans jobs and a degree of energy independence. The White House has probably already decided against ever approving Keystone XL, despite the pipeline's many supporters, said Patrick Michaels, the director of the Center for the Study of Science at the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute. ""The political calculus is obvious. If they come out against it, they are going to pay a very big price,"" Michaels said Sunday. ""It's very popular around the country: the notion that you are going to be pumping more oil through this country, that there will be some jobs that will be established to put the pipeline in. There will be some jobs for maintenance, and, you know, if you want to talk about the internationalization, if you will, of oil supply, Canada is our biggest supplier and they're friendly.  What's not to like?"" Environmentalists say there's plenty not to like. Of greatest concern initially, the Keystone XL pipeline was designed to run through Nebraska's Sandhills, which lie above the Ogallala Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation for millions of people. Now, even though refined plans show an alternate route, environmentalists worry that if the expected 500,000 to 700,000 barrels of crude oil flow through the pipeline each day, leaks could contaminate the water and soil. Michaels said those fears are unfounded, and ""climate change is becoming the last refuge of regulatory scoundrels."" ""It reminds me of the TransCanada pipeline that was supposed to cause all these problems and wreak all this havoc. It never did.  All it did was supply oil,"" Michaels said. He posited that U.S. emissions from the energy sector are at their lowest level since 1992, despite -- not thanks to -- government intervention. ""That didn't happen because of subsidizing solar energy and windmills. There's just not a lot, not enough electricity coming from those minuscule rays. It happened because of natural gas, hydrofracturizing and horizontal drilling, which has increased the supply dramatically,"" he said. The Department of Energy has taken credit for laying the groundwork for the current natural gas boom, citing research and development dating back to the 1970s that led to today's hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, techniques of extracting gas from shale. The U.S. Energy Information Administration says increased use of natural gas has come at the expense of coal, which tends to emit significantly more carbon dioxide than natural gas. ""It wasn't because people wanted to save the planet. It's because they wanted to make money. Gee, that's how to make people efficient. Don't fetter the economy and you'll find out that people want to produce, either want to produce things efficiently or produce efficient things. They are advantaged in the marketplace. Get the government out of it and you'll get a greener planet,"" Michaels said. But the crowds that braved temperatures in the low 30s and winds exceeding 20 mph to make their point heard in Washington couldn't disagree more. ""Climate change is established science. And it's time we get our act together and find a better way is renewable energy,"" said Lissa Spitz, Allison's mother. ""If they put a minuscule amount of the money into research and development for renewable energy that they spend on fossil fuels, we'd be there now. You know, it's not because it can't be done. It's because of the political and financial powers that be that have a vested interest in keeping the system that we have now. And it's not working."" The Sierra Club, the anti-climate change consortium 350.org, and the civil rights organization the Hip Hop Caucus put together the rally.","The National Mall in Washington was packed with anti-climate change protesters Sunday .

"On his way home from a trip to Colombia, marriage equality advocate Hunter Carter discovered another way to fight for his rights. Carter and husband Cesar Zapata stepped up to the American Airlines ticket counter in Medellin, Colombia, expecting to undergo a preflight security screening together, just like heterosexual married couples. That didn't happen, even though the United States Supreme Court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act in late June, allowing for some federal recognition of same-sex marriage rights. The Transportation Security Administration's rules had not been updated when the couple flew home from Colombia on January 18, a story first reported in the Washington Blade. With the exception of husbands and wives, and parents and their children younger than 13, airlines flying into the United States from certain countries have to screen travelers individually under TSA rules. That appears to be changing. The TSA is updating its language, an agency spokesman confirmed Thursday. Because they were not a heterosexual married couple, American Airlines agents refused to screen Zapata and Carter together before issuing their boarding passes, Carter said. One rudely ordered Zapata back in line, Carter said. ""We knew this had happened to another couple but didn't believe it could happen to us,"" said Carter, a partner at the New York law office of Arent Fox. American Airlines confirmed the two men were screened separately.  Employees were following TSA security rules, said Bob Witeck, president of Witeck Communications, who consults with American on LGBT issues. Within hours of the incident, the couple took to Twitter and Facebook to report the incident. Carter also contacted the White House LGBT liaison and two members of Congress to ask the TSA to update its airline screening questions. ""TSA is working to make clear any confusion in language included in the Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program document,"" wrote a TSA spokesman, via e-mail. ""TSA policy is for every attempt to be made to accommodate all families traveling together."" The agency declined to discuss any more specifics of its security procedures. ""I'm thrilled how quickly people decided this is wrong,"" said Carter. ""It's a sign of the times that American executives at the corporate level wanted to stamp this out fast."" The change appears to be immediate at American Airlines, Carter said, citing an e-mail he received from an airline lawyer: ""TSA has communicated to our Corporate Security folks that they are working on a technical change to its directive, and that, pending that change, we can immediately begin screening same-sex spouses together. We are working on communicating this change in procedures to our stations ASAP."" American is happy to implement the TSA change, said Witeck. ""For two decades, American Airlines has been a leader in LGBT equality, and now with DOMA's repeal, outdated rules that treat married couples differently can come tumbling down,"" said Witeck. ""A seemingly small but crucial equality milestone for all travelers."" It won't be too long before Carter and Zapata will test the change. They have a second home in Colombia, and they're flying back in March for a wedding. ""I expect us to be treated like every other legally married couple,"" said Carter. ""When they ask, 'Why are you together?' I will say, 'We're legally married.' We expect them to give us our boarding passes, and we'll move on.""","Gay couple didn't expect to be separated for airline security screening .
Heterosexual married couples can answer the preflight questions together .
TSA says it is changing its guidance for airlines flying into the United States ."
"Well over a year after Congress voluntarily imposed a ban on pork barrel spending, the number and cost of earmarks have dropped dramatically, a report said Tuesday -- but the snouts are not out of the trough altogether. The 2012 database of pork-barrel projects compiled by the nongovernmental group Citizens Against Government Waste, known as the Congressional Pig Book, says Congress has some way to go to cut out wasteful spending. It finds that the number of earmarks has decreased by 98.3% from 9,129 in fiscal year 2010, when the Pig Book was last produced, to just 152 in fiscal year 2012. The cost has also plummeted by 80%, from $16.5 billion in 2010 to $3.3 billion in 2012, the lowest sum in a decade, it says. Numerous pet projects still found their way into appropriations bills despite the supposed moratorium on earmarks, the Pig Book's authors say -- and despite Congress certifying each appropriations bill as earmark-free. Citizens Against Government Waste acknowledges that its criteria for what constitutes an earmark differ from those of Congress. The report comes amid a political furor over allegations of lavish spending on conferences and rewards programs by the General Services Administration, a government agency. Earmarks, which are federal funds that members of Congress direct to specific projects back home, were common practice for years but have become a target for budget-conscious deficit hawks. Those detected in 2012 ""involve larger amounts of money and include fewer details than in prior years,"" the Pig Book says, with a side effect of the moratorium being that pork barrel spending is much harder to spot. ""The supposed lack of earmarks resulted in a completely opaque process. Since earmarks were deemed to be non-existent, there were no names of legislators, no information on where and why the money will be spent, and no list or chart of earmarks in the appropriations bills or reports,"" the report says. ""While the lower number and cost of earmarks are a vast improvement over prior years, transparency and accountability have regressed immeasurably."" The Pig Book highlights several earmarks slipped into the defense appropriations bill, including $255 million to upgrade the M1 Abrams tank, a project opposed by the Pentagon; $239 million for cancer research that is already funded elsewhere; and $50 million for National Guard Counterdrug Program state plans. It also flags $9.5 million for high energy cost grants, $3.4 million for national fish hatchery operations and $3 million for aquatic plant control as among the ""most blatant examples of pork."" But as part of an overall downward trend, the appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human Services saw a huge decline in earmarks, from 1,789 in 2010 to three in 2012. One of those that made it through was $5 million for abstinence education. Only one earmark showed up in the 2012 financial services appropriations bill, the report says, down from 270 in the 2010 financial year. That was $38.5 million for a drug trafficking program at the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Four earmarks were spotted in the State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill, the report says, including $114.8 million for the United Nations Democracy Fund, despite the Obama administration never requesting funding for it. Another is a $5.9 million award for the East-West Center in Hawaii, which its authors flag as a home-state project of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii. Earmarks have typically accounted for less than 1% of the budget. But critics say the funding awards do not undergo the same scrutiny as other spending and tend to reflect the influence individual lawmakers wield in Congress, rather than merit. While some lawmakers have called for legislation to be passed to turn the moratorium into a permanent ban on earmarks, others oppose that step. The report names Inouye; Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada; Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi; and Senate appropriator Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, as among those critical of the continuation of the moratorium. Citizens Against Government Waste suggests that until a ban is imposed, ""taxpayers will be justified in their belief that members of Congress are being creative and deceptive in skirting the moratorium and continuing to obtain earmarks.""","The number of earmarks has fallen dramatically for 2012, the Pig Book report says .
Some earmarks are still finding their way into spending bills despite a voluntary ban .
A tank upgrade program and fish hatchery projects are examples highlighted by the report .
The supposed ban on pork barrel spending has damaged transparency, its authors say ."
"Gabi Rose wore maternity clothes for more than 12 years. Her weight, which bounced up and down around her four pregnancies, wasn't just an aesthetic concern. She had frequent asthma attacks, broke an ankle several times, developed rosacea and noticed that her hair had stopped growing. ""I didn't realize it was affecting my entire family,"" Rose said. Once Rose got serious about losing weight for good, she, her husband, David, and daughter Rachel lost a combined 300 pounds together. A big factor in the trio's transformation was changing how they ate: choosing healthier foods and cooking at home. ""The weight loss in my opinion is the easy part,"" Rose said. ""It's the maintenance that's hard, and that's difficult and takes time and education and understanding."" A family health crisis . Rose had many complications with her pregnancies. She was hospitalized for four weeks because of preeclampsia with her first son, Josh. Her third child, Noah, almost died as an infant. Rose suffered badly with asthma and weighed close to 300 pounds when she was pregnant with her youngest child, Sarah. Her older daughter Rachel, now 14, suffered weight problems, too. Rachel remembers going to Target with her mother and wanting to try on clothes in the kids' section. But because of her large size as a third-grader, she had to shop in the adult section. It was hard for Rachel, knowing children were in the other part of the store; she was surrounded by ""all these old women."" ""Rachel looks at old pictures of herself and she says, 'Why did you let me get so big?' "" Rose said. ""It probably is my fault. I was kind of lost myself."" Rose tried commercial weight-loss programs, but nothing worked. She became serious about getting healthy after an asthma attack in 2005, a year after Sarah's birth. Rose was driving her children home from a friend's house when she felt a heaviness in her chest. She reached for her inhaler, but it wasn't in her purse. She panicked and pulled over. ""The only thing I could think of is: 'I'm going to die here on the street,' "" she said. ""I called my husband and I told him where I was, because I didn't think I'd be alive when he got there."" Her brush with death made her decide once and for all: The weight had to go. Changing bad habits . In those days, Rose didn't cook much at all. Frozen pizza, chicken nuggets in a bag, mac and cheese in a box, a pre-made ""family-size portion"" of chicken lasagna for herself and her husband -- these were typical meals. When the children were little, Rose kept a hefty supply of bags of chips, she said. ""All the neighborhood kids used to come over all the time because I had so much junk food,"" she said. But in 2006, Rose dedicated herself to understanding healthy food choices. Now Rose avoids anything that comes in a bag or box. The family cooks together, making main courses such as chicken wings from scratch and sides such as mashed potatoes mixed with cauliflower. Every meal has a salad. Rose's husband has become ""a wizard with stir fry,"" she said. And Rachel, who used to buy two ice cream snacks at school at lunch, now brings her lunch from home and makes strawberry-banana protein smoothies. Getting up and moving . The family has also been spending less time sitting on the couch. Rachel and Noah have been playing tennis for years. They've motivated the rest of the family to play tennis, too, Rose said. The family also rides bikes around the neighborhood and has gone on outdoor adventures such as white-water rafting and an obstacle course. They have joined a family gym, so that everyone is working out at the same time, and have run 5K races together over the past two years. David Rose credits his wife as leading by example in the diet and fitness changes that have transformed the household. He lost 80 pounds, which he has kept off for four years, and now weighs about 188 pounds. ""I remember the first day that she took me over to the gym and put me on an elliptical machine,"" he said. ""That was the beginning of a process."" Ups and downs . It hasn't always been easy. On Valentine's Day 2008, David went to buy his wife a fondue maker and gourmet chocolate from a local chocolatier. She had loved the Melting Pot fondue restaurant; he thought with this present, ""I was hitting a grand slam home run."" He was wrong. ""I just looked at him and said, 'You've got to be kidding me,' "" Gabi Rose said. ""I was just beside myself. He's just not understanding the efforts that I'm putting into my weight loss."" Her fury didn't abate when her husband tossed the chocolate in the garbage. She didn't speak to him for a month. (""I knew she was going to bring up [the fondue],"" he said later). In retrospect, Rose sees that until that point her weight-loss efforts had been inconsistent. But her husband apologized, telling his wife that he hadn't understood where she was coming from -- that she was serious about getting healthy, long term, and about making everyone in the family feel better about themselves. ""He was afraid that I was going to become a different person I guess, or not as fun as I used to be,"" she said. ""But we found fun in other ways, without eating."" Inspiring others . Today, Rose weighs 145 pounds, and has become an expert on losing weight. She has traveled extensively, speaking about how to make healthy changes, and was the host and co-producer of a reality show in South Florida called ""The Get Fit Club."" In 2009, she teamed up with Dr. Elisabeth Cohn-Gelwasser -- whose medical practice Rose has been coordinating since 1994 -- to offer a medical weight-loss program that targets nutrition and fitness and also incorporates counseling in behavior modification, and medication when necessary. From a size 26, Rose has slimmed down to a size 2. Rachel has also made significant progress; she lost 50 pounds between 2009 and 2011, and her father said she has been ""an inspiration to other children."" Now in high school, Rachel knows a lot of girls who complain about their appearances. ""I honestly can't relate to them, because I love the way that I am right now,"" she said. As for the embattled fondue maker, it's still in the family's kitchen, David said. It's a reminder of an era of overeating that's melted away.

"(CNN)Protests -- some disruptive, but none violent -- marked Martin Luther King Jr. Day across the country. The demonstrations took on a new vigor this year, after the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner -- two black men who were killed by white police officers. More than 60 protesters partially closed the San Mateo Bridge in the San Francisco Bay area, the California Highway Patrol reported. ""It was peaceful, but they were blocking the bridge and were arrested,"" said Officer Damian Cistaro. The disruption snarled traffic for miles. Demonstrators also targeted transportation in nearby Oakland, shutting down the Bay Area Rapid Transit Coliseum station as part of a ""Reclaim King's Legacy"" march. Seventh-grader Kai Jones said he thinks it's important to protest because ""young men my age and older are getting killed, and it's not fair,"" he told CNN affiliate KGO. The day started very early with a 5 a.m. protest outside the home of Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, which was just fine with her. ""I woke up this morning knowing it's great to be an American, that we are a city that allows people to peacefully assemble and to protest,"" she said. In Seattle, the situation was dicier as demonstrators danced on roadways, challenging police to corral them. One police officer suffered a serious leg injury, responding to protesters, authorities said. Organizers said civil disobedience is a way to bring about change. ""People are putting their lives on the line to make a statement that black lives do matter,"" Monica Avery told affiliate KOMO. ""And there is a national call ... to start moving our lives and putting our bodies on the line to move the movement against police brutality."" Nineteen demonstrators were taken into custody, KOMO reported. In Boston, hundreds protested police brutality and called for social justice. The 4-mile walk to Boston Common touted the familiar messages of recent protests -- ""Black lives matter,"" ""Jail killer cops,"" ""Remember Ferguson,"" and the thought-provoking ""Who will be our next King?"" In Minnesota, demonstrators descended on the state Capitol in St. Paul. Along the way, they shut down traffic briefly on Interstate 94. U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison praised the fight for racial equality. ""They're putting their lives on the line,"" he told affiliate WCCO. ""And sometimes they disrupt traffic; they make a lot of noise. They're trying to get our attention."" But it wasn't all protests and demonstrations. In Los Angeles, tens of thousands watched the 30th annual Kingdom Day Parade, with 3,000 taking part. This year's theme: ""Love & Respect: Let It Begin With Me."" The parade was a celebration of King's life, complete with marching bands and some advice from the grand marshal on how all people can get along. ""If you want to be successful with anything, take a peaceful approach that we are all together,"" Herb Wesson, a City Council member and grand marshal, told affiliate KTLA. ""What's good for one group of people is good for all groups."" The observances come as The New Yorker unveiled a poignant magazine cover, combining the historical with current. Called ""The Dream of Reconciliation,"" the cover shows Martin Luther King Jr. marching arm-in-arm with Brown, Garner, Trayvon Martin and NYPD Officer Wenjian Liu. Liu and fellow Officer Rafael Ramos were gunned down in their patrol car last month. ""It struck me that King's vision was both the empowerment of African-Americans, the insistence on civil rights, but also the reconciliation of people who seemed so hard to reconcile,"" artist Barry Blitt said. ""In New York and elsewhere, the tension between the police and the policed is at the center of things,"" he said. ""It is hard to believe things would have got as bad as they are if he was still around today.""","Many marches mark King Day across the country .

"Excellent! Alex Winter, who played Bill S. Preston Esq. in 1989's ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" and 1991's ""Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey,"" said plans for the pair's third movie are coming along -- and Keanu Reeves, who played Ted ""Theodore"" Logan, is also on board. ""(Bill and Ted) will be 40-something, and it's all about Bill and Ted grown up, or not grown up,"" Winter told Yahoo. ""It's really sweet and really f***ing funny."" The films star Winter and Reeves as two slacker friends who find out that they're key to a utopian future -- but first they have to pass a history test. In the first film, thanks to the intercession of Rufus (George Carlin), the two travel through history and gather notables such as Napoleon, Genghis Khan and Abraham Lincoln, allowing them to breeze through. In the second film, the two face off against Death -- though, instead of playing him in a ""Seventh Seal""-type chess match, the two choose to challenge Death to games of Battleship and Twister. The first film was an unlikely success, Winter recalled in April. ""I hate to say it, but we kind of gave up on the movie,"" Winter told the UK's Guardian. ""It was much closer to the chopping block than anyone knows."" Winter didn't say who would take the place of Carlin, who died in 2008, but told Yahoo there will be ""many versions of ourselves in this movie."" The bigger challenge, he added, was that the earlier films have such a large fan base and expectations are high. ""The thing we had going against us is that word got out,"" he explains. ""That was kind of a bummer. It just takes a long time to put a movie together. Now we're having to build this thing in public, which is fine. I just feel bad (the fans) have to get dragged through this long, boring, protracted process.""

"(CNN) -- Elizabeth Edwards, the estranged wife of 2004 vice presidential candidate and former North Carolina senator John Edwards, died Tuesday after a lengthy battle with cancer. She was 61. She died at the family home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, according to a statement released by the family. ""Today we have lost the comfort of Elizabeth's presence but she remains the heart of this family,"" the statement said. ""We love her and will never know anyone more inspiring or full of life."" Edwards was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after her husband lost his bid for vice president in November 2004. John Edwards, a one-term Democratic senator, was Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry's running mate. It was later revealed that she knew before the election she might have cancer, but shielded her husband from the news during the campaign. She immediately underwent treatment, and the cancer was believed to be in remission. In March 2007 -- at the start her husband's 2008 presidential campaign -- Edwards learned that the cancer had returned and spread. Dr. Lisa Carey, the oncologist treating Edwards, categorized the cancer as metastatic stage four cancer, largely confined to the bones. The cancer was diagnosed treatable but not curable, Edwards said. Despite the diagnosis, Edwards said she was ready to go forward with her husband's bid for the White House. ""Either you push forward with the things that you were doing yesterday or you start dying,"" she said. ""If I had given up everything that my life was about ... I'd let cancer win before it needed to."" ""Maybe eventually it will win,"" she said. ""But I'd let it win before I needed to."" John Edwards, unable to compete with the attention focused on then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, withdrew from the presidential race in January 2008. Several months later, he admitted that tabloid claims about an extramarital affair with former campaign videographer Rielle Hunter were true. Eventually, he also admitted to fathering a child with Hunter -- an allegation he initially vociferously denied even after conceding the affair. John Edwards said the affair happened in 2006 while his wife's cancer was in remission. He claimed he informed his wife at the time and asked for her forgiveness. The couple was criticized by some activists for not revealing the affair prior to his presidential bid, as the news could have damaged Democratic chances if it became publicly known during a general election campaign in which John Edwards was the party's standard bearer. ""This was our private matter, and I frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was I did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well,"" Elizabeth Edwards said. The affair appeared to end any future political ambitions the former senator may have had. It also led to the couple's separation. Elizabeth Edwards was born Mary Elizabeth Anania on July 3, 1949, in Jacksonville, Florida. Her father was a Navy pilot, and in her early years, she attended school in Japan. She attended the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, and met her future husband while studying at UNC's law school. They spent their first date dancing at a local Holiday Inn, and it ended with John kissing Elizabeth on the forehead. ""It was just really sweet,"" she said of the kiss. ""I wasn't used to men being sweet."" The couple was married July 30, 1977, the Saturday after they took their state bar exams. They had four children: Wade, Cate, Emma Claire, and Jack. Wade Edwards was killed in a car accident in 1996. Mrs. Edwards worked as a clerk for U.S. District Judge Calvitt Clarke Jr. in Norfolk, Virginia, and was a bankruptcy lawyer in Raleigh. In 2006, after her initial cancer diagnosis, she wrote ""Saving Graces: Finding Solace and Strength from Friends and Strangers,"" which chronicled the aftermath of her son's death and her battle with the disease. When her cancer returned in 2007, the couple held a news conference to publicize the information and declare their intention to continue with John Edwards' campaign. ""You can go cower in the corner and hide or you can go out there and stand up for what you believe in,"" the former senator said. ""We have no intentions of cowering in the corner."" In an interview with the Detroit Free Press after her husband admitted to his affair, Elizabeth Edwards said the incident helped her focus on resuming her role as an advocate for the poor and for health care reform. She also said it pushed her to refocus on her role as a mother. She also said she did not want her husband's tarnished public image to overshadow his role as an advocate for the poor -- particularly in the eyes of her children. ""I have to prepare for the possibility if I die before they are grown"" to make them ""able to function without an involved, engaged and admiring parent,"" she said. ""So I need to create the picture for them that I want them to have."" In a September interview on ""The Nate Berkus Show,"" Edwards was asked what she sees when she looks at her estranged husband, John Edwards. ""I see the father of my children, and that's very important to me,"" she said. ""Particularly since I have a terminal disease, this is the person who at some point will take over the primary parenting, and it's important to me that he heals, if he needs too."" Asked about forgiveness, Elizabeth Edwards said that's a difficult topic for her. ""It's really hard to use a word like forgiveness but we found a new of interacting with one another that is healthy -- and I think for the kids -- and really easy for us, which is great,"" she said. She said living with stage four cancer ""is like dancing with a partner who keeps changing."" ""Fortunately with the research, it looks like there may be a new drug for me down the line,"" she said. ""My job is to stay alive until they find a cure. I don't think there's any way to live with this diagnosis than to have that kind of optimism."" On Monday, the Edwards family released a statement saying that further cancer treatment would be unproductive. In a message posted on her Facebook page, Elizabeth Edwards addressed her family and friends: . ""The days of our lives, for all of us, are numbered. We know that. And, yes, there are certainly times when we aren't able to muster as much strength and patience as we would like. It's called being human,"" she wrote. ""But I have found that in the simple act of living with hope, and in the daily effort to have a positive impact in the world, the days I do have are made all the more meaningful and precious. And for that I am grateful. It isn't possible to put into words the love and gratitude I feel to everyone who has and continues to support and inspire me every day. To you I simply say: you know.""

"(CNN) -- As tensions in Ferguson, Missouri, have bubbled, one official after another has taken the lead, grappling to figure out how to stop it from coming to a boil. First, it was the police chief who took charge and stumbled. Then, the governor entered the picture and brought on a Ferguson son to head security. The feds have also stepped in, with Attorney General Eric Holder stopping by Wednesday to check up on their investigation. Here's a look at the players who have shaped the city's response to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, at the hands of a white police officer. WHO: . Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson . What he did: . From the start the chief said his department -- which handed off the local investigation to St. Louis County -- would release information as it received it. It would be a slow process, he warned. How it played out: . From the beginning the chief was slammed for just how slow that information came out. The big one was the identity of the officer. It took six days before the name -- Darren Wilson -- was revealed. Cops said it was because he received death threats. Critics denounced the delay as a PR stumble that coincided with another one -- the release of a video that police said showed Brown robbing a store minutes before he was shot. Critics lambasted the disclosure of the video as character assassination. The chief said he had to do it. Jackson was also criticized for his department's response to the protests in the days immediately after Brown's death. As the demonstrations grew more heated, police used on the crowd tear gas, pepper bullets and what looked like stun grenades. Some police rolled into action sitting on an armored personnel carrier. How it was received: . ""You're in trouble when your SWAT team is on the front line of dealing with a civil disturbance,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Russell HonorÃ©, a CNN analyst. Jackson said police had to protect themselves and that some of the protesters were throwing fire bombs. WHO: . Ferguson Mayor James Knowles . What he did: . The young mayor has tried to tell people unfamiliar with the town he has lived in his whole life that it's not the crucible of racial tensions it appears to be to those outside the city limits. ""I've lived here 35 years. There's always been a strong African-American presence,"" he told CNN. ""We've never seen this kind of violence, never seen this kind of frustration or tension between the races."" How it played out: . The mayor has kept largely out of the spotlight, letting other officials take care of news conferences and major public appearances. Instead he's gone on one-on-one interviews and given updates on how his town reacted. How it was received: . His low profile may be helping him to avert criticism over actions taken since Brown's shooting, but Knowles has been in the line of fire with other officials over the disproportionate number of white officers on the police force of his majority African-American town. He has defended the imbalance, telling the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that every time a position frees up for a new officer that the city rushes out to find an African-American to fill it. Ferguson is less successful at getting such recruits than neighboring departments, which are better at recruiting and offer higher salaries, he said. He has also come under criticism for a racial imbalance in the city council, where five of six members are white. Knowles, first elected in 2011, told the Post-Dispatch that he ran for election unopposed. WHO: . Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon . What he did: . First he stayed out things, and when he did go, he visited the neighboring town of Florissant, not Ferguson. Then he made the decision to bring in the highway patrol. How it played out: . Poorly. The violent protests were getting more violent and police were drawing more criticism for its tactics. And the media, local and national, was asking: Where's the governor? The Washington Post wrote: ""A week ago, Jay Nixon was a Democratic governor with a promising political future. Today, he's a guy with a rocky recent past."" Once Nixon stepped into the fray, he didn't go to the shooting scene and was accused of avoiding ground zero. How it was received: . Attendees interjected at a meeting Nixon held at a local church to announce a controversial curfew. They demanded he charge Wilson with murder. They accused law enforcement of triggering nightly violence with militaristic tactics. WHO: . Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson . What he did: . When it seemed like the situation in Ferguson was doomed to grow out of control, the governor wrested oversight of the security force and gave it to Johnson, a Ferguson native. And at first it seemed the captain had turned the tide. He walked with protesters, turned a news conference into a community forum, seemed like a good guy who was a bridge between community and government. On Sunday, Johnson appeared at a church rally in support of the Johnson family. With a solemn and pained expression, he said he was sorry to the parents, and he explained that he, too, was the father of a black son who wears saggy pants and has tattoos. ""My baby,"" he called his boy. How it played out: . Johnson has been open with the public as he has been trying to calm the uneasiness in the air. And even as tension still permeates the town, residents feel a little better because they know the captain will be out there. He's one of them, and they can ask him their questions. How it was received: . Well -- except for minor hiccups. Johnson was welcomed with open arms last week. But security forces under his command have lobbed tear gas and stun grenades at rowdy protesters, who toss rocks and Molotov cocktails at them. That may have soured some of the initial sentiments. CNN's Jake Tapper echoed the frustrations of many. ""Absolutely there have been looters, absolutely over the last nine days there has been violence, but there is nothing going on in this street right now that merits this scene out of Bagram (Afghanistan). Nothing."" WHO: . Attorney Malik Shabazz . What he did: . He's the national president and founder of Black Lawyers for Justice. He has been trying to help the community stay away from rowdy elements, who he says are not from Ferguson. He told CNN on Tuesday that he came to Ferguson as a ""man and a father figure."" He felt confident that he and others could have a good influence on young men. How it played out: . Shabazz insists ""provocateurs"" from outside the community have caused the problems. He accused them of being planted in the crowd to make demonstrators look bad and turn public opinion in favor of the police. ""We can't allow this movement to be destroyed,"" he said. On Monday, when rocks and tear gas canisters flew, he was out with a bullhorn urging people to keep calm. How it was received: . Despite Shabazz' efforts on behalf of Ferguson protesters, he has a very controversial past. The former leader of the New Black Panther Party is a black supremacist, with a history of anti-Semitic remarks, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group that guards the rights of minorities and monitors hate groups. Shabazz has often railed against white people, calling them inherently evil, the SPLC said. WHO: . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder . What he did: . The first black U.S. attorney general will visit Ferguson on Wednesday. He's checking up on the Justice Department's civil rights investigation into the shooting. He said he'll also meet with community leaders. The FBI has about 40 investigators in Ferguson, Holder wrote in a letter to the people of Ferguson. He says: ""We hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm"" to the city. How it's playing out: . Holder wrote that the investigation had already made good progress, but indicated it was not going to wrap up anytime soon. How it's being received: . It's hard to tell yet. In civil rights issues, he is considered President Barack Obama's ambassador. Some people get nervous when they see him coming. Under Holder, the Justice Department has intensified its scrutiny of police departments, launching 20 investigations of police practices and alleged discriminatory enforcement patterns in the past five years. That's more than twice the number of such probes in the previous five years. WHO: . St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch . What he did: . He's been the county's top prosecutor since 1991 and has been easily re-elected five times. This year, he actually had a challenger in his primary, which he handily won just a few days before Brown was killed. After Gov. Nixon replaced the St. Louis County Police with the Missouri State Highway Patrol for security last week, McCulloch said the initial law enforcement response to the shooting was excessive. McCulloch told CNN affiliate KMOV that the governor had ""no legal authority"" to make such a move. How it's playing out: . McCulloch steps before a grand jury Wednesday with the assignment of making his case against Wilson. He has eyewitness accounts of Brown's shooting as well as Wilson's own account of what happened. Beyond that, much of the evidence is not yet ready, and a CNN legal analyst said it could take a long time for crime labs to process it. How it's being received: . Critics have said he could be biased in favor of the man he is tasked with prosecuting. He's the son of a cop who was killed at work 50 years ago. His mother was a clerk for the St. Louis Police Department, and three relatives were also with SLMPD. He would have been an officer too, but cancer took one of his legs. Missouri State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed and 26,000 other people have signed a petition calling for McCulloch to be removed from the case -- and a special prosecutor assigned. Governor Nixon has refused to do so.

"Country star Trace Adkins has decided not to sing at SeaWorld to avoid controversy over how the Orlando, Florida, theme park treats its orcas. Adkins joins a long list of musical acts who have canceled shows that were scheduled as part of SeaWorld's ""Bands, Blues & BBQ"" in February and March. ""Trace prefers that the focus of his performances be on music, not on controversy,"" Adkins' representative said in a statement e-mailed to CNN on Thursday. ""Therefore, he has decided not to proceed with this show in the midst of this debate."" The entertainers' exodus from SeaWorld's calendar begin soon after CNN broadcast the documentary ""Blackfish"" in October. The film tells the story of the killing of a SeaWorld trainer by an orca in 2010. It raises questions about the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity. Online petitions and social media postings targeted the acts who had signed on to play at the park. Only Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery remain from the original list of acts on the event calendar. Their representatives have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for comment. A promoter could put together a whale of a concert series with the acts that have canceled SeaWorld shows, including Trisha Yearwood, Willie Nelson, Cheap Trick, Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Martina McBride and 38 Special. SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck confirmed Adkins' cancellation, which CNN was initially alerted to through Twitter postings Thursday. ""While we're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld, we respect the artists' decisions,"" Gollattscheck said in an e-mailed statement nearly identical to what was sent to CNN when others canceled last month.   ""We expect that other artists will be targeted in this campaign."" Adkins' show was never officially announced, but it later appeared on his own online schedule for March 2, 2014. The park's six-week concert scheduled disappeared from SeaWorld's website last month. It now simply promises ""incredible concerts with top artists in classic rock and country music."" SeaWorld is working to book replacement acts, Gollattscheck said. ""We'll announce the full lineup of bands when all artists have been confirmed."" The Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies was the first to cancel, reacting to a petition posted on Change.org. ""This is a complicated issue, and we don't claim to understand all of it, but we don't feel comfortable proceeding with the gig at this time,"" the band said on its Facebook page. ""I don't agree with the way they treat their animals,"" Willie Nelson said on December 6 when he canceled. ""It wasn't that hard a deal for me."" Sisters Nancy and Ann Wilson of Heart did not elaborate last month when they announced their decision to cancel at SeaWorld, although they acknowledged it was ""due to the controversial documentary film."" ""We're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld,"" Gollattscheck said. SeaWorld said it would like the musical artists to learn for themselves about SeaWorld. ""The bands and artists have a standing invitation to visit any of our parks to see firsthand or to speak to any of our animal experts to learn for themselves how we care for animals and how little truth there is to the allegations made by animal extremist groups opposed to the zoological display of marine mammals,"" Gollattscheck said. SeaWorld says the documentary ignores the park's conservation efforts and research. ""More than 11 million people a year visit SeaWorld parks and most will see a killer whale presentation during their visit,"" Gollattscheck said.  ""Over the course of our 50-year history hundreds of millions of people have experienced killer whales in our parks.  There is tremendous appeal in that kind of inspirational and educational experience and we anticipate that killer whale display will continue for generations to come.""","Adkins joins a long list of musical acts who have canceled SeaWorld shows recently .

"(CNN) -- You have to think about picking up girls the exact same way you think about picking up a box. You just do it. Seriously. After working with thousands of men all around the world, I have found that the common issue holding men back with women is that ""thing"" on top of their shoulders. It thinks, analyzes and makes excuses, so rejection is self-inflicted before women even get a chance to do it. Here are six secrets men need to know about women to help them stop that ""thing"" in their head from destroying their dating life: . Women have baggage, too, especially the attractive ones. You think insecurity and low confidence are only for those who are fat, bald and ugly? Not so, my friend. Just because a woman is hot does not mean that her life is perfect. Remember, beauty does not equal perfection. It's simply one thing about a woman that she literally wears on her sleeve. Women prefer personality to looks. As a woman, I know this to be very true. But I also know it's a tough one for men to swallow. Obviously, in the first five seconds, she judges a man based on his looks. But after that, something interesting happens: A man's face shifts according to how he makes a woman feel. A hot man can become hideous, and an average-looking man can become the sexiest guy in the room. What women are really attracted to has nothing to do with appearance. It has to do with the character a man projects. A man who is calm, cool, collected, comfortable and confident will trump an Abercrombie model every time. Women DO NOT like bad boys. Not sure who started this rumor, but they must be shot immediately. Women do not sit around with their girlfriends and say ""Oh, Marni, I can't wait to meet a lazy, unreliable jerk who treats me poorly and feeds on my insecurities."" Women like nice guys, not wimps, pushovers or pleasers; nice guys with a backbone and strong sense of self. There's no ""right"" line, but there's a right way to say it. If I had four men approach me using the same, tried-and-tested pickup line, do you think I would be attracted to all four of them? Maybe, but highly unlikely. I can tell you that if the right man with the right character came up to me and said ""banana, banana, banana,"" I would giggle like a little schoolgirl and instantly feel attraction for him. There is never a bad time to approach a woman. Women want to be approached, as long as it's by the right person. If you see a girl you like, stop, breathe and think to yourself, ""She's adorable. I want to talk to her and see if I like her."" Notice the ""I want"" and the spirit of figuring out what you like.  Until you get to know this girl, it's about you, not her. Women want you to respect them, not admire them. So stop putting women you know nothing about on pedestals. Yes, they're hot, yes other men may want them, but that does not mean that all self-respect gets thrown out the door. Respect yourself first, and women will follow. So use these lessons as the first step to eliminating the anxiety that ""thing"" produces. The second part is getting out there and practicing. Sitting on your couch watching ""Law & Order"" is not going to bring you results with women.","Here are six secrets men need to know about women so they don't destroy their dating life .

"A jury recommended Friday that Joshua Komisarjevsky receive the death penalty for his role in a deadly Connecticut home invasion in 2007. The decision was made after more than five days of deliberations following a six-week penalty phase of a case whose grisly details may have helped slow efforts to abolish capital punishment in Connecticut. ""We believe justice has been served,"" said William Petit, the sole survivor of a brutal attack that left his wife and two daughters dead in their Cheshire, Connecticut home. ""We think society will be a little safer with he and his co-defendant locked up and facing the death penalty."" Flanked by family members, Petit thanked jurors for Friday's decision, acknowledging the public support he says he's received throughout the duration of the trial. Still, Petit said, there's never complete closure when you lose your family. Judge Jon Blue is expected weigh the jury's recommendation in sentencing Komisarjevsky, who was convicted in October on six capital felony charges. The 12-member jury voted for death by lethal injection on each of the six counts. Sentencing is scheduled for 10 a.m. January 27. Blue also instructed jurors not to comment on Friday's decision to avoid jeopardizing the verdict. ""You have done something many people find impossible,"" said Blue, acknowledging that jurors had been ""exposed to profoundly disturbing evidence."" Komisarjevsky, 31, showed little emotion as authorities led him out of the courtroom in handcuffs. His accomplice, Steven Hayes, the first defendant to stand trial in the case, was sentenced to death after a jury convicted him on 16 of 17 charges last year. Prosecutors argued that Hayes and Komisarjevsky went into the Petit home, beat and tied up William Petit, raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. Before assaulting and killing Jennifer Hawke-Petit, Hayes forced her to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000 from an account after finding evidence that the account held between $20,000 and $30,000, authorities said. The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation, while William Petit managed to escape from the basement, where he had been held. Before the home invasion and murders, Hayes had been charged with third-degree burglary in 2003 and sentenced to five years in prison. He was released only three years later to a halfway house, where he met the man who would later become his accomplice. Komisarjevsky's attorneys have petitioned for leniency, arguing that their client had no prior history of violence, was abused as a child and had been committed to a mental hospital for depression. ""Its just wrong (for jurors) to give their authorization ... to kill this man,"" attorney Jeremiah Donovan said. ""Appropriate punishment in this case is to confine Joshua in a state prison."" He called Komisarjevsky's family dysfunctional, pointing to his uncle, Chris, who told reporters that he supported the jurors' decision and that Joshua had to take responsibility for his actions. ""The crime was monstrous and beyond anyone's comprehension,"" he said, offering his apologies to the Petit family.","Komisarjevsky's attorneys say that killing their client is wrong .

"OK, we can admit it. Even though Kate Upton spent six days in Antarctica posing in minimal clothing in below-freezing temperatures -- which she says led to hypothermia and frostbite -- we're jealous. Why? Um, because we don't look like that in a bikini. Upton is the first model to be picked to do back-to-back covers for Sports Illustrated's swimsuit edition since Tyra Banks appeared for the second time in 1997. And you only have to look at the photos to figure out why. Fitness trainer David Kirsch started working with Upton in August to prepare for the December photo shoot. We reached out to ask him about her exercise regimen, the biggest mistakes he sees clients make at the gym and why a strong mind is just as important as a strong body. CNN: What was Upton's training schedule like? David Kirsch: The idea was to step up the intensity and duration of the workouts, making it a strict cardio and sculpting boot camp that entailed body weights and resistance bands, sprinting and calisthenics, shadow- and kickboxing. At the beginning, we worked out seven days a week, twice a day. Then we brought it down to five to six days a week for one hour a day. CNN: Was there a specific area she needed or wanted to tone? Kirsch: Kate has beautiful, feminine curves, and I didn't want her to lose a crazy amount of weight. The goal was to lengthen and tone her thighs and inner thighs, and keep her butt perky. It wasn't about dramatically changing her body; I didn't want to do that. Just tighten, tone, lengthen. CNN: What was the most difficult thing for Upton? What was the easiest? Kirsch: Most difficult for her was the sprinting -- getting up to a sprint was challenging. And the easiest was the boxing and kickboxing, mostly because she loved kicking my ass! CNN: Do you have a training motto or No. 1 rule for your clients? Kirsch: My training philosophy is sound mind, sound body. That is my No. 1 rule. That and follow my ABCs: no alcohol, bread or processed carbs. CNN: What is the biggest obstacle people face in getting to the gym? Kirsch: I think the biggest obstacle for most people is that they don't think they have the time to work out. But if you follow my advice and do my express workouts, or break your exercise into 10- to 15-minute increments throughout the day, you'll find that you have plenty of time to exercise in small doses. CNN: What is the most common mistake you see people make while working out? Kirsch: They don't subscribe to my mind-body philosophy of training; they're not doing the correct exercise for their body type, or they're distracted, socializing, using PDAs instead of focusing and visualizing. CNN: Give our readers the ultimate piece of advice -- something you've learned over the years that they might not know. Kirsch: The mind is more powerful than any muscle in our body. With our mind focused, we can will ourselves to unbelievable greatness. We don't imagine we'll be posing on the cover of Sports Illustrated anytime soon, but maybe with Kirsch's tips we won't be as afraid to shed our cover-ups come summer.

"(CNN)  -- A move is afoot to make the oil-rich province of Basra a more potent political and economic power in Iraq. Along with provincial elections in Iraq, residents in Basra may also be voting to become an autonomous region. Lawmakers have started a drive that would give the Shiite-dominated province the status of a federal region -- the same legal power as the multi-province autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq. The move would usher in self-government and could boost oil income in Basra, although the organizers of the drive have indicated they would be more cooperative with the central Iraqi government than Kurdistan is on oil matters. Iraqi affairs scholar Reidar Visser suggests the autonomy initiative -- which he notes is the first of its kind outside the Kurdish areas -- ""shows that the inhabitants in Basra may care more for their local patriotism than for their religious identity as Shiites."" ""Basra holds perhaps 60 percent of Iraq's oil reserves, whereas most of the other Shiite areas of Iraq have only insignificant amounts of oil,"" said Visser, a research fellow at the Norwegian Institute for International Affairs. Wail Abd al-Latif -- a Basra member of parliament and a former Basra provincial governor -- is leading the drive and has hinted that he wants the region to receive its own share of the oil income generated there, Visser said. The effort is also backed by a powerful local movement called the Fadhila Party. Iraq is a collection of ethnicities and religions, and there has been a tug of war between a central government attempting to tie the country together and various groups pursuing their own interests. The Kurds have had their three-province autonomous region in the north for years, and the central government and the Kurds have had their disagreements: The Kurds have used their autonomy to pursue oil contracts that aren't recognized by Iraq's central government. But al-Latif said his Basra initiative is not seeking ""to interfere with the central government when it comes to the administration of the oil sector and the signing of contracts."" ""The federalists in Basra appear to be more prepared to work with Baghdad than the Kurds have been so far,"" Visser said. A monthlong petition drive started Monday for a Basra region referendum -- which would be held if at least 10 percent of the more than 1.4 million registered voters in the province sign up, said the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq, or UNAMI, which is helping Iraq with its electoral process. Residents have until January 14 to go to 34 locations in the province to submit their signatures. A referendum could be held two to three months after Iraqi election officials certify that the required number of signatures was gathered, a UNAMI source told CNN. The voting age in Iraq is 18, but anybody born in 1991 will be allowed to register and submit signatures after January 1. Under the country's constitution, any of Iraq's 18 provinces may form federal regions, either alone or as a group. Regions have the right to create their own constitutions, have separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, and have security forces under their control. ""In the case of a contradiction between regional and national legislation in respect to a matter outside the exclusive authorities of the federal government, the regional power shall have the right to amend the application of the national legislation within that region,"" the constitution says. ""What rights the regions will have with regard to the oil sector remains controversial,"" said Visser, also the editor of historiae.org -- where he posts scholarly papers about Iraq, including one on Monday about the Basra region. Another idea for an autonomous region has emerged from the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, one of the parties in the ruling United Iraq Alliance. It is looking at a nine-province federal region in the south. Basra is the only Iraqi province that borders a body of water -- the Shatt al Arab waterway near the Persian Gulf. The province also borders Kuwait and Iran. Cities in the province include Basra city, Umm Qasr and Zubayr.","Petition drive under way for a Basra region referendum .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich might be licking their wounds after defeat in the European Champions League final, but the German club can find comfort in victory of a different kind: by beating Chelsea in football's financial league table. Despite Saturday's crushing penalty shootout loss to the English side in their own backyard at the the Allianz Arena, the Bavarians have been ranked as the second most valuable brand in football. According to a new report by independent consultancy Brand Finance, which has compiled a list of the 50 biggest brands in the sport, the four-time European champions have been valued at $786 million. Chelsea, by comparison, made fifth place with a value of $398 million. But English giants Manchester United lead the way, as in 2011, with a brand estimated to be worth $853 million. ""Manchester United have got a global reach,"" Brand Finance's head of sports brands Dave Chattaway told CNN. Click here to see football's top 10 brands . ""United have got quite a professional setup, with people who have worked for Pepsi, Disney, all different kinds of marketing industries. They have brought their expertise into the sports industry."" But Bayern are the year's big winners. Despite the defeat by Chelsea and having been beaten to the German league and cup by Borussia Dortmund, the club's brand value grew by 59% over the last 12 months. ""If you look at Bayern Munich, they are a domestic powerhouse,"" said Chattaway. ""They have got really strong links with strong German brands. ""Bayern have long-term deals, they have been with Adidas for over 10 years. They generate the highest commercial revenue and they are able to negotiate the highest possible deals based on their dominance of the German market."" Munich mourns as Bayern blow big chance . Behind United and Bayern are the Spanish ""El Clasico"" rivals of Real Madrid, third with a value of $600 million, and Barcelona, with a brand worth $580 million. Spanish champions Real and 2011 European champions Barca have seen similar decreases in the value of their brands, 7% and 8% respectively, which Chattaway puts down to the country's current economic plight. ""They have both had relatively successful years on the pitch,"" he said. ""The eurozone crisis has really impacted the capital in Spain and Italy. It's not necessarily something they are doing wrong commercially, it's a sign of the economy they operate in."" The top 10 is dominated by teams from the English Premier League, with United and Chelsea followed by 2011-12 title winners Manchester City in eighth ($302 million) Torres unsure of Chelsea future . ""Within Europe, the Premier League is still the pinnacle,"" explained Chattaway. ""It still generates the most money because of the broadcast rights. ""It is much more attractive to a foreign audience than the German Bundesliga or the Spanish First Division. The Premier League clubs are benefiting from that."" Italian Cup winners Napoli ($85 million) were the only Serie A club to increase brand value, coming off the back of a relatively successful Champions League campaign, to be 22nd overall. AC Milan ($292 million) placed ninth on the list after winning the title in 2010-11, while this season's champions Juventus ($160 million) fell from 10th in 2011 to 16th this year. Former England captain David Beckham and his Los Angeles Galaxy teammates enjoyed a landmark year in 2011, being crowned Major League Soccer champions for a third time. Despite their success, and despite boasting one of football's most recognizable and marketable stars, the Galaxy ($46 million) only crept onto the list in 50th position. ""The game in the U.S. is still developing massively,"" said Chattaway. ""The revenues are a fraction of those in Europe. The games are rarely sold out and the grounds themselves have quite a small capacity. ""The commercial deals in the U.S. cannot compete with the European market. The MLS is still largely only shown in the U.S., it hasn't really expanded globally as quickly as we would have expected."" With such a huge gap between the sport's most lucrative brands and those with less commercial appeal, are football clubs making the most of their financial potential? ""I think there is more scope for all the clubs to further maximize value -- clubs have traditionally been slow and unimaginative in monetizing the brand they own,"" Chattaway said. ""There is scope for football clubs to learn from U.S. sports marketing practices. ""The clubs need to better understand the brand asset that they own so that they can ensure they get the right returns on all commercial deals."" The list took into account various revenue streams for clubs, such as ticket sales, merchandising, sponsorship deals and money received from the sale of broadcasting rights. .","Manchester United again named football's most valuable brand .

"Flanked by his family and before Spain's Parliament, Felipe VI was formally proclaimed the new King of Spain Thursday, following the abdication of his father, Juan Carlos. The new King, clad in military uniform, promised to head a changed monarchy ""for new times,"" in an address before the packed parliamentary chamber. ""We have a great country, we are a great nation -- let us trust in it,"" he told the packed parliamentary chamber and the millions watching nationwide. After swearing an oath promising to uphold the constitution, the new monarch expressed his respect for the Parliament and the nation -- as well as his own emotion at becoming monarch. Felipe paid tribute to his father's ""extraordinary"" legacy over nearly four decades, including his leadership as the country returned to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. He also thanked his mother, Queen Sofia, for a lifetime of hard work and devotion to the Spanish people. Felipe spoke of the need for a monarch to unify his country and to work with its political leaders, a message with added significance at a time when many in the country's Catalonia region want a referendum on independence. He also vowed to carry out his duties, remain loyal to his nation and work for the interests of Spain. ""I will honor the pledge and the oath I have just taken,"" he said. The head of state must set an example of honest and transparent behavior, he said, perhaps a reflection of the scandals that have beset the monarchy in recent times. Felipe reflected on the country's recent economic woes, which have fueled high unemployment rates. But he also spoke of the need for its people, at a time of adversity, to ""look ahead to the Spain we are building together as I begin this reign."" This, he said, will mean modernizing to meet the challenges of a globalized world. The proclamation ceremony is a more subdued affair than a coronation, without the pomp of foreign dignitaries and elaborate ceremonies. But crowds cheered loudly as Felipe, his wife, now Queen Letizia, and their two daughters emerged onto the balcony of the royal palace, joined by Juan Carlos and Sofia, to salute the Spanish people. Chants of ""Long live the king"" rang out in Spanish. Felipe's elder daughter, Leonor, 8, becomes Princess of Asturias, first in line to the throne. Retirements of monarchs . Stroke of pen . His father's 39-year reign had come to an end with the stroke of a pen and the stroke of midnight Wednesday. Less than three weeks after he announced his surprise abdication, longtime leader Juan Carlos signed the step into law at the royal palace in Madrid, making his son the new king. In another ceremony held Thursday morning to mark the transfer of power, Juan Carlos took off the red sash signifying his role as head of Spain's military, fastening it around his son's waist. Crowds lined up waving the red and yellow Spanish flags as military bands marched in the streets of Madrid. Juan Carlos has said Felipe, a former Olympic yachtsman, has ""the maturity, the preparation and the sense of responsibility necessary"" to serve as king and ""to lead to a new stage of hope using his experience and the drive of a new generation."" The new King is regarded as being untouched by the accusations of corruption and excess that have plagued the royal family as many Spaniards continue to struggle to find jobs and pull themselves out of financial ruin. At his side will be the new Queen Letizia, who before she married into the royal family worked as a TV presenter. Princess Cristina, the new King's older sister, is embroiled in a tax fraud and money-laundering investigation. She and her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, have denied allegations that they diverted public funds from Urdangarin's foundation for private use. Spaniards have long held Juan Carlos, 76, in high regard for shepherding the country into democracy. But his popularity took a hit in 2012 over a controversial elephant-hunting trip to Africa while the nation was mired in a deep economic crisis. Some Spaniards have called for the monarchy to be abandoned, favoring the establishment of a republic instead. The anti-monarchy movement has been fueled by the scandals that have hit the royal family in recent years. The biggest task for Felipe, 46, will be to make the dealings of the royal palace more transparent. His family has a relatively austere reputation compared with other European monarchies, but there has been increasing resentment in Spain over the cost of the royal family to the public.","New king and his family wave to cheering crowds from balcony of royal palace .

"Facing the largest anti-government protests in his 11 months in power, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro vowed to move forward with the prosecution of a leading opposition figure on charges of terrorism and murder. Four anti-government protesters and one government supporter have died in clashes around the country. The man the government blames for the deaths is Leopoldo Lopez, an opposition leader who turned himself in to authorities on Tuesday. A court hearing to determine whether Lopez will be released or remain behind bars began inside a military prison Wednesday night, his family told CNN en Español. Human rights groups warn about the danger of turning the protests into a persecution of political opponents. The charges against Lopez, who has organized protests demanding better security, an end to shortages and protected freedom of speech, ""smack of a politically motivated attempt to silence dissent in the country,"" Amnesty International said in a statement. Human Rights Watch weighed in, too, warning that Venezuela must avoid ""scapegoating"" political opponents. But the way forward seemed set, with Maduro referring to opposition leaders as fascists and vowing to take a hard line against those responsible for surging violence. In a national television broadcast Wednesday night, Maduro accused the opposition of trying to overthrow his government with a slow-motion coup. ""This fascist group's leader is already prisoner. He will respond,"" Maduro said. ""And I said, 'He will go to prison.' And that is what I did. And I will do that with all the fascists, wherever they are."" Charges against Lopez include murder, terrorism and arson in connection with the protests, according to his party, Popular Will. Lopez denies the accusations, the party said in a statement, which also asked witnesses of the protests to send their own accounts of what happened to be used in his defense. The party has blamed the government for the violence. Court inside military prison . Crowds of supporters, media crews and security forces swarmed Venezuela's justice building as anticipation built over the hearing. But Lopez's legal team said Wednesday afternoon that officials had ordered a last-minute change of venue for security reasons. Juan Carlos Gutierrez, an attorney representing Lopez, told reporters that a court had been set up inside the military prison outside Caracas where the opposition leader is being held. Defense attorneys were on the way to the prison and planned to argue against holding a hearing there, he said. Lopez's supporters accused the government of violating his due process by setting up a court session inside the prison. ""This is unprecedented. Our constitution says that everyone should be judged in liberty,"" his father, also named Leopoldo Lopez, told CNN en Español on Wednesday. Delsa Solorzano, a Venezuelan representative to the Latin American Parliament, said holding a court session inside the military prison raises a major red flag. ""It demonstrates that in Venezuela there is no separation of powers,"" she told CNN affiliate Globovision. Lopez's wife, Lilian Tintori de Lopez, told CNN en Español she was holding out hope that her husband would be set free after the hearing. ""The last thing he said to me was for me to not forget what he is going through,"" she said. ""Not forget that he is arrested for things that he has asked for: the liberation of political prisoners, liberation of students, no more oppression, no more violence."" Obama: Venezuela 'trying to distract from its own failings' Major social and economic problems in Venezuela have fueled the protests. But as the demonstrations gained steam, officials have pointed fingers at other factors, accusing the United States of plotting to destabilize the government. U.S. President Barack Obama fired back during a news conference in Mexico on Wednesday. ""Venezuela, rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against diplomats from the United States, the government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people,"" he told reporters. ""So, along with the Organization of American States, we call on the Venezuelan government to release protesters that it's detained, and engage in real dialogue. All parties have an obligation to work together to restrain violence and restore calm."" On Monday, Venezuela gave three U.S. diplomats 48 hours to leave the country, accusing them of conspiring to bring down the government. At a rally Tuesday, Maduro shouted, ""Yankee, go home"" from the stage, drawing cheers from the crowd. In Wednesday's television broadcast, Maduro accused Colombian paramilitary forces and the United States of fueling the violence, and vowed to stand firm against any attempts to overthrow his government. ""And what is the Venezuelan opposition going to do?"" he said. ""Believe that with the support of John Kerry or Obama, you are going to be able to take political power by violent means?"" This isn't the first time that bitter protests and counterprotests by supporters and opponents of the government have threatened political stability in Venezuela over the past decade. Many of Maduro's claims -- of U.S. intervention, of assassination plots -- were also lobbed by the late President Hugo Chavez. Chavez was briefly ousted in a coup in 2002, but otherwise outlasted the protests and repeatedly won reelection. He ruled for 14 years, until his death last year after a long battle with cancer. Death toll up . The latest victim of the violence died on Wednesday, a day after being shot during an anti-government protest in the state of Carabobo. The death of Genesis Carmona drew attention because the student was also a beauty queen. She was winner of the 2013 Miss Tourism crown in Carabobo, and represented her state at Miss Tourism Venezuela. Her Twitter account shows she actively retweeted messages from opposition leaders and supported Lopez. She even retweeted guidance for a workaround in case the government tried to block access to social media as the protests grew. The last thing Carmona shared on Twitter was a retweet: ""Stay with the one who tells the best stories. One day they will tell yours."" In Wednesday night's national television broadcast, Maduro described bullet wounds sustained by government forces during protests and showed videos that he said depicted opposition protesters throwing stones and setting buses ablaze. ""You think this is a novel? This is the reality that you with your hatred have created,"" he said. ""If you don't like Venezuela, leave."" CNN equipment taken . A CNN crew covering the anti-government demonstrations had its equipment taken away at gunpoint Tuesday -- but the journalists were unharmed. The incident took place in a neighborhood in Caracas where the CNN crew was preparing to film and the National Guard was present. About 20 men on motorbikes rode toward a crowd of anti-government protesters when they noticed the journalists and approached them, brandishing several guns. They demanded that the crew hand over its equipment, including a camera and broadcasting gear. 17-year-old dies during Venezuelan protests .

"The show will go on. Alan Jackson and Kid Rock will kick off SeaWorld's ""Bands, Brew & BBQ"" this weekend, bucking a trend of artists dropping the show to avoid controversy over how the Orlando, Florida, theme park treats its orcas. The concert event runs Saturdays and Sundays February 1 to March 9. The exodus from SeaWorld's calendar began soon after CNN broadcast the documentary ""Blackfish"" in October. The film tells the story of the killing of a SeaWorld trainer by an orca in 2010. It raises questions about the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity. Country star Trace Adkins pulled out this month. Other acts that have canceled include: Trisha Yearwood, Willie Nelson, Cheap Trick, Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Martina McBride and 38 Special. Pat Benatar, Beach Boys cancel . Only Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery remain on the event calendar from the original list. Their representatives have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for comment. Online petitions and social media postings targeted the acts who had signed on to play at the park. ""We're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld,"" SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck has said. ""The bands and artists have a standing invitation to visit any of our parks to see firsthand or to speak to any of our animal experts to learn for themselves how we care for animals and how little truth there is to the allegations made by animal extremist groups opposed to the zoological display of marine mammals."" SeaWorld says the documentary ignores the park's conservation efforts and research. ""More than 11 million people a year visit SeaWorld parks, and most will see a killer whale presentation during their visit,"" said Gollattscheck. ""Over the course of our 50-year history hundreds of millions of people have experienced killer whales in our parks.

"For members of Congress, the Obamacare debate is getting personal. This week, lawmakers can begin their sign-up process for health care, and a CNN survey shows that while most senators and representatives plan to participate in the Obamacare exchanges, a sizable group is walking away from the government-coordinated exchanges and instead getting their healthcare in the private marketplace. The Chart: Who has signed up for Obamacare in Congress . Enrollment for the House and Senate opened Monday and ends in early December, forcing lawmakers to make two big decisions: Will they personally get coverage through an exchange -- either in Washington as part of their workplace or in their home state -- and if they sign on to the exchange as part of their job, will they take the thousands of dollars a year the federal government gives employees to help with premiums? Of the 118 members of Congress who responded to CNN, the clear majority plan to get coverage on the exchange as members of Congress, taking the employer contribution that comes with it. But nearly 20% of those responding indicated they would not go onto the exchanges. Some, like Rep. Allyson Schwartz, D-Pennsylvania, are on Medicare; a few others rely on pension plans from previous jobs. Related: White House tech expert says HealthCare.gov getting better . But many are choosing to stay out of the exchanges, making a politically sensitive decision that removes them from the process Congress created. Most are Republicans who see it as a statement about Obamacare and fiscal responsibility. ""She came to Congress to fight Obamacare, not to enroll in it,"" wrote a spokesman for Rep. Diane Black, R-Tennessee, who is going directly to the private market for her health care. ""He feels the taxpayers shouldn't have to shoulder those personal costs for him,"" explained a spokesman for Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-New Jersey, who is also heading into the private markets. But it is not just Republicans. ""(He) declined the employer health-coverage (on the exchange) as part of his commitment to fiscal responsibility and saving taxpayer money,"" reads a statement the office Rep. Scott Peters, D-California, sent CNN. Peters will get health coverage through his wife's plan. Related: White House officials get earful from Democrats on Obamacare . The politics are tricky. If they stay in the exchange, they could be accused of backing Obamacare and taking federal money for their health care. But if they leave, they could be accused of not participating in the system Congress invented and, as part of the Affordable Care Act, decreed that lawmakers should personally experience. Several swing-state and closely watched senators have found a possible political middle ground by joining an exchange as individuals, not as members of Congress. Under the current system, Congress essentially acts as a small business employer on the Washington exchange.  Thus, all members of Congress who want coverage and federal contribution dollars through their job have to enroll on that one exchange. But five senators are instead signing up as individuals through their home state, going through the exchange system but forgoing the federal dollars that would be attached if they signed up with their job in the D.C. exchange. ""I want to have the exact same experience and go through the same steps as other Alaskans when it comes to signing up for health care,"" wrote Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska. Colorado Senator Michael Bennet is planning on doing the same in his state, as are fellow Democrats Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Republican John Hoeven of North Dakota. No House members responded that they were moving to their state exchange. One rare category of lawmakers consists of those who are signing up as members of Congress, going through the D.C. exchange, but who are nonetheless rejecting or returning the federal dollars that come with it. Related: 'Obamacare girl' said she felt bullied . The office of Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Florida, told CNN, ""The congressman will return the federal contribution money to the U.S. Treasury."" Same for Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyoming. Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nevada, is still deciding exactly where he'll get his health care, but if he goes with a plan as a member of Congress, his office told CNN, he will donate to charity the thousands of dollars in premium help from the government. Still unknown is whether Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, who launched a fiery protest against the federal contributions to congressional health care plans, will take the money. His office told CNN that he does plan on entering the exchange as a member of Congress, but his staff did not respond to our repeated questions about whether he would take the contribution. Members have until December 9 to decide if they want to get employer-backed coverage as part of their jobs.","Members of Congress will select their health care coverage starting this week .

"Rena was playing on her lounge floor, in her mother's lap, when the shot tore through her cheek. She grimaced, cried for her mother and then went silent, as the blood began to flow in her mouth. The bullet came from nowhere, bursting through the frosted-glass window on the family balcony, knocking out one of her teeth, and shattering her family's world. But in Aleppo, their ordeal had just begun because the struggle here is always to find medical help, fast. Her neighbor -- the women looking after Rena can't leave their home unaccompanied by male relatives -- then rushed her to the street, carrying her body. That's when we saw him, the sight of a man carrying a limp girl still striking even amid the daily atrocities of Aleppo. He flagged down a truck and they began to race towards the hospital. We followed, unsure what had happened. After a minute, the neighbor noticed us and clearly decided our car might move through the traffic faster. He stopped the truck he was in, leapt out and ran towards us, Rena bleeding in his arms, and screamed for help. Inside Syria: Bombs, road blocks and ice cream . He threw Rena onto the back seat and told us to race to the hospital, saying, ""Guys, she's choking."" Amid the traffic and blast of our horns, the sound of Rena's struggle to breathe was clear. A sucking sound, coupled with a gargle. The blood was flowing down her cheeks. Her neighbor screamed out of the window for cars to pass. After a minute that seemed to creep by, the car arrived at the hospital. Dar Al'Shifa sees trauma every hour in many forms. But a child shot in the face still causes doctors to jolt. They raced her into the back emergency room and began to work on her face. The bullet had entered her mouth cleanly but had torn up the other side of her mouth. Soon it became clear they thought she would live. She was breathing more easily. The bandages made the wounds seem less severe. But one problem remained. Dar Al'Shifa is in rebel territory where medical supplies are exhausted and hard to replenish. The decisions doctors take daily defy belief. In Rena's case, she could not get the surgery on her face she clearly needed there, so the doctors dared to think the unthinkable, and sent her across the front lines to the better equipped government hospital. She was piled into a truck and then vanished. The women who were caring for her when the bullet struck -- her grandmother and mother -- were still at home trying to understand what had happened. On the stairs up to the apartment was Rena's blood. Inside the apartment was her tooth. In the window was the small hole that the bullet had made. More than 100,000 refugees flee Syria in one month . A military-trained safety adviser working with the CNN crew assessed the hole made by the bullet and the trajectory when it hit Rena. It was clear to him that it must have been fired from one of the high apartment blocks opposite Rena's home. These buildings are inside rebel territory, but snipers -- particularly those working for the infamous pro-government militia known as the Shabeeha -- are thought to work inside rebel-held areas, and few could explain why the Free Syrian Army would shoot into areas that were sympathetic to it. The glass through which the bullet passed was frosted, meaning the gunman would not have seen exactly who were his targets. But the deliberate nature of how indiscriminate this was made it all the more chilling. The family members were, at that time, calm. They believed that Rena was getting the best of care and prepared for their hazardous trip to government territory to see her. It seemed like there had been a miraculous escape. The next morning, we returned. Locals in the street broke the news to us. Rena was dead. It was hard to believe that the girl we had seen recover, and who appeared so free from the bullet that should have killed her, had died from her wounds. The family refused to speak to us at first. We were told the father was angry we had entered the home and feared reprisals. After an hour, one relative met us outside. They said Rena had been rushed to two government hospitals. At each, they said, doctors had tried to help her. At each, they failed. It appears the bullet, which we did not find inside their home, had lodged inside her throat. A sniper's bullet had killed a four-year-old girl, leaving us wondering how the violence now engulfing Aleppo will ever end, whether its civilians will ever recover life as they knew it.

"(CNN) -- A pair of illegal immigration ordinances in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, were ruled unconstitutional Thursday by a federal appeals court. In 2006, Hazleton passed the Illegal Immigration Relief Act Ordinance, which would have fined landlords who rented to undocumented immigrants and would have penalized companies that employed them. Under another law, tenants would have had to prove they were citizens or lawful residents, register with the city and pay for a rental permit in order to receive an occupancy permit. The ordinances were copied by other cities. Both were challenged before going into effect and found unconstitutional in 2007 by a U.S. District Court. The court ruled that Hazleton cannot enact any ordinances dealing with illegal immigration because they conflict with the supremacy clause of the U.S. constitution. ""Today's decision makes the Third Circuit the most liberal court in America on immigration issues,"" said a statement from Lou Barletta, Hazelton's mayor. ""This ruling is a loss for Hazleton and its legal residents."" But the American Civil Liberties Union called the decision by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, ""a major victory in the fight against state and local anti-immigration."" Hazelton attorney Kris Kobach said the city will appeal the case and is ready to take it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.","Federal court throws out laws limiting where illegal immigrants can live, work .

I just pray that I also dead with them. What would be my life worth now?"" She combs the debris, scours the morgues and pours over the list of victims found in Tacloban, Philippines. ""I don't have sons I don't know if they're dead or where their bodies are I don't know if dogs in the street are eating their bodies already."" Along with nearly 4,000 deaths, about 3 million people have been displaced, communities have been flattened and looting and violence have erupted. Survivors ask, 'Where was God?' The United States and Britain are bolstering their military assets to urgently help millions of hungry and homeless Filipinos -- socked, soaked and dazed more than a week after the typhoon clobbered the midsection of the Philippines. ""Right now, the U.S. military capability is continuing to grow,"" U.S. Marine Brig. Gen. Paul Kennedy told CNN on Sunday. ""We need to get life-sustaining aid immediately out to the stricken population. Food, water, shelter, medicine -- those are the basics."" Kennedy said numerous aircraft -- such a dozen C-130 cargo airplanes, more than a dozen MV-22 Ospreys and several dozen UH-60 helicopters -- are being deployed. About 9,000 U.S. troops are supporting the operation in the Philippines, a U.S. military official said. U.S. military assets have delivered approximately 623,000 pounds of relief supplies. As the Royal Australian Air Force drops off another load of supplies and humanitarian workers in Tacloban -- one of a number of nations helping this devastated country -- the piles of aid stack up on an airport tarmac . ""It's chaotic, but every day, it's improving, going out to affected communities very quickly,"" said USAID official Ben Hemingway Sunday. Thousands of refugees converged on the Tacloban airport terminal hoping to jump on the planes as they leave. ""I don't know what to do right now,"" one mother told CNN.  ""All I can think about is my daughters. I have to save them first."" The British ship HMS Daring arrived in Cebu on Sunday to provide medical assistance, emergency supplies and clean water to stranded victims, the UK government said. ""HMS Daring's arrival is a major boost to DFID's disaster experts and medical teams already deployed in the Philippines,"" Britain's International Development Secretary Justine Greening said, referring to the Department for International Development. Baby born in wreckage clings to life . ""This Royal Navy vessel will help us open a lifeline and allow us to help many more victims of the disaster,"" she said. The Philippine central government is being criticized for a slow and disorganized response to what all agree is a catastrophic event. The nation's disaster agency said between nine million and 13 million people were affected in 44 provinces, 536 municipalities and 55 cities. The United States and Britain are among nations across the globe racing against time to help Philippine authorities in a massive relief effort of delivering food and water to the devastated swaths of the archipelago. When the typhoon hit the central part of the country on November 8, many lost their homes and electric power. As the days went by, thousands were scrounging for food, clean water and medical aid.

She cited a bit of progress in helping the infrastructure in Tacloban, a major city that was ground zero for the typhoon strike. ""Yesterday, we were able to support UNCIEF in bringing the water system back on stream,"" she said. ""There are now 150,000 people in Tacloban being served by clean water.""

"Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston was awarded the 79th Heisman Trophy on Saturday, an honor that comes amid lingering questions about a rape allegation that has cast a pall over his claim to the coveted bronze statue. Winston, who was considered a frontrunner by many college analysts, led the top-ranked Seminoles as a freshman to an undefeated regular season and a chance to play for a national championship in January. ""It's a blessing. I don't even know what's going on right now, honestly. I'm just so happy. I'm overwhelmed,"" Winston told an audience during the presentation in New York. Winston wins Heisman in runaway . But even as Winston became only the second redshirt freshman to win the Heisman, questions swirled about a rape allegation made against him more than a year ago but made public only last month. Prosecutors declined this month to file a charge against Winston, but a news conference by his accuser's lawyer the day before the Heisman presentation kept fueling the story. Asked about the case on Friday, Winston -- who has maintained the sexual activity was consensual -- told reporters: ""I knew I did nothing wrong."" On Saturday, shortly before being awarded the Heisman, he told the audience that he wanted people to know that he was a family man who loved his life and his college experience. ""People just got to know I love life,"" he said. Winston recorded 3,820 passing yards and 38 passing touchdowns this year. He is only the second redshirt freshman to win the Heisman. The first freshman winner came last year, when Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel took the honor. At age 19, Winston is the youngest player to win the Heisman. He also is the third FSU player, behind Charlie Ward and Chris Weinke, to claim the honor. Winston led Florida State to a 13-0 regular season, setting the Seminoles up to take on the Auburn University Tigers in the BCS National Championship on January 6. The game will be played on Winston's 20th birthday. Power candidates for 2014 . Winston, who received 686 first-place votes according to Heisman trustees, finished ahead of Manziel, Auburn's Tre Mason,  University of Alabama's AJ McCarron, Northern Illinois University's Jordan Lynch and Boston College's Andre Williams. Winston's Heisman honor comes one day after attorney Patricia Carroll called on Florida officials to investigate how authorities in the state capital handled the now-closed investigation into the alleged sexual assault of her client. Carroll accused the Tallahassee police detective who handled the case of spending time and resources investigating her client instead of Winston. More than half of the 248-page investigative file authorities released to her consisted of records related to her client's telephone, social media and other records, Carroll said.  She said only 11 pages of the filed contained references to Winston, and some of the material released by authorities differed from those obtained by the woman's family. The lawyer also questioned how investigators handled and tested evidence in the case and said authorities failed to get warrants to examine video surveillance, Winston's apartment and other potential evidence that could have proven crucial to the case. Earlier this month, Willie Meggs, the state attorney for the 2nd Judicial Circuit, which includes Leon County and Tallahassee, announced that Winston would not be arrested. A key factor was the accuser's recollection of the events during the December 2012 incident, in which she alleged Winston raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a Tallahassee bar, according to Meggs. ""We have a duty as prosecutors to only file ... charges if we have a reasonable likelihood of a conviction,"" Meggs said at the time. ""We did not feel we could meet that burden."" The prosecutor said investigators did not have even probable cause to arrest Winston, which requires a low standard of proof. Winston's attorney, Tim Jansen, has said his client had consensual sex with the woman. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has spoken with the head of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement about the possibility of an inquiry, but no formal request has been received, spokesman Jenn Meale told CNN on Friday. According to police documents, the woman told investigators she had been drinking with friends at a Tallahassee bar called Potbelly's. She said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar. She said she did not remember much of what happened next but told investigators she remembered winding up in a ground-floor apartment, where a man took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections. She reported the alleged assault to campus police that night. The woman came forward a month after making her initial report to accuse Winston, but Tallahassee's interim Police Chief Tom Coe said last week that she ""broke off contact"" with investigators in February and said she didn't want to go forward with the case. The woman's family has claimed that a detective had warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a ""big football town"" and that her life could be miserable if she pursued the case. Carroll said the woman is not contemplating any civil litigation and is focusing on finishing final examinations at Florida State under special accommodations made by the school. She said the woman's sorority has been subjected to threats and has had some tires slashed.","At 19, Jameis Winston is the youngest player to win the Heisman Trophy .

"American golfer Johnson Wagner celebrated a new year with a new look and new-found confidence as he booked his spot at the Masters in Augusta with victory at the Sony Open in Hawaii on Sunday. The 31-year-old clinched his third PGA Tour title and rocketed up 106 places in the rankings to 92nd as he took the early lead in the FedEx Cup series, scooping the $990,000 first prize. Sporting a mustache he started growing last year during the off-season, he carded a three-under-par 67 in his final round to win by two shots at the Waialae Country Club. ""I was definitely telling people to expect something early this year, which is a nice feeling,"" Wagner told the PGA Tour's official website after following up his tie for ninth place in the season-opening Tournament of Champions at Kapalua last weekend. ""Usually, my confidence is low. I'm kind of shy in a little shell. And for some reason, I just had way more energy and confidence going into this year."" He revealed that he will keep his facial furniture after qualifying for April's opening major of the season, having won almost as much in two starts this year as he did in the whole of 2011 -- when his only win came in Mexico in February. ""I kind of made a deal with myself in December that if I was to get into the Masters, then I was going to keep the mustache for at least this year,"" he said after a bogey-free last 12 holes saw him finish on 13 under ahead of a four-way tie for second. ""Everybody said, 'Oh, is it a Movember mustache? Well, it's December, time to shave it.' I said, 'Look, this is not a one-month mustache. This is potentially a 10-year mustache.'"" Behind Wagner on 11 under was Sweden-born Carl Petterson (67), playing in his first tournament since becoming a U.S. citizen, and Americans Sean O'Hair (67), Harrison Frazar (67) and Charles Howell III (69). Their compatriots Michael Thompson (67), Brian Gay (67), D.A. Points (69) and Matt Every (72) tied for sixth on 10 under. John Rollins of the U.S. carded the best round of the day, hitting a superb 64 to finish alongside Canada's David Hearn (69) and Brendan de Jonge (71) of Zimbabwe in 10th. Keegan Bradley, the 2011 PGA Championship winner, shot 70 to finish on eight under in an six-way tie for 13th place. World No. 5 Steve Stricker, who won in Hawaii last Sunday, was nine shots behind Wagner after closing with 74. He was level with 2011 money list runner-up Webb Simpson (68), South Korean veteran K.J. Choi (71) and 2010 U.S. Ryder Cup captain Corey Pavin (71).","Johnson Wagner clinches the Sony Open in Hawaii to qualify for Masters in April .

"Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling is banned from the NBA for life. Sterling has confirmed it is his voice expressing racist views on audio of a private conversation that was leaked to the media. Some who have followed Sterling over the years say he had shown this side before and the leaked audio led to public outcry too loud for the NBA commissioner to ignore. But what of the recording itself? Was it legal to record? To leak? Here's a look at some of the legal aspects of the recorded conversation between Sterling and his alleged mistress, V. Stiviano, who said she recorded the conversation. Was it legal to record the conversation? It depends what state you are in during the conversation. Most states require that only one person have knowledge that a conversation is being recorded for it to be legal. But some states, like California, are ""two-party consent"" states where all of those involved in the conversation have to know they are being recorded for it to be legal. So depending on the location of the recording, if Sterling didn't know he was being recorded, the audio might very well have been obtained illegally. Stiviano's lawyer, however, told the Los Angeles Times that Sterling knew he was being recorded. The lawyer, Mac Nehoray, declined to tell the Times why Stiviano recorded the conversation, but said it was ""by mutual agreement,"" he told the Times. Banning Sterling good for NBA's bottom line . Was it legal to leak the audio? Though some may question the ethics of the act, if the audio was legally obtained, no laws were violated by leaking it to a reporter. The reporters who received the audio and disseminated its contents to the public also did nothing illegal, said Joel Kurtzberg, a New York attorney with expertise in First Amendment and media law. Stiviano's lawyer has said that Stiviano was not the one who released the audio to the media. Clippers unite and win . Was this a First Amendment violation? Have Sterling's First Amendment rights been violated? No, Kurtzberg said. No one is questioning that Sterling has the right to speak as he pleases, but the public and the NBA are also free to condemn what he says, Kurtzberg said. Marc J. Randazza, a Las Vegas-based First Amendment attorney, wrote in an op-ed for CNN that the NBA is private club and can punish Sterling as it sees fit. But, Randazza wrote, it was morally wrong to leak the audio and violate Sterling's privacy. We all say things in private that we may not say in public, he said, but ""we now live in a world where if you have any views that are unpopular, you now not only need to fear saying them in public, but you need to fear saying them at all -- even to your intimate friends.""

"People wait in long lines and even camp out to get their hands on new Apple devices as soon as they're available. But they drag their feet, sometimes for years, when it comes to purchasing another piece of technology that could greatly improve their lives: hearing aids. Hearing-aid manufacturers and audiologists hope a new collaboration between them and Apple will help. Danish hearing-aid company GN ReSound last week announced a new hearing aid that's compatible with the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Called LiNX, the device syncs wirelessly with the newest Apple mobile devices and takes advantage of iOS 7's new accessibility options for the hearing-impaired. At its most basic level, the LiNX acts like a hybrid of hearing aids and stereo Bluetooth headphones. Phone calls, FaceTime chats, music, movies, turn-by-turn navigation or other audio can be streamed directly to a small earpiece. When they're not pulling in audio from a smartphone or tablet, the hearing aids work like normal, picking up in-person conversations and surrounding sounds. Apple worked closely with ReSound on the hearing aid and assisted them in publicizing its launch. And this being Apple, there are plenty of bells and whistles packed into the device. A feature called Live Listen turns an iOS device into microphone. If someone's in a loud environment -- a busy meeting, a sporting event, a noisy car -- and wants to focus on one person's voice and cut down on background noise, they can get a stream directly from the smartphone's mic to their ears. (This feature has the potential for some fun eavesdropping mischief.) Using GPS, you can save custom settings for a specific location, say a movie theater or your cubicle at work, and get a pop-up notification on your mobile device asking whether you'd like to switch every time you return to that spot. Don't remember where you left your hearing aids? Use a phone or tablet to locate them. Apple and the device's makers hope it will encourage more people with hearing loss to get help earlier. ""Right now, people wait about eight years on average between the time they think they have a hearing problem and when they see someone about it,"" said audiologist Dr. Ken Smith. More than 36 million people in the U.S. have some hearing loss, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, but only one out of five people who need a hearing aid actually have one. Smith attributes this gap to antiquated stereotypes of hearing aids. People still picture the hardware as it was many years ago: large and obvious, making embarrassing whistling and beeping sounds, and ineffective at filtering out background noise. But today's models are quieter, discreet and more effective. And sprinkling a bit of Apple's magic on the devices could help decrease the stigma of wearing them. ""The association with Apple is going to make a great difference in getting people in the door in the first place,"" Smith said. Even the most advanced current hearing aids can still draw unwanted attention when wearers must reach to change the settings. For many hearing-impaired people, the biggest advantage of Apple-ized hearing aids is being able to control the devices' settings directly from a phone. With Apple integration, wearers can make adjustments as easily as they can check e-mail or watch a video. Basic settings like battery life and volume are built directly into the iOS 7 operating system. More advanced settings such as treble and bass can be set using the more complicated ReSound app. It's been possible for people to operate their hearing aids via custom remote controls and even link them to smartphones, but that has required an intermediary piece of hardware, most often a small, clunky box worn around the neck. Now, using a combination of Bluetooth and a proprietary Apple protocol, the LiNX hearing aids can communicate directly with Apple mobile devices. Flashy features aside, just being able to make calls on a smartphone is a big step. ""Cell phone calls are something that are very difficult for hearing aids to do,"" said Laurel Christensen, chief audiologist at ReSound, who helped develop the device. Smith, who is hearing-impaired himself and was part of an early test group using the hearing aids, said he used to avoid talking on his smartphone. When he did take a call, he would push the volume up on his phone and then place the receiver above his hearing aid, searching for the elusive sweet spot where he could best hear the caller. Now, he says, he actually prefers that people call him on his cell. The hearing aids are still specialized medical devices, meaning you won't find them on the shelves of your local Apple store. Customers must have their hearing tested and get fitted for the devices by an audiologist. And they're not cheap: A single LiNX hearing aid can cost about $3,000. Apple added support for the new technology when it released iOS 7 last year, but these are the first hearing aids to actually work with many of the system's accessibility features. Because of the specialized technology, a third-party hearing-aid maker can't just jump in and create devices that work with iOS without partnering directly with Apple. ReSound executives have not revealed whether they are developing hearing aids for Android devices or other platforms. ReSound worked on this specific technology for almost two years, so other companies might have some catching up to do. However long it takes, this marriage of medical and consumer technology is the first step into a welcome future for hearing-impaired people. ""This is the first generation, but there's no doubt that what we can do by marrying a phone and a hearing aid will explode,"" Christensen said.","Apple and Danish company ReSound have teamed up on a new hearing aid .
The technology pairs with the latest iPhone, iPad and iPod touch .

"Florida State has opened a Title IX investigation into the 2012 sexual assault case involving Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Jameis Winston, an attorney for the accuser said Friday. Winston could be charged by Florida State for a code of conduct violation against him for sexual misconduct. John Clune, an attorney representing the woman who accused Winston of sexually assaulting her in December 2012, said university officials interviewed his client last month. Clune said it ""was a very thorough interview"" and that the accuser, a Florida State student, ""felt like she was heard by the university."" ""They took it very seriously,"" Clune said. Florida State launched its investigation under the Title IX law, which requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault. This investigation is mandatory under the law even if criminal charges were not filed. Florida State, one of several universities under federal review for their handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints, would not comment on the investigation, citing state and federal student privacy laws. ""In general, complainants control the timing in our process,"" said Florida State Strategic Communications Adviser Browning Brooks. David Cornwell, an adviser to Winston's family, released a statement Thursday regarding Florida State's investigation. ""The real story here is that after her Colorado attorneys created a media frenzy alleging that Florida State University failed to comply with its Title IX obligations, (the accuser) had to come clean and admit that she previously refused to cooperate with the university's Title IX inquiry. ""Now that she has finally done her Title IX interview, this is the fourth time (the accuser) has told her story. We anticipate the same conclusion that followed her previous three statements to the Tallahassee Police Department, Florida's State Attorney's Office and in the FSU Code of Student Conduct hearing. Jameis Winston did not sexually assault (the accuser)."" Tim Jansen, Winston's attorney, has said his client had consensual sex with the woman. Willie Meggs, the Florida state attorney for the 2nd Judicial Circuit, which includes Leon County and Tallahassee, said in November that the investigators did not have probable cause to arrest Winston. According to police documents, the accuser said Winston raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a bar in Tallahassee. She said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar. The accuser also said she did not remember much of what happened next but that she remembered being in a ground-floor apartment, where a man took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections. The accuser reported the alleged assault to campus police that night. A month later, in January 2013, she accused Winston of the alleged rape. Tallahassee interim Police Chief Tom Coe said last year that she ""broke off contact"" with investigators in February 2013 and didn't want to go forward with the case. The woman's family says a detective warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a ""big football town"" and that life could be miserable if she pursued the case. After he won the Heisman, Winston and the Seminoles went on to win the BCS National Championship against Auburn. He spent this spring playing for the Florida State baseball team. Winston made headlines again in April when he was accused of shoplifting crab legs from a Publix supermarket in Tallahassee. Police said that Winston said he forgot to pay. Florida State remains No. 1 in the polls after a 37-31 win against Oklahoma State last week. Winston is once again seen as an early contender for the Heisman, college football's top award. It is given in December to the player who voters believe had the best college football season.","University opens a Title IX investigation into the 2012 case .

"President Barack Obama signed an executive order Monday banning federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Despite calls from religious leaders, faith-based groups will not be exempt. ""Thanks to your passion and advocacy and the irrefutable rightness of your cause, our government -- a government of the people, by the people and for the people -- will become just a little bit fairer,"" Obama said. Gay federal workers are already protected from workplace discrimination by a Clinton-era order and Obama's action extended the protections to shield workers from gender identity-based discrimination. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which joined a coalition of nearly 100 civil rights and LGBT groups urging Obama to reject calls for a religious exemption, thanked him for taking action. It said he made the ""right call"" for not tagging any religious exemptions to the document. ""Faith-based groups that tap the public purse should play by the same rules as everyone else and not expect special treatment,"" the group's executive director, Rev. Barry Lynn, said in a statement. ""No forms of discrimination should be supported with the taxpayer dime, period."" Rea Carey, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, was in the room as Obama signed the order and said it was an emotional moment. ""There are now millions of LGBT people and their families who are just going to sleep a little bit easier tonight knowing that they can't be fired from their jobs as federal contractors,"" she said. During the ceremony, which comes 50 years after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Obama also recalled the history of executive actions and legislation to ban discrimination in the workplace and ""make sure we the people applies to all the people."" Senate passes LGBT anti-discrimination bill . But Obama's signature on Monday did not touch a 2002 executive order signed by President George W. Bush that allows religious groups to weigh prospective employees' faith in hiring decisions. This gave some opponents of the order hope that they could continue to consider sexual orientation in hiring decisions. One of those opponents, Stephen Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies at The Catholic University of America, said he was disappointed by Obama's decision regarding the religious exemption. But he suggested that religious groups could still rely on the 2002 order. ""I believe the administration has left open a path that religious groups can work with,"" Schneck said. Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, had stronger words for Obama and worried that the Bush-era executive order would leave out some faith-based groups. ""While we don't know the full implications of this executive order, I am disappointed that this administration persistently violates the freedom of conscience for religious organizations that provide necessary relief for the poor and endangered,"" Moore said. ""The ones hurt will be the most vulnerable in our society."" Obama's executive action extends protections against sexual-based discrimination to employees of federal contractors operating outside of the 21 states and the District of Columbia that enacted their own non-discrimination legislation. Obama also noted that a majority of Fortune 500 companies have policies in place against discrimination based on sexual orientation. The action is not the first time Obama has used his presidential powers to benefit the LGBT community. In 2010, he signed an order extending benefits to same-sex partners of executive branch employees already provided to opposite-sex partners. But on the federal legislative level, LGBT groups have struggled to enact similar legislation. The Senate passed a bill barring LGBT discrimination in the fall. But the measure, which exempted religious groups from the would-be-law, did not make it to the House floor where Republicans opposed it. And attendees greeted Obama's call to continue applying pressure to ""resolve this problem once and for all"" with one resounding word: ""Amen.""

"(CNN)  -- Novak Djokovic left the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court to jeers and catcalls after his U.S. Open quarterfinal victory over Andy Roddick on Thursday night. Novak Djokovic celebrates after defeating Andy Roddick at the U.S. Open on Thursday. The Flushing Meadows crowd was enraged by comments the Serbian made in his post-match interview in which he criticized home favorite Roddick in no uncertain terms. Djokovic had been angered by apparently light-hearted remarks made by Roddick in which he accused the world number three of feigning injuries. ""That's not nice, anyhow, to say in front of this crowd that I have 16 injuries and that I'm faking,"" Djokovic blurted out after his four-set victory. ""They're already against me, because they think I'm faking everything."" In Djokovic's last 16 match, a tough five-setter against Tommy Robredo, the reigning Australian Open champion called for the trainer several times as he dealt with hip, ankle, stomach and breathing issues. Asked then about Djokovic's problems, Roddick joked whether the list shouldn't also include bird flu, anthrax, SARS and a common cold and said: . ""He's either quick to call a trainer or he's the most courageous guy of all time."" What most irritated Djokovic was what Roddick said in an on-court interview on Tuesday: ""I've got to feel good. He's got about 16 injuries right now."" The remarks certainly acted as motivation, but he owed his 6-2 6-3 3-6 7-6 victory to uncharacteristic serving errors by eighth seed Roddick. After working his way back from a huge deficit, Roddick was two points from forcing a fifth set at 5-4, 30-love in the fourth. But he double-faulted twice in a row and was broken for the fifth time -- twice more than he lost serve in his first four matches combined. ""You know what? I honestly don't feel like they were super-tight doubles,"" Roddick told the Associated Press. ""I had been playing pretty high-risk, high-reward tennis to get back and I probably wasn't about to stop."" Roddick was also asked about his verbal squabble with Djokovic and immediately apologized. ""It was completely meant in jest,"" Roddick said, pausing to choose the right words. ""I should know better. But listen, I joke all the time. I don't think anyone in their right mind takes me serious."" Both men spoke in private after the incident and Djokovic was also contrite in his post-match press conference. ""He made a joke and it was a misunderstanding, so I don't blame it on him,"" Djokovic said. ""Maybe I exaggerated and reacted bad in that moment. I apologize."" Third seed Djokovic was advancing to a semifinal meeting with former world number one Roger Federer, a rematch of last year's U.S. Open final, which Federer won for his fourth consecutive title at Flushing Meadows. Federer -- bidding for a 13th major title, one shy of Pete Sampras' record -- beat qualifier Gilles Muller 7-6  6-4 7-6 earlier on Thursday, again looking less than convincing in extending his own record by reaching the semifinals at an 18th consecutive grand slam tournament. New world number one Rafael Nadal will face Britain's Andy Murray in the other semifinal on '""Super Saturday."" The men's semifinals and women's final are all scheduled for Saturday, but tournament organizers have seen forecasts calling for about 12 hours of rain and wind at up to 35 mph that day. So they began the process of negotiating with TV networks and preparing contingency plans, including weighing the possibility of announcing Friday that no tennis would be played Saturday, and that the men's final would be shifted from Sunday to Monday. In the women's semifinals on Friday, two-time champion Serena Williams faces Dinara Safina, and Jelena Jankovic meets Elena Dementieva. Copyright 2008 CNN.

"A Native American actress with small roles in ""August: Osage County,"" ""Frozen River"" and other films has been missing since she left a suburban Seattle apartment more than a week ago, her family said. Misty Upham, 32, was last seen October 5 walking from her sister's apartment in Muckleshoot, Washington, according to a statement sent to media outlets by her father, Charles Upham. Nobody in her family has heard from her since, he said. In a statement posted Sunday to the actress' Facebook page, Charles Upham said his daughter has bipolar disorder and bouts of anxiety and depression, but he does not believe she would harm herself. ""As her father I do not fear she committed suicide,"" he wrote. ""I think Misty may have walked into nearby woods and got hurt and can't reach help or I think she may have had an encounter with someone who may have caused her harm. I believe she would contact us if she could,"" he added. ""I feel that if she is found soon she may have a chance to survive. But time is slipping away."" Upham's family has been searching the neighborhood, hanging posters and checking with area shelters and hospitals, her father said. The actress is a member of the Blackfoot tribe. She had cut her hair short and was last seen wearing a purple sweater, black T-shirt, gray sweatpants and silver tennis shoes, her father said. She was carrying an ID and a white cell phone, he said. Police in nearby Auburn, Washington said Monday they're searching for Upham and that she has been listed as a missing person in the Washington Crime Information Center (WACIC) database. Upham was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for her supporting role in the 2008 drama ""Frozen River,"" about two women who earn money smuggling illegal immigrants into the United States from Canada. She played a housekeeper in  ""August: Osage County,"" the 2013 family drama starring Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. According to the Internet Movie Database, Upham also had an uncredited role in ""Django Unchained"" and a small part in the upcoming ""Cake,"" starring Jennifer Aniston. Upham's family asks anyone with information about her disappearance that could be helpful to contact her father at charlesupham@gmail.com or the Auburn, Washington, Police Department at (253) 288-2121.

"Animal welfare groups have criticized the ""utterly barbaric"" whipping of a horse which competed in a race against Paralympic icon Oscar Pistorius. The South African double amputee, who made history by competing in the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, beat an Arab horse in a race in Doha, Qatar on Wednesday -- as part of a campaign highlighting contributions made by people with disabilities. World Horse Welfare, a body which advises on rules for international equestrian competitions, branded the treatment of the horse, which started the race 15 meters behind Pistorius, as a ""disgrace"". ""World Horse Welfare are appalled at the way the jockey used the whip which was not only completely unnecessary but utterly barbaric,"" the organization told CNN. ""Excessive whip use like this is a disgrace to racing as a sport. We applaud the achievements of Oscar Pistorius and his race could have been a great spectacle, but instead it was marred by the flagrant abuse of this horse."" Prior to the race against Pistorius, World Horse Welfare had said it had no problem with the horse competing  providing it was treated fairly. ""We commented on the race beforehand to say we didn't see any immediate welfare concerns providing the horse was treated well. Clearly it wasn't,"" said the body's deputy chief executive Tony Tyler. In a statement to CNN, six-time Paralympic gold medalist Pistorius -- who also reached the semifinals of the Olympic 400 meters competition -- said he was unaware of any ill treatment to the horse. ""I participated in the race in good faith as it was to promote abilities across sport and I was totally unaware of any alleged excessive force being used on the horse,"" said the 26-year-old. ""I don't condone any ill-treatment of animals and would always hope that a horse would be ridden in the correct way. Those who know me well are very aware of my well-publicized care and love of animals."" The organizers of the race were not immediately available for comment. The use of the whip in horse racing has been a source of controversy in recent years, notably in Britain. Regulator British Horseracing Association completed a 10-month review of whip regulations in November 2011, recommending its use be regulated, with bans issued for excessive use. Penalties, which can include losing prize money, become more severe depending on the number of times a jockey breaches regulations.","Animal rights organizations criticize ""barbaric"" whipping of horse which raced against Oscar Pistorius .

"A debilitating, mosquito-borne virus called chikungunya has made its way to North Carolina, health officials say. It's the state's first reported case of the virus. The patient was likely infected in the Caribbean, according to the Forsyth County Department of Public Health. Chikungunya is primarily found in Africa, East Asia and the Caribbean islands, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been watching the virus,+ for fear that it could take hold in the United States -- much like West Nile did more than a decade ago. The virus, which can cause joint pain and arthritis-like symptoms, has been on the U.S. public health radar for some time. About 25 to 28 infected travelers bring it to the United States each year, said Roger Nasci, chief of the CDC's Arboviral Disease Branch in the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. ""We haven't had any locally transmitted cases in the U.S. thus far,"" Nasci said. But a major outbreak in the Caribbean this year -- with more than 100,000 cases reported -- has health officials concerned. Experts say American tourists are bringing chikungunya back home, and it's just a matter of time before it starts to spread within the United States. After all, the Caribbean is a popular one with American tourists, and summer is fast approaching. ""So far this year we've recorded eight travel-associated cases, and seven of them have come from countries in the Caribbean where we know the virus is being transmitted,"" Nasci said. Other states have also reported cases of chikungunya. The Tennessee Department of Health said the state has had multiple cases of the virus in people who have traveled to the Caribbean. The virus is not deadly, but it can be painful, with symptoms lasting for weeks. Those with weak immune systems, such as the elderly, are more likely to suffer from the virus' side effects than those who are healthier. The good news, said Dr. William Shaffner, an infectious disease expert with Vanderbilt University in Nashville, is that the United States is more sophisticated when it comes to controlling mosquitoes than many other nations. ""We live in a largely air-conditioned environment, and we have a lot of screening (window screens, porch screens),"" Shaffner said. ""So we can separate the humans from the mosquito population, but we cannot be completely be isolated."" Chikungunya was originally identified in East Africa in the 1950s. The ecological makeup of the United States supports the spread of an illness such as this, especially in the tropical areas of Florida and other Southern states, according to the CDC. The other concern is the type of mosquito that carries the illness. Unlike most mosquitoes that breed and prosper outside from dusk to dawn, the chikungunya virus is most often spread to people by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. These are the same mosquitoes that transmit the virus that causes dengue fever. They bite mostly during the daytime. The disease is transmitted from mosquito to human, human to mosquito and so forth. A female mosquito of this type lives three to four weeks and can bite someone every three to four days. Shaffner and other health experts recommend people remember the mosquito-control basics: . • Use bug spray if you are going out, especially in tropical, or wooded areas near water. • Get rid of standing water, empty plastic pools, flower pots and pet dishes, so mosquitoes don't breed. • Dress appropriately, with long sleeves and pants.

"There are nine of us from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention in Lagos, Nigeria. We arrived from different U.S. states, or from the CDC's polio team already in Nigeria, and possess varying skill sets, including infection control, global migration and quarantine, data management, epidemiology and communications. We're here to work with colleagues and partners from Nigeria's Ministry of Health, UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization to stop the largest Ebola outbreak in history -- the first in a densely populated, urban environment. Nigeria is the latest country to become affected by the outbreak. The first person to die of Ebola here was an American named Patrick Sawyer, who arrived from Liberia. Now WHO suspects Nigeria has had 12 cases and three deaths. Our team in Lagos is a small part of the CDC's effort to fight Ebola, with work going on in several African countries, and back in the United States at our headquarters in Atlanta. There, the CDC's Emergency Operations Center has activated its highest level to maintain 24/7 operations to coordinate the agency's efforts. We are five hours ahead of Atlanta, a fact my family has yet to grasp as I receive texts during odd hours asking, ""What's Lagos like?"" and ""What are you doing?"" Good questions. A typical day for our team begins at a hotel -- one big advantage of an urban outbreak. After breakfast we move to one of several locations, including the hospital, U.S. Consulate or a training site, depending on the work to be done that day. Team Lagos is working as part of a much larger team in Nigeria to find and isolate all possible patients, tracking down everyone who could have been exposed to Ebola, and educating the public about the risks. A great deal has been accomplished in a short time. A Nigerian emergency operations center is up and running now, and we are about to move Ebola patients into a newly, remodeled treatment facility. There are 60 folks on the contact tracing team, which has been tracking more than 200 people thought to have come in contact with the virus. These teams visit the contacts daily to take their temperatures and check to see if they have developed any symptoms. On Tuesday, 147 of the 152 contacts were visited and assessed. When difficulties arise locating contacts, additional teams are employed and efforts ramped up to conduct the tracing. The Ebola response team in Nigeria recently saw 30 people finish the 21-day risk period -- the longest time period during which Ebola symptoms have been known to be present. These 30 people were able to leave the contact tracing list, which is a hopeful sign. There is a great deal of fear in Lagos as many worry about a virus of which they know precious little. CDC communicators like myself work to provide accurate information to the public and health care workers. Health care workers are critical as they are on the front lines of this battle; WHO says 10% of the deaths during this epidemic have been health care workers. Our infection control experts have been training workers on proper infection control and teaching them how to don Personal Protective Equipment properly, a critical task given this virus. I was taking pictures of this training near the Ebola ward when one of the trainers came out of the ""hot zone"" and asked if anybody had a paperback to give one of the patients. I donated a weathered copy of Shakespeare's ""Henry the IV, Part 1."" (I always carry a book on deployments). So the Bard has entered the Ebola ward in Lagos. One interesting aspect of this outbreak has been the rumors and misinformation spurred by Ebola. Last week, communicators were working quickly to respond to a rumor that bathing in or drinking salt water would prevent Ebola. I have seen local press coverage that notes two people may have died from attempting this treatment. As I write this, we are in a temporary emergency operations center at a psychiatric hospital, waiting for remodeling to be complete on our own center. We made the change with some grumbling but did not miss a beat -- flexibility is essential in an evolving outbreak situation. Our work is made more difficult by traffic in the city, a lack of Internet connectivity and security, which is a concern. We typically make it back to the hotel late, anywhere between 9 and 11 p.m. local time and try to eat together. Team members who gather are tired, and the outbreak dominates the conversation. But we also try to distract ourselves: On my third night, a team member asked, ""Has anyone else noticed that the background music is all Celine Dione?"" It was true. Turns out she has quite a few songs, and I am pretty sure we have heard them all. I am not afraid of catching the Ebola virus. I know how Ebola is transmitted and will not put myself in jeopardy, thinking of my wife and four children at home. The work is long, hard, challenging but worthwhile. The CDC team in Lagos is amazing, one of the best I have been on. And the larger response team that includes all our partners and our colleagues from Nigeria is doing important work to break the Ebola infection cycle.","The CDC has sent nine people to Lagos, Nigeria, to fight the Ebola outbreak .

"A California lawmaker has scheduled a hearing to examine disclosures of significant fraud in taxpayer-funded drug rehabilitation by The Center for Investigative Reporting and CNN. Dr. Richard Pan, chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, wants to know how the problem persisted for so long, even as state health authorities expanded their efforts this week to shut down questionable clinics. ""A lot of people seemed to know what was going on, but for some reason, they didn't seem to be acting on what was going on,"" said Pan, a Democrat who represents the Sacramento area. ""It seemed like it was hiding in plain sight."" A yearlong investigation by CIR and CNN found widespread fraud and poor oversight in the state's alcohol and drug counseling program for the poor, called Drug Medi-Cal. It is part of the nation's largest Medicaid program. In the wake of that investigation, another California lawmaker has called for an independent audit into the troubled program. Los Angeles County officials also are proposing reforms aimed at tightening clinic oversight. Some clinics say they've done nothing wrong . Some of the clinics, however, are fighting back. Several of those temporarily suspended by the state are filing appeals. ""These people have done nothing wrong,"" said Arthur Barens, a Los Angeles attorney who is appealing the suspensions of several clinics. ""They have not shown us any evidence of wrongdoing. I think that offends any concept of due process."" Pan said he will examine the issue during a hearing on Medi-Cal oversight already scheduled for September. ""I'm hoping first to identify where the gaps are that allow the Drug Medi-Cal fraud to happen,"" he said. ""Basically, what broke down?"" State Sen. Ted Lieu, a Democrat who represents parts of Los Angeles County, called for an independent review of the rehab program by the state auditor. ""I want to know ... what can we do to change laws or regulations so the fraud doesn't occur in the future,"" Lieu told CNN on Tuesday. He said he was motivated by his belief in rehabilitation programs as a crucial tool for reducing crime and the prison population. ""I became very concerned,"" Lieu said, ""that if we don't fix this fraud immediately, it would undercut the public support for this entire program."" Watch Anderson Cooper's interview with Lieu . Related: California lawmakers order audit of taxpayer-funded rehab program . Infographic: Rehab investigation gets results . State agency widens crackdown this week . The state agency responsible for policing the rehab clinics, the Department of Health Care Services, widened its crackdown this week, announcing Friday it had temporarily suspended 46 clinics with 62 satellite counseling sites -- raising its previous total of suspended clinics by 13. The department won't disclose which clinics have been targeted. Department spokesman Norman Williams pledged that the dragnet would be expanded even further. ""We're going to make sure people who have defrauded the program are punished,"" he said on Bay Area public radio station KQED on Tuesday. ""You can expect penalties, you can expect jail time and the top thing you can expect is a refocus, a stronger focus on making sure that these things are not happening in the future."" On Wednesday, the state Department of Justice said 36 clinics so far have been referred for investigation. One client of Barens confirmed that her two South Los Angeles rehab clinics, Changing Steps and Pom-Pom's Castle, were suspended. The state's suspension letter stated that Belinda Baker's clients do not meet requirements for receiving services -- implying that they might not be addicts. ""Every single person we have (has) an addiction problem,"" Baker said. ""They're condemning us without really investigating us."" Baker said another suspended clinic might be the source of her problems. She said a county auditor recently informed her that Able Family Support -- a clinic run by a man with a 2000 organized crime conviction in Texas -- was billing for clients she was serving. ""That place is billing the same people we're billing, and they're sitting right here in group,"" Baker said. ""We're getting caught up in something, and I don't even know what's going on."" Able Family's executive director, Alexander Ferdman, did not respond to a phone call. County authorities have been trying to determine why reporters observed no more than 30 people enter Ferdman's clinic during a stakeout in April. The clinic later billed for seeing 179 clients that day. Related: Ferdman responds to CNN's questions . Group therapy patient: 'All you can do is pray' Jerome Sanders, 53, said he's gone to group therapy sessions for a year at Baker's Changing Steps clinic. He credits the facility with helping him stay off crack cocaine and said he's disappointed that it's stopped offering counseling. ""You never get strong enough; all you can do is pray,"" Sanders said. Sanders said he hasn't been to another Drug Medi-Cal clinic since Changing Steps closed its doors in mid-July because ""there's nowhere to go."" ""Every now and then, I'll go to an AA meeting just to keep my sobriety going,"" he said. Baker's clinics have been cited in county audits for problems including billing for therapy sessions when counselors were off work and other practices investigators labeled as ""directly indicative of a lack of integrity."" Her lawyer, Barens, said audits tend to ""result in some kind of adjustment being made, but it's always been very minor."" Barens said his other clients are R.I.G.H.T. Program, the New Choice Recovery Treatment Center, all also in Los Angeles County. Another of Barens' clients was eventually taken off the suspension list, according to county officials. Barens has requested in-person hearings, he said, and is filing appeals with state officials to speed up the process and restore funding. All five of his clients and at least three other suspended clinics, including Able Family Support, employ the same medical director, Dr. Howard Oliver. Oliver said the clinics do important work but might be sloppy with their paperwork and employ ""uneducated"" counselors who make mistakes. ""I don't think it's fair,"" Oliver said. ""They're not dishonest."" The attorney for Immaculate Care Center in Riverside County also said that clinic has been suspended and is appealing. ""It's a really sad state of affairs, especially because we don't know what went wrong,"" said Joseph Benincasa. ""If we did something wrong, we want to correct it."" The suspension letter cites a 2009 fraud prosecution against Immaculate Care's leaders, Godday Imakavar and Japhet Ifejoku. Imakavar was convicted and banned from billing Medi-Cal. The attorney said Imakavar remains on the clinic's board of directors but has little to do with the clinic. Ifejoku has been a fugitive avoiding the 2009 charges, yet remained the clinic's executive director. Benincasa said he was removed from his post in June, an action that occurred after CIR made inquiries. Regulators suggest reforms to Drug Medi-Cal . Noting the CIR and CNN investigation and the state crackdown, Los Angeles County regulators suggested reforms to the Drug Medi-Cal program. In a memo to the county Board of Supervisors, Public Health Director Dr. Jonathan Fielding recommended that the state toughen requirements for clinics to become certified and make certification provisional for the first two years. ""Quite frankly,"" he wrote in an e-mail, ""we've been frustrated in the past over the lax standards of state certification and the time it has taken the state to investigate and take action suspending and removing certification from bad actors."" Fielding called the fraud uncovered by reporters ""a tragedy."" He said the county won't be satisfied until ""every unscrupulous operator is out of business and brought to justice."" At the same time that state authorities began suspending clinics suspected of illegality, county officials announced a more than $191,000 funding increase for New Choice Recovery Treatment Center. The county immediately suspended those payments, Fielding said, adding that the mistake was ""unacceptable"" and underscores the need for better communication between the state and county.

"(CNN) -- Pakistan finished top of Group A after inflicting Australia's first defeat in 35 matches at the Cricket World Cup on Saturday, a run which has seen Ricky Ponting's team win the title three times since 1999. It was the veteran Ponting's first reverse in 28 World Cup matches as captain, and means his team will likely face fellow heavyweights India or England in the quarterfinals after finishing third in the seven-nation pool. Pakistan's reward for the four-wicket victory in Colombo is a likely clash with the West Indies or England. The last-eight scenario will be known on Sunday after India take on the Windies -- England have already played all their round-robin fixtures. Murali helps Sri Lanka secure second place . Pakistan went into the match against Australia in fourth place, a point behind New Zealand -- who will now play Group B winners South Africa following the Proteas' 206-run thrashing of co-hosts Bangladesh earlier on Saturday. Australia, seeking a fifth title in the 10th staging of the 50-over tournament, posted a poor total of 176 all out -- the team's lowest at a World Cup since 1992 -- as Pakistan's opening bowler Umar Gul took 3-30 and all-rounder Abdul Razzaq chipped in with 2-8. Opener Brad Haddin top-scored with 42 while vice-captain Michael Clarke made 34 as the Australians were bowled out in 46.4 overs. Veteran fast bowler Brett Lee made Pakistan battle as he claimed four wickets but Asad Shafiq continued his promising start to his international career with 46 and 20-year-old Umar Akmal was unbeaten at the end on 44. With Pakistan teetering a little on 142-6, Razzaq weighed in with 20 off 24 balls to guide his team home with nine overs to spare. South Africa secured a fifth win in six outings by ending Bangladesh's hopes of progressing with a one-sided victory in Dhaka. Jacques Kallis (69), Faf du Plessis (52) and opener Hashim Amla (51) all made half-centuries as the Proteas compiled a daunting 284-8, with captain Graeme Smith contributing 45 to a first-wicket stand of 97. Bangladesh then collapsed to 78 all out, mirroring the earlier capitulation against the West Indies which yielded 20 fewer runs. Left-arm fast bowler Lonwabo Tsotsobe claimed three early wickets, and spin bowler Robin Peterson continued the steady flow of departing batsmen with impressive figures of 4-12 from his seven overs.","Pakistan beat Australia by four wickets in Colombo to claim top spot in Group A .

"(CNN)The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to India's Kailash Satyarthi and Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai for their struggles against the suppression of children and for young people's rights, including the right to education. Thorbjorn Jagland, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said, ""Children must go to school, not be financially exploited."" Yousafzai came to global attention after she was shot in the head by the Taliban -- two years ago Thursday -- for her efforts to promote education for girls in Pakistan. Since then, after recovering from surgery, she has taken her campaign to the world stage, notably with a speech last year at the United Nations. Through her heroic struggle, Yousafzai has become a leading spokeswoman for girls' rights to education, said Jagland. According to the Nobel committee, at 17 she's the youngest ever peace prize winner. Yousafzai said that the award is a ""great honor for me,"" and that she's honored to share it with Satyarthi. ""I'm proud that I'm the first Pakistani and the first young woman or the first young person getting this award,"" she said in Birmingham, England. Yousafzai learned she won the award while she was in chemistry class in England on Friday morning, she said. She wasn't expecting to get the award, and at 10:15 a.m., she was sure she hadn't won. But soon afterward, a teacher called her over and told her she had. Yousafzai said she continued to attend classes, and it was a ""normal day,"" besides teachers and fellow students congratulating her. She said she doesn't believe that she deserved the award but considers it an encouragement to continue her campaign and ""to know that I'm not alone,"" Yousafzai told reporters. New beginnings . Her award will not mark the end of her campaign to advocate for girls' education, she said. ""I think this is really the beginning,"" she said, adding that children around the world ""should stand up for their rights"" and ""not wait for someone else."" Yousafzai spoke with Satyarthi by phone Friday, and they agreed to work together to advocate that every child is able to go to school. She said they also decided to try to build a stronger relationship between their countries, which are longtime rivals. She said she wants the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan to attend the December ceremony where she and Satyarthi will receive their awards. Peace between the two nations, Yousafzai said, is important for their progress. Awarding the Peace Prize to a Pakistani Muslim and an Indian Hindu ""gives a message to people of love between Pakistan and India, and between different religions,"" Yousafzai said. The decision sends a message that all people, regardless of language and religion, should fight for the rights of women, children and every human being. The Malala Fund, set up to promote girls' education, said via Twitter that Yousafzai called the prize ""an encouragement for me to go forward. It means we are standing together to ensure all children get quality education."" Committee commends Satyarthi's courage . Meanwhile, Satyarthi, age 60, has shown great personal courage in heading peaceful demonstrations focusing on the grave exploitation of children for financial gain, the committee said. Satyarthi told reporters that the award was about many more people than him -- and that credit should go to all those ""sacrificing their time and their lives for the cause of child rights"" and fighting child slavery. ""It is a great honor for all those children who are deprived of their childhood globally,"" he said. ""It's an honor to all my fellow Indians who have got this honor -- it's not just an honor for me, it's an honor for all those fighting against child labor globally."" 'She has made her countrymen proud' Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif congratulated Yousafzai. ""She is (the) pride of Pakistan, she has made her countrymen proud,"" he is quoted as saying in a statement. ""Her achievement is unparalleled and unequaled. ""Girls and boys of the world should take lead from her struggle and commitment."" His Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, congratulated both Nobel laureates via Twitter. ""Kailash Satyarthi has devoted his life to a cause that is extremely relevant to entire humankind. I salute his determined efforts,"" he said, adding that ""Malala Yousafzai's life is a journey of immense grit (and) courage."" A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, formally known as Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, via email called Yousafzai a ""beloved servant"" of ""infidels"" who was awarded the Nobel ""for her services to them."" The Islamist group, which has intimate links to the Afghan Taliban and al Qaeda, unabashedly confirmed two years ago that it tried to kill the teen activist as she rode home from school in a van. The spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan, said she was targeted because of what he called her ""propaganda against Islam."" Nobel Peace Prize: They didn't win, either . The Nobel committee said it ""regards it as an important point for a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani, to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism. ""It has been calculated that there are 168 million child labourers around the world today. In 2000 the figure was 78 million higher. The world has come closer to the goal of eliminating child labour."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated both winners, describing Yousafzai as ""a brave and gentle advocate of peace who through the simple act of going to school became a global teacher"" and Satyarthi as having carried out heroic work to combat child exploitation. ""The true winners today are the world's children,"" he added. Opinion: Malala is the new symbol of hope . 'Absolutely thrilled' Nigel Chapman, chief executive of the Plan International aid organization, said the award brought a ""fantastic glow"" to his heart. ""I think anybody who's interested in campaigning for children's rights is absolutely thrilled by this news,"" he said, speaking to CNN from New York. ""It's often hard to get these issues at the top of the agenda, and the fact that these two really important figures have been honored today is terrific news."" Chapman praised the Nobel committee for its smart move in awarding the prize jointly to Yousafzai and Satyarthi, who are ""two major heroes"" in their countries. The issues of education and child labor are intimately linked together, he said, ""because one of the reasons that girls in particular don't go to school is because they are working, often in difficult and dangerous circumstances, trying to earn money for their families."" There are still 65 million girls worldwide who are not in school, he said. Millions start lessons but drop out for reasons including having to work or being forced to marry very young. He said it was also a great boost for campaigners on the eve of the International Day of the Girl. Pakistani campaigner: Hard work is needed . Mosharraf Zaidi, a Pakistani education campaigner and former adviser to the Foreign Ministry, welcomed the award but cautioned that there is still a long way to go in his country. In Pakistan, he told CNN, there are 25 million children ages 5 to 16 who are not in school, more than half of whom are girls. ""So there's a huge need for a campaigner and a voice like Malala's,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, that voice hasn't been welcome in Pakistan in the way that we would've hoped and the work that needs to be done to fulfill the dreams that Malala has, has not yet begun. ""Pakistan's politicians have become very good at paying lip service to the needs of Pakistan's children without doing any of the hard work that's needed."" Pakistan needs to dramatically increase its spending on education and improve how that money is spent, he said, and it ""needs to get serious"" about giving every child a good education. Courage, determination and vision . Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is the U.N. special envoy for global education,  described the two winners as ""the world's greatest children's champions."" They ""deserve the Nobel Peace Prize for their courage, determination and for their vision that no child should ever be left behind and that every child should have the best of chances,"" he said. ""Kailash's life-long work in India fighting child labour -- which I have had the privilege to see at first hand -- complements Malala's work standing up for girls' rights to education from Pakistan to the rest of the world."" European Union leaders Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy said the prize was a victory for all the children around the world who aspire to go to school. When the European Union won the peace prize in 2012, they said, it decided to use the money for the same purpose, through an EU program for children in conflict zones. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said the award sends an important message of support to all those working for children's rights and rewards ""two extraordinarily inspirational human rights defenders"" who ""have demonstrated tremendous courage in the face of powerful adversaries."" He said he hoped it would bolster the political will of countries and institutions worldwide to uphold the rights of children. Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, hailed the pair's work as representing the struggle of millions of children around the world. ""This is an award for human rights defenders who are willing to dedicate themselves entirely to promoting education and the rights of the world's most vulnerable children,"" he said. Prerequisite for peace . The Norwegian Nobel Committee makes the point that 60% of the current population is under 25 years of age in the poorest countries of the world. ""It is a prerequisite for peaceful global development that the rights of children and young people be respected,"" it said. ""In conflict-ridden areas in particular, the violation of children leads to the continuation of violence from generation to generation."" Yousafzai was among the favorites for the prize last year, which instead went to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, for its longstanding efforts to ""do away with a whole category of weapons of mass destruction."" The Norwegian Nobel Committee received a record 278 nominations for the 2014 prize, 47 of which were for organizations. Each prize carries with it a monetary reward of 8 million Swedish kronor (about $1.1 million) to be divided among the winners. CNN's Ray Sanchez, Lindsay Isaac, Alexander Felton, Sophia Saifi and Radina Gigova contributed to this report.","Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai: Children around the world ""should stand up for their rights""

"NFL star Adrian Peterson turned himself in to authorities early Saturday in east Texas, one day after news broke that Peterson had in the local prosecutor's view hurt his child  ""with criminal negligence or recklessly"" under the guise of discipline. Shortly after reporting to authorities, Peterson posted $15,000 bail and was released, according to the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. That $15,000 likely won't make much of a dent on Peterson's checkbook. He agreed to a lucrative contract in 2011 with the Minnesota Vikings, which numerous publications, including NFL.com, reported would be worth $100 million (including $36 million guaranteed) over a 7-year period. Still, the charge he faces has already impacted Peterson negatively: He won't play Sunday, at least, after the Vikings deactivated him for their game with the New England Patriots. And the NFL said it was reviewing the incident under league's personal conduct policy. Peterson hasn't spoken publicly since a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of child abuse. But his lawyer has, saying that Peterson used ""a switch to spank his son"" in doling out discipline much like ""he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas."" ""(Peterson) will continue to insist on his innocence of any intended wrongdoing,"" the attorney, Rusty Hardin, said Friday. On Saturday, Montgomery County Assistant District Attorney Phil Grant -- whose office made the case against Peterson to the grand jury over a period of weeks -- said prosecutors ""will take this charge extremely seriously and we look forward to presenting this case to a jury."" According to Texas law, a person can be convicted of injury to a child if they are proven to have caused bodily or mental injury ""intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence"" or causing such harm by omission. The crime is punishable by up to two years in a state jail and a $1,000 fine. In Texas, someone can defend himself against a charge of injury to a child if they can prove it happened while they were administering ""reasonable discipline,"" Grant said. But that's not what prosecutors think happened in Peterson's case. ""Obviously, parents are entitled to discipline their children as they see fit, except for when that discipline exceeds what the community would say is reasonable,"" the district attorney said. ""And so, a grand jury, having indicted this case, looked at the injuries that were inflicted upon this child and determined that that discipline was not reasonable."" NFL fallout . News of Peterson's indictment rocked the NFL. Part of it has to do with the fact that Peterson has long been one of the league's most popular and successful players. His best campaign was in 2012, when the Palestine, Texas, born player earned Most Valuable Player honors after rushing for 2,097 yards, just nine yards short of the single-season mark. The historic 2012 campaign came after a potentially career-ending knee injury. Peterson's 2-year-old son was found unresponsive last year in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and later died of what authorities said were injuries consistent with abuse. Joseph Robert Patterson, the boyfriend of the boy's mother, has been charged with murder in that case. The felony injury to a child charge also comes at a tough time for the NFL generally because of the Ray Rice case. League officials have been heavily criticized for their actions in that case, including the initial two-game suspension given to Rice prior to surveillance video that emerged showing him delivering a knockout blow to then-fiancee Janay Palmer in a casino elevator. (The two are now married.) After that video came out earlier this week, Commissioner Roger Goodell made Rice's suspension indefinite. That decision was not enough, however, to placate critics -- especially after reports surfaced that NFL executives allegedly had received a copy in April of the damning video from inside the elevator and that Rice himself might have admitted in June to Goodell that he'd punched Palmer. These reports have shifted more criticism to Goodell and other NFL executives. Rice certainly hasn't gotten a pass either, especially with his future up in the air and the video showing him hitting Palmer being played again and again on sports and news broadcasts. Still, he has gotten some support. He returned Saturday to watch a high school football game in his hometown of New Rochelle, New York, which is a New York City suburb. He was joined on the sidelines by Palmer. ""Ray is a part of our family, and a part of this program, and that's why I'm very happy he's here today because, because he made a mistake,"" New Rochelle High School football head coach Louis DeRienzo said.

"Once upon a time, only clan chiefs could sleep at Tulloch Castle in the Scottish Highlands. Now it welcomes all, even a rumored resident ghost. With their hallowed hallways, romantic turrets and fairy-tale-like charms, castles have long intrigued travelers, especially Americans who have no such royal history stateside. Fortunately, you don't need a king's ransom: Our favorite European castle hotels start at $98 a night and many have hosted notable aristocrats. Switzerland's Wartegg Castle made a scenic lakeside refuge for the exiled Zita of Bourbon-Parma (Austria's last empress), while Belgium's Château d'Hassonville was the former hunting grounds of French enfant terrible Louis XIV. Rooms hark back to the 17th century with trappings like bronze busts, thick drapery, fireplaces and even complimentary carafes of port. Even scientists aren't immune to the magic of castles. Southern Sweden's Häckeberga Castle won over botanist Carl Linnaeus, who praised its flora and fauna. Look for ravens, white-tailed eagles and red deer in the beechwood forests along the region's new Linnaeus hiking trail -- just be back to the castle in time for a fresh seafood dinner. Without further ado, here's our list of affordable European castle hotels: . Parador de Oropesa, Spain . Legend has it that this 14th-century castillo in the foothills of the Sierra de Gredos was built on a site first settled in 1716 B.C. by Hercules's soldiers. Whatever its origins, Oropesa is undoubtedly one of Spain's oldest paradors. Forty-eight rooms are scattered with vintage tiles, colorful throw rugs, hand-painted canopy beds and Peruvian folk art imported by former resident Count of Oropesa, Francisco de Toledo, who served as the viceroy of Peru from 1569 to 1581. A swimming pool commands extensive views of the surrounding mountains, olive trees and the whitewashed medieval village of Oropesa, while the loggia-style terrace is a great place to linger over a creamy cod with salsa Antigua Monacal and glass of Rioja. parador.es/en; rooms from $125.

At a bend of the Rhine where Switzerland, Germany and France converge, this Alsatian member of the Small Luxury Hotel collection was the former royal residence of Dagobert II in the seventh-century Merovingian era. Now the castle hosts visitors in frilly Rococo-style rooms and encourages them to relax, whether by the outdoor swimming pool or in the Turkish bath and sauna (a few glasses of Alsatian wine from the 12th-century cellars also do nicely).

Dornröschenschloss Sababurg, Germany . The twin turrets of the enchanted, 675-year-old Dornröschenschloss (""Little Thorny Rose Castle"") rise from the surrounding ancient oak forest like an illustration in a fairy tale. It's only fitting as this castle is located on Germany's Fairy Tale Road and claims to be the inspiration of the Brothers Grimm's Legend of Sleeping Beauty, who some say slept here for a century before she was saved by a kiss. It's likely that the brothers did visit this castle, which was then in ruins. Today, a 17-room hotel occupies part of the castle, with canopied beds, cathedral ceilings, stone walls, and of course, extremely comfortable beds. sababurg.de; rooms from $120.

A 250-year-old wood-paneled great hall and trappings like oversize plaid headboards, large drafty fireplaces and a family and pet cemetery -- replete with overgrown scrub and an iron gate -- add to the haunted atmosphere. It's all a fitting tribute to the 20-bedroom castle's windswept Scottish Highland location. bespokehotels.com; rooms from $108. Wartegg Castle, St. Gallen, Switzerland .

"A Jasper, Texas, man has been indicted in connection with the death of Alfred Wright, a 28-year-old father of three whose mysterious disappearance and death sparked protests, controversy and allegations of a law enforcement cover up. Shane Hadnot, 28, who graduated with Wright from Jasper High School, has been charged with two counts of drug-related offenses that resulted in Wright's death. Hadnot, who pleaded not guilty during an initial appearance in federal court on Friday, has a detention hearing next week. He faces up to 20 years to life on each count, which allege that he supplied the fatal dose to Wright. Wright disappeared in rural Sabine County, Texas, on November 7, 2013. After authorities called off the search a few days later, a search party organized by his family found Wright's body on November 25, a few hundred feet from the original search command post. The condition, position and location of the body raised suspicion among family members and others in East Texas about what happened to this physically fit African-American man in an area known for having racial tensions after the 1998 dragging death of James Byrd Jr. Wright, a physical therapist who made house calls, had been treating patients when his pickup truck broke down near the CL&M liquor store. After calling his wife, Lauren, for help, and with his parents on the way, a clerk at the store said Wright tucked his cell phone in his sock and inexplicably took off on foot. The family had maintained Wright never used drugs. However, Friday's indictment contradicts that. In it, authorities allege that Lauren Wright, on the day her husband disappeared, told a deputy she hadn't observed anything unusual that day but called back and recanted her statement. She told the deputy that Wright had ""been acting very strange lately"" and that she ""suspected""  he was ""on something."" The indictment included a series of text messages between Wright and Hadnot, which authorities said show Wright bought cocaine, methamphetamine and Xanax from Hadnot on the day he died and regularly before that. Those three drugs were found in Wright's body. At the time the toxicology report came out, Alfred Wright's mother, Rosalyn Wright, said she believed the drugs were pumped into her son. A toxicology report prepared by a pathologist hired by the family, and obtained by CNN, also found an anabolic steroid in Wright's system. That report concurred with an official autopsy in finding Wright died of an accidental drug overdose. However, in the report, the pathologist, Dr. Lee Ann Grossberg stated, ""trauma cannot be definitively ruled out."" Both reports showed long-term cocaine use by Wright. In the indictment, authorities said Lauren Wright on November 11 taped a conversation with Hadnot in which he allegedly admitted to selling drugs to Wright on the day he disappeared. The indictment also discloses a text message sent by Wright to Hadnot that said: ""Bro 1 gino and a 20 and 3 handles,"" which the indictment translated to mean Wright was asking for a gram of cocaine, $20 worth of meth, and 3 Xanax pills. Wright was scheduled to see 10 patients on the day he disappeared. He only saw two. The second client told authorities Wright excused himself because he felt sick. The family has long stated that one of the failures of the investigation was authorities' neglecting to search. The indictment said authorities tried to search Wright's truck but were not given consent. It said the family searched the truck, found a business computer that was turned over to law enforcement and a personal computer that was not. When Wright's body was found, parts were missing and it had puncture wounds, authorities said. They concluded that was the result of animal scavenging activity and injuries from barbed wire. Lauren Wright did not respond to a request for comment. Alfred's sister Kassilia posted on Facebook that she did not support the U.S. attorney's indictment, saying: ""The true killers, slaughterers, lynchmen and henchmen are walking free! Mr. Hadnot is merely being used as a scapegoat in an extensive and meticulous ploy to mask the truth.""","Shane Hadnot charged with drug-related offenses that resulted in Wright's death .

"The horrendous ambush assassination of two Las Vegas police officers at a pizzeria and the killing of a good Samaritan by a violent young married couple with anti-government hatred again show that domestic extremists on the fringes remain a continuing threat in America. In fact, in recent weeks the Department of Justice reconstituted a law enforcement working group devoted to addressing right-wing extremism. One of Sunday's killers, who was reportedly removed by other militia protesters from the Bundy ranch standoff earlier this spring, draped an officer's body with a yellow Gadsden ""Don't Tread on Me Flag,"" a swastika and a note about ""revolution."" In the 1970s, a significant violent threat came from small, tight-knit groups of the ""revolutionary left"" such as the Weather Underground and Symbionese Liberation Army as well as the anti-police Black Liberation Army whose assassination sprees left 13 officers dead across the nation. Since the early 1980s, however, the domestic extremism threat pendulum has swung right, not only to white supremacists, but to anti-government ""Patriot"" adherents who sometimes, but not always, embrace hard-core racial prejudice and violence. Today, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, these groups number more than 1,000. The left-wing extremist groups of the 1970s operated as small, yet highly structured, segregated offshoots of the nonviolent civil rights and anti-war community. Unlike the more consistently planned bombings and premeditated assassinations of the 1970s left, right-wing violence today runs the gamut from Sunday's ambush to more spontaneous killings that follow car stops or police calls about relatively mundane disputes. In 2010, two West Memphis, Arkansas, police officers were killed by anti-government extremists during a routine car stop, and in 2009 three Pittsburgh officers died during a domestic disturbance call at the home of a gun-obsessed neo-Nazi. Today's violent right-wing extremists often operate on the fringes of existing groups or social networks, where they gain inspiration and a belief system in lieu of directives or an actual rank or ""membership"" card. While many of these favored groups are extremist, some are not. Jerad Milller, who police said carried out the Las Vegas attack with his wife, Amanda, reportedly went to the Bundy ranch militia protests and even posted a picture of a meeting he had with an extremist conspiracist on his Web page. He also used a flag popular with the right at the crime scene and ""liked"" various mainstream political groups such as the National Rifle Association, whose executive vice president called federal agents ""jack-booted thugs"" during the heyday of the 1990s militia movement, on his Facebook page. His posted manifesto  contains overheated versions of themes that could fit into a mainstream political speech, with its vow to fight tyranny. To be sure, mainstream groups in politics countenance reform, not murder, but the often-shrill rhetoric, conspiracy theories and innuendo they sometimes promote may have consequences. Alex Jones, a popular radio personality of the far right, went so far as to accuse the federal government of staging the Las Vegas incident for political gain. Members of law enforcement are among the most visible and active civic officials to interact directly with the public, so their symbolism and proximity make them targets for those who hate and loathe the government. Moreover, many police interactions involve emotionally tense situations, making law enforcement susceptible not only to premeditated violence but spontaneous attacks as well. Extremists, unlike political players, have opted out of accepting the peaceful processes and institutions of our pluralistic democracy. The Las Vegas killers had not only targeted officers as a tyrannical enemy but may have planned an attack on a courthouse as well. When we engage in political debate, we have to be mindful that the embers of dissatisfaction with government can fly and land on violent and sometimes unstable people who rely on conspiracy theories as an anesthetic for either personal failures or emotional frustrations.","Brian Levin: Las Vegas killings show anti-government extremists remain a threat .

"Saran Kaba Jones was just eight years old when she fled Liberia in 1989, escaping the horrors of a ruinous civil war that would plague the small West African nation for well over a decade. As the daughter of a diplomat, Jones went on to live a fairly privileged life abroad, following her family to countries like Ivory Coast, Egypt, France and Cyprus before moving to the United States to attend college. Meanwhile, back in Liberia, the country descended into a conflict that left an estimated 250,000 people dead and many more displaced, as well as destroying much of its economy and infrastructure. The fighting came to an end in 2003 and five years later Jones decided to pay a visit to Liberia. Returning home for the first time in nearly 20 years she encountered a wrecked nation that still bore the scars of years of conflict. ""When I got there I was absolutely shocked and devastated by what I was seeing,"" says Jones. ""It just wasn't the Liberia which I remembered as a young child -- things like basic necessities were non-existent: access to clean water, access to health care, access to basic education were non-existent and the challenges just seemed so enormous for the government."" Read this: Off-road bikers race to save lives in rural Africa . Witnessing her country's dire need for redevelopment was a life-changing moment for Jones. She immediately put aside her aspirations to follow in her father's footsteps pursuing a career as a diplomat. Instead, she decided that it was time for her to find a way of giving back to her country. One year later, Jones joined a number of state and private efforts to rebuild Liberia by setting up FACE Africa, a U.S.-based non-profit organization that's working to provide access to clean drinking water in Liberia's rural communities, where running water and sewage infrastructure is often a rare luxury. ""I decided to focus specifically on water because the issue of water really crosses all aspects of development,"" says Jones, 30. ""It affects education, it affects health, it affects gender issues, so for me there was nothing more basic than the issue of water so I decided to make that my cause."" FACE Africa, which relies on fundraising events and donations for its projects, focuses on implementing low-tech water solutions in the country's hard-to-reach rural areas, many of which had their major water points and systems destroyed during the war. So far the grassroots group has completed about 20 low-cost clean water, sanitation and hygiene projects, including hand dug wells, rehabilitation of existing wells and construction of communal latrines, that have benefited at least 7,000 people. Jones, who travels to Liberia every three months to oversee the group's projects, says that at least half of Liberia's 4 million population lack access to adequate drinking water. The desperate situation is exacting a huge toll on the country's society: approximately 3,000 people, more than half of which are children under the age of five, die each year from diarrhea due to poor water and sanitation conditions, according to World Bank figures. Read this: 'Western diseases' drive pharma boom in Africa . As well as saving lives, Jones says that access to safe drinking water can also encourage economic growth and improve the educational development of children, especially girls. ""This is the highlight of my work,"" says Jones, who was recently named by the World Economic Forum as one of its Young Global Leaders for 2013. ""Hearing from people who feel gratitude, mothers coming up to me saying that their children no longer suffer from diarrhea; they spend more time in school; girls don't have to walk miles every day to go and fetch water; men and women can now focus on more productive economic activities like farming and selling in the market."" In recent months, FACE Africa has embarked on a  major initiative that's aiming to solve the water crisis in River Cess, one of Liberia's most underserved areas, where only one fifth of its 80,000 population has access to adequate drinking water. Called ""County by County,"" the plan is to provide water coverage to 60,000 people in the region by building 250 water points by 2017 and to ensure that the country meets its Millennium Development Goals target of 250 people per safe water point. ""It's an ambitious goal for such a young organization like ours but we're absolutely confident that with the right focus and the right funding, if we're able to raise $1.2 million over this time, we can prove that with focus, with strategic implementation, we can solve the water crisis in River Cess."" 'Read this: Solar sisters' spreading light in Africa . Yet raising funds has always been a big challenge for FACE Africa, which faces stiff competition from bigger, more established NGOs eager to tap into donors' generosity. Jones says that limited funds affect the group's scaling capacity as well as its ability to have more people on the ground. FACE Africa employs two full-time staff, including Jones, and works with up to 30 volunteers annually. Despite all the challenges, Jones says she is determined to continue working to improve living conditions in her country. She says her long-term goal is to bring access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene to as many regions of Liberia as possible, as well as other post-conflict countries that face similar problems. ""If I can be known as the woman that helped solve the water crisis in Liberia and beyond,"" she says, ""if I can be a part of that solution, then for me I would have achieved success.""","Saran Kaba Jones is the founder of FACE Africa .

"Fighting erupted Friday across Egypt between supporters of Mohamed Morsy and their opponents, leaving more than two dozen people dead and hundreds more injured while raising fears of widening violence after the military ousted the country's first democratically elected president. The violence came as Morsy's supporters held massive protests across the country, calling for his reinstatement, a counter to huge demonstrations among those celebrating his ouster. At least 26 people were killed and more than 850 were injured in clashes across the country that at times pitted Morsy supporters against his opponents and the military, state-run media reported, citing the Ministry of Health and medical officials. Among those killed were five Morsy supporters who were shot by the army in front of the headquarters of the Republican Guard headquarters, where Morsy was said to be detained, the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing -- the Freedom and Justice Party -- said. The health ministry reported that at least two people were killed and 65 injured in clashes there. It did not detail the injuries that led to the deaths of the two. State broadcaster Nile TV, citing an unnamed security source, said live ammunition had not been used against demonstrators and no one was hurt or killed. The fighting broke out when Morsy supporters tried to storm the building, Nile TV said. CNN's Reza Sayah, reporting from outside the building, said he had seen one body around which scores of Morsy supporters were huddled, some of them crying. A few feet away, demonstrators faced off across a barbed-wire barricade behind which stood a line of soldiers who detonated flash grenades and fired tear gas in an apparent attempt to get the demonstrators to move away. Many of them did just that, though thousands of others remained in defiance. Demonstrators could be seen carrying away a wounded man. Some demonstrators waved flags and held pictures of Morsy and vowed not to leave until the military returns Morsy to office. By nightfall, clashes on a bridge near Tahrir Square began after a standoff that saw anti-Morsy demonstrators advance on his supporters, with both sides throwing rocks and shooting fireworks at each other as hundreds of people ran, according to video footage. About 100 soldiers, backed by armored personnel carriers, rolled on to the bridge to separate the two sides and break up the fighting. CNN's Ben Wedeman was reporting live near the bridge when soldiers unplugged his crew's camera and confiscated the equipment. Wedeman said an agreement subsequently was reached that the camera would be returned -- without the video footage. The violence was the latest fallout following Wednesday's move by the nation's powerful military to remove Morsy. Morsy had become the nation's first democratically elected president a year ago, but failed to fix the nation's ailing economy or improve its crime problems and was seen by many as increasingly autocratic. Anti-Morsy protesters eye next moves . Human Rights Watch has said he had continued abusive practices established by Hosni Mubarak, who was pushed out in a popular uprising in 2011 after three decades of iron rule supported by the U.S. government. ""Numerous journalists, political activists, and others were prosecuted on charges of 'insulting' officials or institutions and 'spreading false information,'"" the rights group said. Throngs of protesters filled Egyptian streets for days, calling for him to step down. The president's supporters turned out at massive counter demonstrations.  At times, the two sides  clashed with deadly consequences. On Monday, the army gave Morsy 48 hours to agree to share power or be pushed aside. On Wednesday, the military rejected Morsy's conciliatory gestures as insufficient and announced its ""road map"" to stability and new elections. Morsy and a number of leaders of the Brotherhood were arrested and may face charges over the deaths of protesters during clashes with Morsy's supporters, many of whom also died. Moves spark outrage . Adly Mansour, head of the country's Supreme Constitutional Court, was sworn in Thursday as interim president. Who is Egypt's Interim President? He immediately dissolved Egypt's upper house of parliament, the Shura Council, and appointed a new head of intelligence, state TV said Friday. The moves sparked outrage among Egyptians who saw them as counter to what their fledgling democracy was supposed to have been all about. Mohamed Badie, the Brotherhood's spiritual leader, exhorted the thousands of people who packed the area around the Rabaa Adawiya mosque in Cairo to fight back. ""The coup is illegal and we will never accept its results,"" said Badie, whose title is supreme guide of the Muslim Brotherhood. ""We sacrificed so dearly to reach this point, and we will never return to the past again."" Badie challenged the Egyptian army to ""return to the arms of the nation."" The furor appeared to escalate during the day. By nightfall, a car was burning on the 6th of October Bridge, which commemorates the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and leads to Tahrir Square, a focal point for anti-Morsy demonstrators. In Haram, a neighborhood of Giza in greater Cairo, one person was killed and seven were injured when a group of armed men attacked a police station, a spokesman for the health ministry said. At least 10 people were injured in clashes between supporters of Morsy and residents in the city of Damanhour, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) northwest of Cairo, Nile TV said. State television showed pictures from Alexandria of security forces firing tear gas at pro-Morsy demonstrators. Outside Cairo University, throngs of pro-Morsy demonstrators formed human chains while others participating in a sit-in shouted, ""Police are thugs!"" Mohamed Ismail was among those protesting near the university when he said he heard gunfire and saw ""thugs"" appear. They carried guns and knives, he told CNN. ""I saw scores of people falling from the gunshots,"" he said. ""But I do not know how many people were killed and injured."" Gunshots and birdshot were used in the clashes between the two sides, the state-run Al-Ahram news agency reported. Egypt's armed forces said they would guarantee the rights of protesters as long the protests resulted in neither violence nor destruction of property. Dismantling the Brotherhood? In a move likely to spark further unrest among Morsy supporters, Egyptian authorities arrested the Muslim Brotherhood's deputy supreme leader, Khairat el-Shater, and Salafi politician Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, on Friday in Cairo. Abu Ismail was being held on allegations of inciting the killing of protesters in front of the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Cairo, according to a statement released by the prosecutor's office. El-Shater, who was the Muslim Brotherhood's first presidential candidate before being replaced by eventual president Morsey, was being held in connection with accusations he incited the killing of protesters in recent days, state-run TV reported. The detention of the two men, who are wildly popular among their followers, has raised fears it could spur more supporters into the streets. Police, meanwhile, were seeking hundreds of other Brotherhood members, state media reported. A spokesman for the Freedom and Justice Party said Thursday the coup had turned into ""very, very questionable attempts by the military to dismantle the Brotherhood."" Opinion: Can the Muslim Brotherhood survive? The Freedom and Justice Party chief, Saad el-Katatni, and the party deputy, Rashad Al-Bayoumi, who were arrested Thursday, had been released, Nile TV, said Friday. The Tamarod, or ""Rebellion,"" movement, which had sought Morsy's ouster, has nominated Mohamed ElBaradei, an opposition leader, to become prime minister. ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, described Morsy's ouster as a ""correction of the uprising of 2011."" Other opposition leaders and protesters have objected to the use of ""coup"" to describe the military's removal of the elected president via non-democratic means. President Barack Obama said the United States was ""deeply concerned"" about the move, but did not use the word ""coup."" Washington has supplied Egypt's military with tens of billions of dollars in support and equipment for more than 30 years. Under U.S. law, that support could be cut off after a coup. The United States on Friday condemned the deadly violence following Morsy's ouster. ""We call on all Egyptian leaders to condemn the use of force and to prevent further violence among their supporters,"" State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said. ""As President Obama said, we expect the military to ensure that the rights of all Egyptians are protected, including the right to peaceful assembly, and we call on all who are protesting to do so peacefully."" Meanwhile, the African Union announced Friday that it suspended Egypt from its ranks of member countries. The AU's Peace and Security Council also said it was sending a team to Egypt to work toward restoring constitutional order. More violence, more deaths . Of the 22 people killed Friday, state-run media reported 12 died in clashes in the northern Egyptian city of Alexandria, where Morsy's supporters and opponents have reportedly clashed for days. Elsewhere, Islamist gunmen attacked Egyptian police stations and checkpoints in the Sinai, killing at least one soldier, agencies reported. A senior intelligence officer who would not agree to being identified said two police officers were killed in the northern Sinai city of Arish when a group of men drove by the police station and shot them. The assaults may have nothing to do with extremist threats to avenge Morsy's overthrow. The desert peninsula next to Israel and Gaza has long eluded the control of Egyptian security forces, leaving extremists plenty of room to establish themselves. The army said it was on high alert, a level below maximum alert, in the Sinai and Suez provinces. The military was enforcing a curfew until 6 a.m. local time Saturday in the northern Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is the largest Arab country in the world and a close ally of the United States, which gives it $1.5 billion per year for military and civilian programs. It controls the Suez Canal, a crucial sea route through which more than 4% of the world's oil and 8% of its seaborne trade travel. With Jordan, it is one of two Arab countries that has made peace with Israel.","At least 26 people were killed in post-coup violence, state media reports .

"(CNN) -- The 2014 World Cup in Brazil has shown the growing global interest in football, according to early broadcast figures released by the game's governing body FIFA . The first round of group matches have shattered TV viewing records worldwide and highlighted an increase in the amount of people watching football in countries that aren't known for their ardent fanaticism. Fans in countries such as the United States and Australia have tuned in in their millions to watch their national teams play in one of the biggest sporting events of the world. FIFA said the first-round game between the U.S. and Ghana brought in 11.1 million viewers on ESPN, a record high for its coverage of World Cup matches. The opening game of the tournament between Brazil and Croatia on June 12 had 42.9 million people watching on Brazilian network TV Globo, FIFA said, making it the most watched sporting event of the year. Italy's 1-0 win over England was seen by 14.2 million on BBC1 in the UK and 12.8 million on RAI 1, the highest TV audiences in both countries in 2014. Some 26.4 million in Germany watched Thomas Muller score a hat-trick in the 4-0 win over Portugal on the ARD channel, which FIFA said was the country's biggest 2014 TV sports audience. Japan's defeat by the Ivory Coast was seen by 34.1 million on Japanese channel NHK -- double that of its next biggest sports broadcast this year. Other viewing highs were achieved in Argentina, France, the Netherlands, Croatia and the French-speaking part of Belgium.

"There are two things you can be sure of when it comes to your taste buds in Morocco. You'll drink enough sugary mint tea to send your dentist into a spin. And, after a couple of days, you'll be sick to your back teeth of tagine (if you have any left). What's a hapless (and hungry) traveler to do? As most locals will tell you, the best Moroccan food is found at home, not in restaurants. Unless you can wrangle an invite to a local's home, your best bet is to dive into the maze-like medinas and head to the food souks. Vendors gather in guild-like fashion, so you'll find honey sellers in one area and a row of butchers down another alleyway. The best cities for street food include Fez (head toward the Achabine area), Marrakech (in Djemaa el-Fna and surrounding streets) and Essaouira (near the port end of Place Moulay Hassan). ""A lot of visitors miss out on street food because they go back to their hotel between 6 and 8 p.m. for dinner,"" says guide Gail Leonard, who runs food tours of Fez, the culinary capital of Morocco. ""This is when Moroccans promenade and snack, before dinner at home at around 10 p.m. ""It's also the time when you get to connect with Moroccans, because that's when they're out eating."" Street food is also popular for breakfast and lunch and draws on Morocco's mix of Berber, Arab and European cultures. Best of all, it's fresh, filling and yours for a few dirhams. Bread . Crusty bread (khobz) baked in communal wood-fired ovens is a Moroccan staple. The souks also serve an array of pan-fried, waistline-busting loaves. Particularly good is beghrir (spongy bread, a bit like crumpets), harsha (buttery bread made of fine semolina) and rghaif (flaky, layered flat bread). Topped with honey or goat cheese, they make a good snack while you're out exploring. Expect to pay from MAD 2-10 ($0.24-1.18), depending on the topping. Bessara . A bowl of hearty fava bean soup, mopped up with the ubiquitous khobz, is a popular workers' breakfast and costs just MAD 5 ($0.59). Hole-in-the-wall eateries also dish it up for lunch with a glug of lemon-infused olive oil and a sprinkle of cumin and chili. The soup is made with loads of garlic (about a kilogram per large vat) and the stallholder will simply shut up shop once he's sold out. Crumbed liver . Moroccan's are big on nose-to-tail eating. You can chow down on cow udders, tongues, tripe, even feet. Too adventurous? There's the Moroccan version of a wienerschnitzel: smooth and buttery calves' livers, crumbed and fried. Food in souks is sold by weight and a decent portion costs around MAD 10 ($1.18). The vendor will chop it up and serve it in a sandwich or with a handful of fries. Steamed sheep head . This delicacy is usually eaten for breakfast after a home slaughter during the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha (Feast of the Sacrifice). In the souk, sheep heads are steamed for about five hours and ready by lunchtime. ""They're sold as a half (MAD 15/$1.77) or whole head (MAD 30/$3.55), with or without eyes, although the brains are sold separately at another stall,"" says Gail. To eat a head, wait for the vendor to scrape off the fur. Then sprinkle it with cumin, salt and chili, and scrape out the tender cheek meat and tongue. Spicy sardines . Morocco is the world's largest exporter of sardines, making the little fish a street food staple. Sardines are stuffed with a spicy chermoula paste made of tomato, coriander, chili, garlic, paprika, cumin, olive oil and lemon juice. They're coated in a light batter, fried until crisp and often served with a fried green chili. Again, they're sold by weight, but MAD 15 ($1.77) will buy you a tasty sandwich. Aubergine fritters . Vegetarians can happily scoff their way through the souks, too, with plenty of fresh, organic produce for sale. Sliced aubergine dipped in sweet smoked paprika batter then deep-fried go for MAD 1 apiece ($0.12). The silky, smoky slices are served with spicy lubia (white haricot beans stewed in tomatoes, cumin, paprika, garlic and ginger) or fresh salad. Brochettes . Follow the billowing clouds of smoke and you'll find mini-chicken kebabs cooking over charcoal. The meat is rubbed with salt and spices, such as paprika and cumin. Spiced ground lamb or beef (kefta) is formed around a skewer and grilled. Brochettes are served with khobz, harissa (red pepper sauce), red onion, cumin and salt and cost around MAD 20-30 ($2.36-3.55). Snail soup . Stalls selling steaming vats of snail soup are popular across the country. A bowl costs between MAD 5-10 ($0.59-1.18). First you pluck the snails from their shells with a toothpick before slurping the soup. ""The snails have an earthy flavor, a bit like shitake mushrooms,"" says Gail. Flavored with a concoction of around 15 different spices, Moroccans believe the broth is good for digestion and fever, so some drink it without snails. Stuffed camel spleen . For an alternative take on sausage, how about tehal (stuffed camel spleen)? Stuffed with ground beef, lamb or camel meat, olives, spices and a little bit of hump fat, the spleen is sent off to be baked in a communal bread oven. It's sliced, griddled and served up in a sandwich (MAD 15/$1.77). The texture is soft and creamy, like liver, and tastes gamey. Or you can pop into Café Clock in Fez for one of their famous camel burgers served with fries and salad (MAD 95/$11.23); 7 Derb el Magana, Talaa Kbira; +212 535 637 855; www.cafeclock.com. Desserts . Super sweet pastries and biscuits are big in Morocco, especially during Ramadan, when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset. Each evening, they celebrate breaking their fast with succulent dates, pastries and savory harira (lentil and tomato soup). Some of the most irresistible (and calorific) goodies include briwat (deep fried filo pastry triangles stuffed with almonds) and shebakia (flower-shaped, fried sesame cookies). Both are dipped in honey and go for around MAD 1-3 each ($0.12-0.35).

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney suspended his bid for the Republican presidential nomination Thursday, saying if he continued it would ""forestall the launch of a national campaign and be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win."" ""In this time of war, I simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror. This is not an easy decision. I hate to lose,"" the former Massachusetts governor said. ""If this were only about me, I'd go on. But it's never been only about me. I entered this race because I love America, and because I love America, in this time of war I feel I have to now stand aside for our party and for our country."" Romney made the announcement Thursday afternoon at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. With Romney out, Sen. John McCain is locked in as the front-runner in the GOP race. Romney had won 286 delegates through the Super Tuesday contests, compared with McCain's 697. The crowd booed when Romney mentioned McCain, saying, ""I disagree with Sen. McCain on a number of issues.""  Watch as Romney bows out » . ""But I agree with him on doing whatever it takes to be successful in Iraq, on finding and executing Osama bin Laden, and I agree with him on eliminating al Qaeda and terror worldwide,"" he said. According to a senior McCain adviser, McCain called Romney and told him he ""admired his speech today and that he was a tough competitor."" McCain also told Romney he looks forward to sitting down with him at the earliest opportunity. McCain did not ask Romney for his endorsement. Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama viewed Romney as a more vulnerable candidate, preferring to run against him rather than McCain, CNN senior political correspondent Candy Crowley said. ""They were looking at Mitt Romney as pretty doable in the political sense saying, 'This is a guy that has a record that we can really run with' and they ran with it in the Republican Party as you know, saying that he used to be pro-choice, now he's anti-abortion. He has changed his position on stem cells, he has changed his position on gay unions, that sort of thing,"" she said. As recently as Wednesday, Romney met with aides to discuss strategy to stay in the race through March 4. Although he outspent his rivals, Romney received just 175 delegates on Super Tuesday, compared with at least 504 for McCain and 141 for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, according to CNN estimates. Romney came in first in Massachusetts, Alaska, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah on Super Tuesday. In the early voting contests, he won Nevada, Maine, Michigan and Wyoming. After his win in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, Huckabee became Romney's chief rival for the party's conservative vote. Huckabee on Tuesday won Arkansas, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama and West Virginia. Romney entered the race in early 2007 after finishing his single term as governor with the support of much of the GOP's conservative establishment. He had campaigned as the viable conservative alternative to McCain, who has infuriated much of the party's activist base over the years. But voters ""just didn't get a sense of him that gave enough of them enough confidence,"" said former education secretary and radio talk-show host Bill Bennett. ""A lot of people couldn't get comfortable with Romney for one reason or another -- changes in position; 'Why is he going this way? He's a businessman, why does he sound like he is a born-again Christian?' People were just not sure of what the message was,"" Bennett said. The 60-year-old former investment banker touted his management credentials throughout the campaign, citing his experience in Massachusetts and his turnaround of the scandal-plagued 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Despite pouring millions of his own fortune into the campaign, Romney struggled after Huckabee upset him in the Iowa caucuses and McCain came from behind to beat him in New Hampshire. ""Primaries are a killing field,"" said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider. ""They take losing candidates and get their bodies off the field."" Suspending a campaign has a different meaning depending on the party. On the Republican side, decisions on how to allocate delegates are left to the state parties. On the Democratic side, a candidate who ""suspends"" is technically still a candidate, so he or she keeps both district and statewide delegates won through primaries and caucuses. Superdelegates are always free to support any candidate at any time, whether the candidate drops out, suspends or stays in. National party rules say a candidate who ""drops out"" keeps any district-level delegates he or she has won so far but loses any statewide delegates he or she has won.  E-mail to a friend .

"Singapore's prime minister openly criticized the United States over the government shutdown and ongoing deadlock over the debt ceiling, calling them ""problems you have created for yourself in a game  of chicken."" In an interview with CNN's Patricia Wu on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Americans  ""are unable to get their act together,"" and that Washington's behavior sends a ""negative signal which will last much longer that the shutdown."" The government shutdown led U.S. President Barack Obama to cancel his attendance at the APEC Leaders' summit just days before he was meant to arrive.  The summit finishes today in Bali, Indonesia. Aside from Taiwan, Obama is the only leader missing among the 21 economies of the APEC group, which together account for half the world's output, 45% of its trade and 3 billion of its inhabitants. READ MORE: Obama APEC absence boon for Xi, Putin . The U.S. government is also facing an October 17 deadline to raise its debt ceiling or risk a possible default.

Asked if the U.S. would benefit from a system like Singapore's -- where government ministers are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in salaries -- Lee said he believes his country runs a clean system in which officials are paid ""what their job is worth."" He criticized the conflicts of interest that result from the ""revolving door"" between the United States government and the private sector.

Singapore is heavily dependent on exports and trade, so the fate of the city-state is closely linked with the health of the U.S. economy.

The prime minister said he is comfortable with Singapore's footing as the United Stated considers turning off the flow of easy money. ""The emerging economies, many of them are concerned. They didn't want the money to slosh in. They are afraid when the money sloshes out, but the tapering has to take place and we have to be able to manage it,"" Lee said.

"(CNN) -- South African athletics officials have rallied behind controversial new running star Caster Semenya, who won the women's world 800 meters title just hours after the sport's governing body asked for the 18-year-old's gender to be verified. Semenya celebrates her gold, which came just hours after the IAAF called for a gender test on the athlete. Semenya crushed her rivals by streaking away to secure victory in a time of one minute 55.45 seconds -- the best in the world this year and more than eight seconds quicker than her fastest effort of 2008. She finished more than two seconds clear of second-placed Kenyan Janeth Jepkosgei, the 2007 champion. However, the race was run amid controversy following the announcement by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF).   Have your say: What's your opinion on the IAAF's decision? Semenya's masculine build fueled rumors, but the South Africa team manager said there should be no dispute. ""Even the ID that she has, the passport, says she is a female,"" Phiwe Mlangeni-Tsholetsane told CNN by phone from Berlin on Thursday. ""There was no cheating on our part, or even on the part of the athlete."" She said Semenya was not bothered by the questions over her gender and was simply focusing on improving her times. ""If there are tests being done, we accept that. We can't stop that,"" Mlangeni-Tsholetsane said. ""We have nothing to hide."" Meanwhile, Semenya received her gold medal in the podium ceremony on Thursday, receiving a warm ovation from the crowd in the Berlin Olympic Stadium. Dressed in the yellow and green track suit of South Africa, Semenya mouthed the words of their national anthem as her country's flag was raised. Results from the IAAF's planned tests are not expected to be known in the near future. ""The gender verification test is an extremely complex procedure,"" said IAAF spokesman Nick Davies -- who revealed the question of Semenya's gender was first raised after her astonishing African Junior Championships displays. ""In the case of this athlete, following her breakthrough in the African Junior Championships, the rumors, the gossip were starting to build up,"" Davies told reporters. Semenya declined to take part in the scheduled post-race interview, reported South African tabloid Sowetan, and her place was taken by IAAF general secretary Pierre Weiss. ""The investigations will take some days or weeks and I'm not a doctor to give a conclusive answer on her gender. But we know her as a woman,"" Pierre said. Athletics South Africa president Leonard Chuene accused South African media of trying to ""destroy"" Semenya, according to Sowetan -- which described the runner as ""our golden girl."" ""They have their own agenda and I can tell you that they will not succeed,""  Chuene said. ""This girl has been to African youth championships and other international events, and why was this issue not raised then? ""Why now? Is it because she is not an athlete they were expecting to do well in her maiden appearance in the senior championships?"" Her father Jacob Semenya told the paper before the race that the accusations were unfounded. ""She is my little girl. I raised her and I have never doubted her gender. She is a woman and I can repeat that a million times,"" he said on Wednesday.","NEW: Caster Semenya receives gold medal in ceremony Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Questions abound about how to best inoculate the world against swine flu as health officials plan for a campaign that could dwarf any previous flu vaccination effort. Researchers in Taiwan sort through eggs for a swine flu vaccine. Companies worldwide are working on vaccines. Among the issues to be resolved are the amount of vaccine likely to be available, the timing of the vaccine's availability, how it would be distributed, who would provide the shots, who would pay for them and whether it will be possible to track potential side effects. At a recent meeting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health officials said U.S. demand could reach 600 million doses of vaccine, enough for two doses for each of the approximate 300 million people in the United States. That's in case two doses are required for children and adults under 50, CDC representatives said. That would come on top of the 115 million doses of seasonal flu that are distributed annually, health officials said Friday. Although there has been no official decision to undertake a major vaccination campaign, senior officials are hinting strongly that they would recommend such an effort. Congress passed a supplemental appropriation for $7.5 billion, which President Obama recently signed, to cover the costs of preparing for the virus, which includes a vaccination campaign, CDC spokesman Thomas Skinner said. Small studies in ferrets at the CDC suggest that when compared with seasonal flu, the virus appears to cause more severe disease but also seems to spread less easily. Ferrets are often used in flu research because the animal's respiratory tract responds to flu viruses in much the same way as a human's. Still, it's too soon to draw any conclusions, said Nancy Cox, director of the CDC's influenza division. More detailed results will be published in the journal Science this week. The World Health Organization declared the virus, also known as the novel influenza A(H1N1), a global pandemic June 11. More than 70 countries have reported cases of human infection with the virus, and more than 70,000 cases have been documented worldwide, according to the WHO. There are 27,717 cases in the United States, according to the CDC. As the first pandemic strain to emerge since 1968, the novel H1N1 virus has attracted interest from pharmaceutical companies around the world. Samples have been sent to dozens of potential vaccine makers, said Michael Shaw, lab team leader for the novel H1N1 response at the CDC. Most vaccine production will involve the traditional route of growing a modified virus in eggs, but demand is so high that newer methods are getting a serious look. One comes from a small company called Protein Sciences Corp., based in Meriden, Connecticut, which recently received a $35 million contract from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to pursue a new vaccine technology. ""The technology has advanced in recent years to a point that we believe it could help meet a surge in demand for U.S.-based vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu,"" HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement last week. The company is producing 100,000 doses of vaccine per week, said Daniel Adams, CEO of Protein Sciences Corp. The technology involves caterpillar ovary cells, which were isolated 20 years ago, and a virus called baculovirus that infects insects but does not harm humans, Adams said. Scientists inject a protein of the novel H1N1 virus into the baculovirus, which can multiply quickly in insect cells. Making large quantities of this vaccine is faster than with traditional production methods because the basic cells are able to be frozen and stored, the company said in a statement. Protein Sciences Corp. will have the vaccines ready for use in clinical trials in a month, Adams said. They will also be ready for human use if the FDA issues an emergency authorization to start distributing swine flu vaccines. ""We'll be paving the way for everybody, because the data that's generated in those trials will allow other people to get any idea of what it's going to take, how to make an effective vaccine,"" Adams said. But the researchers do not know what is the appropriate dose size for this vaccine or whether it should be given once or twice, he said. These are issues that may be resolved in clinical trials. A more established player in the vaccine arena is Sanofi Pasteur, which could have vaccines for the novel H1N1 virus available for clinical investigation in humans this summer, spokeswoman Donna Cary said. Supplies could become available to public health authorities in four to six months, and the FDA is reviewing the final clinical trial design, she said. Novartis AG, another large pharmaceutical company, announced June 12 that it had produced the first batch of H1N1 vaccine weeks ahead of expectations, using cell-based manufacturing technology. The company plans for clinical trials to start in July and expects licensure in the fall. Abroad, the United Kingdom's department of health has signed contracts with pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline and Baxter. The advance purchase agreement allows for up to 130 million doses, but there is flexibility in the contract, spokesman James Hotson said. The UK health department expects that 75 million doses will be produced before the end of the year, with the first supplies arriving in August, Hotson said. GlaxoSmithKline spokesman Jeff McLaughlin said his company's first doses are expected to be available in four to six months. Baxter has just gone into full-scale production of its novel H1N1 vaccine and is hoping to deliver it for clinical trials as early as July, said Kim White, spokesperson for the company. The clinical work for this vaccine is based on the H5N1 avian flu, she said. ""The clinical trials [part] is a little tricky, given that this is a brand new virus,"" she said. ""No one has done clinical trials with this particular virus."" In planning, U.S. health officials are taking into account the experience of the 1976 swine flu vaccine campaign, which strove to immunize against the strain found at Fort Dix, New Jersey. More than 40 million people received the vaccine before the campaign ended because some recipients developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes temporary paralysis. There's still no good working theory on what caused it, Cox said. Comparisons between the two episodes are limited in value, she said, because genetic analysis shows that the current H1N1 virus is very different from the 1976 swine flu virus. CNN's Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report.","115 million doses of seasonal flu are distributed annually in U.S.

"(CNN) -- Anna Hazare, the 74-year-old Indian activist set to begin a 15-day hunger strike at a public venue, delivered a message Thursday to the thousands who have taken to the streets in support of his anti-corruption crusade. ""Your revolution has energized me,"" he said in a YouTube video posted by his adviser, Kiran Bedi. Speaking from Tihar jail in which he was staying -- though he was not a prisoner -- he added, ""I will stay here tonight and will be out with you tomorrow."" ""My health is good. In fact, I am more alert than ever. We will not stop until we get this Lokpal bill,"" he said, referring to the anti-corruption body that protesters want set up. And he warned his strike could go on longer. ""They've given me 15 days, but if the Lokpal is not established, I will extend my fast by another seven days."" He added, ""The people out on the streets are finding it difficult to live because of the corruption. The public will continue to be on the streets as long as this Lokpal isn't created."" Bedi, a former police adviser, wrote in a tweet posting a link to the video, ""It was destiny doing this. Share. Anna is ours."" She added, ""Jai hind"" -- long live India. Hazare was planning to go on a hunger strike to call for stronger anti-corruption measures when he was detained Tuesday. As thousands took to the streets to protest the arrest, authorities let him free, but he refused to leave the jail. He accepted a police proposal that will allow him to fast in New Delhi for two weeks. The site chosen is Ramlila Maidan, a public ground that often stages exhibitions and events. He plans to arrive at the grounds Friday. Hazare only recently rose to national prominence, as his protest seems to have struck a chord with Indian society across the spectrum because corruption is pervasive at all levels of government, observers say. A new website ipaidabribe.com, in which people can denounce the corruption they encounter in their daily lives, quickly gained popularity. Hazare's detention appears to have added to his popularity, because it makes it look like the government is going after the messenger rather than offering solutions. Corruption is considered an endemic problem that affects all levels of Indian society. According to a 2010 Transparency International report, India ranked 87th out of 178 countries in its corruption-perception index. In April, Suresh Kalmadi, the chief organizer for last year's Commonwealth Games, was arrested and accused of buying a time, scoring and result system from a Swiss company at inflated costs. India's former telecom minister A. Raja, several bureaucrats and corporate officials are facing trial in connection with a multi-billion-dollar scandal involving the suspected below-price sale of mobile-phone radio waves in 2008. The draw of Hazare's planned hunger strike was so great that police tried to put conditions on it. Organizers did not accept six of 22 police conditions for allowing the protest, including limiting the crowd to the capacity of the ground, police said. As a result, Hazare was detained, as were 1,300 supporters who planned to join Hazare at a protest site. A magistrate sent Hazare and seven supporters to jail after they failed to post bail, according to Rajan Bhagat, a police spokesman in New Delhi. They were freed hours later and brought to a prison office after the magistrate issued release orders, jail spokesman Sunil Gupta said. The group had refused to leave the prison office until they are allowed to hold their hunger strike without the conditions, the jail spokesman said. Thousands gathered in several cities, chanting pro-Hazare slogans and echoing his demands. Supporters carrying Indian flags held sit-ins, marches and noisy demonstrations. Many had ""I am Anna"" labels on their shirts. Hazare conducted a similar five-day hunger strike in April at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar landmark, ending it after India's prime minister agreed to introduce long-pending legislation. Anti-corruption campaigners have rejected legislation prepared by the federal government to create a citizen ombudsman, saying the bill, now in Parliament, is too weak a measure. Critics have accused the activists of undermining lawmakers who will decide the proposed law. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday justified the arrests in a statement before Parliament. ""Our government acknowledges the right of citizens to hold peaceful protests,"" he said, adding that Hazare and his supporters would have been allowed to hold their protest fast if they had accepted the conditions. Amid shouts by opposition lawmakers over the police response to Hazare's protest, the Indian prime minister also cited supremacy of the legislature. ""I am not aware of any constitutional philosophy or principle that allows anyone to question the sole prerogative of parliament to make a law,"" he said. Singh, whose government is roiled in massive corruption scandals, said in a national address earlier in the week that no single measure could handle chronic corruption. ""I believe that there is no single big step which we can take to eradicate corruption. In fact, we will have to act simultaneously on many fronts,"" Singh said. Amnesty International called Thursday for U.S. President Barack Obama to urge Singh ""to respect the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly in the context of anti-corruption rallies taking place in India."" ""President Obama has repeatedly described India as a strong ally,"" the human rights group said in a statement, adding that Obama ""should not miss this opportunity to prove that the United States is a friend of the Indian people."" ""Any silence will be misinterpreted as the United States looking the other way when it comes to the importance of basic rights like freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in India. President Obama should instruct the U.S. ambassador to India to visit protest sites."" Activists have appealed to government employees to take a day off work in a show of solidarity with Hazare. In his video, Hazare warned that more arrests could lie ahead. ""The jails that are empty, we will keep filling them,"" he said. ""I tell these young people: As long as the Lokpal isn't created, the jails will never be empty."" ""We have no demands of the government,"" he said. ""We have just sent them to do two things: look after our money and account for it and make good laws for the country."" He insisted the Lokpal bill would reduce corruption by 65 to 70 percent. ""I will not stop, as long as there's breath in my body, until this becomes law,"" Hazare said.","Hazare's YouTube video warns he may extend fast another week .

"Hard questions are being raised about the Taliban in Afghanistan now that the United States will formally meet with the erstwhile al Qaeda ally. Why is the U.S. government engaging the hard-line Islamic fundamentalist group, a regime that once sheltered Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network and was eventually routed out of Afghanistan by a U.S. invasion after the September 11, 2001, attacks? Such tough questions were unleashed shortly after the announcement about upcoming U.S.-Taliban talks during a Tuesday news conference held by State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. She was asked point-blank: ""In the eyes of the U.S., is Taliban a terrorist group?"" Responded Psaki: ""Well, I'm not sure how they're defined at this particular moment."" To be fair, Psaki described the U.S. peace talks with the Taliban -- which Afghan President Hamid Karzai opposes -- as the preliminary step toward long healing process in war-torn Afghanistan and creating ""reconciliation"" within the country. At their office in Doha, Taliban make changes . In the meantime, many details remain to be worked out about the Taliban, Psaki said. On Wednesday, Psaki dismissed reports that the first meeting had been scheduled for Thursday and said a date hasn't been set. ""The important thing here is that we've long said that moving toward a reconciliation process, of which they are a key part -- the president has said this, the secretary (of state) has said this -- is an important part of moving towards a more stable Afghanistan. That's why we support these efforts,"" Psaki said. ""That's why we've been so engaged, why the secretary has been so engaged, at every level of the government."" What has influenced U.S. leaders is the Taliban's announcement that they oppose ""the use of Afghan soil to threaten other countries"" such as the United States and they support an Afghan peace process, Psaki said. To advance peace, the Taliban has chosen, Doha, Qatar, to open an office under the name ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan."" On Tuesday, the Taliban told reporters it wanted to improve its international relations. The Taliban announcement has angered the Afghan president, who said the country's High Peace Council won't take part in peace talks in Qatar until the process is led by Afghans. In Kabul, Karzai met with politicians and members of the High Peace Council on Wednesday to talk about the Taliban office in Qatar. Why Taliban would talk as U.S. withdrawal looms . In a statement, Karzai said his country wants peace, ""but the messages of continuation of fighting, which were sent out during the opening of the Taliban office in Qatar, are completely in contradiction with the peace-wanting spirit of the government of Afghanistan."" Karzai was referring to how, during Tuesday's ribbon-cutting in Qatar, a Taliban spokesman said the group would continue its military campaign while at the same time renouncing international terrorism. Seeming to make good on its military pledge, the Taliban later Tuesday claimed responsibility for the attack inside the Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan that killed four U.S. soldiers. Karzai criticized the Taliban's promise about military advances. ""This shows that the continuation of such policies of the Taliban are for ... foreigners' strategies and goals,"" Karzai's statement said. He charged that ""foreign powers"" are behind the opening of the Taliban's office in Qatar. U.S. officials, however, view the Taliban office as a good start -- ""good news,"" in fact. ""We've long said that this conflict will likely not be won on the battlefield, and that is why we support this office,"" Psaki said. The ability to open a formal line of communication with the Taliban is important to reaching an ""end goal"" of disassociating the Taliban from al Qaeda and bringing peace to Afghanistan, Psaki said. Psaki asserted that the rights of women -- protected under the Afghan constitution -- are not open for negotiation with the Taliban, which has oppressed and mistreated women. ""It's not up for negotiation,"" Psaki said of the rights of Afghan women and minorities. ""That is the end goal of the process of reconciliation. This is a first step in the process. I'm not overestimating or overstating what it means, but certainly, a first step is one farther step than we had just a few days ago."" What to know about the proposed talks . Psaki reiterated the ""beginning of the process"" theme -- even when asked whether the U.S. government now considers the Taliban ""a legitimate fighting group"" as opposed to ""enemy combatants."" ""Our goal in Afghanistan continues to be to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda to ensure that the country can never again be a safe haven for terrorists. We're doing both at the same time, talking and winding down our fighting in the country,"" Psaki said. But what about the several Taliban leaders who are on a most-wanted list? Will the United States delist them as the Taliban has sought? ""This is just the first step in the process. There is a journey to go here,"" Psaki said. ""So it's significant because we are taking a step in the process, but there need to be negotiations, there need to be discussions."" U.S. forces in Afghanistan now stand at about 66,000 but are expected to fall to 32,000 by the end of the year, and there will be even fewer in 2014. Gen. John Allen, the former commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, recommended a level between 6,000 and 15,000 troops, but the Pentagon has cut the proposed figure further, to between 2,500 and 9,000, according to a defense official. That U.S. withdrawal raises the stakes for Afghanistan to govern itself in peace.","Peace talks between U.S. and Taliban are ""a first step in the process"" of reconciliation .

"We're used to seeing manufacturer tags that read ""Made in the USA,"" ""Made in Taiwan"" or ""Made in..."" just about anywhere on the globe.  But this week, for the first time, an item can read ""Made in Space."" The International Space Station's 3-D printer created the first object to be made in orbit on Tuesday.  The U.S. space agency released a picture of astronaut Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore holding the newly printed piece, a white printer part emblazoned with the words ""Made in Space"" and ""NASA."" It's not just a novelty. ""There are many challenges about living and working in space, including when a part or a tool is broken or simply is not working correctly, and the spare part is 200 miles away, here on the surface of the Earth,"" said Bill Hubscher of NASA's ISS Program Science Office at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, in a video posted on NASA.gov. ""Explorers traveling to Mars or to asteroids will face these same challenges,"" but they won't be able to get goods from a resupply ship, he said. NASA's International Space Station 3-D printer project manager Niki Werkheiser says it's a historic achievement because it allows engineers ""to e-mail our hardware to space instead of launching it."" Humans on Mars by 2035? NASA's sci-fi dream could be reality . ""Since the inception of the human space program, we have been completely dependent on launching every single thing we need from Earth to space,"" said Werkheiser in the video. 3-D printers work by applying layer upon layer of heated plastic.  But how do pieces made in space compare with those made on Earth?  Do the layers bond differently without Earth's gravity?  That's a question scientists hope to answer next year when the samples are returned to Earth on a SpaceX Dragon capsule. Before the 3-D printer flew to the space lab in September, the team printed a complete set of sample items here on Earth to be used as ground control samples.  It'll be an ""apples-to-apples comparison,"" said NASA's Werkheiser. ""Made in Space"" isn't just the printer faceplate's manufacturing location. It's the name of the California-based company that designed and built the space station's 3-D printer with NASA's guidance, and it was Made in Space engineers on the ground who commanded the printer for this week's demonstration of 3-D printing prowess in microgravity.","International Space Station's 3-D printer has created the first object to be made in orbit .

"The Krystall hotel will doubtless inspire a few gags about a frosty reception when it opens in December 2016, but once guests realize they're about to check in to a giant floating snowflake, it could just as easily melt hearts. The 86-room luxury venue has been designed by architecture firm Dutch Docklands for the Norwegian city of Tromso, offering clients a unique destination and an unrivaled spot from which to view the northern lights. ""We call it a scar-less development,"" architect Koen Olthuis tells CNN, explaining why the five-star Krystall will sit in icy waters off Tromso's rugged coastline rather than on dry land. ""Because it's floating, we do not have any impact on that location. If you take it away after 100 years or so, it will not leave any footprint. ""That's the only way to bring a hotel to such a precious and beautiful marine environment."" Olthuis says the Krystall has been inspired by the floating architecture widely found in his low-lying Dutch homeland, but will be on a far grander, and more opulent scale that is hoped will attract wealthy visitors from Japan, Russia and other parts of Europe. ""In the hotel, you'll float through hallways lined with cool, futuristic blue shapes, recline by a fireplace faced in transparent bricks resembling ice blocks and sleep in rooms tricked out in minimalist, winter-themed designs,"" he adds. Floating real estate . The Krystall's best features, however, are the glass roofs that will offer clear views of the northern lights and windows that will gaze over the snowy tree-lined Norwegian coast. Because it's out at sea and not moored to the land, the hotel will only be accessible by boat, but the architect promises it won't be affected by high winds and waves thanks to ""dampers, springs and cables."" ""The floating basis is very big and because of that also very stable. You will not notice any movement. This hotel is floating real estate and will not move,"" Olthuis says. ""It'll have the same look and feel as a land-based hotel, but on the most beautiful spot on the water."" The cost of building such a structure isn't disclosed, though put at 15% higher than for an equivalent hotel on dry land. The Krystall's dry dock construction was, in fact, first planned a few years ago, but put on ice (of course) until 2015 because of the global financial downturn. In the meantime, Dutch Docklands has begun work on a separate development in the Maldives. Ocean Flower, a complex of 185 floating villas in a flower-shaped configuration, is already being built near the islands' capital Male. Rising water levels . Greenstar, another planned development for the Maldives, involves building a floating hotel in the shape of star. A further project involving floating private islands off Miami has also recently been announced. Though his company's hotels are designed for the luxury leisure market, they form a wider portfolio of work intended to address a more down to earth concern -- climate change. With the effects of rising water levels that scientists have blamed on global warming already being felt in Maldives and Miami, Olthuis says we need to learn to live with the water, not just fight it. It's an approach that has already drawn criticism from some environmentalists who say that we should be tackling the causes of global warming rather than taking to the seas to avoid its affects. Olthuis is convinced of the need for his approach. ""I see around me the first signs of a new generation of climate change architects who do not only want to provide icons but also solutions,"" he adds. ""We live in a dynamic world where static buildings do not bring us the needed flexibility. ""Building on water brings us new space for expansion, safety against floods and flexibility to adjust developments without demolition whenever needed.""","Krystall hotel scheduled to open off the coast of Norway in 2016 .

"(CNN) -- Iran's vital oil industry appears to be the latest front in a power struggle between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei -- a fight that overseas analysts say the colorful president appears to be losing. Ahmadinejad is trying to retain control of Iran's Oil Ministry despite a ruling by the country's top judicial body that he can't serve as its acting chief. It's the latest in a series of unusually public squabbles between Ahmadinejad and allies of Khamenei, the Islamic republic's clerical leader, in recent weeks. Khamenei backed Ahmadinejad through the tumult that followed his hotly disputed 2009 re-election, urging Iranians to accept the results of the balloting when protesters in the streets declared it a fraud. He presided over a crackdown on the demonstrations, during which security forces were unleashed on crowds and activists were prosecuted and jailed. But elements throughout the government have moved to check Ahmadinejad's efforts to replace top officials and have gone after the president's closest advisers, U.S. analyst Alireza Nader told CNN. ""I think it's a symptom of the general dissatisfaction with President Ahmadinejad that his powers and movement are being curtailed by the various power centers in Iran,"" said Nader, an expert on Iranian politics at the RAND Corp., an American think tank. The outspoken Ahmadinejad has long been a lightning rod for Iran's critics. But Haleh Esfandiari, director of Middle Eastern studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, said he may be left a ""lame duck"" after butting heads with Khamenei. ""I think Ahmadinejad underestimated the power of Khamenei, and he overestimated his own power,"" said Esfandiari, who was jailed for more than three months in 2007 during a visit to Iran. ""You can step on anybody's toes, but not on his toe."" Top officials and media outlets close to Khamenei have mounted a campaign of criticism targeting Ahmadinejad since mid-April, when Ahmadinejad tried to fire Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi. When Khamenei vetoed the move, Ahmadinejad retreated from the public eye, skipping Cabinet meetings. Esfandiari said Ahmadinejad appears to have violated one of Khamenei's cardinal principles for Iran's leadership: Settle your differences in private. ""Khamenei all along has been trying to give the impression that the ruling class speaks with one voice, that there is unanimity among them,"" she said. In early May, Ahmadinejad publicly swore allegiance to Khamenei and stressed his dedication to the principle of Velayat-e-Faqih, or Guardianship of the Supreme Jurisprudence, which forms the bedrock of Iran's Shiite theocratic rule. But on May 16, Ahmadinejad declared himself the caretaker head of the Oil Ministry as part of an attempt to consolidate Cabinet agencies. That would put him in direct control of the world's third-largest oil reserves, the bedrock of the country's economy. But the leaders of Iran's parliament protested, and the Guardian Council -- Iran's top judicial body, dominated by Khamenei's allies -- ruled last week that Ahmadinejad can't act as the caretaker minister. Wednesday, the head of the parliament's Energy Commission blamed Ahmadinejad for an explosion and fire at Iran's flagship oil refinery at Abadan that injured six people. The blast occurred when Ahmadinejad was visiting to attend the inauguration of a new unit at the facility, lawmaker Hamid Reza Katouzian said in comments carried by the Mashregh news agency. ""Some of the refinery's managers have said that it happened because they hurried the process of completion of the project,"" Katouzian said. He said those hurt ""were sacrificed because of certain disagreements and the unnecessary insistence to leave the Oil Ministry without a caretaker."" Meanwhile, Iranian news agencies reported that Ahmadinejad's palace prayer leader, Abbas Amirifar, faces charges of ""sorcery"" after producing a controversial film predicting the imminent return of the Mehdi, a messianic prediction that Ahmadinejad often refers to in his speeches. Public criticism also has been focused on his brother-in-law and chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, whom Ahmadinejad appeared to have been grooming as a successor. Some of Ahmadinejad's moves appeared calculated to remain influential beyond the end of his term in 2013, Nader said. But he said Ahmadinejad made ""a critical mistake"" by firing Moslehi without consulting the supreme leader, and by skipping Cabinet sessions after Khamenei reinstated him. ""It's pretty incredible how much power and influence he's lost in the last few weeks,"" Nader said, adding, ""I think it shows that he's not as powerful and consequential as he and a lot of people would like to assume."" Nader and Esfandiari said Ahmadinejad is unlikely to be forced from office -- something Nader said would amount to an admission of a mistake by Khamenei. ""The best outcome for the president is to serve his term, keep relatively quiet, stop being provocative and making decisions on his own,"" Nader said. And Esfandiari said Khamenei, who has ruled Iran since 1989, has made it clear to observers inside and outside Iran just who is in charge. ""This is just the beginning,"" she said. ""This is a story that will be unfolding over the next six months or year or so."" CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","Iran's outspoken president has butted heads with the country's clerical leader .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The U.S. soldier who authorities say killed five fellow troops -- including a Navy commander -- at a stress clinic in Iraq on Monday apparently used a weapon he wrested away from another soldier, a Defense official said. The Camp Liberty shooter has been identified as Army Sgt. John M. Russell of Sherman, Texas. After getting the weapon, the soldier stole a military vehicle and drove to the clinic, where earlier he had been in a fight, the official said. The shooter was identified as Army Sgt. John M. Russell, according to Maj. Gen. David Perkins, the military spokesman who briefed reporters in Baghdad, Iraq, on Tuesday. Russell has been charged with five counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault after the shooting at Camp Liberty, near Baghdad's international airport, Perkins added.  Watch how the Army is handling the case » . A 44-year-old communications specialist from Sherman, Texas, Russell is serving his third tour in Iraq and has previously deployed to Bosnia and Kosovo, according to his service record. His father, Wilburn Russell, also of Sherman, said Russell had e-mailed his wife saying he believed unidentified officers were trying to run him out of the military. ""As far as he was concerned, the military was the most wonderful thing that ever happened to him,"" Wilburn Russell said. ""Evidently, he felt they turned against him and life was over. He didn't care any more, I guess. ""He broke. He just couldn't handle it."" Russell had recently been referred to counseling by his commander because of unspecified words and actions, Perkins said. The commander also ordered that the sergeant's weapon be taken away. Among those killed in the shooting was Navy Cmdr. Charles Springle, 52, of Wilmington, North Carolina. Springle was part of the 55th Medical Company, stationed at Camp Liberty. The military had not released the names of the other victims Tuesday afternoon, pending notification of their families. A senior Defense official told CNN that when Russell was leaving the clinic Monday, he ""became hostile and an altercation broke out."" He was then escorted back to his quarters by another soldier, said the official, who has read the most recent summary of the investigation in Baghdad. A couple of hours later, Russell seized a weapon from a fellow soldier, ""commandeered"" a vehicle and drove back to the clinic, the Defense official said. A soldier from Russell's quarters called military police, but they weren't able to stop him in time. A summary of the investigation earlier Tuesday had suggested Russell took the weapon from his escort -- but that was unclear in the most recent report. The escort typically would have been a buddy, someone from Russell's unit, the Defense official said. Such steps are handled within the unit, and with the suicides of other troops they would have wanted someone close to keep an eye on him: ""Keep your buddy close."" The aggravated assault charge is for the struggle for the weapon in the vehicle, another Defense official said. Russell is from the 54th Engineering Battalion, based out of Bamberg, Germany -- a unit attached to Multi-National Division South but based at Camp Victory in Baghdad. He's now in military police custody at Camp Victory. The 54th's 15-month deployment began in May 2008; the battalion is due to leave Iraq in August. Perkins said the military has launched a criminal investigation into the attack and another probe to explore the military's mental health services operations and how such an incident can be avoided in the future. Among the five killed, two are officers from the staff of the clinic -- one from the Army and the other from the Navy. Both are from the 55th Medical Company. The other three were enlisted soldiers who happened to be at the clinic. Perkins, who said there are no immediate insights on a motive, said Russell had been receiving counseling within his battalion. Last week, Russell was referred to the Camp Liberty center. ""He had been seen by his chain of command, chaplain, things like that for about the week prior to (the incident), but that could have been the first time he physically had gone to the clinic,"" Perkins said. ""He was referred to counseling the week before and his commander determined that it was best for him not to have a weapon,"" he explained.  Watch how the shootings have raised the issue of post-traumatic stress disorder » . Perkins could not confirm any sequence of events and said the investigation into the incident is ongoing. ""Speculation does not serve us well, or rumor,"" he said. ""We need to know the facts because we will spend a lot of time trying to prevent these types of things in the future."" The clinic is temporarily closed for the investigation, with alternate locations available, Perkins said. Russell was apprehended outside the clinic after the shots were heard, Perkins said. Maj. Gen. Daniel Bolger, the commander of Multi-National Division-Baghdad, also spoke to reporters, telling them that a ""tragedy like this"" points to the ""challenges"" troops face. ""When something like this happens we've got to be careful not to judge too harshly and extend a sympathy that is due to all these soldiers and families,"" he said. Bolger said there is a ""stigma"" to mental health issues. ""Not all injuries are physical, and so you've got to have that door open for the guys, and that is one of the things we emphasize in our training. And, it's particularly challenging for a fellow like Sgt. Russell. ""He is a non-commissioned officer. ... He is in a leadership capacity. And to make that trip down there is a tough decision for either him or his chain of command to make, but we are willing to make it and we have had those facilities and care available."" Wilburn Russell said he hopes his son is found to be temporarily insane. ""We're devastated,"" he said. ""We're heartsick, not just for our son, but for the people that are involved -- the people that got killed and their families. ""My gosh, it's a horrible thing. It's impacted hundreds of people."" CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Mike Mount, Chris Lawrence, Barbara Starr, Cal Perry and Ed Lavendera contributed to this report .","NEW: Suspect struggled with fellow soldier over weapon, defense official says .

"On Christmas Day last year, Alan Henning was sitting in a brightly lit cafe in southern Turkey, sharing a laugh with his friends before they set off on their journey. Henning, a big-hearted taxi driver from Bolton, northern England, was part of a team of volunteers traveling from Britain to Syria to deliver aid to people in need. Nicknamed ""Gadget"" by his peers, Henning was the only non-Muslim in the convoy. He sacrificed Christmas, weekends and family time to do his part for those worst hit by Syria's civil war, and was admired by his fellow volunteers. This was the father-of-two's fourth trip to the war-torn country. While part of the aid convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning was part of a much smaller group that volunteered to press ahead into Syria itself. In video shot on the day, he explained part of his rationale for answering the call to help. ""It's all worthwhile when you see what is needed actually gets where it needs to go,"" he said, before hugging a colleague. Henning was kidnapped by ISIS a day after the video was made. He is now under threat of imminent execution. As the clock ticks down, those who made the trip with him are pleading with the leaders of the militant group -- which has declared an independent Islamic state across parts of Syria and Iraq -- to let Henning go. ""Alan was moved by the suffering of the Syrian people, in particular the children,"" Abu Abdullah said in a YouTube plea to his colleague's captors. ""Please do not take his life to pay for the crimes that the international governments have committed."" On Thursday, more than 100 British Muslim imams and organizations condemned ISIS' tactics and joined the call for Henning to be released. The coalition of Muslim communities is appealing to ISIS and the people around them to persuade the militants to change their ways, according to Mustafa Field, Director of Faiths Forum for London, one of the signatory organizations to the petition. ""The un-Islamic fanatics are not acting as Muslims but, as the Prime Minister has said, they're acting as monsters,"" he told CNN. ""They are perpetrating the worst crimes against humanity -- this is not jihad."" Field also had a direct message for the black-clad ISIS executioner known as ""Jihadi John"" -- the man with the London accent who featured in the group's gruesome videos of the beheadings of Western hostages James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and David Haines. ""John, we as Muslims are here to preserve lives,"" Field told CNN. ""We cannot continue this barbaric action. Come back, face justice, and repent."" Those who travelled with Henning to Syria have steered clear of tough talk, adopting a softer tone in addressing the jihadists holding their friend. ""We beg you to tread the path of justice and show him the compassion in the heart of believers and in your heart,"" Abu Abdullah said. ""We promised Alan safety and security as Muslims and ask you, the leader of Islamic State, to honor our 'amana' [bond of trust]."" Meanwhile, British Muslim community leaders have sought to distance mainstream Muslims from extremists, launching a social media campaign under the hashtag #notinmyname. Hanif Qadir -- director of the anti-extremism charity Active Change Foundation in east London -- and local youngsters have added their voices to the anti-ISIS drive. ""Young British Muslims are sick and tired of the hate-filled propaganda the terrorists ISIS and their supporters churn out on social media,"" Qadir said. ""They are angry that the criminals are using the platforms to radicalise young people and spread their poisonous words of violence in the name of Islam."" Regardless of the differences in tone, everyone appealing to ISIS to free Henning agrees on one thing -- the cabbie with the heart of gold cannot be left to die.

"I celebrate Halloween by dimming the lights and cuddling with my dog Lulu as Charlie Brown's pal Linus waits in vain for the Great Pumpkin on TV. Like poor Linus, we are part of a shrinking minority. The National Retail Federation estimates that consumers will spend a record $8 billion on Halloween festivities this year. That's a lot of Whoppers, M&Ms and Snickers bars. Pet owners will spend a whopping $370 million on costumes for the pets alone. If you plan to dress up your pet for Halloween this year, follow these tips to avoid a night filled with horror stories. 1. Buying a costume? Don't force the issue. Some pets love the attention they get from wearing clothes or costumes. Others express their contempt in clear and concise ways. If your pet hates donning costumes, grab a quick photo and set them free. Otherwise, you will spend the evening watching them shake off those devil ears. As Linus says, there's always next year. 2. Practice walking in the costume. Give pets time to get acclimated to their costume (and yours) before the big day. Make sure nothing impairs their mobility or vision. You may need to cut wider eye holes on Batman masks or trim the cape of that Superdog costume so pups don't trip. Also, be sure that your pet's collar and leash fit comfortably. 3. Make sure pet tags are up to date. Even the most mild-mannered dog may get spooked by the arrival of ghosts and goblins. No costume should be complete without a collar that includes updated ID tags. Related on MNN: Top 10 Halloween costumes for pets . 4. Practice basic obedience commands. Ghoulish surprises may be hiding behind every corner. Work on basic commands such as ""sit,"" ""stay,"" and especially ""leave it."" Make sure your pet understands that these rules apply indoors and outdoors. Bring high-value pet treats — Lulu works for cheese — so pets stay motivated. 5. Keep anxious pets away from action at the front door. Some pets patiently greet kids who arrive in search of treats. If your pet likes to dash, find a quiet spot far from the action and keep them occupied with interactive toys. 6. Monitor that treat bag. Halloween kicks off a season of upset tummies for people and pets. Make sure your pet stays far away from goodie bags and watch for stray pieces of candy that may be on the ground. I keep the ASPCA's Animal Poison Control Center hotline (1-888-426-4435) handy, just in case Lulu finds an unapproved treat. 7. Don't leave pets unattended in costumes. Avoid choking hazards by monitoring your pet while it's dressed as a bumblebee, Honey Boo Boo or whatever else you conjure up. Related on MNN: Dogs decked out for 'Howl-o-ween' 8.

"Was Col. Seymour Pomrenze, my grandfather, more of a Clooney or a Damon? It's not a question I ever thought my family would be discussing. But with the release of ""The Monuments Men"" movie, it was one we jokingly started talking about. The movie tells the story of an ""unlikely World War II platoon, tasked by FDR with going into Germany to rescue artistic masterpieces from Nazi thieves and returning them to their rightful owners."" It's touted as ""Ocean's Eleven"" meets World War II. In the film, a motley crew of architects and art experts risk shootouts with Nazis as they try to protect and save cultural artifacts. The movie isn't bad. For me, though, it's special because without it and the book it was based on, I may never have known that my grandfather was one of the real-life Monuments Men. As a kid, I knew my grandfather had been a colonel in the U.S. Army, which I thought was pretty cool. I also knew he had been an archivist, which was decidedly a bit less cool. To me, he was the kind, quiet and slightly reserved grandfather who came with my attention-grabbing, larger-than-life grandmother. The family joke was always that he was the colonel, but she was the general. We never really talked about what he did, so I figured it involved boring record keeping. Still, with a distinctive last name, I got a kick out of being ""the colonel's grandson."" Before the movie, there was the book of the same name written by Robert Edsel and the foundation he started. Edsel's passion for the subject and his belief that the Monuments Men (almost 350 men and women from 13 countries) hadn't received proper recognition led him to interview my grandfather and others for his book. That's when we first learned his story -- not only what my grandfather had done, but also the scope and significance of what he achieved. Near the end of World War II, my grandfather volunteered for the OSS (the intelligence agency that was the precursor to the CIA), hoping to go overseas. He was assigned to its Research and Analysis division and spent the last months of the war in India, Burma and China. But it was his post-war assignment that would make him a Monuments Man. In early 1946, he was assigned to Offenbach, Germany. Because of his previous work in the National Archives, he became a 29-year old army captain tasked with overseeing a depot filled with whole libraries, documents and cultural artifacts that had been looted by the Nazis. When he first walked into the depot, ""you feel like crying,"" he said in a 1989 interview. ""Here was the horrible, tragic evidence of what happened,"" he said, calling it the ""cultural Holocaust."" His job was to make sense of the millions of volumes, a thousand Torah scrolls and other objects and to figure out a way to get them back to the countries and institutions they belonged to. It doesn't sound like an exciting or adventurous job -- not surprisingly, you don't see a character like my grandfather in the movie. But for a quiet, methodical and analytical archivist and the gargantuan task he was up against, it was the perfect match. The Offenbach Archival Depot, first under my grandfather and then his successors, managed to restitute more than 3 million objects. Some of the more prominent collections that he helped to return, both at Offenbach and in later assignments, included the Rothschild family archives to France, the Rosenthaliana and Spinoza libraries to the Netherlands, and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research collection, which ended up in New York. In the grand scope of World War II, it's a tiny story line. Just a small measure of justice. According to my father, my grandfather ""really felt he was doing his job. He didn't feel like he wasn't recognized, didn't think he was a hero."" He enjoyed and appreciated being part of a group of Monuments Men awarded the National Humanities Medal by President George W. Bush in 2007, but didn't feel like he needed it. He passed away in 2011, but if he were alive today, I think his reaction to the movie would have been the same -- he would have gotten a kick out of it, but probably would have waited to see it on DVD rather than go to the red carpet premiere. The way he described it, ""here I was, a little captain, and I got thrown into this historical Jewish episode."" As someone who loved him but never felt like I knew him the way I wish I could, it's a big deal to recast the way you see your grandfather when he's 90 years old. It helps me understand why the archivist was just as cool as the colonel (as proved by a fellow archivist geeking out over finding a marker he once used), and makes it that much more special when I meet someone who still calls me ""the colonel's grandson.""","""The Monuments Men"" movie rekindles memories of a grandfather's Army service .

"(CNN) -- The evening before they set off on their voyage across the Pacific on Saturday March 20, skipper Jo Royle and David de Rothschild spoke to CNN about their last minute preparations. CNN: How are feeling just hours before sailing? Jo Royle: I'm feeling great. I don't feel nervous at all. I've just left the boat and it's lying a little low in the water as it's loaded up with all the supplies; sustainably-sourced food that we've actually canned ourselves, plus there's loads of camera equipment. All in all, I'm feeling really positive about the voyage and confident in the boat. If anything happens you could not blame the preparation; the energy and passion from everyone has been amazing. David de Rothschild: I think my feelings are best summed up for me by Mark Twain when he wrote: ""Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bow lines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."" CNN: What's been the hardest part of your last minute preparations? Jo Royle: One of the hardest parts is leaving a lot of the team behind. We've spent so much time together sometimes spending 24-hour shifts building the boat, so we've become a really tight knit family. It's also sad to leave San Francisco. It's been such an amazing city to be in to build the boat and launch the project -- it's attracted so many intelligent, positive and creative people to our project . CNN: Jo, you're an experience sailor, how does this expedition feel compared to others? Jo Royle: It does feel a bit different to other journeys in a way. I'm very aware that we have a novice crew, but I'm very positive that everyone has their own role to play. So we'll be off tomorrow morning, slipping our mooring at 9am. The winds will be westerly, which isn't ideal as we really want to be able to sail out under the Golden Gate Bridge. My mum came to see me off and was looking at what I'd packed and and said it was all thermals and warm clothes. We should make our first port in around 30 days. But she said to me, ""What if you end up in San Diego?"" Obviously that's not the plan, but if so you could be seeing me in a bikini and longjohns! Right I'm off to pack up my flat now and see if I can get in one last glass of red wine.","The night before they set off Plastiki skipper Jo Royle spoke to CNN .

"(CNN) -- Elson Kambalu doesn't like to be shoehorned as an artist. Even in his early days, he refused to paint the usual ""traditional"" watercolors of African horizons and indigenous animal kingdom that attract tourists. Instead, he followed his own artistic path and today is one of Malawi's most revered abstract artists. The 40-year-old dreamer has become a champion of the artistic landscape in Malawi, but has also founded Art House Africa, an artistic collective that connects painters and prospective clients. CNN sat down with the passionate artist and entrepreneur to discuss his roots and how he is inspiring enthusiastic creatives in his homeland. CNN: So how did you take that first step into the art world? EK: I decided at the age of 28 to try my luck with a gallerist who was in the vicinity. I presented my works to him and he said: 'No, Elson, I don't think this will sell in this gallery ... Most of the artists, they paint about the Lake, Lake Malawi, they paint about our highest mountain, they paint about our wildlife, because this is what the tourists want to take back when they are going home.' And I said, we could try something different. And that's what we did. Three days later he calls me and says that your work is gone. So that's how it began, I never looked back. CNN: But you continued working as a loan officer until you were 31. Was there a moment when you finally said: 'I want to be an artist?' EK: My break came one day. It was early morning in a toilet when this idea fell on my lap -- To create an art company that would work as a hub for artists. A company that would act as a link between artists and the corporate world. I had the business experience and the land was virgin. There were no art managers on the land and so I felt it would be good to work in that niche. My contract was coming to an end and I was being offered a new contract that would take me to another city. I declined and chose to take my own direction. CNN: How would you describe your artistic style? EK: I am very contemporary, and versatile. I am not a conformist. I am able to move from one medium to another. I am a painter, I am a sculptor, I am a fashion designer, I am a graphic designer, I am a writer, I am a poet, I am a filmmaker. I am a conceptual artist, am an abstract expressionist. I don't want to be identified with one form of art style. CNN: Are there any particular themes you like to showcase? EK: As a visual artist, my past has had a strong bearing on me. Growing up in a big family equaled to lack of resources. The levels of want were quite disturbing, much more especially as I was approaching my teens. Suddenly I discovered that we were poorer than some families. I could not have or eat what I wanted. Those stories of poverty, of want, of freedom, of wanting to survive, have always been part of my subjects. I'm interested in stories of fellow Africans before me who had much harder life. These stories inspire me to create art. I want to create a podium for discussions, in the process hoping to change mindsets and make life better for our future generations. CNN: Who are your artistic heroes? EK: I think I've been inspired by all these great artists. I've been inspired by Salvador Dali, looking at his work. I've been inspired by Pablo Picasso, I've looked at the work of Jackson Pollock, quite beautiful. Rofko, wonderful, and even the young British artists of the 90's. If you look at Damien Hurst, I've seen works by Tracey Emming, and it's all had a bearing on me as an artist. CNN: So what is the Malawian art scene like? EK: I discovered that most of the artists were poorly managed. There were no managers in the arts sector. There is no art school in the country. So what was normally happening is they had the skill, they had this great talent amongst the artist, but they didn't know how to organize themselves. CNN: So you founded Art House Africa and then a few years later you opened a kids studio... EK: We don't have formal art schools and I thought well, this could be a very good avenue for the kids to come in and just prepare them. I think the most important thing in Malawi is the art education. It doesn't necessarily mean that whoever enters an art class will be an artist. But they will make a good audience, or make a good client, because they know the kind of strenuous process artists go through to create whatever they are going to create. If we have the art education in our systems, then we have a community that would appreciate the arts.

"Two days after a deadly explosion ripped through the small Texas town of West, Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton found himself carefully picking through the debris of damaged homes looking for lost pets. Swanton, a public information officer with the Waco Police Department, rushed to the town soon after the explosion, helping staff at the command post. The April 17 blast at the West Fertilizer Co. killed 14 people and injured more than 200. Hundreds were rescued or evacuated throughout the night. Then last Friday, he and a small team of animal control officers were helping rescue animals left behind in the chaos. Some were found wandering among the crumbled ruins. Others remained in their pens and cages, hungry and thirsty. At one point, Swanton walked up to the burned-out shell of what had once been a home. Barely recognizable was the wreckage that had once been a washing machine and dryer. Bricks were still falling. As he approached the foundation, he became aware of a white dove settled in the ruins. ""She let me get within 2-3 feet of her,"" Swanton said. ""It was so peaceful. To me it was a symbol of hope."" Swanton snapped several photos of the dove and posted them to the Facebook page he runs for the Waco Police Department. Before and after: Texas plant explosion . ""She brought an absolute peace to a place of sheer destruction,"" he wrote on the page. ""Keep the faith."" The images were shared more than 2,000 times. With a population of 2,800, West is a small town. When people face such destruction, the animal side of the story takes on a whole new meaning, said Angela Clendenin, spokeswoman for the veterinary emergency team at Texas A&M University. She and 17 others staffed two mobile veterinary clinics, including a surgical suite and a field services truck to assist in the rescue efforts led by Swanson and other first-responders. They treated animals of all kinds, she said, including a bearded dragon lizard, chickens and pigs. Some were treated and released to the Humane Society of Central Texas. Three with more serious injuries were sent to area veterinarians. She described one situation where an officer on patrol in the blast zone spotted a cat in the attic window of an evacuated home. He rescued it and brought it to the clinic at 4 a.m. ""It spoke volumes to the commitment of the officers,"" Clendenin said. One pet owner sought out the rescuers to thank them for their efforts. Swanton said two animal control officers, Joel Sanchez and Louis Leyva, had sat down at the end of the day, trying to collect their thoughts. Suddenly a ""mountain of a man"" appeared and demanded to know which one of them was Louis, Swanton said. Leyva tentatively looked up and identified himself. ""I just want you to know you found my boxer,"" the man bellowed, describing how he'd believed there was little hope of the dog's rescue because of its aggressive nature. Louis then described how he had gently spoken to the boxer and easily gotten a leash on the dog. The man grabbed the officer in a big hug, while his wife tearfully thanked the group, Swanton said. Some of the 75 animals sent to the Humane Society have been reunited with their owners, but Swanton noted: ""It's a long road to hope. It's a long road to recovery. But this town is going to come back stronger and better.""","Animals rescued in the days following the blast included pigs, chickens .

"Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will leave politics when his second term comes to an end, and does not envision a Vladimir Putin-style return to office after sitting out for a term, a German newspaper reported Sunday. ""Eight years are enough,"" the controversial Iranian leader told Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. He's barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term in 2013. Russian President Putin was forced out of office by a similar law, spent one term as prime minister, then returned to office this year. But Putin dominates his country's politics in a way that Ahmadinejad does not, observers say. Ahmadinejad has been in a power struggle with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, and he's losing, according to experts. ""I think Ahmadinejad underestimated the power of Khamenei, and he overestimated his own power,"" Haleh Esfandiari, director of Middle Eastern studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, said last month. ""You can step on anybody's toes, but not on his toe,"" said Esfandiari, who was jailed for more than three months in 2007 during a visit to Iran. She said Ahmadinejad may be left a ""lame duck"" after butting heads with Khamenei. Romney calls Obama weak on Iran . Forces throughout the government have moved to check Ahmadinejad's efforts to replace top officials and have gone after the president's closest advisers, analyst Alireza Nader said. ""I think it's a symptom of the general dissatisfaction with President Ahmadinejad that his powers and movement are being curtailed by the various power centers in Iran,"" said Nader, an expert on Iranian politics at the RAND Corp., an American think tank.","Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is barred from running for a third term in a row .

"President Barack Obama says he's postponing executive action on immigration until after November's elections because it would be ""more sustainable"" then. Speaking to NBC's Chuck Todd, Obama said the immigration debate was affected by concerns over the large number of unaccompanied children from Latin America flocking to the U.S. border. ""The truth of the matter is that the politics did shift mid-summer because of that problem,"" he said. ""What I'm saying is that I'm going to act because it's the right thing for the country,"" Obama said. ""But it's going to be more sustainable and more effective if the public understands what the facts are on immigration, what we've done on unaccompanied children and why it's necessary."" The decision to postpone means any political repercussions for trying to reform the immigration system by himself would come after the congressional midterm contests. Obama still ""will do something before the end of the year"" on the issue, a White House official told CNN on Saturday. People on both sides of the immigration debate criticized the postponement, including pro-immigration reform groups that are impatient for action. Obama has been weighing executive action on immigration -- including moves that could allow a path to legal status for millions of undocumented workers -- after congressional action on the issue stalled. The options could include expanding a deferred deportation program for children of immigrants. But he decided to delay any move to ""take this issue away from those who would use it to score points as a kind of grandstanding issue,"" the White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""It's too big of an issue to allow it to be used as a tool for people trying to get votes,"" the official said. ""It isn't about votes for any particular candidate; it's about dealing with this issue in an environment that avoids the grandstanding we've seen in the past."" Another reason to wait: Should the Democrats retain control of the Senate in November, Republicans may feel it necessary ""to try a different strategy"" and compromise on immigration, the White House official said. Scott Brown criticizes move . Republican Scott Brown, the former U.S. senator from Massachusetts who is now running for Senate from New Hampshire, ripped the move, saying it was a cynical ploy to protect Obama's fellow Democrats for the elections. After Obama threatened to take executive action this summer, Republicans pushed back, saying among other things that the President shouldn't remove Congress from the equation. Some GOP lawmakers had suggested holding up a bill funding federal agencies -- thus forcing a government shutdown -- if Obama took unilateral action. ""President Obama's decision to delay executive action to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants until after the election is of little comfort to people like myself who believe in the rule of law,"" said Brown, who faces Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in November. House Speaker John Boehner said Saturday there was ""never a 'right' time"" for the President to take action by himself. ""But the decision to simply delay this deeply controversial and possibly unconstitutional unilateral action until after the election -- instead of abandoning the idea altogether -- smacks of raw politics,"" the top House Republican said. The Democratic National Committee blasted the Republican criticism. ""The GOP, the party that has blocked meaningful comprehensive immigration reform at every turn and sued the President for acting, is now outraged that he hasn't taken steps that many in their party deemed impeachable offenses,"" the committee said in a statement. But pro-immigration reform groups weren't impressed with the delay. The website of one group, United We Dream, displayed a message Saturday that Obama ""has further cemented his legacy as the #DeporterInChief by delaying the usage of his executive authority to stop the deportation of millions of immigrants."" Cristina Jimenez of United We Dream said: ""The President's latest broken promise is another slap to the face of the Latino and immigrant community."" The immigration challenge . An estimated 11 million or more immigrants are living illegally in the United States, many of them for years or even decades. The Obama administration has deported or turned back more than 2 million people. Last year, the Senate passed a comprehensive bill that would provide a path to legal status for the millions of long-term undocumented immigrants while also strengthening border security. The legislation would have required immigrants illegally living in the country to register with the government, pay a penalty, learn English and begin the process of applying for legal status. It had the backing of the business community, organized labor and religious organizations. However, House Republicans refused to consider the Senate bill, which Obama and Democrats claim would pass if put to a vote. Conservatives say the Senate plan amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers, arguing they should be sent back to their home countries because they drive up the size and cost of government while competing with U.S. citizens for jobs. Democrats want to remove the legal uncertainty for as many of the undocumented immigrants as possible, allowing them to continue living and working here so they can eventually gain legal status and possibly full citizenship. What Obama has been considering . Among the actions that Obama was considering as recently as August, according to reform advocates involved in conversations with the White House: an expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It allows immigrants brought to the country illegally as children to stay without fear of deportation and apply for work permits if they meet certain criteria. So far, some 660,000 young people have taken advantage of the program, according to a report by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. That's 55% of the 1.2 million who were immediately eligible. Advocates said the administration also has been considering expanding the program to cover the parents of U.S. citizens or all undocumented parents. The White House could also decide to cover undocumented immigrants in industries such as farming, or it could expand deportation relief based on how long a person has been living and working in the community. While there are many different mechanisms that could be used to provide relief, using the existing program as the template is an attractive alternative because that process has been running since 2012. Many Republicans have called for immigration reform that includes tighter border controls. Before for August recess, the Republican-controlled House passed a bill that would have prevented Obama from granting new deferrals -- or even renewing previously granted ones -- under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The Senate has not taken up the bill.

"This was the miracle of Medinah. In 1999, it was the United States who stunned the European team as they overhauled a four-point deficit to win at Brookline. On Sunday, Europe inflicted an identical comeback on Davis Love III's Americans as Martin Kaymer held his nerve to hole the most dramatic of putts and ensure a 14 1/2 - 13 1/2 point victory for Jose Maria Olazabal's team. Playing in the blue and white outfits made famous by the legendary Seve Ballesteros, Europe's players produced a performance that the late Spaniard would have been proud of despite trailing 10-6 heading into the final day in Illinois. ""It's very hard to describe my emotions,"" European captain Olazabal told reporters. ""When I saw we had a chance this afternoon coming down the stretch, I was very emotional, I started thinking about the possibility of winning. ""The boys have been unbelievable. I started thinking about my friend Seve and this one is for him. ""I have never experienced anything like this. This event is so special."" While the U.S. had dominated the first two days of the competition, they simply had no answer to a European team determined to honor Ballesteros' memory. U.S. close in on Ryder Cup glory despite late Poulter heroics . Olazabal's players struggled to keep up with the U.S. in the fourballs and the foursomes, but they raced out of the traps from the very first tee shot of the singles matches. Led by Luke Donald, who comprehensively saw off Bubba Watson in the opening game, Europe rode on the crest of a wave with Englishman Ian Poulter, who won four of his matches, at the center of the charge. Ryder Cup revolutionaries: Seve and Ollie . Poulter, a wildcard pick by captain Olazabal, justified his selection as he saw off  U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson 2&1. ""Ollie said to us at the start of the week, Ryder Cup is what memories and dreams are made of, and he's been awesome,"" explained an emotional Poulter. ""And last night in that team room was buzzing. We weren't four down. We were all square. We just knew we had a chance and do you know what? This is history right here. This has been unbelievable. ""I'm going to enjoy it, with the best team I've ever seen, and the best captain I've ever seen, and everyone else, because this right here is special."" Scotland's Paul Lawrie, playing in the Ryder Cup for the first time since Brookline 13 years ago, claimed Europe's second point of the day, thrashing FedEx Cup playoff winner Brandt Snedeker 5&3. With the momentum firmly behind Europe, world No. 1 Rory McIlroy edged out impressive rookie Keegan Bradley 2&1 before Poulter brought Europe level. Big-hitter Dustin Johnson got the first point of the day for the U.S. following a 3&2 win over the equally powerful Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium. While that victory was met with loud cheers, the joy was short lived as England's Justin Rose showed nerves of steel over the final three holes to see off four-time major winner Phil Mickelson. Rose was trailing going into the 17th, but holed a stunning putt to level before sneaking beyond Mickelson at the last for a 2 up victory. The U.S. moved ahead once again to lead 12-11 following Zach Johnson's 2&1 win over Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell, who struggled for form throughout. But Europe refused to give up and former world No. 1 Lee Westwood holed his putt on the 16th hole to secure a 3&2 win over Matt Kuchar and round off a difficult week on a high note. There was further drama as experienced American Jim Furyk lost out to Spanish Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia. Furyk thought he had won the match on the 16th and began to celebrate as his ball circled the lip of the cup -- only to agonizingly roll out. Faldo backs McIlroy to roar over Tiger . The consistent Jason Dufner, a winner of three points from four matches, saw off Peter Hanson to make it 13-13 as the tension increased. With two matches remaining on the course both teams sensed victory but it was Europe which held its nerve. Germany's Kaymer took a one-shot lead on the 17th and then produced the defining moment of the 39th Ryder Cup -- holing the crucial putt on the last to defeat Steve Stricker and ensure the U.S. could not reach the winning target of 14 1/2 points. That left Europe on 14 points and Italian Francesco Molinari secured the half point needed to win the cup outright after finishing level with 14-time major winner Tiger Woods. ""They played very, very well,"" said U.S. captain Love III. ""They holed putts when they had to. We never got that big chip in or that big shot, maybe it just wasn't our week. ""The Europeans played with class and I congratulate them. We never took this for granted. We had a lot of guys who got beat today, I don't know if they played badly but they didn't win. ""There's probably a lot I'd change now we didn't win. It'll be disappointing when we think about how well we played and didn't win. It's not good for us, but it's good for golf this Ryder Cup.""","Europe pull of a stunning turnaround to win the Ryder Cup 14.5-13.5 .

"For a long time it feels like we haven't seen much of Ronald McDonald. Not for nothing, but I heard he shanked Grimace in a back alley somewhere down in Mexico. That's the rumor, anyway. However, now the famous fast-food clown is back in the spotlight, and everything seems right in his world. McDonald's re-introduced Ronald on Wednesday, stating that he is ""setting out on a global mission to rally the public through inspiring events."" I'm sort of hoping this involves feats of strength, motorcycles, and explosions. And maybe some AC/DC. But probably not. Either way, good for him. It's hard to find honest work, especially when your LinkedIn skills include applying heavy makeup and crying yourself to sleep. Of course, Ronald McDonald, who's been the face of the company since 1963, is more than just a clown who goes on global missions. Because behind all that face paint lies a ruthless hamburger kingpin with a never-say-die attitude, capable of striking fear into his trembling sales team. ""Put that McCafe Coffee down! McCafe coffee's for closers only."" Yes, some may criticize Ronald for being too influential, as he entices kids to eat unhealthy fast food. I don't know the exact psychology behind it, but, presumably, it works like this: . ""Hey kids, look at the funny clown. Wee! How 'bout a Happy Meal?"" And I'm OK with that. They're overseeing a restaurant business. It's not like McDonald's is a tattoo parlor. ""Hey kids, look at the funny clown. Wee! How 'bout a koi fish on your neck?"" So, he's a hamburger salesman. Big deal. A little diabetes never hurt anyone. But as major companies move forward with trends in society, sometimes even cultural icons need a dramatic makeover. So, a major part of the big rollout was some new, updated clothes. And when you're talking about the one and only Ronald McDonald, that requires strategy and careful planning. You can't just throw this guy in a car and drive him down to Old Navy. ""Here's 50 bucks. Go nuts."" I mean, the man is a legend. He deserves only the best. Which is why Ronald's new wardrobe was created by Ann Hould-Ward, an accomplished theatrical designer who won a Tony Award for ""Beauty and the Beast."" That said, it's entirely possible that the marketing team simply threw Ann in a car and drove HER down to Old Navy, because Ronald's new getup includes cargo pants and a technical vest, as well as a red and white striped long-sleeve rugby shirt. Your Old Navy basics. Though, in all fairness, it looks OK. Somehow, Ronald does sort of come off as fairly modern and relaxed, like a 20-something heading out to see the Dave Matthews Band. Still, it's worth noting that, amongst all these major changes, his iconic giant red shoes haven't. And he also now has a ""whimsical"" new blazer for special occasions. Say, perhaps, a bris. ""Nice work, Rabbi."" ""Thanks, Clown."" But it wasn't just a wardrobe makeover. When McDonald's revealed Ronald 2014 to the world this week, the company also shared a new mission: Fun makes great things happen. The idea, McDonald's says, is that moments of fun and enjoyment bring out the simple pleasures in life and can lead to acts of goodness. And it's true. The other day I walked out my house without pants. Next thing you know I'm volunteering at a bake sale. It feels nice to give back to the community. Beyond his updated clothes and new personal mission handed down from the Filet-O-Fish gods, what's most fun about this whole new and improved Ronald is that now he's even taking on social media. In fact, Ronald's actually been given the password for the official McDonald's Twitter account. That's a lot of trust for a guy who hangs out with somebody named The Hamburglar. While Ronald won't actually have his own personal Twitter handle, he has been authorized to use his full name as a hashtag, marking the first time he's taken an active part in the company's social media strategy. Really, the whole thing seems perfectly harmless. At least until he comes home buzzed after a Tinder date. ""Boom! Two words.

"In his final moments, 8-year-old Tyler Doohan managed to rescue six people -- including two younger children -- from a burning mobile home in upstate New York, authorities said. A last-ditch effort, however, to save his disabled grandfather cost the boy his life. His body was found next to his grandfather, whom Tyler considered a best friend. ""It makes me really proud, it really does, but I just want him back,"" Tyler's mother, Crystal Vrooman, told CNN affiliate WHAM. Tyler, an East Rochester resident, was staying at the home of relatives in the nearby town of Penfield on Sunday night when he noticed a fire in the single-wide trailer, said Penfield Fire Chief Chris Ebmeyer. As firefighters and sheriff's deputies responded to 4:45 a.m. emergency call, Tyler was able to wake six other people in the small trailer, including two more children, ages 4 and 6, the fire chief said. Then Tyler went back into the blaze to help his grandfather, who was disabled and would have been unable to get out of the home on his own, Ebmeyer said. ""By that time, the fire had traveled to the back of the trailer,"" said Ebmeyer. ""Unfortunately they both succumbed to heat and smoke."" The pair were found together on a bed in the back room. It appeared that the boy was trying to lift his grandfather from the bed when he was overcome by the smoke and fire, the fire chief said. Tyler and his grandfather were like best friends, Vrooman said. An online fundraising campaign on YouCaring.com had raised more than $28,000 as of Wednesday for Tyler's funeral and his family. Another relative was found dead in a front room, although his exact relation to Tyler was not clear. Earlier, fire officials had released a mistaken version of the incident, where the grandfather's and uncle's locations were switched, due to incorrect information provided by a family member. Tyler's mother said the boy broke away from his aunt outside the burning trailer and ran back inside to try to save his grandfather. ""All I could think about is how he couldn't breathe,"" Vrooman told WHAM. She added: ""I'm just so grateful that he went with people that he loved. He didn't go alone."" The cause of the blaze is still under investigation but believed to be accidental. The conditions of the six survivors were not immediately available. Ebmeyer said the trailer had no working smoke detector. He said that with so many people in one small mobile home, one alarm could have easily woken everyone in time to escape. There was at least one space heater inside the trailer, the fire chief said. Several pets -- including dogs, cats, a rabbit and hamsters -- also died in the fire, Ebmeyer said.

"The New York state's health exchange website offers a slew of organizations in place to help people sign up for coverage. There's just one problem: This week, the list included businesses whose owners have no idea how to give New Yorkers health insurance advice. ""I can fix your car, but I don't think I can fix your health,"" Marco Abad of Zambrand Auto Repair told CNN on Wednesday. Abad said they were surprised when their Brooklyn business started receiving calls yesterday about the Affordable Care Act. The health insurance marketplace opened on October 1, providing a navigator with a 230-page list of agency locations and site schedules in New York state, including phone numbers to call with health insurance inquiries. The list intentionally includes details for places like coffee shops where, even if they're not a place you'd normally associate with health care, people can meet with advisers who can guide them toward a plan, New York state health department spokesman Bill Schwarz explained. Yet in some cases, addresses and phone numbers for such advisers were listed incorrectly, Schwarz said. In other cases, the information is correct but the ""navigator"" (the person who can lead individuals through the health care process) didn't tell the proprietors of the listed meeting place about it. Either way, the state spokesman said these errors don't appear to be pervasive or statewide. Even if they are fixed by week's end, as Schwarz promised, the errors by then already will have caused plenty of headaches -- like for Gus Rodriguez, manager of Brooklyn Cupcake. He said his shop has received an additional 25 calls per day since the beginning of October -- just not because of an increased interest in their sweet confections. Apex Car and Limo Inc. manager Dmitry Rozalovsky told CNN they were confused by the Obamacare-related calls they received, but didn't put two and two together until members of the media showed up outside their Brooklyn location Wednesday. ""First, we thought it was kind of a joke,"" Roxalovsky said. Bowery Pharmacy manager Patrick Wu said his establishment too has been getting calls. According to Wu, the Manhattan pharmacy usually gets two to three calls per day. But since October 1, Wu said he's personally answered more than 50 additional calls each day from New Yorkers inquiring about health insurance. At first, the callers are confused, but then get ""very frustrated"" when they realize they're not speaking to an Affordable Care Act navigator, Wu said. Wu, who filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Health, said he is also frustrated because the misguided phone calls distract him from the pharmacy's business. ""They interrupt my work,"" Wu said. Rodriguez said he informed the state health department about the mistake, but said they are still receiving the calls. On the bright side, Brooklyn Cupcake employees are hopeful the extra calls will result in more cupcake sales, he said. ""We can't help with Obamacare, but we're pretty good with cupcakes around here; so we do offer those in lieu of some health care options,"" Rodriguez said, laughing.","The errors aren't pervasive or statewide, a state health spokesman says .

"Edna, Texas, is a small town, which means Trey Ganem knew the family that lost five children in a mobile home fire. His son played varsity football with 15-year-old Noah Ortiz, the oldest of the five children who died in the November 25 blaze. Ganem's daughter went to school with 11-year-old Julian Ortiz. Their parents, Annabel Ortiz and Johnny Hernandez, lost their home and all but one of their children in the fire. The community was quick to rally, raising more than $28,000 online to help with funeral expenses and rebuilding their lives. Ganem was more than willing to help out by doing what he does every day: designing custom caskets with a bit of personality. ""I just wanted to do something to help,"" Ganem said. Ganem made five caskets free of charge at the request of the family. Instead of dressing them in a somber brown wood, Ganem designed each casket to reflect the children's personalities. For Noah Ortiz, that means a casket bearing his school colors and mascot, the cowboy, and his number-50 football jersey. Julian Ortiz, the wrestling fan, will be laid to rest in a black casket with his name in red letters and a W resembling the WWE logo. Six-year-old Nicholas Ortiz loved video games. His black casket features the ""Call of Duty"" logo and the phrase, ""Nicholas Got Called To Duty."" Sisters Areyanah Hernandez, 6, and Lilyana Hernandez, 5, loved the movie ""Frozen."" Their pink and blue glittered caskets are topped with princess crowns. Ganem, an artist who spent most of his career designing hot rods, started applying his skills to caskets this year. It's sad work, but he said it's worth it to see how his caskets can change the mood of a room, especially at a child's funeral. ""It's heart-wrenching for me, but when I can provide just a little bit of comfort for the families, that's all I'm looking for,"" he said. ""Every casket I work on, I treat it like it's for my my son or my dad.""","Texas family loses five children in mobile home fire .

"Strep throat should not kill you. Nor should a knee scratch that becomes infected. For decades, the world has relied upon antibiotics to treat common infections. As bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics, these minor afflictions could soon become life-threatening. Procedures that place patients at risk of infection, like hip replacements, dental work and open-heart surgery, could become far more dangerous. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in October that antibiotic-resistant bacteria -- known as ""superbugs"" -- cause at least two million infections and 23,000 deaths in the United States yearly. The cost to the U.S. health care system has been pegged at $17 billion to $26 billion annually. In 1977, the Food and Drug Administration found that feeding antibiotics to food animals at low doses, both to promote growth and to prevent disease, contributes to this public health crisis. The CDC concurred: ""[M]uch of antibiotic use in animals is unnecessary and inappropriate and makes everyone less safe."" The World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and many others have called for restrictions. In the almost four decades since the FDA acknowledged this problem, Congressional opposition and intense industry lobbying has blocked meaningful action -- even as hundreds of scientific studies have confirmed the link between antibiotic misuse in food animals and superbug infections in humans. This month, the FDA issued voluntary guidelines designed to curb the misuse of antibiotics in animals. If history is any indication, the impact will be minimal on industries that have spent millions fighting mandatory regulation. Industrial operations that produce most food animals in this country administer low doses of antibiotics to make animals grow faster and to prevent diseases from breaking out in crowded and unsanitary conditions. Using low doses of antibiotics in livestock exposes bacteria to just enough antibiotics to kill the most susceptible bugs while allowing resistant germs to thrive and reproduce. Resistant bacteria are found in higher numbers on people who work at these operations, who can bring superbugs home with them into their communities. Resistant bacteria can also contaminate meat during slaughter. Fruits and vegetables that are fertilized with animal waste may be tainted as well. The more superbugs, the more likely they are to cause infections that are expensive and difficult to treat. Some may not be treatable at all. The FDA's guidelines ask industry not to use antibiotics for growth promotion but permit use of antibiotics for routine disease prevention with a veterinary prescription. This not only leaves producers with a loophole to continue using antibiotics for growth promotion by simply calling it another name, it also provides a disincentive to clean up their facilities. Instead, the industry can use the simplest, cheapest and most dangerous method to keep livestock healthy: antibiotics. The agency argues that veterinarians will ensure responsible use, but most livestock and poultry are overseen by veterinarians employed by companies that have spent years fighting regulation. The FDA has emphasized that drug companies support its plan. That is no surprise: if antibiotics can still be used routinely for disease prevention, they will be sold in the same quantities, and industry will still make millions of dollars. The chief executive of the largest animal drug company said the guidelines ""will not have a significant impact on our revenues."" It is difficult to fathom why the FDA expects the drug industry to voluntarily reduce its sales when 80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States are sold for use on the farm. Industry support follows decades of opposition to more meaningful restrictions by the drug and farm lobbies. In 2008, the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, which included veterinarians and infectious disease experts, recommended banning antibiotic use for growth promotion and disease prevention. A recent report by the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future detailed how commission recommendations have been blocked by companies intent on maintaining the status quo. Take for example the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA), a bill that would save eight classes of antibiotic for use on humans and sick animals and which has been the subject of frequent industry attacks. Out of 225 lobbying reports filed in the 112th Congress on PAMTA, 195 reports (87.5%) were submitted on behalf of entities hostile to the legislation. Medical and consumer advocacy groups filed only 30 of the 225 reports (12.5%). With millions of infections and thousands of deaths linked to antibiotic resistance, we cannot wait any longer to take meaningful action. The World Health Organization has warned that antibiotic resistance could mean ""an end to modern medicine as we know it."" It is time for Congress to stop resisting meaningful regulations to curb the misuse of antibiotics and step up to the plate.","Superbugs in farm animals have become resistant to many antibiotics .
Slaughter: New FDA voluntary guidelines on antibiotic use aren't strong enough .
Slaughter: Industry has a giant loophole to allow use ."

"Ethiopia is turning to renewable energy technology as the East African country looks to become a powerhouse for its regional partners. Last month, Ethiopia launched one of the continent's largest wind farms in a bid to rapidly boost its generating capacity over the next three to five years. The Ashegoda Wind Farm and the Grand Renaissance Dam, under construction on the Nile, are just two of the major projects outlined in the Ethiopian government's five-year Growth and Transformation Plan. Both developments will see Ethiopia's transition into one of the regions biggest energy exporters as electric output surges from 2,000 megawatts (MW) to 10,000 MW. More than half of this is expected to come from the Renaissance Dam. Read more: Africa's giant infrastructure projects . And with further commitments to geothermal power and potential for oil exploration, Ethiopia's energy resources are set to be among the most diversified in Africa. Ashegoda wind farm . Jerome Douat, chief executive of Vergnet, the French wind turbine company contracted to build the Ashegoda farm, told CNN that Ethiopia is an energy ""reservoir"" in the region. Douat said: ""The wind comes from the ocean to the Rift Valley. We have placed the turbines at 2,200 meters above sea level in one of the windiest places in Ethiopia."" The wind farm, with a capacity of 120 MW,  is located near the northern city of Mek'ele and sits next to the Great Rift Valley, which runs through the country. Douat added: ""Vergnet machines are ideal for remote areas in Ethiopia and designed for this kind of region because our turbines are easy to transport, there's no need for a big crane and they're easier to maintain."" With just 23% of Ethiopia's 90 million people having access to electricity the wind farm is expected to generate power throughout the year, except during the rainy season between June and September. Vergnet built the Ashegoda site in partnership with the Ethiopian government at a cost of 210 million euros ($290 million) with loans from France's largest bank BNP Paribas and the French Development Agency. Will Macpherson, sub-Saharan African energy analyst at African Energy Consultancy, said Ethiopia is aiming to be the region's major supplier, working with foreign investors to provide power to neighbouring Sudan, Djibouti and Kenya. ""People in the energy industry, particularly in renewables, say the government is good to work with,"" he told CNN, ""they deliver on commitments and build good relationships with investors."" ""One of its central aims is to improve access rates across the country,"" he added, ""but (the government) also recognizes that it's vulnerable to seasonal variations in rainfall, so even if it really boosts its installed capacity, which it's doing, it could still suffer from power outages."" Read more: DR Congo's mega dam ambitions . According to the country's five-year plan, which runs to 2015, the government is also seeking investment in geothermal and biofuel production to offset any problems with wind. Macpherson believes this will diversify the country's energy supply, while adding that other African nations will soon begin to follow suit. He said: ""In Kenya, a 300 MW wind power project will be commissioned near Lake Turkana in 2015, and the country is leading the way in geothermal. South Africa has also been very successful in developing renewable projects."" Macpherson also noted that Ethiopia is keen on oil exploration in the Ogaden Basin. The field, which lies in the east of the country, is believed to contain vast oil and gas reserves, according to SouthWest energy, a national exploration company. Ethiopia's big leap forward . The Ashegoda Wind Farm and the Grand Renaissance Dam mark a major leap forward for a country that spent parts of the last century ravaged by war and famine. And while Ethiopia still faces major social problems with poverty and living standards, the country has managed to emerge as one of Africa's fastest growing economies, recording 8.5% growth in 2012. The mega-dam, scheduled for completion by July 2017, is likely to spur economic growth further. At a cost of $4.7 billion, the dam will create 12,000 jobs and generate 6,000 MW of energy, according to the government. Read more: Ghana plans $10 billion tech city . Sitting on the Blue Nile river, the dam will also serve neighboring Sudan and Egypt, despite concerns from those countries that Ethiopia will have too much control over a vital water source in the region. Last month, in a further move to boost energy supplies, the Ethiopian government signed a contract with U.S.-Icelandic development company Reykjavik Geothermal to develop one of the world's largest geothermal power projects. The plant is part of U.S. President Barack Obama's $7 billion Power Africa initiative, which aims to double energy access in sub-Saharan African. Reykjavik Geothermal will invest $4 billion into the project and will provide 1,000 MW of power to Ethiopia  by 2018. When complete, it will be Ethiopia's biggest foreign direct investment, said the firm. At the unveiling of the geothermal project in New York last month, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said: ""My vision is that over the next 30 years, we will need to harness as much as 80,000 MW of hydro, geothermal, wind and solar power, not just for Ethiopia, but for our neighboring countries as well.""","Ethiopia is launching numerous renewable energy projects .

"A Swedish appeals court on Thursday denied WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's latest request to dismiss an arrest warrant for alleged rape and molestation -- cases that he says are false and politically motivated. Assange, 43, has been living in London's Ecuadorian Embassy for more than two years to avoid extradition to Sweden, where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. Assange, who has not been charged, denies the allegations and says he fears Sweden would extradite him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through WikiLeaks. The Australia native has argued the warrant should be dismissed because, in part, Swedish authorities refuse to interview him at the Ecuadorian Embassy, thereby prolonging a preliminary investigation that he says should have concluded long ago. The appellate court nodded to this argument, agreeing that ""the failure of the prosecutors to examine alternative avenues is not in line with their obligation ... to move the preliminary investigation forward."" But it concluded that, in balance, the arrest warrant must remain in effect because the crimes alleged are serious and because ""there is a great risk that he will flee and thereby evade legal proceedings if the detention order is set aside."" ""In the view of the court of appeal, these circumstances mean that the reasons for detention still outweigh the intrusion or other detriment entailed by the detention order,"" appellate judges wrote in Thursday's ruling. Another appeal expected . Michael Ratner, a U.S. attorney for Assange, expressed dismay over the ruling. ""The court of appeals admits the prosecutor has wrongly failed to move this case forward, but refuses to provide Assange with any remedy. It is astonishing,"" Ratner said in a news release. Assange's legal team has said it intends to file an appeal with Sweden's Supreme Court. Thursday's court decision follows a similar ruling by a lower Swedish court in July. Assange argues, in part, that the preliminary investigation has been open for an unacceptably long time, and that the arrest warrant improperly keeps him from going to Ecuador, which offered him asylum, or even from going outdoors. Police stand guard outside the embassy, ready to arrest him should he emerge. Swedish prosecutors say that Assange must be interviewed in Sweden, citing what they say are legal impediments to coercing an interview elsewhere. Prosecutor Marianne Ny has said that the warrant could remain in place until the statute of limitations takes effect -- five years for unlawful coercion and 10 years for rape. Assange rocketed to international fame when WikiLeaks began publishing secret government documents online. After it published the procedures manual for the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay in 2007, it posted documents related to U.S. activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, and diplomatic cables from U.S. embassies. In August 2010, Swedish prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Assange over the allegations of sexual assault from two female WikiLeaks volunteers. He turned himself in to London authorities the same year, and was remanded in custody. At the time, a judge ruled that he should be extradited to Sweden, and Assange launched a series of appeals that went all the way to the British Supreme Court. It denied his appeal. In June 2012, Assange fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy to seek asylum, which was granted in August of the same year. He's been living at the embassy in London since then.","Court agrees with Assange that prosecutors dragged their feet, but says warrant must stay .

"About 8.4 million people can rightfully call themselves New Yorkers, according to 2013 census data. There are no official numbers to back this up, but it'd be a pretty solid bet to say that an awful lot of them have never spent much time exploring the Bronx beyond Yankee Stadium, the Bronx Zoo, the Bronx Botanical Gardens and maaayyybe going out for a plate of manicotti and some tiramisu on Arthur Avenue. And that's a friggin' shame. Not only is the Bronx home to a hefty wedge of the Big Apple's residents -- around 1.4 million of them -- it's also the birthplace and steward of some of America's greatest achievements in art and culture.

There's a saying that ""only the dead know Brooklyn."" That may be true of the Bronx too. In the borough's Woodlawn Cemetery, the collective knowledge of permanent residents makes up some of the best of American culture. Commune with the spirits of Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Celia Cruz, Irving Berlin, Herman Melville, Countee Cullen, Ralph Bunche, Fiorello La Guardia, Robert Moses, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Madam C.J. Walker and other borough luminaries in a 400-acre outdoor museum where lot owners are encouraged to celebrate. Wave Hill . In the midst of NYC's concrete jungle lies an oasis of serenity in the form of 28 meticulously tended acres of gardens, greenhouses, walks and trails and a cultural center geared toward getting city residents in touch with the natural world around them. Organized gatherings aren't allowed on the Wave Hill premises, but the public is welcome to pack lunches, stroll through the grounds and attend talks, lectures and concerts. While there is generally an entrance fee, Target sponsors free hours on Tuesday and Saturday mornings year-round. Grand Concourse . This truly grand stretch of boulevard is the Bronx's answer to Paris' Champs-Elysees -- but in true NYC style, stretches even longer and wider. The mostly Art Deco-lined thoroughfare runs from 138th Street to Mosholu Parkway and showcases some of the finest architectural facades and structures in all the five boroughs. The historic district designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission is between 153rd and 167th Streets, easily accessible from the subway (try the B, D, 4 to 161st St-Yankee Stadium), and should by all rights include a stop in Joyce Kilmer Park, named for the soldier and writer best known for the poem ""Trees."" Bronx Museum of the Arts . This museum has a mission: making the arts accessible to everyone, regardless of income level. On its 40th anniversary in 2011, the museum instituted a free admission policy, allowing the entire community -- especially schoolchildren, artists and families -- to experience its permanent collection and special exhibitions of prints, painting, installations, photographs, sculpture, films, poetry and movement. Curators pay special attention to giving visibility to artists of African, Asian and Latin-American descent, and those with direct ties to the Bronx. City Island . While the rest of the borough is the only part of NYC contiguous with the mainland, the Bronx's City Island is surrounded by Long Island Sound and Eastchester Bay and stands as a living monument to New York's nautical history. The island is accessible by drawbridge (city bus BX 29 will take you straight over it) and boasts some of the best seafood restaurants -- and boating and fishing opportunities -- the city has to offer. If it looks somehow familiar, that may be because it's served as the backdrop for plenty of films including ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" ""A Bronx Tale,"" ""Butterfield 8"" and the eponymous ""City Island."" Wakefield and Woodlawn . When people think Bronx eats, it's usually Arthur Avenue pasta and Yankee Stadium hot dogs that come to mind. Those are all well and good, but the borough is filled with ethnic enclaves of people who like to feast as well. Head to Wakefield for heady African and Caribbean flavors and Woodlawn for hearty Irish fare. And for those worried about where to pop in for a pint or a roti, Noshwalks tour guides can help visitors balance out their caloric intake with a little legwork in between bites. TAG Public Arts . Street art doesn't usually get a co-sign from building owners, but in 2012, Jay Sinxero-Beltran started the TAG Public Arts Project to get landlords to team up with graffiti artists to create one-of-a-kind -- and totally legal -- paintings on their public walls. TAG has been endorsed by The Bronx Council on the Arts and has a stated mission of ""enhancing the visual landscape of urban communities with art."" Bronx Historical Tours offers a bus-driven exploration through the borough-wide outdoor gallery. Edgar Allen Poe Cottage . Before his mysterious 1849 death in Baltimore, Edgar Allen Poe spent his twilight years in a cottage at Kingsbridge Road and the Grand Concourse. He wrote some of his best-known works there, including ""The Bells,"" ""Annabel Lee"" and ""Eureka."" Poe and his wife Virginia moved to the Bronx in the hope that the country air (why yes -- country air in the Bronx) would soothe the ravages wrought upon her by tuberculosis, but she succumbed nonetheless. The cottage has been fully restored to its period appearance by the Bronx County Historical Society and is open to the public on the weekends and groups (by appointment) throughout the week.","Go beyond Yankee Stadium and the zoo to explore the best of the Bronx .

"Activists were calling for students to walk out of school and employees to walk off the job nationwide Monday to protest police violence. Organizers said at least 60 such events were planned around the country, mostly at colleges and universities, according to a website listing the protests. At the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, protesters planned a die-in at the student union, while demonstrators in Illinois were asking students and employees along the Chicago Loop to walk out of school and work together, to name a few of the planned demonstrations. In solidarity with Ferguson, Missouri, most of the protests were planned at 12:01 p.m. CT, the time Michael Brown was shot. Over the Thanksgiving weekend, Ferguson-area organizers called for a Black Friday shopping boycott, forcing the St. Louis Galleria Mall to shut down temporarily on the busiest shopping day of the year. St. Louis officials urged Galleria retailers to close security gates after several hundred protesters entered the mall and disrupted shopping. Protesters chanted, ""Hands up, don't shop,"" while others lay on the floor in a ""die-in."" If supporters did shop, they were told to take their money to black-owned businesses, some of which were listed on social media. Brown, the teenager, was black; Officer Darren Wilson, who shot him, is white.","At least 60 walkout events planned around the country in solidarity with Ferguson .

"Looking pale, thin and emotional, Gilad Shalit was reunited with his family Tuesday after more than five years in captivity. Now he faces what is likely to be a bewildering few days, weeks and months as he readjusts to a life of liberty. While no one yet knows exactly what he went through, other captives' experiences give an insight into his likely state of mind -- and suggest that although he has his freedom, other challenges lie ahead. Only 19 at the time of his capture in June 2006, Shalit was known to few outside his circle of family, friends and fellow soldiers. But after years spent in virtual isolation, he has been thrust into the limelight and faces a barrage of media attention. Speaking to Egyptian television shortly after his release, Shalit said he had missed his family and friends. ""I missed interacting with normal people,"" he told the interviewer. A few details emerged later as his father, Noam Shalit, addressed the throng of reporters gathered outside the family's home in northern Israel. His son felt good, he said, but was suffering the effects of small shrapnel wounds received long ago but never properly treated, as well as a lack of sunlight. While Gilad was very happy to be home, it was difficult for him to be exposed to so many people after so long in isolation, unable to speak to anyone in his own language, Noam Shalit said. ""He basically came out of a dark hole, a dark basement, and came out of that to this great crowd,"" he said, adding that it must have been amazing for his son to see such a show of support from their village and the country. The family had greeted Gilad with big hugs, he said, but so far they had had little chance to do more than eat together in what had been an exhausting day. ""He said in the beginning the conditions were difficult and he wasn't particularly well treated, but more recently things improved,"" he said of his son, adding that he was sure the family would learn more over time. David Senesh, an Israeli clinical psychologist and former prisoner of war based near Tel Aviv, told CNN that Shalit may continue to feel isolated despite being back among loved ones. ""I think the most difficult thing he will have to cope with is that he has been going through an experience that is very difficult to communicate, to explain to the ordinary person,"" he said. But Senesh said it was a good sign that Shalit had expressed a wish to talk about his ordeal. ""That will help his readjustment as long as it comes from him and is not solicited by the media or other people,"" he said. Senesh, who was held for 40 days in an Egyptian jail following the Yom Kippur War in 1973, said his own experience was made easier by being held with fellow prisoners and, on his release, returning to the familiarity of his army unit. But Shalit has been kept in virtual isolation. And his long captivity has not only affected him but also the family members who have ""gone through hell"" by extension, as they feared for his safety and fought for his freedom, Senesh said. ""It will be difficult to adjust to normal life. He will have to find out what it is because it's not what he left five years ago. It's a completely different life, different family,"" Senesh said. ""Everybody is involved with the trauma."" He suggests that what Shalit will most need is time and a period of peace and privacy to come to terms with what he has experienced. But unlike some prisoners of war in previous decades, Shalit will not have to deal with the trauma alone. Israel has many professionals who can provide support and advice based on the experiences of others who have been held captive, Senesh said, and there is an enormous desire in Israel to see him recover fully. While little is known about Shalit's day-to-day conditions, the fact he appears healthy -- if thin and wan -- is promising, said Walter Busuttil, a physician and retired Royal Air Force wing commander who was part of a clinical team that rehabilitated British hostages released from Lebanon in 1991, among them Terry Waite, a former envoy to the archbishop of Canterbury. But medical professionals will need to monitor Shalit's sleep and weight patterns for signs he is suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, said Busuttil, now medical director for the British veterans' charity Combat Stress. If he was blindfolded or had disrupted sleep or irregular meals during his captivity, Shalit will need to adjust, Busuttil said. Weight loss can also be an indicator of other ill treatment, he added. The soldier's youth may have been a disadvantage, he said, as evidence shows the young and old are more vulnerable to developing PTSD. But if those around him are vigilant, any lasting effects can be mitigated. ""The other thing that is important is to make him feel in control,"" he said. ""What we did with the Beirut hostages was give them a watch. It was probably the first thing taken away from him -- and it would be one of the first things I'd give back, to give him a time reference for day or night."" It would be better if Shalit were kept away from the media for a few days, Busuttil said, in order for him to adjust before speaking publicly. Shalit may also feel a sense of dissociation after being kept in virtual isolation, he warned. While in captivity, Shalit had access some of the time to newspapers and to a radio, according to Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, but he was a young, apparently shy man cut off from all who knew him. Nothing is yet known of the personal resources Shalit found to keep hope alive during the years he was held by Hamas. But he may have found some comfort in the assurances given by Israel's military that it will always do its utmost to secure the return of its soldiers. ""The principle of returning POWs, MIAs, kidnapped and fallen IDF personnel has been sacrosanct since the IDF's inception in 1948,"" the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs website says. ""The IDF does all in its power to locate its captured personnel and free them."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated that commitment in his remarks after Shalit's release. Referring to his own military service, Netanyahu said: ""I always knew that if I or one of my comrades fell captive, the government of Israel would do its utmost to return us home, and as prime minister, I have now carried this out.  As a leader who daily sends out soldiers to defend Israeli citizens, I believe that mutual responsibility is no mere slogan -- it is a cornerstone of our existence here."" James Welsh, a researcher on health and detention for Amnesty International, told CNN there was good reason to be hopeful for Shalit's future well-being now he was back home. ""We shouldn't underestimate people's resilience,"" he said. ""There's a tendency to look on the gloomy side when we hear about people being released, but people do have amazing resources, so they can survive things quite well."" Of course, Shalit is not alone in celebrating his freedom Tuesday. The 477 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Shalit were also reunited with family and friends  -- many of them after long periods in detention. Hundreds more will be released in a second stage later this year. While the circumstances are not the same, those prisoners -- including hundreds serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis -- will also face a significant period of adjustment after their rapturous reception by tens of thousands of supporters in Gaza and elsewhere. Hamas official Hassan Youssef welcomed their release, but said it was not enough. ""We are all shedding two tears: One tear for the release of all of our fighters, and a tear of pain for all of our brothers still in prison,"" he said. Shalit's father, Noam, also reflected on the pain felt by Israelis who have watched those convicted of attacks on their loved ones leave jail early. Roxana Saberi, an Iranian-American journalist who was released four months into an eight-year jail term after being convicted of spying in Iran, offered some advice to freed American hikers Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal last month that may also be of use to Shalit as he seeks to make sense of his new reality. She urged them not to rush things, telling CNN: ""I hope that they are able to adapt well in this new part of their life and perhaps learned lessons in prison that can help them when they're free. ""I would tell them to take their time and not feel pressured to make decisions. This is their time. It's theirs again.""","Shalit's father says his son suffers the effects of old injuries but is happy to be home .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry has revealed a secret. The fourth in line to the throne unveiled a hidden fear Monday in support of the #FeelNoShame campaign being run by his Sentebale charity for World AIDS Day. Prince Harry co-founded the Sentebale charity with Lesotho's Prince Seeiso in 2006 after being struck by the impact of AIDS/HIV on children and young people in the southern African nation. Throughout the day, celebrities including singer Joss Stone, actor Charley Boorman, race car driver Daniel Ricciardo, and former rugby player and sport commentator Will Greenwood will be revealing secrets about themselves as part of #FeelNoShame. Television presenter Luke Franks has already revealed that he sometimes wears ladies' jeans -- for a better fit -- while footballer Christian Eriksen admitted eating all his advent calendar chocolates early. Wearing the red ribbon of the AIDS awareness campaign, Prince Harry revealed his secret in a video message released at 1 p.m. GMT. ""My secret is -- believe it or not -- I get incredibly nervous before public speaking, no matter how big the crowd or the audience and, um, despite the fact that I laugh and joke all the time I get incredibly nervous, if not anxious, actually, before going into rooms full of people when I'm wearing a suit,"" he said. ""And now that I've confessed that, I'll probably be even more worried that people are looking at me."" World AIDS Day has been held every December 1 since 1988 and is aimed at increasing awareness of the virus and raising funds to combat its effects. Prince Harry earlier posted a message on YouTube on behalf of Sentebale to mark World AIDS Day in which he said the virus was the No. 1 cause of death across Africa and second highest cause of death globally for those aged 10 to 19. ""One tragic issue in particular is the shame and stigma linked to HIV,"" he said. ""This causes thousands of children to needlessly die each year because they're keeping their illness a secret and not getting the medical attention that they need."" He said Sentebale encouraged children to talk openly about their health concerns. ""To show our support to the children of Lesotho and help reduce the stigma for all those affected by HIV, we are turning this World AIDS Day into a day in which no one should feel any shame about their secrets,"" Prince Harry said. ""Myself and many others will be sharing secrets of our own throughout the day and we ask everyone else to do the same. Please use the hashtag #FeelNoShame to share your secret on social media and show the children of Lesotho that they are not alone. ""Together we can tackle the stigma surrounding HIV and give the young people carrying it the treatment that they deserve -- the childhood so many of us take for granted.""","December 1 is World AIDS Day, which is aimed at raising awareness of the virus globally .

"(CNN) -- Just about six years after his career seemed to come to a crashing halt, when Barack Obama defeated him in the presidential election of 2008, Arizona Sen. John McCain is poised to re-emerge as a major player in the next two years. As the new chairman of the influential Armed Services Committee, McCain will be able to use this perch of power to loudly challenge the President's foreign policy agenda. Call it McCain's revenge. For several years, it seemed as if McCain was finished. The 2008 election delivered a huge blow to his political standing. Once considered the exciting maverick of Washington who could attract supporters from both parties, as a result of his pursuit of campaign finance reform and willingness to enter into bipartisan alliances, McCain won the award from many observers for running one of the worst campaigns ever. His attempt to cater to the right wing of the GOP and his selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate led many to question his political future. During much of Obama's presidency he seemed to struggle. He has often been at odds with members of his own party, including tea party Republicans who have pushed for a sharply rightward shift in domestic policy (and challenged him in the primary in 2010 when J.D. Hayworth ran again him), as well as anti-interventionists, such as Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul who have given strength to GOP rhetoric about limiting the scale and scope of the nation's national security operations. McCain has regained some of his footing by becoming the voice of the neoconservative Republicans, a group that many wrote off as a lost voice after the fiasco in Iraq. These members of GOP still believe the United States needs to maintain a muscular foreign policy and cannot afford to constrain national security operations. McCain has blasted Obama for not doing enough to combat the threat of ISIS. He has been a consistent critic of the decision to withdraw troops from Iraq. Of ISIS, he said in September, ""It was like watching a train wreck and warning every step of the way that this was happening."" Now that Republicans have retaken control of the Senate, McCain will be the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. This is an important post where he will have a chance to play a big role in debates over foreign policy. McCain made his intentions clear. He recently explained that, ""I want the committee to be very active. That's the beauty of the majority, as you know. Of course we can allocate and authorize certain programs, and we can cut others. The President proposes, and Congress disposes."" The resignation of Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has already offered him a chance to start saying what is on his mind. McCain has praised his former Senate colleague for his work at the Pentagon and said that Hagel was a victim of Obama's failed foreign policies. Hagel, McCain argued, was ""very, very frustrated with the administration."" When the nomination hearings begin to replace him, McCain will have an even greater opportunity to stand on his soap box and outline to the public everything that has gone wrong in the past six years. There will be other opportunities as well. As new crises flair in Syria and Iraq, the White House must make decisions about troop levels. McCain will have a chance to reiterate his claims about how a passive White House has endangered the national security interest and created too much space for radical elements overseas to gain a stronger foothold in the Middle East. In the debates over the budget, McCain will try to reverse the military spending cuts that the president has put into place. Next summer, when Congress has to reauthorize a key part of the Patriot Act dealing with surveillance, the senator will be able to push back against members of his own party as well as Democrats who think that the answer to the problems is to weaken the ability of the government to spy on potential threats with phone and email surveillance. McCain, who is expecting a tea party challenge for his re-election bid in 2016, is going to have a huge incentive to be aggressive in promoting himself as a major player in the GOP and crafting a conservative agenda that he can feel comfortable with (unlike when he did this in 2008 on domestic issues and looked as fake as a bad Hollywood actor). McCain's new platform will create a challenge, not only for the President, but for Hillary Clinton, assuming she runs for the presidency in 2016. Given Clinton's service as Secretary of State, she won't be able to escape her connections to the President's record. Clinton will surely try to make distinctions, as she did in her book ""Hard Choices"" when she reminded Americans she wanted a more aggressive stand in Syria, but ultimately she will be judged on Obama's record because she was a key player in this administration. The more aggressive that McCain is during the coming years, the more Clinton will have to respond to his agenda. Reports of McCain's political death were greatly exaggerated, to paraphrase Mark Twain. McCain is back. And Democrats had better watch out.","Julian Zelizer: Sen. John McCain is poised to re-emerge as a major player in the next two years .

"Police militarization — the issue that briefly united conservatives and liberals over Ferguson — has turned out to be a dud. A White House review suggests largely leaving intact federal programs that provide surplus military equipment to local police departments. President Barack Obama ordered the review after widely criticized heavy-handed police response to August protests following the shooting of Michael Brown. A report released by the White House on Monday suggested making improvements to the programs, to standardize training and better track equipment. But the White House response falls short of wholesale changes that some suggested should be made after police deployed military-style vehicles on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, after the Brown shooting. Efforts in Congress to rein in the programs have also fizzled. The White House report concluded: ""These programs, in the main, have been valuable and have provided state and local law enforcement with needed assistance as they carry out their critical missions in helping to keep the American people safe."" Between 2009 and 2014, the federal government has provided nearly $18 billion in funds and resources to support programs that provide equipment and tactical resources to state and local law enforcement. The vast majority of that money goes to back office equipment, with only 4 percent of property going to heavier, more controlled equipment. Police tactical units in recent years have taken to wearing camouflage and some agencies have received heavy-duty battlefield vehicles known as MRAPs, an acronym for Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. What many saw as militarization, some law enforcement officials say, was what has come to be standard gear used by SWAT teams, which aren't routinely deployed on civilian streets. Some law enforcement officials say that instead of focusing on equipment, more attention should be paid to police training. Justice Department officials have pushed for improved training for St. Louis-area police agencies, moving away from ""warrior"" tendencies and toward being ""guardians"" for communities that police serve. The White House report released Monday suggested standardizing training for police to respect civil rights and liberties. The president plans to issue an executive order to tighten some of the controls over the programs to better track equipment provided to law enforcement agencies. The White House also plans to boost funding to pay for 50,000 body cameras for police officers.","White House review largely leaves intact federal programs that provide police with surplus military equipment .

"The U.S. Supreme Court considered Monday where to draw the line in protecting free speech on social media sites like Facebook. The Court heard arguments in the case of a Pennslvania man convicted of making threatening statements about his estranged wife and law enforcement officials. Anthony Elonis claims he did not intend to frighten anyone, that instead his writings were ""therapeutic"" and helped him deal with the sadness of his broken marriage. Elonis' attorney, John Elwood, told the high court the government must prove he intended to instill fear in others and make them feel threatened. ""If he knows [his wife] is in fear he does not have the right to carry on,"" Elwood said. Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, arguing for the government, told the justices that it does not matter what Elonis intended, only whether a reasonable person would have felt threatened. Dreeben said, ""We want a standard to hold people accountable.""  Arguing against the rap defenses, Dreeben argued in the context of rap lyrics, like those of rapper Eminem, ""the clear purpose is entertainment."" The justices questions suggested the case presents a struggle about what is a threat and what is just self-expression. Chief Justice John Roberts questioned Dreeben using the example of someone who is not yet known as a rapper and therefore has no clear purpose of entertainment, asking, ""What about the budding rapper who is writing his first rap song?"" Justice Samuel Alito commented, ""This sounds like a road map for threatening a spouse and getting away with it. So you put it in a rhyme...and you say I'm an aspiring rap artist and so then you are free from prosecution."" Justice Sonya Sotomayor said, ""We've been loathe to create more exceptions to the First Amendment."" Elonis was convicted of threatening to injure another person and sentenced to nearly four years in prison for posting writings such as, ""There's one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you. I'm not going to rest until your body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts."" Elonis claims he was just writing rap lyrics and venting. He also posted comments about law enforcement, writing, ""I've got enough explosives to take care of the state police and the sheriff's department."" In yet another Facebook posting Elonis writes about making a name for himself by shooting up a local kindergarten class. Elonis wrote, ""Enough elementary schools in a ten mile radius to initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined. And hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a kindergarten class."" The case is Elonis v. United States, 13-983.","The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Monday on a case examining free speech and social media .

"(CNN) -- It may have taken a while, but travelers struggling to get home after Thanksgiving weekend will get to sleep in their own beds soon. After more than 4,000 U.S. flights were delayed and 244 were canceled Sunday -- one of the busiest travel days of the year -- airports should be much less chaotic Monday. As of early Monday morning, about 130 flights were delayed and 22 were canceled, according to FlightAware.com. Air travelers Monday probably won't see a repeat of the enormous lines like one at Chicago Midway International Airport. There, the line for security screening got so bad that reporter Denise Whitaker of CNN affiliate KOMO measured it: 1.2 miles. So what caused this? ""This happens sometimes,"" Chicago Aviation Department spokeswoman Karen Pride said, according to CNN affiliate WLS. She said that between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. Sunday, lines were long because ""that is when most people are traveling for the holiday period."" But weather didn't play a big role at many major airports. Sure, snow snarled traffic for parts of the country on Wednesday, but conditions were much better Sunday in many areas. Chicago had temperatures in the upper 40s in Chicago. Denver, however, did get hit with bad weather. About 50 flights to Denver International Airport were diverted due to heavy fog, CNN affiliate KMGH reported. ""It's going to take some time to catch up from this weather,"" airport spokeswoman Laura Coale told KMGH on Sunday. While a lot of attention goes to the airports -- where the interconnected flight travel system can have a domino effect -- the vast majority of Thanksgiving travelers hit the road. Ninety percent of travelers were expected to go by road, AAA predicted, helped by the lowest gas prices in five years. In all, more than 46 million people were expected to travel 50 miles or more for Thanksgiving, marking the highest volume since 2007. ""The average distance traveled this Thanksgiving will be 549 miles roundtrip, and Americans will spend an average of $573 during the holiday weekend,"" AAA predicted. How's your holiday travel going? Join the conversation on Facebook. CNN's Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.","About 130 flights are delayed and 22 are canceled as of early Monday morning .

"Oreo lovers have long debated how to eat them:  twisted, dunked, creme first or bite whole. But most have never calculated just how stuffed Oreos are, until now . A high school math teacher in upstate New York tasked his students to find out just how much ""stuf"" is in each type of Oreo -- original, Double and Mega Stuf. ""Most of them have had practice, as have I, in separating the Oreo in half and getting a clean side, but getting two clean sides off just leaving the stuff was difficult,"" said teacher Dan Anderson. Oreo: Original vs. Double vs. Mega . Here's how they did it. The students weighed 10 of each type of sandwich cookie -- original, Double and Mega.  They also weighed the wafers separately, without the creme . Subtract the weight of the wafer from the total weight of the cookie, and you get the stuff! The results:  shocking, if you can say such a thing about a cookie revelation. Anderson's students discovered that those cookies we love so much, aren't all they're stuffed up to be. Double Stuf?  Not really.  Try 1.86 times the stuff of a regular Oreo.  Mega Stuf?  Try again.  How about 2.68 times the stuff. ""We were very surprised,"" Anderson said. And it apparently would be a surprise to the folks at Oreo too. ""While I'm not familiar with what was done in the classroom setting, I can confirm for you that our recipe for the Oreo Double Stuf cookie has double the stuff, or creme filling, when compared with our base, or original Oreo cookie,"" said Oreo spokeswoman Kimberly Fontes. This isn't the first time a food favorite has come under fire for not measuring up. Watch:  Subway's footlong doesn't add up . Last year a Subway customer's photo went viral. It showed his foot-long sub only measured 11 inches. Subway said at the time that foot-long was ""a descriptive name for the sub and not intended to be a measurement of length.""","An Oreo Double Stuf is 1.86 times bigger, math students find .

"It just took a little push to topple the delicately perched boulder -- millions of years in the making -- in Utah's Goblin Valley State Park. Then the man who did it laughed, high-fived his son, and flexed his muscles while being cheered on by a fellow Boy Scout leader. He is not likely celebrating now, nor is his friend who videotaped then publicized the episode, after both were charged Friday with third-degree felonies. Glenn Taylor, who pushed over the rock, and the cameraman, David Hall, face charges of criminal mischief and are accused of intentionally damaging, defacing and destroying property, according to the charging document. Neither man could be reached by CNN on Friday for comment on the charges. But both have previously defended their actions in interviews with CNN affiliate KUTV, saying they had done a good thing by pushing over a precarious rock that could have otherwise fallen on a passer-by. ""That wasn't going to last very long at all,"" Hall has said, saying then he would ""absolutely"" support doing it again. ""One gust of wind and a family's dead."" 'We have now modified Goblin Valley' The men likely wouldn't have been charged if not for the Internet -- specifically, the video Hall shot inside the sparse state park and posted to YouTube, then linked up on Facebook. In it, Taylor is seen behind one of the many unique, ancient rocks in the park, his arm outstretched. ""Wiggle it, just a little bit,"" sang Hall, the cameraman, mimicking a pop song. Soon after, Hall yells out ""boom"" then ""yeah"" as the rock tumbles down. ""We have now modified Goblin Valley,"" the cameraman jokes, crediting ""muscles over here."" ""Some little kid was about to walk down here and die, and Glenn saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way. It's all about saving lives here at Goblin Valley."" Authorities, apparently, didn't get the joke or appreciate the life-saving intentions. In the days after the incident went viral, park officials suggested the men broke the law by defacing a state park. Jeff Rasmussen, the deputy director of Utah State Parks and Recreation, said that in his 22 years on the job he hadn't heard of any goblins -- the moniker for the distinctive rock formation that Taylor toppled -- rolling off their pedestals. ""Obviously, we're very concerned and upset that somebody would come and destroy this natural wonder that took millions of years to be formed,"" Rasmussen told KUTV. Strong reaction to video online . This wasn't just any old rock. Created over millions of years by windblown dust and moving water, the distinct boulder that Taylor toppled had been perched gracefully atop a slender rock pedestal. It was one of thousands dotting the southern Utah valley, surrounded by a wall of eroded sandstone cliffs. In mid-October, Taylor and Hall were among those leading a Boy Scout group through the distinctive park that is touted online as ""a showcase of geologic history."" Hall  told KUTV that the men did what they did because the boulder in question seemed unstable. The man who did the pushing, Taylor, admitted regretfully to the same station that he wished they'd alerted a park ranger about the perceived danger because ""it was wrong of us to be vigilantes."" At the same time, he defended their intent. ""We thought we were doing a good deed,"" Taylor said. It's not just the ""deed"" but the celebration that bothered Eugene Swalberg, a Utah State Parks official. ""It gives you a pit in your stomach,"" Swalberg told CNN last fall. ""There seems to be a lot of happiness and joy with the individuals doing this, and it's not right. This is not what you do at a natural scenic area."" The Boy Scouts apparently weren't fond of what happened either. The National Boy Scouts of America and the organization's Utah National Parks Council issued almost simultaneous, similar statements in October dismissing those involved not only from their leadership roles but also from the Scouts entirely. Boulder pushers get booted by Boy Scouts . Many who saw the video online echoed that disgust, like one with the user name Drc0ffee, who blasted ""idiots pushing meaningless boulders around for a 'good' reason or just for s**** and jiggles."" But the boulder busters got support, too, from some who agreed it appeared to be a safety hazard. Others were indifferent, like Alex Milburn. ""It's a rock,"" he said. ""Why is everyone freaking out?""","Glenn Taylor and David Hall face felony charges of criminal mischief .

"(CNN) -- MySpace.com has identified and removed 90,000 convicted sex offenders from its popular social-networking site, according to one of the dozens of state attorneys general who pressured the site to beef up its safety standards. MySpace.com's chief security officer said in 2007 that the site has ""zero tolerance for sexual predators."" Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who spearheaded the campaign to subpoena MySpace, told CNN Radio that he found the number ""appalling."" ""These convicted, registered sex offenders clearly create profiles seeking to prey on children,"" he said. ""This revelation is totally appalling and unacceptable, and this shocking revelation, resulting from our subpoena, also provides compelling proof that social networking sites remain ripe with sexual predators."" MySpace's chief security officer, Hemanshu Nigam, issued a statement: ""As the first and only social networking site to use state of the art technology to identify and remove registered sex offenders from its site, MySpace is proud of its leadership position and hopes that Facebook follows our lead in providing their members with the same protections. As part of our longstanding partnership with law enforcement and state attorneys general, we will continue to readily provide information on these removed offenders for their investigations."" In May, MySpace announced that it would provide the coalition of state attorneys general with information on sex offenders who use the site. ""We have zero tolerance for sexual predators on MySpace,"" Nigam said at the time, as he introduced a tool known as Sentinel SAFE to track online sex offenders.

"(CNN)Uber's route to the top has been pockmarked with scandal, from its acrobatic approach to transport regulations to the alleged misogyny of CEO Travis Kalanick. But fresh claims that the company puts journalists and users under surveillance, and appropriates their data, could pose an existential threat. The taxi-disrupting service has faced a severe backlash, with analysts and bloggers excoriating the company culture, and the viral campaign #deleteuber thriving across social platforms. In response to the battering, the ""most arrogant startup in Silicon Valley"" has been forced onto the defensive. Representatives are emphasizing customer care and community values at the heart of their mission, breaking with their ruthless image. But if bad publicity has darkened Uber's name it has not damaged its performance. After its latest round of funding, the company is valued at around $40 billion, and the service has expanded its availability from 60 cities in 2013 to over 200 today. ""At this point it's a reputation crisis but is not specific to the job they are doing,"" says Dr. Audra Diers-Lawson, a specialist in crisis management at the University of Manchester. ""The reason Uber is still growing is that people still view them as a good service. If there was a problem with the rides we would see a much more immediate effect."" Audra compares the situation with BP's plummeting stock in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico spill -- ""a material crisis, related to their primary function"" -- that is still depressing the company's performance several years later. Uber's crisis is far from unique. In a digital age, reputation has never been harder to safeguard. ""Social media has made the world more transparent so bad news travels faster and spreads further,"" says Jonathan Hemus, founder of reputation management company Insignia Communications. ""I would say reputation risk is higher than ever before."" Given the volume of online opinion, much of it from anonymous critics that could be trolls or competitors in disguise, companies need not always take heed of it. ""Sometimes its better to let it go away,"" says Justin Fox, executive editor of the Harvard Business Review. ""Large, established organizations can ignore petty complaints but must decide who to pay attention to. Every company checks the Klout of its critics."" In some cases, companies have chosen to court controversy and prospered, such as with Ryanair and its combative Chief Executive Michael O' Leary who has often seemed to relish confrontation but posted record profits nonetheless. ""It seems negative but is consistent with the image they want,"" says Fox. Even spats over charging customers for water or toilet use is ""still spreading the message 'we are really cheap'."" A bad reputation can be a blessing says Noel Biderman, CEO of Ashley Madison, a matchmaking service for married people that is thriving despite more opprobrium than Uber has yet faced. The self-styled ""King of Infidelity"" empathizes with their situation. ""If you're a disruptive business shaking up an existing paradigm you know you will get flak, and you need to have your story straight. Ours is about shifting values in society and in people's behavior."" ""Actors from mainstream TV shows are often told 'go and create controversy, let people see your flaws.' It gives them an edge. It can be the same for a company."" A pristine reputation may also be of lesser importance to larger brands, that are better insulated against reputation damage. Department stores such as Wal-Mart and Asda have been regular targets for consumer campaigns, but have continued to thrive through their ability to undercut competitors with lower priced goods. Monsanto have also shown that a dominant position in the market can compensate for negative impressions. But such respite is only temporary, says Jonathan Hemus. Eventually a bad reputation will catch up with any business. ""In the longer term, no business can afford to maintain a negative reputation. Most successful businesses combine a fantastic product and service with strong, positive reputations and relationships."" ""It's possible to recover a reputation, which depends on rebuilding trust and confidence...you have to address the root cause of a problem, and prove you're taking action to stop it happening."" For Uber, there are numerous threats on the horizon that could make an image problem into a wholesale crisis, including tightened regulations, disgruntled drivers, and competitors such as Lyft that can trade off a comparatively friendly reputation. So can they turn it around? ""Not with this leadership,"" says Audra Diers-Lawson. ""The first thing they need is a new CEO."" Read more: why your business wont grow without a virtual assistant .

"(CNN) -- Having been stuck in Qatar for two years over a pay dispute, soccer player Zahir Belounis is relieved that the nightmare is finally over. The French-Algerian arrived back in Paris on Thursday with his wife and two daughters after an ordeal that he says left him suffering with depression and contemplating suicide. ""I am so happy. I'm feeling so much stronger,"" the 33-year-old told CNN as he was met by gathered family, friends and media at Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle airport. ""This is not the end of the fight though. I'm happy to be home and have a normal life again."" Qatar has come under intense media scrutiny since winning the right to stage the 2022 World Cup, particularly over its employment laws -- notably the kafala system, which requires expatriate workers and some visitors to have a residence permit. Belounis was met at the airport by Abdeslam Ouaddou, another player who found himself in a dispute with a Qatar club and who has taken his case to football's governing body FIFA. ""I am so happy for Zahir to come home but the real victory will be when the kafala system ends,"" said Ouaddou, a Moroccan who played for several French clubs and England's Fulham before moving to the emirate in 2010. ""If they don't change kafala then they should change where the World Cup is,"" Ouaddou told CNN. The Belounis case has prompted the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) to demand a change to workers' rights in Qatar. ITUC general secretary Sharan Burrow said in a statement that Belounis' case has ""come to illustrate the conditions faced by 1.3 million migrant workers in Qatar."" ""The torment that Zahir and his family have been put through because of bad laws which give workers no rights should never be repeated,"" she said. ""Sadly, today in Qatar there remain many workers who have no voice. The Qatar authorities should reform their laws to respect International Labor Organization conditions."" FIFPro, the global players' union, is set to visit Qatar this week for talks with the country's football authorities and organizers of the 2022 World Cup. Neither the Qatari Foreign Ministry nor the Qatari Football Association were available for comment, but in October the QFA told CNN that ""as in any other football association in the world, there will unfortunately always be contractual disputes between clubs and players/coaches."" It went on to add: ""It is also relevant to emphasize that up to now the player has not taken any action in front of the competent judicial bodies of FIFA. ""Our records show also that Zahir Belounis received salaries from one of our other affiliated clubs, Al Markhiya Club, when he played there during the second half of the 2011/12 season. ""At the end of that season, Zahir Belounis contacted the QFA for outstanding salaries from Al Markhiya Club. The QFA immediately took action and, after analysis and investigation which gave him right, the player received full compensation. ""However, in the alleged case of El Jaish Club, Zahir Belounis did not contact QFA, although he had experienced the efficiency of doing so when his request was legitimate."" On Tuesday, FIFA president Sepp Blatter condemned European media for ""attacking"" and ""criticizing"" Qatar. ""It is not fair when the international media and especially European media are taking up the focus of an Arab country here in Asia, and attacking, criticizing this country,"" Blatter said to delegates at the Asian Football Confederation awards in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ""We are defending it. We have taken the decision to play a World Cup in the Arab world and we have taken the decision to play in Qatar and we will go and play this ... in 2022 in Qatar,"" Blatter added. Earlier this month, he condemned working conditions in Qatar as ""unacceptable"" following an Amnesty International report which claimed migrant worker abuse was rife. But for now, at least, the Belounis family can celebrate being home and together again. Zahir's brother Mahdi, who met him at the airport with their mother, tweeted updates of the situation as he campaigned for his sibling's freedom. And Zahir's wife Johanna is now looking forward to resuming a normal life. ""We arrived back with just six bags but we have our freedoms,"" she said. ""I am so happy we will have our lives back. He is so much better now. The girls are happy. We are free.""","Zahir Belounis returns to Paris with his family after finally leaving Qatar .

"An apartment building in the North Korean capital collapsed in what state media described as a ""serious accident"" that caused an unspecified number of casualties. The unusual, apologetic report Sunday from the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the collapse took place Tuesday at the construction site of an apartment building in Phyongchon, a central district of Pyongyang. ""The accident claimed casualties,"" the agency reported without providing details on the number of people killed and injured. Rescue efforts were abandoned on Saturday, the agency said. A South Korean government official said the building had 23 floors, estimating that as many as 92 families might have been living inside. It's common for people to move into North Korean buildings before construction is completed, the official said. The South Korean government closely monitors activities in North Korea. The construction of the building ""was not done properly and officials supervised and controlled it in an irresponsible manner,"" KCNA reported. Pyongyang residents were ""greatly shocked"" it said. Kim Jong Un upset . The secretive North Korean regime rarely calls attention to problems within its borders. The publication of the state media report, which contained a series of apologies from senior public officials, suggests it was a severe calamity. Kim Jong Un, the country's leader, ""sat up all night, feeling painful after being told about the accident"" and put aside ""all other affairs,"" KCNA reported, citing Kim Su Gil, the chief secretary of the Pyongyang City Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea. Minister of People's Security Choe Pu Il described the accident as ""unimaginable,"" according to the news agency. Kim Su Gil said authorities are taking steps to help the families of the victims and provide them with new housing, supporting the conclusion that people were living in the building while it was still under construction. Among the disasters that North Korea has taken the rare step of acknowledging publicly are floods in 2012 that killed scores of people and an explosion at a train station in 2004 that caused hundreds of casualties.","Dozens of families may have been in the building, a South Korean official says .

"A Palestinian teenage girl with a knife assaulted an Israeli man Monday in the West Bank, adding another attack to a chain of ethnic violence. At least 10 Israelis have died in attacks since October. A young Palestinian girl was also reportedly killed in ethnic violence. Israeli security officers opened fire on the Palestinian teenager. She sustained ""serious injuries,"" Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. The girl was taken to a hospital. The stabbing victim was ""lightly wounded"" near the cluster of Jewish settlements of Gush Etzion, Israel Defense Forces said. In recent weeks, Palestinian attackers killed and injured Israelis in gun, knife and car attacks. Israeli police have responded by shooting dead most of the alleged assailants. Authorities said Monday they are investigating an incident involving a vehicle that struck an Israeli citizen at the Alon junction on the West Bank. The 50-year-old man is in serious condition in Tel HaShomer Hospital in Tel Aviv. A slew of attacks . Here is a look at a few recent acts of violence: . • Two Palestinian cousins stormed a Jerusalem synagogue in mid-November with a gun and butcher's knives, killing five. They were shot dead by police. • Days later, Israeli authorities said they foiled a plot by Palestinians to assassinate Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. • More than a week earlier, attackers stabbed one Israeli soldier to death in Tel Aviv and three more Israelis near a West Bank settlement, the IDF said. One of the West Bank victims also died. • In early November, a Palestinian man driving a van plowed into pedestrians at a train stop in eastern Jerusalem, killing two. Another 12 people were injured. The man died in police gunfire after also attacking people with a metal bar, police said. • In October, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. The driver of the vehicle was shot as he tried to flee and later died. • Also in October, according to a Palestinian state news report, an Israeli man killed a 5-year-old Palestinian girl when he ran her down in a car as she walked home from kindergarten. The attack reportedly also injured a second 5-year-old girl. Tensions over the killings of Israeli teens and Palestinian boys marked the run-up to the military conflict  in Gaza between Israel and Hamas this summer, which took dozens of Israeli lives and more than 2,100 Palestinian lives.","A Palestinian girl attacks an Israeli man in the West Bank, police say .

"(CNN) -- Not many businessmen can claim the superstar status of Carlos Ghosn. But then not many businessmen are at the helm of not one, but two of the world's biggest car makers. Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn smiles at the Monaco Formula One Grand Prix on May 25, 2008. Brazilian-born Ghosn has not always been a superstar in Japan. When he arrived in Tokyo in 1999 to revive the fortunes of Nissan, he took plenty of flak after slashing more than 20,000 jobs and closing assembly plants. But when his ""Nissan Revival Plan"" worked -- he resurrected the car maker from near bankruptcy a year earlier than scheduled -- he became a hero. These days Ghosn gets the sort of adulation in Japan normally reserved for rock stars and football players. He is often mobbed by fans in search of an autograph and has even been portrayed as a manga comic book superhero in ""The True Story of Carlos Ghosn."" His face has graced the covers of Japanese business magazines, he is the subject of a handful of books and has even written his own. Ghosn was born on March 9, 1954, to Lebanese parents. His family moved to Lebanon when he was a toddler, and he later studied engineering at Ecole Polytechnique and Ecole des Mines de Paris in France, where he is a citizen. Fluent in French, Arabic, English and Portuguese -- and quickly catching up in Japanese -- Ghosn is the quintessential international businessman. His career in the auto industry began in 1978 at Europe's largest tiremaker, Michelin, where he worked for 18 years, moving up the ranks from plant manager to chief operating officer. He headed both Michelin's South American and North American units during his tenure with the company, achieving success at both. He joined Renault in 1996 as executive vice president, and was sent to Japan to revive Nissan three years later. Since May 2005, all the while staying at the helm of Nissan, he has taken the reins of French car company Renault, which owns 44 percent of Nissan. The man dubbed ""Samurai"" and ""Le Cost Killer"" for his reputation for restructuring companies is not only CEO and president of Nissan and Renault, he is also on the board of Alcoa, Sony and IBM. Running two of the world's biggest car companies means splitting his time between Paris and Tokyo and fitting in meetings, visits to plants and dealerships, as well as attending car shows all over the world and catalyzing spectacular model launches. But despite his busy lifestyle, it is not all business for Ghosn. Married to wife Rita, whom he met 22 years ago in France, the couple have four children -- Caroline, Nadine, Maya and Anthony -- and Ghosn is known for making time to spend with his family. And at Nissan's new Advanced Technology Center in Yokohama, Japan, all employees are asked to leave the building each day no later than 8 p.m., so as to avoid sombering into workaholism. He's revived the fortunes of Japan's second biggest car maker, was named Man of the Year in 2002 by French magazine Le Journal de l'Automobile and Businessman of the Year by Fortune magazine the same year. But he has said his most cherished titled is being named Father of the Year by a Japanese community group in 2001.","Ghosn resurrected Nissan from near bankruptcy after taking over in 1999 .

"Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said Gov. Chris Christie's veto of a ban that would have prohibited the use of pig gestation crates in New Jersey was a ""good decision."" According to the Des Moines Register, Branstad said in his weekly press conference Monday that he personally lobbied for Christie to not sign the measure, arguing that people in New Jersey don't understand the issue. While animal rights activists and supporters of the ban say the crates are cruel -- pregnant sows can't turn around in the limited space -- advocates like Branstad argue the crates help keep sows separated from smaller piglets that are at risk of being stepped on and killed. ""This is an issue that most people in New Jersey have no clue,"" Branstad said. ""They don't raise hardly any pigs in New Jersey, they don't have farrowing crates. But this is something we do have knowledge of in Iowa, and I give him credit for listening to and understanding that this is something we're very concerned about and that does impact consumers as well because if these baby pigs are crushed and die that means there are fewer pigs and that impacts the price of pork."" By comparison, New Jersey has far fewer pigs (9,000) compared to Iowa, the county's largest pork producer with 20.5 million, according to the USDA. Iowa is also a state that holds enormous influence in the 2016 presidential election given its status as the first-in-the-nation nominating state -- thus a politically important state for Christie should he decide to make a White House bid. ""I did share with Gov. Christie my personal experience and my interest in this and that of Iowa Farm Bureau and the National Pork Producers, all of which are headquartered here in Iowa,"" Branstad said. Christie said he vetoed the bill because it was a ""solution in search of a problem"" and a ""political movement masquerading as substantive policy."" Such decisions, he argued, should be made by the state's Board of Agriculture, which currently doesn't outlaw the crates. In his comments Monday, Branstad appeared to be conflating gestation crates with farrowing gates, which keep pigs separated from piglets after giving birth but still allows access for nursing. It's an argument that's been pushed by other opponents of gestation bans. ""It's stunning that the governor of Iowa is so unfamiliar with pig farming that he doesn't know the difference between gestation crates and farrowing crates,"" said Paul Shapiro, vice president of Farm Animal Protection at the Humane Society of the United States. ""This bill applied only to gestation crates, meaning there are no piglets to be kept separate from their mothers, since they're all in utero,"" he told CNN. The Humane Society, which helped push the New Jersey bill and advocates for group housing for sows, argue that pig farmers use the crates simply to cram as many pigs into one facility as possible. Dave Warner, spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, acknowledged that farrowing crates -- not gestation crates -- are used to prevent sows from stepping on piglets, and said someone who makes comments like Branstad's are ""just mixing them up."" He said group housing can result in aggression between pigs, and gestation crates help protect adult pigs from each other. He added it's true that the crates help provide space for slightly more pigs in a facility but argued ""there's nothing inhumane about them."" Because of the crates, he said, farmers and veterinarians have better access to provide daily monitoring and care for the pigs, making them healthier.","New Jersey Gov.

"White House officials are scratching their heads over the decision by Republicans to sue President Barack Obama over his decision to delay a requirement in the health care law for businesses to provide coverage to employees. That's because, as one senior administration official pointed out on Friday, those same lawmakers voted to do the exact same thing at virtually the exact same time -- defer until 2015 the part of Obamacare known as the employer mandate. House Speaker John Boehner justified last July's vote, held days after the Obama administration action, as a repudiation of the executive decision to alter a major part of the politically-charged law just months before it was put into practice. ""I get to look at the Constitution once in a while. The Constitution makes it clear that Congress writes the law, and the President takes the oath of office to faithfully discharge the laws that are on the books,"" Boehner said. The House voted separately to delay the Obamacare individual mandate as well, another centerpiece of the landmark 2010 law that remains in place and requires everyday Americans to have some kind of health insurance. Both the business and individual mandates required compliance to avoid possible fines. The two House votes drew significant Democratic support but the Democratic-led Senate didn't take up either. Obamacare fight continues . The reference to last year's vote by the Republican-led House signals White House confidence that Boehner's lawsuit announced on Thursday night will fail in court. House Republicans tried to use their constitutional powers to delay the mandate but failed, the White House thinking goes. Boehner consulted legal experts before announcing the action and CNN's Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh reported that they were advised that keeping the focus of any legal challenge narrow offered the best chance to succeed in court. The suit first must be authorized by legislation before being submitted in federal court by private attorneys. The timing of a court filing is unclear. Obamacare is the signature domestic policy achievement of Obama's presidency so far. It's aimed at fulfilling his promise to make health care coverage available to millions without it. Since October, the administration says 9 million people have signed up for a range of policies through federal and state insurance markets. But it has also been a bitter partisan flashpoint since its approval in 2010 without GOP support. Republicans have made it a focus of their sharp political attacks on Obama and Democrats ahead of November's midterms with control of the Senate at stake. ""In terms of politics, there is no issue that Republicans have the best chance of riling up the base than Obamacare,"" Bash said. The case also magnifies a toxic partisan climate that has engulfed Congress overall and come to define Obama's relations with Republicans in general. Some arch-conservatives in the party want him impeached. Pushing forward . Boehner doesn't agree with such a step, but he's plowing ahead with an unusual legal challenge built around Republican claims Obama has abused his authority at the expense of the legislative process. Obama defiantly challenged Republicans last week, saying he would continue to take steps he felt were necessary with or without the support of congressional Republicans. ""So sue me,"" he dared them. White House spokesman Josh Earnest quickly dismissed Boehner's decision to take his case court as a ""political stunt."" The President ""is doing his job -- lawsuit or not -- and it's time Republicans in Congress did theirs,"" Earnest said in a statement. Boehner argued the employer mandate delay is the best legal avenue for his case against Republican claims that Obama has overstepped his executive authority in carrying out his priorities. ""In 2013, the President changed the health care law without a vote of Congress, effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it,"" Boehner said in a statement Thursday. ""That's not the way our system of government was designed to work.  No president should have the power to make laws on his or her own,"" Boehner said. House Republicans point to the support they received from constitutional scholars who testified on the Obamacare mandate delay last December. Obama overreach? At a House Judiciary Committee hearing, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, a once fierce critic of the Bush administration, suggested Obama overreached. ""The President is required to faithfully execute the laws. He's not required to enforce all laws equally or commit the same resources to them,"" he said. ""But I believe the President has crossed the constitutional line."" Administration officials have repeatedly argued that alterations to the Affordable Care Act are legal. In February 2013, a Treasury Department spokeswoman told Government Executive the administration has the power to delay the employer mandate and its fines, which are in essence taxes on businesses that do not comply with the law. The taxing authority of the federal government was the legal underpinning of the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the sweeping health law and its individual mandate in 2012. But other legal experts have already said any lawsuit around executive authority would face challenges. In order for it to be formally considered by the courts, House Republicans must prove that the chamber was somehow injured as an institution.

""Ghost"" soldiers are members of the armed forces, who pay off their commanders with a portion of their salaries, so they don't have to man their posts. ""Only by checking paperwork, I managed during this month to eliminate 50,000 ghost soldiers in four Iraqi army divisions,"" Haider al-Abadi said. Lawmakers erupted in shouts at his announcement. Investigators are looking for additional cases, and al-Abadi expects many more to turn up.

"Hillary Clinton will likely run for president of the United States. But forgive the U.S.'s neighbors to the North for thinking the former secretary of state is considering a bid at prime minster, too. Since leaving the State Department in 2013, Hillary Clinton has headlined six events in Canada and organizers in the country announced two more appearances in two different provinces on Monday. Clinton will speak at an event in Winnipeg, Manitoba sponsored by CIBC, a large bank in Canada, on January 21, 2015, according to this ticket page. That same day, Clinton will speak at a similar event - also sponsored by CIBC, in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, according to a press release. The opportunities in Canada not only allow her to make money off of speaker fees, but it gives her a platform to discuss global affairs and her time running the State Department, a subject she's pretty comfortable revisiting. With the addition of these appearances, Clinton has now headlined events in six of Canada's ten provinces (the country also has three territories). Her other appearances include: .

Most have been promoted and organized by TINEPUBLIC, a special events and conference organizer in Canada. CNN's calls to the group went unanswered on Monday. One thing is consistent for nearly every event Clinton does in Canada: At some point, she is asked about the Keystone XL pipeline. At her June event in Edmonton, Clinton gave hope to both sides of the debate over the 1,179-mile-long project that would move oil from Canada to refineries in the United States, but declined to comment on whether she would approve the project or not. ""I do believe that both Canada and the United States can become even richer, more prosperous, but also more environmentally sustainable by having a broad engagement over energy and climate and not focusing everything on this one decision,"" Clinton said. Obviously, if Clinton runs for president in 2016, she will not be able to take money from Canadians or win a non-existent Canadian primary. But after her visit to Ottawa in October, one headline pointed to the fact that Clinton's visit may be more than that: ""Hillary Clinton winning hearts, if not voters, in Ottawa"".","Clinton announced Monday two events in Canada that will take place early next year .
After those 2 events, Clinton will have headlined events in 60% of Canada's provinces .
The events offer Clinton a chance to talk about her experience running the State department ."
"(CNN)Rising wages, sagging property prices, inflation: all of China's indicators point to a slowdown of its powerhouse economy in 2015. After decades of double-digit growth, China slumped back into single digits in 2012 as stimulus money from the global financial crisis began to dry up. With the latest GDP figures showing growth of just 7.3% (GDP growth regularly stood around 11% in the lead up to 2008) the September quarter of 2014 was one of the slowest since the crisis. Analysts said China may even fail to hit its targets for the first time. While these problems may be giving Beijing pause for thought, for China's regional neighbors in Cambodia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Laos and beyond, a China slump is good news. Cheaper labor . Not only is the rising cost of the Chinese workforce pushing many manufacturers to seek cheaper labor offshore, but China's slackening demand for some natural resources has been a boon for the rest of South East Asia. Brent crude has fallen more than a third over the year, hitting a four-year low of US$76.76 a barrel this month. For countries in South East Asia that heavily subsidize energy to fuel their economies, the China slowdown is a welcome respite. ""Chinese garment manufacturers have been pouring into Asia's low-wage countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Bangladesh, accelerating these countries' industrialization and urbanization, and creating millions of new jobs,"" Doug Clayton of frontier investor Leopard Capital told CNN. It's a drift that is likely to benefit China's neighbors for some time to come, he said. ""This trend will continue until the surplus rural labor pool is mopped up and the wage gap narrows,"" continued Clayton. ""If China's wage inflation continues, (this situation) could last another 5-10 years at least."" Bright prospects . While the exporting economies in the region may take a hit in the short-term, he said the long-term picture is encouraging. ""Frontier markets tend to export commodities to China, so the falling resource prices hurt their rural economies,"" he said. ""On a macro level, however, lower oil prices help offset the pain, since most frontier economies are oil importers."" China's planned economy, too, also means that Beijing looks at its economic prospects in terms of decades rather than financial quarters. ""China's appetite for financing and building infrastructure projects across its borders seems undiminished by its economic slowdown,"" Clayton said. ""The country's leaders have a long-term viewpoint and see strategic benefits in opening new markets and expanding prosperity in countries within its sphere of influence. ""These mega-projects also help employ surplus Chinese workers and showcase China's engineering capabilities."" China still growing . For many analysts, however, China's economy is still on an upward trajectory despite concerns over credit bubbles, property slumps and general slowdowns. ""China's economy is slowing but it's still growing,"" Ben Simpfendorfer, founder and manager of Silk Road Associates, told CNN. ""It's larger than the combined value of Brazil, Russia or India's own GDPs. ""We spent the last few months speaking with regional CEOs from some of the world's biggest multinationals and they all say the same thing; yes the country is growing but it's growing in complexity."" He said it is important for investors to now segment their markets to make sure that a product or service is reaching the right people and the right geographies. ""If you're a bit more sophisticated in your approach, you can make good money in China."" Crucial reforms . Analysts say much will hinge on whether the government of Xi Jinping can institute bold and scheduled reforms to its highly regulated domestic capital markets and to interest rates. In the meantime, however, the landscape for the other emerging economies in the region has never been better, said Thomas Hugger CEO and Fund Manager for Asia Frontier Capital. ""Frontier markets have lower income and labor costs so countries in Asia like Vietnam, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, will benefit and it will have a dramatic impact in those societies or economies. ""More and more people go from the rural areas to the big  cities they start earning salaries, start consuming, start using medical services and healthcare and that's where we have a major focus when we invest."" He said the pendulum was now swinging in favor of other emerging markets in the Asia regions as they gained market share from China. ""The cycle started 40 or 50 years ago in Hong Kong, moved to Taiwan and then to China and now it's time to move to other places,"" he said. Read this: Asia's love affair with cosmetics .

"Flying above Kruger National Park, veterinarian Peter Buss steps out onto the helicopter's skid and aims his rifle; below him a white rhino lumbers across the South African bush. As the helicopter swoops in low, herding the animal closer to the road, Buss looks through the scope and fires a single shot. A flash of pink on the rump is all it takes to bring the two-ton animal staggering to the ground where fellow veterinarians are ready and waiting, armed with a blindfold. The Wildlife Veterinary Team works quickly: an oxygen tube is inserted into the subdued rhino's nostril. Blood, hair and skin samples are taken for DNA. Then, after another injection to partially reverse the effects of the tranquilizer, the rhino is pulled to its feet and led into a trailer for the journey to safer ground -- away from this poaching hotspot along the Mozambique border, to a recently established ""intensive protection zone"" deeper into the park. The team's members are no ordinary veterinarians, but daily captures like this one are quickly becoming the norm for a team tasked with the care of Kruger's most threatened species. They've already conducted more than 30 relocations since last month, and will conduct hundreds more. They are a key part of a protection plan which has taken on even greater urgency since the country's environmental minister announced that a record 1,020 of South Africa's rhinos have been poached this year. The illegal trade in rhino horn is fueled by an insatiable demand in Asia, where it is prized as a sign of wealth and believed to have medicinal value -- though there's no scientific evidence to support claims that it has healing properties. Rhino horn is made of keratin, the same protein found in human fingernails, but it can still fetch as much as $5,550 an ounce on the black market -- that's more than the price of gold, more than the price of platinum -- and roughly equivalent to the price of cocaine. Kruger National Park, which is home to roughly 10,000 rhinos -- a quarter of the world's population -- shares a 350-kilometer border with impoverished Mozambique, making it a massive target for poachers. ""We were rangers, now we're at war,"" the park's head of anti-poaching, Major General Johan Jooste, told CNN. But while new equipment and new technology has helped lead to a record number of poaching arrests this year, it has done little to slow the slaughter. The general says his enemy has a nearly limitless supply of foot soldiers ready to cross the border and risk it all for small slice of the profit: last month alone, 600 poachers infiltrated the park from Mozambique. ""Once a poacher is in the park, it's like a burglar in your home,"" said Jooste, who admitted that in a park the size of Israel, military-style patrols alone will never be enough to save Kruger's rhinos, and that much more needs to be done outside the park's boundaries. The intensive protection zones will at least give his rangers the chance to establish what the general calls sanctuaries within a sanctuary. ""We made the decision that we are here for the living rhino, not the dead,"" Jooste explained. There was a time when this park, famous and now targeted for its prized rhinos, had none. Several relocations, including one from 1960 to 1972 that introduced 300 rhinos, helped grow Kruger's population, which reached its peak of 12,200 rhinos in 2010. ""This is exactly what we've been doing for the last 30 years,"" said Markus Hofmeyr, head of veterinary services at Kruger about this latest round of relocations. ""Rhinos have recovered before."" Slaughtered for a horn that for millennia has been its first line of defense, conservationists are now counting on the rhino's extreme adaptability to save it from extinction.","A record 1,020 rhinos have been poached in South Africa in 2014 .

"A former Google+ employee who spent three years helping create Google+ has written a brutal blog post declaring the tech giant's social network a failure. In a lengthy, at times profane breakdown on blogging platform Medium, Chris Messina, the man credited as inventor of the hashtag, writes that Google missed a chance to make the service a one-stop home for its users' online identities and, instead, created a less-popular Facebook copycat. ""Lately, I just feel like Google+ is confused and adrift at sea,"" Messina wrote. ""It's so far behind, how can it possibly catch up?"" The November 28 post was a follow-up to a tweet in which he had mistakenly called out a bug on Google+ that was actually caused by an external app. Even as he corrected himself, he called out Google for the network's missed opportunity. ""I f---ed up,"" Messina wrote. ""So has Google."" Messina left Google over a year ago to join a startup. Before that, he had worked on the short-lived Google Buzz social product, then Google+. He wrote that while it was being developed under the code name ""Emerald Sea,"" Google+ was internally being called ""Google Me."" The idea at the time, he said, was to make the site a sort of home base for users, where they would decide which information they'd like to share about themselves and with whom they'd like to share it. ""It was like Google was saying, 'We're going to be your trusted partner in cyberspace, and we'll help you surface the right information to the people you choose, at the right time',"" Messina wrote. ""It was a functional search-oriented value proposition, rather than a social networking one. ""Thus, for me, when I searched for my mom's phone number on Google, I actually find it --  because it would be on her profile and she would have shared it with me. Suddenly a query like 'mom phone number' would work."" Instead, he wrote, Google+ became ""a kind of Facebook-lite."" ""Why did the world need another Facebook, unless to benefit Google by making their ad targeting more effective?"" Messina wrote. Google did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment for this article. Messina wrote that innovation appears to be slowing for the Web tool. In a chart, he said Google+ and Hangouts, its well-liked video chat tool, have been updated with six apps each in 2014, compared with 15 for YouTube and 16 for Chrome, both of which are also Google properties, and 19 for Facebook, 29 for Instagram and 33 for Twitter. Aside from his personal interest, Messina said he's disappointed because Facebook, with its more than 1.3 billion users, needs competition. ""The future of digital identity should not be determined by one company (namely, Facebook),"" he said. ""I still believe that competition in this space is better for consumers, for startups, and for the industry. And Google still remains one of the few companies (besides Apple, perhaps) that stands a chance to take on Facebook in this arena  --  but Google+, as I see it, has lost its way.""","Former Google+ employee says the social tool has failed .

"Ray Rice is a human who made a mistake that he'd never made before and that he won't make again, wife Janay Rice said in an interview that aired Monday. ""Ray knows me, and there's no way. He knows what he would have to deal with. ... I'm not going to sit there in silence and let something happen to me. And God forbid, in front of my child, just let it happen? There's no way."" It was Janay Rice's second interview since her husband, a former running back for the Baltimore Ravens, viciously knocked her out in a casino elevator in Atlantic City, New Jersey, after a night of heavy drinking. Images from inside the elevator would change the pair's lives, as Ray Rice was indefinitely suspended by the NFL, and Janay Rice became a poster child for domestic violence. The most shocking clip shows the 200-pound football player punching his then-fiancee, sending her head into the wall before she collapses unconscious to the floor. Surveillance video shows Ray Rice drag her partially out of the elevator and callously dump her limp body face-first on the ground. ""He said he was just terrified,"" Janay Rice told the ""Today"" show in an interview that aired Monday. ""He was in such shock that this just happened, he didn't know how to function."" Opening up . Sitting next to her mother, Candy Palmer, and occasionally fending off sniffles and dabbing her eyes with a tissue, Janay Rice said she was angry and hurt by her husband's violence, but it also hurt to see his career pulled out from under him, to lose the ""support system"" that the Ravens provided and to be forced to ""pick up and move."" She attributed Ray Rice's actions that February night, which ended with both of them initially charged with simple assault, on ""humanness."" ""Everybody makes mistakes. After this whole situation, you would think that we lived in a country full of people who never made a mistake,"" she said. In a news conference arranged by the team three months after the incident, Ray Rice apologized for the situation and to the Ravens and the team's fans. Janay Rice then issued a controversial apology herself, saying, ""I do deeply regret the role that I played in the incident."" The Ravens tweeted her words and then deleted them after a firestorm of criticism from those who questioned why Janay Rice would need to apologize after taking a left cross from a pro football player who benches 400 pounds. About that apology . Rice told ""Today"" she agreed to the press conference -- and to the Ravens' suggestion that she apologize -- because she thought it would help the situation. She dubbed the press conference ""awkward"" but defended her decision to apologize: ""I didn't think it was completely wrong for me to apologize because at the end of the day, I got arrested, too."" As for the perception that her husband was not conciliatory, Janay Rice refuted the notion, saying he apologized to her ""countless"" times. ""I wouldn't be sitting there next to him if I wasn't the first person to get an apology,"" she said. The Ravens initially defended their player and promised he'd be back. A prosecutor would later drop the charges against Janay Rice and upgrade Ray Rice's charges to aggravated assault. A grand jury indicted him in March. Ray and Janay Rice wed the next day. In July, after a disciplinary hearing, the NFL announced it would suspend Ray Rice for two games, a decision widely panned as wide receiver Josh Gordon was kept off the field significantly longer after failing a drug test for marijuana. Yet the league stuck by its decision until another surveillance video -- the one that captured the punch -- surfaced September 8. By the end of the day, the Ravens had released Rice and the NFL made his suspension indefinite. 'I was sick to watch it' Janay Rice never saw the second tape, saying she was ""not going to let the public bring me back there."" Her mother saw it, however, and said, ""I was sick to watch it."" Still, Janay Rice, who has been critical of the media's coverage of her and her husband, said the hardest part about remaining silent throughout the ordeal was seeing her life play out in the media. ""That's been the hardest part, is having so much of your life made public and have it all be negative. That's the hardest part, is not having control over anything that has to do with you. It's a natural thing for a human to want to come out and say, 'No, no. That's not me,' or 'No, that's not true.' But it's like a battle that we just can't win,"" she said. Monday's ""Today"" interview was the second time Janay Rice has addressed the ordeal, speaking first to ESPN, which granted her control over the final draft and release date of its story. During the interview, she discussed that night in Atlantic City, the aftermath, how she and Ray Rice met as teens and her disappointment in the Ravens for summarily dismissing him after years of loyalty. Could Ray Rice return? Last week, an arbitrator found that the NFL abused its discretion by indefinitely suspending Rice when it had originally sat him down for only two games. The decision cleared Rice to play again, and ESPN reports numerous teams are interested in the Rutgers University standout. Janay Rice concedes that if he is signed, it will be because a team was able to see past the jarring image of domestic violence that has come to define him. ""For them to look past this situation, which I know is going to be hard, but at the end of the day, he's a football player,"" she said. ""He's proven himself as a football player for seven years. There's never been a question of what he can do on the field."" While it remains to be seen, in this era of heightened concern over athletes and domestic violence, when Ray Rice might next take the field, it's abundantly clear that he will never lay another hand on Janay Rice, she and her mother said. ""There is no next time. We've made that clear. There is no next time,"" Palmer told ""Today."" The show will air the second part of its interview with Janay Rice on Tuesday, including a portion of the interview in which her husband participated.","Janay Rice says Baltimore Ravens suggested she apologize; she was OK with it .

"The nighttime curfew imposed in Thailand after last month's military coup has been lifted, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha said during his weekly address Friday. The announcement was read out and televised throughout Thailand. The Thai military instated the curfew when it seized power after months of unrest that had destabilized the elected government and caused outbursts of deadly violence in Bangkok. The curfew had already been lifted in more than 30 provinces and districts, including Thailand's tourist hotspots such as Phuket, Pattaya, Krabi and Koh Samui. But not Bangkok. The curfew posed a problem for Thailand's soccer fans who wanted to watch the World Cup games with friends -- many of the matches start between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. local time.","The Thai military instated the curfew when it seized power after months of unrest .

"Roger Federer has reached the U.S. Open semifinals for the first time since 2011, but he sure had to do it the hard way. Federer saved two match points and rallied from two sets down to defeat enigmatic Frenchman Gael Monfils 4-6 3-6 6-4 7-5 6-2 in a late-night thriller in New York. The two played in Cincinnati just a few weeks ago and Monfils stretched Federer to a deciding third set. He was even closer to upsetting the 17-time grand slam champion under the lights at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Thursday, holding two match points on Federer's serve at 5-4 in the fourth. While Federer saved the second match point with a winning forehand, Monfils had an opportunity on the first match point, only to miss a backhand long. Monfils never recovered. He double faulted twice to drop serve in the next game, Federer held to claim the set and the 33-year-old then cruised in a quick fifth set. It was the ninth time in his career Federer came back from two sets down. The last time it happened was at Wimbledon in 2012 -- against another Frenchman, Julien Benneteau. In a potentially good omen for Federer, he went on to win the title at the All England Club -- his last success at a major. ""I got off to a good start, so I was actually feeling alright, but then when I was down two match points, that's when I wasn't feeling so great anymore,"" Federer, 28-1 in night session matches at the U.S. Open, said on court afterwards. ""I thought, 'This is it. This is the last point, man, just go down fighting, don't miss an easy shot and let him have it.' ""But I served well and stayed in the match and somehow turned it around. I felt great in the fifth, though. ""I was really starting to play better and better as the match went on, and that's a great feeling."" Federer faces the resurgent Marin Cilic in Saturday's semifinals after the big-serving Croat dispatched Czech sixth seed Tomas Berdych in straight sets. A year ago Cilic sat out the U.S. Open due to a doping suspension. The other semifinal sees top seed Novak Djokovic meet Japan's Kei Nishikori, a maiden grand slam semifinalist. They won their quarterfinals Wednesday. For Monfils and France, it marks more disappointment. The country's wait for a men's grand slam singles champion will extend to 32 years. ""I will need time to forget about this match, but it gives me more motivation,"" the 24th-ranked Monfils was quoted as saying by L'Equipe. ""He (saved) those two (match points), so bravo to him. After that it was hard because my serve wasn't good. He played well and me, I had a (dip) for five minutes. ""I felt tired physically and mentally, too, and he was very aggressive at that time."" Serena Williams and pal Caroline Wozniacki will meet in the women's final if they both -- as expected -- progress Friday. Williams, the only grand slam singles champion of the women's semifinalists, plays Russian left-hander Ekaterina Makarova and former No. 1 Wozniacki plays China's Peng Shuai. Makarova, though, owns a grand slam win over Williams at the Australian Open in 2012.","Roger Federer rallies from two sets down to beat Gael Monfils in New York .

"Provincetown is an oasis with the kind of light that inspires artists and writers, a town at the tip of Massachusetts' Cape Cod that celebrates the LGBT community. It's a small town of nearly 3,000 year-rounders that grows to 60,000 to 100,000 residents in summer, when many visitors come to celebrate Carnival, Family Week, Bear Week and more. They also come to see the Broadway theater types and drag queens who hawk their shows along Ptown's main drag, Commercial Street. Day tourists jump on the fast ferry from Boston to buy T-shirts and gawk, while nature lovers leave town to explore the many different sides of Cape Cod National Seashore. Around the world in 18 photos . Isn't that enough for a town of just three square miles? But there's more. It's also where Anthony Bourdain started as a dishwasher at the Flagship Bar & Grill, called the Dreadnaught in his classic chef's memoir, ""Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly."" As Bourdain returns to Massachusetts in this week's episode of ""Parts Unknown,"" we explore other reasons to love Ptown. The country's oldest continuous art colony . Look at the landscape and you'll know why Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning painted here. But it's not just the beauty of the place; it's also the community that helps artists create and show their work. Founded by local artists and townspeople a century ago, the Provincetown Art Association and Museum (PAAM) supports the town's incredible art scene through exhibitions, conversations and its Museum School. The colony is nestled in the town's East End, known for its large concentration of galleries (although other galleries are located throughout town). Start at the PAAM building and wander down Commercial Street for more inspiration. 10 things you didn't know about Vegas . A who's who of writers shacked up here . Some of the world's best writers, playwrights and poets have come to the Outer Cape. Writers Norman Mailer and Jack Kerouac, poet e.e. cummings and playwright Eugene O'Neill were drawn to the beach shacks near Provincetown to write. You can write there, too: The National Park Service, which oversees the shacks now, and local non-profits help pick artists and writers for residencies at the shacks. Director John Waters can sometimes be spotted in town, as can Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Cunningham. Our understated favorite, often called the poet of Provincetown's off-season, is noted Pulitzer Prize- and National Book Award-winning poet Mary Oliver. She's lived here for more than 40 years. Oliver's work quietly whispers of the beauty of the place: ""At Blackwater Pond the tossed waters have settled/after a night of rain./I dip my cupped hands./I drink/a long time. It tastes/like stone, leaves, fire. It falls cold/into my body, waking the bones. I hear them/deep inside me, whispering/oh what is that beautiful thing/that just happened?"" Tennessee Williams made his mark here . American playwright Tennessee Williams spent just four summers in Provincetown in the 1940s, but the work he wrote here-- ""The Glass Menagerie"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" -- is seminal. That's why the Provincetown Tennessee Williams Theater Festival was launched in 2006. The festival presents the works of Tennessee Williams in September, two weeks before Columbus Day. Ten works have had their world premieres here. Harvest your own cranberries . Cape Cod National Seashore stretches beyond the tiny enclave of Provincetown, protecting some 44,600 acres of seashores, marine life, dunes and more. While swimming, exploring the dunes and tide pools and hiking is popular during the summer season, there's also much to explore off-season. Locals know you can gather certain fruits and berries, including cranberries and blueberries, at harvest time. There's a daily fruit limit of one gallon per person, while the limit on edible mushrooms is five gallons per person per day. At most national park sites, visitors are not allowed to collect the park's resources for personal use. However, limited foraging of certain foods is allowed within the national seashore, because it's a traditional use on Cape Cod. National Park Service foraging rules on Cape Cod (PDF) The Pilgrims came here first . The Pilgrim Monument that towers over Provincetown honors the first landfall of the Mayflower Pilgrims in the so-called ""new world"" on November 21, 1620.  The five-week stay was important: While anchored in Provincetown harbor, the Pilgrims wrote and signed the Mayflower Compact establishing the founding principle of self-rule for the group. Apparently Provincetown was not to their liking as much as it is to ours: The Pilgrims left for Plymouth after a few weeks to establish a settlement there. The monument was built between 1907 and 1910. Modern visitors who can climb to the top of the 252-foot-tall monument, get a sticker and bragging rights for the day. The Portuguese came next . While the Portuguese fishing community that once thrived in Provincetown since the 1840s is mostly gone, a few fishing vessels and the culture's influence remain. A fine bowl of Portuguese soup can still be found at the Mayflower and Lobster Pot restaurants. And it's worth standing in line at the Portuguese Bakery for the sweet, fried dough called mulosayos. (Buy them hot.) Want more? People come to celebrate the town's Portuguese heritage during the town's annual festival. Spot the floating houses . Scattered throughout Provincetown are homes dating back to the early 19th century. They are called Long Point Floaters, adorned with blue and white plaques of a house floating on water. These homes were originally built in the nearby community of Long Point. When shore fishing became more difficult around 1850, more than 30 homes were floated across the harbor to Provincetown. The plaques mark the homes that still exist today. From whale hunting to whale watching . The whaling industry dominated Provincetown life during the 19th century. Although the discovery of oil in Pennsylvania would eventually reduce the demand for whale oil, the last whaler didn't stop sailing until the 1920s. Some 50 years later, the town became known for whale watching and preservation. Dolphin Fleet has been operating whale watch tours since the 1970s, and summer tourists crowd the ships during the summer. The trips feature naturalists trained by the town's Center for Coastal Studies, which works to preserve marine life off the coast of Cape Cod. The center offers programs year-round to educate adults and children alike on the wonders of humpback and right whales, seals and the area's magical tide pools.","The town where the Pilgrims first landed is also home to a century-old art colony .

"(CNN) -- The 2014 Soul Train Music Awards had something for just about everyone. The show aired Sunday and had not only reunions but some meme-worthy moments. Talk show host Wendy Williams served as the mistress of ceremonies for the event, which included a medley from singer Chris Brown. But the word for the night was ""throwback"" as acts from the past took to the stage at the Orleans Arena in Las Vegas. One of the main draws was the reunion of 1990s R&B group Jodeci. Original members brothers K-Ci and Jojo Hailey and brothers Devante and Dalvin DeGrate performed some of their hits and debuted a new song, ""Nobody Wins,"" with B.o.B. But the Internet quickly fell in love with Devante's hairstyle: a little side ponytail, reminding some of the photo on a popular African-American hair care product, Just for Me.

"A third teen is in custody in the death of a man beaten with a hammer on a St. Louis street, and police are looking for a fourth suspect. Two juveniles -- 15 and 16 -- were arrested Sunday in the attack, which apparently started with a verbal exchange.  An investigation is under way. The third juvenile, a 17-year-old male, turned himself in to police, the St. Louis Police Department said. He was charged with first degree murder and armed criminal action. Prosecutors identified him as Robert Mitchell, and he is being charged as an adult. The victim, 32-year-old Zemir Begic, suffered injuries to his head, abdomen, face and mouth, according to police. He was unconscious by the time officers arrived. Begic was taken to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said. ""Investigation revealed the victim was traveling in his vehicle when several juveniles approached his vehicle on foot and began damaging it. ""The victim exited his vehicle and the juveniles began yelling at the victim and striking him with hammers. After the assault, the juveniles fled the scene on foot,"" read an incident report. According to the probable cause statement, Begic was with his fiancee and two others when he was attacked. Mitchell taunted Begic, challenged him to a fight, and then the four teens began to beat him, the statement says. At least one of the assailants struck the victim with a hammer. On Monday, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said police are searching for a fourth teen. The unusual hammer attack raised questions about motive, but there is no indication that this was a targeted crime, Dotson said. Police have determined that there was a dispute between Begic and his attackers. Begic got in his car and one of the youths kicked his car, Dotson said. At that point, Begic exited the car and the violent assault happened, he said.","Investigation ongoing into attack on St. Louis street that killed man; motive unknown .

"It's the picture we needed to see after the past week's turmoil. A 12-year-old black boy, tears streaming down his face, and a white police officer embrace in the middle of a Ferguson-related demonstration in Portland, Oregon. The story behind the image is just as touching. The boy, Devonte Hart, was holding a sign offering ""Free Hugs"" during a Tuesday protest over a grand jury's decision not to indict Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson. Portland police Sgt. Bret Barnum approached Devonte and extended his hand. Barnum said he approached Devonte ""not as a police officer but just a human being"" when he saw him crying. Devonte seemed hesitant to talk at first, but Barnum said he broke the ice by talking about life, travel and summer vacations before asking for a hug. ""The situation itself is something police officers do every day when they go out on the street and make citizen contacts,"" Barnum said. The Oregonian newspaper was the first media outlet to publish the photo by 20-year-old freelance photographer Johnny Nguyen. Within hours of its posting on Facebook, the photo had been shared more than 150,000 times, leading the Oregonian to call it ""the hug shared around the world."" ""I really believe in my heart that this is what most people want -- to find the common good in all people and find things we can agree on, not fight about,"" one Facebook commenter said. ""I love this picture and wish that little boy the best life has to offer."" Barnum said he was surprised by the overwhelming response but ""really happy"" to be part of something that imparted a sense of peace in troubled times. ""It solidified what all of us do this work for -- this job for -- to create good will,"" he said. Nguyen said he attended the rally to take pictures for himself. ""When I came across Devonte, who was holding a 'Free Hugs' sign and tears running down his face, I knew right there and then there was something special about him,"" he said. ""My gut told me to stay at the scene despite other photo opportunities in the crowd."" Nguyen captured a few snaps of Devonte and then turned around to get some shots of other people. When he turned back, he saw Devonte speaking to Barnum. ""I thought, what a great scene. A powerful scene. A scene with a message that needed to be communicated. A scene of coming together,"" he said. ""They hugged it out, and I got as close as I could and snapped away."" The photo ""spread like wildfire"" in a day. Nguyen said he has received hundreds of emails and messages saying how the photograph made people feel more hopeful, that it restored faith in humanity or brought them to tears. Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . ""I knew it had something special, something powerful. It had a message I think everyone wanted to see,"" he said. ""I think it goes to show everybody was clamoring for hope in the midst of the violence and conflict going on today. I'm glad my photo has done that. Yes, I'm a photographer, but in the end, I'm a human being who wants better for other human beings, and I'm glad I can play my part by sharing the incredible photo. I wish to see everyone continue to be positive and spread love, always."" CNN's Facebook audience appeared to agree. As one commenter said, ""This is a powerful message. I applaud you, young man. Sending you a cyber hug."" What did you think of this picture? Share your thoughts on CNN's Facebook page.","Sgt. Bret Barnum says he approached boy ""not as a police officer"" but as a human .

"The death of a 7-year-old Virginia girl from a suspected peanut allergy at school has raised questions about how prepared school officials are to handle sudden reactions in children. First-grader Ammaria Johnson died Monday after breaking out in hives and complaining of shortness of breath at recess. School authorities called paramedics after she was taken to the nurse's office, said Lt. Jason Elmore, a spokesman for the Chesterfield County Fire Department in suburban Richmond. ""From what we understand, she possibly had gotten something outside,"" Elmore said. The clinic had no medication to give her and called 911, he said. ""It's very straightforward. There is no magic to this,"" said Maria Acebal, the head of the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network. ""It's just proper education, how to recognize it, and how to treat it."" Acebal said 8% of American kids -- including one of hers -- have food allergies. ""When consequences can be life-threatening, then you've got to have schools prepared for an allergic reaction,"" she said. Shawn Smith, a spokesman for the Chesterfield County school district, said administrators have extensive guidelines for treating students with severe allergies, and details of those guidelines were sent to parents last year. Parents have to provide any prescribed medication to the schools, along with a one-page form authorizing them to administer it in case of an emergency, he said. ""When any or all of the resources are not provided, the public health nurse makes contact with the family in an effort to obtain the necessary medication,"" Smith said in a written statement to CNN. One common treatment is the use of an epinephrine injector, a penlike device that administers the drug for a severe reaction. Those have to be prescribed by a doctor, and the school had no such device for Ammaria, Elmore said. The girl's death remains under investigation, Chesterfield County police spokeswoman Elizabeth Caroon told CNN. Caroon said the body has been turned over to state medical examiners for an autopsy, but it was not clear whether that procedure had been performed Wednesday. ""It's absolutely doable to keep kids with food allergies safe at public school, but it requires education and preparedness,"" Acebal  said. Ammarie's death ""just underscores the need for all teachers to have the basics of food allergy safety as part of their orientation and continuing education.""","First-grader Ammaria Johnson died of a suspected peanut allergy .

"Kimberly and Craig Fugate were expecting Kenleigh, Kristen and Kayleigh. But Kelsey, born with her sisters on February 8, was a complete surprise. The identical quadruplets were born via cesarean section in the Winfred L. Wiser Hospital for Women and Infants at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi. ""They had gotten the three out and they said, 'More feet,'"" the mother told CNN affiliate WAPT. ""I said, 'No!' It was an instant shock."" The odds of spontaneous quadruplets -- conceived without fertility assistance -- are 1 in 729,000, according to Dr. James Bofill, Kimberly Fugate's physician and a professor of maternal fetal medicine at the University of Mississippi. The odds in this case were even slimmer as the Fugate girls are identical, meaning they split from a single egg. ""Those odds are incalculable,"" Bofill said in a hospital press release. The last known set of identical quadruplets was born in Germany in January 2012. Experts estimate there are 50 to 60 sets worldwide. You may know the Mathias quads -- Grace, Emily, Mary Claire and Anna -- who are in the eighth grade and appeared on the Discovery Health Channel's ""Super Quads."" And perhaps you remember a Lifetime reality show called ""Four of a Kind,"" which featured identical quadruplets Megan, Kendra, Sarah and Calli Durst, of Buffalo, Minnesota. The Fugates were originally surprised to learn they were pregnant at all, according to WAPT. Then in November, the 42-year-old mom was told she was having triplets. The fourth baby managed to keep her existence a secret until Fugate went into labor at 28 weeks. Kenleigh Rosa was born at 7:55, weighing 2 pounds, 1 ounce. Kristen Sue was born at 7:57 weighing 2 pounds, 4 ounces. Kayleigh Pearl was born at 7:58 weighing 2 pounds, 8 ounces. And Kelsey Roxanne was born a minute later weighing 2 pounds, 6 ounces. Bofill told The Clarion Ledger the hidden quad was a first in his 27-year career. ""I was very embarrassed, obviously,"" Bofill said. ""The news was sent to me by one of my fellows. I thought she was kidding."" The quadruplets join older sister Katelyn, who is 10 years old. It's unclear when they'll be able to go home. ""Typically, when babies are born prematurely, doctors tell the families to expect them to stay in the (neonatal intensive care unit) until their original due date, which in this case would be May 2,"" said hospital spokeswoman Jennifer Hospodor. ""It is possible that some or all of the girls would be stronger enough to go home before that, or have to stay longer. It depends on how they develop over the next 12 weeks.""","Identical quadruplets were born to a Mississippi mom on February 8 .

"(CNN) -- More than 60,000 people have now been infected with cholera in Zimbabwe, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Tendani Baloyi, 4, gets treated for cholera in Musina, on the border between Zimbabwe and South Africa. Latest figures released Friday from the organization also show that 3,161 people have died from the disease since August 2008. In December, WHO spokesman Paul Garwood told CNN the organization an estimated 60,000 people would be infected with cholera in the ""worst case scenario."" But that number now stands at 60,401 and shows no sign of abating the agency said. The WHO, a Geneva, Switzerland-based organization, said ""drastic action,"" was now needed to curb one of the world's largest outbreaks of cholera. The UN agency called for ""political differences to be put aside"" and for international intervention to deal with the crisis. ""We are dealing with an extraordinary public health crisis that requires from us all an extraordinary public health emergency response, and this must happen now before the outbreak causes more needless suffering and death,"" the WHO's Dr Eric Laroche said on its Web site. ""Political differences need to be put aside, economic barriers overcome, health services in the country's periphery strengthened and community awareness to respond enhanced to save many more people from dying due to a disease that can be readily prevented and treated, "" he added. Since August, the cholera epidemic has swept through a country wracked with a political and economic crises. It has also coincided with a nearly five-month-long strike by doctors and nurses who are demanding salaries in foreign currency. Cholera is an intestinal disease caused by bacteria in contaminated water. The epidemic has been aggravated by erratic water supplies, shortages of water purification chemicals, broken water and sewer pipes and uncollected garbage from a waste-disposal system that has collapsed. Children can be seen playing on heaps of uncollected garbage in the suburbs of most urban areas in Zimbabwe. In early December, President Robert Mugabe's government declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency, paving the way for aid from international groups such as Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders, W.H.O., the U.N. Children's Fund and USAID. But that assistance has not yet improved the situation, and the disease has spread to new areas since then. ""The problem in Zimbabwe is that the infrastructure is obsolete, especially when it comes to water sanitation. People are going for months without tap water in towns,"" said Peter Hinn, the director of a German group called Welt Hunger Hilfe (World Hunger Help), which is helping to fight cholera in Zimbabwe. ""In rural areas, 60 to 70 percent of boreholes (wells) are not working. So the international community might have come in but they have to address this infrastructure."" Zimbabwe was already suffering an enormous economic crisis, with a hyperinflationary economy and shortages of all essentials including food, fuel, cash, foreign currency and electricity. The country's rainy season peaks in January or February and ends in late March, and Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned the epidemic could get worse during that time as runoff from the rains spreads the bacteria to other rivers, streams and wells. Mugabe declared in mid-December that the cholera epidemic had slowed, but health experts differed with him and the latest figures seem to contradict his statement.","World Health Organization reveals number of cholera cases is more than 60,000 .
Health experts believe the disease is not under control or slowing .
No sanitation or clean water, piles of garbage help spread disease .
President announced disease down, but numbers belie that statement ."
"Video of two sisters in India fighting back against men who allegedly harassed them has gone viral. The footage shows Aarti and Pooja Kumar landing punches and thrashing the three men with a belt while riding a bus in the northern state of Haryana, an area with a reputation for hostility to women. Violence against women and rape in India have made international headlines in the past few years, and the scene of two women fighting back has sparked widespread praise on social media. Aarti Kumar, 22, told CNN that she and Pooja, 19, were standing at a bus stop near their college Friday when the men came up to them and began taunting and throwing pieces of paper with their telephone numbers. The sisters tried to ignore the men but they persisted. Then they followed the sisters onto the bus, she said. You're too poor to even ride the bus, Kumar recalled the men saying. So she and her sister did what they thought they had to do to defend and protect themselves. One lurched toward one of the men, thrashing what looks like a belt. Both grabbed one man's sweater and pulled. Two of the men grabbed the women, and they struggled to get free. One sister pressed the palm of her hand against a man trying to overcome her. Aarti Kumar said that no one on the bus tried to help the sisters, and some passengers shouted for them to stop fighting the men and get off. The men have been arrested, and charges are pending further investigation, police told CNN. The video, shot by a passenger, has been shared in many news stories in India and inspired the Twitter hashtag ""IFoughtThemBack."" Some women are tweeting that they too have fought men who harassed them and are glad that the video is garnering so much attention. In a highly unusual turn, the government is rewarding the Kumar sisters for their actions. Harayana's Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced that the sisters would be recognized with ""bravery"" awards that include cash on January 26, India's Republic Day. Kumar said her parents have been very supportive of her and her sister, also unusual because girls and women in some areas of India are often discouraged from reporting instances of harassment. Stories of rape and sexual harassment in India have received much attention recently. In June, three brothers confessed to raping two teenage girls in Uttar Pradesh state. Police said at first that the suspects hanged their victims from a mango tree, but an investigation of their deaths concluded last week that the girls committed suicide. A gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi in late 2012 brought into stark relief the danger that some women face in India. The crime ignited campaigns to call attention to violent crime that targets women.","Aarti and Pooja Kumar say they were being taunted at a bus stop by three men .

"Halloween can be extra scary for kids with food allergies. Chocolate is frightening if you're allergic to milk, and a candy bar with nuts can be deadly. With eggs, soy and wheat also common allergies in kids, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, finding treats without tricks can be a challenge on Halloween night. That's why the Food Allergy Research & Education organization wants Halloween lovers to go teal this holiday. Their Teal Pumpkin Project encourages people to place a teal-painted pumpkin outside their door if they're offering non-foods treats, such as small toys, stickers and crayons. A flyer can also be printed from the website. The idea is taking off online. Food Allergy Research & Education's first Facebook post about the Teal Pumpkin Project, reached 2.7 million people in less than 72 hours, the organization reported. Posts about the project have been shared a combined 31,000 times. This year marks the first time the idea has been promoted nationally. ""The Teal Pumpkin Project is an easy way to make a big impact in your community. Food allergies can be life-threatening, and they affect 1 in 13 children in the United States. We are thrilled to see so many people embracing the Teal Pumpkin Project as a way to ensure kids with food allergies can enjoy a safe, fun Halloween experience just like their friends,"" says Veronica LaFemina, spokeswoman for Food Allergy Research & Education. LaFemina says they are already starting to see photos of children with paintbrushes and teal pumpkins on doorsteps via Instagram and other social media channels. Families who are managing other diseases for which candy presents a problem, such as diabetes and celiac disease, have also shown support. If you don't want to purchase non-food items, it is helpful to separate allergy-free candy from candy that may trigger an allergic reaction if you're handing out goodies on October 31. Cross-contamination is a concern, as many food allergies require only a small amount of the allergen to trigger a reaction. No tricks this Halloween, just allergy-friendly treats . Tips for parents . Parents should also use extra caution when checking Halloween candy if their child has an allergy. ""Checking labels becomes very pivotal because during the holidays, including Halloween, when the manufacturers make those mini small-sized candies and they're often mass-produced on shared equipment,"" says Mireille Schwartz, the founder and CEO of the Bay Area Allergy Advisory Board. ""Candy that's safe other times of the year might not be safe during Halloween."" Carrying an epinephrine auto-injector, which treats all anaphylaxis, is also a good safety measure. Schwartz recommends checking to see if the medication is up-to-date before leaving the house, as auto-injectors typically expire within one year. And while enjoying treats while walking door-to-door is a highlight of Halloween, it's best if parents make sure their child avoids the sweets until they can be inspected at home. For younger children, Schwartz adds, ""You don't want to bring up the larger, darker side of things. You just want to say you're going to check the candy to make sure it's safe.""","Some Halloween candy can trigger food allergies .

"What motivated an American soldier to allegedly open fire and kill 16 innocent Afghan civilians in cold blood? No one knows at this point. The soldier, an Army staff sergeant, seems to have acted alone, and he turned himself in to authorities after the shooting rampage. What we do know is that he had been injured in an accident while deployed to Iraq in 2010. Despite being diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, he was found fit for duty. It's common for the military to evaluate service members for fitness for duty. The most important question asked is: Can the soldier safely and effectively perform his job from a mental health or neuropsychological standpoint? More than a million individuals suffer a traumatic brain injury each year in the United States. Many of these people have experienced problems processing complex information. However, the execution-style killing of innocent people is not something that people with a traumatic brain injury would carry out. So while it's possible that ""brain damage"" is a contributing factor, it is unlikely to explain the slayings. One convenient answer would be that he is a ""bad apple,"" he simply went temporarily insane. If that were the case, then no military leader or peer could have predicted the rampage. He is a rogue soldier who can plead insanity in the court of justice. The blame falls solely on him. However, one can't help but wonder whether the recent spate of events, including the desecration of Taliban corpses by four Marines, the burning of the Quran by U.S. troops, and now, the slaying of Afghan civilians, point to the toll that the Afghanistan war is taking. Has the psychological impact of the long war been underestimated? Afghanistan, by any standard, is a tough terrain with complex politics and even more complex culture. The mental, emotional and physical burden on our troops is formidable. Most of Afghanistan's population is uneducated and illiterate, and held in terror by the Taliban, who operate through threats, corruption, extortion, blackmail and intimidation. Our troops must not only deal with the daily risks of attacks from the Taliban, but also mistrust, unease or hostility from the Afghans. While U.S. forces attempt to interact as much as possible with locals, the fact remains that they are foreigners who are mostly stationed on temporary bases, located far away from community centers and operate mostly on mission-based initiatives. War, of course, is always stressful. History has many examples. And the war in Afghanistan is no exception. During the American Civil War, the stress associated with going to war was known as homesickness. During WWI, it was shell shock. After WWII, it was battle fatigue. During the Gulf War, a new term was coined -- Combat Stress Reaction. Combat stress is now thought to be a normal reaction to the abnormal events encountered during war, including different rules of engagement, morale ups and downs, fatigue, sensory overload or extreme weather. Anger toward the civilian community is also considered a symptom. The U.S. military is not naïve to combat stress. Much effort has been made to prepare troops for the symptoms of combat stress before deployment. Once troops are deployed, they can be provided immediate assistance if problems arise and help is nearby. Our military has been a technological leader in building better armored vehicles, using superior aerial surveillance via remotely operated drones and employing ever better laser-guided missiles. But the Pentagon should also emphasize an important nontechnological component in its military training: the need to include a better understanding of the crosscultural challenges that are likely to be encountered when troops are deployed into foreign combat zones like Afghanistan. As we learn more about the 38-year-old married staff sergeant who is a qualified infantry sniper and serving his third deployment in the Middle East, we have already learned one very painful lesson. Namely, there is an expensive psychological cost to sending our men and women to war.","An American soldier allegedly went on a rampage and killed 16 Afghan civilians .

"Deadly street fighting, helicopters shot down and civilians being used as human shields. That was the picture that emerged Friday in southern Ukraine as violence escalated amid reports that dozens of people were killed in a fire and still more were shot dead or wounded in street fighting, raising the question of whether the country can stave off a possible civil war. The violence -- pitting pro-Russian separatists against Ukrainian forces and those who support the government in Kiev -- prompted an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, with Russia demanding an end to what it called Ukrainian aggression and Western powers accusing Moscow of funding the violence. Russia and the West have squared off diplomatically over the fate of Ukraine, after Moscow annexed Crimea in March following the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. He was pushed from office after months of protests by people upset that he had turned away from Europe in favor of Russia. The crisis in eastern Ukraine hit a boiling point with news Friday that security forces launched their most intensive effort yet to try to dislodge pro-Russian separatists, who have reportedly seized a number of government buildings in nearly a dozen cities and towns. Helicopters downed . Two Ukrainian government helicopters were shot down in the flashpoint city of Slavyansk. The helicopters were brought down by fire from pro-Russian separatists, the Ukraine Ministry of Defense said. Five pro-Russian separatists and two civilians were killed in Slavyansk in a Ukrainian military operation, the city's self-declared mayor, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov. Two Ukrainian soldiers were killed during an attack in the village of Andriyivka, near Slavyansk, defense ministry said. The gunmen also blocked a bridge in the area, using local residents, including women, as shields, according to the ministry. Hundreds of miles away, in the Black Sea city of Odessa, at least four people were killed and 40 were wounded in fighting, according to the regional police administration. Another 31 people died after a fire was started at a trade union building amid clashes in the largely Russian-speaking Odessa, police said. Authorities initially reported 38 people had died, but later revised it. Video posted on YouTube appeared to show Molotov cocktails being thrown by Kiev supporters at the building where pro-Russian separatists had reportedly taken up positions. The footage, which CNN could not independently confirm, showed people sitting on ledges trying to escape the fire and thick smoke. CNN cannot independently confirm the casualty counts. The United States condemned the violence that led to the fire. ""The violence and mayhem that led to so many senseless deaths and injuries is unacceptable,"" Marie Harf, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman, said. The events that led to the fire ""underscore the need for an immediate de-escalation of tensions in Ukraine,"" Harf said. The violence came the same day that U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged to seek harsher sanctions against Russia if Ukraine doesn't stabilize in time for elections this month. The two leaders warned Russia could face a new round of sanctions by the West, if it does not stop its actions in Ukraine. ""There just has not been the kind of honesty and credibility about the situation there and the willingness to engage seriously"" in finding a diplomatic solution, Obama said. But the threat seemed to do little to waive off Russia, with its Foreign Ministry saying Ukraine's use of its military in Slavyansk is criminal. 'Nail in the coffin' Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told CNN the military operation was ""the last nail in the coffin"" for the deal agreed to last month in Geneva, Switzerland, which called for illegal militia groups in eastern Ukraine to disarm and vacate seized buildings. Putin has been kept fully informed of unfolding events and regards the situation with ""grave concern,"" Peskov said. What's not yet clear is whether the escalating violence may prompt a response by Russia, which has previously said it has the right to intervene in Ukraine to protect Russian speakers. Besides the threat from pro-Russian separatists, NATO estimates that Russia has some 40,000 troops massed near Ukraine's border. Negotiations complicated . Peskov said the Ukrainian operation also complicated ongoing negotiations to free seven Western observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, who have been held captive by separatists in Slavyansk for the past week. Russia's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, raised concern about the safety of a special presidential envoy, Vladimir Lukin, sent to southeastern Ukraine to negotiate a possible release of the OSCE observers. Its statement cited ""reports about English-speaking foreigners spotted among attackers,"" saying there should be no ""external interference"" in Ukraine's affairs. As the diplomatic wrangling continued, residents of Slavyansk were warned Friday to stay home and avoid windows as the latest phase of the authorities' ""anti-terrorist operation"" got under way. The two Mi24 helicopters were downed with mobile air defense systems, killing two military officers and injuring others, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry website. Another army helicopter, an Mi8, was damaged, but no one was hurt, it said. Pro-Russian separatists took one badly injured pilot hostage after his helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing, the ministry said, and efforts to free him are ongoing. Ukraine's security service, the SBU, said one helicopter that came under attack was carrying medics, one of whom was injured. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti earlier reported that one Russian separatist was killed and another wounded in Slavyansk. The operation also targeted the town of Kramatorsk. Meanwhile, Russian airline Aeroflot said it was canceling flights Friday to the eastern cities of Kharkiv and Donetsk because it didn't have permission to enter Ukrainian airspace. Human shield allegation . In his Facebook post, Arsen Avakov, the Ukrainian interior minister, said nine checkpoints that were under control of pro-Russian separatists in Slavyansk have been taken back by Ukrainian forces, who now encircle the town. What the Ukrainian authorities want from the separatists has not changed, he said -- release the hostages, turn in weapons, vacate seized administrative buildings and allow the normal functioning of the city. Ukraine's security service also accused separatist leaders of ordering separatists to use residents as human shields in the city and at checkpoints. Acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov acknowledged this week that the central government has effectively lost control of the country's Donetsk and Luhansk regions to the pro-Russian separatists. He signed a decree introducing military conscription Thursday in a bid to beef up Ukraine's military, citing ""real and potential threats to Ukraine."" Why NATO is such a thorn in Russia's side .

"(CNN) -- The Yemen-based arm of the al Qaeda terrorist network claimed responsibility Friday for last week's plot to send explosive devices on cargo planes bound for the United States. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which had been suspected in the plot, posted its claim on various radical Islamist websites, saying, ""We will continue to strike blows against American interests and the interest of America's allies."" The statement also claimed the group is responsible for the crash of a UPS cargo plane in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on September 3. Investigators said earlier this month they had failed to turn up any evidence that terrorism was involved in that crash, which killed the two pilots aboard, according to a U.S. government official. About 45 minutes after UPS Flight 6 departed Dubai International Airport for Cologne, Germany, the crew declared an emergency due to smoke in the cockpit. They asked to return to Dubai, but shortly before the plane could get to the airport it crashed. Officials in the United Arab Emirates have said -- and a U.S. official confirmed -- that the plane's cockpit voice recorder has been examined and nothing on it indicates an explosion. Explosions have distinctive sound signatures, and that would have been recorded on the device, the official said. The UAE said it has ""eliminated the possibility of an onboard explosion, following a detailed onsite investigation of the wreckage."" A U.S. counterterrorism official said Friday that while ""there are very strong indications that AQAP was responsible for plotting last week's disrupted cargo plane plot ... we can't confirm at this point their claims about the early September incident."" White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan said Sunday that the United States is ""looking very carefully"" at the September crash to see if it could be related to the recent terror threat involving cargo aircraft. The latest threat was revealed October 29 when authorities in the United Arab Emirates and Britain found two explosives-laden packages sent from Yemen that were addressed to synagogues in Chicago, Illinois. The statement by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said that since Western media did not link the September UPS plane crash to the group, ""we decided not to announce it so we could carry on a similar operation."" ""We did that this time using two devices, one of which was sent via the American UPS company and the other via the American FedEx company,"" the statement said. The devices, loaded with the powerful explosive PETN, were packed in computer printer toner cartridges and designed to be detonated by a cell phone, a source close to the investigation has said. Friday's claim of responsibility by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula warned that ""since both operations were successful, we intend to spread the idea to our mujahedeen brothers in the world and enlarge the circle of its application to include civilian aircraft in the West as well as cargo aircraft."" U.S. investigators believe that al Qaeda bombmaker Ibrahim Hasan al-Asiri, 28, is linked to the packages, according to a federal official who was briefed by authorities. Al-Asiri, who is thought to be in Yemen, is a Saudi who ranked high on Saudi Arabia's list of most wanted published in February 2009. He is also believed to be the bomber who designed last year's failed attempt to blow up a U.S. airliner as it landed in Detroit, Michigan, on December 25. A U.S. official said that the devices found in the packages last week were very sophisticated and could have exploded in flight, but it wasn't clear whether that was the intent. The group's statement said the devices' designs ""allow us the opportunity to detonate them in the air or after their arrival to their ultimate destination, and they are designed to pass through all detectors."" The packages were discovered thanks to a tip from Saudi Arabia. Saudi officials provided tracking numbers of the two packages bound for Jewish organizations in the United States, enabling quick tracing to the United Kingdom and Dubai, a source told CNN. Friday's statement denounced the Saudi assistance in thwarting the plot, saying, ""God has exposed you and showed the world that you are nothing but treacherous agents to the Jews because these bomb packages were headed to Jewish-Zionist temples, and you had to intervene with your treacherous ways to protect them, so may God curse you for being the oppressors."" But two U.S. officials said that the street addresses found on the packages were not the current locations of the synagogues and that the packages were addressed to historical figures from the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition. After last week's incidents, U.S. government authorities grounded packages originating from Yemen destined for the United States. Yemen has asked for outside help to thwart terror groups, but the country, the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, is still used for operations, U.S. officials say. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula says it will spread the package-bomb idea to others .

"(CNN)During Tuesday's taping of Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show,"" Jon Stewart's studio audience learned the news that would shortly become public: The comedian, who never shied away from stinging commentary on the state of politics and the news media, was leaving the host chair after 17 years, saying, ""in my heart I know it is time for someone else to have that opportunity."" ""I'm gonna have dinner, on a school night, with my family -- who, I have heard from multiple sources, are lovely people,"" he joked of his plans. At the end, the show cut to a clip of a monkey washing a cat, mixing the lighthearted with a serious moment in true ""Daily Show"" form. Stewart's top 5 political moments . Stewart fans took this tone to heart and started the #JobsForJonStewart hashtag on Twitter, offering career advice from the sensible to the silly. On the heels of Brian Williams' six-month suspension without pay from NBC Nightly News, many championed Stewart to replace Williams. Last year, CNN's Christiane Amanpour asked Stewart a similar question: Would he ever host a show like ""Meet the Press,"" as was, at the time, being speculated? ""Like yourself? Like a real journalist?"" he asked. How Stewart changed politics . He continued, ""That, I don't believe, is in danger of happening. Yeah. That I can pretty confidently state that I will not have my own 'Room of Situations.' That's just a name I came up with, a 'Room of Situations.' "" Other Twitter users also suggested Stewart step into a more serious role, including as the president of the United States. And, because Twitter trends topically, the hashtag came rife with Left Shark and other of-the-moment references.","Fans offered suggestions for Jon Stewart's next career on social media .

"In the wake of a botched execution, an Oklahoma court has granted a six-month stay for a man on death row. Earlier, the state's attorney general had said his office would not object to the stay for Charles Warner. An investigation into the death of Clayton Lockett last month continues. His lethal injection was stopped because of problems in administering the drugs. Officials say he later died of an apparent heart attack. Witnesses described the man convulsing and writhing on the gurney, as well as struggling to speak, before officials blocked their view. It was the state's first time using a new, three-drug cocktail for an execution. Warner had been scheduled to be put the death the same day as Lockett, but his execution was stayed. ""No one wants to see another prolonged, botched execution take place, so we are greatly relieved that the Court of Criminal Appeals stayed Charles Warner's scheduled execution, as both Mr. Warner and the State requested,"" Susanna Gattoni and Seth Day, attorneys for Warner, said in a statement. ""The extreme secrecy surrounding lethal injection that led to Mr. Lockett's agonizing death must be replaced with transparency in order to ensure that executions are legal and humane,"" they said. Attorney General Scott Pruitt's office filed court documents Thursday that said he would not protest a 180-day stay to allow for the completion of the investigation. Warner's execution, which had been set for May 13, is now scheduled for November 13. Warner was convicted in 2003 for the first-degree rape and murder six years earlier of his then-girlfriend's 11-month-old daughter, Adrianna Waller.","Charles Warner's execution is now set for November 13 .

"Liberals feared that a Mitt Romney presidency could mean the end of the most significant piece of social legislation in half a century. Conservatives feared a second Obama term would allow implementation of another massive entitlement program. But for hospital administrators and businesses like health insurance companies and drug makers, the biggest fear on election night was that they would be left with an enormous mess to clean up. Although the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, won't be fully in place until 2014, billions of dollars have already been distributed and the wheels of reform have begun to turn. Seniors with Medicare prescription drug coverage are getting cash rebates. Young adults have joined their parents' insurance policies. Uninsured Americans with pre-existing conditions are getting health coverage through Obamacare programs. Some states are setting up health insurance consumer assistance bureaus and drawing up the architecture for new exchanges where private health insurance will be sold and regulated. Stopping all of that, which Romney vowed to do if not by edict then by throwing truckloads of sand in the government's regulatory gears, would have created chaos. TIME.com: Obamacare's 'health panel' The ability of critics to challenge the law's legitimacy was drastically reduced with the Supreme Court upholding its constitutionality earlier this year. But it is also important that Obama administration officials will be in charge during the law's full implementation. Hospitals, insurers, drug companies and patients can now expect a more orderly rollout of the Affordable Care Act over the next few years. As Jennifer Haberkorn reported in Politico last week, the Obama administration recently reduced the flow of new regulations defining precisely how the legislative language of Obamacare would work in practice. The purpose of holding back new rules was to avoid controversy close to the election. As Haberkorn reported, there's now a backlog of new regulations that are expected to be unveiled soon, including some that could affect wide swaths of the population. We still don't know, for example, what health services and expenses insurers will be required to cover under Obamacare. At the same time, governors will soon decide whether to set up their own health insurance marketplaces to regulate individual and small business health plans. Many Republican governors had held off making this call until after the election. States that opt not to set up exchanges will open the door for the federal government to run them instead. Thanks to a part of the Supreme Court Obamacare ruling that left the law's large Medicaid expansion as optional instead of mandatory for states, governors and state legislatures will also have to decide whether to widen eligibility for the public insurance program. (Here's a reliable timeline of Obamacare provisions and when they are scheduled to go into effect.) As Phil Galewitz reported for Kaiser Health News, some state-based Republicans may be persuaded to get on board with such pieces of the law now that it's definitely staying on the books: . ""Mike Fasano, a Republican and one of the longest serving Florida lawmakers, said with the president's win, the GOP-dominated state legislature would 'take a hard look' at expanding Medicaid — despite the opposition of Republican Gov. Rick Scott. ""Fasano, who is moving from the state Senate to the state House next year, said Florida can't afford to miss out on new revenue without having its own plan to help more than 4 million residents who lack health insurance. He acknowledged that challenging Scott would be an uphill battle but said the governor's waning popularity might embolden lawmakers."" TIME.com: What the health care decision means for the country . Despite the Affordable Care Act's more certain future under an Obama second term, controversy over the law isn't over. The public is still largely split on its merits. Republican state lawmakers and governors won't suddenly and universally back the law. Republicans in Congress still have say over funding for some of its programs. But the health care industry is now free from a great deal of uncertainty. Or at least it's free from this round of uncertainty. Any policy, business sector or law that's tangled up with politics will always retain a tinge of the unknown. See here. This article was originally published on TIME.com .

"Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is betting that the snap elections that he has called this month will bolster support for the sweeping economic reforms he has introduced since taking power in 2012. But if the gripes of small business owners like vegetable seller Kazuhiro Ooba are any gauge, Abe will have his work cut out. Ooba has turned off some of the lights in his Yokohama store to save on electricity after his bills rose 30% in a year, and he says his customers are in no mood to spend. ""The money will trickle down from big corporations, according to Prime Minister Abe,"" he says. ""Where is it? It has not reached to the people who work hard every day on the ground."" Economic woes . Abe is painting the December 14 election as a referendum on his economic policies, the much-vaunted ""three arrows"" of ""Abenomics,"" the stimulus and economic reform package upon which the leader has staked his reputation. An unexpected dip into recession has dealt his flagship economic policies a blow, however, prompting the snap election. Almost half of voters polled for two recent opinion surveys said that the economy and jobs were the main issues for them. ""The election will be held to ask the public whether we will (move) forward with Abenomics or end it,"" Abe said when announcing the closure of parliament. Campaigning for the 475 seats of the lower house of parliament that are up for grabs starts on Tuesday and polls put support for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) around 30%, and between 10% and 13% for the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the main opposition party. The LDP has been enormously successful in the postwar years, essentially having remained in power since 1955. During this period, the DPJ have only governed twice, briefly in the 1990s and again from 2009 to 2012. Strange timing . An election wasn't required until late 2016, which has led to considerable speculation as to why Abe, with a sizable majority in the lower house -- 295 out of the 475 seats -- would risk ceding power so early. E. Keith Henry, analyst and founder of Asia Strategy, a Tokyo-based government policy consultancy, told CNN he found the timing ""puzzling."" ""Why call an election when you have such a dominant position?"" Indeed, polls suggest that a majority of the public don't understand why Abe is calling an election at this time, and are critical of the cost during another period of recession. Voter turnout is expected to be low. ""There is a mental malaise in Japan which is responsible for the economic malaise (of the post-economic bubble years),"" Henry said. One rationale for the election is that Abe is simply consolidating his position before ""news gets worse,"" says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University Japan. The opposition is weak, and in disarray, he says, and now is an ideal opportunity to ""lock in a two year extension"" to the prime minister's majority in the Japan's parliament. ""There's no great time (to hold an election),"" Kingston told CNN. ""This is the least-worst time."" CNN Money: Japanese voters to give verdict on Abenomics . Place in the world . While the election is being framed largely in economic terms, Japanese voters have plenty of other concerns, including the country's energy policy. The ruling party is in favor of restarting the country's nuclear reactors -- which were mothballed in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Local city assemblymen voted in October to fire up two reactors at the Sendai power plant in Kagoshima in Japan's south. And Japanese are reflecting on their place in the world after Abe earlier this year issued a re-interpretation of Japan's pacifist constitution to allow for a greater degree of self-defence. Hardline approaches toward China traditionally appeal to Japan's voters, and tensions over maritime territorial disputes with neighbor China have intensified in recent years. The role of women in public and corporate life is also under scrutiny. The Yomiuri Shimbun, a conservative newspaper, estimates that only 184 female candidates will run in the December 14 election, about 16% of the total. Abe says that he has long championed women in the workplace, but as traditions die hard in conservative Japan, the number of married women with children and jobs remains low. Gamble . Ultimately, Abe's election gamble will only pay off if he can convince the average salaryman or woman that his  economic policies will benefit ordinary Japanese. While a key component of Abenomics has been extra government spending, a sales tax hike this year and rising costs have taken their toll on small businesses and their customers. In a bit to boost his election fortunes, Abe delayed a sales tax hike planned for October 2015. His special adviser on economic affairs Etsuro Honda, has called for a further $25 billion in cash handouts and tax cuts to kickstart the economy. But it's not clear whether this will be enough to satisfy voters. ""Abenomics is no good at all,"" said Shuichi Kobayashi, the fourth-generation owner of a 100 year-old tofu shop owner in Tokyo, who is finding recent economic conditions a threat to his livelihood. ""Our life is getting tough."" WATCH: Japan delays tax hike and calls for election .

"(CNN) -- Mexico has seen a cascade of political scandals that have shaken the country the last few months, most notably the now well-publicized bloody incident in which 43 teaching students were ""delivered"" by the Iguala city police to a drug trafficking group, who murdered them under the belief that they were sent by a rival gang. To use a cliche, it was the straw that broke the camel's back, a strong indication that Mexico's people are no longer willing to tolerate the current state of affairs. Some have suggested that the government will fall, and others have said Mexico is a failed state. The Mexican government does not appear ready to fall, not even close. But it seems to be in a defensive situation, maybe waiting for the tempest to wane so that it can regain the political initiative. It is, in many ways, a crisis of confidence. It is as if all the problems that were not attended to through history were appearing together: the impunity allowed to wrongdoers, the politicization of justice, the corruption, the perceived interaction of different levels of authorities with organized crime, the inefficiency of the police... and on and on. In other words, the wrongdoers appear to get away with murder. Right or wrong, there is the feeling that the whole system is compromised. The authorities do not appear to be able to control the violent gangs that have plagued the country for the last 10 or 15 years even if they claim that a big part of the violence has been the result of the breakdown of the major drug cartels. But then again, they do not appear to be able to contain the more or less contrived violence present in some of the protests, in the last few years. Yes, the seemingly small thievery, small vandalism in some demonstrations -- even the attempt to burn a gate to the National Palace -- pale in comparison to the drug violence that have caused more than 60,000 deaths in the last 10 years. Appearances could be misleading, but there is little help for the government in the images of apparent police impotence before the small-scale vandalism of supposed students and the increasing damages caused by so-called anarchists. It may be that the authorities will try publicly to present a merely defensive strategy, to avoid bigger problems. The country is still traumatized by the bloody repression of the 1968 students movement. The Mexico City authorities have allowed more than 2,000 demonstrations annually, for several years now, and Mexico City's inhabitants are somewhat inured to the demonstrations that do not break windows or throw a dump truck against a police barrier. Then again, the images are there. This last 12 months have been the frame for huge corruption scandals that have cost the country billions of pesos -- and cost institutions like Citigroup a few hundreds of millions of dollars; cases like Oceanografia (that defrauded PEMEX and banks equally), like Grupo Mexico (that allegedly polluted an agricultural region in Sonora state and appears rightly or wrongly to have escaped with minimal costs) and more recently the decision to overturn a bidding contest to build a railway because of the complaints of some of the international participants. These cases are more or less in the docket but people do not have confidence in our judiciary system and the legal maneuvering that it allows. And then of course, there is Iguala. The disappearance of the 43 students hit a nerve and has become an open wound in a way that is truly unprecedented.

"Stephen Colbert will succeed David Letterman as host of ""The Late Show,"" CBS announced Thursday, one week after Letterman told his audience that he would retire sometime in 2015. CBS said Colbert had signed a five-year contract to helm the iconic late-night broadcast. Colbert, 49, has been the host of Comedy Central's ""The Colbert Report"" since 2005. Will Colbert remain in his Comedy Central character? No. Colbert said in a statement, ""I won't be doing the new show in character, so we'll all get to find out how much of him was me. I'm looking forward to it."" CBS said ""specific creative elements"" would be determined and announced at a later date. Colbert has been mentioned as a possible successor to Letterman for years, and his name quickly became a consensus pick after Letterman's retirement announcement April 3. But the swiftness of the announcement was surprising. CBS said, ""Colbert's premiere date as host of 'The Late Show' will be announced after Mr. Letterman determines a timetable for his final broadcasts in 2015."" In a statement, Letterman signaled his support for CBS' choice by saying that Colbert had ""always been a real friend to me."" ""I'm very excited for him, and I'm flattered that CBS chose him,"" Letterman said. ""I also happen to know they wanted another guy with glasses."" Les Moonves, president and CEO of CBS Corp., called Colbert ""one of the most inventive and respected forces on television."" He added, ""David Letterman's legacy and accomplishments are an incredible source of pride for all of us here, and today's announcement speaks to our commitment of upholding what he established for CBS in late night."" Comedy Central also praised Colbert on Thursday, saying, ""We look forward to the next eight months of the ground-breaking 'Colbert Report' and wish Stephen the very best."" Colbert's move means he will compete with the 11:30 p.m. time slot of his current show, and he'll no longer have his friend Jon Stewart as a lead-in. Stewart, the host of ""The Daily Show,"" told New York magazine's Vulture blog on Wednesday that CBS would be wise to hire Colbert. ""He's wonderful in 'Colbert Report,' but he's got gears he hasn't even shown people yet. He would be remarkable,"" Stewart said. Colbert naturally had the last laugh in Thursday's news release. ""Simply being a guest on David Letterman's show has been a highlight of my career,"" he said. ""I never dreamed that I would follow in his footsteps, though everyone in late night follows Dave's lead. I'm thrilled and grateful that CBS chose me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go grind a gap in my front teeth."" It's David Letterman's comedy world .","Colbert premiere date to be given after Letterman makes a departure plan, CBS says .

"A voice on the intercom woke Danielle Miller and told her to put on her life jacket and run to a deck. Not knowing what the emergency was, she nervously woke up her roommate and did just that. The emergency, as she and other passengers would learn, was a fire that started in the rear of Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas cruise ship about 2:50 a.m. Monday while it was heading to the Bahamas, sending guests to the decks under the night sky. Though it never lost power, the ship was diverted to Freeport in the Bahamas, and the fire, which began in a mooring area, was extinguished just before 5 a.m., the company said. The ship's 2,224 guests and 796 crew members initially were headed to CocoCay, Bahamas, but the ship was redirected to Freeport for evaluation, Royal Caribbean said. Miller said it was a scary race topside. ""We probably ran up to that deck faster than we ever ran before,"" Miller said by phone from Freeport on Monday afternoon, a few hours after the ship docked. ""We were terrified, though, and a lot of people were just crying and freaking out."" Two guests were treated after fainting, and medical staff also responded to reports of high blood pressure and an ankle sprain, Royal Caribbean said. Five things we've learned about cruising . Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said she didn't have further information about the medical reports, ""but the ship has told us that there are no medical emergencies onboard."" The fire started on an aft mooring deck and spread to the fourth deck at the crew lounge area before it was extinguished, U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman Marilyn Fajardo said. Information on the fire's cause wasn't available, she said. Miller and the rest of the passengers will be flying home from Freeport because the company canceled the rest of the voyage Monday afternoon. Royal Caribbean said it was arranging flights to get passengers back to Baltimore, where the ship left port on Friday on a seven-night cruise. The first flight carrying cruise guests from the Bahamas left Tuesday morning, and flights will continue throughout the day, Royal Caribbean said. All passengers will receive refunds for this cruise and a certificate toward a future cruise, Royal Caribbean said. The company apologized for the stress to passengers and thanked them for their ""patience and cooperation in dealing with this unfortunate situation."" After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court? Cruise goers will miss scheduled port calls at CocoCay and Nassau in the Bahamas. CocoCay is Royal Caribbean's ""private island paradise"" in the Bahamas, according to its website. Video captured by Miller and her friend, Katie Coleman, shows guests gathered on a deck, seemingly calm, wearing orange life jackets and listening to instructions. ""We're on deck right now, 3 a.m., in our life jackets. Not a drill, not a joke,"" a narrator in Miller's video says. The ship arrived at Freeport about 10:15 a.m., Royal Caribbean said. Throughout, the power, propulsion and communications systems were uninterrupted, the company said. Cruise passengers get bill of rights . ""In an abundance of caution, the captain deemed it necessary to muster all guests at their assembly stations during the incident,"" the company said in a news release. Everyone aboard was accounted for, and guests have been allowed to return to most staterooms and public areas, it said. The company's president and CEO, Adam Goldstein, and other officials with Miami-based Royal Caribbean headed to Freeport on Monday morning to meet guests, she said. Two U.S. Coast Guard cutters escorted the Bahamian-flagged cruise ship to Freeport, the Coast Guard said. The service said that it, the National Transportation Safety Board and Bahamian officials would conduct a joint investigation to determine the fire's cause. Miller said she didn't know initially why guests were being gathered on deck. ""Before we went to bed, there was a pretty bad storm, and the ship was really rocking, so our first thought was that we were sinking, because they said 'life jackets' and run,"" Miller said. ""We got up to the deck, and we see the lifeboats being lowered down. ... We didn't know what was going on for about a half-hour, when they made an announcement that there was a fire."" Spate of fires poses problems for cruise industry . She said the crew handled the situation well. ""Even though it was terrifying, they tried their best to make everyone comfortable. They're so well-trained that I felt confident that we would be OK,"" she said. The 916-foot-long ship was launched in December 1996 and refurbished in May 2012, the company said. Several cruise ship incidents have made headlines in the past year and a half. In January 2012, 32 people died when the Costa Concordia capsized off Italy's coast. Captain in Costa Concordia accident to be tried . In February this year, an engine room fire left the Carnival Triumph adrift in the Gulf of Mexico, with passengers reporting overflowing toilets and human waste running down the walls in some parts of the ship. In March, the Carnival Dream cut short a Caribbean cruise, with Carnival reporting that the ship's emergency generator failed. And this month, authorities say, a man and a woman on the Carnival Spirit went overboard off Australia's coast; they are presumed dead.","Passengers are being flown back to Baltimore from Freeport on Tuesday, company says .
