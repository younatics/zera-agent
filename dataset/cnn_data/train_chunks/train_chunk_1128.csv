"A teenage girl who died after slipping from a railway station platform has become the latest target of internet trolls. A Facebook tribute page entitled RIP Georgia Varley was set up in memory of the 16-year-old after she was killed on Saturday night, but hours later offensive messages started appearing. One Facebook user posted: ‘Blame her heels’, while another posted a picture of . Thomas the Tank Engine with a message of his innocence. Another posted a photograph of the deceased Colonel Gaddafi alongside other highly offensive comments. Georgia Varley, 16, was returning home to Wirral on Saturday night when the tragedy happened. Some 40 to 50 passengers were on the platform at the time of the incident and a number were treated for shock. Many were posted throughout the night, leading people to believe they were coming from other countries. Friends of the teenager reported the abuse to a Facebook administrator and they have since been removed. Georgia had been returning home to . Wirral on Saturday night when she fell between the platform and one of . the carriages at Liverpool’s James Street underground station. Her friends have since set up a new page and taken Facebook advice on how to block the trolls. One post read: 'Rest In Peace, . Georgia. Hopefully no ""trolls"" will find this page, and if they do . they'll all be blocked immediately.' A shocked friend of Georgia’s wrote . on the tribute page after the ordeal: ‘Still can’t get over those people . commenting on someone innocents memorial page being horrible and . mocking a young death.' The user who set up the tribute page . wrote: ‘Thank you all for being so patient with the removal of the . horrible comments and thank you all for continuing to post happy . memories and messages to Georgia and to her friends and family. Tribute page: The offensive posts were removed from the Facebook page and friends defended Georgia Varley . RIP Georgia Varley Facebook page: The internet troll's messages were removed . ‘I hope no one believes that these . events have tarnished Georgia’s memory in anyway as we all know she was a . lovely, happy and smiley young girl who was loved dearly and will . forever be loved dearly.’ It is thought that Georgia had . been running along the platform after a Wirral-bound train after a night . out in Liverpool with friends and family when she fell at around . 11:30pm. It is believed that some of the party were already on board the train, which had begun to move away from the station. Up to 50 passengers waiting on the . platform watched on in horror as the teenager slipped under the wheels . and was killed instantly. Some have been treated for shock . Her boyfriend, named locally as Pierce, was ‘devastated’ and Georgia’s family are being comforted by friends and relatives. The incident happened at the underground James Street Station in the centre of the city . Friends have paid tribute to the teenager on a Facebook tribute page, describing her as 'beautiful', 'a princess', and 'a gorgeous girl' Georgia’s father Paul, of New Brighton, described her daughter as his 'precious angel'. He said: 'Georgia was just amazing. I have a constant lump in my throat and I don't know how to feel or what to say. 'She was so loved and she never had an upside down smile on. She was such a happy girl. 'I would say to her 'you're always changing between groups of friends' but she made an impression on so many people.' A spokesman for Facebook said: 'It is . against Facebook's rules to intimidate or harass others, and we provide . everyone with the tools to report such content via specific links . across every page of our site. One tribute to the teenager said: 'You brought so much joy into all of our lives. There was never a day where you didn't make me laugh. You're my superstar."" 'When abuse is reported to us, we react swiftly, and we will disable accounts that are found to be in breach of our terms. 'We strongly encourage people using Facebook to use our tools whenever needed and to report objectionable content so we can investigate reports and take action.' The spokesman said that 'trolling' was not exclusive to Facebook but that they had set up an 'extensive reporting network' to help combat the problem. It comes after Sean Duffy was imprisoned for 18 weeks after leaving obscene messages and videos on a condolence page set up by the family of 15-year-old schoolgirl Natasha MacBryde, who committed suicide. He was also charged over 'offensive images' on a Facebook tribute page set up for Sophie Taylor, who was accidentally shot dead by her boyfriend in April. It is still unknown exactly what happened on Saturday night when Georgia was tragically killed at James Street station. One theory is that the teenager may have . accidentally stepped off the train at the wrong stop and ran to try to . get back on before losing her step and falling from the platform. British Transport Police were yesterday continuing with their investigations into the events which led to Georgia's death. Detective . Chief Inspector Simon Taylor said: 'We are determined to work out . exactly what happened to Georgia and I am calling on rail passengers in . Liverpool to help with this. 'Whatever . information you have, no matter how insignificant it may seem, it could . prove valuable in helping us piece together Georgia's final few . minutes. 'Georgia has left . behind a distraught family and we want to be able to tell them exactly . what happened and help them come to terms with the tragedy.' Most of Georgia's friends were on half term this week and will return to school on Monday. Staff at Birkenhead Sixth Form College, where Georgia was a student, were planning counselling for friends and those who witnessed her death. Karen Wiggins, a senior member of staff, said: 'We are all deeply saddened. Georgia joined us in September and had a bright future ahead of her. 'She had a very ready smile and was a beautiful looking girl who was very popular among the students.'",Tribute page for Georgia Varley was targeted just hours after being put up .
"A mentally-ill woman in a coma is allegedly being pursued by government workers to assess her fitness to work. Sheila Holt, who is bipolar, had been receiving income support - but was sectioned under the Mental Health Act last month after becoming terrified when the payments were removed, her family claim. Now, the 47-year-old woman from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, has been sent a letter by government-contracted healthcare company ATOS to find out whether she can gain employment. Coma: Sheila Holt, 47, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act . Her family claim Ms Holt became terrified and suffered a breakdown when her benefits were withdrawn, before having a heart attack. They say she has been in a coma for more than a month. But ATOS - which is used by the Department for Work and Pensions to assess those suitable for work under a benefits provision shake-up - now wants to assess her fitness to work. Her family said a long-standing mental health disorder has meant she has never worked. Her case has now been taken up by Labour’s Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, who has visited her in hospital. Political influence: Sheila Holt's case has been taken up by Labour's Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk . He said the Government’s welfare reforms and the controversial Work Capability Assessment handled by ATOS were being ‘bulldozed through in an incompetent and insensitive way’. Mr Danczuk added that Ms Holt had recently come off psychiatric treatment and been pushed onto the work programme, despite her family arguing that she could not work because of her mental illness. He said: ‘From day one the approach by the Department of Work and Pensions has been clumsy and horribly misguided. 'I accept reform is not easy. But there has to be a smarter and more compassionate way of differentiating between those that cannot work and those that do not want to work. 'I am in favour of welfare reform but trying to bulldoze through changes in a reckless and insensitive way is not the right way to go about it.’ The MP said he feared Ms Holt’s experience was being repeated elsewhere in the country. Ms Holt’s father Kenneth, who released the photograph published by MailOnline of his daughter in a coma, said her prognosis ‘was not good’ - but vowed that he would not give up hope of her regaining consciousness. He said: ‘We feel the coalition’s changes to the welfare system are grossly unfair to a section of the community with mental health issues.’ Tragic: Fairlfield hospital (pictured) where Sheila Holt is currently in a coma . Atos Healthcare spokesperson said: 'Our thoughts are with the family of Ms Holt at this difficult time and we are sorry for any further distress caused. 'When an application for benefit is made we receive a referral from the Department for Work and Pensions will automatically issue the standardised ESA50 claim form so that a claim for benefit can be made. 'Where we know of a change in circumstances either through the DWP or the family we will return the referral to the Department and not send any correspondence.' Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants are expected to actively look for employment and attend an assessment after 13 weeks out of work. If the claimants are struggling with their search, they should  develop skills and experience to help them find work, and are expected to 'work for their benefits', even if it means working for free. Otherwise, their benefits might stop. However, it may be possible to get hardship payments whilst their Jobseeker’s Allowance is stopped. Claimants should ask their Jobcentre to find out.","Sheila Holt, who is bipolar, lost her income support and 'became terrified'

"Cashpoints around the world could be left vulnerable to hacker attacks. It is believed millions are still running Microsoft's Windows XP, first introduced 13 years ago. However, on April 8th, Microsoft will stop issuing securoty updates, in a bid to get people to upgrade. Bill Gates at the Microsoft XP launch in New York October 25, 2001: The firm will finally stop supporting the software on April 8th. Cumbersome and slow cash machines with clunky buttons and tiny hard-to-see screens could soon be a thing of the past thanks to a range of next-generation ATMs. Ohio-based security firm Diebold has created a touchscreen cash machine that works like a tablet computer, uses facial recognition and QR codes to identify and authenticate users, and has built-in safety cameras. German-based engineers at Wincor Nixdorf have developed a machine that remembers the user's withdrawal history to offer more personalised options.

Experts say many of the ATMs may have to be dumped, and that 95% of ATMs in use runs windows XP. 'My bank operates an ATM that looks like it must be 20 years old, and there’s no way that it can support Windows 7,' Suzanne Cluckey, the editor of ATM Marketplace, a news site that serves the industry, told Bloomberg. 'A lot of ATMs will have to either have their components upgraded or be discarded altogether and sold into the aftermarket—or just junked.' although more modern ATMs are unaffected, there are fears older version could be left vulnerable . Experts say that as little as 15% of ATMs run on Windows 7, and warn the industry faces major problems. Aravinda Korala, chief executive officer of ATM software provider KAL, says he expects only 15 percent of bank ATMs in the U.S. to be on Windows 7 by the April deadline.

"The Secret Service was unaware for four days that a man had fired a high-powered rifle at the White House in 2011 in a 'fumbled' response that left the Obamas furious, says a new report. Officers allegedly performed a string of security lapses after Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez shot at least seven bullets at the executive mansion in Washington from his car. At the time, President Barack Obama, his wife Michelle and their older daughter Malia were not at home, but their younger daughter Sasha and Mrs Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, were inside. It comes as the Secret Service is facing more questions over its ability to protect the first family after a knife-wielding man jumped the White House fence and made it to the front doors last Friday. Scroll down for videos . Gunman: Secret Service officers allegedly performed a string of security lapses after Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez (pictured) fired at least seven bullets at the White House in Washington from his car in 2011 . Damage: Ortega-Hernandez, then 21, parked his black Honda south of the White House, before pointing his gun at the home of the Obamas and firing off a series of bullets. Above, officers inspect a smashed window . Broken: One of the bullets smashed a window on the second floor, just inches from the family's living room . First family: At the time, President Barack Obama (left), his wife Michelle (far right) and their older daughter Malia (second right) were not at the executive mansion, but younger daughter Sasha (third right) was inside . The agency's apparently bungled response to the shooting on November 11, 2011, was detailed last night in an investigation by The Washington Post. In the incident, Ortega-Hernandez, then 21, parked his black Honda south of the mansion, before pointing his semi-automatic pistol out of the passenger window. He then aimed it directly at the Obamas' home and fired off a series of bullets, one of which smashed a window on the second floor, just inches from the family's living room. Another bullet got stuck in a window frame, while others smashed into the roof, causing nearly $100,000 worth of damage. Within seconds of the shots, a White House usher reportedly expressed concerns about the safety of Malia, who was due to arrive back at the mansion imminently. The usher told the staff to keep her sister Sasha and Ms Robinson inside, before locking all of the doors after Malia returned with her detail at 9.40pm, the Post said. Attack: Within seconds of the shots, a White House usher expressed concerns about the safety of Malia, who was due to arrive back at the mansion imminently, according to a new report by the Washington Post . Weapon: Secret Service officers, in accordance with protocol, rushed to respond, before they were reportedly told 'No shots have been fired... stand down', by their supervisor. Above, the gun used by Ortega-Hernandez . Fleeing: Ortega-Hernandez is pictured allegedly fleeing from Washington aboard a freight train in this 2011 photo introduced by U.S. prosecutors as evidence in Federal Court in Washington . Meanwhile, Secret Service officers, in accordance with protocol, rushed to respond, with one stationed under the second-floor terrace withdrawing her handgun. However, they reportedly halted their response when they were wrongly informed, 'No shots have been fired... stand down', by their supervisor. The supervisor claimed the noise had instead stemmed from the backfire from a nearby construction vehicle, the Post said. Even after the fact that shots were fired had been confirmed,  supervisors initially theorized that rival gangs in separate cars had gotten into a gunfight near the mansion's front lawn, it said. Executive mansion: It apparently took the Secret Service four days to conclude that gunshots had struck the White House (pictured) - with their findings mainly based on the discovery of broken glass by a housekeeper . The shots were reportedly only connected to the White House four days later when a housekeeper noticed broken glass and a chunk of cement lying on the floor inside. Less than a week later, Mrs Obama, who had arrived back in Washington from Hawaii after spending the Veterans Day weekend with her husband, reportedly arranged a meeting with then-Secret Service Director Dan Sullivan. During the encounter, she addressed Mr Sullivan so sharply that she could be heard through a closed door, the Post reported. Angry: President Obama was 'infuriated' by the Secret Service's response to the shooting . President Obama, who was continuing from Hawaii to Australia, was also said to have been 'infuriated' by the Secret Service's response to the shooting. One day after the broken glass was spotted, Ortega-Hernandez, from Idaho, was arrested. He was later sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to firing an assault rifle at the White House. Although prosecutors had initially charged Ortega-Hernandez with attempting to assassinate President Obama, they agreed to drop the charge as part of a plea deal last year. The Post alleges that some Secret Service officers knew immediately that shots had been fired into the White House, but that they were 'largely ignored'. 'Some were afraid to dispute their bosses' conclusions' that the shooting was not directed at the White House, it said. The agency allegedly conducted only a cursory inspection of the White House for evidence or damage, while key witnesses were not interviewed until after bullets were found. The suspect was able to park his car on a public street, take several shots and then speed off without being detected, the Post noted. It added that it was 'sheer luck' that Ortega was identified as the shooter, mainly because the troubled and jobless 21-year-old wrecked his car seven blocks away and left his gun inside. The recent allegations were unearthed by the Post following interviews with agents, investigators and government officials, as well as the review of hundreds of documents. It comes just a week after Omar Gonzalez, 42, was arrested inside the Presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn, the Secret Service said. President Obama and his family were not in the mansion at the time. Previous incident: Last week, Omar Gonzalez, 42, was arrested inside the Presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn (pictured), the Secret Service said . White House pair: Gonzalez, a 42-year-old Iraq veteran (left) and Kevin Carr, a 19-year-old college student (right) were both arrested after trying to get into the White House within 24 hours of one another . Less than 24 hours later, Kevin Carr, 19, was taken in by officers after allegedly driving a car up to a screening point then refusing to leave when he was asked. The two attempts to gain entry to the White House prompted the Secret Service to increase security by stepping up patrols around the building. It has been suggested they could set up security checkpoints around the building for the public. In a statement to the Associated Press, the Secret Service said it 'implemented both personnel and structural enhancements' following a review of the 2011 incident. It also employed 'other physical and technical enhancements, including additional surveillance cameras.' A Secret Service official, who requested anonymity for lack of authorization to comment for attribution, said the delay in understanding what happened that night was not the result of misconduct or incompetence. Instead, they said it was 'an uncertain situation' that included echoing shots from a quarter mile away and confused initial witness reports. 'I'm not saying this was our shining moment, but we never stopped looking for this guy,' the official said.","Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez fired at least seven bullets at White House .

"The U.S. is bracing itself for freezing temperatures and snow as a polar vortex heads southwards - bringing temperatures that are expected to plunge 10- to 20-degrees below normal. The mild weather much currently being experienced in much of the country is forecast to end on Sunday, when a vast pocket of extremely cold air will hit the Central and Eastern States and keep them in its icy grip until Friday. A polar vortex is a massive cyclone that circles the planet's geographical poles. The Northern Hemisphere vortex often contains two extremely cold low pressure centres, one near Baffin Island, Canada, and the other over northeast Siberia in Russia. Enjoy it while it lasts: The current spell of mild weather in the U.S. will come to an end on Sunday as the polar vortex sweeps south, forecasters say. Pictured, Marie Kim, left, 8, plays with her sister Jaime, 5,  in Redding, California . Occasionally, this area of frigid air can get dislodged farther south than usual, leading to cold outbreaks in Canada and the U.S. Parts of New England near the Canadian border from New York to Maine could see some snowfall. AccuWeather Long Range Expert Paul Pastelok said: 'Areas from the northern and central Plains to the Great Lakes, the upper Gulf Coast and the Appalachians will feel significant impact from the arctic outbreak.' Worst hit will be Fargo, North Dakota, and the cities of Minneapolis, Chicago, St. Louis and Cincinnati. Americans are warned to take steps to combat hypothermia and frostbite in the north, and southern states are being urged to break out the winter coats. 'It is possible single-digit low temperatures occur in parts of the northern Plains and the Upper Midwest, away from the Great Lakes with temperatures plunging to 20 degrees below average in parts of the South,' Mr Pastelok said. Cold air passing over the relatively warm waters of the Great Lakes will result in localised snow and squalls from the Upper Midwest to the interior Northeast. Mr Pastelok said: 'A broad area of snow on the ground would result in significantly lower temperatures.'

"The world’s richest man is calling for a radical overhaul of our work-life balance that would see people at their jobs for just three days a week. Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecom tycoon worth over $80 billion, also believes people that the typical working day should last 11 hours instead of eight and that the retirement age should be increased to 75. ‘You should have more time for you during all of your life - not when you're 65 and retired,’ he told CNNMoney. Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecom tycoon worth over $80 billion, believes people that the typical working day should last 11 hours instead of eight and that the retirement age should be increased to 75 . The 74-year-old billionaire first raised the idea at a conference in Paraguay during the summer when he called for 'a radical overhaul' in people's working lives. He believes the concept would not only re-invigorate how we live, but be positive for the economy and financial markets. 'With three work days a week, we would have more time to relax; for quality of life,' he said. 'Having four days [off] would be very important to generate new entertainment activities and other ways of being occupied,' he told the conference. While machines should operate 24 hours a day and services should work as much as possible, Slim said people deserve more time for entertainment, family and to train for better jobs. 'It's a society of knowledge and experience. You have better experience and knowledge when you are 60, 65 and 70,' he said. Slim's vision of the future has machines operating 24 hours a day and people spending more time on entertainment, family and training for better jobs . Slim wasn't clear if wages should stay the same or decrease to reflect less time on the job. He declined to throw his weight behind recent calls for workers to get paid higher wages though. He conceded prices may have grown faster than wages, but he believes salaries will rise along with stronger growth, increased productivity and technological advances. ‘I am sure it will happen,’ said Slim, although he conceded he's not exactly sure when. To a certain degree, Slim has been applying this train of thought to his own businesses for years. Slim's phone company Telmex has implemented a system where workers on a collective labor contract who joined the company in their late teens can retire before they reach 50, and can continue to work for full pay four days per week. Slim also applies this philosophy to his own work life and is still active as a businessman at 74. He also maintains a life full of hobbies, such as art collecting. He opened the Museo Soumaya, an art museum dedicated to both his love for art and religious relics as well as the memory of his late wife, Soumaya Domit.","Carlos Slim predicts a future where the work-life balance shifts in favor of more time spent with family, on entertainment and training for better jobs .

"Viagra could cause blindness in men with eye problems, and even those with seemingly normal vision, a new study has found. Australian researchers say an ingredient in  anti-impotence drugs may permanently affect the vision of men with an inherited eye condition. It could also affect those with normal sight who carry one gene which is linked with developing eye problems. Scroll down for video . Viagra could cause blindness in men with inherited eye condition retinitis pigmentosa - or those with normal sight who carry the gene for the condition, Australian researchers have found . One theory is that erectile dysfunction drugs may obstruct an enzyme which is important for transmitting light signals from the retina to the brain. It is already known that sildenafil, the active ingredient in the erectile dysfunction medication, can cause temporary vision problems in some healthy people. Doctors have  now warned it could also cause permanent damage to the eyes of people retinitis pigmentosa. People with normal sight that carry the gene for the condition may also be at risk, experts warn. Retinitis pigmentosa is a rare hereditary condition that causes the cells in the retina - the area of the back of the eye which detects light - to degenerate and die. This can lead to difficulty seeing in dim light, loss of peripheral vision, and sometimes blindness. About one in 50 people are likely to be carriers of genes which lead to the degeneration of cells in the retina. Loss of hearing . In 2011, Viagra and similar impotence drugs were linked to hundreds of cases of sudden hearing loss around the world. Research published in the journal The Laryngoscope said it was not clear how long the problems lasted, but this type of hearing loss - more commonly due to infections and exposure to loud noise - usually causes permanent damage in up to a third of cases. Skin cancer . Earlier this year, American researchers found that men who used Viagra were 84 per cent more likely to get melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. It is thought the impotence drug may affect the same genetic mechanism that enables skin cancer to become more invasive. In the new study, researchers from the University of New South Wales, Australia,  tested sildenafil on healthy mice and mice with one copy of this mutant gene. They found the healthy mice experienced problems with their eyes for about two days. However the drug affected the vision of mice who carried the mutant gene for two weeks. The researchers also found early signs that the cells in the mice's eyes were dying, suggesting sildenafil may cause loss of vision in people who carry the gene for the disease but have normal vision. Dr Lisa Nivison-Smith, of the UNSW School of Optometry and Vision Science, said: 'If cells actually die in the retina that would lead to blindness.' People who have normal vision, but who carry a single copy of the mutant gene for retinitis pigmentosa, could be more susceptible to changes caused by sildenafil, she added. The study was published in the journal Experimental Eye Research.The news comes after reports that Britain is braced for a 'Viagra boom' after the drug's patent ran out last year. The cost plummeted by 93 per cent as cheaper generic versions of the drug became available. Previous studies have linked Viagra and other anti-impotence drugs to side effects such as deafness. American researchers also found that men who used Viagra increased their risk of developing skin cancer.

"Nearly seven in 10 Americans believe the United States should shut its doors to foreigners traveling from countries that have seen cases of the Ebola virus, and six in 10 say there should be a total ban on incoming travel for everyone – including Americans – who want to enter the U.S. Republicans are overwhelmingly against issuing travel visas to people who have been to the Ebola hot zone, with 90 per cent favoring the no-room-at-the-inn approach. Older Americans also preferred a closed-door policy by large numbers. The GOP also leads the field in asking for travel restrictions on anyone entering the U.S. from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. More than three-fourths of Republicans hold that view, compared with barely half of Democrats. Republicans also far outstrip Democrats on the question of 21-day forced quarantines for those entering the U.S. from affected countries. Two-thirds of GOPers think isolating potential patients is a must-do. Barely one in three Democrats agree. The stunning results come from a MailOnline/YouGov poll that surveyed 1,000 Americans, suggesting they're eager to see the Obama White House embrace the position of Australia – which shut its borders last Tuesday to all travelers from Ebola-stricken nations – and of Canada, which followed suit on Friday. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE FULL POLLING RESULTS . CLOSE THE BORDERS: Significant majorities of Americans believe no one Ebola-land should be allowed to enter the U.S. – not even Americans who have traveled to the worst-hit countries . VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE: Just 34 per cent of Americans say they have faith in President Barack Obama to manage the Ebola crisis the right way moving forward . SLOW AND STEADY WINS A GIANT RASPBERRY: The Obama administration should have been quicker on the uptake when Ebola first hit the U.S., according to 55 per cent of Americans, while just 29 per cent say the White House wasn't too slow to act . Americans overall are split on the question of mandatory Ebola quarantines, with 48 per cent saying they believe 'people who have been to Ebola-infected areas should be quarantined by the government for 21 days.' Another 29 per cent believe only those showing symptoms of the disease should be forced into isolation. Older Americans are the most likely to demand quarantines.Fully 57 per cent of Americans 65 or older fall into that camp, compared to just 41 per cent of those age 18 to 29. And Republicans are 75 per cent more likely than Democrats to insist that the government isolate travels who have been to west Africa. The Obama administration gets low marks for its handling of the crisis. Just 10 per cent of Americans approve of the job 'Ebola czar' Ron Klain is doing, with 40 per cent saying they have never heard of him. Only 2 per cent of Republicans say he's doing a good job, but Democrats don't support him either. Less than one in five of them approve of Klain's work on the issue. Fewer Republicans than Democrats – 24 to 44 per cent – have no idea who he is, an indication that Klain, a longtime Democratic political operative, has become a lightning rod on the right. Fully 54 per cent of Americans age 29 and under say they have no idea who he is. RON KLAIN WHO? Obama's 'Ebola czar' isn't exactly a rousing success, with 40 per cent of Americans saying they've never heard of him and just 10 per cent saying he's doing a good job . MEDICAL SCHIZOPHRENIA: While more than half of Americans approve of encouraging doctors and nurses to donate their talents in Ebola-stricken nations, a similar majority thinks that same volunteerism puts public health at risk back in the United States . Fifty-five percent – including 61 per cent of Republicans but just 13 per cent of Democrats – agree that the administration has been 'slow to react.' African-Americans match Democrats' 13 per cent showing, largely supporting the White House. Obama himself only wins plaudits from 34 per cent of the U.S. population, compared with 49 per cent who disapprove of how he's handling it. Not surprisingly, just 10 per cent of Republicans approve of how the president has responded to the Ebola crisis. Perhaps more shocking is that 35 per cent of Democrats wouldn't agree. Obama continues to be a racially polarizing figure as he tackles the public-health threat, the MailOnline/YouGov poll shows, with 51 per cent of blacks, 46 per cent of Hispanics, but just 29 per cent of whites backing him. A similar split dominated the question of whether Americans 'have faith' in the president to handle the problem moving forward. Fifty-eight percent of blacks say they do, compared to 29 per cent of whites. Just 16 percent of blacks have their doubts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which drew jeers for allowing an Ebola-infected nurse to fly on commercial aircraft, has the support of 39 per cent of Americans, four percentage points lower than the 43 per cent who disapprove of its performance. GOP HARD-LINERS: More than two-thirds of Republicans told YouGov's pollsters that they believe the federal government should forcibly quarantine people who enter the US after spending time in Ebola-affected nations . DEMOCRATIC SOFTIES: Fully 62 per cent of Democrats believe there's no need for a 21-day quarantine when people enter the country from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea . The Obama White House has assumed a leading role in the global fight against the deadly disease, which has infected more than 10,000 people in Africa. But barely one-third of Americans say the public-health mop-up is the responsibility of the United States. Nearly half say it's not. The administration's efforts have included deploying military men and women by the thousands to help build field hospitals in Liberia and build other critical infrastructure. The CDC has also encouraged scientists and medical personnel to volunteer their time and skills in the Ebola hot zone. But while more than half of Americans think it's a good idea to nudge doctors and nurses toward western Africa, they feel the opposite about uniformed servicemen and women. Younger Americans, those under age 29, are the most likely to have their doubts about putting a lab-coated cadre of temperature-takers in harm's way. Just 44 per cent of them approve and one-third are undecided – making them the largest demographic group to be scratching their heads over the question. Most of the U.S. medical volunteers who have served or are serving overseas combating Ebola are under age 30, according to a physician source at Doctors Without Borders, an international medical relief charity. A clear majority, 53 per cent, say the federal government should not be 'sending military personnel to Ebola-infected areas of Africa to help battle the disease.' That number includes 67 per cent of Republicans but just 40 per cent of Democrats, an unusual case where dovish liberals prefer to deploy troops and hawkish conservatives would rather not. Just three in 10 overall approve of the Pentagon's deployments. 34 PER CENT FOR OBAMA: The president barely has one-third of Americans behind him as he battles the Ebola scourge, and nearly one-half disapprove of how he's handling it . RESERVING JUDGMENT ON CHRIS CHRISTIE: The pugnacious New Jersey governor who insists his quarantine policy is the right path has left nearly 2 in 5 Americans unsure what to think – but he's winning over more than he's offending . CDC GAP AT FIVE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a five point approval-gap on Ebola, with 39 per cent saying the agency is doing well and 44 per cent disagreeing – and among those with strong feelings, the dissenters outnumber the applauders nearly two-to-one . The thorny question of what happens to Americans who have been exposed to the Ebola virus is still vexing the Obama administration. Already more than 100 military personnel, including a commanding major general, have entered 21-day quarantines on an military base in Italy – to the consternation of the Italian military stationed there. And nurse Kaci Hickox's refusal to remain isolated during the disease's potential incubation period became national news after she returned from Africa via the Newark, New Jersey airport. She had a 101-degree fever when she was tested hours after her arrival. Hickox spent three days in a hospital isolation tent before the CDC cleared her to go home to the far northern reaches of Maine. She has defied public health authorities since then by taking bike rides and strolls, shaking hands with reporters – including one from MailOnline – and doing her own shopping. The MailOnline/YouGov poll found that more than half of Americans believe that by giving a green light to medical volunteers, the federal government 'could increase the risk of Ebola being brought to the United States.' BRING THEM HOME: A majority of Americans think it was a mistake to send military servicemen and women to western Africa, where they have been building field hospitals and providing infrastructure help – but also potentially exposing them to the deadly Ebola virus . INSIDE THE NUMBERS: Democrats who approve of sending soldiers into Ebola's path far outnumber Republicans who back that approach . NOT OUR PROBLEM: Just 36 percent of poll respondents said they agree that it's America's job to lead the global Ebola response, while 48 percent said it's not . This week Hickox and the Obama administration both crossed swords with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a feisty Republican who refused to back down from his insistence that health care workers who show disease symptoms must be quarantined before they can enter the interior of the U.S. from the Newark airport. Obama objected, blaming Christie – although not by name – for stoking fear by adopting a more stringent disease control regime than the CDC's, and the White House may have the public-opinion upper hand. Only one-third of Americans say they approve of Christie's approach. --- . YouGov polled 1,000 Americans on October 29 and 30. The poll has a margin of error of ±4.3 percentage points.

"Blackmailers have threatened to release the deadly Ebola virus in the Czech Republic unless its government pays them one million euros in Bitcoin. The Bond villain-style threat was issued by anonymous emails to the highest offices of the Czech government which were then passed on to the Czech media. The blackmailers' demand warned that failure to comply with 'any of our requests will lead to the spreading of the infected material in Prague and other cities. The Vlatva River, Prague: Blackmailers have threatened to release the Ebola virus in Prague and other Czech cities unless the Czech Republic's government pays them one million euros in the untraceable Bitcoin currency . 'If you don't answer this letter, we will send press releases to media and inform people on social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and Youtube to let them know how negligent the Czech offices are.' The blackmailers claim they have the Ebola virus from Liberia and they are ready to spread it if they do not get one million Euros. They instructed officials to divide the money into three payments. The first was supposed to be paid on Monday, a second on Wednesday, and a third after they hand over the infected material. Bitcoin is an electronic currency often preferred by blackmailers because it allows them to receive funds that cannot be frozen or reversed by conventional methods once they have been sent. Known as a 'cryptocurrency' because it uses strong encryption to secure transactions, it also provides anonymity. The blackmailers can be almost anywhere in the world to receive the cash. Czech police have not cooperated with the demands and have said they are not taking the letters and blackmailing very seriously. 'We have been investigating the case as a blackmailing,' said Czech police president deputy Zdenek Laube. 'The anonymous individual has blackmailed the Czech Republic by claiming they will spread the Ebola virus in public places. 'The only intention of the blackmailers is to cause a panic.' Danger? The Czech Republic's chief sanitary officer, Vladimir Valenta, said spreading the Ebola virus would not actually be very easy in his country because the climate precludes 'massive Ebola spreading' The has been a slowing of the spread Ebola in Liberia, the country hardest hit by the outbreak, the World Health Organisation said. New cases in the country have been falling for more than a week, the UN health body noted. But officials warned they weren't sure if there were really fewer cases. People may have stopped going to the hospital or overwhelmed medical staff may have simply stopped reporting them as diligently, said Bruce Aylward, the WHO's assistant director-general in charge of operational response. 'It appears the trend is real in Liberia,' Aylward said. 'There may indeed be a slowing of the epidemic there.' According to Czech detectives the blackmailers used very sophisticated means of communication, making it difficult to trace them. If found guilty they may be sentenced up to 12 years of jail. Chief sanitary officer Vladimir Valenta said: 'Spreading the Ebola virus is not very probable in Czech Republic.' He also said that possible transport of the virus to the Czech Republic is not very realistic and that the Czech climate 'excludes massive Ebola spreading'. Czech Prime minister Bohuslav Sobotka also commented: 'This is a shocking misuse of the current public concern over Ebola in Europe.' 'The police are investigating the case. The government doesn't want to underestimate the situation but we don't want to overestimate it though.'","Bond villain-style threat issued via email to Czech government and press .

"Walmart says actor-comedian Tracy Morgan and other people in a vehicle struck from behind by a company truck on a New Jersey highway in June weren't wearing seatbelts and therefore to blame for their own injuries. Walmart's filing was made Monday in federal court in response to a lawsuit Morgan, and the other passengers in his limo bus, filed in July. Morgan's friend James McNair was killed in the crash while accompanying the 45-year-old former 'Saturday Night Live' and '30 Rock' star back from a show in Delaware. Morgan spent several weeks in rehab with rib and leg injuries. Scroll down for video . His fault? Walmart is blaming Tracy Morgan for the injuries he sustained in June when a Walmart truck slammed into his limo bus .

Pictured on the left using a walker in New York with his fianceé Megan Wollover (left) in July. Morgan's friend and fellow comedian James MacNair (right) died in the accident . Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart Stores Inc. says the passengers' injuries were caused by their 'failure to properly wear an appropriate available seatbelt restraint device,' which it says constitutes unreasonable conduct. If they had been wearing a restraint, Walmart argues that 'all or a portion of the injuries could have been diminished or minimized.' An attorney representing Morgan and the other plaintiffs hasn't commented. Walmart didn't respond to claims that their driver, Kevin Roper, hadn't slept in more than 24 hours before the crash. The company did admit though that Morgan and his friends' injuries 'may have been caused by third parties over whom Walmart had no control.' After the deadly crash, Roper was charged with causing the accident. Investigators believe he was dozing off behind the wheel in the moments before the collision and didn't see the traffic ahead of him until it was too late. '[The] driver failed to observe slow-moving traffic ahead,' New Jersey State Police Sgt. First Class Gregory Williams said. 'He observed at the last minute -- just prior to impact -- the limo bus carrying Morgan and his party.'

"Carrying a guitar can increase the chances of you getting a date by a third, according to a study by researchers from the University of South Brittany. The study found that women were 31% more likely to give their number to a man carrying a guitar - double the amount of people who would give their number to the same man when he was empty-handed. But this technique only works if your a man, women are not seen any more or less attractive if they carry a musical instrument. According to a study by French researchers in Brittany, men who carry guitars are seen as more attractive than sporty-looking men. Carrying an instrument can boost your chances of getting a date by 31% . Researchers Mary Cowan from the University of Stirling, and Anthony Little filmed 40 psychology students - half men and half women - explaining which two items they'd take to a desert island and why, choosing from chocolate, hairspray or a plastic bag. Even though they hadn't been told about humour, 19 of the 40 students tried to be funny in their responses. The next 11 students were played audio recordings of these 19 participants and asked to rate them for funniness, and for the attractiveness. The magazine revealed that 'a key result is that attractive actors were judged to be funnier.' It added 'men who were considered funnier also tended to be considered more attractive for both short and long term relationships but especially short term.' The study was led by Professor Nicolas Gueguen, a researcher in behavioural sciences at the University. Gueguen hired a 20-year-old man to approach 300 women aged between 18 and 22 in a shopping centre in Brittany. The man told each girl that they were 'really pretty' and asked for her phone number so they could arrange a date. For the first 100 women he was holding a sports bag. For the next 100 women he approached them holding a guitar case. And for the final 100 women, the man asked them for their number without anything in his hands. When the actor was carrying the guitar case, 31% of the women gave them his number. When he was carrying nothing, 14% of the women gave them his number. The biggest turn off for the women was when he was carrying the sports bag, which had a success rate of only 9%. According to research from the University of . South Brittany, women are 31% likely to give a man their phone number . when he's carrying a guitar. The biggest turn off for women is men . carrying sports bags . English singer and musician David Bowie topped the list of the 20 sexiest male musicians of all time, according to LA Weekly. The 66-year-old has been married twice. His current wife is Somalian fashion model Iman Abdulmajid . According to Guitar World, the top ten songs which all budding musicians must learn if they want to impress a woman are: . 1. More Than Words - Extreme . 2. Crash - Dave Matthews Band . 3. Melissa - Allman Brothers Band . 4. Just Like Heaven - The Cure . 5. Name - Goo Goo Dolls . 6. Wonderful Tonight - Eric Clapton . 7. You And Me - Lifehouse . 8. Baby I Love Your Way - Peter Frampton . 9. Your Body Is a Wonderland - John Mayer . 10. Babe, I’m Gonna Leave You - Led Zeppelin . Gueguen's findings mirror those from a study carried out by the University of Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion University last year. In the Israeli study, 100 single women were sent Facebook friend requests with a message that said: 'I like your photo'. Half of the respondents were sent a request by a man seen strumming a guitar in his profile picture. The other half were sent a request from the same person, but this time he was empty handed. Only five (10%) of the 50 women accepted the request, or replied to the message sent by the empty-handed man. Yet 28% accepted the request, or replied to the message sent by the man holding a guitar. The French researchers attribute these findings to the fact that playing a musical instrument is a sign that the man is intelligent, can learn, or is willing to learn, new skills and has independent hobbies. They believe there may also be a link between how musicans are portrayed in the media, and that holding a guitar is a sign of wealth and status. The team from the University of South Brittany also wanted to test whether the same theory was true when it came to female musicians. Gueguen's team repeated the Israeli study, but used females to send the friend requests. He found there was no difference in the response rate of the men she sent requests to whether she was holding a guitar or not. This suggests that its only women who consider playing an instrument to be an attractive trait.","Women are 31% more likely to give their number to a man carrying a guitar .

"Health officials say 14 states now have respiratory illnesses caused by an uncommon virus — enterovirus 68 which is marked by severe breathing problems and will continue to infect children in more states. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials say Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania together have 130 lab-confirmed cases. As of Wednesday both Minnesota and New Jersey also have confirmed cases of the severe virus. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Sweeping the nation: This map shows 12 or the 14 confirmed states (not including Minnesota and New Jersey) where enterovirus D 68 has caused a surge of severe respiratory disease . A child in Minnesota is confirmed to have the virus and hospitals in the region have been flooded with children complaining of serious breathing difficulties. The Star Tribune reports that The Children’s hospitals in Minneapolis and St. Paul have been averaging a combined total of around 300 children transferred to inpatient care each day for the past week. An entire fourth of those children are suffering respiratory problems and were right to seek hospitalization, says Children’s chief nursing officer Roxanne Fernandes. 'One little boy about 6 years old told me it was like having an elephant sitting on his chest,” Fernandez said. 'And so when you’re having that much trouble breathing, we really want you to be here,' she added. The New York Daily News reports that a case of the virus has been confirmed in New Jersey on Wednesday. The child's condition has since improved after being discharged from the hospital. There are also suspected cases in Georgia, Michigan, Ohio and Utah. So far all those with confirmed cases are children. Hospitalized: 9-year-old patient  Jayden Broadway of Denver  sits up in his hospital bed coughing as he is being treated at the hospital on Monday, September 8 for enterovirus 68 . 1.Avoid sharing objects such as utensils, cups, and bottles. 2.Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and wash your hands afterwards. If tissue-less, cough or sneeze into your elbow or upper arm, not into your hands. 3.Keep your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth to keep germs from entering your body. 4.Proper and consistent hand washing is one of the easiest ways to prevent the spread of flu. Teach kids by example by showing them proper hand washing technique: . Wet hands with water and apply an amount of soap recommended by the manufacturer to hands. Rub hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds, covering all surfaces of the hands and giving added attention to fingernails and surfaces where jewelry is worn. Rinse hands with water. Dry thoroughly with a disposable towel. Use towel to turn off faucet. The virus can cause mild to severe illness, with the worst cases needing life support for breathing difficulties. Kids with asthma have been especially vulnerable. No deaths have been reported thus far. The strain is not new but only a small number of labs can test for it. Since mid-August, there's been an unusual spike in identified cases. The CDC has tested more than 200 specimens from more than 30 states. Investigators say it's not yet clear what triggered the outbreak or whether it's worsening. The Washington Post reports that enteroviruses are very common and cause between 10 million and 15 million infections every year. The particular strain enterovirus 68 hasn't appeared very often since it was first isolated in California in 1962. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters that most enterovirus infections in the United States occur in the summertime and in the fall. She expects that the number of viruses to drop later in the year. In order to prevent transmission of the virus children should practice proper hand-washing and should cover their mouths and nose when coughing or sneezing. Another way of preventing disease is by strengthening the immune system by eating a balanced diet, drinking lots of fluids, exercising daily, managing stress, and getting enough sleep, according to The Red Cross via WIBV.com.","As of Wednesday both Minnesota and New Jersey have confirmed cases of the severe virus enterovirus 68 .

"Turkey has been ordered to pay Cyprus a record £75million for its 1974 invasion and the island's subsequent division. The European Court of Human Rights said the passage of time did not erase Turkey's responsibility in the case, ruling that the country must pay £24million to relatives of those missing in the operations. It also ordered Turkey to pay £50million for 'the enclaved Greek-Cypriot residents of the Karpas peninsula' - the northernmost tip of the Turkish Cypriot part of the island where hundreds of Greek Cypriots still live.

Cyprus has been divided since Turkey invaded after a coup by supporters of union with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state that was proclaimed in the north of the island. The European Court of Human Rights' judgement - which is the largest is has ever made - comes as the Turkish and Greek communities in Cyprus make new efforts to reunite the island. The court said it would be up to the government of Cyprus to determine how to award the damages.

It was the first case in which a Greek Cypriot successfully sued Turkey over the invasion and earned the right to compensation. Turkey eventually paid the money in 2003, but is still yet to comply with an earlier European Court decision ordering the country to allow Loizidou to reclaim her property.","European Court of Human Rights orders Turkey to compensate Cyprus .

"The culprit who sparked a murder scare after leaving 'a trail of blood' along a jetty that was visible on Google Maps was today revealed to be a wet dog called Rama. The 'blood' seen in the image was in fact a trail of water left by the dog after it went for a swim. Rama's hounding down has ended days of guesswork as to whether a crime scene had been captured by aerial photos. The mystery aerial shot: This image showing what appeared to be a grisly crime scene in a park in the city of Almere, Netherlands, sparked days of speculation as to what it could really be . The satellite shot from Google maps had sparked online speculation that a vicious crime may have taken place and gone undetected in the Dutch city of Almere. First posted on Reddit, it shows what looks like a trail of blood apparently leading on to a waterside jetty jutting into a lake in Beatrixpark, in the heart of the city. At the end of the trail it appears as though two people are standing over a dead body, preparing to throw it into the water. But investigations carried out by fans of the popular social news site revealed that the 'crime scene' was in fact nothing of the sort. Eagle-eyed internet sleuths used a little-known technique to zoom right into the image to reveal that it was in fact a soggy dog which had left what looked like the bloody trail. And now the dog's owner has come forward to tell of her surprise when she realised the picture, which went viral online, in fact showed her and a friend out playing catch with her dog, Rama. 'When I saw the picture I realised, ""it's my dog"". He loves the water,' she told The Sun. 'He jumps off the end of the jetty, swims around to the bridge and runs down to the edge again. 'It's hilarious that everyone thought it was murder. But it's great he's now world famous.' Detailed analysis: Once one Reddit user revealed how fellow laptop sleuths could zoom in more closely to the image posted by ncav, they began annotating the image to attempt to prove the wet dog theory . Even more detailed analysis: Another Reddit user posted this image which attempted to explain what was going on in the ambiguous-looking scene in even greater detail . The city of Almere where the bizarre Google Maps image was captured is Holland's newest city and . home to more than 193,000 people. The first homes were only completed in 1976. The . image was originally posted on April 12 by a Reddit user named ncav, . with the caption: 'A murder near my house on Google Maps, link in . comments.' Inside the comments attached to the post, the user added that he and his friend had told the police about the apparent crime. Further commenters then sought to debunk the murder hypothesis. The investigation really took off when Redditor xythrowawayy shared a little-known trick which allowed fellow users to zoom in further than anyone had previously managed. It . involved grabbing the URL usually used to share the map via email or . social media and changing the number at the very end of the link from 22 . to 23. 'If Google Maps has imagery at that higher zoom level, it will show it to you,' added xythrowawayy.

But it was Bennyboy1337 who was the first to work out that what the image shows is in fact a dog which has left a wet trail along the jetty's wooden deck, and not a body surrounded by blood. 'Looks like a dog got out of the water and shook itself dry, then walked off the dock while dripping water, the wet wood looks much darker in colour,' wrote Bennyboy1337. 'You can clearly see where the dog shook, walked off the deck, then walked back to his owner on a separate lighter coloured path on the bottom.' Two users on the site then annotated the zoomed-in image to point out more details that appeared to confirm the wet-dog theory. A third then zoomed out a little to point out that there were other people walking right past the supposed bloody crime scene, while another used Google Maps distance measuring tool to estimate that the 'body' is just 3.5ft long.

"A couple who were tied to a large mortgage decided to downsize their home by creating their own tiny house on wheels costing just $33,000 (£19,600). Andrew and Gabriella Morrison from Oregon were tired by the fact their lives revolved around monthly payments to the bank. So they decided to opt out of the rat race. The pair both have backgrounds in construction and wanted a place that would feel like a real home, but more importantly be mortgage free. And that's when they came up with the idea of hOMe, a tiny house on wheels, but which looks like a stylish abode both on the outside and in, and comes complete with high end appliances and furniture. Mrs Morrison, 43, explained: 'It took us four months to build and cost $22,000 (£13,000), $33,000 (£19,600) if we include the high end appliances, cabinetry, furniture, and fixtures. 'We are now debt free, off grid, joyful, closer as a family, and enjoying living our lives full time in hOMe.'

The couple also have a 17-year-old son called Paiute who attends college. As well as having no mortgage payments, their heating and cooling bills are significantly lower, due to the massive reduction in square footage to their home.

"Secret policy: Banking giant HSBC has admitted a series of withdrawals were stopped or reduced when customers failed to provide evidence of what it was for . Bank customers who try to withdraw large sums of cash over the counter face a grilling and may be asked to provide written confirmation of why they need the funds. Under pressure to crack down on fraud, branch staff are increasingly demanding customers supply evidence of what they plan to spend their own money on. HSBC last year introduced new rules which allow staff to block a demand for cash unless you can prove what it’s for. This could include booking receipts, an invoice, a quote for work or even a letter. Lenders including Santander, Barclays and the Nationwide Building Society also now reserve the right for counter staff to request such proof if they fear the withdrawal could be linked to fraud. Banks lose £475million to fraud each year, according to figures from the Financial Fraud Action UK trade body. In particular, a rise in scams such as ‘vishing’ has put many banks on high alert. Vishing – where crooks hijack a customer’s phone line and convince them to hand over their account details – can include persuading victims to withdraw large sums of cash over the counter. Banks say they need to strike a balance between allowing customers easy access to  their money whenever they want it, and fighting fraudsters. If staff notice a rise in such frauds in their local area, they are more likely to introduce tough restrictions. However, innocent customers have had genuine demands for cash repeatedly rejected. Earlier this month an HSBC customer who wanted to repay a family loan was told he couldn’t take £7,000 from his instant access savings account. Policy: The bank has admitted it changed its policy in November and told on account holder they did not have to notify him . Counter . staff informed Stephen Cotton, from Worcestershire – a loyal customer . for nearly 30 years who was well-known at the branch – he had to produce . a letter as proof. He told . the BBC’s Money Box: ‘When we presented them with the withdrawal slip, . they declined to give us the money because we could not provide them . with a satisfactory explanation for what the money was for. They wanted a . letter from the person involved.’ A year earlier Mr Cotton had . withdrawn a similar cash sum without any difficulties. On Thursday 16th January, This is Money – the Mail Online money section - revealed how one customer was blocked from withdrawing more than £1,000 over the counter in HSBC Swindon. This was despite the fact he was more than £50,000 in credit. HSBC confirmed that it may ask about the purpose of a cash withdrawal when the transaction is large, unusual and out of keeping with the normal running of a customer’s account. You can read the full story here: HSBC won't give me more than £1k over the counter even after I warned them I needed it – can they block me from my own cash? A . spokesman for HSBC, which in 2012 paid £1.25billion to settle . money-laundering allegations in the US, said: ‘Since November, in some . instances, we may have asked customers to show us evidence of what the . cash is required for. ‘As a . responsible bank we must track all financial transactions. Cash presents . more risk, and in particular financial crime risk, than other payment . methods. ‘This is why we ask . our customers about the purpose of large cash withdrawals when they are . unusual and out of keeping with the normal running of their account. ‘However, it is not mandatory for them to provide documentary evidence for large cash withdrawals.’ All High Street banks usually ask customers to provide 24 hours notice for a large cash withdrawal of at least £5,000. Barclays . doesn’t have a  policy of asking for proof  but says experienced branch . staff are able to ask for  evidence if they have their own suspicions. Eric . Leenders, executive director at the British Bankers’ Association, said: . ‘There is a clear tension between, on the one hand, providing customers . easy access to their money and, on the other hand, protecting customers . from the threat of a fraud that could have a devastating effect on . someone’s finances.’","Bank brought in secret policy last November, which has led to complaints .
Customers say withdrawals were refused or they were forced to barter .
HSBC says policy is 'responsible' and allows them to tackle financial crime ."

"A teenager who was 23st at the age of 15 has lost half his body weight - and become a weight loss coach. Nathan Hewitt was one of Britain’s most obese schoolchildren after bingeing on fast food and sitting around playing video games. But after being ridiculed on a rollercoaster ride at Alton Towers, he was shamed into losing 12st. Nathan Hewitt, 23, weighed 23st by the time he was 15 as he binged on junk food and didn't exercise . Mr Hewitt was shamed into losing weight when he couldn't fit on a rollercoaster. He went on a strict diet and lost 12st. He now weighs a healthy 11st . And he has gone from being the fat boy who everyone bullied to the slim guy who the girls all want to date. Mr Hewitt, now 23, from Merthyr Tydfil, in South Wales, has set himself up as a weight loss coach targeting Britain’s growing numbers of fat children. The Welsh Government has given him financial support to get his business up and running with a Young Entrepreneur’s Business Grant. And some of his first clients are the classroom bullies who made his life hell when he was the fattest boy in school. Mr Hewitt said: ‘I’ve been there, I know how it feels to be massive - you only have to look at my old photographs to see I was huge. ‘But I can use my experience to encourage other overweight children to slim down and change to healthy lifestyles.’ Mr Hewitt was bullied at school because of his weight and then turned to food for comfort . Mr Hewitt lost weight by going on a strict healthy eating regime and by taking up exercising . Mr Hewitt’s turning point came during a family trip to Alton Towers where he couldn’t wait to go on their latest ride. But the attendants couldn’t pull the safety bar over him and he had to walk off while people in the queue sniggered and poked fun. He said: ‘I knew at that moment I had to change my life for good - my weight was making me miserable. ‘I’d put up with years of bullying in school and I took comfort in the only thing I knew and that was food. It was a vicious circle.’ Mr Hewitt was one of the most obese children in Britain. He is pictured before he started to lose weight . Mr Hewitt has now received a Government grant to help him set himself up as a weight loss coach . When he was 19 Mr Hewitt had surgery to remove his excess folds of skin. He is pictured after the operation . But after going on a healthy diet and exercising Mr Hewitt more than halved his body weight to get to 11st. He underwent surgery at 19 to get rid of the excess folds of skin he was left with - but since then he has not looked back. He said: ‘A lot of obese children don’t think they can make the changes they need to lose weight - but I’m there to show them they can. Mr Hewitt said: 'I know how it feels to be massive - you only have to look at my old photographs to see I was huge. But I can use my experience to encourage other overweight children to slim down' Mr Hewitt said: 'A lot of obese children don't think they can make the changes they need to lose weight - but I'm there to show them they can' ‘It’s hard but it is do-able and I’m the example of that. ‘My life has changed in so many ways - I’m more confident, healthier, fitter. I really feel like a different person to when I was 15 and over 300lbs.’ Mr Hewitt is launching the first of his weight loss seminars ‘Try This For Size: The Weight Loss Breakthrough Programme’ in Merthyr Tydfil which has a problem with child obesity. He was given a £6,000 grant and the services of a mentor to help him set up as a weight loss coach.","Nathan Hewitt, 23, weighed 23st by the time he was 15 years old .

"If you substituted the animals for humans, it’s the sort of scene you might see on a Friday night in Newcastle or Cardiff. These comical pictures were taken after a herd of young elephants ate a fruit which is said to make large mammals drunk when eaten in huge quantities. Marula fruit - said to be sweet, tart and refreshing - apparently has an intoxicating effect when consumed after it has ripened and fallen to the ground. Ross Couper, a field guide who works for luxury safari outfit Singita in South Africa's Kruger National Park, saw the elephants begin to stumble around and fall over their siblings. He said: ‘We watched in awe because the youngsters definitely seemed to display signs of being rather tipsy.’ However, it has also been claimed that the unusual behaviour is actually caused by eating beetle pupae that live in the bark of marula trees.

"A tanker loaded with $100 million of crude oil that has been at the center of a dispute over Iraq's oil billions vanished off the coast of Texas on Thursday. The Kurdish tanker disappeared from Coast Guard radar screens following a month of legal wrangling over whether it can offload its cargo in the U.S. As the disintegration of Iraq amid mounting violence continues, the semi-autonomous regime in Kurdistan – in the north of Iraq – is trying to cash in on Iraq's oil reserves and export its own crude. Oil tanker United Kalavyrta (also known as the United Kalavrvta), which is carrying a cargo of Kurdish crude oil, approaching Galveston, Texas on July 25. The boat has since disappeared from Coast Guard radar . A still image from video taken by a U.S. Coast Guard HC-144 Ocean Sentry aircraft shows the oil tanker United Kalavyrta sitting in the Gulf of Mexico . Iraqi Kurdistan has exported at least eight million barrels of oil since May, energy experts told Al Arabiya News. But the increasingly weak regime in Baghdad is trying to keep control of its oil billions and says the Kurdish regime cannot sell the oil in the U.S. The U.S. Coast Guard's AIS ship-tracking system showed no position for the United Kalavrvta on Thursday, which was carrying one million barrels - and was 95 per cent - when it went dark. The tanker was attempting to unload its cargo at sea, off the coast of Texas, after leaving the Turkish port of Ceyhan in June and anchoring near the U.S. port of Galveston in late July. The U.S. Coastguard confirmed to MailOnline today that the last contact the agency had with the United Kalavyrta was when the ship's certificate of compliance was completed on July 27. The vessel's disappearance is now thought to be the latest development in a high-stakes dispute between Baghdad and the Kurds over the right to export oil. Several other tankers transporting disputed oil from Iran or Kurdistan have switched off their transponders before unloading their cargo - making their movements extremely difficult to track. A Coast Guard official told MailOnline today that the vessel might have turned off its beacon in the Gulf of Mexico, which it is not supposed to do. The official also said it was possible the ship had traveled outside the range of the U.S. Coastguard antennas which would account for it vanishing from the AIS ship-tracking system. Legal dispute: The vessel's disappearance is thought to be the latest development in a high stakes argument between Baghdad and the Kurds over the right to export oil . Earlier this year, cutbacks in spending at the U.S. Coastguard have meant that longer-range antennas in the Gulf of Mexico have been gradually shutting down, the official said, making it harder to track ships that move further away from the shore. U.S. Coastguard also told MailOnline on Friday that it had no plans to search areas of the Gulf where the ship had been anchored. The tanker Kamari, which had been carrying a partial load of crude oil from Iraqi Kurdistan turned off its satellite transponder on August 17, north of Egypt's Sinai. It reappeared unladen on August 19 about 30 kilometers off the coast of Israel, ship tracking data on Reuters showed last week. It was not possible to determine where the oil had been delivered to or who the buyer was. A spokesman for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) Ministry of Natural Resources would not comment on the tanker's temporary disappearance at the time. Reuters reported on July 31 that tanker United Emblem, which was carrying more than 1 million barrels of Kurdish oil, had been offloaded into another tanker in the South China Sea. A senior executive at Marine Management Services confirmed in July that the ship-to-ship transfer involving the United Emblem took place in a 'legitimate operation'. The ship is 'fixed to a legitimate charterer and performing legitimate operations,' said Kostas Georgopoulos, the chartering manager at Marine Management Services . 'The ship is still in international waters,' he added. The agency has a HC-144 Ocean Sentry aircraft at its disposal which last took images of the  oil tanker United Kalavyrta on July 25. Only a few days ago, the partially-full Kamari tanker carrying Kurdish crude oil, disappeared from satellite tracking north of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. Two days later, the empty vessel reappeared near Israel. In late July, the tanker United Emblem offloaded part of its cargo of Kurdish crude oil onto another ship in the South China Sea. The evasive behavior is the result of Baghdad wanting to block the Kurds from exporting the oil as they believe they have the exclusive right to do so. The Iraqi government in Baghdad has filed a lawsuit in a U.S. court to reclaim control of the United Kalavrvta cargo and block the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) from delivering its cargo. The suit demonstrates that Baghdad is now stepping up their legal and diplomatic push to block Kurdistan's oil deals, which they view as smuggling. However, the Kurds see such deals as crucial to their own dreams of independence. On Monday, the U.S. court threw out the order  saying it lacked jurisdiction to seize the tanker as it disappeared some 60 miles off their coast. But the judge invited Iraq to re-plead its case over the cargo's rightful ownership. The issue is expected to fuel tensions between Washington and Baghdad, as in theory, Iraq can file claims against anyone taking delivery of the oil. A Coast Guard official said the vessel in the Gulf of Mexico might have turned off its beacon, sailed beyond antennas that monitor transponders, or perhaps some antennas might have been taken out of service. However, dozens of vessels were visible on Thursday in the Galveston Offshore Lightering Area, where the Kurdish tanker was last seen.

"Two in five young women in London have experienced sexual harassment in public spaces in the last year. Forty-one per cent of women aged 18 to 34 said they had encountered unwanted contact or attention in the capital, such as wolf-whistling, sexual comments, staring or exposure, according to a YouGov poll. Campaigners have called for more research into the problem, which they say leaves women across the country feeling threatened and uncomfortable. Intimidating: Two in five young women said they had experienced attention such as wolf-whistling and sexual comments . The research compiled by the End Violence Against Women Coalition found that 21 per cent of women of all ages had experienced unwanted sexual attention and 4 per cent of all women had been subjected to unwanted sexual touching. The survey also asked female Londoners about their experiences while on public transport, and found 31 per cent of women aged 18 to 24 received unwanted sexual attention. Fourteen per cent of women of all ages said they encountered unwanted sexual attention, while one in 20 experienced unwanted sexual touching. Some claimed they had been harassed while onlookers did nothing to help them. One victim, music photographer Rosie Wadey, 20, said she had been sexually assaulted three times since moving to London. She said each incident had begun with her being harassed in the street. Describing the most recent assault, which happened in Liverpool Street station, she said that a man had approached her at about 11.30pm as she used a cash point. 'He followed me and would not stop talking to me,' she told the Independent. 'By that point, I had made it perfectly clear that I did not want to talk to him. 'He put his arm around me. He asked me things like, ""Do you have a boyfriend?"", ""Want to come back to my house?"". I got more and more aggressive, and this person is not taking the message. 'It got to the point where he put his hand on my head and pulled me by my hair, and I screamed at him.' Sarah Green, 36, said being harassed was a 'common experience' for her, particularly while cycling in the capital. 'It can be quite seasonal,' she said. 'It's worse when the weather is better. 'It's a minority of people who behave in this way, but they probably do it again and again. Victims: Rosie Wadey, left, and Vicky Simister, right, have both been subjected to sexual harassment in public . 'You'll have someone in the passenger seat, waiting at the lights, just calling out offensive stuff.' Ms Green described an occasion when she was followed by two men in a white van while cycling in Bermondsey. 'They said something to me that was quite rude and that day I had had enough,' she said. Women told the YouGov survey that they felt threatened by men approaching them and giving them unwanted sexual attention. Here are some of the comments from respondents: . 'I feel safer on public transport than I do walking around, but I have still experienced several nasty incidents of sexual harassment on the tube where I have been forced to change carriage or leave the train a stop early to avoid harassment from men.' 'Feel unsafe at night if I am alone and travelling home. I often move carriages on the tube to feel safer or change buses.' 'Have had some issues when travelling on the top deck of a bus, especially at night, so don't feel safe up there. Safer to sit nearer the driver.' 'Some people will say it's trivial or even a bit flattering, but women will tell you it's not because, if you tell them to stop it, the situation can escalate quite quickly. 'We were on a main road and, after I turned on to a minor road, they followed me for three streets at speed. 'I had to pick up my speed and race away. They were shouting all sorts of offensive things at me - four-letter words - and it was really threatening.' Ms Green said motorists would shout negative comments about her appearance, as well as positive, and that experience could also be intimidating. 'Sometimes it's men telling you that you're fat or that you're ugly and that you need to sort yourself out,' she said. 'Now I pity these men, but when I was younger I felt threatened and it determined how I felt about myself.' The coalition commissioned the survey to highlight the everyday impact of sexual harassment and how it makes women feel unsafe. It said 45,000 incidents of domestic violence and 3,000 rapes were reported to police in London last year. Another victim of sexual harassment, Vicky Simister, 27, decided to found a campaign group, the UK Anti Street Harassment Campaign, after she was attacked by a group of men at Manor House underground station in north London in 2010. She said: 'I was walking along the street when a group of men in a car pulled up alongside me. 'It was dark and they started trying to talk to me and making comments about my appearance. 'They slowed down and followed me as I walked to the Tube station, which took about 15 minutes. 'I was really wound up and frustrated and I told them to leave me alone. Pursued: Cyclist Sarah Green was followed by two men who made lewd comments to her . 'They followed me into the station and pinned me against the wall. I had to be helped by members of the public.' Ms Simister said of the survey results: 'In order to address this, local councils and the police need to convey a strong message that this behaviour will not be tolerated by perpetrators. 'It is important to note that this is not a London-only problem, and a national survey needs to happen to understand the extent of the problem. 'We hope that London can lead the way in addressing this issue - particularly in light of the impending Olympics and international perceptions of our nations attitude to women's safety.' Ms Simister decided to set up her campaign group after she was attacked by a group of men at Manor House underground station in north London. Coalition co-chairman Professor Liz Kelly said: 'Our survey shows that sexual harassment in London is extremely common. 'Some survey respondents also said that this behaviour makes them feel uncomfortable and unsafe and makes them change their behaviour and decisions about when and where to travel. 'Despite this high prevalence and impact however, public sexual harassment is a form of abuse which generally goes unchallenged, creating an unsafe and unequal environment for women. 'We need investment in public campaigns on transport and elsewhere saying this behaviour is unacceptable, and training for transport staff and police about how to respond to it.' Women who responded to the survey described having to change carriage or leave a stop early after experiencing harassment on the train or tube, while others said they avoided sitting on the top decks of buses. Raising awareness: Professor Liz Kelly called for more investment in campaigns on public transport . The coalition said research was lacking into the scale of the problem in the UK, but some international studies appear to show that as many as four in five women have experienced sexual harassment. It has sent its findings to Transport for London and urged the body to begin a campaign making the public aware that sexual harassment can be a crime and is unacceptable. It is also calling for more training for police and transport staff to deal with reports of sexual harassment. Bryony Beynon, co-director of Hollaback London, a campaign aimed at ending street harassment, said: 'These statistics are just the tip of the iceberg. 'From unwanted sleazy comments to violent sexual assault, street harassment is an epidemic in London. 'Our website gets thousands of hits a month from women looking for support, reassurance and a chance to speak out about their often horrifying daily experiences. 'Whether 13 or 70 years old, time and time again they ask ""What did I do to deserve this?"" 'Wider social change through community education as well as more robust enforcement of the laws designed to protect women in public is desperately needed. 'Until then, men who harass need to wake up to the damage this behaviour is having on a daily basis.'","21 per cent of women of all ages have experienced unwanted sexual attention, survey finds .

Andreas Ahlsen, the owner and guide of the Eco-Lodge Andreas Ahlsen. ‘Some creative people in the town wanted to keep the charcoal making tradition alive in the area. ‘They decided to re-create charcoal huts and have this place in the woods for people to enjoy.’ Set in a beautiful forest, guests are required to fetch their own water during their stay at the Kolarbyn Eco-Lodge . Although the hotel does provide basic food resources, guests need to gather their own wood and light fires to cook it and keep warm . Mr Ahlsen said: ‘People visit Kolarbyn lodges because they want to experience the nature and to test sleeping in the historical charcoal huts. ‘They want to come away from the normal day life. ‘The huts themselves are relatively small; as if they are too big it will destroy the nature experience.’ An all-inclusive deal for three nights at the hotel costs 4,390 Swedish krona (around £400). This deal includes meals and two wildlife tours to see animals such as moose and beavers. In addition to wildlife watching, visitors can also make the most of a nearby spring for swimming.

"Anderson Silva broke down in tears after making a successful return to the Octagon with a dominant win over Nick Diaz at UFC 183. It was far from a vintage performance from the 39-year-old but he did at least begin to lay to rest the ghosts of his horror leg break against Chris Weidman more than a year ago. Silva was awarded every round by two of the judges as he consistently beat Diaz to the punch on the Californian's middleweight debut.

'This was important for me and important for my whole family,' Silva said. 'I went through a lot of suffering [after the broken leg] and in the beginning, I didn't think I'd be back.' Silva is renowned for his antics in the Octagon but was uncharacteristically subdued in the opening round as Diaz opted to start the mind games by briefly lying on the canvas and constantly chattering away to his opponent. He threw an early kick but both men were content to circle the other in the opening stages. Silva landed a one-two as Diaz swung and missed with his right leg. After 90 seconds with barely a shot thrown, Silva launched forward with his hands but missed, allowing Diaz to respond with a leg kick before he too switched up top. The former champion finished the round strongly however, landing with two jabs before launching a knee at a backed-up Diaz. The second session also started slowly but Silva showed no sign of nerves as he flicked out his previously injured leg.  Diaz also focused on landing his kicks but took a swift right-left combination to the face. An attempted takedown was thwarted by the Brazilian and he again caught the judges' eyes in the closing seconds. Although not at his best, Silva was landing on Diaz and the Californian's face began to mark up around his left eye in the third stanza which would late require stages. He continued to goad Silva but the Octagon legend refused to be drawn in, instead focusing on landing leg kicks on Diaz. Diaz lay down in the first round, taunting Silva but the former champion refused to engage in the mind games . Diaz continued to taunt Silva, beckoning him to come forward but the Brazilian remained disciplined . Silva had consistent success with his kicking and did not seem troubled by the leg he injured in 2013 . When Diaz had success, it was with his kicking as he attempted to break down Silva on his return . Diaz later claimed he thought he had won every round but punches like this were a rare sight in the fight . Silva embarked on a victory lap of the Octagon after the final bell of his middleweight clash with Diaz . Diaz was badly marked up around his left eye after he was outlanded by Silva over the five rounds . The American did at least start the penultimate round brightly but his successes were few and far between. Silva looked light on his feet as he circled away before landing a right hand. But again there was little to keep the MGM Grand crowd enthused and there were a smattering of discontented voices among the cheers for Silva. When Diaz did come forward, Silva responded, landing a double jab and leg kick to fend off his attacker.

"Photographed using a specialized microscope whose viewing stage is chilled to -170C, scientists in Maryland are showing a whole new side to what's caught on the tip of our tongues. Using a low-temperature scanning electron microscope, researchers at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center have captured an astonishing new view on naturally-occurring snowflakes. Shipping in the samples collected from snow banks or during fresh snow fall from around the country, the researchers study their composition for their effects on our ecosystem. Scroll down for video . Full-frontal: These unique images captured with a low-temperature scanning electronic microscope capture show a side to snowflakes rarely seen before . Colouring: This image, shown with a tint of red, is what is called a psedo-coloured snowflake whose colour is computer generated and used commonly to highlight different parts of the flake . Frosty touch: Magnifying this hexagon flake 450 times its size shows a detailed, frosty surface . Use: The magnifications, while stunning, are used to help scientists better assess the nation's water supply and how to protect from flooding . E.T.: With such unique detail some flakes appear extraterrestrial-like . In comparison to man made or artificial snow - they also show in samples magnified on their website – the naturally occurring snow is dramatically more rigid and varied in structure, with the man made appearing more round and gob-like. More importantly to the scientists than how they look, cosmetically at least, is the data gained from where they were collected that's of value. 'Information gained from studying the structure of snow is vital to several areas of science as well as to activities that affect our daily lives...' the website of the Electron and Confocal Microscopy Laboratory states. The hydrologists explain the flakes' use to determine the winter snow pack's water content to better determine the nation's water supply and how to better protect from flooding. Artificial: A closeup on some artificial snow shows a much smoother contrast from the naturally made snow . Shipped: The snowflakes are shipped to the center in Maryland from natural sources outside the state . Collecting: The snowflakes are either brushed onto copper flakes held by researchers or allowed to fall naturally on them . Preservation: Once the flakes are captured they are right away dipped in liquid nitrogen, cooling them down to -196C . Stuck: The copper plates used to catch the flakes are also coated on one side with methyl cellulose - a gel like solution . Shipping: Once captured on the copper plate, they can be shipped in a previously liquid nitrogen-cooled dewar . Using flat copper plates precooled to the same outside temperature and coated on one side with methyl cellulose - a gel like solution - researchers from outside the state collect the snow samples on this pallet before sending it out. The field researchers report either allowing the snowflakes to fall and settle on the plate's surface or lightly brushing them on themselves. Once collected, the plates are rapidly plunged in liquid nitrogen, cooling them down to -196C. The plates can then be shipped in a previously liquid nitrogen-cooled dewar, providing them with thermal insulation before transported by air or ground. Resemblances: Like a prickly sundial, one flake reveals a hexagon plate with a frosty siding . Extra details: A glass-like snowflake in the upper right-hand corner shows the center flake before pulling in to a view 79 times its size . Depth: Zooming into each flake reveals more and more spiny edges and crevices that appear to go on forever . Magnifications: Shown at the top, a flake is seen magnified 908 times while at the bottom the same area is seen magnified 1,860 times . Variety: Appearing as though brushed with icing, some snowflakes appear more rounded than the others typically seen as thorny . Guessing game: Depending on your interests, a close up on this snowflake could resemble a simple barbell or a TIE fighter from Star Wars . Surfaces: Another snowflake, tinged in blue with the help of a computer, shows smoother, stacked surfaces . Structures: Another snowflake shows what the researchers call columns and plates .

"A terminally ill father managed to fulfil the last of his dying wishes just four days before he died. Ryan Graham, 32, got married, spent Father’s Day with his step-children, and then celebrated his step-daughter’s birthday. The pig farmer from Needham Market, Suffolk, was told in February that he had just months to live after being diagnosed with aggressive stomach cancer. Ryan Graham, 32, was diagnosed with aggressive stomach cancer in February. Before he died, he wanted to marry his partner, Amy, spend Father's Day with his step-children, Shellie, 11, and Ryan, 8, and to attend Shellie's birthday party in August . He refused to let the illness beat his desire to marry his partner, Amy, and to spend Father’s Day with his step-children Shellie, 11, and Ryan, eight. In August, doctors warned him that he wouldn’t make it to Shellie’s birthday and said the party should be brought forward. But incredibly, despite having been bed-bound for four weeks, Mr Graham got to his feet to see Shellie, 11, blow out her candles on August 16. He passed away peacefully four days later. Mrs Graham said: ‘Ryan was amazing - the most wonderful partner and father to my children. ‘When we found out the cancer was terminal it was devastating, but Ryan was determined to die on his own terms. Doctor's told Mr Graham (pictured with his wife, Amy, and step-children Ryan and Shellie on Shellie's birthday) that he would not live until Shellie's birthday but he did and he even managed to get out of bed to celebrate with her. He died just four days later . Mr Graham (pictured on his birthday) proposed to his girlfriend, Amy, a month after he was told his cancer was terminal . ‘He did everything that he wanted, reaching every milestone he set out to, and then peacefully passed away. ‘Getting to Shellie’s birthday was really difficult - the doctors wanted us to bring it forward, and he hadn’t even been out of bed for four weeks - but he managed to come downstairs and watch her blow out the candles. ‘He was very ill, but he always had a smile on his face.’ Mr Graham’s first wish was realised in May when he married Amy. Mrs Graham (pictured with Ryan and her children on her wedding day) said: 'It was the most amazing day. There wasn't a dry eye in the house, it couldn't have been more perfect' She said: ‘Ryan and I met in March 2012 through a mutual friend and instantly hit it off. ‘He was a wonderful partner and he formed a bond with my children that I never expected. ‘He’d always wanted to be a dad and I loved that he was so close to the kids. When he was diagnosed with the cancer he told me he’d leave if that’s what I wanted. ‘He didn’t want me to be a widow, but he was the one for me. It never even crossed my mind to leave him. Mrs Graham said: 'Ryan (pictured at work before his illness) was amazing - the most wonderful partner and father to my children. When we found out the cancer was terminal it was devastating, but Ryan was determined to die on his own terms' ‘He proposed to me just a month after we were told it was terminal. ‘I was just making a cup of tea in the kitchen, and I turned around to see Ryan down on one knee, holding a Haribo ring his hand. ‘It was so simple, but it was perfect.’ The pair planned their white wedding in the space of just six weeks. Before he died, Mr Graham made memory boxes for each of the children as a way of showing them how much they meant to him . Mrs Graham said: ‘It was a bit crazy planning the wedding so quickly. ‘When we found a venue and asked the manager if they had a day available in May or June, he immediately flipped his calendar to 2014. ‘I think he was a bit shocked that we wanted to get married so soon, but luckily there was a date free. After that everything else just fell into place. ‘Just three days before the wedding he’d been admitted to hospital, so it was a bit scary, but I always knew he’d be there. Mrs Graham (pictured with Ryan on Valentine's Day) said: 'He did everything that he wanted, reaching every milestone he set out to, and then peacefully passed away' ‘It was the most amazing day. There wasn’t a dry eye in the house, it couldn’t have been more perfect.’ Mr Graham’s next dream was to spend Father’s Day with his step-children. His wife said: ‘Ryan was a wonderful second dad to the kids. ‘He was known as big Ryan and my son was little Ryan. They did everything together, so we really wanted to make Father’s Day special - it was the only one he’d have with them. Mrs Graham said: 'Ryan was a wonderful second dad to the kids. He was known as big Ryan and my son was little Ryan. They did everything together, so we really wanted to make Father's Day special - it was the only one he'd have with them' ‘The children got him lots of presents, but he wanted to do something special for them too, so he put together some memory boxes for them. ‘He filled them with memories of their favourite holidays and moments together. He just wanted them to know how much they meant to him.’ Mr Graham’s final wish was to celebrate Shellie’s eleventh birthday in August and by that time he was in and out of hospital, and had spent four weeks in bed. Mrs Graham said: ‘The doctors had warned us that we should bring Shellie’s birthday forward, but Ryan was quite determined to make it to the proper day. Mrs Graham said: 'Ryan (pictured with the children on Father's Day) fought this horrible disease until the end. He will forever be remembered as a brave, loving man, and I feel lucky to have known him' ‘Ryan had been bed bound for a while, but when it came to Shellie blowing out her candles at her party, she wanted Ryan to be there. ‘I don’t know how he managed it, but he made his way downstairs, and sung happy birthday with everyone else. ‘I couldn’t believe he found the strength to do it, but it was incredible. ‘When we helped him back upstairs after the party he looked at me and told me he was tired. It’s only now that I realise what he meant.’ Mr Graham is pictured with Shellie and Ryan on Shellie's 11th birthday. Mr Graham died four days later on August 20 . Over the next four days, Mr Graham’s condition worsened. Family and friends came to say their goodbyes and on August 20 he died surrounded by his loved ones. Mrs Graham said: ‘Ryan fought this horrible disease until the end. He will forever be remembered as a brave, loving man, and I feel lucky to have known him. ‘We’ll continue to remember him by raising money for the St Elizabeth Hospice in Ipswich who looked after Ryan so well. ‘Every Father’s Day, birthday, and Christmas, we’ll donate money as a way to remember him. Mr Graham is pictured on Shellie's birthday, just days before he died . ‘Life is very different now, it’s been tough without Ryan, but he will never be forgotten.’ A spokesman for St Elizabeth Hospice said: ‘St Elizabeth Hospice cared for Ryan at his home and at our hospice in Ipswich. We were also able to provide support for his family. ‘We are pleased we were able to help Ryan, Amy and their family during these tough times. ‘We are extremely grateful for the support his family and friends have shown by raising money in his name for his St Elizabeth Tribute Fund.’ Donations can be made to St Elizabeth Hospice at http://tribute.stelizabethhospice.org.uk/ryan-graham/ . Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, occurs when a tumour develops inside the stomach. The initial symptoms are vague so are often mistaken for other conditions. They include indigestion, stomach ache, nausea and feeling very full after meals. Symptoms of advanced stomach cancer include blood in the stools, loss of appetite and weight loss. Stomach cancer is most common in people who are over 60, male, white and eat an unhealthy diet low in fruit and vegetables. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove some or all of the stomach and chemotherapy. The cancer is relatively uncommon and about 6,000 people are diagnosed in the UK each year.

"Shadow Minister for Sport Clive Efford was first to berate the Premier League for not spending enough on grassroots football after the jackpot £5billion TV rights deal was announced. Efford said: ‘These are incredible sums of money and it would be nothing short of criminal if none of the extra money goes to expand participation at the grassroots of football.’ Yet it did not escape Premier League notice that on Wednesday — the day after the TV bonanza was secured — Efford was at the opening of a new £400,000 3G football facility in his Eltham constituency funded by the Premier League and FA. Clive Efford criticised the Premier League for not spending more of its TV rights riches on grassroots football . Sky Sports, whose pundits include Graeme Souness (left) and Thierry Henry, secured five of seven Premier League packages in the new deal from 2016-17 at a cost of more than £11m per match . It also emerged that the Premier League had wanted their name added to Efford’s quotes in the Press release acknowledging the work of the Football Foundation in delivering the project. But Efford declined the request, saying his words were fine as they stood. The MP said the Premier League should ‘live up to their promise’ that five per cent of their domestic TV income goes towards growing the game. The Premier League’s answer is that, along with their solidarity payments, they already contribute more. But Efford insists: ‘If that was the case there would be a lot more pitches and coaches at community level.’ The England Cricket Board will allow struggling one-day captain Eoin Morgan to play in the entire Indian Premier League, for which the auction takes place next Monday. Morgan, who has failed to score runs in the World Cup build-up, is fortunate to have the go-ahead from both county Middlesex and England, with whom he has an incremental contract, to play all the IPL when the issue has caused big problems in the past — particularly for Kevin Pietersen. The domestic Twenty20 starts in May, before the end of the IPL, but the ECB have relaxed their approach because it will be good experience for players ahead of the 2016 World Twenty20 in India.

Chelsea, who need to find a new shirt sponsor now a mooted deal with Turkish Airlines has stalled, have brought in former Liverpool chief executive Christian Purslow to head their revamped commercial operation. Purslow in turn has hired outside agency HTH Associates to help him in the hunt. HTH was formed by two ex-Manchester United commercial executives, Leo Thompson and Harry Horsley. However, using Old Trafford sponsorship expertise does not automatically work — as the FA have found with former United global sponsorship manager Phil Barker failing to find a backer for the FA Cup this season.

"CLICK HERE to read why Stuart Lancaster is running out of time to find his best team . I hugely admire rugby league as a sport and the players who take the field. At its best the balance between athletic prowess, skill-set and sheer bloody toughness makes league one of the great sports. I cannot wait to see Sam Burgess play for Bath, I’m sure he has everything to succeed in union and all England rugby fans should be grateful to Bath for bringing him into the sport. That said, we need to be realistic — for Burgess’s sake as much as anything. To suggest Burgess is the answer to England’s poor showing in the backline so far this autumn would be dangerous — he hasn’t played a game of union yet! Sam needs to get on with his game, a challenge he’ll throw himself into. Sam Burgess is expected to make his debut for Bath on Saturday . Burgess speaks with Bath and possible future England team-mate George Ford (left) during training . Burgess poses with a young baby after attracting crowds to a Bath training session . But equally the England setup and their fans can’t sit back and think ‘it’s ok, we’ll have Sam Burgess in a couple of months.’ The focus should remain on our current options until he is ready. Making the transition to union and performing at Test match level is going to take time. If you put him on the field at Twickenham on Saturday he’d get horribly exposed. I’d love to see him in the World Cup squad but the time-frame is very tight. The biggest challenge for Burgess will be understanding the technicalities and subtleties of playing at inside centre in both attack and defence. As has become apparent this autumn, the No 12 holds the keys to the backline. He is not a Jason Robinson or Israel Folau, who can devastate teams with raw speed and athleticism. Those types of players have tended to be more successful at crossing over codes. Burgess’s game is based more on explosive power and smashing through tackles. At the highest level of rugby union that simply won’t be enough. He needs to learn a kicking game, gain an understanding of the patterns run in union and work on his distribution. The biggest challenge for him will be at the breakdown. Unlike in league, it is after the hit that so much happens. I suspect he won’t enjoy hitting rucks but in many ways you don’t want him smashing into rucks because that wouldn’t be the best use of his many qualities. Burgess faces a tough challenge after crossing over from rugby league to union . The 25-year-old is congratulated by Sydney Rabbitohs' owner Russell Crowe after winning the Grand Final . Burgess has starred for England at the 2013 Rugby League World Cup . We know how hard he can tackle but how quickly can he get over the ball and how effectively he can hold up his man in a choke tackle? He has the ability to be world class in this area and the speed at which he learns these skills will be crucial in determining how quickly he progresses into a white England shirt. It is asking a lot for him to be ready in time for the World Cup. The more I think about it, I think he will end up playing in the back row. If that happens he will not be such a significant addition to England’s squad. There is already great depth in the back row. It is in the midfield that they need new ideas. It’s a quandary. One thing Burgess will undoubtedly bring is sheer outright toughness. I was offered a contract to sign for Warrington in 1980 but turned it down because I didn’t think I was tough enough to cut in it in Rugby League. A couple of years later I played union for Manly in Sydney, where the two codes are pretty close. I watched a lot of league and it left me with a massive respect for the sport. The preparation and detail those players put into every training session and every match was light-years ahead of union at that time. Burgess speaks to Bath head coach Mike Ford (left) ahead of his expected Aviva Premiership debut . England coach Stuart Lancaster (centre) is still deliberating over his best central line-up . Billy Twelvetrees will replace Owen Farrell at No 12 for England's final Autumn Test against Australia . Even today the speed and quality of pass and the ability to simply but so effectively time their running lines from deep always stands out to me. They are still ahead of union. I would still get Burgess into the England camp at the earliest opportunity even if his first start comes later. He will raise the standards and will prompt a far greater response than 10 visits from Michael Johnson and Gary Neville. I’m not saying Burgess cannot make it as a union player. I am sure he will. But I would urge caution about the time-frame. Kyle Eastmond said recently it took him the best part of a year to really feel like a union player. Burgess does not have that time on his side. When I became England head coach I’d followed league all my life and knew exactly the type of player Jason Robinson was when I brought him across. Like Folau, Robinson was a sensational athlete whose quick feet set him apart. But I never considered playing him in a key decision-making position such as 12, one of the most challenging positions. Jason Robinson made a successful crossover from league to union under Sir Clive Woodward . All eyes will be on Burgess if he makes his rugby union debut against Harlequins on Saturday . It’s exciting for rugby as a whole that Burgess could be starting for Bath against Harlequins. He’s in the perfect place at Bath, where Mike Ford — a former rugby league player himself — is head coach. I really do envy the opportunity to coach him. The way you look after someone like Burgess is by not trying to change them. Educate them, but allow them to interpret the game themselves. If you do that, you might end up with a unique union player. I’m excited about Burgess and England rugby fans should be, too. But the clock is ticking ahead of the World Cup.","Sam Burgess has crossed codes from rugby league to rugby union .

"Chelsea were denied a certain penalty when Matt Targett tripped Cesc Fabregas as the Chelsea man knocked the ball past the Southampton defender. It was as clear a penalty as you could want to see but referee Anthony Taylor not only denied the league leaders, but he also cautioned the Spaniard for diving.

Select group referees meet up regularly and discuss issues and trends to prepare as best they can for their next assignments. Preparation is perfectly acceptable but prejudgment is not. Chelsea remain top and by definition are still the best team in the league so far; they deserve better from the officials but also need to acknowledge that they have contributed to this problem themselves.

"A man spent over $32,000 to turn the bedroom of his New York City apartment into a 1980s-style arcade - but ended up alone when he and his fed-up fiancee called it quits. Avid game lover Chris Kooluris, 37, works for a PR firm and decided to change the bedroom of his Murray Hill-area apartment after reading a book called Ready Player One, he told Wired.

Kooluris was engaged to a woman and moved into her Brooklyn apartment - but received no offers when it went on the market, Wired reported. He decided to hang on to his own place and redecorate it - and it quickly grew into an obsession. 'There’s a fine line between a hobby and an obsession, and I think what happened is I just got so consumed by it all,' Kooluris told Wired. 'There probably should be therapists for hobbyists. It can take over.'

Justin Purvis, 38, and Tod Purvis, 43, suffer from Choroideremia, an inherited disorder which causes progressive loss of vision. Medics have warned the pair that the disease is likely to cause them to completely lose their sight. Scroll down for video . Tod (left) and Justin (right) in front of Devil's tower in Wyoming.

Tod still has half of his vision remaining, while Justin, who lives in New Jersey, has only 15 per cent of his sight left. Tod, of Los Angeles, said: 'When my vision first started to go in 2008, I got really down and depressed. 'I used to go to work and then come straight home and sit in my apartment - now I want to get out into the world and see things while I still can. 'Going on the trip with Justin brought me out of my apartment, seeing new things every day - it gave me a more positive attitude.' Tod tasting a piece of corn on a farm.

The disease affects their peripheral vision, night vision and depth and color perception. Tod, who works as a television editor, said: 'It's like looking down a long tunnel and you can see the light at the end, but the tunnel is coated in mirrors - it's like viewing the world through a static kaleidoscope. 'There are parts missing in your vision, so your brain tries to fill in the edges with the colors you can see.' The pair filmed their incredible journey across the USA in 2010.

It is such a surreal sight - we had never seen it before so we hung out there for a couple of hours just staring at it and taking it in.'

"This loo with a view has been voted the most extreme place to do you ablutions in the world. The toilet serves a remote weather station at Kara-Tyurek in the Altai Mountains and is is perched on a cliff 2,600 metres above sea level. Plucky staff who work at the station are visited once a month by a postman who collects weather data, and a helicopter which delivers food, water and wood for the stove each autumn. As if suspended off the cliff, this Siberian mountain-top toilet has been named the most extreme loo in the world in a new list . But they have to be very daring indeed to use the terrifying toilet and will surely try very hard to go as little as possible when manning the remote station. People have been using the precarious potty since 1939, in the region with a name which translates as Black Heart in South Altayan language. A recent survey of unusual toilets around the world found the Altai privvy to be the number one most extreme toilet. The terrifying toilet serves a remote weather station in the Siberian Altai Mountains . Those using the perilous privvy can enjoy spectacular views as they do their business . But in the fog the toilet looks sinister and foreboding as it looms on the landscape . Other toilets with star quality were also named in different categories in the survey. The most expensive loo was named as the Swiss Horn Gold Palace in Hong Kong which is made from three tons of gold and took several years to assemble. Scariest toilet in the world was found sitting on top of an open lift shaft on the 15th floor of a building in Guadaljara. Mexico. A single layer of glass is in place, which constructors say will protect anyone using the toilet from falling. During the winter the toilet's users do their ablutions above the clouds on the edge of a snow-capped mountain . A spokesman for Interfax News Agency, which conducted the survey said of the Altai toilet: 'The toilet is perhaps the most unromantic place possible, but there are some parts of the world where people have made them something really special. 'This Siberian commode was listed as the 'most extreme' in the world where the fear evaporates only after years using it.'

"Manchester City face Roma at the Stadio Olimpico in a match which could end their dream of winning their first Champions League trophy. Manuel Pellegrini's side have to better CSKA Moscow's result against Bayern Munich if they are to make it through to the last-16. Here Jamie Redknapp analyses how Manchester City can claim all three points against their Italian opponents. GET READY FOR THE MIDFIELD GENERAL . Daniele De Rossi is an old-fashioned fighter of a midfielder. He plays with great aggression and I love the way he has stuck with Roma. There must be something about the club that makes players want to stay. Like his captain Francesco Totti, 31-year-old De Rossi is a one-club man and the fans love him for it. Before him I liked watching Giuseppe Giannini, who spent 15 years at Roma, and I almost went there myself when Giannini left. De Rossi loves snapping into tackles and he’s good in possession. He is one of the finest defensive midfielders in Europe but City must be careful not to show him too much respect. If they do then he is capable of the kind of dominant display that will whip the crowd into a frenzy. Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi is idolised at the Italian giants due to his commitment to the club . Italian international De Rossi has turned down several moves to leave Roma throughout his career . ATTACKING OPTIONS COULD BE RISKY . Sergio Aguero has carried City at times this season but with him injured, Manuel Pellegrini faces a selection headache. Does he stick to his principles and play two up front or does he put an extra man in midfield? Pellegrini tends to be quite stubborn in the way he plays and though Edin Dzeko can lead the line alone, he doesn’t offer enough defensively. City must win so Pellegrini might be tempted to go with Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic, but being too open is a big risk. Sergio Aguero has been ruled out of Manchester City's Champions League clash against Roma . Manchester City forward Aguero is expected to be out for up to six weeks after sustaining a knee injury . BEWARE THE KING OF ROME . Surely a 38-year-old should not be capable of affecting a game of this magnitude? Think again. Francesco Totti  is a living legend at Roma. The fans worship the ground he walks on and he is playing in his theatre. It might be a cliche to call Totti a gladiator but that’s how the fans see him. He is battle-hardened, and he knows just what it takes to win a game like this. He has never had to rely on speed because his brain is always one step ahead. He scored Roma’s goal in the 1-1 draw at the Etihad and this game could be decided by a single moment of genius. That’s why Totti is such a threat — we know he is more than capable of producing one. Roma captain Francesco Totti will lead his side out against Manchester City on Wednesday night . Totti trains alongside Roma team-mates Miralem Pjanic and De Rossi during a pre-match training session . YANGA-MBIWA COULD LEAVE ROMA IN RUINS . There is no guarantee he will play, but one man I would like to see starting for Roma is Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa. He is a complete liability — he is always likely to pick up a booking and is a mistake waiting to happen. And who did he concede four against on his debut for Newcastle last season? Man City. They could do with a repeat performance from the centre half. Manchester City may look to target Roma centre half Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa during the match in Rome . WHICH GERVINHO WILL TURN UP? The problem with Gervinho is he is so hit and miss. Yes, he’s an improved player since he left Arsenal, where we didn’t see the best of him, but if he lashes one in the top corner one week, the next it will end up in Row Z. But that’s why he’s so dangerous. City have to be aware of him because if he is switched on, he has the potential to cause them big problems. Former Arsenal forward Gervinho will be out to knock Manchester City out of the Champions League .","Manchester City will be without the injured Sergio Aguero for crucial tie .

"I wonder if Rio Ferdinand was true to his word at 10.30 on Saturday night? In the trailer announcing the arrival of the fiftieth anniversary season of Match Of The Day, QPR’s new centre half says that as soon as he hears the show’s iconic theme tune, he drops everything and heads for the telly. Or perhaps this weekend, after his debut for his new team that siren song actually sounded more like the theme from Jaws? And saw Peckham’s finest getting out of earshot, and sharpish! Because prior to the inaugural weekend of the new Premier League season, we had been promised by the BBC that their old dog would show us a few new tricks. And that the pundits would be encouraged to let fly with their opinions. VIDEO Scroll down for Hansen's infamous remark: 'You can't win anything with kids' Copped it: Rio Ferdinand (pictured) was heavily criticised by Alan Shearer on Match of the Day . At fault: Shearer blamed Ferdinand (second right) for failing to mark James Chester (far right) for his goal . So was Saturday night the dawn of a new Shearer? Well, for instance, they certainly took no prisoners when the boys discussed their old pal from the World Cup studio in Brazil. Having lost his man for Hull’s winner at Loftus Road, as well as ending up kneeing a chance to cancel it out, Ferdinand’s fellow pundit in Rio, Alan Shearer, took almost too much pleasure in pointing out where he’d gone wrong. He reminded us that Rio had said out there that he was not a fan of zonal marking, then gleefully added he clearly wasn’t ‘a fan of marking either’. While of his miss, the old No 9 shook his head forlornly and said ‘all the practise we put in on Copacabana beach’. All this though, as you’d expect, with a twinkle in the eye. But those samba days of summer clearly worked as a benchmark for the new approach to this Match Of The Day season. To underline that point, it was Ruud Gullit who was tasked with filling the chair vacated by Alan Hansen. There will be many who feel that simply removing Hansen’s overbearing personality would be enough to give Match of The Day its ‘new look’. But you can’t just have an empty chair. TV pals: Shearer (far left) and Ferdinand (second left) were part of the BBC's World Cup punditry team . Conflicting ideas: Ruud Gullit (left) and Shearer (right) didn't always see eye-to-eye on decisions . Gullit clearly didn’t find it a big seat to fill. He became part of the team in South America, and it showed on Saturday night. First of all, he dovetailed nicely with his Geordie counterpart. And finally, FINALLY, was doing so at least in part because now both pundits shared their opinions on all the games. That abstract system of letting one man talk as the other sat mute is now hopefully a thing of the past. But it wasn’t all a box of chocolates between them. When discussing the Kyle Naughton penalty and subsequent red card at Upton Park, it got a bit tasty. Gullit stood his ground by stating ‘it’s the rules’, but Shearer chipped away stating the ref ‘should show common sense’. They smiled benignly at each other on set, but I bet they carried on that little tete a tete after the lights had dimmed. It was certainly what the DJ’s amongst us might call the right vibe. Seeing red: Gullit and Shearer disagreed over the dismissal of Tottenham's Kyle Naughton (second right) Correct decision? Naughton (centre) was sent off for deliberate handball at West Ham on Saturday . And what of the guv’nor? I’ve often pointed out that Gary Lineker is one of the best sports anchors we’ve got. And the fact he was a top notch pro in his previous career is most certainly the icing on the cake. On Saturday night, though, he reminded us he is none too shabby in the role of journalist, either. Although, granted, Crystal Palace’s co-chairman Steve Parish is a bit of a gaping net as he seems an affable, open man. Nevertheless - in the innovation introduced last season of Gary capturing an interview post match with a figure in the headlines - the host pushed the envelope just a little further than I seem to remember him doing before. One of the best: Gary Lineker is regarded as one of Britain's best sporting presenters . Nice touch: Lineker demonstrated his journalistic skills in his interview with Steve Parish (centre) Questions about Tony Pulis such as ‘perhaps he thought there was a better job out there?’, ‘do you feel let down?’ and then saying ‘worth an ask’ before enquiring who would be his replacement, may seem obvious. But in the more comfortable, perhaps sterile atmosphere of Match Of The Day in, say, its thirties and forties, I don’t think they would have been asked. And luckily for us all, so honestly and interestingly answered. Which in part may just be because people don’t want to let Gary down? They want to tell  him the truth. A good trick in our game if you can pull that off! And so we’re off and running again and Match Of the Day is looking more than match fit at the grand old age of fifty. And perhaps this is just the right season for it to suck in its gut, trim the nose hairs and not buy its shirts from the supermarket. Al reckoned on Saturday night that ‘it’s thirteen teams that could go down’. While Ruud described the Premier League as now being ‘not weaker (but) interesting.' Well here’s to Match Of The Day echoing those words throughout its half century.","Match of the Day kicked off show's 50th anniversary on Saturday .

"A young Indian woman was beaten to death by members of her own family and her boyfriend beheaded in an horrific honour killing after they were lured back to their village thinking were going to be allowed to marry. Nidhi Barak, 20, a fine arts student, and Dharmender Barak, 23, who was studying at technical college, were killed last night as locals in Gharnavati village in the Indian state of Haryana watched on. The pair had eloped to nearby Delhi on Tuesday because their families did not approve of their relationship. Gruesome: The body of one of the two honor killing victims lies under a sheet in Gharnavati village in the Indian state of Haryana . But they had been lured back with promises that they would not be harmed and would finally be allowed to marry. Miss Barak's parents and uncle have been arrested and police are now trying to trace her brother and other family members who disappeared missing since the crime. According to police the couple were tortured for several hours at Miss Barak's home before she was beaten to death in full public view. Dharmender Barak . was beaten and his arms and legs broken, before he was beheaded. His . body was allegedly dumped near his family's home at a public square in . the village. Police, who had been alerted by a villager, reportedly caught Miss Barak's family cremating her body on a pyre. Her half-burnt body and that of Dharmender Barak have been sent for a post-mortem. Local police chief Anil Kumar said: 'While murdering the boy they also beheaded him. 'We . have arrested her father, mother and uncle and we are looking for her . brother, a friend and driver of the car in which the couple were brought . back to her home in Gharnavati village. 'Both belonged to the same village and the same caste. It is an honour killing but the murder was not approved by society.' Police say they discovered the girl's parents cremating her body on a pyre. The body of the boyfriend was dumped outside his family home . India has for centuries seen killings that often target young couples who have relationships of which their families, clans or communities, particularly in traditional rural areas, disapprove. Reasons for disapproval are numerous, but they sometimes include having relationships outside of their caste or religion. The killings are carried out by relatives to protect the family's reputation and pride. Police in Haryana have been conducting a campaign against honour killings in the state, where the sex-gender ratio is skewed in favour of men because of an outlawed but still existing tradition of female infanticide. 'We hold seminars and our women officers visit villages but the ultimate weapon against the scourge of honour killings is (more) education,' Kumar said. India's Supreme Court said in 2010 that the death penalty should be given to those found guilty of honour killings, calling the crime a barbaric 'slur' on the nation. There are no official figures on honour killings in India, but the All India Democratic Women's Association says its research shows about 1,000 such cases nationwide a year.","Nidhi Barak and boyfriend Dharmender Barak, 23, were killed last night .

"HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box. Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating. And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League. For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that. So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees. We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it. A few years ago, during a promotional event with some journalists at QPR’s Harlington training ground, one of the world’s finest central defenders made his way into the penalty area to wait for a corner. As the ball was launched in, he pulled down hard on his marker’s shirt on the blindside of the referee to prevent his opponent jumping and used it to propel himself into the air. He scored with a header easily enough and made the sap on the end of it look like he didn’t fancy aerial combat with a top class centre half (true, as it happened). John Terry ran away chuckling, laughing at the naivety more than anything (plus the fact he had swapped sides at half-time with his team leading 5-0 and had brought it back to five-all). For the avoidance of doubt this is not an attack on Terry’s integrity because he is one of the finest defenders this country has produced. At 33 he is playing better than ever in Chelsea colours. He did, however, provide a fascinating insight into the tricks of the trade used by players competing at the very highest level. Stuff goes on and the players just hope to hell that the referee doesn’t spot it or, if he does, lets you get away with it. Which brings us nicely to the official Phil Dowd, the poor fella who is still being given a good kicking three days on from Manchester United’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea. On Sunday afternoon, in the seconds before Robin van Persie’s dramatic equaliser for United, a text message arrived from the boss: ‘Are you mad?!’. Phil Dowd had his work cut out at Old Trafford on Sunday trying to spot all the grappling and wrestling . Sat in the Mail’s Kensington office he was reacting to a tweet, sent from the press box at Old Trafford, that had the audacity to praise Dowd’s performance involving two highly-charged teams who did not want to give an inch. Here is the offending tweet: ‘This isn’t terribly fashionable to say, but Phil Dowd has refereed this game brilliantly’. In the marks awarded on MailOnline, Dowd was given an eight out of 10. That’s a decent mark in the biggest game of the season and more than any of the players or the managers received. What a crime that turned out to be on an afternoon when people were not quite sure who was man of the match and who had the upper hand. Still, when in doubt, give the referee the mother of all kickings. Sitting at home, or in the office, it is easy to re-referee a football match when there are 26 (sometimes more) cameras inside a stadium. John Terry holds on to Marcos Rojo while defending a corner against Manchester United . Terry grabs Rojo while the Argentine holds Nemanja Matic's shirt and the Serb gives some back . Those replays, plus the commentary, along with full-time and half-time analysis, don’t half come in handy. Terry and Branislav Ivanovic were ‘double headlocked’ at ever corner according to Chelsea’s captain. The pictures of the pair grappling with Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo backed him up. Dowd was given an eight for, by and large, keeping these warring teams on the straight and narrow by issuing eight yellow cards and dismissing Ivanovic. The default mechanism in the game is thus: there is a man in authority, so give him the coating because the PGMOL, the match officials’ guardian angels, prevent the poor sucker defending himself in a post-match press conference. Match officials are soft, soft targets. Terry is bundled to the floor by Rojo (right) as Chris Smalling wrestles with Branislav Ivanovic (centre) As reporters, we will never have to justify ourselves to Dowd, or any other match official, because we rarely come across them (apart from a nod and a handshake at St George’s Park on international weeks). The players and managers are different because we are more likely to come across them in press conferences or in mixed zones down by the tunnel area. Gary Neville believed Juan Mata was Manchester United’s best player in the first half. By the time he was substituted in the 66th minute he had touched the ball just 35 times. Marouane Fellaini, the man who smothered Cesc Fabregas and is now apparently fully acclimatised to life at United, had the third worst passing record in the home team. Fabregas, subdued it has to be said, was upgraded to a seven because he provided the killer ball for Drogba to put Chelsea in front. Goals pay the rent and all that. Dowd (right) lays down the law to a smiling Cesc Fabregas during the clash at Old Trafford . Dowd dismisses Branislav Ivanovic (left) for a second bookable offence after a foul on Angel di Maria (right) Back to Dowd. To put his performance at Old Trafford into perspective, the PGMOL asked a 51-year-old man to make key decisions when he is trying to keep up with twenty-something footballers who often hoover 100 metres in less than 11 seconds. In addition we are asking a guy who is usually on the move to make the correct decision in a top class sporting arena with 22 players launching themselves into a full-bloodied contact in all areas of the pitch. Sat in the office, the boss will benefit from the 26 or more cameras stationed at Old Trafford to help the broadcaster, in this case Sky, come to a conclusion. Was Dowd right? ‘Well let’s take a look at the replay...’","John Terry provided insight into tricks during event at QPR years ago .

"A civil servant who made offensive alterations to Wikipedia pages on the Hillsborough disaster using Government computers has been sacked. The 24-year-old used the secure intranet to change the phrase 'You'll never walk alone' - the anthem of Liverpool FC - to 'You'll never walk again'. It was one of a slew of tweaks that began to emerge on the 20th anniversary of the April 1989 tragedy which saw 96 fans crushed. Offensive: A 24-year-old junior administrator, based in Liverpool, has been fired for using Government computers to make offensive tweaks to Wikipedia entries about the Hillsborough disaster, which killed 96 . He changed the phrase 'You'll never walk alone', the anthem of Liverpool FC, to 'You'll never walk again' Today, announcing the sacking to MPs, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude wrote: 'The Government has treated this matter with the utmost seriousness. 'Our position from the very start has been that the amendments made to Wikipedia are sickening. 'The behaviour is in complete contravention of the Civil Service Code, and every canon of civilised conduct. It is entirely unacceptable.' The junior administrator, based in . Liverpool but born in London, was identified by his web history uncovered by a Government-recruited cyber crime forensics team, in conjunction with research by internet group Wikipediocracy and the Daily Telegraph. The investigation was launched in April after 34 IP addresses of Whitehall computers were found to be complicit in the changes. Different users added the words ‘nothing for the victims of the Heysel . stadium disaster’ to a description of the Hillsborough memorial at the . Anfield stadium. The Wikipedia changes were part of a slew by Whitehall computers that investigators have failed to trace . Further . abusive revisions were traced to IP addresses of computers in the . Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Treasury and the Solicitor . General’s office. On . another occasion, the description of a statue of Liverpool manager Bill . Shankly on the Anfield Wikipedia page was revised to change the . well-known quote ‘He made the people happy’ to the bizarre ‘He made a . wonderful lemon drizzle cake’. After extensive inquiries, the . 24-year-old was identified as the author of a 2012 tweak, subjected to a . formal disciplinary investigation, and fired for gross misconduct. However, the investigation into other changes has been dropped due to a lack of leads. Data logs have been deleted, making it difficult to trace historic edits, Mr Maude explained.

'These . incidents have given rise to questions about the Government Secure . Intranet, about the way in which the internet is accessed from .

'We will continue to encourage and enable . civil servants to use the internet and social media, as essential tools . enabling them to work openly and to be connected to the society they . serve. 'But the misuse of social media is . unacceptable and carries consequences. We will be reminding all civil . servants of their responsibilities and updating social media guidance.'

Hillsborough Family Support Group, told the Daily Telegraph: 'We had a meeting . on Friday evening and all the families agreed that his name should be . withheld. 'He has been sacked, and we all took the decision not to name him because social media can be very unpleasant. 'The most important thing is that this has been dealt with and it has not been covered up. He has been punished.' 'Sickening': Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude (left) announced the sacking to MPs today, branding the alterations 'sickening'. Margaret Aspinall (right), spokesman for the victims' families, backed the move . Barry Devonside lost his son, Chris, 18, in the disaster. Mr Devonside, attending the Hillsborough Inquests in Warrington, said today: 'I'm absolutely delighted that the investigation has come to a conclusion and they have identified the individual who made sickening comments on Wikipedia. 'Clearly this 24-year-old civil servant has little or no regard for the families or any empathy for those killed. 'He's brought it on himself. The words he used were sickening and I'm glad the investigation by the Government has come to a conclusion and his career with the Civil Service has now ended.' Mr Maude added: 'I would like to thank . the families themselves for their patience during the weeks it has . taken to bring this matter to a conclusion. 'I was deeply distressed . that, at a time when the hearings of the Hillsborough Inquests were . unfolding, the Civil Service was brought into disrepute by these edits.

"A Montana man who painstakingly gathered and reassembled parts of five $100 bills eaten by his golden retriever has been reimbursed by the U.S. Treasury for the 'mutt-ilated' currency. Wayne Klinkel of Helena, Montana received a $500 check earlier this week. His 12-year-old dog, Sundance, downed all but half of one of the bills in December. Taste for money: Sundance, the golden retriever known for eating five $100 bills, rejects the taste of this check his owner Wayne Klinkel received after painstakingly reassembling parts of five $100 bills eaten by the dog last year . Sundance snacked on the cash in the family vehicle while Klinkel and his wife ate at a restaurant. They were on a road trip to visit their daughter in Colorado. However, when they returned to the car the money - aside from the dollar bill - was gone. 'I thought 'You dumb SOB,'' Klinkel told the Helena Independent Record. 'I couldn't believe he did that.' Klinkel says he carefully picked through the dog's droppings to recover parts of the bills and his daughter recovered more when the snow melted armed with rubber gloves for the rest of the vacation. Expensive tastes: Sundance managed to scoff five $100 bills when his owner Wayne Klinkel left him in his car - leaving a $1 note which was amidst the cash . Knowing that paper doesn't digest, he managed to pick portions of the gobbled notes out of the dog's poop. 'I . pretty much recovered two fairly complete bills, and had some other . pieces,' Klinkel said. 'But it wasn't nearly enough there to do anything . with it.' His . daughter's husband later found more pieces of the $100 bills and Church . brought them to her parent's home next time she visited. After letting the money soak in dish soap for a week, Klinkel drained and rinsed the pieces and let them dry. Refund? This is one of the five pieced together notes Klinkel sent to the treasury, wrapped in plastic bags and retrieved from Sundance's bathroom visits . He . then pieced the bills back together like a puzzle, taped them up and . put each note in its own plastic bag, according to the Record. He . took the recovered notes to a local bank where tellers laughed heartily . at his ordeal then suggested he send the mutilated currency to the . Treasury Department's Bureau of Engraving and Printing, with a letter . explaining how the money came to be destroyed. The notes were then sent to the U.S. Treasury in April of this year with an explanation. 'Sundance is notorious for eating anything and everything, so right away I knew what happened.' Klinkel followed the pet around armed with rubber gloves for the rest of the family vacation. 'I . pretty much recovered two fairly complete bills, and had some other . pieces,' Klinkel said. 'But it wasn't nearly enough there to do anything . with it.' His daughter's husband later found more pieces. Vacation work: Klinkel closely guarded his pet's poop while on vacation so he could piece together the bits of bills that remained . After letting the money soak in dish soap for a week, Klinkel drained and rinsed the pieces and let them dry. He took the recovered notes to a local bank where tellers laughed heartily at his ordeal then suggested he send the mutilated currency to the Treasury Department's Bureau of Engraving and Printing, with a letter explaining how the money came to be destroyed. He got a receipt for the bills 10 days later, and didn’t hear from the Treasury until he received the check earlier this week. 'I gave Sundance a pat, showed it to him and told him not to eat it,' said Klinkel. He said there wasn’t any correspondence with the check, but the memo section in the bottom left read: 'MUT.CURR REFUND.' He said that he wasn't angry with his beloved pet. 'Sundance may have eaten my money, but what he took he gives back in unconditional love,' Klinkel said.","Man left $500 in $100 bills in the back of his car but his Golden Retriever ate them all .

"Liberia plans to prosecute the airline passenger who brought Ebola into the U.S., alleging that he lied on an airport questionnaire about not having any contact with an infected person, authorities said on Thursday. Thomas Eric Duncan filled out a series of questions about his health and activities before leaving on his journey to Dallas, Texas on September 19. On the form he answered no to every question. Among other questions, the form asked whether Duncan had cared for an Ebola patient or touched the body of anyone who had died in an area affected by Ebola. Scroll down for video . Thomas Eric Duncan filled out a series of questions about his health and activities before leaving on his journey to Dallas, Texas on September 19. On the form he answered no to every question . Liberian nurses carry a dead body suspected of dying from the Ebola virus at the Roberts field highway on the outskirts of Monrovia last week. The country has been blighted with the deadly virus since last year which has spread through West Africa, killing close to 4,000 people . 'We expect people to do the honorable thing,' said Binyah Kesselly, chairman of the board of directors of the Liberia Airport Authority in Monrovia. The agency obtained permission from the Ministry of Justice to pursue the matter. Neighbors in the Liberian capital believe Duncan become infected when he helped bundle a sick pregnant neighbor into a taxi a few weeks ago and set off with her to find treatment. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told CBC today that she was 'very angry' that Mr Duncan had left Liberia after being exposed to Ebola and that his actions were 'unpardonable'. She said that she hoped no one else would be infected with the virus in the U.S. United Airlines, which on Wednesday revealed Duncan had flown on its flights from Brussels to Washington Dulles and then from Dulles to Dallas, said it had given a 'thorough cleaning' to both planes he was on. Despite Duncan spreading Ebola to the United States, a U.N. spokesman believes air travel to and from the West African countries affected by the Ebola virus should continue. Meanwhile, a leading member of the Liberian community in Dallas told MailOnline that Duncan should never have gotten on the plane to the U.S. having been in recent contact with an Ebola patient. Roslyn Seyon said: 'If those reports are true...I don't think it was a good idea to get on that plane. 'Every person has their own conscience. 'If I was in that position I don't know what I would do. My own judgement would be not (to travel) but that's just me. 'I think about others, that's what we call selflessness and if I was in Liberia and got infected I would consider being checked and not trying to infect others.' Miss Seyon, Vice President of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, added that she hoped Ebola was contained quickly in the U.S. Records: A  copy of a passenger health screening form filled out by Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan is seen here . Questioned: Passengers are questioned about their contact with Ebola patients before they are allowed to leave the country. Duncan is accused of lying on his questionnaire . Stephane Dujarric told reporters Thursday that 'it's very important not to isolate these countries' as it would worsen their political and economic situations. He says aid groups need access to the region. In Texas, health officials have reached out to about 100 people who may have had direct contact with the man who brought Ebola into the U.S. or someone close to him, a public-health spokeswoman said Thursday. None of the people are showing symptoms, but health authorities have educated them about Ebola and told them to notify medical workers if they begin to feel ill. The group will be monitored to see if anyone seeks medical care during the three weeks immediately following the time of contact, said Erikka Neroes, of the Dallas County Health and Human Services agency. Ebola symptoms can include fever, muscle pain, vomiting and bleeding, and can appear as long as 21 days after exposure to the virus. The disease is not contagious until symptoms begin. It spreads only by close contact with an infected person's bodily fluids. The 80 people include 12 to 18 who came in direct contact with the infected man, as well as others known to have had contact with them, she said. 'This is a big spider web' of people involved, Neroes said. Teams of cleaning crews have been scrubbing four Dallas schools attended by children who came in direct contact with Mr Duncan while he was contagious with Ebola. Parents have been pulling their kids out of classes as a precaution . The initial group includes three members of the ambulance crew that took Duncan to the hospital, plus a handful of schoolchildren. Health officials are focusing on containment to try to stem the possibility of the Ebola virus spreading beyond Duncan, who arrived in Dallas on Sept. 20 to visit relatives and fell ill a few days later. His sister, Mai Wureh, identified Duncan as the infected man. A Dallas emergency room sent Duncan home last week, even though he told a nurse that he had been in disease-ravaged West Africa. The decision by Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to release Duncan could have put others at risk of exposure to Ebola before the man went back to the ER a couple of days later when his condition worsened. The patient explained to a nurse last Thursday that he was visiting the U.S. from Africa, but that information was not widely shared, said Dr. Mark Lester, who works for the hospital's parent company. Hospital epidemiologist Dr. Edward Goodman said the patient had a fever and abdominal pain during his first ER visit, not the riskier symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea. Duncan was diagnosed with a low-risk infection and sent home, Lester said. The hospital is reviewing how the situation would have been handled if all staff had been aware of the man's circumstances. But the diagnosis, and the hospital's slip-up, highlighted the wider threat of Ebola, even far from Africa. 'The scrutiny just needs to be higher now,' said Dr. Rade Vukmir, a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. Duncan has been kept in isolation at the hospital since Sunday. He was listed Thursday in serious but stable condition. Duncan's neighborhood, a collection of tin-roofed homes, has been ravaged by Ebola. So many people have fallen ill that neighbors are too frightened to comfort a nine-year-old girl who lost her mother to the disease. The 19-year-old pregnant woman was convulsing and complaining of stomach pain, and everyone thought her problems were related to her pregnancy, in its seventh month. No ambulance would come for her, and the group that put her in a taxi never did find a hospital. She died, and in the following weeks, all the neighbors who helped have gotten sick or died, neighbors said. Ebola is believed to have sickened more than 7,100 people in West Africa and killed more than 3,300, according to the World Health Organization. Liberia is one of the three countries hit hardest in the epidemic, along with Sierra Leone and Guinea.","Thomas Eric Duncan filled out questions about his health and activities before leaving on his journey to Dallas - he answered no to all of them .

"One New York City cop gave the sweater he was wearing to a homeless man who was dressed only in a thermal undershirt Friday when temperatures dropped to 23 degrees. Officer Carlos Ramos, 29, was assigned to look for suspicious activity near the United Nations in midtown Manhattan when he spotted Robert William sitting on a sidewalk outside the Robert Moses Park dog run. William was sitting barefoot because his shoes had gotten soaked, and had taken off his other shirt to try and wrap it around his freezing cold feet. Warm heart: NYPD Transit Bureau officer Carlos Ramos stopped and gave Robert William a sweater off his back in the frigid New York morning on Friday . Grateful: Robert Williams' shoes were wet and he had only a thermal undershirt on . 'I saw he was in need and it was my job to help him,' Ramos told the New York Daily News. 'I saw he had no coat,' he said. 'It was a very cold day, because I was very cold even bundled up.' He offered the thick, navy blue Champion sweatshirt he was wearing under his uniform and coat to William, who initially refused. 'My concern was for him - his concern was for me staying warm,' Ramos told the Daily News. Ramos finally convinced William to take the sweatshirt. 'He gave it to me. He said, ""Don’t worry about it,""' William told the New York Post. 'I felt good about having it.' Makeshift: After Ramos left, William, wearing his new sweater, tore up his shirt to wear as socks . The warmhearted officer told the Daily News that he regularly helps people out, especially when the weather is cold. 'A nice cup of coffee, a tea, whatever seems appropriate,' he said. Ramos has been a NYPD officer since 2007. He works in anti-crime and counterterrorism for the Transit Bureau. William told the New York Post that he doesn't know how long he's been homeless for, but that he used to live uptown at West 163rd and St Nicholas Ave before an argument with a roommate saw him turfed out onto the streets. Good Samaritan: Larry DePrimo won a host of fans last November when a photograph of him kneeling down to give a pair of boots to a homeless man in Times Square went viral . As winter sets in and temperatures drop below , the plight of homeless people who make their beds on the streets of New York City becomes critical. Ramos' warm-hearted deed comes almost exactly a year after New York police officer Larry DePrimo won fans after buying Jeffrey Hillman, 54, a homeless man, a pair of boots. Hillman was sitting barefoot in Times Square with blisters on his feet from the cold. DePrimo bought Hillman a $100 pair of Sketcher's boots from a nearby store after Hillman told him he was fine - and that he'd never had a pair of shoes. DePrimo was recently promoted to detective.","Officer Carlos Ramos saw Robert William shivering in the freezing New York weather on Friday morning .

"A Florida woman sentenced to 20 years in prison after firing a warning shot during an argument with her abusive husband has been released on bond while she awaits retrial under a controversial part of the state's self-defense law. Marissa Alexander was convicted of aggravated-assault with a deadly weapon, which caused a furor when her supporters compared it to the self-defense case of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted earlier this year of murdering an unarmed black teenager. The case drew criticism from civil . rights groups concerned about self-defense laws and mandatory minimum . sentencing rules, but it received little attention outside north Florida . until the Zimmerman case. New trial: Marissa Alexander at her bond hearing Nov. 13, 2013, in Jacksonville, Florida. Alexander is getting a new trial after a court overturned her 20-year prison sentence for firing what she called a warning shot at her husband . Free for now: Although no one was injured in Alexander's case, the court gave her a 20-year prison sentence under the state's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines. Critics cried racism and their case was strengthened after George Zimmerman was found not guilty . Although no one was injured in . Alexander's case, the court gave her a 20-year prison sentence under the . state's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines because she had fired a . gun during the assault. A state appeals court ruled in September that Alexander, who is black, deserved a new trial because the judge failed to properly instruct the Jacksonville, Florida jury about her self-defense argument. She was convicted in May 2012. 'This news is vindication for Marissa and all the women who have become criminalized for exercising their basic right to defend themselves and their children,' Angie Nixon of Florida New Majority, a social justice organization, said of Alexander's release. Zimmerman was arrested for killing Trayvon Martin in 2012 and was acquitted of murder and manslaughter in July 2013. Under the so-called Stand Your Ground clause which was added to Florida's self-defense law in 2005, people who use deadly force to defend themselves from serious injury - rather than retreating to avoid confrontation - can be immune from prosecution. Zimmerman never sought immunity under Stand Your Ground, instead relying on a standard self-defense law. Alexander, who had never been arrested before, has said she fired a bullet to scare off her husband when she felt he was threatening her. No one was hurt, but the judge in the case said he was bound by state law to sentence her to 20 years in prison after she was convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Racism? The case drew criticism from civil rights groups concerned about self-defense laws and mandatory minimum sentencing rules, but it received little attention outside north Florida until the Zimmerman case . Alexander's Stand Your Ground claim was . rejected because she left the house during the confrontation to retrieve . a gun from her car, returning to fire a shot near her husband Rico . Gray's head. A slightly built woman who stands 5 feet 2 inches, Alexander said her 245-pound husband was about to attack her when she fired into a kitchen wall during the August 2010 incident. He had previously been convicted of domestic violence for attacking her. Prosecutors said the shot endangered Gray. At the time, Alexander had an active restraining order against her husband and she carried a concealed weapons permit. State Attorney Angela Corey, who oversaw the prosecution of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, has stood by the handling of Alexander's case. Corey said she believes that Alexander aimed the gun at the man and his two sons, and that the bullet she fired could have ricocheted and hit any of them. Stood her ground? A slightly built woman who stands 5 feet 2 inches, Alexander said her 245-pound husband was about to attack her when she fired into a kitchen wall in 2010 .

"Three men who abducted a vulnerable 13-year-old girl from the streets of London and forced her to become their sex slave have been jailed. The girl, who was described as being from a broken and troubled family, was subjected to sexual abuse over four days after being persuaded to travel with the men to Ipswich in Suffolk in July last year. Mohammed Sheikh, Hamza Ali and Suran Uddin were all convicted of trafficking and sex offences following a trial. Jailed: Mohammed Sheikh, left, will serve eight years in prison while Hamza Ali, right, will serve five . Today at Norwich Crown Court, Judge Nicholas Coleman said the girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, had been left traumatised by the ordeal. Sex offender: Suran Uddin was jailed for 15 years for the abduction and sexual assault of a vulnerable 13-year-old he found on the streets of London along with two other men . 'Instead of helping this girl find refuge, you were all intent on sexually exploiting her for your own ends,' he added. 'She was taken to a town she'd never visited, a house she had never been to, in the company of men she had never met. 'All three of you treated her like a piece of meat and passed her about. This happened over four days until she was finally rescued by police.' Uddin was jailed for 15 years, Sheikh will serve eight years and Ali five years. All three were placed on the sex offenders register and Sheikh and Ali could face deportation to Somalia, their home country. Jurors heard how the men took advantage of the girl's 'youth and naivety' to persuade her to get into a van, driven by Uddin. They took her to a house in Chevallier Street, Ipswich. Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones said: . 'They plied her with drugs and alcohol and made promises that they would . take care of her and give her anything she wanted. 'She was treated as little more than a skivvy and she was raped over the course of four days.' Maria Denine, mitigating for Sheikh said the defendants had not been aware of her background or how vulnerable she was. Mitigating . for Uddin, Scott Ivill said his client was married with two children, . aged eight and one, and any custodial sentence would cause his family to . suffer. Lindsay Cox, for Ali, said his client was also a married man. Norwich Crown Court heard the men took the 13-year-old girl to a house on Chevallier Street, Ipswich (pictured) Sentencing the trio at Norwich Crown Court today, a judge said they had treated the 13-year-old girl 'like a piece of meat' He added: 'This girl looked appreciably older than her age and she had a history of engaging with strangers.' Uddin, 26, of Bethnal Green, London; Sheikh, 32, of Hackney, London; and Ali, 39, of Waltham Forest, London, were all found guilty of conspiracy to traffic in the UK. Uddin was also convicted of two counts of rape and supplying a class B drug to the victim. Sheikh was convicted of causing a child to engage in sexual activity and supplying a class B drug. Ali was found guilty of a sexual assault. A fourth defendant, Abdul Hammed, 46, of Wellington Street, Ipswich, was cleared of supplying a class B drug, two counts of rape and trafficking.","Mohammed Sheikh, Hamza Ali and Suran Uddin convicted of trafficking and sex offences at Norwich Crown Court .

"Lying at the side of the road in a busy marketplace in Sierra Leone the body of an Ebola victim is left abandoned. The corpse was covered with leaves as dozens of people looked on, unsure what to do in the wake of a strike by burial teams in the capital, Freetown. Bodies were left in homes and on the streets after a row over a week-long backlog in hazard pay. Scroll down for video . Health workers take samples from the body of an Ebola victim lies at the side of a busy marketplace in Freetown, Sierra Leone, after a strike by burial teams over hazard pay left corpses abandoned across the city . Anxious members of the public line the streets looking on, unsure what to in the wake of the strike by 600 volunteer burial workers, paid 100 U.S. dollars a week in hazard pay . Returning back to work once the dispute had been 'resolved' volunteers move in to pick up the body, covering it with a sheet as they spray disinfectant on the steps . The burial team lay out a sheet of plastic on the street to help move the body with minimal contact . The teams are supposed to be paid up to 100 U.S. dollars each week to remove the bodies of Ebola victims. But after a row over non-payment of the money, the workers went on strike - and the bodies began to pile up by the side of the roads. At the point of death, the virus is at its most virulent. It means the corpses pose a considerable risk in an already volatile environment where the virus is surging through communities, claiming hundreds of lives each day. The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation reported bodies of those who had died from the virus were being left in homes and on the streets of Freetown. The victim's body is moved on to the plastic sheet by the workers decked out in protective clothing . The teams, wearing face masks and goggles, load the body into the back of a waiting van ready to transport it away before laying the man to rest . A woman faints after volunteers take away the body of a woman who died from the virus in Waterloo, 30km south east of the capital Freetown . A volunteer wearing a protective suit to spray disinfectant outside a home in Waterloo, before removing the body of a female Ebola victim from the home . Officials today said the dispute had been 'resolved', paving the way for teams to return to work and clear the backlog of bodies amassing as a result of the strike. Ebola's economic toll could reach more than £20billion by the end of 2014 if the disease ravaging Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone spreads across West Africa. The outbreak has the potential ‘to inflict massive economic costs’ on those three countries and its closest neighbours, the World Bank said today. Its report estimated the costs of two scenarios: . Jim Yong Kim, the bank's president, said: ‘The international community must find ways to get past logistical roadblocks and bring in more doctors and trained medical staff, more hospital beds and more health and development support to help stop Ebola in its tracks.’ ‘Prudent’ investment in better health systems could have lessened the economic fallout, he added. Concerns about the disease are causing neighbouring countries to close their borders, and airlines and businesses to suspend commercial activities in the three worst-affected countries. Deputy health minister Madina Rahman told a radio programme this morning the dispute centered on a one-week backlog for hazard pay, which had been deposited in the bank, but was not given to the workers on time. 'The health ministry is going to investigate the delay in the health workers not receiving their money,' she said. The burial teams make up a total of 600 workers organized in groups of 12, health ministry spokesman Sidie Yahya Tunis said. Tunis described the situation as 'very embarrassing'. The government was already facing criticism this week over a shipping container filled with medical gear and mattresses that has been held up at the port for more than a month. The World Health Organization says Ebola is believed to have killed more than 600 people in Sierra Leone, where there have been more than 2,100 confirmed cases . More than 3,400 people have been killed by the outbreak in West Africa, which has hit Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia hardest. In Spain, officials said a nurse and a nursing assistant have been placed under observation for Ebola in a Madrid hospital where a colleague became infected after working with two Spanish missionary priests who contracted the disease in West Africa and later died at the centre. It was not known whether the two also treated the two priests or the infected colleague. The infected nursing assistant is the first person known to catch the disease outside the outbreak zone in West Africa during the current epidemic. She is said to be in stable condition. Volunteers in Waterloo, Sierra Leone are forced to bury the dead after burial teams reportedly took strike action. The country's deputy health minister said today the dispute has been resolved . Meanwhile in Liberia, efforts have been stepped up to ensure the bodies of victims are buried as soon as possible to try and halt the spread of the virus . The dead bodies of Ebola victims are highly contagious, and if not disposed of promptly can further spread of the  virus, which has so far killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa .

Spanish authorities are investigating how the nursing assistant became infected. They are also monitoring some 50 people who came into contact with her or also tended the two priests that died. Health authorities in Madrid have faced accusations of not following protocol and poorly preparing health care workers for dealing with Ebola.","Local media reported bodies were left in homes and on streets of Freetown .

"Shaul Spitzer set Aron Rottenberg alight outside the family home . Victim suffered third-degree burns to more than 50 per cent of his body and was in hospital for over a month . Pleaded guilty and faces up to 10 years imprisonment . A Hasidic Jewish teenager pleaded guilty to assault, for setting a neighbour on fire because he wasn't praying with the rest of the community. Shaul Spitzer, 18, of New Square, New York, had been accused of severely burning Aron Rottenberg, 43, . with a firebomb outside Mr Rottenberg's home in New Square, an insular . Hasidic village of 7,000. He pleaded guilty to assault in a New . York court and faces up to 10 years in prison, although Judge William . Kelly said he would likely receive a 5-year sentence. Shaul Spitzer, 18, of New Square, New York, had been accused of severely burning neighbor Aron Rottenberg, 43, . with a firebomb outside Rottenberg's home in New Square . Mr Rottenberg alleged that Twersky was angered because Rottenberg had stopped praying at his synagogue, disobeying a prayer order by the Grand Rebbe of the Hasidic enclave about 35 miles north of New York City. Spitzer, who worked for Grand Rebbe David Twersky, admitted that he used a heavy duty propane lighter to set Rottenberg on fire in May 2011. It happened after Mr Rottenberg . confronted Spitzer when he thew a bag of burning shirts soaked in petrol . on the porch of his home. Mr Rottenberg suffered third-degree burns to more than 50 per cent of his body and prosecutor Stephen Moore said he spent more than a month in the hospital recovering. Painful recovery: Aron Rottenberg suffered third-degree burns to more than 50 per cent of his body and prosecutor Stephen Moore said he spent more than a month in the hospital recovering . Crime scene: Court documents said Rottenberg's family had received several threats and had their property vandalised for not praying in the community's main synagogue . Spitzer also had burns on his hands and arms. 'We just both burst into flames,' Mr Rottenberg said. The family was sleeping inside, court documents said. Mr Rottenberg claimed in a lawsuit that Spitzer was acting at the direction of the village's Chief Rabbi, David Twersky. He alleged that rabbi Twersky was angered because Mr Rottenberg had stopped praying at his synagogue. The rabbi denied involvement, criticised the attack and was not charged. Spitzer's lawyers also said the rabbi was uninvolved their client acted alone. Court documents said Mr Rottenberg's family . had received several threats and had their property vandalised for not . praying in the community's main synagogue. Spitzer, who will be sentenced in April, entered his plea on the day jury selection was set to begin in the case said defence attorney Deborah . Lowenberg. Under the plea deal, charges of attempted murder and arson were dismissed. Mr Rottenberg was in court and told the judge he consented to the plea deal. Ms Lowenberg said sect leaders didn't pressure Spitzer to accept the plea bargain to avoid a trial. 'Mr. Spitzer took counsel only from the defense team,' she said. 'We understood the evidence was very strong against our client and explained to him that there was a significant risk of facing 25 years. 'This way, he has the peace of mind of knowing the sentence won't be more than 10 years,' she added. 'We hope to show the judge that a less severe sentence would be appropriate.' Outside court, Spitzer's attorney Kenneth Gribetz said his client had been trying to cause mischief, not to kill anyone. 'This is a young boy who has no criminal intent,' he said. 'He's not a criminal ... He should be given a chance to get back on the right track.' Rottenburg has a pending civil lawsuit against Spitzer and Rabbi Twersky stemming from the incident. Gribetz said in court a settlement in the $2 million range was under discussion. New Square is about 30 miles north of Manhattan. Nearly all of its residents are members of the Skver Hasidic sect. The sect and the village are named for the Ukrainian village of Skver, where its members were killed during the Holocaust.","Shaul Spitzer set Aron Rottenberg alight outside the family home .

"A college in Texas has sent out letters to applicants from Nigeria telling them they will not be admitted to the school because of Ebola. Kamorudeen Abidogun said he received two rejection letters from Navarro College, near Dallas, saying that the school is not accepting international students from countries with confirmed Ebola cases. The mechanical engineer, who is originally from Nigeria but now lives in Richmond, has five relatives in Nigeria who were applying to the school  using his home mailing address.

After stating that the two-year community college is unable to offer the recipient acceptance for the Spring 2015 term, it quite clearly reads: 'Navarro College is not accepting international students from countries with confirmed Ebola cases.' 'I received, last weekend, two rejection letters...saying the reason why they were not giving admission was...Ebola,' Mr Abidogun told the news channel. He said he was 'disappointed' in the school's stated policy. Navarro's vice president for Access and Accountability, Dewayne Gragg, sent an email to CNBC after repeated requests from the station for comments on the situation.

"Wealthy African buyers are spending almost £4million on London property every week as they look to snap up exclusive investments in the UK, it has emerged. Super-rich oligarchs are taking their vast resources and investing them in the safe haven of London property - with more than £600million spent in the capital in the past three years. A mixture of traditional reasons combined with increased terrorism and the outbreak of Ebola is said to be behind the dramatic influx of African money to the capital. Scroll down for video . Super-rich African oligarchs are taking their vast resources and investing them in the safe haven of London property - with more than £600million spent in the capital in the past three years and £4million spent in the city every week. They favour the likes of One Hyde Park . Folorunsho Alakija, a billionaire oil tycoon, fashion designer and philanthropist from Lagos, is a big investor in the London market . The wealthy buyers are typically spending between £15million and £25million on each home and are purchasing luxury properties . Beauchamp Estates, which sells some of London's most expensive homes, said properties such as the one above are those favoured . While African buyers only account for 1.5 per of transactions in the 'ultra prime' London market, they make up five per cent of sales by value - up from two per cent. This is by typically spending between £15million and £25million on each home. The recent Ebola epidemic and continued terrorism from groups such as Boko Haram has resulted in an increase in buyers in recent months. Beauchamp Estates, which sells some of London's most expensive homes, today released a report on African buyers in the capital. The upmarket estate agency said the buyers are coming from six countries - Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Gabon, Cameroon and Senegal. Nigerians are the biggest spenders, with wealthy nationals forking out £250million on London homes in the last three years. The new wave of super-rich includes Aliko Dangote, a Nigerian business magnate who, with a £16billion fortune, is Africa's wealthiest man. Folorunsho Alakija, a billionaire oil tycoon, fashion designer and philanthropist from Lagos, is also a big investor in the London property market. She recently bought four apartments in One Hyde Park, the super-exclusive development in Knightsbridge. Her British-born nephew Rotimi Alakija, who also goes by the stage name of DJ Xclusive, has also invested property in the capital. It is thought other tycoons have also been eyeing up homes on Kensington Palace Gardens - known as Billionaires' Row.

African buyers make up five per cent of sales by value in the 'ultra prime' London market - up from two per cent in recent years . Beauchamp Estates said the African buyers are coming from six countries - Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Gabon, Cameroon and Senegal . The super-rich look to buy luxury property in the 'platinum triangle' which is made up of Mayfair, Belgravia and Knightsbridge . Gary Hersham, managing director of Beauchamp Estates, revealed he has had three super-rich Nigerians enquiring about homes in the past week alone. This is despite the average person in Nigeria earning just £850 per year. He said: 'I've had an upturn in African buyers over the last few months. 'The situation in West Africa at present is pushing rich African buyers back into Central London at a significantly higher level than is normally experienced. 'While war, disease and terrorism in West Africa grab media headlines, actually for super-rich Africans its domestic wealth, cultural ties to London, general safety and education for their children that are the key attractions for buying a home in central London.' Mr Hersham said these super-rich look to buy property in the 'platinum triangle' which is made up of Mayfair, Belgravia and Knightsbridge. Around 80 per cent spend between £15million to £25million on a residential property, with ten per cent spending more than £30million. If they are not buying, they are renting luxury homes for up to £15,000-per-week and staying for between six weeks and three months per year. London's reputation for having a residential property market, which is secure and a stable investment, is one of the main reasons wealthy Africans are buying, according to Beauchamp Estates. Another reason is historic cultural and community ties. Nigeria is a Commonwealth country and there is a community of 70,000 in London. There are a similar number of Ghanaians in the capital.

The third reason is education, with King's School Canterbury, Wycombe Abbey, Cheltenham Ladies College, Eton, Harrow and Bradfield are among the favourite private schools for wealthy families from Africa. According to the Nigerian embassy, Nigerian nationals spend more than £300million-a-year on tutoring, accommodation, fees and equipment at British schools and universities. Mr Hersham added: 'It is going to be the African century. 'Continental African buyers or luxury tenants in London are currently where the Russians and Ukrainians were five years ago. 'At present virtually all the transactions are for end use, not rental investment, which indicates that the African buyer market in London has significant room for growth and maturity. 'Nigerians have been long standing property purchasers in the central London market, going back to the early 1980s. 'However, in the 1980s and 1990s they typically purchased houses in North London, in Hampstead, St Johns Wood and Primrose Hill. 'Now, enhanced wealth has enabled them to move into the ultra prime market in Mayfair, Belgravia and Knightsbridge, and have been joined by affluent purchasers from other West African and French equatorial states.'","Super-rich oligarchs spending almost £4million-a-week on London property, new report by estate agent reveals .

"A study by the British Heart Foundation has shown that portions of food have doubled in the past 20 years . Britain’s supermarkets are ‘out of control’ when it comes to portion sizes, according to a study by the British Heart Foundation (BHF). Despite the deepening obesity crisis portion sizes continue to rise, and are now double the size they were in 1993. An average chicken curry and rice ready meal is now 53 per cent larger than in 1993, and a shepherd’s pie meal is about double the size. Crumpets and garlic bread are from 20 to 30 per cent bigger now, while an average bagel has increased in size by 24 per cent. To gain a pound in weight, a person need only consume an additional 3,500 calories and the massive increase in portion sizes explains why so many people are unwittingly putting on excess pounds. As well as fuelling the growing obesity problem, the BHF said that oversized food portions were also contributing to heart disease, currently the UK's single biggest killer. Portion sizes of 245 products sold in Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, and Morrison’s were compared with portions sizes listed by the Food Standards Agency in a 1993 in the study, the Times reports. The BHF has claimed that the oversized portions are damaging the health of the nation and has urged both the Scotish and Westminster governments to take urgent action to curb the proportions of food sold in supermarkets. Despite the new regulations over . labelling of food which aim to make it easier for consumers to make . informed choices over what they eat, the study showed that many are . still confused. ASDA was one of the four major supermarkets that had its portion sizes investigated in the study, along with Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons . Bagels have increased by 24 per cent in the last 20 years, while a curry ready meal is 53 per cent bigger . The rules stipulate that nutritional information must be clearly displayed on the front of packaging, using a ‘traffic light’ colour code and showing the salt, fat, sugar and caloric content of 100g of the product. The BHF surveyed 140 people and many reported still being unsure about the content and correct portion sizes of their food. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the BHF says of the findings: ‘We urgently need a government review of portion sizes in the UK,’ ‘We are calling on supermarkets and manufacturers to take their share of responsibility for how much we eat.’ One portion of bread is considered as just a single slice . One portion: . One slice of bread . Half a baked potato . Half a pitta bread . Half a scone . Two small boiled potatoes . One portion: . Lean meat - the size of a deck of cards (75g cooked) Fish - the size of a cheque book (75g oily fish or 150g white fish) Eggs - two boiled eggs . Baked Beans - five tablespoons or half a can . One portion: . Milk - 200ml . Hard cheese - size of a match box (30g) Yogurt - 150ml or a small pot . One Portion: . Medium fruit - one apple, pear or orange etc .

"Researchers are rushing to develop a pin-prick test for Ebola that could cut life-saving days off the amount of time it takes to confirm cases of the deadly virus. Scientists say developing a test for Ebola that gives an instant result could be vital is stopping the march of the disease, which has killed more than 4,000 people in west Africa so far and is spreading. Scientists at Tulane University in Louisiana are working in conjunction with the Viral Haemorragic Fever Consortium in Sierra Leone on a simple pin-prick test to provide an instant Ebola diagnosis. Scroll down for video . Nurses at Ebola treatment centres like this one in Monrovia, Liberia, could use a rapid diagnostic test that identifies the killer disease in minutes rather than days . Airports around the world are introducing thermometer tests to determine whether passengers have symptoms of Ebola, such as fever . But the temperature tests do not determine whether a passenger is carrying the deadly disease . Dr Robert Garry, professor of microbiology at Tulane, said early diagnosis of the disease is vital when it comes to preventing its spread. Under current protocols it can take three days for a blood sample to be tested in a lab which can increase the risk of a patient transmitting Ebola to other people. In addition to reducing the wait time for results, the system under development uses a simple pin-prick device that dramatically reduces the chance of healthcare workers suffering needle-stick injuries associated with traditional long syringes. 'Everyone has their shoulder to the wheel to get this done,' Dr Garry told Nola.com. He said his team has been working around the clock to increase the accuracy of the test which is designed to identify the specific proteins associated with the disease. The research is being backed by $2.9 million grant. The new system is undergoing a series of tests to determine its accuracy. Once his team is convinced the test works, Dr Garry said it was hoped the US Food and Drug Administration will fast-track authorisation so the test can be deployed at airports and in the field. A rapid system of identifying Ebola could help stop the spread of the deadly virus . Researchers hope the FDA will fast-track their diagnosis test so it can be deployed as quickly as possible .

"A germ-killing robot designed to rid a room of dangerous viruses in minutes is being used to keep hospitals Ebola-free. Called 'Little Moe', the robot works by damaging viral DNA using pulses of ultraviolet light. It is currently being used in 250 hospitals and health facilities across the US, including a Dallas hospital where a patient with the first case of Ebola diagnosed in America is being treated. Scroll down for video . San Antonia-based Xenex has designed a robot called Little Moe (pictured) that can kill viruses. It works by using pulses of xenon light to disinfect surfaces in five minutes. Blasts of light are sent out in a 10ft (three metre) radius every 1.5 seconds. This can remove Ebola from surfaces in a room in just two minutes . Little Moe was created by San Antonia-based company Xenex. The robot rolls around on four wheels and uses xenon, a non-toxic gas, to create the ultraviolet rays needed to destroy viruses. Ebola emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo. There are several strains, which vary in how dangerous they are to humans, but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent. In the current outbreak it is just over 50 per cent. The virus is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats, which are eaten as a delicacy. Symptoms include fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. People are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days. Source: World Health Organisation . It blasts 1.5 pulses per second up to ten feet (three metres) in every direction to kill viruses including Ebola. Light that is 25,000 times bright than sunlight is created in each flash. The robot was first made available in 2010 and each unit costs £65,000 ($104,000). 'Our robot ensures the room is safe for the next patient by destroying germs on high-touch surfaces, and in hard to clean nooks and crannies,' a spokesperson for Xenex said. Ebola, however, is actually easier to kill than other infectious diseases such as superbugs that mutate and become immune to disinfection. It takes just two minutes for the robot to destroy Ebola on a surface, while other viruses can be eradicated in five minutes. Such technology, using UV rays to sterilise a room, has been around for decades, but Little Moe speeds up the process by using xenon in place of mercury. By comparison, a mercury-based UV machine takes up to an hour to disinfect a room. 'Our mission has always been to eliminate the pathogens that cause the infections that impact the health and lives of millions of patients and their families, and Ebola is no different,' Xenex said in a statement. Little Moe costs £65,000 ($104,000) and is already being used in 250 hospitals across the US to stop the spread of Ebola. The robot rolls around on four wheels and uses xenon, a non-toxic gas, to create the ultraviolet rays needed to destroy viruses .

"A heartbreaking new video of the Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Islamic extremists shows them bravely speaking out about their ordeal for the first time. The footage, not released publicly but seen by The Mail on Sunday, was taken in a jungle clearing a month after their abduction. More than 250 girls were taken in a raid on their school in Chibok, in Nigeria’s north-east, on April 14 by Boko Haram terrorists, who want to impose Sharia law on the country. The 270 girls are being held by Islamic group Boko Haram after they were abducted from Chibok, in north eastern Nigeria . The girls in the video look healthy, but it is understood that fraught negotiations are under way to broker the release several pupils who have fallen ill, including one with a broken wrist. In the video, eight girls, dressed in their home-made school uniforms of pale blue gingham, plead for release as they stand courageously in front of the camera. They are clearly scared, upset and trying to be brave. Each of them walks in turn to a spot in front of a white sheet fixed to a crude frame between the trees. Four of them can be heard clearly, in their Hausa language, stating that they were taken by force and that they are hungry. A tall girl, aged about 18, says tearfully: ‘My family will be so worried.’ Another, speaking softly, says: ‘I never expected to suffer like this in my life.’ A third says: ‘They have taken us away by force.’ The fourth girl complains: ‘We are not getting enough food.’ Terror leader Abubakar Shekau released a video of the kidnapped girls praying after their conversion to Islam . The video, taken by an intermediary on May 19, has been shown to President Goodluck Jonathan. It was intended to serve as ‘proof of life’ for the girls and to encourage the President to accede to the terrorists’ demands. Two earlier videos showed the girls seated on the ground, dressed in hijabs, reciting the Koran, and Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau declaring he would sell them into slavery, or marry them off to their kidnappers, if members of his sect were not released from prison. Pressure from the international community and criticism of the President’s slow response to the kidnapping have led to a series of contradictory pronouncements from his government. Ministers have declared they will not negotiate with Boko Haram, or consider the release of prisoners, while official spokesmen have said ‘the window is always open for dialogue’. Deborah Peter told US congress members how Boko Haram killed her family in 2011 and called for the release of the kidnapped girls . At a Paris peace summit, several West African countries neighbouring Nigeria vowed to join in ‘outright war’ against the terrorists. Britain, France and America pledged their support and have sent teams of military experts and advisers to the region. Intelligence sources have told the MoS of several rescue attempts, one  involving the release of suspected low-level Boko Haram members detained without charges or trial. Two attempts were aborted at the last minute when the terrorists took fright while delivering a group of girls to a safe location. Last week Nigeria’s Chief of Defence Alex Badeh said  the government knew the location of the girls and claimed that police and military had been ‘following them’ since the abduction. He refused to divulge details, saying it would put the girls in further danger. Martha Mark holds up a photograph of her daughter Monica who is one of the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram . Sources said Mr Badeh’s announcement may have been the result of government officials seeing the new, unpublished video. They may have been able to persuade Boko Haram’s intermediary to provide details of the location. It is believed the hostages have been split into at least four groups. Dr Stephen Davis, an Australian who has advised three Nigerian presidents on how to negotiate with the country’s militant groups, has spent the past month trying to help free the girls. ‘The vast majority of the  Chibok girls are not being held in Nigeria,’ he said. ‘They are in camps across the Nigerian border in Cameroon, Chad and Niger. I say the “vast majority” as I know a small group was confirmed to me to be in Nigeria last week when we sought to have them released.’ The Nigerian government has been engaged in negotiations with Boko Haram's spiritual leader Abubakar Shekau in a bid to secure the girls' release . He described how fraught the negotiation process has been. ‘One of that small group of girls is ill and we had hoped we might convince the commander of the group holding her that she should be released so we could give her medical treatment,’ Dr Davis said. ‘There are other girls who are not well and we have come close to  having them released but their captors fear a trap in which they will be captured in the handover process. ‘One girl has what I assume is a broken wrist as they demonstrate to me how she holds her hand. I have been told that others are sick and in need of medical attention.’ A military source said: ‘This has been a race against time from the minute they were captured. As soon as the girls left Nigerian soil it was always going to be more difficult. ‘The government made no attempt at a rescue until a month after they were taken. Now the situation gets more serious by the day. ‘Any sort of attempt to get to them would have to be cleared by the  governments of the other nations.’ The heavily armed terror group have moved the girls to a 'safe location' Scathing condemnations of Nigeria’s failure to address the menace of Boko Haram, ever since a proposed peace deal failed last August – leading to the extension of a state of emergency in three northern states – continued worldwide last week. US Senator Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Nigeria had been ‘tragically and unacceptably slow’ to begin a search. Others say the clock really being watched by Nigerian politicians is not the six weeks and counting since the kidnap but the 11 months to the country’s elections. Opposition politician Nuhu Ribadu has accused the government of  ‘total failure’.","Terror group Boko Haram has released a new video of the kidnapped girls .

Helicopters have hoisted three huge mirrors . into position some 450 metres above the town at the top of the valley. Known as heliostats, they have been designed to trace the movement of the sun and reflect the light directly onto Rjukan's main square. Helicopters have hoisted three huge mirrors into position 450 metres above the town . Genius: The sun beams down onto the mirrors which reflect the light onto the town of Rjukan in the valley below . The idea is not new. It was first suggested in Rjukan 100 years ago by a worker at the nearby hydroelectric plant.Martin Andersen drew up the plans and won funding of about 5million kroner (£522,700) for the project. Steinar . Bergsland, the town's mayor, told The Telegraph: 'It is really special . to stand in the light down on the square and feel the heat. This is for the pale little children of Rjukan.' Let there be light: The Norwegian town of Rjukan will receive its first ever rays of winter sunshine this year after locals set up giant mirrors to bounce light onto the town square . Clever: People gather in front of the town hall in sunlight which has been reflected by giant mirrors . Norwegian engineer and industrialist Sam Eyde was concerned his workers . weren't getting enough sunshine during the winter months.He . considered the mirror idea but felt they lacked the technology to make . it work so opted instead for the construction of a cable car. In 2006, a similar project was successfully set up in the village of Viganella in northern Italy which had suffered from exactly the same problem. A delegation from visited Viganella to see how their mirror had transformed people's lives, and was suitably impressed. In 2006, a similar project was set up in the village of Viganella in northern Italy which suffered from the same problem (left) and a (right) Rjukan on the map in Norway . After five years of debate, Rjukan town council finally agreed to to build the mirrors. They are controlled by a computer to follow the path of then sun, adjusting to the best angle to ensure the town square is bathed in light. Solar panels will power equipment to automatically wash the mirrors and move them into position. Designers hope the sunshine will revitalise the town during the winter months. A message on the Rjukan tourist website states: 'The square will become a sunny meeting place in a town otherwise in shadow.'","Industrial town of Rjukan gets no sunshine between September and March .

"The Colorado father who was found safe in Pueblo Tuesday, five days after he went missing during a Denver Broncos game, is now staying with friends and catching up on his sleep, it was revealed today. At around 10.50pm Eastern time, the Denver Police Department tweeted that 53-year-old Paul Kitterman had been found alive more than 110 miles south of Denver in the City of Pueblo, and that no foul play is suspected. Reached by phone, Kitterman's father, Allen, told MailOnline: 'He's back home with his friends. We have not spoken to him but we are glad he's OK. 'We are trying to let him sleep, he's catching up on his sleep. I appreciate your concern.' Pueblo Police said they found Kitterman coherent outside a Kmart store near Highway 50 and Elizabeth Street after a citizen spotted him, Fox Denver reports. Scroll down for videos . FOUND: Paul Kitterman (second left) was last seen on Thursday when he disappeared during halftime at the Broncos game. Denver Police announced Tuesday night that he had been found alive and unharmed in Pueblo, Colorado. Also pictured are his stepson Jarod (far right), friend Tia Bakke (second right) and her boyfriend Jay Yust (left) The above map shows the distance between Broncos Stadium, where Kitterman went missing on Thursday, and Pueblo, Colorado where he was found unharmed five days later . He reportedly told police that he wanted to escape to some place warm. Police there said he appeared to be in good health, and has been put up in a hotel to await the arrival of his grown stepson, whom he had left alone during halftime at Mile High Stadium five days earlier. According to police, they got a call from a family friend Tuesday saying they had picked up Kitterman at a Salvation Army and took him to a Rodeway Inn in Pueblo, but by the time officers arrived at the motel the man was gone. Soon after, police received a call from the owner of Benfatti Furniture who spotted Kitterman and recognized him as the missing man from news reports. The 53-year-old was picked up next to a Kmart store near the Pueblo Mall. Kitterman, who had no car and no cellphone on him, revealed that he walked and hitchhiked from Denver to Pueblo located 112 miles away because 'he'd had his fill of football,' reported USA Today. The father also allegedly told police that he enjoyed taking walks, reported the station KOAA. According to police in Pueblo, the divorced construction worker was surprised to learn that his disappearance has made national headlines. Kitterman, who had been described by his family as someone who is not comfortable with technology, told officers that he had not seen any television since he took off from the stadium. Earlier in the day Tuesday, Kitterman's family had a scare when police found the body of a middle-aged man near train tracks in the vicinity of the football stadium, but it was quickly determined that it was not the missing dad. Paul Kitterman's family have released a statement on Facebook thanking everyone for offering them support and asking the public and the media to respect their privacy. 'The family is happy to report Paul has been found and they are now with him and he is safe,' read the status update posted Tuesday night. Denver Police Sgt. Steve Warneke said that no criminal charges are expected. 'All we were trying to do was make sure he was unharmed, and he was,' Warneke said. 'So at that point, we're finished."" Police referred all other questions to Kitterman's family. Kitterman was last seen on Thursday when his stepson left him at halftime to use the restroom. On Monday night, Denver police revealed that a witness saw Kitterman inside the stadium during the third quarter, but it remains unknown where the man went after the game. Jarod Tonneson, Kitterman’s stepson, as well as his friends, have publicly criticized  investigators for allegedly not doing enough to locate the missing man. 'I think they should take us more seriously,' Tonneson said during an interview on Fox News Tuesday morning. Tia Bakke, Kitterman's friend who took him to the fateful game on Thursday, told MailOnline Monday: 'He's now been missing for four days and we have had absolutely no leads whatsoever. But police don't consider it a priority. 'They say he is an adult and there is no sign of foul play so there is nothing much they can do,' she added. 'I am trying to maintain a positive, hopeful attitude, but I am very, very worried.' Kitterman, who is unmarried and lives alone in Kremmling, was at his first ever professional football game when he vanished. Bakke and her boyfriend Jay Yust - for whom Kitterman has worked for the last 10 years - had invited him last-minute to go to Thursday's crunch AFC West face-off against the San Diego Chargers along with his 21-year-old stepson, Jarod Tonneson. In their haste, Kitterman forgot his cellphone, took no credit cards and very little cash. Still, Kitterman had memorized his friends' phone numbers and would have found ways to reach out if he wanted to leave. 'We are regulars, we are not season ticket holders, but this was the fourth Broncos game we have been to this season, and we have taken other friends with us before,' said Bakke. 'But Paul had never been to a game.' The friends couldn't get seats together so Bakke and Yust sat in one section of the Sports Authority Field at Mile High while Kitterman and his son went to another, section number 230. Safe and well - but where was he? Denver Police said that no foul play was suspected in Kitterman's disappearance. They referred all further questions to the man's family . Father and son: Jarod Tonneson (left) and Paul went with Tia Bakke and her boyfriend for their first Broncos game on Thursday . The foursome met up at halftime when the Broncos were leading 14-7 — but that is the last time that Kitterman, who works on Yust's MY Ranch in Kremmling, Colorado, was seen. 'He was super-excited about the game. It was the first time he had been and the Broncos were ahead and playing well,' Bakke, 24, told MailOnline. 'Jarod needed to use the restroom and we left Paul waiting outside for him - it couldn't have been more than 10 feet from where we had been standing.' But when Jarod came out, his father was nowhere to be found so he went back to his seat in the south bleachers to watch the second half of the game, assuming he would soon rejoin him. When the game ended in a 35-21 Bronco victory around 9.30 pm, Bakke called Tonneson telling him she and her 30-year-old boyfriend were waiting at Gate 8 ready for the two-hour drive back to Kremmling. 'He said he was waiting for Paul and asked me if he was with us, I said ""no, I thought he was with you.""' Mystery: Kitterman - pictured with Jarod at the game - did not have his cell phone or his credit cards with him when he vanished, Bakke said . For nearly three frantic hours the trio searched the 13-year-old, 76,000-capacity stadium with no luck. They called the police, local hospitals, even jails and detox facilities in the hope that someone could give them a lead. Tonneson told Denver's Fox affiliate, KDVR-TV he and his friends had looked in 'parking lots, trees, bushes, anywhere we could think of'. Eventually they left for the long journey home, hoping against hope that Paul would be waiting for them when they returned to Kremmling. Bakke called the frustrating days following the game 'the longest, most miserable days of her life'. According to his son, Paul had four or five beers in the course of a four-hour span, not enough to become disoriented. Tia Bakke told MailOnline that Kitterman has worked for her boyfriend for nearly a decade and has always been extremely reliable. 'Paul is the most trustworthy person you could ever wish to meet,' she said. 'He would hate the fuss that is growing up around his disappearance. Paul is just not the type of person who would do something like this for attention. 'He would never deliberately let anyone worry about him, that is just not who he is,' she added. 'He never wants stress or heartache or anything like that. He is the type of person that if you are having a bad day will do anything he can to be there for you. Back home: Bakke told MailOnline that Kitterman said that it was uncharacteristic of him to disappear. She said he's 'extremely reliable. Paul is the most trustworthy person you could ever wish to meet' Farm hand: Kitterman worked at a ranch owned by the friends he went to the game with.

"Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings has revealed that a dog belonging to Ebola patient Nina Pham is not expected to be put down. Miss Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas was one of the team of medical staff who treated Thomas Duncan at the Dallas hospital before he died from the dreaded virus last week. Speaking to USA Today, Rawlings said 'This was a new twist. The dog's very important to the patient and we want it to be safe.' Scroll down for video . Tragic: Nina Pham, 26, is fighting for her life after contracting Ebola from Thomas Eric Duncan. Here she is pictured with her beloved King Charles Spaniel who is not expected to be destroyed but has been quarantined . Caution: A member of the CG Environmental HazMat team disinfects the entrance to the residence of a health worker at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who has contracted Ebola in Dallas on Sunday . The dog is going to be transported out of the apartment, Rawlings told the newspaper. Miss Pham, who works at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital, caught the virus from Thomas Duncan - the first Ebola sufferer to have been diagnosed in the U.S. Rawlings expressed similar concerns about the dog to The Wall Street Journal, saying:'This dog is an important part of the family to our health care worker. We want to make sure the dog is in a safe place.' 'We'll assist with [getting the dog out],' CG Environmental employee Brad Smith told USA Today. 'We have the [personal protection equipment] that needs to be worn.' There was a brief but intense battle last week between health officials and protesters over the life of Excalibur, a light brown mixed breed dog belonging to a Spanish nursing assistant, Teresa Romero, and her husband. Romero was diagnosed with the deadly virus Monday, contracted when she treated a victim who came from Sierra Leone. Miss Pham, from Fort Worth, Texas was one of the team of medical staff who treated Thomas Duncan at the Dallas hospital before he died from the dreaded virus last week . A hazmat crew cleans outside the apartment. The health care worker was one that cared for patient Thomas Eric Duncan the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and to pass away . Fight for survival: Excalibur, the dog of the Spanish Ebola patient, is seen in this photograph from last week. The dog was euthanized, despite uncertainty over whether the dog was also infected or risked spreading the disease . Officials from Madrid's regional government got a court order Tuesday to euthanize the pet, despite uncertainty over whether the dog was also infected or risked spreading the disease to humans. By that afternoon, 30 to 40 animal rights activists had taken up positions outside Romero's apartment complex, determined to prevent officials from entering. Then Romero's quarantined husband, Javier, recruited a veterinarian who hosts a popular radio talk show in a bid to spare his dog's life. 'I'm in the hospital and I'm making a call to all people to help me save my dog Excalibur because they want to kill him just like that, without following any procedure,' Mr Romero said in a video appeal from his hospital room. Within hours, the cause went viral. On Twitter, the hashtag (hash)SalvemosaExcalibur - 'Let's Save Excalibur' - was tweeted nearly 400,000 times in 24 hours, making it the social networking site's second most popular meme worldwide. Protest: A dog was photographed with protesters in Spain on Saturday over Excalibur's death . In an equally short time, a petition set up on the Change.org website demanding the dog's life be saved garnered more than 380,000 signatures, and a second petition gathered 70,000 more. But after refusing the say when the dog would be taken away, the Madrid regional government announced Wednesday evening that it had euthanized the pet. Excalibur was 'sedated beforehand to avoid suffering,' Madrid's regional health agency said in a statement. The corpse was then 'put into a sealed biosecurity device and transferred for incineration at an authorized disposal facility,' the statement said. The health agency said that the dog was killed because it posed a risk of transmitting the disease to humans. There is no documented case of Ebola spreading to people from dogs. But at least one major study suggests dogs can get the disease without showing symptoms. Experts say they are uncertain of what risk that poses to humans. Spanish authorities, though, were taking no chances. When the white veterinary van carrying Excalibur's body left the apartment complex Wednesday, black plastic covered the outside of the windows. Dozens of protesters stood in front of it and forced it to stop, briefly. Then baton-wielding police officers beat back the crowd and the van drove away.","Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings has revealed that a dog belonging to Ebola patient Nina Pham, 26, is not expected to be put down .

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has criticised energy companies for imposing huge price rises that will hammer struggling families. Justin Welby said power giants had a ‘massive’ moral duty beyond squeezing customers for maximum profit, and challenged the firms to justify their huge increases in bills. The Archbishop, himself a former oil executive, said he understood the anger over apparently ‘inexplicable’ rises and called on the companies ‘to behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity’. Sympathy: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said he understood anger over 'inexplicable' rises . He hit out after British Gas announced a 9.2 per cent hike, despite parent company Centrica recording a £2.7 billion profit last year. Other suppliers are expected to follow suit. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Britain’s most senior cleric said that rises which would add an average £123 a year to bills were ‘a huge moral issue’ for energy firms. Archbishop Welby’s comments will heap pressure on the Government to get tougher on the industry. Energy prices have become a major political issue, with Labour accusing the Government of failing to tackle  ‘rip-off’ companies, while Ministers have said consumers should switch to better deals and even wear jumpers to keep warm. The Archbishop called on energy companies to be ‘conscious of their social obligations’ and said: ‘The impact on people, particularly on low incomes, is going to be really severe in this, and the companies have to justify fully what they are doing. ‘I do understand when people feel that this is inexplicable, and I can understand people being angry about it, because having spent years on a low income as a clergyman I know what it  is like when your household budget is blown apart by a significant extra fuel bill and your anxiety levels become very high. That is the reality of it.’ Price rise: Profits at British Gas rose 11 per cent last year . The issue of fuel prices has shot to the top of the political agenda since Labour leader Ed Miliband promised to freeze bills for 20 months if he won the next Election, a pledged branded a ‘con’ by David Cameron. Shadow Energy Secretary Caroline Flint welcomed the Archbishop’s comments, saying: ‘The chorus of voices telling this Government to act on spiralling energy bills is deafening.’ Archbishop Welby said the energy companies had a moral obligation to set prices fairly. He said: ‘They have control because they sell something everyone has to buy. We have no choice about buying it. ‘With that amount of power comes huge responsibility to serve society. It is not like some other sectors of business where people can walk away from you if they don’t want to buy your product and you are entitled to seek to maximise your profit. ‘The social licence to operate of the energy companies is something they have to take very, very seriously indeed.’ Archbishop Welby added that he was concerned that fuel poverty was ‘a very severe issue... because real incomes are flat or declining and the cost of energy has gone up. It ties in with the food banks and the debt. They are all part of the reality of life for many people today.’ ‘The chorus of voices telling this Government to act on spiralling energy bills is deafening.’ -Shadow Energy Secretary Caroline Flint . Fuel poverty is defined as when ten per cent or more of a household’s disposable income is spent on adequate heating. Following the Archbishop’s comments, The Mail on Sunday discovered that The Church of England itself invests heavily in energy firms. Accounts show the Church owns more than £7 million worth of shares in Centrica and about £6 million in SSE. The Church says it uses its investments for ‘active engagement’ with companies and their boards to exert a positive influence. British Gas’s price rise announced last week follows an 8.2 per cent increase by SSE. Other ‘Big Six’ suppliers are likely to follow. The hike dismayed campaigners, who said it was a ‘big, nasty’ shock for families who would have to choose between eating and heating this winter. But the suppliers all say they have to put up bills in the face of rising costs. SSE summed up the position, saying: ‘We regret having to put our prices, but the cost of supplying energy is going up: buying it, delivering it to homes and the cost of government taxes all cost more than last year and are outside our direct control.’ Archbishop Welby, who worked for French firm Elf Aquitaine and London-based Enterprise Oil before becoming a vicar in Coventry, said he did not have enough evidence to know if the suppliers were too quick to pass on wholesale rises, but slow to pass on price falls. Profits at British Gas rose 11 per cent last year to £606 million, and managing director Chris Weston is expected to net £2 million in share bonuses this year on top of a £595,000 salary. Archbishop Welby pays the energy bills for his Lambeth Palace flat out of his annual £74,000 stipend, but most clergy receive less than £25,000 a year. 'Wrong place': Energy minister Greg Barker said some planners have been 'too insensitive' 'Cannot be at any place at any price': Minister Greg Barker . Wind farms have scarred  the British landscape and turned the public against the renewable energy agenda, an Energy Minister has conceded. Greg Barker made the admission as he promised that future projects would be located off-shore. ‘We put certain projects in the wrong place,’ the Energy and Climate Change Minister said. ‘Some planners have been too insensitive to the impact on the landscape and it has turned public opinion against the wider renewable agenda. We are very clear about the need to limit the impact on the countryside and landscape. It is quite clear the expansion of the  on-shore wind rush is over.’ Mr Barker’s comments come amid growing political tension over rising household energy bills and a week after it was revealed that a record number of on-shore wind farms have been approved for construction this year. Between January and August, 188 were granted planning permission – a 49 per cent increase on the  same period in 2012. As energy companies continue to lodge applications to take advantage of generous green subsidies, Mr Barker said Britain was on course to meet a target that 20 per cent of electricity must come from sustainable sources by 2020. But the Minister added that he would write to every council, warning they must ban turbines from areas of outstanding natural beauty. He said: ‘There’s enough wind projects in the system now so we don’t need to see any more on-shore expansion. The big area for expansion is off-shore, where there is scope for larger projects. ‘With those projects in the system or under consideration in the planning process at the moment, it means we have enough to get to our 2020 targets. ‘But it cannot be at any place and at any price.’","Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby criticised energy companies .

"For a man who has made billions from encouraging the world to share, it was a very private event. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg married his girlfriend of nine years on Saturday – in a ceremony so secret that even the guests did not know they would be attending a wedding. They turned up at Zuckerberg’s £4.5million home in Palo Alto, California, thinking they were there to celebrate Priscilla Chan’s graduation from her degree in paediatrics. True love: Priscilla Chan, the new Mrs Mark Zuckerberg, was walked down the aisle last Saturday by the couple's dog Beast, a Hungarian sheepdog. The couple also wrote their own vows . Social media: Priscilla Chan (left) and Mark Zuckerberg  interact regularly on Facebook, and Mark announced their wedding on his personal timeline . Married: The couple have been together for nine years, but did not reveal their engagement . But instead they were greeted by Zuckerberg – who famously always wears jeans and hoodies – in a navy suit and tie, and his bride in a wedding dress. Zuckerberg, 28, and Chan, 27, spent four months planning the wedding, but had not publicly revealed they were engaged. The only announcement came after the event – and, of course, appeared on Zuckerberg’s Facebook page, where he posted a picture of himself and his new wife and changed his relationship status to ‘married’. The day before the wedding, Facebook floated on the stock market and his fortune rose to £12billion. But despite this, Zuckerberg’s nuptials remained relatively modest, with £7.50 meals of Mexican food from his favourite local restaurant for the guests, who numbered fewer than 100. Performer: Billie Joe Armstrong, the lead singer for Green Day, arrived with his wife Adrienne in town and carrying a Gibson guitar. He provided entertainment for the newlyweds, playing 'My Last Night on Earth' Dessert was a selection of chocolate mice at £2 each, and the venue was the back garden of his five-bedroom home. It is not known whether the couple, who met at Harvard, signed a prenuptial agreement to protect Zuckerberg’s fortune in the event of a break-up. If they did not, California divorce law works under the principle of ‘community property’, where anything earned by either party during the marriage is divided 50-50. Ms Chan graduated from medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, on Monday, the same day Mr Zuckerberg turned 28. The couple have been together for more than nine years and a source at the wedding said Mr Zuckerberg designed the ring featuring 'a very simple ruby.' The guests all thought they were coming to celebrate Ms Chan's graduation but were told after they arrived that the event was in fact a wedding. 'Everybody was shocked,' the source said. Couple: Ms Chan and Mr Zuckerberg met when they studied at Harvard and have been together ever since . Guests: Those invited thought they were attending a party to celebrate Ms Chan's graduation . Arrival: Guests were pictured turning up at the Palo Alto home on Saturday afternoon . Mr Zuckerberg invited Green Day lead signer Billie Joe Armstrong to entertain his wedding guests and celebrate the ceremony. A video TMZ filmed outside Mr Zuckerberg's home reveals that he played 'Last Night on Earth.' Mr Armstrong told guests he wrote the song for his own wife. In addition to the live performance by Mr Armstrong, TMZ says guests partied to Flo Rida, Bon Jovi and Janet Jackson. However, the Facebook family favorite appeared to be Michael Jackson. Neighbors reported hearing the King of Pop more than any other artist. According to a source the timing was not tied to the IPO, since the date the company planned to go public was a 'moving target'. Private: Mr Zuckerberg is known to be secretive about his personal life despite running a social network . Drinks: The Facebook founder ordered large amounts of alcohol in anticipation of the party . Despite his strong advocacy of online openness and sharing, and scant regard for web users' desire for privacy, Mr Zuckerberg has long been secretive about his own personal life. It was not even widely known that the Facebook founder was engaged to Ms Chan, despite the length of their relationship. Even after Friday's IPO, Mr Zuckerberg remains Facebook's single largest shareholder, with 503.6million shares. And he controls the company with 56 per cent of its voting stock. The site, which was born in a dorm room eight years ago, has grown into a worldwide network of almost a billion people. Flotation: Mr Zuckerberg opened trading on the Nasdaq last Friday, the day of Facebook's IPO . Mr Zuckerberg founded Facebook at Harvard in 2004, in a saga which would later become the basis for Oscar-winning film The Social Network. He was named as Time's Person of the Year in 2010, aged just 26. Mr Zuckerberg grew up in Dobbs Ferry, New York. Despite the hype over Friday's initial public offering, the share price fell flat by closing bell, finishing at only 23 cents more than its expected opening price. Millions of new investors will be wary come next week amid fears as the IPO failed to match expectations. However, the slightly underwhelming impact of the big day will do little to dent Mr Zuckerberg's mood, considering that he is believed to have landed nearly $20billion from the deal. He is not alone in striking it rich from the IPO - other Facebook investors to profit include co-founder Eduardo Saverin and U2 frontman Bono.","Guests were told party was meant to celebrate Chan's graduation .

"Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and was beatified by the Vatican in 2003 . Researchers are calling into question the saintly image of Mother Teresa after carrying out research into her life. Born Agnes Gonxha in Albania, she founded the Missionaries of Charity and spent much of her life in Calcutta, caring for the sick and poor. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and was beatified by the Vatican in 2003, six years after her death - one miracle away from sainthood. But a number of critics have questioned how much of the image is justified. Writing in journal Studies in Religion/Sciences, Serge Larivie and Genevieve Chenard, say her hallowed reputation does not stand up to scrutiny. Prof Larivie said: 'While looking for documentation on the phenomenon of altruism for a seminar on ethics, one of us stumbled upon the life and work of one of Catholic Church's most celebrated woman and now part of our collective imagination - Mother Teresa. 'The description was so ecstatic that it piqued our curiosity and pushed us to research further.' After studying nearly 300 documents on her life, they concluded that a number of issues surrounded the nun were not taken into account by the Vatican. These included 'her rather dubious way of caring for the sick, her questionable political contacts, her suspicious management of the enormous sums of money she received, and her overly dogmatic views regarding, in particular, abortion, contraception, and divorce.' At the time of her death, Mother Teresa had opened 517 missions welcoming the poor and sick in more than 100 countries. But these missions have been described as 'homes for the dying' by doctors visiting several of these establishments in Calcutta. Doctors observed a significant lack of hygiene, even unfit conditions, as well as a shortage of actual care, inadequate food, and no painkillers. But the authors say the problem is not a lack of money, as the foundation created by Mother Teresa has raised hundred of millions of pounds. Sisters of the Missions of Charity attend the state funeral for Mother Teresa in Calcutta but critics have sparked controversy claiming her care of the sick was 'dubious' They also say that following numerous natural disasters in India she offered prayers and medallions of the Virgin Mary but no direct or monetary aid. But she accepted the Legion of Honour and a grant from the Duvalier dictatorship in Haiti, said prof Larivee, and although millions of dollars were transferred to the various bank accounts, most of the accounts were kept secret. Dr Larivie says: 'Given the parsimonious management of Mother Teresa's works, one may ask where the millions of dollars for the poorest of the poor have gone?' He says that her image may have been built upon a meeting in 1968 with the BBC's Malcom Muggeridge, an anti-abortion journalist who shared her right-wing Catholic values. It was his promotion of her which led to her fame, they say. But whether or not her image is deserved, the authors accept that there are many positives to her reputation. Dr Larivie said: 'If the extraordinary image of Mother Teresa conveyed in the collective imagination has encouraged humanitarian initiatives that are genuinely engaged with those crushed by poverty, we can only rejoice. 'It is likely that she has inspired many humanitarian workers whose actions have truly relieved the suffering of the destitute and addressed the causes of poverty and isolation without being extolled by the media. 'Nevertheless, the media coverage of Mother Teresa could have been a little more rigorous.'","Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity and spent much of her life caring for the sick and poor in Calcutta .
But researchers are questioning whether her image is justified ."
"Holder says drone strikes in the U.S. on American citizens are hypothetically possible, but only in extreme circumstances . Attorney General Eric Holder says the U.S. Government could kill Americans on their home soil using drone strikes. He did not rule out potential scenarios where a drone could target an American in the U.S., but said it has not happened so far and only in the most extreme of circumstances could he ever see it being considered. His comments came in testimony yesterday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican, Texas, asked Holder whether he believed it would be constitutional to target an American terror suspect who was simply 'sitting at a cafe' . 'No,' Holder replied, calling the use of domestic drone strikes 'entirely hypothetical' and adding that the government has no intention of carrying out drone strikes against its own citizens. His comments . come in the wake of Senator Rand Paul demanding that he or the . president or issue a statement assuring the unmanned aircraft would not . be used in the United States to kill American terrorism suspects as part . of his 13 hour filibuster blocking the nomination of John Brennan as . director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Paul . started just before noon Wednesday by demanding the president or . Attorney General Eric Holder issue a statement assuring the unmanned . aircraft would not be used in the United States to kill terrorism . suspects who are U.S. citizens. He wasn't picky about the format, saying at one point he'd be happy with a telegram or a Tweet. The Obama administration has said the . federal government has not conducted such operations inside U.S. borders and has no intention of doing so. Paul said he recognized that he can't . stop Brennan from being confirmed. But the nomination was the right . vehicle for a debate over what the Obama White House believes are the . limits of the federal government's ability to conduct lethal operations . against suspected terrorists, he said. Scroll down for video . The Attorney General's comments came after Senator Rand Paul made a 13 hour filibuster against John Brennan being appointed director of the CIA . Paul, 50, received intermittent . support early on from several other conservative senators holding . similar views, plus Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. He spoke . almost continuously for five hours before Majority Leader Harry Reid . tried but failed to move to a vote on Brennan. Paul snacked on candy at the dinner . hour while continuing to speak. At one point, Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., . who walks haltingly with a cane because of a stroke, delivered a . canister of hot tea and an apple to Paul's desk, but a doorkeeper . removed them. Rep. Louie Gohmert, a conservative from Texas, stood off . to the side of the Senate floor in a show of support. Other well-wishers . with privileges to be on the floor shook his hand when he temporarily . turned the speaking over to his colleagues. Held up: Democratic leaders had hoped to hold a final vote by the full Senate to confirm Brennan (pictured) on Wednesday . Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, read Twitter . messages from people eager to 'Stand With Rand.' The Twitterverse, said . Cruz, is 'blowing up.' And as the night went on, Cruz spoke for longer . periods as Paul leaned against a desk across the floor. Cruz, an . insurgent Republican with strong tea party backing, read passages from . Shakespeare's 'Henry V' and lines from the 1970 movie 'Patton,' starring . George C. Scott. Dressed in a dark suit, white shirt . and red tie, Paul read from notebooks filled with articles about the . expanded use of the unmanned weapons that have become the centerpiece of . the Obama administration's campaign against al-Qaida suspects. As he . moved about the Senate floor, aides brought him glasses of water, which . he barely touched. Senate rules say a senator has to remain on the floor . to continue to hold it, even though he can yield to another senator for . a question. Drones, unarmed craft that carry missiles, are a key weapon in the U.S. War on Terror . 'No president has the right to say he is judge, jury and executioner,' Paul said. Not all Republicans were so . enthusiastic about Paul's performance. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said . the prospect of drones being used to kill people in the United States . was 'ridiculous' and called the debate 'paranoia between libertarians . and the hard left that is unjustified.' Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., the . chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, echoed Graham. He said it . is unconstitutional for the U.S. military or intelligence agencies to . conduct lethal counterterrorism operations in the United States against . U.S. citizens. Suggesting they can or might, Rogers said, 'provokes . needless fear and detracts attention from the real threats facing the . country.' The President, if the circumstances arose, could theoretically launch a drone strike on a U.S. citizen on American soil . Later in the evening Paul, who is the . son of former Texas congressman and libertarian leader Ron Paul, offered . to allow a vote on Brennan if the Senate would vote on his resolution . stating that the use of the unmanned, armed aircraft on U.S. soil . against American citizens violates the Constitution. Democrats rejected . the offer. Reid, D-Nev., said he planned to file a . motion to bring debate over Brennan's nomination to an end, if not on . Thursday, then Friday or next week. Reid had pushed for a confirmation . vote Wednesday. Technically, the Senate had not even started the debate . on Brennan's nomination before Paul took control of the floor almost . immediately after Republicans successfully blocked a vote on a federal . appeals court nominee. Along with Cruz and Wyden, Republican . Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Marco Rubio of Florida . joined Paul briefly three hours into the debate but turned it back to . him. Wyden has long pressed for greater oversight of the use of drones. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., appeared later in the evening to trade . questions with Paul. The record for the longest individual . speech on the Senate floor belongs to former Sen. Strom Thurmond of . South Carolina, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the . Civil Rights Act of 1957. Holder came close to making the . statement Paul wanted earlier in the day during an exchange with Cruz at . a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, according to Paul. Never-ending: Paul appears on a television screen in an office at the U.S. Capitol as he spoke for more than 13 hours on the Senate floor in opposition to Brennan's nomination . Cruz asked Holder if the Constitution . allowed the federal government to kill a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil who . doesn't pose an imminent threat. Holder said the situation was . hypothetical, but he did not think that in that situation the use of a . drone or lethal force would be appropriate. Cruz criticized Holder for . not simply saying 'no' in response. In a letter sent Tuesday to Paul, Brennan said the CIA does not have authority to conduct lethal operations inside the U.S. Holder told Paul in a March 4 letter . that the federal government has not conducted such operations and has no . intention of doing so. But Holder also wrote that he supposed it was . possible under an 'extraordinary circumstance' that the president would . have no choice but to authorize the military to use lethal force inside . U.S. borders. Holder cited the attacks at Pearl Harbor and on Sept. 11, . 2001, as examples. Paul said he did not dispute that the . president has the authority to take swift and lethal action against an . enemy that carried out a significant attack against the United States. But Paul said he was 'alarmed' at how difficult it has been to get the . administration to clearly define what qualifies as a legitimate target . of a drone strike. Brennan's nomination won approval . Tuesday by the Senate Intelligence Committee after the White House broke . a lengthy impasse by agreeing to give lawmakers access to top-secret . legal opinions justifying the use of lethal drone strikes against . al-Qaida suspects overseas. If confirmed, Brennan would replace . Michael Morell, the CIA's deputy director who has been acting director . since David Petraeus resigned in November after acknowledging an affair . with his biographer. Brennan currently serves as Obama's . top counterterrorism adviser in the White House. He was nominated for . the CIA post by the president in early January and the Intelligence .

"A Dallas County sheriff's deputy remains hospitalized today with Ebola symptoms, more than a week after he went unprotected into the apartment of 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan. Sgt Michael Monnig went on Wednesday to an urgent-care facility in Frisco, Texas with his wife, after complaining of stomach problems. The deputy presented at the clinic a week after he visited the Dallas home where Duncan was staying when he developed Ebola symptoms. Sgt Monnig was at the home to deliver a quarantine order to family members. Neither Sgt Monnig, nor the other two health officials, Zachary Thompson and Christopher Perkins with him, were wearing protective clothing or masks despite being in the apartment as cleaning crews were going about their work in full protective gear. Sgt Monning was given an Ebola test at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, though results usually take 48 hours and aren't due back until Friday night. A possible Ebola patient, believed to be Dallas County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Monnig, is brought to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday in Dallas, Texas . The sheriff's deputy arrives at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital today via ambulance after attending an urgent-care clinic with symptoms . Sgt Monnig walked into Texas Presbyterian Hosptial today accompanied by medics in hazmat suits . Sgt Monnig, pictured here with his family, went to an urgent-care facility in Frisco, Texas on Wednesday with Ebola-like symptoms. His family said he was simply taking precautions . 'It was pretty scary': Monnig's wife recalled the fear she had after learning her husband was in the apartment where Duncan took ill and likely relived that fear on Wednesday . Sgt Monnig's son, Logan Monnig, told CBS that his father had woken up with 'stomach issues' and had gone to the clinic as a precaution. Logan said family were told by the CDC that their father was not at risk of the virus, as he had only been in the apartment for 30 minutes and had not come in contact with bodily fluids. 'We are not expecting him to' test positive for Ebola, said Logan. The day after going into the apartment, Sgt Monnig and his fellow officers were told to bag up the clothes they'd been wearing. Their police cars were also taken out of commission. 'That starts putting question marks in your mind,' Monnig told WFAA in an October 3 report. 'You know when you go home and then the next day you start hearing that equipment is being quarantined or asked to be bagged up, that you had on or were driving. 'Then your question is, ""well, what about me?"" And so those were the questions that were raised.' Now the question is: Why wasn't Monnig warned before entering the home completely without protection? 'There should be some kind of protocols as far as what kind of a response we're going to have and what kind of safety equipment we're going to have,' Christopher Dyer, president of the Dallas County Sheriff's Association, said in the WFAA interview. 'Those kinds of things didn't happen.' Monnig's wife Lisa echoed his sentiment. 'It was pretty scary,' Lisa Monnig said about the day her husband entered the apartment. 'I was awake until he got home that night.' No doubt Monnig is now feeling that pit in her stomach again as she and her family are forced to wait out the next two days it will take to determine whether Monnig managed to catch the dreaded virus. Mr Duncan, 42, died on Wednesday morning at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, two weeks after developing symptoms of the virus. Sgt Monnig  told medics at the Frisco clinic today that he had been in contact with first victim Mr Duncan and had not been wearing protective clothing. A firefighter removes red tape from a vehicle parked outside a CareNow clinic in Frisco, Texas on Wednesday. Frisco Fire Chief Mark Piland says the deputy is being treated 'out of an abundance of caution' A medical team in hazmat suits along with law enforcement rushed to the scene at a CareNow clinic in Frisco, Texas on Wednesday after a man turned up with Ebola-like symptoms . The person, reportedly a Dallas County sheriff's deputy, was exhibiting Ebola symptoms today and claimed to have had contact with patient Thomas Duncan, who died from the virus on Wednesday morning . An ambulance, driven by a firefighter-paramedic wearing a hazmat suit, carries an individual, believed to be a Dallas County sheriff's deputy, with Ebola symptoms to a hospital in Frisco, Texas on Wednesday afternoon after the person turned up at an urgent care clinic . The CareNow clinic was immediately placed in lock-down because Monnig was exhibiting signs of the deadly virus - including feeling sick and appearing flushed with a fever. The CDC told MailOnline today that the person is not one of the 48 contacts being monitored, and there is no indication of any direct contact with the initial patient, Mr Duncan. None of the 48 individuals with verified or possible contact with the patient has shown symptoms, the CDC said today. A father who had taken his teenage son to the clinic to get a flu shot on Wednesday told WFAA that the man entered the clinic with his wife, appeared flushed and was hunched over. Chuck Moreno said that he and his son had self-quarantined in an exam room, put on surgical masks and sprayed themselves with disinfectant. Sgt Monnig answered yes in a screening questionnaire to a question about travel to West Africa and is said to have contact with Duncan, referred to as  ‘patient zero’. The Frisco patient was rushed to Texas Health Presbyterian Hosptial by ambulance after turning up at the urgent care clinic on Main Street. Medics at the clinic called 911 at around 12.30pm to request an ambulance for the patient. A team in hazmat suits and face masks transported the law enforcement officer. A hospital spokesman said: 'Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas can confirm today that a patient has been admitted to the Emergency Room after reporting possible exposure to the Ebola virus. 'Right now, there are more questions than answers about this case. Our professional staff of nurses and doctors is prepared to examine the patient, discuss any findings with appropriate agencies and officials. A second person is exhibiting Ebola symptoms in Texas today and claimed to have had contact with Thomas Duncan who died from Ebola today . A sign on the door of the apartment where Thomas Eric Duncan stayed with family warns that the unit has been quarantined by the commissioner of health on Wednesday . Where it began: Neither Sgt Monnig, nor the other two health officials, Zachary Thompson (left) and Christopher Perkins (right) with him, were wearing protective clothing or masks. The two other men are seen here leaving the apartment where Patient Zero stayed while ill. Neither Thompson nor Perkins have reported any worrisome symptoms . 'We are on alert with precautions and systems in place. At the same time, we are caring for routine cases which are completely separate in operations.' The clinic was keeping everyone at the center until they are checked out by the CDC - it is unknown how many people were exposed to the patient. All those at the clinic will be transferred to a hospital but it is unclear which medical facility. While no doubt in a fearful and nearvous state now, Mr. Monnig's career has often hinged largely on his physical toughness, even more so than most cops. The large-framed Monnig once worked as a sort of human punching bag for incoming Dallas County police recruits who learned how to use batons by beating Monnig. At least that was his job until 2008, when Monnig was temporarily terminated from the police force after getting seriously injured during one of his brutal training sessions. He was unable to work in active duty and the force was apparently not interested in giving him a desk job. Concerned son: Monnig's son Logan (pictured) spoke to reporters outside the family home not long after his father checked himself in with doctors Wednesday. Logan Monnig said he and his family are worried about Mr. Monnig but said 'we are not expecting him to' test positive for Ebola . A patient attended CareNow clinic in Frisco, Texas today and was rushed to a nearby hospital after presenting with Ebola symptoms. The clinic was placed on lockdown until everyone inside can be checked by the CDC . 'Your job is basically to get beaten up by recruits,' CBS DFW said in a 2008 interview about his firing. 'Part of it is,' he replied. 'I want it to be as realistic as possible.' Thanks in part to the 2008 broadcast, Monnig was rehired by the force. Mr Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian national, exposed nearly 50 people to the disease in America before he was put in isolation at Texas Presbyterian. His fiancee Louise Troh is currently in quarantine with her 13-year-old son and two nephews and under constant monitoring by health officials over fears that they, too, could develop symptoms during a 21-day incubation period. Tough guy: Part of Monnig's job, at least back before 2008, was to take the physical blows dealt by Dallas county police recruits learning how to use batons . Fired: After sustaining an injury during his extreme training sessions that kept him off his beat, Monnig was fired. However, a local CBS report that cast light on the apparent unfair treatment got Monnig his job back . Ten people, including seven healthcare workers and three family members, are considered at high risk for Ebola after they were exposed to Duncan after he became contagious. Another 38 more are being monitors by the CDC for possible risk of the disease. Duncan's fiancee Louise Troh, who is perhaps highest at risk of catching the disease after she cared for him at her Dallas apartment while he sweated and vomited through the early staged of the disease, says she does not blame him for possibly exposing her. The White House said on Wednesday that extra screening for fever will be carried out for arriving aircraft passengers from West Africa, where the virus has killed nearly 4,000 people in three countries. The screening will start at New York's John F. Kennedy airport from the weekend, and later at Newark Liberty, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta. Authorities will use a non-invasive device to take the temperature of passengers and have them fill out a questionnaire created by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) asking for detailed information about their activities.

"Obscene: Two men and a woman have been arrested after this pig's head was left outside a community centre used by muslims . Two men and a woman have been arrested after a severed pig's head was left at the doors of a Muslim place of worship. Police were called on Boxing Day morning after the sick gesture was discovered at the entrance to the community centre in the Thurnby Lodge area of Leicester. The centre was being used by a local Muslim group - who found the offensive object when they came to unlock the automatic front door at 7.30am. Shocked Muslim locals today expressed . their disgust at the 'attack on their culture' as Islamic law strictly . forbids the eating of pork and many consider pigs to be unclean animals. Moulana . Mohammed Lockhat, 40, the Imam for the As Salaam group, said: 'We . arrived to open up the centre for prayers and found the pig's head - we . were deeply shocked and saddened. 'It . had probably come from a butchers and is clearly an act of deep, . religious discrimination against us. It is an attack on our culture. 'It is a very worrying turn of events and we are clearly not welcome, which upsets us. 'We . still had our prayers on Wednesday morning and putting a pig's head . outside isn't going to change things, except maybe make us more . determined than ever to carry on.' The . centre has recently become the focus of a row involving the British . National Party (BNP) and the As Salaam group who want to pray at a . neighbouring disused Scout hut, which is owned by Leicester City . Council. In recent months, . Muslims going to and from prayers at the venue have had to walk past . angry protesters who don't want the group to use the property. Around . 200 people, including members of the BNP attended a demonstration in . August to oppose the group's plans to have sole use of the hut. Offensive: The pig's head was left at the doors of community centre in Leicester where Muslims gather for prayers . The sick gesture was discovered at the entrance to the community centre in the Thurnby Lodge area of Leicester . Mr Lockhat added: 'We are sad that we cannot work together as a community. 'We have been part of this community for five years and we do not understand why we cannot be accepted. We would love to, we've been trying to. 'The protests are supposed to be directed at the council, but on many occasions they haven't been. It has been quite intimidating for many of our members who fear for their own safety. 'We have had pictures of our children and homes taken and been followed home and threatened with violence. 'It . was going to boil over at some point and people are fearing for their . physical safety after this deeply distressing incident.' Leicestershire . Police yesterday confirmed they had arrested a 40-year-old woman and . two men, aged 37 and 46, in connection with the racist incident. Superintendent Mark Newcombe, from Leicestershire Police, said: 'The only people using the community centre on Wednesday were from a local Muslim group and it's easy to draw the conclusion that the pig's head was meant for them, and is the reason we believe this to be religiously motivated. 'We have no tolerance for discrimination in Leicester, be that racially or religiously motivated, and we want members of the public to help us do all we can to find those responsible and bring them to justice.'

"A woman who lived on a diet of chips for 15 years has finally eaten a proper meal - after being hynoptised to overcome her debilitating fear of food. Hanna Little, 20, has eaten chips every day since she was five years old - after she developed a fear of all other foods which made her physically sick if she tried to eat them. Hanna from Truro, Cornwall, has severe Selective Eating Disorder (SED) and would suffer anxiety attacks at the thought of eating anything new. Scroll down for video . Hanna Little, 20, has eaten chips every day since she was five years old, when she developed a fear of all other foods. But one hypnotherapy session changed her life . Hanna could never eat with her friends, had to check menus before visiting restaurants and was in a constant panic about how she would react to new foods. It was only when she was forced to quit her factory job after she kept passing out due to her limited diet that she was forced to take action. Now after just one hypnotherapy session, she has managed to battle her demons - and has eaten her first proper meal - pizza - in more than a decade. Hanna said: 'Refusing foods started when I developed colic as a baby - I've had SED for as long as I can remember - I never really knew what scared me about new food. Hanna has severe Selective Eating Disorder and would suffer anxiety attacks at the thought of eating new foods - until now! She's happy to eat salad (left) whereas before would ONLY consume chips (right) Hanna visited psychologist and clinical hypnotist Felix Economakis (pictured), at The Heath therapy clinic in North London, who got her to eat a mango after their first session together . 'Different foods terrified me, it made me physically sick and anxious and I never knew how I would react. 'I would go to parties, picnics and barbecues with my friends but I would never be able to eat anything. 'I think I can eat chips because they're just plain - it was the idea of different flavours mixing together which really freaked me out. 'I could manage a slice of dry toast for breakfast, but lunch and dinner every day always had to be chips. 'Now I can eat whatever I like - my favourite food is pizza - I could never have imagined being able to eat it before the treatment but now I love it.' Hanna could never eat with her friends, had to check menus before visiting restaurants and was in a constant panic but now she eats a varied diet and her favourite meal is pizza . Different foods terrified Hanna and made her physically sick and anxious so she opted for chips every single day, which caused her to pass out at work . Hanna's mum tried to tempt her with new vegetables and fruits but would be forced to bulk buy chips and bread from the supermarket when she continually failed. Hanna said: 'When I was old enough to date I went to my boyfriend's house for dinner but I hadn't told him about my SED. 'The hypnotherapy treatment was amazing, I was so restricted before and now I can live a normal life. I feel so much healthier and I am putting weight on - I have so much more energy and I feel much happier' 'His mum made me an incredible pasta bake meal and I couldn't eat a bite of it - I pretended that I was allergic to tomato sauce - it was so embarrassing. 'Everyone I spoke to had no idea what it was and just though I was odd - I didn't find out about Selective Eating Disorder until I was 16.' Hanna visited psychologist and clinical hypnotist Felix Economakis, at The Heath therapy clinic in North London. He said: 'SED is usually caused by a trauma . associated with food - it is often something that has happened as a baby . that the patient has no conscious memory of. 'The fear of food stems from this trauma and the anxiety associated with it. 'By . unlocking the subconscious I can get the patient to process the past . and learn to let go of the fear - detraumatising the experience. Felix Economakis (left) says the results of the therapy are immediately measurable and, with 90 per cent of the SED patients he has worked with, hypnosis treatment has been incredibly effective . 'The hypnosis process takes just over an hour and at the end of the session Hanna was able to try several types of new food without anxiety. 'The result of the therapy is immediately measurable and with 90 per cent of the SED patients I have worked with, hypnosis treatment has been incredibly effective.' Hanna said: 'I'd seen so many dieticians and psychologists before I went for hypnotherapy but nothing had worked. 'I could feel my health deteriorating and I knew I had to do something about it - that's when I met Felix and he told me about hypnotherapy treatments. 'The first thing I ate after the hypnotherapy was a mango - it was so sweet and delicious and it is now my favourite fruit. 'The hypnotherapy treatment was amazing, I was so restricted before and now I can live a normal life. 'I feel so much healthier and I am putting weight on - I have so much more energy and I feel much happier.' SED is also known as picky eating, fussy eating, food phobia, selective eating, or Perseverative Feeding Disorder. It is more common among those within the autistic spectrum and in combination with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. It starts in childhood or early adolescence and the . most common cause of SED is a development of extra sensitive taste sensation, which is caused . by an increase in fungiform papilla – taste buds - throughout childhood. Typically . the food preferred by an SED sufferer are ‘comfort foods’ – bland and . refined foods, high in carbohydrates – such as pizza, cheese and chips, . often from particular brands or food outlets. The types of food will be restricted to ten or less with extreme cases only eating one or two types of food.

"The U.S. Secretary of Health says there are likely 'more cases' of Ebola on US soil and that airport screening from departure countries is essential in preventing the spread. 'We had one case and I think there may be other cases, and I think we have to recognize that as a nation,' Burwell said at a media breakfast today. Burwell focused on airport screening and said although it was not 100 percent effective she had confidence in the precaution. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . More likely more cases:  Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell has said that cases of Ebola may already be in the United States and that containment of the disease is essential for prevention . CDC director: Stopping travel to and from West Africa all together will prevent containment of the disease within Africa and will then spread to the United States and parts of Europe . 'The most important place with regard to taking care of screening is actually at the point of departure,' she said, reported the Washington Examiner. 'And that's been in place for many months and as we know, we have a case. That case sadly is deceased. But for many months, we did not have a case that entered the country. 'And we know that that screening has worked in the sense of 80 people have been pulled from the lines in the screening and stopped in the home country. And that's the most important place to do that.' Dead: Thomas Eric Duncan of Liberia is the first man to be diagnosed with Ebola on American Soil and died on Wednesday in Dallas, Texas where he was being treated for the deadly virus . The first patient diagnosed with the virus was Liberian man Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, who died on Wednesday. Since Duncan's tragic diagnosis, airports in West Africa have heightened their screening protocols to make sure no one with the virus leaves the country. According to the director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Tom Freidan, stopping travel to and from West Africa all together will prevent containment of the disease within Africa and will then spread to the United States and parts of Europe. About 8,000 healthcare workers have been communicating through an alert network and have been on CDC webinars. Europe will almost inevitably see more cases of the deadly Ebola virus within its borders but the continent is well prepared to control the disease, the World Health Organization's regional director said on Tuesday. Departure screenings: Screenings at U.S. airports in departure countries like West Africa are essential to containment and identification of the deadly virus . Speaking to Reuters just hours after Europe's first local case of Ebola infection was confirmed in a nurse in Spain, the WHO's European director, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said further such events were 'unavoidable.' Spanish health officials said four people had been hospitalized to try and stem any further spread of Ebola there after the nurse became the first person in the world known to have contracted the virus outside of Africa. 'Such imported cases and similar events as have happened inSpain will happen also in the future, most likely,' Jakab told Reuters in a telephone interview from her Copenhagen office. Spreading: Ebola has infected some 7,200 people in West Africa, killing more than 3,400 of them in the largest outbreak of the disease in history . 'It is quite unavoidable ... that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around.' Several countries in the WHO's European region, including France, Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland,Norway and Spain, have treated patients repatriated after contracting the disease in West Africa, where Ebola has been raging through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since March. Ebola has infected some 7,200 people in West Africa, killing more than 3,400 of them in the largest outbreak of the disease in history. Cases have also been imported into Nigeria, Senegal and the United States. Jakab said that within Europe, health workers caring for repatriated Ebola patients, as well as their families and close contacts, were most at risk of becoming infected. 'But the most important thing...is that Europe is still at low risk and that the western part of the European region particularly is the best prepared in the world to respond to viral hemorrhagic fevers including Ebola.'","Despite efforts in the United States to stop the spread of the deadly Ebola virus, there may be more cases on American soil than already realized .
Travelers leaving West Africa may have already brought the virus into the country, says Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell .

"Doctors no longer detect Ebola in a Texas nurse who flew to Ohio and back before she was diagnosed with the virus, her family said Wednesday. Officials at Emory University Hospital and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention couldn't detect Ebola in Amber Vinson as of Tuesday evening, her family said in a statement released through a media consultant. Doctors usually do two tests a day apart before saying they can't detect the virus. It's unclear how many tests Vinson has had. Vinson's mother, Debra Berry, spoke to her Wednesday, and Vinson has been approved for transfer from isolation, the statement said. Cured: Doctors no longer detect Ebola in Amber Vinson, the Texas nurse who flew to Ohio and back before she was diagnosed with the virus, her family said Wednesday . 'We all know that further treatment will be necessary as Amber continues to regain strength, but these latest developments have truly answered prayers and bring our family one step closer to reuniting with her at home,' Berry said. Vinson, 29, remains in treatment at Emory, near Atlanta. Emory wouldn't release any information about the patient, hospital spokeswoman Holly Korschun said. Unlike other American Ebola patients, like recently cured journalist Ashoka Mukpo, Vinson's caregivers do not appear to be releasing information about her course of treatment. Mukpo was given the experimental drug Brincidofovir and a transfusion from Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly. Brantly received another experimental drug, along with his fellow missionary worker Nancy Writebol, called ZMapp that may have helped to save them both. Brantly also gave blood to help save Dr. Rick Sacra from the disease. Sacra was also given an experimental drug called TKM-Ebola.

Personnel completely cleared shelves as they removed dozens of barrels of potentially contaminated material from Vinson's home . Personnel in hazmat gear ended up removing over 50 barrels worth of material from Vinson's home to be destroyed . Authorities have not released the treatment regimen for Vinson's co-worker Nina Pham, who was in good condition Wednesday. Along with Pham, Vinson helped care for a Liberian man with Ebola who died at a Dallas hospital. Another nurse there also became infected and is being treated outside Washington; her condition was upgraded from fair to good. Health officials say Vinson visited the Akron area Oct. 10-13 to prepare for her wedding and was diagnosed once she returned to Dallas. Officials are monitoring the health of 164 people in Ohio who are believed to have had contact with her or to have been near her. A timeline of Ebola infections in Dallas .

"A new Australian study has revealed homeopathic medicines are no more effective than a placebo . Homeopathy is no more effective than a placebo, a national medical agency has concluded in a hard-hitting report. Australia’s National Health and Medical . Research Council (NHMRC) analysed research into the effectiveness of . alternative medicines on 68 health conditions and found ‘there is no . reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective’ on any of them. The review, conducted by a working committee of medical experts, said homeopathy had no impact on a range of conditions including asthma, arthritis, sleep disturbances, cold and flu, chronic fatigue syndrome, eczema, cholera, burns, malaria and heroin addiction. The authors of the report said: ‘No good-quality, well-designed studies with enough participants for a meaningful result reported either that homeopathy caused greater health improvements than a substance with no effect on the health condition [placebo], or that homeopathy caused health improvements equal to those of another treatment.’ They went on to dismiss anecdotal support for the effectiveness of homeopathy, and urged health professionals to take account of scientific evidence when informing patients. ‘It is not possible to tell whether a health treatment is effective or not simply by considering individuals’ experiences or healthcare practitioners’ beliefs,’ they said. Homeopathy is a complementary medicine, the central principle of which is that ‘like cures like’ – that a substance that causes certain symptoms can also help to remove them in tiny doses. In England there are several NHS homeopathic hospitals and some GP practices offer the treatment but it is not widely available. The report prompted medical professionals to call for governments to stop legitimising homeopathy. Professor John Dwyer, an immunologist and emeritus professor of medicine at the University of New South Wales, told Guardian Australia the report was long overdue and said homeopathic treatments should now be ‘put away’ once and for all. Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council analysed research into the effectiveness of alternative medicines on 68 different conditions, and found 'there is no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective' on any of them . He said: ‘Obviously we understand the placebo effect. We know that many people have illnesses that are short lived by its very nature and their bodies will cure them, so it’s very easy for people to fall in trap that because they did A, B follows.’ He added he did not think it ethical to prescribe a placebo. Dr Richard Choong, Western Australia president of the Australian Medical Association, also welcomed the report and said his organisation has long held there is no evidence to support homeopathy. ‘Homeopathy is not a science. It is not based in science,’ he said. ‘In a lot of cases it can be considered dangerous and can risk people’s lives,’ said Dr Choong. Submissions from homeopathy interest groups and the public were among the studies assessed by the NHMRC, but did not alter the conclusions of the Council, in some cases due to the poor quality of the studies submitted.","Australian team looked at the impact of homeopathy on conditions including asthma, arthritis, sleep disturbances, cold and flu and eczema .

"It is said to be one of the world’s most revered paintings. Unfortunately, visitors hoping to see Hans von Marees’ Die Labung masterpiece in Germany’s Wiesbaden Museum will be a little disappointed. The picture, once among thousands of artworks looted and acquired illegitimately by the Nazis, is currently hanging back-to-front, with art-lovers only able to see the back of the picture’s antique frame. Germany's Wiesbaden Museum are currently trying to raise part of the £230,000 fee to buy Hans von Marees Die Labung painting. They will only exhibit the work once the paintings rightful owners have been paid for the artwork, which was acquired by the Nazis just before World War II . It is part of a bizarre campaign by the museum to try and raise the £230,000 needed to buy the picture from the heir of its last legal owner. The painting, which was created by German artist von Marees between 1879 and 1880, had initially belonged to the Jewish industrialist Max Silberberg. Von Marees was known for his portraits, but Die Labung - translated as 'The Refreshment' - is one of his later mythological paintings. It measures just 64 x 85cm. Mr Silberberg was forced to sell the artwork, along with the rest of his valuable collection, at auction in Berlin in 1934, under pressure from the Nazis. Both Mr Silberberg and his wife were later both murdered at Auschwitz. Hans von Marees’ Die Labung masterpiece is currently hanging back-to-front in Germany’s Wiesbaden Museum . The painting once belonged to the Jewish industrialist Max Silberberg, who was forced to sell it by the Nazis. Mr Silberberg and his wife were later both murdered at Auschwitz . The painting is believed to have spent decades in the possession of the Wiesbaden family, who bequeathed it to the museum in 1980. However, the rightful owners have now been traced to a foundation in Israel, the Gerta Silberberg Discretionary Trust. Alexander Klar, director of the Wiesbaden Museum, now hopes that the museum can collect €93,000 (£73,000) in donations to contribute one third of the cost towards the purchase of the artwork. The cultural foundation of the state Hessen and the Association of Benefactors of Wiesbaden Museum have agreed to contribute the remaining funds. They are trying to raise the money before a November 5 deadline.

Alexander Klar, director of the Wiesbaden Museum, now hopes that the museum can collect €93,000 (£73,000) in donations to contribute one third of the cost towards the purchase of the artwork . A spokesperson from the Wiesbaden Museum said: ‘The painting has been in storage and has not been seen since the 1980s. ‘We agreed on a price, but it doesn't yet belong to us, and so we won’t show it until it legally does.’ Creative agency Q came up with the idea for the campaign, which it has called ‘Wiesbaden creates the Turn!’ Q spokesman Thilo von Debschnitz explained that the campaign is seeking to not only acquire the painting, but to also raise awareness about the restitution work that art institutions in Germany are doing and are seeking to draw attention to how many ill-gotten artworks are still stored in German museums. It was during the reign of the Third Reich in Germany that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler ordered the theft of art in Germany and across Europe for a proposed Führermuseum in Linz, Austria. Towards the end of the WWII, soldiers began stumbling upon treasure troves of stolen art, including this one in a salt mine at Merkers, Germany, which is being inspected by American General Dwight D Eisenhower . Many of the works, hidden across Europe, are still missing. Last year £1bn worth of art was found in the apartment of German Cornelius Gurlitt . Monuments Men, written and directed by Hollywood star George Clooney and starring Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett, tells the story of the recovery of stolen paintings which had been plundered by the Nazis during WWII .

The MFAA involved around men and women from 17 nations. It was led by the Americans, but Britain provided the second-largest group of volunteers. The story was turned into a film called Monuments Men, written and directed by Hollywood star George Clooney and starring Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville and Cate Blanchett. The Wiesbaden Museum has already twice images returned or bought images from their rightful heirs.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin is ‘terrified’ of growing old and has undergone a facelift to give him a ‘young, dynamic appearance’, according to a documentary. The German programme also claims that the 62-year-old beat his former wife Lyudmila, and has ‘incredible delusions [of] control’ after surviving five assassination attempts in recent years. Other more bizarre claims include how he sleeps in late and works only in the afternoon after breakfasting on cottage cheese. Facelift? Vladimir Putin had wrinkles and eye bags in 2008 (left) and in 2011 (right) the lines had gone . He then takes hot and cold baths, followed by a session in a gym filled with expensive American sports equipment to hone his figure. Biographer Ben Judah told the documentary: ‘Putin is afraid of physical decay, he is afraid of ageing.’ And a western intelligence report was cited alleging the Russian leader had a facelift in 2010. But his meticulous approach to his appearance does not extend to his time-keeping. The programme claims Putin is often late for appointments. ‘He even made the Queen of England wait for half an hour, his ministers often several hours,’ one Kremlin insider said. Putin The Man is being made by German TV company ZDF and tells how the boy from St Petersburg’s slums progressed to become a KGB spy.

He was described as ‘lazy [and] drunken’ when he headed the KGB’s field office in Dresden in former East Germany between 1985 and 1990. One superior noted: ‘He was a desktop spy, a macho playing upon a safe stage.’ A file entry from the time reveals how he got inebriated at a friend’s birthday party.

His colleagues in the KGB spoke about his fondness for hard liquor.’ A source who was a KGB employee in Dresden and who befriended former Aeroflot stewardess Lyudmila, was said to have told superiors that Putin regularly beat his wife. The couple, who married in 1983 and have two daughters, divorced last year. Putin also seems to have been careless in Dresden.

"The financial crisis engulfing the eurozone has driven tens of thousands more migrants into Britain. The numbers arriving from countries worst-hit by the continent’s recession - such as Spain, Greece and Portugal - have leapt by as much as 50 per cent, official figures show. The surge from southern Europe is a blow to ministers, whose efforts to cut migration have stalled. Fury: Protesters throw stones to riot policemen during a miners' demonstration in July 2012 in Madrid, Spain . David Cameron had pledged to reduce net . migration – the number of new arrivals minus those leaving – to ‘tens of . thousands’ by the next election. However, latest figures suggest that while the Government is cutting the number coming in from outside the European Union, they are being replaced by migrants travelling within it. EU free movement rules mean ministers are powerless to prevent migrant workers coming to Britain from the continent. As a result, net migration rose last year . from 153,000 to 176,000, ending five consecutive quarters of decreases. This remains well below the levels seen in the 2000s, when net . migration consistently reached 225,000. Analysis shows fewer migrants were coming from Africa, India and Pakistan, while more arrived from southern Europe. Experts have warned of a ‘lost generation’ of young Europeans unable to get jobs. Unemployment among young Greeks reached 62.5 per cent last year while 56.4 per cent of young Spaniards and 40.5 per cent of young Italians are out of work. Now data suggests many are turning to Britain, where the economy is bouncing back and unemployment is lower. National Insurance figures for the year to March showed 50 per cent more Spaniards had registered to work in the UK. The figure for Greeks was up 44 per cent, while the number of Portuguese rose by 43 per cent. The number of Germans – whose own economy is more robust – fell by 7 per cent. The eurozone crisis has left millions out of work, and prompted violent protests in response to austerity measures. While both France and Germany saw economic growth last year, Spain and Italy are still in recession and the Greek economy is shrinking at nearly 5 per cent a year. Immigration minister Mark Harper said: ‘Immigration from outside the EU is now at its lowest level for 14 years. ‘At the same time, there has been an increase in the number of sponsored student visa applications for our world-class universities, and an increase in the number of visas issued to skilled workers.’ He reiterated that the Government is ‘committed to bringing net migration down to the tens of thousands’.","Numbers arriving from worst-hit countries have leapt by as much as 50% .

"'Myth': Many of the reported benefits of health supplements have no scientific evidence to support the claims . Millions of people who take dietary supplements to ward off cancer may be toying with a ‘two-edged sword’ that might do them harm, experts have warned. People were being misled by ‘messages from supplement manufactures’ stressing the health benefits of their products, including cancer prevention, according to a team of U.S. scientists. They said there was no good evidence that supplement pills and capsules reduced the risk of cancer in healthy individuals. They pointed out that antioxidants such as beta carotene, and vitamins C and E might even have biological effects that promote cancer. Antioxidants are believed to counter the destructive effects of rogue oxygen molecules called free radicals. Oxidative stress by free radicals, which attack cell membranes, proteins and DNA, has been linked to cancer and heart disease. But the U.S. authors, writing in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, argue that the supposed benefits of antioxidant supplements are largely a myth. The panel of five experts, led by Dr Maria Elena Martinez, from the University of California at San Diego, wrote: ‘Undoubtedly, use is driven by a common belief that supplements can improve health and protect against disease, and that at worst, they are harmless. ‘However, the assumption that any dietary supplement is safe under all circumstances and in all quantities is no longer empirically reasonable.’ Health supplements are booming in the U.S., with annual sales estimated at £18.6 billion, said the scientists, who assessed the evidence relating to several supplements including antioxidants, folic acid, vitamin D and calcium. A number of animal, laboratory and observational studies had appeared to show that dietary supplements could lower cancer risk, they said. However, these findings were not confirmed by the ‘gold-standard’ in evidence-based medicine, randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Alarm: Scientists said it is no longer true to assume, at worst, health supplements did no harm after finding some antioxidents can increase chances of cancer . Only a small number of RCTs had been carried out to test the effectiveness of dietary supplements, said the experts - and several of these had reported increased risks. ‘Supplementation by exogenous anti-oxidants may well be a two-edged sword,’ the scientists wrote. ‘These compounds could, in vivo (outside the laboratory), serve as pro-oxidants or interfere with any number of protective processes such as apoptosis induction.’ Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, causes malfunctioning cells effectively to ‘commit suicide’. Experimental studies had shown that different tissues with different cancer-triggering pathways may not respond the same way to a particular nutrient. ‘In fact, a nutrient may be associated with protection in one tissue and harm in another,’ said the experts. They added that supplement users were ‘sometimes quick to discredit caution’ and distrustful of mainstream science which they suspected of being corrupted by links to the drug industry. Users may also assume the supplements they bought to be as well regulated as over-the-counter medications. ‘These beliefs underscore the need for efforts by scientists and government officials to encourage the public to make prudent decisions based on sound evidence with respect to use of dietary supplements for cancer prevention,’ the scientists concluded. Graham Keen, Executive Director of the Health Food Manufacturers’ Association, which represents supplement manufacturers, said: 'The vitamin and mineral supplements industry has an exceptional record of both safety and efficacy, in the UK and worldwide.'","Scientists say claims of the benefits of antioxidents made are largely a 'myth'

"If you like to unwind with a glass of wine, then this might be the news you’ve been waiting for. Because according to a leading scientist, drinking just over a bottle a day won’t harm your health. Dr Kari Poikolainen, who used to work for the World Health Organisation as an alcohol expert, examined decades of research into its effects. Men are currently meant to have no more than four units a day but women are supposed to have three units – around the equivalent of a large glass of wine. A bottle of wine has ten units. But Dr Poikolainen believes drinking only becomes harmful when people consume more than around 13 units a day. Bottoms up: Dr Poikolainen also claims that a bottle of wine a day is not harmful for health . He also claimed that people who exceed the recommended limit could live longer than teetotallers. Dr Poikolainen said: ‘The weight of the evidence shows moderate drinking is better than abstaining and heavy drinking is worse than abstaining – however the moderate amounts can be higher than the guidelines say.’ But Julia Manning, from think-tank 2020Health, said: ‘This is an unhelpful contribution to the debate. It makes grand claims which we don’t see evidence for.’ She added: ‘Alcohol is a toxin, the risks outweigh the benefits.’ Dr Kari Poikolainen believes drinking only becomes dangerous when it exceeds more than 13 units per day .","Alcohol expert claims that a bottle of wine a day won't harm your health .

"Women who took SSRIs antidepressants during pregnancy were three times more likely to have a baby boy with autism . Mothers-to-be who take antidepressants have an increased risk of having a child with autism, a study has found. U.S. researchers say women who took commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs - were three times more likely to have a baby boy with autism or developmental delays. The effect of  the drugs, prescribed for depression, anxiety and other disorders, is particularity pronounced during the third trimester, they say. Researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public looked at nearly 1,000 mothers and their babies. The study, published  online in the . journal Pediatrics, looked at data from mother-child pairs in the . Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) Study. The researchers divided the data up into three groups - children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), those with developmental delays and those with typical development. All the children were aged between two to five and of them, 82  per cent of those with autism were boys,66 per cent with developmental delay were boys, as were 86 per cent of those with typical development. While the study included girls, the substantially stronger effect in boys alone suggests they may be much more susceptible for the effects of SSRIs in the womb, the researchers concluded. 'We found prenatal SSRI exposure was nearly three times as likely in . boys with autism relative to typical development, with the greatest risk . when exposure took place during the first trimester,' said study author Li-Ching Lee. 'SSRI was also elevated among boys with developmental delay, with the strongest exposure effect in the third trimester.' The effect of  the drugs, prescribed for depression, anxiety and other disorders, is particularity pronounced during the third trimester . The 'happy' hormone serotonin is critical . to early brain development, so the researchers suggest exposure during . pregnancy to anything that influences serotonin levels can have . potential effect on birth and developmental outcomes. With diagnoses of autism on the rise, they suggest increased use of SSRIs in recent years may be contributing to this. Commenting on the study,  Irva Hertz-Picciotto, chief of the Division of . Environmental and Occupational Health at UC Davis, said: 'This study provides further evidence that in some children, prenatal exposure to SSRIs may influence their risk for developing an autism spectrum disorder. 'This research also highlights the challenge for women and their physicians to balance the risks versus the benefits of taking these medications, given that a mother's underlying mental-health conditions also may pose a risk, both to herself and her child.'","The effect of  the drugs is particularity pronounced .

"One woman is hoping to dispel the taboo of female masturbation by creating a light-hearted app teaching women to have fun with the topic. New Yor-based designer Tina Gong has created the app, a game named HappyPlayTime, as a fun way for people to 'learn techniques and facts about getting off'. HappyPlayTime seeks to rebrand the entire concept of female masturbation through education, light-hearted games and cartoons. Taboo: A new app named HappyPlayTime hopes to make women feel more comfortable learning and talking about masturbation . Currently in development, the app's games hope to teach women all about female anatomy and give them thoughtful and fun lessons on masturbation techniques. Speaking to Gamification, Tina explained that her app goes back to rebranding our preconceived notions about masturbation. She explained: 'Teaching an anatomy lesson with a mission to educate about female masturbation is too much of a serious topic when taught in the traditional education model and it is difficult to separate the idea of empowering females to masturbate from a feminist perspective. 'The app's approach to education involves a quick demonstration of different masturbation techniques for each level, followed by a freestyle portion that has the player perform each technique on the mascot. Light-hearted: The app's games hope to teach women all about female anatomy and give them thoughtful and fun lessons on masturbation techniques . 'Completion of each level builds up to a fantastically funny and wacky climax upon completion.' She hopes that by downloading, playing and sharing her game with their friends (and having a few laughs along the way), the inherent taboo surrounding the subject can be dispelled. And it seems that the Twittersphere are already supporting the app. Tweet Tweet: Tina hopes that by downloading, playing and sharing her game with their friends the inherent taboo surrounding the subject can be dispelled, and Twitter are already in support of it .

"The United Nations sparked fury today after launching an unprecedented inquiry into Britain’s treatment of the disabled. The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities launched a formal probe into whether this country has committed ‘grave or systemic violations’ of the rights of disabled people. Tory MPs tonight branded the investigation ‘politically motivated’ and said Britain’s record on help for disabled people was among the best in the world. Scroll down for video . A spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith's Work and Pensions department said the UK spends £50 billion a year on disabled people . The focus on Britain for the latest inquiry raised eyebrows given the other countries represented on the committee. Its members include Uganda, Kenya, Thailand, and Tunisia. The investigation is the latest in a series of interventions into British domestic policy by the United Nations, which have provoked fury among ministers. Earlier this year a group of UN poverty ‘ambassadors’ attacked Government welfare reforms, and last year the UN’s controversial Brazilian housing ‘rapporteur’ Raquel Rolnik, a former Marxist dubbed the ‘Brazil Nut’, criticised cuts to housing benefit. Tory MP Michael Ellis said: ‘This politically motivated loony left decision brings the UN organisation in to disrepute. ‘At a time when there are grave international crises around the world and when in dozens of countries around the world there are no benefits available, this absurd decision is made to attack our country which rightly does more than almost any other to protect the rights of disadvantaged people from all walks of life.’ Brazilian UN poverty ambassador Raquel Rolnik criticised the British government's 'bedroom tax' earlier this year - sparking anger among Tory MPs . Fellow Conservative Philip Davies said: ‘These people at the UN are idiots, frankly. There’s no other way to describe them. ‘This country has led the way in the support and rights that we give to disabled people – such as through the Disability Discrimination Act which was passed by a Conservative government in 1995. ‘If the UN drew up a list of countries in the world showing how much they gave to disabled people they would find the UK was the highest in the world. ‘They are exposing the UN for the completely useless organisation that it is.’ The investigation is officially confidential, but a former member of the committee confirmed its existence in a video posted on the internet. Professor Gabor Gombos told a conference in Galway, Ireland: ‘Where the issue has been raised and the government did not really make effective actions to fix the situation…it is a very high threshold thing, the violations should be grave and very systemic.’ The existence of the inquiry, which was reported by Disability News Service. The committee did not respond to requests by the Mail for comment, but Jorge Araya, the committee’s secretary, told DNS: ‘Inquiry proceedings…of the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, are confidential.’ Miss Rolnik sparked a furious reaction from Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith after she criticised the so-called ‘Bedroom Tax’. She also signed a letter from a group of poverty ‘ambassadors’ criticising other welfare reforms designed to cut Britain’s huge benefits bill and encourage unemployed people back in to work. Another UN inspector, South African feminist academic Rashida Manjoo, was crticised after she claimed Britain had a culture of sexism worse than any other country in the world. The Department for Work and Pensions also refused to comment on the inquiry, but pointed out the UK spends around £50billion a year on disabled people. A spokesman said: ‘All United Nations inquiry processes are confidential. MUST . 'This Government is committed to supporting disabled people and we continue to spend around £50bn a year on disabled people and their services.’ For those aged between 16 and 64, the disability living allowance (DLA) - benefits given to disabled people to help them with daily activities and moving around - has now been replaced by the personal independence payment (PIP). Unlike the previous payment, PIP includes a face-to-face consultation with a heath worker to assess people's ability at tasks such as washing and cooking, before scoring their abilities on a chart. This chart is then used to work out how much money they can receive, and regular check-ups are scheduled to ensure this is kept at the right level. In 2012, there were over 3 million DLA claimants in the UK, but the Government estimates 600,000 fewer disabled people will qualify for PIP by 2018. The Work Capability Assessment was also introduced for those claiming Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance and Income Support on the grounds of illness or disability. This meant that almost two million people were assessed by health workers to see what sort of jobs they could perform and whether they were fit to work. Those ruled unfit for work were then moved on to the new Employment and Support Allowance and were given another exam, again using a points-based system, to decide how much support they qualified for.","UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has opened probe .

"Edward Snowden, the former . National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who leaked classified details of U.S. government's surveillance programs, has been . reunited in Russia with his long-time girlfriend. Lindsay Mills, a pole dancer who lived with Snowden, 31, before he fled the United States, moved to Moscow, Russia, to join him in July this year. Mills had initially stayed behind in Hawaii, where the two had lived together, in the wake of the political firestorm unleashed by the Snowden leaks last summer, a new documentary showed. The film shows the two cooking together in an apartment in Moscow, where he was given political asylum by Vladimir Putin's regime. Snowden now has a three-year residency permit. Scroll down for video . Leaker: Snowden, left, who has claimed political asylum in Vladimir Putin's Russia, has been reunited with his pole-dancing girlfriend Lindsay Mills, right . Leaker: Snowden, who handed over huge amounts of classified information from the National Security Agency, stars in a new documentary which reveals he is living with his girlfriend under Putin's protection in Russia . Together again: The two, pictured on a Hawaiian beach before Snowden fled the U.S., have now reunited in Russia . Snowden is wanted in the United States under the Espionage Act. Mills had remained silent and her whereabouts were largely . unknown after Snowden's release of tens of thousands of . classified U.S. intelligence documents in 2013. Citizenfour, made by U.S. film maker Laura Poitras, premiered on Friday in New York, revealing Mills's location in the process. The film also suggests that there could be a second NSA leaker waiting in the wings, who had access to far more information that Snowden. It came as a top spy revealed how Snowden's leaked documents have made the job of monitoring terrorists far more difficult. Sir Iain Lobban, the outgoing head of the British government's NSA equivalent, GCHQ, revealed that since the revelations it now takes three times as long to complete routine monitoring tasks. An unnamed employee made the revelation as part of the interview and profile of the GCHQ service in the Daily Telegraph. Moscow living: Snowden was pictured on the Moscow river, flowing through the Russian capital where he sought asylum from U.S. authorities . More of this: The pair are pictured frolicking together before he fled the United States . Secrecy: Snowden hid his identity when speaking to journalists, using the name Citizenfour - now the film's title . Hollywood treatment: The Snowden film will show in theaters later this month . Dancer: Mills, pictured left and right in an online video, is filmed cooking with Snowden in the documentary . The new film is a fly-on-the wall account of Snowden's tense days . in a Hong Kong hotel and his encounters with journalists from . the Washington Post and the Guardian as they prepared to print protected information on NSA activities. It puts a Hollywood glamour on the former contractor, who is shown wearing contact lenses rather than his traditional glasses, and wearing mousse in his hair. It also shows scenes of his relationship with Mills immediately after the links. She is shown telling him about agents showing up at their house after he didn't go to work - and also asking why his rent checks have stopped. At one point he tells the camera 'she has no idea' - but claims he used the cover of going to Hong Kong on vacation to protect her. Citizenfour takes its title from the email alias that . Snowden used when he first approached Poitras in early 2013 . through a series of encrypted emails - with a view to leaking . details of the top-secret programs to the media. Marketed as a 'real-life thriller,' it is the first of . several films in the works about Snowden, who is wanted by . the United States on charges brought under the Espionage Act. Speaking in the film, Snowden says: 'I already know how this will end for me, and I accept the . risk. Floored: Another photograph uploaded by Mills seems to show the two laying down on a carpet . Parents: Snowden's mother Karen, left, and father Lonnie, right, pose with director Laura Poitras, center, after the screening of the film . Poitras, speaking after the screening, said: 'This was a film we had to make as privately and secretly as . we could.' 'We very much wanted to communicate in this film that [it] was about people who take risks and come forward at huge . personal sacrifice.' Director: Citizenfour, the Snowden documentary, was made by Laura Poitras . Poitras, an American, now lives in Berlin, Germany. She has been . stopped and questioned when entering the U.S. numerous times in . the past 10 years. Snowden's revelations sparked a global debate on the limits . of privacy versus the needs of national security. His critics view him as a traitor who refuses to face trial in the U.S. for his actions, while supports see him as a hero who spoke up for civil . liberties. Journalist Glenn Greenwald, who along with Poitras was . Snowden's first points of contact with the media, said he hoped . that Citizenfour would allow the public to form their own . opinion about the man and his motives. He said: 'So much has been said about Ed Snowden, a lot of it bad but . a lot of it really good. 'I felt like this was really the first . time that people got to see who he really is so that they could . make up their own mind. 'I always felt... that the most powerful part of the story . was not going to be the documents and the revelations but the . power of the story and the acts of this very, kind of ordinary . young man, who decided very consciously to sacrifice his whole . life for a political principle.' Poitras said she had shown the documentary to Snowden on a . trip to Russia about three weeks ago, when the brief scenes with . his girlfriend were filmed.","NSA leaker reunited with dancer Linsday Mills, with whom he lived in Hawaii .

"An Indian woman is thought to have had the world's longest ectopic pregnancy after doctors removed the skeleton of a baby that had been inside her for nearly four decades. Kantabai Thakre became pregnant at the age of 24, in 1978. At the time doctors warned the expectant mother her unborn child had little chance of survival, after it was found to be growing outside of her womb. Terrified at the thought of an operation, she fled and sought treatment for the pain at a small clinic. Scroll down for video . Indian woman Jyoti Kumar, 62, is thought to have had the world's longest ectopic pregnancy, after an MRI scan (pictured) revealed a child's skeleton inside her abdomen, after she became pregnant at the age of 24 . Months later when the pain subsided, Ms Thakre was convinced the problem had been treated. But 36 years later, the now 60-year-old started to experience constant pain in her stomach. She visited doctors at the NKP Salve Institute of Medical Sciences, in the central Indian city of Nagpur. Doctors felt a lump on her lower right side and a sonography and CT scan discovered a mass made of hard, calcified matter. Dr Murtaza Akhtar, head of surgery at the hospital, said: 'She was complaining of consistent pain in her abdomen and she had urinary problems with high fever. 'Then we found a lump on her right side but we feared it was cancer. 'After she went for an MRI and CT scan we could make out that it was actually a matured skeleton encapsulated in a calcified sac. ‘When we asked her for her medical history she told us that she was pregnant in 1978 but her child had died. 'She told us she had got scared and went home to her village without ever removing the fetus. 'She only took some treatment from her local a health centre. ‘It could be the world’s longest ectopic pregnancy.’ The team searched for medical literature on similar cases and found a Belgian woman who had retained the remains of an ectopic pregnancy for 18 years, the longest period they could find on record. Doctors warned Ms Kumar at the time that her unborn child was unlikely to survive after it was found growing outside of her womb. Terrified at the thought of an operation, the then 24-year-old fled, and sought treatment for the pain at a local clinic. Months later when the pain subsided, she believed the problem had been treated. Pictured, is the child's skeleton laid out after surgery . Dr Mohammad Yunus Shah, added: 'We believe this could be the longest case on record at 38 years. 'We asked for a detailed medical history and all we could get was that the patient's brother told us that in 1978 she was pregnant and had some complications. 'She apparently knew that the baby had died and that she would need an operation, and we gathered she got scared at the prospect of surgery and so went away to her village without undergoing the operation.' The team of surgeons discovered a mass containing a matured skeleton encapsulated in a calcified sac. The mass was found between the uterus, the intestines and bladder, densely stuck to all the organs. 'The amniotic fluid that protects the foetus might have been absorbed and the soft tissues liquefied over time with only a bag of bones with some fluid remaining,' Dr Shah said. 'For the last few months, the patient was experiencing pain and urinary problems with fever. He said this was caused by the mass compressing the urinary system, compromising the functioning of the kidneys.

"Young people who keep their hearts healthy may be less likely to suffer Alzheimer's in later life, say researchers. They found those with healthier levels of blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol in their 20s had better brain function 25 years later. People with small signs of deteriorating heart health when young were less likely to score well in cognitive tests in middle-age. An elderly woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease, in a residential home specialising in the care of people with dementia (file picture) Study author Dr Kristine Yaffe, a neuropsychiatrist, epidemiologist and professor at the University of California-San Francisco, said: 'It's amazing that as a young adult, mildly elevated cardiovascular risks seem to matter for your brain health later in life. 'We're not talking about old age issues, but lifelong issues.' There are 800,000 people living with dementia in the UK - a figure expected to rise to a million by 2021. The report is one of the first comprehensive long-term studies looking at the effect of key risk factors for heart disease and stroke on brain function. Altogether 3,330 18 to 30-year-olds had their blood pressure, fasting blood sugar and cholesterol levels checked every two to five years. Researchers analysed each person's cumulative cardiovascular health over 25 years. At the end of the study, published in the journal Circulation, the participants took three tests measuring memory, thinking speed and mental flexibility. Researchers found those with healthier levels of blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol in their 20s had better brain function 25 years later . Those with blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels slightly higher than recommended guidelines when they were young, had lower scores in cognitive function tests in their 40s and 50s. The average differences found, although small, were considered statistically significant by the researchers. Elevated blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol are three major risk factors for atherosclerosis, the slow narrowing of arteries caused by a build-up of plaque in the artery walls leading to the brain and heart. Dr Yaffe said the narrowing of the arteries leading to and in the brain was the most likely explanation for the link between cardiovascular health and cognitive function. She said: 'Our study is hopeful, because it tells us we could maybe make a dent in the risks of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia by emphasising the importance of controlling risk factors among younger people.' Previous research suggests that eating a Mediterranean diet can help prevent memory loss and may stave off Alzheimer's. The diet rich in plant foods and fish, and low intake of red meat, appears to improve vascular function, the flexibility of cells lining the walls of blood vessels, which help keep arteries supplying heart and brain healthy. Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'There is mounting evidence to suggest that keeping healthy when we are younger may help preserve memory and thinking skills in later life. 'Previous research has shown that high blood pressure, high blood sugar and raised cholesterol may all be linked to an increased risk of dementia. 'While there's currently no certain way to prevent dementia, evidence suggests that eating a healthy diet, doing regular exercise, not smoking, not drinking too much and keeping blood pressure in check could help reduce the risk of the condition. 'Research to build a more detailed picture of the risk factors for dementia is vital, as the better we understand these factors, the more able we will be to take action to lower our risk. 'If we could delay the onset of Alzheimer's, the most common cause of dementia, by five years, we could halve the number of people living with the disease - that means investment in research is crucial.'","Study is one of the first long-term studies into Alzheimer's .

"A 22-year-old Dutch woman's ear turned black after she was bitten by a Mediterranean recluse spider in Italy . A Dutch woman’s ear turned black after she was bitten by a poisonous spider in Italy. Part of the 22-year-old’s ear was liquefied by the Mediterranean recluse spider’s venom and the skin and cartilage died. The woman’s experience is thought to be the first evidence that recluse spider venom can destroy cartilage. The patient’s health problems began when she woke up with a painful ear one morning, LiveScience reports. Her ear swelled up so, unaware she had been bitten by a spider, she visited a local hospital where she was given antihistamine. Despite this treatment, the swelling and pain failed to subside. By the time she returned to the Netherlands, part of her ear had turned back indicating the cells had died. The woman sought medical help and doctors realised she had been bitten by a Mediterranean recluse spider as the creature’s venom is known to kill skin. However, Dr Marieke van Wijk, a plastic surgeon involved in the patient’s care, explained this was the first time doctors had seen the spiders’ venom destroy cartilage as well as skin. The spiders’ venom kills cells using a complex mixture of chemicals which break down proteins and there is no drug treatment that is known to be effective. As a result, Dr van Wijk and her colleagues were forced to remove the dead tissue from the woman’s ear and then rebuild it using cartilage from her ribs. The Mediterranean recluse spider originated in the Mediterranean region of North Africa and Europe but it is now widely distributed. It has poisonous venom but is thought only to bite when forced into contact with people - for example, if trapped in clothes or bedding. In rare cases, the spiders’ bites can be fatal as they can cause kidney failure. The spider's venom liquefied part of the woman's ear and caused some of the skin and cartilage to die. The dead tissue had to be cut away (left) and then the ear had to be rebuilt using cartilage from her ribs (right) Normally, bites cause a red patch to develop on the skin which leaves a slow-healing, open wound and exposed muscle. It can take up to two months for the wound to heal and it often leaves a sunken scar. Dr van Wijk told LiveScience that the spiders are ‘not that dangerous’ and that she ‘wouldn’t take precautions’ to avoid a bite. The case was reported in the Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery.","The Dutch woman, 22, was bitten by a Mediterranean recluse spider in Italy .

"If you want to improve your health while giving your sex life a boost, try a cup of moringa tea with your breakfast. Moringa, or ‘miracle tree’, is being hailed as a superfood that not only increases energy levels and boosts the immune system, but can also be an aphrodisiac. Native to North Africa and the Himalayan mountains in northwestern India, the plant has traditionally been used to boost sexual desire and to treat male sexual disorders. The plant, which can be taken as a tea, or in tablet, powder or oil format, is said to help the body recover . A recent study in the International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences found that it enhanced sexual behaviour in rats. It’s also known to contain chemical compounds called saponins which have been shown in other studies to support libido and levels of the sex hormone testosterone. Gram for gram, moringa has seven times the vitamin C found in oranges, four times the calcium of milk, four times the vitamin A of carrots, three times the potassium of bananas and three times the iron of spinach. Its tiny leaves are also high in protein, with twice the amount found in yoghurt. The plant, which can be taken as a tea, or in tablet, powder or oil format, is said to help the body recover after exercise, and is also rich in zeatin, a plant hormone which has an anti-ageing effect on skin cells. Nutritionist Daniel Herman, founder of the Bio-Synergy nutrition brand, said: ‘Moringa has a number of different benefits for general wellbeing. ‘It’s an anti-inflammatory – if you’ve just done the London Marathon, for example, it’s a great product to take for niggles – and some studies suggest it can regulate blood sugar levels. ‘It can also boost the immune system – it’s a rich source of antioxidants like Vitamin A and C, which can fight free radicals. The plant is native to the Himalayan mountians and is rich in vitamins, helping it boost the immune system . ‘The aphrodisiac effect might be because it improves blood flow, which can certainly help men.’ Lorna Driver-Davies, a nutritionist for health product firm NutriCentre, said: ‘Moringa looks to be an exciting new food. ‘Good scientific research has shown it has antioxidant effects; it may work as an anti-inflammatory and may be used for liver support.’ It is thought to have been used by the ancient Greeks, Romans and Egyptians and is recommended for 300 health conditions in traditional ayurvedic medicine. Mr Herman added: ‘Moringa has been around for years but there is suddenly a lot of interest in this from the scientific community.’","The Morigna, native to North African and the Himalayan mountains, is being hailed as a superfood .

"An outdated three-reel slot machine is drawing in bigger crowds than a Celine Dion show at Las Vegas casino MGM Grand. The Lion's Share has failed to produce a single jackpot in almost 20 years, and has attracted a legion of dedicated gamblers who believe it's going to pay out millions of dollars any day. The Lion's Share is the lone survivor of a slew of $1 progressive slot machines from the early 1990s. Growing daily: The Lion's Share and its ever-growing jackpot . According to Nevada law, slot machines are required to pay out 75 per cent of the money that goes in to them. Therefore, the Lion's Share isn't going anywhere, at least not until somebody wins the jackpot. The machine is the oldest three-reeled slot on the MGM gaming floor and has the highest level of 'occupancy,' or daily time played, of all 1,900 of the casino's machines, Justin Andrews, the MGM's executive director of slots, told the Wall Street Journal. The cult slot machine even has a Facebook page and a Twitter account with the description: 'Tracking the MGM Lion's Share – the progressive slot machine that still hasn't hit!' 'This game probably gets played about five times more than the average game on our casino floor,' Andrews told the Wall Street Journal, adding that staff are constantly being asked where the machine is by curious visitors.

"Health risk: Painkillers used by millions of Britons have been linked to higher risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger a stroke (file picture) Painkillers used by millions of Britons have been linked to higher risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger a stroke. The extra chance of developing atrial fibrillation is as high as 84 per cent, Dutch researchers say. The condition – a leading cause of first-time strokes – means the upper chambers of the heart are out of rhythm and beat much faster than normal, which allows blood to pool and clot. At least seven million Britons with arthritis take prescription painkillers, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac and ibuprofen, and newer medication called coxibs. In the study, the heart health of 8,423 people aged 55 and older was tracked since 1990 in Rotterdam. Cases of atrial fibrillation were diagnosed using heart tracer recordings, while the details of drugs prescribed were gathered from pharmacies. The average age of the study participants was 68, and just over half were women, says a report in the online journal BMJ Open. During the average monitoring period of just under 13 years, 857 participants developed atrial fibrillation. Of these 261 had never used NSAIDs when they were diagnosed, while 554 had used NSAIDs in the past, and 42 were currently taking these drugs. Current use was associated with a 76 per cent greater risk of atrial fibrillation than for those who had never taken NSAIDs. Age, sex and underlying heart problems were taken into account. Use of the painkillers within the preceding 30 days was linked to an 84 per cent greater risk of atrial fibrillation. While there was a trend for higher doses to be linked to higher atrial fibrillation risk, the finding was not statistically significant. Anti-inflammatory: At least seven million Britons with arthritis take prescription painkillers, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac and ibuprofen (pictured) It is thought NSAIDs may contribute to heart rhythm problems by increasing blood pressure as a result of fluid retention. Bruno Stricker, of the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, said previous research had thrown up a link between atrial fibrillation and these painkillers. ‘Our results also suggest that the increased risk occurs shortly after starting treatment and may disappear over time,’ he added. NSAIDs work by blocking the COX-2 enzyme which reduces pain and inflammation, but is also important in regulating heart function. There were 17million prescriptions for NSAIDs in the UK in 2010. Ibuprofen can be bought from pharmacists and supermarkets, along with Voltarol tablets containing diclofenac but at far lower doses than on prescription. Around ten years ago the anti-arthritis drug Vioxx was voluntarily taken off the market because of an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. Professor Colin Baigent, of the clinical trial service unit and epidemiological studies unit at Oxford University, said: ‘This study is consistent with previous reports indicating that some NSAIDs increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. ‘Atrial fibrillation is just one of several cardiac hazards associated with NSAIDs, the most important of which is an increased risk of heart attacks. On sale: There were 17million prescriptions for NSAIDs in the UK in 2010. Ibuprofen can be bought from pharmacists and supermarkets, along with Voltarol tablets (pictured) containing diclofenac . ‘Although NSAIDs are very effective for . the treatment of pain, it is important that both risks and benefits are . considered carefully before they are prescribed.’ Oxford researchers last year found that high doses of NSAIDs can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and heart failure. Their study confirmed the existence of a ‘small but significant’ extra risk of dying from heart problems after prolonged use. The research, published in The Lancet medical journal, found naproxen was the safest NSAID. Researchers looked at the highest doses of painkillers prescribed by doctors, twice the daily amount recommended for headache and other minor ailments. They said a short course of tablets bought over the counter for a muscle sprain was unlikely to be hazardous. The study pooled the findings from 639 trials after numerous small trials showed a link between NSAIDs and heart side effects.","Painkillers may raise risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger stroke .

"Research has revealed that diesel fumes could cause children to develop autism and schizophrenia . An environmental report has blasted diesel cars  - despite earlier government efforts to encourage drivers to switch from petrol to diesel. Separate research has also revealed that diesel fumes could cause children to develop autism and schizophrenia. Nitrogen dioxide, a chemical present in diesel emissions, causes eye, nose and throat irritation and is said to cause breathing problems in young children. But scientists have warned that as well as damaging the lungs, the fumes could cause autism and schizophrenia to develop within . children living near busy roads. Long-term exposure to the fumes changes the way that a child's brain develops, it has been revealed. The . danger of the fumes has been compared to the effect of lead in petrol. In 1999, lead in petrol was banned after scientists revealed that lead . additives caused brain damage in children. The concerns over the fumes have been raised in a report by the World Health Organisation. Dr Ian Mudway, a researcher in respiratory toxicology at King's College, and a co-author of the report told The Sunday Times that there is 'strong evidence' that diesel pollutants have an effect on cognitive function in children. Dr Mudway said the organisation planned to carry out more research on the theme in London because the original study was conducted in California where diesel vehicle use is significantly lower. The study, from California, reported last . year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, looked at 525 . children, 279 of the children had autism. London was covered in a cloud of smog last week after dust from the Sahara became became mixed with pollution from Europe and the UK . A warning from the Air Quality Expert Group in report by commissioned by the UK Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has raised concerns that nitrogen dioxide emissions, created by diesel cars, have continued to rise over the past decade . Results found that the pollution . levels experienced by mothers' during pregnancy and by the babies the first year of their life were . strongly linked to the risk of developing autism. A . further two American studies found that older men and women exposed to . high levels of pollution experienced higher memory loss compared to . others of the same age. Much . of the research on the topic has come from the United States - despite . the fact that diesel is mainly used in buses and heavy goods vehicles there rather than normal cars. Research in California found that the pollution levels experienced by mothers' during pregnancy and by the babies the first year of their life were strongly linked to the risk of developing autism . On Wednesday in London, there was a surge in 999 calls after a cloud of smog caused breathing problems across the city. Now a warning from the Air Quality Expert Group in report by commissioned by the UK . Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has raised . concerns that nitrogen dioxide emissions, created by diesel cars, have . continued to rise over the past decade. In the study, scientists have urged ministers to make a u-turn back to petrol vehicles. The . air quality group, which provides independent scientific advice to the . government, told ministers that it would be easier to promote petrol . rather than attempt to clean up diesel. One of the authors of the report, David Carslaw, blasted the European Union for the 'complete failure' of the way emissions are regulated. Mr . Carslaw told The Sunday Times that European guidelines on testing cars . were 'too lenient'. Tests did not reflect how vehicles perform on real . roads, where they produce four to five times the number of emissions, he said. Mr Carslaw said: 'Switching to petrol is the best idea for light vehicles', which includes cars, taxis and small vans. A switch from diesel to petrol would be a lengthy process because a third of Britain's 29million private cars are diesel-powered.

"It has boosted loved lives across the world - but new research suggests men who take Viagra may significantly increase their risk of skin cancer. American researchers found those who took sildenafil, more commonly known as Viagra, were 84 per cent more likely to get melanoma, the most deadly form of the disease. It is thought the impotence drug may affect the same genetic mechanism that enables skin cancer to become more invasive. Risk? Men who used Viagra had were 84 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, a study found . However the researchers add that because the study is preliminary, it is too early to advise men to stop taking the little blue pill. 'Because it’s just one early study, no one is suggesting that men stop taking Viagra to treat erectile dysfunction,' study co-author Dr Abrar Qureshi, professor of dermatology at Brown University, told NBC News. But he advised those taking Viagra who have a high risk of melanoma should think about speaking with their doctor. He added that the risk of less dangerous - and more common skin cancers, such as basal cell or squamous cell cancers - was no higher in men who took the drug. The study, of 26,000 men in the U.S and . China, analysed information from the Health Professionals’ Follow-up . Study, which collects data about male healthcare workers (including . doctors). Doctors say the Viagra effect held even after factors such as a man's sun exposure and family history were taken into account . Of those included in the study, the average age was 65 and six per cent had taken the erectile dysfunction drug. The research, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine this week, showed that men who took Viagra even once had double the risk of developing melanoma. Dr Qureshi added that risk factors for skin cancer - such as the amount of sunlight exposure a man had and family history of the disease - had been taken into account. Other well-known side-effects of Viagra include heartburn, nausea and headaches. The drug is also unsuitable for men with angina or very high blood pressure.","Impotence drug may affect the same genetic mechanism that enables skin cancer to become more invasive, say U.S. researchers .

"Lieutenant Hadar Goldin, who was captured earlier this month. In the aftermath heavy shelling was unleashed on the southern Gaza town of Rafah . The Israeli military has been criticised over using the so-called 'Hannibal procedure' tactic to stop the capture of soldiers, which has killed over 100 Palestinians. The army has used the procedure, which allows overwhelming fire after soldiers when it is feared militants have captured an officer. It was allegedly used recently when heavy shelling was unleashed on the southern Gaza town of Rafah after the capture of Lieutenant Hadar Goldin earlier this month. Now, a group is calling on the military to abandon the practice, saying it puts captured soldiers at unreasonable risk and can lead to civilian deaths. The Association for Civil Rights in . Israel, a prominent rights group, has asked the government to strike . down the doctrine and investigate its use. In . a letter to Israel's attorney general they wrote: 'A protocol that puts . the life of the captured soldier in jeopardy to thwart a kidnapping is . fundamentally unacceptable. 'Implementing this protocol in . populated areas, wherein the soldier and his captors are surrounded by a . civilian population that is not taking part in hostilities, is strictly . prohibited.' Israel's Justice Ministry declined to comment, merely saying it received the letter. New recruits to the Israeli army learn that if they see a soldier being captured and rushed away in a car, they should shoot at the vehicle to stop its progress, even if it risks the soldier's life. The 'Hannibal Procedure' was designed in the mid-1980s by Yossi Peled, then head of Israel's Northern Command, after Hezbollah guerrillas captured two soldiers in southern Lebanon. However, its use in the recent conflict has angered critics who say it may have led to the deaths of scores of Palestinians earlier this month, when Israeli soldiers feared militants had captured Lieutenant Goldin. Hamas fire killed Goldin and two other Israeli soldiers near Rafah, along Gaza's southern border with Egypt, shortly after an internationally brokered cease-fire took effect. According to Israeli media reports, three bodies were found at the scene shortly after the ambush, but upon closer inspection troops realized that one of them was a Hamas militant disguised in an Israeli uniform — raising fears that Hamas had captured Goldin. Scroll down for video . The aftermath of Israeli airstrikes in Rafah in southern Gaza after the capture of Lieutenant Hadar Goldin . The shelling earlier this month is said to have killed over 100 Palestinians in Gaza . That's when 'Hannibal' allegedly went . into effect, with Israel unleashing a massive barrage of airstrikes and . artillery fire aimed at blocking any potential escape routes of the . kidnappers. Defying . protocol, a fellow officer rushed into one of the tunnels and found some . personal effects belonging to Goldin that helped the military later . rule him dead. The Israeli military would not officially confirm whether the tactic was enacted after Goldin's disappearance, but multiple officials say the rare order was given. The heavy shelling levelled the area in Rafah, killing some 100 Palestinians, Palestinian health officials say. A 72-hour ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is set to end at midnight tonight local time . A Palestinian boy holds bomb remnants and a bullet belt during the temporary ceasefire in Gaza . Asa Kasher, a philosophy professor who authored the military's official code of conduct in the 1990s, said the 'Hannibal Procedure' has been grossly misunderstood and strikes a delicate balance between protecting the lives of soldiers and carrying out military responsibilities. Much of the directive remains classified, but Kasher stressed the conventional wisdom of a 'dead soldier being better than a captive soldier' was a fallacy. 'That is just an awful saying and totally untrue. It goes against every value of the Israeli military', he said. However, . Tamar Feldman, an ACRI lawyer, said the practice violates the potential . captive's human rights. When employed in a crowded area like Gaza, it . raised even more questions. Since the latest truce went into effect on Sunday, Israel has halted military operations in the coastal territory and Gaza militants have stopped firing rockets . She said: 'A command that subjugates the life of a soldier to an unknown political gain ... is both cynical and revolting. 'Activating this protocol in the heart of an urban and civilian environment is particularly grave; it shakes the foundations of law and morality and must be absolutely condemned.' It comes as 72-hour truce between Israel and Hamas is set to expire at midnight local time with negotiators in Cairo trying to thrash out a more permanent ceasefire arrangement. Since the latest truce went into effect on Monday, Israel has halted military operations in the coastal territory and Gaza militants have stopped firing rockets.","Army used tactic for overwhelming fire dubbed 'Hannibal Procedure'

"A £200million London skyscraper which melted cars by reflecting sunlight has been fitted with shading. The concave design and mirrored glass of 20 Fenchurch Street, which is more commonly known as the Walkie Talkie due to its distinctive shape, had caused the sun to shine powerful, focused rays of light onto the street below. But workers have fitted the 37-storey building, which has been nicknamed as the 'Walkie Scorchie' by those who work nearby, with a 'sunshade' to deflect the rays. Scroll down for video . The 525ft building, 20 Fenchurch Street, has been fitted with a sunshade known as a 'brise soleil' to prevent the glare from damaging cars and nearby shops in London . Several motorists had reported the unusual phenomenon, including Martin Lindsay who had parked his black Jaguar XJ in Eastcheap last summer. He turned to his car after an hour and found the wing mirror and panels had been damaged. Parts of the car had 'buckled' and there was a smell of burning plastic. He said at the time: 'They’re going to have to think of something. I’m gutted. How can they let this continue?' While heating and air conditioning engineer, Eddie Cannon, said his Vauxhall Vevaro suffered a similar fate the day before. He said: 'The van looks a total mess – every bit of plastic on the left hand side and everything on the dashboard has melted, including a bottle of Lucozade that looks like it has been baked.' The building has been nicknamed the 'Walkie Scorchie' by nearby workers who faced being glared by the sun in a particular patch of the street at the same time of day . It is thought the distinctive shape of the 'Walkie Talkie', which was designed by architect Rafael Viñoly and cost over £200 million, caused the sun to reflect intense rays . The damage caused to Martin Lindsay's black Jaguar XJ after he parked it in Eastcheap last summer. Joint developers Land Securities and Canary Wharf reportedly paid out £1,000 in compensation to motorists who had their cars damaged by the sun . Blinding: Martin Lindsay with his Jaguar XJ, which was damaged by bright light reflected down from the tower . Further damage: The seat of a bicycle parked near the building was also allegedly singed by the blinding rays . Due to it's concave design, sunlight was reflected into a very localised point in the early afternoon. Pictured a man is bathed in light from the building . My eyes! City workers out for a cigarette pull amusing expressions as they see the light . It is an architectural feature which reduces heat gain by deflecting sunlight. They can range from patterned concrete walls to a wing-like mechanism. It is usually a horizontal projection extending from the sunside facade of a building. Nearby shops were also damaged by the intense sun rays. One shopkeeper said the glare caused his doormat to start smoking and scorched a lemon, another said it blistered paint - and one journalist even managed to fry an egg with the startlingly bright rays. Ali Akay, of Re Style barber's, said the position of the sun at a certain time of the day caused a searing bolt of sunlight to start a small fire and burn a hole in his company doormat. He said: ‘We were working and just saw the smoke coming out of the carpet. We tried to cut the fire down, there were customers in at the time and they were obviously not happy. ‘Customers are not going to come in if there is a fire in the front of the door.’ Joint developers Land Securities and Canary Wharf investigated and as a precautionary measure suspended parking in three bays in the area. It also installed a temporary screen before a permanent cover was installed this year - known as a 'brise soleil' sunshade. The developer, which reportedly paid out £1,000 in compensation, said: 'It will not interfere with the customer fit-out or occupation. The cost involved has not altered our original estimated total cost of the building.'

"Furious activists fighting against anti-Semitism have demanded that a French hamlet changes its name from 'Death to Jews'. Anger against the small settlement of La-Mort-aux-Juifs - which has a population of less than 20 and is around 60 miles south of Paris - comes amid increasing claims of anti-Jewish prejudice in France. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre, an . internationally renowned Jewish pressure group, has now sent a letter to . France's Interior Minister to complain about the hamlet's name, and . express shock that nothing has previously been done to address its . controversial moniker. Controversial: Anger against the small settlement of La-Mort-aux-Juifs (pictured) - which has a population of less than 20 and is 60 miles south of Paris - comes amid increasing claims of anti-Jewish prejudice in France . Shimon . Samuels, director of the SWC, said he was 'shocked to discover the . existence of a village in France officially called 'Death to Jews'. Referring . to the Second World War Nazi Occupation and the French collaborator . government, Mr Samuels added: 'It is extremely shocking that this name . has slipped under the radar in the 70 years that have passed since . France was liberated from Nazism and the Vichy regime.' Local police and the national railway, the SNCF, assisted the Nazis during the Holocaust, which saw about 76,000 French Jews murdered. Many more were persecuted in major cities, including Paris, where 'round-ups' were regularly carried out by the Nazis. But the deputy mayor of the village of Courtemaux - population 289 - which has jurisdiction over 'La-Mort-aux-Juifs', said nobody had anything to be ashamed of. 'It's ridiculous. This name has always existed,' said Marie-Elizabeth Secretand, in an interview with France's national news agency, AFP. 'No one has anything against the Jews, of course. It doesn't surprise me that this is coming up again.' History: Local police and the national railway, the SNCF, assisted the Nazis during the Holocaust, which saw about 76,000 French Jews (pictured) murdered . Changing the name would require a decision by the municipal council, and Ms Secretand said this was unlikely to be successful. 'Why change a name that goes back to the Middle Ages or even further?,' she said. 'We should respect these old names. 'A previous municipal council, at least 20 years ago, already refused to change the name of this hamlet, which consists of a farm and two houses.' The Israeli offensive against Gaza, in which hundreds of civilians including young children have died, has led to claims of increased anti-Semitism in France. Others say that the increasing electoral success of the far-right National Front, whose founder Jean Marie Le Pen is a convicted anti-Semite, is another reason why Jews are feeling unsafe. There are currently around 500,000 Jews in France, but many are expressing a desire to emigrate to places where they will feel more secure. Castrillo Matajudios - which means 'Castrillo Kill Jews' - is a Spanish village which voted to change its name in May.","Small settlement has been named La-Mort-aux-Juifs since the Middle Ages .

"A video blog famous for filming a brain cancer surgery may have proof in a recent post that dogs can detect humans having nightmares. In the video posted online, Charles Trippy says that whenever wife Alli Trippy has a bad dream, their two dogs jump on the bed and lay with her – one at her head and one at her feet.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Her protector: The Trippy's dog Zoe is shown lying with Alli Trippy as she wakes up from a nightmare . ‘Alli had a bad dream, and I think Zoe heard it, and she freaked out and went up there by her head,’ he said. ‘Who says dogs don’t have feelings?’ Charles Trippy, a bassist for rock group We The Kings, then says the other dog, Miley, is at wife Alli’s feet ‘in case she farts.’ Miley, apparently in desperate need of attention, then climbs over the sleeping woman to Zoe and licks the inside of the dog’s mouth while it yawns. ‘Here to screw everything up,’ the bassist says to the dog. 'You're such a spaz': The Trippy's other dog soon comes over looking for attention . Not amused: Zoe yawns at Miley's antics as Alli rubs her ears . The brain cancer survivor can be heard throughout the video  talking to the dogs and trying to get Miley to move. ‘Miley’s here to just mess everything up,’ Charles Trippy says, as the dog playfully growls. ‘The camera needs to be on me at all times guys,’ the musician says as Miley looks at him and makes a loud noise, waking up his sleeping wife. ‘You’re such a spaz,’ he says to the dog. Happy family: The Trippys pictured with both dogs . The discussion: The couple talks about Charles' brain tumor and his diagnosis, on the blog of course . Despite the commotion caused by Miley, Zoe lays there, almost motionless while Alli Trippy pets her head as she slowly wakes up. The dog then forces Zoe to move and is on Charles Trippy’s pillow licking itself while his wife rubs its belly. The dog then scratches its ear and licks its foot, to which the guitar player says ‘that’s gross, that’s all your ear wax you’re licking.’ The video is one of over 1,700 uploaded over the last five years to the couple’s video blog, which is updated every day.

"Revelations: in a bombshell email to the MoS Sir Richard Dearlove threatened to reveal new details behind the 'dodgy dossier' scandal . A former head of MI6 has threatened to reveal explosive new details behind the ‘dodgy dossier’ scandal if he objects to the long-awaited findings of the Chilcot Inquiry into Britain’s role in the Iraq War. Sir Richard Dearlove, 68, who provided intelligence about Saddam Hussein’s Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) that was apparently ‘sexed up’ by Tony Blair’s Government, has spent the last year writing a detailed account of events leading up to the war. He had intended to keep his work under lock and key and made available only to historians after his death. But now Sir Richard has revealed to The Mail on Sunday that he could go public after the Chilcot Inquiry publishes its findings. Sir Richard is expected to face censure from the inquiry’s chairman, Sir John Chilcot, over the  accuracy of intelligence provided by MI6 agents inside Iraq – which was used in the so-called ‘dodgy dossier’. In a bombshell email to the Mail on Sunday, Sir Richard, who is Master at Pembroke College, Cambridge University, disclosed: ‘What I have written (am writing) is a record of events surrounding the invasion of Iraq from my then professional perspective. ‘My intention is that this should be a resource available to scholars, but after my decease (may be sooner depending on what Chilcot publishes). I have no intention, however, of violating my vows of official secrecy by publishing any memoir.’ Sources close to Sir Richard say that while he accepts that some of MI6’s information on the WMDs was inaccurate, he insists that Chilcot should recognise the role played by Tony Blair and the Prime Minister’s chief spokesman Alastair Campbell in informing media reports which suggested Saddam could use chemical weapons to target British troops based in Cyprus – a claim which put Britain on a path to war in Iraq. Mr Blair and Mr Campbell have repeatedly denied making misleading statements about WMD. But Sir Richard is said to remain extremely aggrieved that this piece of intelligence, which his agents stressed only referred to battlefield munitions which had a much shorter range, led to media reports that UK bases were under threat. Last week it was revealed that Sir John had written to Prime Minister David Cameron informing him of his intention to write personally to those individuals he intends to criticise, with reports suggesting that Tony Blair is among those on Sir John’s list. Sir Richard has taken a sabbatical from his duties at Cambridge University to research and write his record of events. With his account nearing completion, he is expected to resume his Master’s role at the start of the new academic year. A security source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This is  Sir Richard’s time-bomb. He wants to set the record straight and defend the integrity of MI6. 'And Sir Richard has taken a lot of personal criticism over MI6’s performance and his supposedly too-cosy relationship with Mr Blair. In flames: British soldiers under attack in the Iraqi town of Basra in 2004 . ‘No Chief of MI6 has done anything like this before, but the events in question were unprecedented. ‘If Chilcot doesn’t put the record straight, Sir Richard will strike back.’ After graduating from Cambridge, Sir Richard began his MI6 career  in 1966 and was posted to Nairobi, Prague, Paris and Geneva before becoming head of station in Washington DC in 1991. He returned  to the UK two years later and became director of operations in 1994. He was appointed Chief, or ‘C’, in 1999. In his first year, the IRA fired a rocket at the agency’s headquarters on the South Bank of the River Thames. This was followed in September 2001 by Al Qaeda’s attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States. The Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee subsequently accused MI6 of failing to respond with sufficient urgency to warnings that Islamic fundamentalists were planning such a major terrorist attack. But last night the committee’s chairman, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who was appointed  in 2010, offered Sir Richard his support. Sir Malcolm told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have never heard of a former MI6 chief putting something out there in these terms but I would be interested in what Sir Richard has to say in response to the Chilcot Inquiry which is clearly going to have some meat in it. ‘I know Sir Richard and worked with him in the Foreign Office many years ago. He is a very able man of the highest character and a man  of his own opinions. We shall have to wait to see what he says.’ Sir Richard, who was elected Master at Pembroke just weeks after leaving MI6, lives in an  idyllic £1.2 million property in the college’s grounds. Last night, Alastair Campbell and the office for Tony Blair declined to comment on Sir Richard’s account.","Sir Richard Dearlove, 68 provided intelligence about Saddam Hussein's WMD .

"A 93-year-old man has been charged with 300,000 counts of accessory to murder for his role as an SS guard at Auschwitz concentration camp, prosecutors said today. A sergeant, Oskar Groening worked at the camp in German occupied Poland for two and a half years. Groening was charged with sorting the possessions of the inmates and collecting and tallying any money that was on them. A picture taken in January 1945 shows children in the Auschwitz concentration camp in Oswiecim . At least 1.1 million prisoners died at Auschwitz, around 90 per cent of them Jewish. In one period between May and June 1944, 425,000 Hungarian Jews went there and around 300,000 were immediately sent to the gas chambers. Hanoverian prosecutors said of Groening: ""He helped the Nazi regime benefit economically, and supported the systematic killings."" Groening's lawyer, Hans Holtermann, refused to comment on the charges. He was never punished after the war, a tribunal cleared him of involvement in 1948, but Groening who worked as the manager of a glass factory has openly talked about his time as a guard and said that he witnessed atrocities. The main gate of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz I,  near Oswiecim , Poland, which was liberated by the Russians in January 1945. Writing on the gate reads: Arbeit macht frei (Work sets you free - or work liberates) A group of SS officers gathered in front of a building at Solahutte, the SS retreat outside of Auschwitz, Poland. From left, Josef Kramer, Dr. Josef Mengele, Richard Baer, Karl Hoecker and an unknown officer . SS officers socialising in the grounds of their retreat, Solahutte outside of Auschwitz, Poland. From left, Dr Josef Mengele, Rudolf Hoess (the former Commandant of Auschwitz), Josef Kramer (Commandant of Birkenau), and an unknown officer . Nine years ago, he was interviewed by Der Spiegel and told the magazine of one incident when he heard a baby crying: ""I saw another SS soldier grab the baby by the legs... He smashed the baby's head against the iron side of a truck until it was silent. ‘On one night in January 1943 I saw for the first time how the Jews were actually gassed. It was in a half-built farmyard near to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. A gas chamber was built there. The women's barracks in the Auschwitz concentration camp in Oswiecim . All that remains: A pile of shoes from prisoners at the Auschwitz museum near former death camp Auschwitz . 'There were more than 100 prisoners and soon there were panic-filled cries as they were herded into the chamber and the door was shut. 'Then a sergeant with a gas mask went to a hole in the wall and from a tin shook Zyklon B gas pellets inside. In that moment the cries of the people inside rose to a crescendo, a choir of madness. These cries I have ringing in my ears to this day. Members of the SS Helferinnen (female auxiliaries) and SS officer Karl Hoecker sit on a fence railing in Solahutte eating bowls of blueberries in Auschwitz . 'It was completely understood by all that the majority were going straight to the gas chamber, although some believed they were only going to be showered before going to work. Many Jews knew they were going to die.' 'I made an application for a transfer and at the end of October 1944 I was shipped to the Belgian Ardennes where I served with a fighting unit until capture.' Groening, who lives near the Lueneburg Heath in Lower Saxony, is one of around 30 former Auschwitz guards who federal investigators recommended last year that state prosecutors pursue charges against under a new precedent in German law. Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler was buried in an unmarked grave at Lueneburg Heath after his suicide in May 1945, following his capture by the British. Groening is the fourth case investigated by Hanoverian authorities — two have been abandoned because the suspects are unfit for trial, and one was closed when the suspect died. Herr Holtermann said, however, his client is in good health. Thomas Walther, who represents 20 Auschwitz victims and their families as co-plaintiffs in the case against Groening as allowed under German law, said it's their last chance ""to participate in bringing justice to one of the SS men who had a part in the murder of their closest relatives."" ""Many of the co-plaintiffs are among the last survivors of Auschwitz.”","Oskar Groening was originally cleared of war crimes in 1948 .

"A new advertisement campaign telling men to 'man up, put on an apron' in order to 'give mums a night off' is under fire for pushing an outdated and sexist message. The intention behind New Zealand Pork's television and Facebook ads appear to have been to send up sexism, stating: 'there are more women in New Zealand's workforce today than ever before but men are still not putting on an apron and doing their share of cooking'.

But we know it ain't easy. So we've developed the world's first cooking website designed just for blokes.

Craig Johnson, 47, died after his Hyundai crossed a median and hit another car head on. His wife live-tweeted the event before realizing her husband was involved in the crash . Johnson, 41, a Salmon Creek mother of two and employee of T-Mobile, first heard about the car accident on Interstate 205 southbound moments after the crash over the police scanner on Wednesday afternoon. Commenting on the notorious stretch of road, Johnson says that she 'hates that section' of the highway because it has 'Too many on ramps, speeders and too few lanes.' The Columbian's staff photographer, Zachary Kaufman, who was at the scene of the collision and interacted with Johnson from the scene, updated his Twitter profile to say there was 'lots of debris on the roadway'. Retweeting this breaking news update from local newspaper the Columbian, Johnson announces that one person has died in what is confirmed as a two-car wreck she realizes was 'horrible'. Crash: While Craig Johnson died in his Hyundai the occupant of the overturned Toyota (seen left) is expected to survive . Retweeting the news that a helicopter had to land to rush the injured to hospital, Johnson begins to fret after around 10 tweets when she finds out that there has been a fatality at the scene. 'I'm trying not to panic, but my husband left work early and he drives 205 to get home. He's not answering his phone,' wrote Johnson to her Twitter feed. Sharing the news with her almost 1,000 strong following that her husband is also late, Johnson informs them that her husband suffers epilepsy and begins to speculate that his condition may have caused a crash. Her tweets become desperate after this as she implores her followers 'how long do I wait for him to come home before I call the police?' First response: Caran Johnson began tweeting to her followers just after 2 pm Pacific time - 5 pm Eastern time . Scanner: In her capacity as a police scanner enthusiast - Caran Johnson lets her followers know that the crash is awful . Horror: Caran Johnson learns that there has been a fatality at the crash scene - although she does not know yet it is her husband . Naturally, Johnson then tells her followers that she has become a 'basketcase' with worry after phoning her husband's work and being told that he left early because he was feeling faint. As Johnson became more and more frantic online, other Twitter users tried to console her. In a gut-wrenching moment over one hour after the crash, we are told her two children have come home - although Johnson has no idea where their father is. Then Johnson goes silent on Twitter for around 35 minutes. Creeping panic: Caran lets her followers know that her mind is racing after her husband fails to return home . Desperate: Caran tries to contact some of her Twitter sources at the Columbian police department to ask if the car could be her husband's Hyundai . Terror: Caran informs her followers that she is losing her cool amid her total panic at not hearing from her husband Craig . Sinking feeling: Caran still has not heard from her husband, even after calling his cell phone and his work . Hope: Caran even request advice from her followers who have been trying to comfort her . Caran waited no time at all calling the police who ominously told her that they would call her back . Sad: While it is not obvious how Caran was on the other side of a Tweet - this moment has poignancy considering what came next . Heartbreaking: This is the tweet that confirmed Caran's worst fears . Then, two hours after her first tweet, in a stark and matter-of-fact update, Johnson simply informs her followers that her husband, Craig, has indeed been named as the victim of the accident she was live-tweeting only one hour before with the words, 'It's him. He died.' The Washington State Patrol and Vancouver police confirmed that Craig R. Johnson, 47, was killed about 1:40 p.m. when his Hyundai Elantra . crossed the median and collided with a pickup truck. The truck driver . survived but was seriously injured. A woman who was driving the second car involved in the incident was taken to a . hospital with serious injuries, a broken femur and a collapsed lung. And in a stunning development that might bring some peace to Caran Johnson in her time of loss, a local woman, April Sturdevant tweeted Ms Johnson in a desperate bid to to pass on 'words of comfort'. Sturdevant said she had been at the scene of the accident and had been with Mr Johnson during his 'last breath'. It is not known if Johnson and Sturdevant have spoken since the accident. Not the end of the story: This Twitter user has come forward to tell Caran that they were with Craig when he died and that he felt no pain . Washington State Patrol spokesman Trooper Will Finn said that at the moment, 'We're not quite sure what's happened yet,' with regards to the crash. Indeed, Finn revealed to CNN the harrowing series of events that led to Johnson's terrible realization. He was at the accident scene where her husband, Craig, passed away and to his consternation, Johnson contacted him through Twitter - which the scanner enthusiast has done many times before. 'I may tweet something and she may tweet back. One night we exchanged a recipe for a low carb pizza,' said Finn, who has never met Johnson to CNN. At 2:20 p.m. PT, Johnson sent a tweet to Finn, '@wspd5pio do you have descriptions of involved vehicles?' '@ScanCouver sorry. Not yet.,' Finn replied. 'It was terrible,' the spokesman told CNN later. 'Immediately, I went into overdrive mode and I stopped tweeting the whole thing. I didn't want someone to find out over Twitter that their husband passed away. I didn't want her to find out that way. That is a hard thing to go through,' he said. In the normal course of events, Finn would post a picture of the crash scene, but this time he didn't in case Johnson recognized her husband's Hyundai. 'I feel terrible. I still feel terrible,' Finn said. 'Our hearts go out to the family. This person was a member of our community and we just lost him.'","Police scanner enthusiast Caran Johnson, 41, began live tweeting an accident outside of Vancouver, Washington around 2 pm Pacific time on Wednesday .

"Sixty per cent of the public believe immigration has damaged Britain, a major poll revealed last night. The study, commissioned by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, reveals widespread concern about the scale of immigration and its impact on jobs and public services. Just one person in six (17 per cent) believes that the advantages of immigration have outweighed the disadvantages. Ineffective: A government initiative to reduce immigration that was deemed unlikely to work . Many of the 20,000 people polled also reported direct experience of losing out to immigrants in the competition for a job or public services such as housing. Overall, it was identified as the second most important issue facing Britain after the state of the economy. Lord Ashcroft said the study revealed deep concerns about immigration, coupled with scepticism that any of the political parties would deal with the problem. ‘Many feel that over the past 15 years immigration has been allowed to happen on a scale we cannot cope with, and without public consent being sought or given,’ he said. ‘Politicians underestimated the size of the challenge, lost control of the situation, refused for too long to acknowledge that any problems might result, and are now struggling but failing to cope. ‘Most [of the public] do not feel there is any strategy for dealing with the number of migrants and their successful integration into British society, or for managing the effects on housing, infrastructure, jobs, the NHS, schools or the benefits system.’ More than three-quarters of people (77 per cent) said they supported a ‘drastic’ reduction in immigration, saying it would make it easier for British people to find jobs and reduce the pressure on public services. The controversial vans have been passing through Ealing, Barking and Dagenham, Hounslow, Redbridge, Brent and Barnet. Pictured - one of the billboards in Southall, West London . More than one-third (36 per cent) said that they or a family member had found it harder to get work because of competition from immigrants, and almost a quarter (24 per cent) said they or a family member had lost out to immigrants in the queue for council housing or other public services. Women were more hostile to immigration, with just 14 per cent saying immigration had been a good thing, compared to 21 per cent of men. And there were clear differences between supporters of the political parties. Some 62 per cent of Tory voters thought immigration had damaged Britain, compared to 48 per cent of Labour voters and 39 per cent of Lib Dems. Ninety-one per cent of UKIP voters said immigration was damaging Britain. The poll also identified differences in class attitudes towards immigration. David Cameron has pledged to cut net migration ¿ the difference between numbers entering and leaving Britain . Middle-aged working-class voters were far more concerned about the issue, with 90 per cent saying it was one of the biggest challenges facing the country. By contrast, graduates working in the public sector were likely to be far more positive about immigration, with 80 per cent saying it had benefited Britain. But the poll also revealed some more nuanced attitudes towards immigration. Some 83 per cent said they or a family member had been treated by NHS staff from overseas, and 49 per cent said immigrants were willing to do jobs that British workers do not want to do, with 38 per cent saying they also worked harder than their British counterparts. The poll also revealed deep public scepticism about the willingness of the government to deal with the problems produced by immigration. A controversial Home Office poster campaign warning illegal immigrants to ‘Go home or face arrest’ was supported by 79 per cent of people, but only 17 per cent think it will work while just 37 per cent of people think illegal immigrants already in the country are ever likely to face deportation. David Cameron has pledged to cut net migration – the difference between numbers entering and leaving Britain – to under 100,000 from non-EU countries by the time of the next general election in 2015. But, alarmingly for the Prime Minister, the study shows most people are not aware of government initiatives to bring about this reduction. The poll found that 76 per cent of people supported an annual cap on non-EU immigration but only 34 per cent knew it had taken place. There was also widespread support for other initiatives, such as cracking down on bogus colleges that grant places to immigrants pretending to be students, toughening requirements for immigrants to speak English and making it harder for people to bring in spouses from outside Europe, but in each case a majority of people was unaware that action had already been taken.","The study was commissioned by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft .

"The day before Mother's Day this year, police received a call from a wife frantic because her husband, who suffers Alzheimer's disease, had gone missing from the Little Rock, Arkansas home. Police found Melvin Amrine two blocks from their home, unable to tell officers where he lives. However, he wasn't confused as to where he was going: he was buying his wife Doris flowers for Mother's Day, as he had every year since she had given birth to their first child. Heart and mind: Alzheimer's sufferer Melvyn Amrine went on a mission to buy his wife Doris flowers on Mother's Day, and received a little help from officers who had been dispatched to find him . Melvyn Amrine has been slowly deteriorating since he was diagnosed with the condition three years ago. His wife has become her husband's carer, watching helplessly as the cruel disease steals her husband's memories and personality away from him. Officers radioed dispatch to say they would take the elderly man straight home - but Melvyn Amrine was having none of that. 'He was pretty adamant,' Officer Troy Dillard told CBS. Devotion: Although Melvyn Amrine can't remember whether he proposed to Doris or she proposed to him (it was the former), he did remember to do something he's done for her every Mother's Day since their first child was born: bought her a bouquet of flowers . Last love: The Amrines have been married for 60 years . 'He wasn't going home until he got those flowers,' Officer Brian Grigsby said. 'That's what he wanted. He wanted flowers for his wife, because tomorrow was Mother's Day.' So . the officers decided to help Melvyn Amrine achieve his goal, secretly . stopping in at a local supermarket and helping him select a bouquet of . beautiful cream-colored roses. 'We had to get those flowers,' Grigsby says. 'We had to get them. I didn't have a choice.' The kind officers even surruptitiously slipped the cashier some extra bills when Melvyn couldn't cover the tab. Adamant: Officers Grigsby (left) and Dillard (right) took a detour on the way to Melvyn Amrine's home to help him select some flowers for Doris . A frantic Doris Amrine was relieved when she saw her husband of 60 years walking up their front stairs in the company of the police officers, but her relief turned to joy when he presented her with the carefully selected bouquet. 'As he came up those steps, and I saw those roses and the smile on his face, I just broke inside,' Doris told CBS. 'I just said, ""Thank you, thank you."" Because I saw his heart.' 'It's special, because even though the mind doesn't remember everything, the heart remembers.'","Melvyn Amrine went missing the day before Mother's Day .

"Doughnut chain Krispy Kreme has apologised after bizarrely branding a half-term club KKK Wednesday - the same initials used by the US race hate group the Ku Klux Klan. A billboard at the Hull branch advertised the outlet's half-term Krispy Kreme Klub 'KKK Wednesday'. But after details appeared on social media the company faced complaints that the initials were the same as the racist group, the Ku Klux Klan. A Krispy Kreme doughnuts store in Hull came under fire after customers pointed out one of its half-term activities had taken the initials associated with the Ku Klux Klan . The Ku Klux Klan were a robed and hooded group known for violence against African Americans in the 19th and  20th centuries and still exists today. Krispy Kreme created KKK Wednesday  with the store in St Stephen's Shopping Centre, Hull as part of a calendar of activities designed to keep kids occupied during half term. But after posting the event on Facebook, readers were quick to point out the blunder. A member of staff at the Hull branch said the advertisement had been taken down. She said: 'We have now taken down the sign from our point of sale. We don't have a new name for the event yet but it is still going ahead this week.' The club will allow youngsters a chance to decorate their own doughnuts and also other activities. The store, based in the St Stephen's shopping centre in Hull (pictured), has since removed the advertising . The Krispy Kreme Klub hoped to allow children on school holidays to come to the store and decorate snacks . Krispy Kreme issued a formal apology and said: 'Krispy Kreme apologises unreservedly for the inappropriate name of a customer promotion at one of our stores. 'This promotion was never intended to cause offence. All material has been withdrawn and an internal investigation is currently under way.' The Ku Klux Klan was a racist organisation set up in Tennessee, southern USA in 1866 to resist plans to create racial equality. Believing in white supremacy, the group's members terrorised political leaders and campaigners, both back and white, who called for greater integration. Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest was the first leader, or 'grand wizard', and presided over a hierarchy of 'grand dragons', 'grand titans' and 'grand cyclopses'. Ku Klux Klan members in Virginia, USA. The group is now thought to have less than 5,000 members . Members wore white costumes with masks and conical hats designed to scare opponents and hide their identities. After dying out in the 1870s, the group was reformed around 1915 and took up the sign of the burning cross at rallies. Partly fuelled by fears over immigration from the First World War and Russian revolution in Europe, the group swelled to its largest ever size of around 4million members in the 1920s. Despite a slight resurgence during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, the group has slowly died away and is now thought to have fewer than 5,000 members.","Food chain planned to bring kids in with 'Krispy Kreme Klub' Wednesday .

"David Cameron vowed to crush Ed Miliband’s ‘1970s-style socialism’ yesterday as he put tax cuts, enterprise and opportunity at the heart of an election campaign to reprise the Tories’ defeat of Neil Kinnock. The Prime Minister condemned Labour’s ‘damaging, nonsensical, twisted economic policy’ and scoffed at what he called ‘Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy’ – saying it would heap ruin on Britain. In an annual conference speech shorn of policy gimmicks and rhetorical flourishes, he repeatedly asked voters to allow the Conservatives to ‘finish the job’ of turning Britain around. Scroll down for video . Fighting talk: Prime Minister David Cameron vowed to crush Ed Miliband's '1970s-style socialism' yesterday at the annual Tory conference . Land of opportunity: Cameron vowed to put tax cuts and enterprise at the heart of the Conservative election campaign . In other developments on the final day of the Tory conference in Manchester: . In his speech, the Prime Minister claimed the ‘land of hope is Tory’ while ‘the land of despair was Labour’. But in an echo of the 1992 election campaign, the last time the Tories won power outright, Mr Cameron signalled a relentless focus on Labour’s lack of credibility on the economy – attacking both Mr Miliband and Ed Balls. He spoke of wanting to create a ‘land of opportunity for all’ – an echo of slogans used by Margaret Thatcher in 1987 and John Major in 1992. Vow: Mr Cameron signalled a relentless focus on Labour¿s lack of credibility on the economy ¿ attacking both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls . Hope: In his speech, the Prime Minister claimed the ¿land of hope is Tory¿ while ¿the land of despair was Labour¿ . The Conservatives have already announced that fuel duty is likely to be frozen until the election and pledged to introduce a £1,000 transferable tax allowance for married couples. Mr Cameron pointed out that the Government had also cut taxes for 25million basic-rate taxpayers by raising personal tax allowances. And in an indication that the Tory’s next manifesto will pledge to raise the tax allowance still higher, he declared: ‘We’re Tories, we believe in low taxes. And believe me – we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people.’ 'We're Tories, we believe in low taxes. And believe me – we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people.' David Cameron . Tory strategists believe Mr Miliband made a major blunder in his speech last week by shifting decisively to the Left, proposing 1970s-style price fixing in the energy market, state seizures of undeveloped land and penalties for businesses who fail to take on trainees. In his 50-minute address, Mr Cameron said Labour had comprehensively lost the economic argument and it was clear to all that the economy was ‘turning the corner’. He said: ‘There was a time when I’d look across to Ed Balls and he was shouting his head off, screaming that the economy was flatlining with such glee. 'But recently, it’s gone a bit quiet. Could it be because there was no double dip and the economy’s growing?’ Key note speech: Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha wave to crowds following his address . Mr Cameron said the last government had left behind a ‘casino economy meets the welfare society meets the broken education system’. Business, he pointed out, had already created 1.4million new jobs since the last election and must be helped, not deterred. ‘Profit, wealth creation, tax cuts, enterprise: these are not dirty, elitist words – they’re not the problem, they are the solution, because it’s not government that creates jobs, it’s businesses. ‘You don’t do this job to be popular. You do it because you love your country. I do the best I can.' David Cameron . 'I know that bashing business might play to a Labour audience. But it’s crazy for our country.’ Mr Cameron said he knew voters were asking whether the ‘struggle’ of the past few years of austerity had all been worth it. He said: ‘Here’s the honest answer: the struggle will only be worth it if we as a country finish the job we’ve started.’ To abandon deficit reduction now would throw away ‘all the progress we’ve made’, the Prime Minister insisted. ‘How did they [Labour] get us into this mess? 'Too much spending, too much borrowing, too much debt. And what did they propose last week? ‘More spending, more borrowing, more debt. Reprise: Mr Cameron's speech echoed a 1987 speech from then PM Margaret Thatcher . History repeating? The Tories last won an election outright with a similar sentiment - one that saw John Major's Conservatives beat off a challenge from Neil Kinnock's Labour Party . 'They have learned nothing – literally nothing – from the crisis they created.’ He dismissed Mr Miliband’s promises to cut the cost of living as ‘all sticking plasters and quick fixes’. Acknowledging spending cuts had been unpopular, Mr Cameron added: ‘You don’t do this job to be popular. You do it because you love your country. I do the best I can. 'Labour have learned nothing – literally nothing – from the crisis they created.' David Cameron . 'And for me it comes back to some simple things – country first, do what’s decent, think long-term.’ It was not enough simply to clean up Labour’s economic ‘mess’ and pay off the deficit, he said, the Conservatives wanted to ‘build something better in its place’. The Conservative leader also sought to march onto centre-ground territory, where his party has traditionally found it difficult to make inroads against Labour – promising to drive industrial regeneration in the North of England and positioning the Tories as the true defenders of the NHS. Listening: (left-right) Michael Gove, Theresa May, and George Osborne listen intently to Mr Cameron's speech . Support: William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Jeremy Hunt applaud following Mr Cameron's speech . After the scandal of the Mid-Staffordshire hospital trust, where hundreds of patients died, the Conservatives would take no lectures from Labour on the NHS, he said. He even praised the ‘noble calling’ of social work – promising to get more top-flight graduates into the profession. And the Prime Minister sought to assure Tory troops that he is fighting for a majority Tory government, not another power-sharing administration with the Lib Dems. John Cridland, head of the . Confederation of British Industry, said Mr Cameron had ‘sent out a . strong message about how vital British business is to the future . prosperity of people across the UK’. But Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher said: ‘There’s a cost-of-living crisis and he’s got nothing to say about it. ‘Rather . than standing up for hard-working people he has always puts a . privileged few first, prioritising a tax cut for those earning over . £150,000 while everyone else pays more.’ Mr Cameron was joined by wife Samantha on stage as his audience gave him a standing ovation. The . pair left the auditorium to the sound of Fleetwood Mac’s Don’t Stop . Thinking About Tomorrow, used by Bill Clinton during his successful . campaign in 1992. Focus: The Conservatives are already turning their attention towards the next election . Job done: Walking hand-in-hand with wife Samantha, David Cameron looks pleased with his speech as he shakes the hand of a supporter . Margaret Thatcher was the greatest peacetime Prime Minister Britain ever had, David Cameron said yesterday. Conservatives this year ‘said goodbye to one of our team,’ he told a packed hall at the party conference in Manchester. He hailed the achievements of the late Baroness Thatcher, who died in April this year. Greatest: Margaret Thatcher memorabilia on sale at this year's Tory Party conference . Mr Cameron said: ‘Margaret Thatcher made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad.’ He went on to list some of her many achievements: ‘Rescuing our economy, giving power to our people, spreading home ownership, creating work, winning the Cold War, saving the Falklands.’ He also revealed how he had sat next to her at dinner once and had been very nervous to speak to her. Mr Cameron asked her about her record and told how she had been ‘totally charming’ and had ‘put me at ease’. But when he asked the Iron Lady what she would do differently if she had her time in government again, she replied: ‘You know, I think I did pretty well the first time around.’ Mr Cameron added: ‘We can all agree with that and we can all agree with this – she was the greatest peacetime Prime Minister our country has ever had.’","The PM scoffed at what he called 'Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy'

"A seven-year-old boy battling brain cancer sacrificed his life to save his mother's by giving her his kidney. Chen Xiaotian was just five when doctors found a malignant tumour in his brain, months before his mother Zhou Lu, 34, contracted kidney disease. Despite early signs he would recover, the disease aggressively returned, and he was told he would not reach adulthood. Tragic: Zhou Lu, 34, reads to her terminally ill son Chen Xiatian, seven, who went blind with brain cancer . Decision: Zhou battled chronic kidney disease for two years before her son said 'I want to save you' The pair battled through together for two years. Eventually, Chen told his mother: 'I want to save your life'. Over time, both had become incredibly weak. Zhou needed dialysis treatment, while Chen required round-the-clock care. Towards the end, Chen lost his sight and became so weak he was bed-ridden, nearly paralysed. Before: The pair were inseparable and battled through their debilitating illnesses together for two years . Diagnosed: Chen was told he had a brain tumour aged five and despite early signs of recovery, it came back . Zhou grew increasingly weak, and needed a kidney transplant to survive, and Chen wouldn't let her refuse his . Grandma Lu Yuanxiu, 57, said: 'The doctors approached me rather than his mother because of the sensitive nature of the issue. 'They told me that my grandson would not survive but his kidneys could help his mother and also save two other lives as well. 'I discussed it with Zhou and she refused point-blank, she absolutely didn't want to hear any talk of that happening.' The little boy, who became near-paralysed towards the end of his life, said his wish was to help Zhou . Distraught: Zhou, pictured after her operation, said her only consolation was knowing that, if her son had to die, a part of him would always be with her . But Chen overheard the dilemma, and demanded that his mother let him save her. In tears, his mother agreed, saying that if her son was to die her only consolation was that part of him would live on in her. Doctors confirmed that the tissue match was perfect and when he died on April 2, he was quickly moved to the operating theatre where his kidneys and liver were removed and then donated to his mother and two other people. Grandma Lu Yuanxiu, 57, was the first person doctors approached to say they would have to make the decision . Doctors had not been sure Zhou would be able to live a normal life, but they say early results show Chen's kidney will give her a miracle recovery . The second kidney went to a 21-year-old girl and his liver to a 27-year-old man. Hospital spokesman Yi Tai said all three transplants were a success and that the youngster's death had allowed three others to survive and live normal lives. He said: 'The medical team held a brief moment of prayer and silence for the poor child before the transplant, I think it's fair to say there were very few dry eyes.'","Chen Xiatian, seven, diagnosed with brain tumour at age of five .

"Genius: Alan Turing, who certainly earned his stripes in the scientific world . For the first time experimental evidence has been put forward confirming great British mathematician Alan Turing’s theory of how biological patterns such as tiger stripes or leopard spots are formed. Turing, whose centenary falls this year, put forward the idea that regular repeating patterns in animals are generated by a pair of morphogens that work together as an ‘activator’ and ‘inhibitor’. Now researchers from King’s College in London have validated the famous code-breaker’s 60-year-old theory in tests that also advance regenerative medicine. To test the theory the researchers studied the development of the regularly spaced ridges found in the roof of the mouth in mice. Carrying out experiments in mouse embryos, the team identified the pair of morphogens working together to influence where each ridge will be formed. These chemicals controlled each other’s expression, activating and inhibiting production and therefore controlling the generation of the ridge pattern. The researchers were able to identify the specific morphogens involved in this process – FGF or Fibroblast Growth Factor, and Shh, which stands for Sonic Hedgehog – so-called because laboratory fruit flies lacking the fly version have extra bristles on their bodies. Cat's amazing: Tigers have stripes because of the behaviour of specific morphogens . Turing was one of the great unsung heroes of World War II. He broke the German military's secret codes - created using the famous Enigma machine - that helped British Intelligence stay one step ahead of Hitler, allowing the Navy to defeat his U-boats and win the Battle of the Atlantic. Turing's work even laid the foundation for the creation of modern computers, leading Time magazine to name him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. 'Everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a wordprocessing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine,' it said. But Turing was shamefully ignored by the British Establishment, and then killed himself in 1954 after being convicted of being a homosexual and forced to undergo hormone therapy. They showed that when these morphogens’ activity is increased or decreased, the pattern of the ridges in the mouth palate are affected in ways predicted by Turing’s equations. For the first time the actual morphogens involved in this process have been identified and the team were able to see exactly the effects predicted by Turing’s 60-year-old speculative theory. Dr Jeremy Green from the Department of Craniofacial Development at King’s Dental Institute said: ‘Regularly spaced structures, from vertebrae and hair follicles to the stripes on a tiger or zebrafish, are a fundamental motif in biology. T . 'There are several theories about how patterns in nature are formed, but until now there was only circumstantial evidence for Turing’s mechanism. Our study provides the first experimental identification of an activator-inhibitor system at work in the generation of stripes – in this case, in the ridges of the mouth palate. ‘Although important in feeling and tasting food, ridges in the mouth are not of great medical significance. However, they have proven extremely valuable here in validating an old theory of the activator-inhibitor model first put forward by Alan Turing in the 50s. ‘Not only does this show us how patterns such as stripes are formed, but it provides confidence that these morphogens (chemicals) can be used in future regenerative medicine to regenerate structure and pattern when differentiating stem cells into other tissues. ‘As this year marks Turing’s centenary, it is a fitting tribute to this great mathematician and computer scientist that we should now be able to prove that his theory was right all along!’ Results of the study were published this week in Nature Genetics.",Alan Turing's 60-year-old theory is validated .
"Parents have attacked a 'disgusting' new television advert for a life insurance company - which appears to show a monster urinating on a customer in a bath. The bizarre TV campaign for Beagle Street life insurance was given a restriction preventing it from being shown around children's programmes. It was, however, broadcast numerous times during the day and in the early evening leading to more than 50 complaints made to the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA). The advert was shown on a number of channels, including during a showing of movie About A Boy on ITV and Gogglebox on Channel 4 as well as on Comedy Central, STV and the History Channel. The advert starts with a man reading a newspaper as he takes a relaxing soak in the tub. But two seconds in, a monster appears and turns on a tap between his legs before spraying a jet of water at the shocked man's face. Scroll down for video . The bizarre ad for Beagle Street life insurance shows a man soaking in the bath before a monster appears . Two seconds into the 30-second advert, the large gremlin-like creature  turns on a tap between his legs . Parents blasted the ad for being shown before the watershed as it appears to show a man being urinated on . The gremlin then roars, scaring the customer into leaping out of the bath as a voiceover says: 'Life insurance can be a bit of a nightmare.' A few seconds later, the monster suddenly explodes - sending fluff all over the man - before turning into a cute Furby-like character. The voiceover then comes back in, adding: 'But Beagle Street is different. A simple, friendly life insurance service online.' The new smaller creature then says 'Hello Roger, little back rub?' before the 30-second advert ends with the company website. Beagle Street say it is aimed at engaging with a new generation of customers who don't have or understand life insurance. The campaign, launched by advertising company The Corner London, who describe it as 'a cheeky dig at the old way of life insurance'. But furious parents blasted the company and said the 'disturbing' advert - called 'Life insurance. Reborn' - had given their young children nightmares. One said: 'I don't have problems with ads but this one is really freaking out my four-year-old nephew who has stopped the family from turning the TV on. 'He doesn't even have a bath because he's too frightened of the gremlin jumping out in the bath. 'He is screaming and won't go up to bed in time, he takes his mum up to bed at 8pm with her and won't let anyone switch television on at all.' The campaign aims to engage with a new generation of customers who don't have or understand life insurance . In a strange turn of events, the monster disappears leaving feathers and a Furby-like creature in its place . Another parent added: 'This advert is not suitable for daytime viewing. My two-year-old son cries as soon as it starts now and we have to act quickly to turn the channel over. 'Whoever came up with this advertising campaign clearly does not have children and in my view has completely driven away families from ever using their services. 'It should not be shown in the daytime or even at all as it's a ridiculous advert for the product it is attempting to promote.' One disgusted view said: 'It is a horrible advert, totally repellent, and I do not understand why anyone would be compelled to buy life insurance from this company. 'Also, although I do see that the monster in the corner is squirting water from the tap at the man in the bath, it looks like he is weeing on him. 'This one ought to be banned - or limited to The Horror Channel.' Another parent fumed: 'My two-year-old experienced terrible nightmares after seeing this advert. 'Kids do not need to see this kind of advertising and to be honest, most adults don't need to either. Ban it please.' Viewers also took to social media to express their disgust. Sarah Sanderson wrote on Twitter: 'It's 8.10pm and that stupid #BeagleStreet advert has come on. Surely it's a tad scary for kids? (Mine is in bed!)' Alisha Mann added: 'What is with that beagle street ad??? its gross and disturbing, makes me feel sick #BeagleStreet #grossedout' And Kirsty Boden said: 'Just witnessed THE sketchiest life insurance ad ever... Scarred! #beaglestreet' The Advertising Standards Agency received 55 complaints and others took to Twitter to express their disgust . Defending the campaign, Neil Simpson, founding partner of The Corner London, said: 'There are so many barriers to life insurance at the moment, hence the need for a simplification. 'We believe the campaign is altogether very un-life insurance in a good way.' On their website, the advertising company say: 'Our launch campaign takes a cheeky dig at the old way of life insurance and introduces the cutest of characters that is the embodiment of Beagle Street...life insurance reborn.' The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) confirmed they had received 55 complaints about the advert. They also revealed the campaign had been given an ex-kids restriction by Clearcast - meaning it shouldn't be broadcast around programmes that appeal to children. A spokesperson for the ASA said they were looking into the complaints to see if the advert should be investigated. They added: 'Generally complaints about the ad have said it is offensive and inappropriate for children. 'This ad has been shown at a variety of times during the day and early evening. 'The ad was given an ex-kids restriction by Clearcast. An ex-kids restriction means that it should not be broadcast in or around programmes with particular appeal to children. 'This means it could appear at any time of the day, but shouldn't appear during ad breaks for kids programmes. 'We are currently investigating these complaints to see if the ad should be investigated.'","Advertising Standards Agency got 55 complaints about Beagle Street advert .

"A New York man whose wife died just shy of their golden anniversary celebrated the special date anyway with a giant highway billboard. Joe Mikolajczak of Buffalo contracted for the sign around the couple’s 49th anniversary. When his wife Marylou died five months before it was slated to go up, he decided just to let it go ahead. ‘It was just my way of saying “I love you,”’ he said. Bittersweet: Joe Mikolajczak's wife died just five months shy of their golden anniversary. Though he'd arranged for the sign a year earlier and could have cancelled, he chose to celebrate their 50 years of love anyway . Mikolajczak intended to make the big statement no matter what. He even knew he could have gotten a refund had he so chosen. ‘About . a week before she died, I told her what I was going to do, and all she . did was look at me and tell me I'm nuts,’ he said. ‘But she was worth . it. I wanted her to have some sort of recognition.’ The elegant sign depicts the lovely Marylou at their wedding in 1963 as well as more recently. The touching words on the sign above I-190 South read: ‘I will love you forever, Joe.’ 'You got to inject some kind of, let's say levity, into the marriage': Mikolajczak says he often surprised his wife during their nearly 50 years of marriage . ‘I miss her every day. I cry every day. I cry every night, and I should cry,’ Mikolajczak told WGRZ. ‘Like I said, she was a beautiful woman inside and outside.’ The sign was evidently changed, if just a bit, to reflect Marylou’s passing. Instead of the dates of their wedding and anniversary, the sign shows the years of her birth and death, 1944 to 2013. Marylou was 68 when she died just five months shy of the hallmark year. Throughout their nearly 50 year marriage, Mikolajczak says surprises like the billboard were typical for him. 'You got to inject some kind of, let's say levity, into the marriage. Just to see her smile was worth it to me,' he said.","Joe Mikolajczak of Buffalo, New York could have gotten a refund after his wife Marylou died before their golden anniversary but decided to keep it ."
"A decorator has painstakingly recreated his former home to help his wife in her battle with dementia. Matt Muircroft recently moved back to Scotland with wife Julie, 75, after she was diagnosed with the illness. The couple had lived in Berkshire for 30 years but returned to their home town of Motherwell, Lanarkshire, to be closer to their family. Matt Muircroft was worried that his wife, Julie, would be upset by moving from her normal surroundings when they moved house. So, he decorated their new flat in exactly the same way as their old one. Image shows the couple in their old flat before Mrs Muircroft's illness . Mr Muircroft, a retired decorator, painstakingly recreated the couple's old home and he says it was the most important job he has ever done. The couple are pictured in their new home . When Mr Muircroft, 75, was told that any big changes in surroundings can cause anxiety in dementia sufferers he set about making the interior of their new flat an exact replica of their old one. During his career, Mr Muircroft worked in Windsor Castle and decorated St George’s Chapel in the grounds of the castle for the wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999. However, the father-of-six told how his most recent makeover was the most important job of his life. He said: ‘Julie was diagnosed with dementia in 2009 and we moved back to Motherwell in May to be near our close family for extra support. ‘We have also received great support and advice from the charity Alzheimer Scotland. ‘One of the things we were told initially was that big changes in surroundings can create confusion and anxiety if someone is affected by dementia. ‘I had a long, hard think about what I could do to make the transition as seamless as possible for Julie. ‘It seemed like one of the most obvious things to do would be to use the skills of my trade to help.’ Mr Muircroft even placed the couple's photographs and ornaments in the same position as they occupied in their old flat . From colour scheme to skirting, fireplace to fittings, the decor of the flat has been painstaking replicated from their former home, also a flat. He also placed ornaments and family photographs in the exact same position as they were in the couple’s previous home. Mr Muircroft said: ‘Recreating the . interior has really helped Julie settle and without a doubt it’s been . the most important job of my life. ‘Caring . for Julie and helping her cope with the changes the condition has . brought, by doing anything I can, has become my sole focus.’ Arlene Crocket, of Alzheimer Scotland, . said: ‘To move to a new environment can be very unsettling for some . people affected by dementia and can sometimes exacerbate confusion. Mr Muircroft said: 'I had a long, hard think about what I could do to make the transition as seamless as possible for Julie. It seemed like one of the most obvious things to do would be to use the skills of my trade to help' Mr Muircroft said: 'Caring for Julie and helping her cope with the changes the condition has brought, by doing anything I can, has become my sole focus.' Image show the outside of their building in Motherwell . ‘That’s why having as much familiarly as possible in a new environment is really important. Items like ornaments, photographs and paintings from a previous setting can help in many cases. ‘What Matt has done, by making the new flat almost identical to his last home, really is a moving example of someone going the extra-mile for a loved one.’ Alzheimer Scotland, which are continuing to help Mr Muircroft care for his wife by offering advice and support, are playing a key role in the nationwide Reshaping Care for Older People (RCOP) programme. RCOP aims to help growing numbers of older people over 65 to continue to live full, positive and independent lives in the community. RCOP partners in Lanarkshire, who also include NHS Lanarkshire, North and South Lanarkshire Council the voluntary and independent sector, are also focussed on recognising and supporting unpaid carers, like Mr Muircroft.","Matt Muircroft worried Julie would be anxious when they moved house as he knew people with dementia can be upset by changes to surroundings .

"A 7-year-old Chinese boy dying from cancer and abandoned by his mother says he wants to see her one more time before he loses his sight. Ren Shihao, who has a brain tumour, told a local reporter in China's southwestern Sichuan province that he doesn't blame his mother for leaving the family, but added: 'I want to say I miss her. I want to say I love you mum. And I want her to hug me.' Ren can only see a few centimeters in front of his face as the growth puts pressure on his optic nerves. Ren Shihao's mother left the family before the 7-year-old was diagnosed with brain cancer but now refuses to come back as she has a new life with a different man. Here local volunteers play with Ren . The boy was diagnosed with cancer in September after his father, Cheng Li Ren, 35, took him to hospital when he began to feel ill. Cheng said: 'I took him to the hospital where they diagnosed him as suffering from a medulloblastoma, a kind of malignant cancer on the brain, in September. 'He had been feeling ill from September and in May he began to stagger. But hospital visits are hard for us to manage, we only took him there in September and the cancer was diagnosed. Doctor's in the regional capital of Chengdu operated on the growth, but by then it had already spread too far. Despite the tragic events Ren says he doesn't blame his mother for leaving but would like to see her one last time before the tumour robs him of his sight. Local well-wishers are helping him to make a video appeal . Ren's can only see a few centimeters in front of his face as the growth puts pressure on his optic nerves but maintains hope of seeing his mother again so he can hug her and tell her he loves her . After the failed operation Ren was sent back to his home in Yangyi village where local hospitals said they couldn't do anything for him and sent him home. His father added: 'He is starting to lose his sight, he thinks he will go blind, but he does not know he will die eventually. He wants only one thing, to see his mother before he loses his sight.' Ren's mother, Li Sun, left the household after arguments about money following his birth. Both parents had been forced to leave their village to work in the city, and Ren was raised by his grandmother, Zhao Yonglian. But the strain that put on the relationship was too much, and eventually Li kissed him goodbye and left. Cheng has since tracked her down, but she is in a new relationship and refuses to come back to see her dying child. He said: 'I never married her, and I left my son and managed to track her down, and discovered she now has a new life with a new man where she is married, so she has refused to come and see her son that we had. 'I guess her new family do not know of her previous life.'","Cheng Li Ren and Li Sun had son Ren Shihao outside marriage .

"A British man is now claiming Scotland's proudest creation: Whisky. Entrepreneur Daniel Szor will soon begin creating whisky - more than 500 miles from one of the homelands of whisky - Glenmorangie . Entrepreneur Daniel Szor, 51, plans to produce ultra-premium, small batch single malt whisky from his plant in the Cotswolds. By 2017, visitors to the area could be enjoying a glass of Cotswolds Single Malt - for the price of £44.95 per bottle. By then, Mr Szor aims to have his first run of 5,000 'single estate' bottles ready. Yet three years before the launch, he is already taking orders of the whisky. Mr Szor is renovating two Cotswolds stone buildings at Stourton, near Shipston, in Warkwickshire to equip as the distillery, tasting rooms and offices. He has also imported a Scotsman to help him with the job - master distiller Harry Cockburn and a wood and ageing consultant, Jim Swan, has also been brought on board. As well as whisky, the distillery will also make dry gin and a range of brandies and liqueurs made from local fruits and berries. By September this year, Mr Szor hopes to begin producing his first bottles and in the summer of 2015 gin from the distillery will go on sale. The distillery will also create a rye whisky called Traitor's Ford Rye after a local landmark associated with the English Civil war. Mr Szor said:'We are excited to be creating an adventurous new landmark for the region and for English whisky.' The idea was born out of a passion for single malt. 'I was very much charmed by the Scottish and their production. 'I really didn't want to sit behind a desk any more so I thought to myself 'what else can I do?' 'I just happened to be looking out of the window at our Cotswolds house and I saw a beautiful field full of barley and thought I could distil that,' he said. And all of the ingredients used in the distillery will be from the Cotswolds. The businessman bought his first cast of the spirit in 2002, at the newly reopened Bruichladdich distillery on Islay. Over time, Daniel, who is originally from New York, watched a number of whisky distilleries open, and grow from strength to strength, inspiring him to start his own operation. The label on the bottles will read: 'Established 2013, single malt whisky'. Each bottle will be decorated with a pheasant . A new home for whisky: the Cotswolds. Mr Szor is pictured here in front of the stone buildings in Stourton, Warwickshire. Soon, bottles of Cotswolds single malt will begin being released from behind these doors . He plans to use locally sourced ingredients in his production, and has already pre-purchased 20 tonnes of barely from a nearby farm. Cotswolds water will also feature as one of the main ingredients, and bottles of both single-malt and gin will be finished off with speciality water bought in from Blenheim, Oxfordshire. But although Scotland is the country behind whisky, Mr Szor said he does not find its reputation for the drink intimidating, instead, he plans to follow the Scottish lead. Mr Szor aims to have his first 5,000 bottles of Costwolds Single Malt ready by 2017 . The distillery will also make dry gin and a range of brandies and liqueurs made from local fruits and berries . From the Warwickshire site, he hopes to produce around 120,000 bottles of whisky a year. He said: 'I never forget for a day what good quality drinks are being made just a couple of hundred miles north of us. 'What we put out in a year will be what the medium Scottish firms put out in a day or two. 'We are looking to build a reputation regionally, to us Scotland is not intimidating, it is a road to follow. 'I see a lot of people who want to go off and do their own thing, but I'm in this to make a product, I need to be able to sell my second bottle as well as my first.' The Szor family is funding the project alongside the Cotswolds Distillery Founders Circle - which is offering interested investors an opportunity to take part. Scottish version of the spirit is spelled without an 'e' the Irish version takes an 'e' The spirit is distilled and made with cereals, yeast and water . Comes from the Gaelic 'uisge beatha', or 'usquebaugh', meaning 'water of life' Since 2007, legally, Scotch Single Malt Whisky must be produced in Scotland .

Whisky . does not mature, no matter how long it is kept for. For example, a . 10-year-old whisky does not become a 50-year-old whisky if kept for 50 . years . Different grains can be used for the spirit: Barley, rye, corn, maize . The process: First the whisky is malted, which means sugar is extracted from barley and turned into alcohol using yeast. Next, the malt is ground and hot water is added . The product is distilled - which means that the liquid is heated to the correct temperature. With whisky the process usually happens twice . Liquid is then stored and matured in oak casks . The whisky is then blended and bottled . Hundreds of miles away in Fife, another unlikely entrepreneur has had a bright idea: to create the first bottle of Scottish wine. In September, in Upper Largo, some 40 miles from Edinburgh, weather dependant, Scotland's first grapes will be harvested. Meanwhile in Fife: Christopher Trotter will soon be selling bottles of Chateau Largo from grapes grown some 30 miles from Edinburgh . By summer 2015, Christopher Trotter, the man behind the Scottish wine, will be enjoying a bottle of Chateau Largo - created off the A197. Chateau Largo will be a medium dry white wine - with a similar taste to Chardonnay or Riesling. The project of bringing wine to Scotland began with a throwaway comment when a friend of Mr Trotter's said that if climate change continued, Fife would be the same temperature as the Loire valley within 20 years. Thanks to another friend who supported the project financially, Mr Trotter was able to bring 100 vines from Ryedale  in North Yorkshire to Scotland. He is growing three grape varieties: Solaris, Siegerrebe and Rondo - all of which originate from Germany. The grapes were chosen because they can all be harvested in September before temperatures drop. The plot is a six acre site, with a south-facing slope overlooking the North Sea, where, Mr Trotter says the sunshine is 'fantastic'. Last July the average temperature in Fife was 21.4 degrees. This morning however, the temperature is just 7 degrees and the humidity is 76 per cent. But according to Mr Trotter the plot's location is key to the wine's success - there are no hills blocking the sun and drainage to get rid of the rain. Mr Trotter has high hopes for the British wine industry. If the wine is a success, he hopes to attract an investor who will help finance planting 5,000 vineyards and produce 15,000 bottles of wine a year.","Daniel Szor will distil Cotswolds Single Malt in Stourton, Warwickshire .

"A Californian company has created 'sensual enhancement oil' (pictured) for women made from a mixture of coconut and cannabis oils . Cannabis is said to heighten your sense of smell and taste, and now it could boost sexual pleasure too. A Californian company has created ‘sensual enhancement oil’ for women, which is made from a mixture of coconut and cannabis oils. And it claims the oil can result in a ‘high’ for some users. Foria can be ingested or applied topically, to ‘create the relaxation needed for sensual experience’ and possibly multiple orgasms. While it can result in some users getting high, Aphrodite Group – the medical marijuana collective that sells the potion – said the majority of women who use it do not experience that feeling, but instead are more relaxed. ‘The psychoactive effects of getting ""high"" when taken orally are consistent with other edible medical marijuana products,’ it explained. The formula was inspired by the historical use of cannabis as an aphrodisiac in traditional cultures around the world. ‘For some women, it may awaken arousal and heighten sensation making orgasms more intense, fuller, or easier to access,’ Foria’s makers claim. ‘For others, it can help promote natural lubrication, reduce pain and tension and create the relaxation necessary for sensual experience, or restorative rest.’ The mixture is not designed to be used like a standard lubricant, but is designed to be applied at least half an hour before sex. This time allows for the active compounds of the drug to be fully activated and absorbed, the collective said. The formula of the lubricant was inspired by the historical use of cannabis (stock image of the plant is pictured) as an aphrodisiac in traditional cultures around the world . While men can also use it, the lubricant . is intended for women because the membrane of the vagina is more . sensitive and absorbent. 'Introducing medicines, compounds and different drugs through the vagina is something that both modern doctors and doctors throughout history have done,' Matthew Gerson, creator of Foria told Nerve. 'Women report a sense of embodiment, a sense of dropping into a more full relationship to sexual sensations and sensations around the body. 'As you can imagine, as that builds up to orgasm - if orgasm is a part of your experience - then that can lead to intensification and a more full body experience,' he continued. Some women who have used the product reported tingling as well as increased warmth and relaxation. Others had multiple orgasms, but some found the lubricant helped them fall asleep. The potion costs $88 for 1oz (30ml) or $24 for 5ml, but it is currently only available to residents of California who have a letter from their doctor, or a medical marijuana card. It is not clear whether the potion will be made available outside of the state, and MailOnline has contacted the company for more information. Yes!

"Former Conservative candidate Nick Morris (pictured) has quit the party after calling a group of feminists 'left-wing lesbo groupies' on Twitter . A former Conservative candidate has resigned from the party after calling a group of feminists 'left-wing lesbo-groupies' on social media. Nick Morris, who describes himself as a Conservative 'activist', went on to call them 'cretins' in a later tweet. He made the comments in response to a post by feminist campaigner @LiraelClayr who was tweeting about a campaign against male violence towards women. In the tweet, Mr Morris, who stood as a Conservative candidate for Sheffield Richmond in the 2004 Sheffield City Council elections said: 'Frankly I really dont care what you and leftwing lesbo-groupies think.'[sic] . He later posted: 'From what dark hole have these cretins crept from I wonder.' His remarks were made in relation to a project called 'Counting Dead Women' run by feminist Karen Ingala Smith that produces information about the number of women in the UK killed by their partners or sons. Last week she launched her Femiside Census: Profiles of Women Killed by Men - which records details of all the women murdered by men in Britain. Twitter user @LiraelClayr, who wished to remain anonymous, told MailOnline: 'The tweet was offensive, but I wasn't overly surprised as I tend to receive a lot of abuse on Twitter. 'The direct leap to calling a group of woman ""lesbos"" in my opinion was an attempt to diminish our words as if it was a shameful thing to be. 'Although I myself am not a lesbian, others included are and found it even more offensive as is their right. 'The gentleman apologised to me the next day and donated to a charity in way of that apology. I accepted the apology for myself but told him that others would accept or not accept as is their right. 'As far as I'm aware several people are still cross about it.' Following a backlash on Twitter, Mr Morris hastily deleted the offensive tweets and his account. He has since resigned from the party. Nikki Bond, Labour party councillor in Sheffield and an active feminist, said it was 'pretty appalling' He later issued a statement apologising for his remarks. He said: 'It was a very foolish tweet which I have apologised for. There was no justification for it whatsoever. 'I have since resigned from the Conservative Party and the lady in question has accepted my apology. 'I've made a donation to a charity of her choice. It was sent on the spur of the moment and it certainly doesn't reflect my views. I'm deeply ashamed about my comment.' Nikki Bond, a Labour party councillor in Sheffield and an active feminist, said: 'Unfortunately I'm all too familiar with this kind of attitude. 'For anyone to have that kind of attitude is pretty appalling but for someone in a political role, where people are looking up to them for guidance, it is really important they do not come out with this sort of language.'","Nick Morris, a Tory 'activist' has resigned from party after offensive tweets .

"A dog survived after being struck by a car then travelling 55 miles dangling from its bumper, it was reported today. Driver Julia Cesar Siqueira said he heard a thud after turning onto a road near his home in Itapetinga, northeastern Brazil. But the student, 35, carried on his hour-long trip towards the next town - unaware that the young mogrel was trapped inside the vehicle's front bumper grille. Terrifying: Rescuers help a dog after it was struck by a car and carried 55 miles while wedged in the front grille . It was only after arriving at his university campus in Vitoria de Conquista, Bahia state, that passers-by noticed the terrified animal and alerted him. Mr Siqueira, who was traveling with his mother and two fellow students, told Brazil's Globo G1 website: 'I saw the dog in the middle of the road and swerved to avoid it. 'But then I heard a thud, and realised I'd hit it. 'I was traveling at speed and knew it could have survived the collision, so I kept driving. It's quite a dangerous spot.' Arriving at his destination at around 8.30pm on Tuesday, Mr Siqueira noticed several people signalling for him to stop. Journey of terror: The mongrel's 55-mile ride from Itapetinga to Vitoria da Conquista . He said: 'There weren't any places to stop safely so I carried on and parked in front of the university. 'Someone told me there was a dog on the front of my car, so we went to look, imagining it was dead. 'We couldn't believe it when she appeared to still be alive and conscious. 'The force of the collision had smashed the front panel and she was trapped in the body of the car.' Firefighters and a local vet were called who rescued the animal, which was found to have a broken front leg but was otherwise unharmed. The bitch has now been christened Vitoria, which as well as being the name of the town, means 'Victory' in English. A spokesman for Vitoria da Conquista's 7th Fire Brigade confirmed they had freed the dog and that it was being cared for at a private veterinary clinic in the town. Mr Siqueira had agreed to pay all of the dog's treatment, the spokesman added.","Brazilian driver heard thud but was unaware mongrel was trapped in car .

"Playing classical music such as Beethoven and Mozart to young children boosts their concentration and self-discipline, a new study suggests. Youngsters also improve their general listening and social skills by being exposed to repertoires from composers including Ravel, Shostakovich and Mendelssohn. In addition, they are likely to appreciate a wider range of music in later years, according to a study from the Institute of Education, (IoE), University of London. Listening to classical music such as Beethoven (right) and Mendelssohn (left) boosts children's concentration and self discipline as well as improving their general listening and social skills, according to new research . Playing classical music to children boosts their concentration and self-discipline, according to the study. It improves their general listening and social skills. Children exposed to the works of Beethoven and Mozart, for example, are more likely to appreciate a wider range of music in later years. Some teachers involved in a scheme to expose seven to 10-year-olds to classical music reported seeing an improvement in their English. Another study found that musicians have sharper minds and are less likely to suffer a mental decline. Mastering instruments such as the piano, flute or violin improves people's ability to pick up mistakes and fix them quickly. Susan Hallam, professor of education and music psychology at the IoE, evaluated a programme developed by Apollo Music Projects which introduces children aged seven to ten to classical music and its composers. The scheme involves a whole school assembly followed by six lessons at class level, with children experiencing different instruments and musical concepts and a formal concert. Musicians explain what children should listen for and launch question and answer sessions. As the sessions progress, the listening tasks become more complex. The programme has been delivered to 4,500 children in 26 primary schools in Hackney and Tower Hamlets, East London, as well as to over 22,000 youngsters in assemblies and concerts. 26 members of staff and 252 children in nine primary schools were questioned about the programme. Teachers rated developing the ability to listen as the main benefit, followed by musical knowledge and development and the boosting of concentration levels, aspirations, self-discipline and personal and social skills. Some staff also pointed to improvements to English. Susan Hallam, professor of education and music psychology at the IoE, evaluated a programme developed by Apollo Music Projects which introduces children aged seven to ten to classical music and its composers. The scheme involves a whole school assembly like the one pictured (stock image) One teacher said: ‘The children really enjoy the sessions. I think that listening to music in such an intimate environment (ie the classroom) engages them and allows them to develop their listening skills.’ Another said that pupils’ communication skills improved. In a report on the scheme, Professor Hallam said children developed ‘enhanced listening skills and the development of other skills necessary for careful listening to take place including concentration and self-discipline’. She added: ‘For some of the children the programme was inspirational. The children’s positive reactions suggest that they were ‘open-eared’ and had not developed prejudices against classical music. ‘We know that preferences for music are affected by the extent to which individuals are exposed to them, the greater the exposure the greater the liking. ‘Opportunities to listen extensively to classical music in the early years of primary school are therefore likely to lead to children appreciating a wider range of music than might otherwise be the case.’ In another study, researchers said that mastering instruments such as the piano, flute or violin improves people's ability to pick up mistakes and fix them quickly. They perform tasks faster and do not allow occasional slip-ups to derail them due to their hours of practice . Mary Igoe, a former head teacher from Columbia Primary School, Bethnal Green, East London, who experienced the programme, said: ‘The skills of careful listening and differentiating musical sounds transfer to other areas of the curriculum and improve their (pupils’) ability to concentrate and attend to details.’ Meanwhile a study from the University of St Andrews, Fife, Scotland, last September suggested that musicians have sharper minds and are less likely to suffer a mental decline. Researchers said that mastering instruments such as the piano, flute or violin improves people's ability to pick up mistakes and fix them quickly. They perform tasks faster and do not allow occasional slip-ups to derail them due to their hours of practice. The study indicated that playing an instrument could protect against a deterioration in mental abilities through age or illness.","Playing classical music to young children boosts their concentration and self-discipline as well as their social skills .

"Ever feel like you’ve been hit on the head after a bad night’s sleep? According to scientists, the thought isn’t as far-fetched as it seems. A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a spike in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Being sleep deprived causes a similar change in the brain to that seen after a head injury - it results in a spike in the chemicals associated with brain injury . Professor Christian Benedict, of . Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemcials NSE and S-100B . are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion. He . said: ‘What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group . that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that . would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still . significant. The brain requires sleep to cleanse itself of toxic substances. A lack of sleep is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's . ‘During sleep, the brain cleans itself of toxic substances and NSE and S-100B increase in response to these substances.’ He said the findings back up previous research showing how the brain uses sleep to cleanse itself. Professor . Benedict also said his study could support previous studies which . linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s . and multiple sclerosis. The . rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not . getting enough sleep is conducive to a loss of brain tissue, he . explained. Professor . Benedict, whose study is published in the journal Sleep, added: ‘In . conclusion, the findings of our trial indicate a good night’s sleep may . be critical for maintaining brain health.’ A . third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while . the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared . with almost nine a few decades ago.

"An Italian clothing manufacturer has been accused of sexism after selling fashion items complete with washing instructions reading: 'Give it to your mum - it's her job'. Politician Federica Mazzoni, who works at the equality commission at the legislative assembly in the country's Emilia-Romagna region, was incensed when a friend bought a cardigan for her son from the Shoeshine clothing brand and found the offensive label. Ms Mazzoni, 28, has now lodged a formal complaint with Italy's advertising council the IAP - although the company that distributes Shoeshine clothing, Unipersonale, has dismissed the controversial washing instructions as 'a simple joke aimed at teenagers'. No joke: Beneath a list of ordinary washing instructions Democratic Party MP Federica Mazzoni found the English language instruction: 'Or give it to your mum, it's her job' Beneath a list of ordinary washing instructions including 'Machine wash cold' and 'Do not dry clean' the Democratic Party MP found the English language instruction: 'Or give it to your mum, it's her job'. Angry: Politician Federica Mazzoni, 28, has now lodged a formal complaint about the label . Posting a photo of the label onto Facebook, Mazzoni wrote: 'Doing the washing is not the mother's job, fathers are also capable of turning a simple knob. 'Obviously it wasn't enough for the company to provide all the necessary useful information, it felt the need to have its say, by perpetuating a sexist message about mothers and women, which is also insulting for men and fathers,' she added. 'It suggests women have no other skills than staying at home and that of turning a knob to 30...In a mirror image, it insults men as if they were not capable of doing a simple wash. 'Anyway, the cardigan is still in the wash basket.' Ms Mazzoni was joined in her criticism by Facebook friend Erica Zambonelli who posted: 'If one did not see it, one would not believe it. Crazy.' But Lorenzo Genovesi posted: 'It could be morally harmful for kids. Although I wonder how many youngsters will look at the label, as they probably leave it to their mums.' Responding to accusations of sexism, Shoeshine distributor Unipersonale dismissed the claims. 'There is no kind of sexist irony. It's just a simple joke aimed at teenagers who are our target,' the company said, a spokesman told Tgcom24.","Italian Politician Federica Mazzoni found label on a friend's son's cardigan .

"President Obama faced allegations of a major political cover-up last night over the resignation of CIA chief General David Petraeus, who had an affair with a married woman. Congress is expected to investigate claims that the affair was hushed up to protect Obama’s re-election campaign. It is believed the affair was discovered by the FBI months ago, but not made public until after the election. Disgraced: General Petraeus with his mistress Paula Broadwell . Cover-up? If it is discovered the Petraeus affair was kept quite so as to not disrupt Obama's Presidential campaign, Barack may face some tough questioning . A Woman Scorned? It is being claimed that the affair between David Petraeus and Paula Broadwell emerged after she sent threatening emails to Ms Kelley . The FBI began an investigation  in February after discovering the  60-year-old’s computer had been accessed by someone else - believed to be his 40-year-old mistress Paula Broadwell - prompting fears of a major security breach. This led to the discovery of hundreds of explicit emails including one referring to ‘sex under a desk.' A source said last night: ‘The real question is, what did the President know, and when?’ Frances Townsend, a former  senior US government security official and now a member of the CIA Advisory Committee, said: ‘Whenever the FBI opens an investigation of a senior official they have to make notification of that, especially if there is an intelligence concern. 'It is hard to believe the White House did not know about this prior to the election.’ Suffering: General Petraeus' wife of 37 years Holly, will be in shock over the revelations . White House officials insist the President did not know of the affair until last Wednesday, the day after the election. He accepted the retired four-star general’s resignation on Thursday, and the announcement was made on Friday. Some have alleged the scandal is a smokescreen to stop Petraeus testifying before a Senate committee this week into the deaths of the US ambassador and three staff members in September in Benghazi, Libya. The White House has been accused of ignoring repeated warnings of an Al Qaeda terrorist attack on the embassy. A senior Congressional staffer said last night: 'What would he have told us? The resignation is incredibly convenient for the administration. Would he have revealed the CIA knew the Benghazi compound was under threat and Washington did nothing to secure it?' Members of the House Intelligence Committee may still vote to subpoena Petraeus and force him  to testify. The source added: ‘This could be another Watergate situation where it is not the event that brings down the president but the cover-up.’ Mother-of-two Broadwell began an affair with Petraeus, married to his wife Holly for 37 years, when she was with him in Afghanistan in 2010 doing research for her biography, All In: The Education Of General David Petraeus. She says they ‘bonded’ over push-ups and five-mile runs in the deserts of Afghanistan. ‘That was the foundation of our relationship. He goes all in to what he does,’ she said.

"A 19-year-old Maryland woman who survived being shot by an ex-boyfriend has broken her silence with an emotional Facebook post just two weeks after the attack. Kristen Loetz first thanks both those who've helped her in her speedy recovery and CJ Abbott, the 19-year-old who died while protecting her from her attacker. Loetz then compassionately addresses Ryan Shallue, the angry high school flame who took his own life after forcing his way into her home near Salisbury University, shot her in the face, and murdered her heroic friend. Speaking out: Kristen Loetz (right) took to Facebook to speak for the first time since her jilted ex-boyfriend shot her in the face and murdered her friend who tried to protect her . 'Everyone needs to know how you saved my life that day,' writes the honors nursing student in her loving ode to CJ Abbott. Loetz had spent the 12 days previous recovering from wounds she incurred the night Shallue shot her and Abbott with a semi-automatic rifle before before going into a bathroom and shooting himself in the head. 'My fast recovery is greatly because of all of the love and support I have received from everyone,' Loetz writes. That support came first and foremost from Abbott, whose sister said he died a hero trying to stop Shallue from assaulting Loetz. 'I love ya ceej': Loetz thanks all her friends and family, but she gives extra thanks to the man who helped her keep her life but lost her own--CJ Abbott . 'Thanks for being my hero': Loetz wrote an emotional thanks to CJ Abbott, the 20-year-old who sacrificed himself to help save her life when ex Ryan Shallue pulled out a gun to exact his revenge . Haunting: As Shallue (left) lay dead, this photo of him with the woman he tried to kill remains on his Twitter account . 'It is so unfair that it was you and not me,' she writes. 'CJ, the most kind gentle hearted person who would jump at the chance to lend a hand to anyone.' Loetz writes of Abbott's 'fantastic family' and says 'one day I hope to meet them and tell them how amazing of a person I knew you to be.' 'I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for me,' she writes in a post dated September 15. Loetz goes on to thank the friend named Michelle 'for being so strong during this tragedy' and calling 911 after the shooting. Then Loetz writes something unexpected, a largely friendly acknowledgement of the ex-boyfriend who tried to kill her. 'You were never a bad person,' she writes of Shallue. 'I hope you have found a better place where you can find peace.' The 450 word letter closes: 'I love ya ceej, thanks for being my hero.' Police . say Ryan Shallue became increasingly disturbed after his high school . girlfriend Kristen Loetz, 19, dumped him four months ago. Shallue began stalking her and . bought a gun two weeks before the shooting. On the night of September 4, he showed up at Loetz's off-campus house, where she . discovered her with 20-year-old Charles 'CJ' Abbott. When Shallue began . fighting with Loetz, Abbott tried to intervene, police said. Shallue pulled out a semi-automatic pistol and pulled the trigger. Friends: Loetz, left, took to Facebook to thank all her friends. She especially thankful to CJ Abbott, who tried to stop the enraged Shallue when he entered Abbott's home September 4 .

"Liberia's national . existence is 'seriously threatened' by the deadly Ebola virus . that is 'spreading like wild fire and devouring everything in . its path,' the country's national defence minister told the . United Nations Security Council. 'Liberia is facing a serious threat to its national . existence. The deadly Ebola virus has caused a disruption of the . normal functioning of our State,' said Liberian Minister of . National Defense Brownie Samukai. 'It is now spreading like wild fire, devouring everything in . its path. The already weak health infrastructure of the country . has been overwhelmed,' he told the 15-member council, adding . that the initial international response was 'less than robust.' Meanwhile, it's thought that Ebola has now reached Italy, after a Nigerian woman resident there was hospitalised on Tuesday with symptoms consistent with the virus. Health workers load the  body of a woman that they suspect died from the Ebola virus onto a truck in front of a makeshift shop in an area known as Clara Town in Monrovia, Liberia . Liberia is worst hit by West Africa's Ebola epidemic andwill likely see thousands of new cases in coming weeks, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday. Pictured are Liberian health workers on an Ebola burial team collecting the body of a victim of the disease on the outskirts of Monrovia . Warning: Liberia's Minister of National Defense (pictured) said Liberia is facing a 'serious threat to its national existence' because of the Ebola outbreak . The woman, who had recently returned from a visit to Nigeria, has been hospitalised in Ancona and was undergoing tests in a specialist unit to establish whether she has indeed contracted it. Liberia is worst hit by West Africa's Ebola epidemic and . will likely see thousands of new cases in coming weeks, the . World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday. More than 1,000 . people have already died in Liberia. U.N. special envoy to Liberia Karin Landgren told the . council that at least 160 Liberian health care workers had . contracted the disease and half of them had died. She described . the spread of Ebola as 'merciless' and warned that the reported . cases and deaths in Liberia 'understate Ebola's true toll.' 'The speed and scale of the loss of lives, and the economic, . social, political and security reverberations of the crisis are . affecting Liberia profoundly,' she said. 'Liberians are facing . their gravest threat since war.' Two wars between 1989 and 2003 killed about 250,000 people . and led to a complete collapse of Liberia. It was carved up by . warlords who often used child soldiers and fought over control . of diamond and timber concessions.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has recommended a . straightforward extension of three months, instead of one year, . while the international community tackles Ebola. The WHO said on Tuesday that it had recorded 4,293 cases in . five West African countries as of September 6. It said it still did . not have new figures for Liberia. The outbreak began in Guinea . and has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal. An Ebola outbreak said to be unrelated to the one in West . Africa has been reported in Democratic Republic of Congo, where . Ebola was first identified in 1976. Ebola is a haemorrhagic fever spread through body fluids . such as the blood, sweat or vomit of those who are infected with . the disease. Health care workers are among the most vulnerable . to the disease. Liberia's Samukai said nine of Liberia's 15 . counties are affected. 'The pandemic has mushroomed into a health emergency . exceeding the government's response,' he said. 'Liberia lacks . the infrastructure, logistical capacity, professional expertise . and financial resources to effectively address this disease.' The worst epidemic since the disease was discovered has . killed at least 2,296 people. 'It is imperative that we as an international community get . serious about addressing the public health, humanitarian and . security effects of this outbreak,' U.S. Ambassador to the . United Nations, Samantha Power, said after the briefing. 'I don't think anybody can say right now that the . international response to the Ebola outbreak is sufficient,' said Power, who is president of the council for September. 'Every organisation and every single member state in the . international community needs to be looking at how we up our . game.'

"The mother of a terminally ill child who may not live to see another winter transformed her garden into a snowy winter wonderland as a surprise. Melodie Williams, 41, from Rowley Regis near Dudley in the West Midlands, asked local businesses to help with the surprise after deciding she had to make the most of the time she had left with her three-year-old son, Mason. Little Mason, who was born with half a heart and needs a heart and lung transplant, will only be put on the transplant list if his blood pressure goes down - so his mother wanted him to play in snow in case he never got another chance. Terminally-ill Mason Williams, three, gasps in delight as he looks at the winter wonderland in his back garden with his mother, Melodie, 41 . Joy: Mason was born with a heart condition but is not well enough to have the life-saving operation he needs . The mother of five asked people in her area for help to transform her garden and local firms donated trees and lights and organised for 400 litres of snow to be imported to her garden. Mrs Williams said: 'I just had to do something now in case he's not alive next time it snows.' 'If I didn't do it now, and something happens to him, I'd never forgive myself for not making the most of the time we had.' Her youngest son was born with . hypoplastic left heart syndrome, in which the left ventricle is . under-developed at birth.  He also has a rare chromosome disorder which . means he has severe learning difficulties and is unable to speak. Mason has undergone a series of operations at Birmingham Children's Hospital to re-plumb his heart so that one ventricle can do the work of two, but pressure in his lungs means he is unable to undergo the final stages of the life-saving procedure. Mrs Williams said: 'I had a meeting with the cardiologist and he said Mason's blood pressure was too high for him to have an operation to extend his life. Mother of the year: Melodie Williams gives her youngest child a hug in the magical garden she created for him . So happy: Little Mason spent more than an hour playing in the snow in his garden in Rowley Regis near Dudley . 'He said if Mason has the operation now, his heart would not be able to cope with the high pressures of the blood and he would die on the operating table.' She added: 'If his condition does not improve he will not be put on the heart and lung transplant list. 'Right now we're waiting until his pressures go down or the half of his heart that works gives out.' Mrs Williams said: 'I am so grateful to everyone who helped us -  I'm so lucky that I could make this happen for Mason.' She added: 'When he woke up and stepped out of the front door he was so shocked.  He laughed and giggled as he touched the snow, he can't speak but I knew he was loving his treat. 'Watching him was amazing, I will remember it forever.' Firms that helped make Mason's . surprise happen include Hollywood snow company, Snowbusiness, which . imported real snow for Mason to play in, and his local Asda which . donated lights, trees and decorations.","Little Mason Williams, three, was born with hypoplastic left-heart syndrome .

"We're told to eat less if we want to reduce our waistlines. And when it comes to Mars and Snickers treats we’ll be doing just that from now on whether we like it or not… but the manufacturer claims it’s all for our own good. Mars UK is shrinking the size of its two most popular bars again and it says it is doing so to help quell the obesity crisis. However, the move will actually make our purses lighter as the price is staying the same. Shrinking bars: Both Mars and Snickers bars have been reduced in size by more than 10 per cent but the recommended selling price has remained the same . The company said the decision to reduce . Mars from 58g to 51g and Snickers from 58g to 48g is part of a pledge to . cut the calorie count of its products to a maximum of 250. A spokesman . added: ‘To meet our commitment, having taken product reformulation as . far as we can for now without compromising the great taste, we have . reduced the portion size of Mars and Snickers to bring down the . calories.’ Mars will now have 229 calories and Snickers will have 245. In 2008, the company also reduced the bars’ size, from 62.5g to 58g. The chocolate giant committed early in 2012 to cut the calorie content of its single-serve products to a maximum of 250 calories by the end of 2013 as part of its calorie reduction Responsibility Deal pledge. As a result of the size changes, the number of calories in a Mars bar has dropped from 260 to 229 and in a Snickers bar from 280 to 245. Mars said it had little choice but to reduce the size of the products because there was a limit to what could now be achieved through reformulation. In 2010, it cut the saturated fat content of a Mars bar by 15 per cent and removed all transfats. A Mars spokesman told The Grocer: 'As part of our global commitment to promote responsible consumption, and as a signatory of the Responsibility Deal's calorie reduction pledge, we said we would ensure that all our single-serve chocolate products would contain no more than 250 calories per portion. 'To meet our commitment, having taken product reformulation as far as we can for now without compromising the great taste, we have reduced the portion size of Mars and Snickers to bring down the calorie content.' The Grocer magazine says that it is not the first time that Mars has reduced the size of Mars and Snickers. In 2008, it cut the size of both products from 62.5g to 58g while leaving the price the same. Mars has reduced the size of the bars in the wake of big hikes in the cost of chocolate-making over the past decade and cost inflation was particularly severe this year. Mars bars have been reduced from 58g to 51g to ensure they contain less than 250 calories . In analysis for The Grocer in October, commodity pricing specialists Mintec said that cost of producing an average milk chocolate bar had soared by 25 per cent year-on-year, adding 6p to the cost of making a 100g bar of plain milk chocolate. The main culprit for soaring costs was the rocketing price of cocoa butter which has been hit by adverse weather in the Ivory Coast - one of the most important growing countries. In March this year, researchers from consumer watchdog Which? discovered that big name food producers have reduced pack sizes by as much as a quarter without reducing the price. They found that 'underhand' and 'hidden price hikes' were on many items including frozen foods, bags of sweets and crisps and dishwasher tablets. Which? said many everyday products now offer poorer value for money because of the 'hidden price hikes'. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Shrinking products can be an underhand way of raising prices because pack sizes shrink but the prices don't. 'We want simpler pricing so people can easily compare products to see which is the cheapest, and for special offers to be genuine.' When the magazine asked the makers of these products why they had shrunk them, they were generally told that, in the face of rising costs they chose to shrink products rather than increase prices. But a survey of 1,257 Which? members found that well over half - 58 per cent - said they would rather prices rose than packs got smaller. A further 37 per cent would rather the pack shrank, but only if they were told. Earlier this year, former public health minister Anna Soubry described Mars' calorie reduction pledge as ' absolutely brilliant.' She told The Grocer: 'They don't have to do it but are doing it for all the right reasons.'","Chocolate giant Mars has shrunk the size of its bars from 58g to 51g .
Its Snickers bars have also been reduced from 58g to 48g .

"GPs handing out antibiotics to placate demanding patients is leading to a rise in resistant superbugs that could send medicine 'back to the Dark Ages' Family doctors are needlessly doling out antibiotics to ‘placate’ patients, an influential group of MPs warns today. The practice of GPs using the drugs ‘simply to achieve a placebo effect’ is fuelling a growth in antibiotic resistance, according to a report by the Commons Science and Technology Committee. The Mail reported last week how the country’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, said that patients pressing GPs for antibiotics were part of the problem. She also said she will die from a routine infection if she undergoes a hip replacement operation 20 years from now. Another expert said GPs were issuing the drugs to up to 90 per cent of the patients they see with distressing symptoms – whether or not they would be any use. The problem is so serious that David Cameron last week said superbugs’ resistance to antibiotics could send medicine ‘back to the Dark Ages’. Now he is being urged by the committee to back his words with ‘decisive and urgent action’ before it is too late to stem a tide of infections that cannot be treated. The MPs’ report says: ‘For too long, antibiotics have been used as if they were a bottomless pit of cure-all miracle treatments. ‘Antibiotics are ineffective against viruses and other diseases that are not caused by bacteria and the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics has contributed to the acceleration of antibiotic resistance.’ The committee warned in particular of GPs using antibiotics as a placebo to make patients think they are getting effective treatments, even when the drugs have no medical impact. Andrew Miller, chairman of the committee which has completed a seven-month inquiry, said: ‘Antibiotic resistance cannot be entirely prevented, but it is a problem made worse by inappropriate use and poor stewardship of antibiotics in healthcare and farming. About 35¿million prescriptions for antibiotics are are given out a year by GPs in England. The number has risen 30 per cent since 2000 as 5,000 people a year die from resistant bacteria . ‘We heard concerns, for instance, that antibiotics are often prescribed by GPs simply to achieve a placebo effect or placate patients with distressing symptoms. 'In farming, meanwhile, we suspect that antibiotics may be routinely used on healthy animals.’ Dr Michael Moore of the Royal College of General Practitioners told the committee that GPs were issuing antibiotics to up to nine out of ten patients, the report says. Antibiotics, designed to fight bacteria, are routinely given to treat viral infections such as colds and flu. While patients may leave the surgery happy, the prescription will do little to fight their illness. About 35 million prescriptions for antibiotics are dispensed every year by GPs in England. The number has risen 30 per cent since 2000, according to NHS figures. Meanwhile 5,000 people die from antibiotic-resistant infections in England every year. The NHS has brought down rates of two of the most serious superbugs – MRSA and C.difficile – through a huge awareness campaign and improved hygiene in hospitals. But new threats have emerged to replace them, including E.coli, cases of which increased 30 per cent between 2005 and 2009. Increased cleanlines in hospitals has brought rates of MRSA (pictured) and C.difficile infection down but new strains have emerged to replace them, such as E.coli . The committee report says: ‘We found . it difficult to understand how the Government has failed to act . decisively to address the issue of inappropriate prescription of . antibiotics.’ Dame Sally . has asked the Government to put antibiotic resistance on the national . risk register, ranking it alongside a large-scale terrorist attack. She has warned that without action we may return to a ‘19th-century environment’ in which routine operations are potentially deadly. She told the committee: ‘When I need a new hip in 20 years, I will die of a routine infection because we have run out of antibiotics.’ Mr Cameron announced last week that Jim O’Neill, former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, will lead an international group of experts aiming to spur drug development. But Mr Miller said: ‘Publishing strategies and announcing reviews is not the same as dealing with the problem. ‘What we really need from Government right now is decisive and urgent action to prevent antibiotics from being given to people and animals who do not need them.’ The committee says greater public awareness is needed to ease pressure on GPs to dish out the drugs.","MPs warn doctors are handing out too many prescriptions for antibiotics .

"It was the decade that dedicated foodies would rather forget, when the height of sophistication was a prawn cocktail and a Chicken Kiev. But it seems our nostalgia for all things retro has sparked a shopping basket revival for the 70s.

Sales of the £2.99 classic, one of the chef’s ‘all-time favourite things to eat’ after a hard night at his three-star Michelin restaurant according to the marketing blurb, are up by 95 per cent. And even Angel Delight - the packet-mix mousse beloved of children everywhere - has made a comeback.

"Husbands will have to have a difficult conversation with their wives about accessing porn at home, David Cameron said today. The Prime Minister warned that new opt-in filters will mean that couples will have to decide between them if their internet access can be used to view pornography. But he signalled that he thought families with children should opt to block access to adult material. Summit: David Cameron today held talks in Downing Street with members of leading search engines, internet service providers, the National Crime Agency and the NSPCC . Mr Cameron today hosted a summit in Downing Street with search engine giants, internet service providers, charities and the National Crime Agency to tackle the spread of child abuse images online. Internet search results linked to child abuse are to be blocked across the world in a stunning U-turn by Google. The world's biggest media firm has agreed to introduce changes which will prevent depraved images and videos from appearing for more than 100,000 different searches. Intelligence experts at GCHQ have also been drafted in to break the ‘dark web’ which allows paedophiles to share vile images online. By the end of next year the biggest internet providers will require 20 million homes – 95 per cent of all properties with an existing internet connection – to choose whether to switch on a ‘family friendly internet filter’. Filters have already been switched on by the six largest public Wi-Fi providers across Britain and hundreds of thousands of homes have already been opted in. Also attending the summit with David Cameron were Gavin Patterson from BT and Dido Harding from Talk Talk . Michel Van Der Bel, managing director of Microsoft UK, (left) and Google boss Peter Barron were in Downing Street for the summit on internet safety today . Joanna Shields, the UK's Business Ambassador for Digital Industries, joined minister at Number 10 for the talks on web safety . Britain’s spy agencies have been ordered to break up the ‘dark web’ used by paedophiles to share sick child abuse images online. Prime . Minister David Cameron said he wanted GCHQ to do more to find those . trying to ‘hide from justice’ by using encrypted internet networks. It . comes ahead of a Downing Street summit where web firm Google  will . pledge to block internet search results linked to child abuse around the . world. Mr Cameron has made clear that he . wants more to be done to protect internet users from vile images online . while trying to catch those responsible for the abuse. He . has tasked GCHQ intelligence experts to try to track those using secret . links – known as the ‘dark web’ - to share photographs of child abuse. The . National Crime Agency estimates that the number of people in the UK . using encrypted networks has risen by two-thirds and is expected to hit . 20,000-a-day by the end of this year. Some . people could be using them legally, but police and intelligence . agencies believe paedophiles use such networks to distribute child abuse . material. But today Mr Cameron was challenged over how couples will agree over web access, if a husband wants the filters switched off and a wife wants to block pornography. The PM said: ‘Well, they’re going to have to have a discussion, aren’t they? ‘The fact is, I think what ought to happen here and what is going to happen now is when you sign up to an internet service provider, when you take out your broadband account, you are prompted with an online message which is there are these pornography filters that are switched on. ‘If you want to keep them, go ahead, particularly if you’ve got children in the house; if you want to take them off, you have to make an active choice. And I think that’s the right thing to do,’ he told BBC Radio 2. ‘Now, I had around the table with me Virgin Media, TalkTalk, BSkyB and BT, who between them account for almost nine out of ten broadband accounts in the country. ‘So I think this is real progress for people up and down the country, parents like me of three young children, who want to know that there are some limits on what your children can search for on the internet.’ In a major breakthrough, Google has agreed to changes to mark it more difficult to find child abuse images online. The company's chairman Eric Schmidt, writing in today's Daily Mail ahead of a Downing Street summit on internet pornography, says: 'We've listened.' He added: 'We've fine-tuned Google Search to prevent links to child sexual abuse material from appearing in our results.' The restrictions, which have been designed to apply in English-speaking countries, will be expanded to cover the rest of the world and 158 other languages in the next six months. Mr Schmidt also reveals that Google has developed breakthrough technology that will allow illegal videos to be 'tagged' so that all duplicate copies can be removed across the internet.

"Peekaboo: Researchers found that young children believe they are invisible if people can't see their eyes . It's an adorable game parents have played with their young children for generations. But now researchers are looking for a scientific answer to explain why children think they actually disappear when they cover their eyes while playing peekaboo. Researchers led by James Russell at the University of Cambridge have carried out the first study into this bizarre trait with groups of three and four-year-old children. The children's eyes were covered with masks and they were then asked whether they could be seen by the researchers - with most saying no. Many also believed that the researchers could not see adults who were wearing eye masks - leading to the conclusion most young children believe that anyone who covers their eyes is obscured from other people's view. The researchers then attempted to distinguish what exactly creates the feeling of invisibility - whether it was not being able to see at all or just because the other person couldn't see their eyes. The children were given a pair of mirrored goggles so that while they could see through the glasses, no one could see their eyes. Unfortunately, only 7 of the 37 participating children were able to get to grips with the idea that while they could still see, no one could see their eyes. But of those who did understand the concept, six believed they were invisible if the researchers couldn't see their eyes, even if they could still see them. Although when the children were asked to . explain how they were made invisible by simply hiding their eyes, many . knew that their bodies remained visible, suggesting a childhood . distinction between their physical bodies and the 'self' they connect to . their eyes. Hide and seek: The children in the survey also believed that other people become invisible if they cover their eyes even though their bodies are still visible . To test this theory that children believe they can be seen only through their eyes, the researchers looked directly at each of the children while asking them to avert their gaze. They then did the same process in reverse, with the children looking at the researchers while they diverted their eyes. In each instance, the majority of children felt they were not being seen so long as their eyes didn't meet the other person's, giving some support to the ideology of eyes being the the window to the soul.","University of Cambridge researchers found that children believe they become invisible if other people can't see their eyes .

"Unusual: The jet-black variety is said to be healthier than its red cousin as it has more anti-oxidants . We're already growing purple carrots, yellow courgettes and white asparagus. But black tomatoes are the must-have crop for greenhouses this season, growers say. Not only will the dark toms turn heads at the allotment society, they are also healthier than normal red varieties, according to plant scientists. The new tomato starts out as a normal green fruit, but ripens to a jet-black colour. On sale for the first time this year, the new ‘Indigo Rose’ was cultivated by breeding red and purple tomato plants, and is being heralded as a new superfood. Scientists in America bred purple tomatoes contained anthocyanin, an antioxidant said to help fight diabetes and obesity, with normal red varieties. Devon-based Sutton Seeds have secured the rights to start selling the new plants in the UK for the first time this spring. Alfie Jackson, assistant product manager at Suttons Seeds of Paignton, Devon, said: ‘They are not as sweet as normal tomatoes and have a more savoury flavour, and are nice roasted or eaten in salads. ‘There are some dark coloured tomatoes but Indigo Rose is the only real black tomato and is the darkest that has ever been bred. ‘It was bred by Professor Jim Myers at the University of Oregon in the US and came about after a graduate student was interested in looking at health benefits in tomatoes. ‘They found some tomatoes with purple pigmentation and tests revealed that anthocyanins were providing the colour, the same as blueberries. ‘They crossed the purple tomatoes with some wild tomatoes and eventually came up with a black strain. This is the first time they have been available to buy in the UK. American nutritionists advise people eat the less sweet version to fight obesity and help diabetes . ‘During the growth process it starts out green like all tomatoes and when the sun hits the fruit it turns black rather than red.’ Demand for vegetable seeds and plants have soared in the last fortnight, as gardens come to life following a miserable winter. Gardeners are opting in increasing numbers for rare crops such as okra, purple carrots and specialist vegetables used in stir fries such as Pak Choi, oriental mustard and red hot chillies, which fetch high prices in the supermarkets. Homebase buyer Orla Forde said 26 per cent of all homeowners in the UK now possess a vegetable plot. ‘An entire generation is rediscovering the delicate flavours of vegetables cooked straight from the garden,’ she said. ‘Increasing food prices are driving households to become more self-sufficient.’","Dark tomatoes 'healthier' than red variety, according to plant scientists .

"Staggering demand for computer tablets has seen British shoppers buy one every second as the rush for Christmas gifts goes into overdrive. Some shops are reporting sales of tablets like the iPad and Google Nexus 7 are up by 1,000 per cent from last year, leading retailers to brand 2012 the 'tablet Christmas'. The frenzy began last week on Cyber Monday when a tablet was sold every second, and it is forecasted demand will continue to be high during the countdown to Christmas. Apple will be hoping to come on top of the sales charts again with its iPad Mini . But the California giant faces a battle with rival Google, which launched its Nexus 7 earlier this year . A spokesman for Dixons, which runs Curry's and PC World, told The Observer: 'We are still looking to sell a tablet every two seconds between now and Christmas. 'iPads were big last year, but the new devices that have come out this year have really opened up the market to a much wider audience.' Top-of-the-range tablets are this year being sold between £159-£529, and retailers say a greater choice of products is fueling the sales rush. Apple is not is as dominant this year as rivals have come out in force to rival its flagship iPad. The Kindle Fire HD, Google Nexus 7, and the Nook HD are proving popular, although retailers say it is too early to say which brand will top the sales chart. The Kindle Fire HD tablet is also proving popular with shoppers in the countdown to Christmas . Sales of the Nook HD have contributed to British shoppers buying a new computer tablet once every second . Other firms reported bumper sales. John Lewis saw a 250 per cent year-on-year rise, and said it expects a further boost in the next fortnight. Argos said it hopes to sell a million tablets by the end of the year. 'We definitely believe this will be a tablet Christmas,' Argos technology trading manager Simon Barry told the paper. 'We are seeing more and more people wanting ""my"" tablet, rather than ""our"" tablet - with multiple devices going into homes.' He added tablets aimed at children were expected to be popular, including the Nabi, which, according to maker Fuhu, is the 'world's first and most powerful tablet made just for kids'. It lauched in Britain in October, costing £149.99, rivaling the Innotab 2, which is priced at £84.99 and aimed at four-to-nine-year-olds. Cheaper tablets for adults like the basic CnM Touchpad, priced at £100, are also expected to sell well.","Retailers brand 2012 the 'tablet Christmas'

"Criticism: NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson has said that hospitals are 'very bad places' for elderly people . Hospitals are ‘very bad places’ for elderly people, according to the head of the NHS. Sir David Nicholson said they were not the right place to care for ‘old, frail people’, and called for community care to be expanded to accommodate the growing elderly population. He compared modern treatment of the elderly to the ‘national scandals’ of the Sixties and Seventies caused by treating mental health patients in large asylums. ‘If you think about the average general hospital now, something like 40 per cent of the patients will have some form of dementia,’ Sir David told The Independent. ‘They [hospitals] are very bad places for old, frail people. We need to find alternatives.’ He added: ‘The nature of our patients is changing – and changing rapidly. You are getting a larger and larger group of frail, elderly patients who are confused.’ Sir David, who is currently the NHS’s chief executive, was speaking for the first time since his appointment as head of the Health Service’s Commissioning Board. The new body will take over responsibility for all NHS services in England from the Department of Health in April. His warning comes after a series of scandals involving substandard care of the elderly, including at Stafford Hospital, where up to 1,200 patients may have died unnecessarily. He said: ‘I would compare it with where we got to with the big asylums. If you remember what happened in the 1960s and 1970s, there was a whole series of national scandals about care of mentally ill patients. ‘The response was not just to say that the nurses who looked after these patients needed to be more caring, but actually there was something about the way we treated these patients and the model of care that needed to change.’ Sir David’s plans to revolutionise elderly care, particularly for dementia patients, include treating common conditions locally and using funds to keep patients out of hospital. Creating community-based treatment centres, managing long-term conditions and preventing falls would be key to future care of the elderly, he said. Such expansion of community services could lead to hospital closures, with services concentrated in larger, specialist centres. In December, Prince Charles spoke about the ‘crisis in caring’ in Britain, warning that modern medicine and technology were putting the ‘human touch’ at risk. He said he was ‘sure that there is much more that can be done to foster and enhance those age-old qualities of human kindness and compassion’. Weeks earlier, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had said there was a ‘kind of normalisation of cruelty’ in the worst hospitals. Sir David – who will be in charge of an annual budget of £93billion, but seek more than £20billion of savings – said the Commissioning Board would not be afraid to challenge ministers over financing. 'Very bad places': Sir David Nicholson said that hospitals are not the right place to care for 'old, frail people' and called community care to be expanded to cope with a growing elderly population (file picture) He said it would also tell the public how much money the NHS needs to achieve goals such as keeping waiting lists down and improving life expectancy. ‘We will be saying, “If that’s the amount of money which is available, these are the sorts of things we will be able to deliver and these are the sorts of things that we can’t”,’ he said. ‘That’s a big change. We will be saying, “If you do this, this is what we think the implications will be”.’","Sir David Nicholson has called for community care to be expanded .

"Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been left red-faced after a video shot by a celebrity home designer depicting his modest lifestyle was revealed to be recorded in his servants' quarters. The 15-minute film by Moshik Galamin showed Mr Netanyahu's wife Sara guiding the viewer around the couple's home, where run down parts of the property such as creaking doors and frayed carpets, are detailed. But it has now emerged Galamin was not granted access to the couple's upstairs living quarters, and Israel's Channel 10 TV claimed the kitchen in question was not even the one the Netanyahus use, but rather a secondary administrative kitchen. Netanyahu's wife Sara bemoans the state of their kitchen in a home remodelling show. However, it has emerged the kitchen is used by administrative staff, not the the Netanyahus themselves . Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu (pictured) has become embroiled in an expenses controversy after an official watchdog criticised his spending of taxpayers' money on food, furniture and gardening . The embarrassing video forms just one of a series of damaging developments in Netanyahu's expenses controversy after an official watchdog criticised his spending of taxpayers' money. In the clip, Sara Netanyahu unveils to interior designer Galamin a simple home with creaking doors and windows, frayed carpets, dusty lamps, cracked light fixtures and paint peeling off neglected walls. She bemoans how they didn't have the budget to fix upholstery before the 2013 visit of President Barack Obama and says he was forced to sit on a coffee-stained couch. 'I don't notice the details because I don't dare think about it,' she says as she points to mildew in a courtyard. 'When you walk out, make sure the door handle doesn't break off,' she said with a giggle as he parted. Galamin, who hosts a popular home remodeling TV show, said he funded the shoot - which opposition lawmakers say violated Israeli campaign finance laws. A former chief of the Shin Bet security service called the film a 'severe security breach' and said terrorist groups would have been willing to pay a hefty sum to acquire such an inside look at the prime minister's home. Netanyahu's office had no immediate comment on the TV report. Sara Netanyahu - a former member of the couple's housekeeping staff has filed a lawsuit claiming he was mistreated and verbally abused by her . The video, perhaps ironically, is set to catchy background music that includes the theme song from the Netflix series 'House of Cards' and Justin Timberlake's hit 'Cry Me a River.' 'It was like a horrific traffic accident-something that you can't bear to watch but at the same time you can't tear your eyes away,' wrote Sima Kadmon, a frequent critic of the Netanyahus, sarcastically adding outrage over 'the shameful quality of life the royal family has been forced to live in during its years in power.' Netanyahu's rivals pounced on the material. The centrist Yesh Atid party, which has made corruption a centerpiece of its campaign, said the report and video reflected how disconnected Netanyahu was from real problems of average Israelis, who just three years ago took to the streets en masse to protest the country's high cost of living. 'What matters are the citizens, not the carpets,' it said. Meanwhile, the government's state comptroller has found 'excessive' amounts of public funds have been spent by Mr Netanyahu and his wife Sara, on food, furniture and gardening at their state residence and private home. In a report by the official watchdog, it was claimed cleaning expenses in the home on the coastal city of Caesarea averaged more than £1,370 a month in taxpayer's money even though the couple only spent the occasional weekend there. It was also said they pocketed proceeds from recycling bottles that had been purchased for entertaining official guests. It said the bottle returns, and purchases of garden furniture for their private home, may have violated the law. The watchdog's findings have ramped up tensions between the premier and his opponents in the run -up to elections on March 17 which have focused on the economic woes of middle and lower-class voters. Mr Netanyahu promised to follow the recommendations to curb spending but he also criticised the 'ongoing media campaign' surrounding the report, which he said was aimed at toppling him. Netanyahu's opponents have tried to portray him as enjoying a lavish lifestyle and being out of touch with the struggles of average Israelis. Netanyahu's allies angrily dismissed the allegations as part of a campaign to deflect attention from important national security issues. Mr Netanyahu and his wife are no strangers to such scrutiny. The prime minister has long been saddled with an image as a cigar-smoking, cognac-drinking socialite, while his wife has come under fire for her own expensive tastes and alleged abusive behavior toward staff. The Netanyahus accuse the Israeli media of a longstanding witch hunt against them. In a statement, Netanyahu said he respected the findings of the comptroller and pledged to implement recommendations to curb wasteful spending. Two days before the state comptroller released its report, Netanyahu posted a 15-minute video on Facebook that appeared aimed at countering his hedonistic image ahead of March 17 elections . At the same time he lashed out at the 'ongoing media campaign' that he said is aimed at toppling him. 'There is absolutely no indication of any assault on the public's integrity and certainly no indication of any criminal transgressions,' he said. A former member of their housekeeping staff has filed a lawsuit claiming he was mistreated and verbally abused by Sara Netanyahu. In one instance, Meni Naftali alleged she called him at 3am to complain that he had bought milk in a plastic storage bag instead of a carton. In another, he claimed that she chastised him because some flowers in a vase were a day old. Netanyahu said expenses have dropped significantly in the two years since the departure of Naftali, a man he described as 'an embittered former public employee.' Over the years, reports have been released about the high cost of the Netanyahus' catering, housekeeping, furniture, clothing and makeup. In one case, the premier was chided for spending $127,000 in public funds for a special sleeping cabin on a flight to London. Even their costly purchases of scented candles and pistachio-flavored ice cream have been derided. Two days before the state comptroller released its report, Netanyahu posted a 15-minute video on Facebook that appeared aimed at countering the hedonistic image ahead of March 17 elections that have focused on the economic woes of middle and lower-class voters.","Benjamin Netanyahu has become embroiled in an expenses controversy .

The digital media company came 'very close' to a deal with Time Warner to sell a 45 percent stake in the company according to Buzzfeed. The deal would have included Time Warner bundling the HLN network into another Vice-directed endeavor and injecting it with cash. After the deal fell through, Vice sold off about 10 percent of its estimated value to A&E, reports the New York Times. Layoffs: In addition to her own program, Velez-Mitchell had filled in for other Headline News anchors like Nancy Grace .

"Barack Obama is facing poll numbers that are now in the same territory as President George W. Bush's following Hurricane Katrina. The Quinnipiac University Polling Institute released numbers on Tuesday showing that just 38 per cent of registered voters approve of the job Obama is doing as president, with a whopping 56 per cent saying they disapprove. The president has lost his landslide electoral edge among young voters, too, with a negative 41–49 per cent rating among 18- to 29-year-old voters. His once formidable support among Hispanics has also evaporated: They now support him by an historically small 50–43 per cent margin. Worse for Obama's fast-approaching legacy-building years, the public believes he is not 'honest and . trustworthy,' by a 52–44 per cent score. A smaller majority, 51 per cent, said he lacks 'strong leadership qualities.' Respondents said by a 41–38 per cent gap that they would vote for a Republican over a Democrat for the U.S. House of Representatives, the first time this year Democrats have had a winning posture in the Quinnipiac poll. Friendlier shores: Barack Obama got a rousing ovation from a crowd attending the official memorial service for late South African president Nelson Mandela on Tuesday, a change of pace from Americans who are losing faith in his policies . Majority Leader? Mitch McConnell, the leader of the U.S. Senate's GOP minority, would run Congress' upper chamber in 2015 if the public's feelings about who should run the Capitol hold up . And 47 per cent of voters said they would like to see Republicans gain control of both houses of Congress. The GOP can achieve that outcome if it holds the House and picks up seven Senate seats in November 2014. Fully half of independent voters – those aligned with neither the Democratic nor the Republican party – said they would back a Congress completely under Republican control. 'President Obama could be pretty lonely during his last two years in office if voters decide they want Republican majorities in the House and Senate,' said Quinnipiac University Polling Institute assistant director Tim Malloy. But Congress hasn't had an easy ride either: 74 per cent of voters disapprove of the way Congressional Republicans are doing their jobs. A smaller 67 per cent group says Democrats in Congress are also falling shirt of the mark. Exhibit A: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is presiding over a health insurance overhaul that has drawn catcalls and sighs from the public as its website flails and its sticker shocks hit home . Pollsters interviewed nearly 2,700 voters between Dec. 3 and Dec. 9, asking their opinions after a spate of positive news hit TV broadcasts and Internet news portals about jobs and the economy. The results suggest the staying power of Obama's unpopular health insurance overhaul and his administration's controversial nuclear deal with Iran. Even Democrats are beginning to doubt the president who famously promised hope and change: 18 per cent of them now say they're no fans of Obama's work in the Oval Office. Malloy called the news 'a rousing chorus of Bah! Humbug! for President Barack Obama as American voters head into the holidays with little charitable to say.' That includes his handling of specific issues. While Obama enjoys a 50–41 per cent positive rating for his handling of terrorism, that's the only issue Quinnipiac polled where he comes out on top. He's under water on the economy, 37–59 per cent, 34–62 percent on health care and 42–49 per cent on foreign policy. Iran, too, is making Americans uncomfortable. Just 40 per cent of registered voters say they approve of the White House's approach to the Islamic republic, whose expanding nuclear program is the subject of a deal brokered in November by the U.S. and five other nations. A larger 48 per cent group disapprove. Americans are less disapproving of the agreement itself, by a 44–46 margin, and a 45–37 plurality say it will make America 'less safe.' Making nice with the mullahs? Secretary of State John Kerry got a grilling in a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Tuesday, defending the Obama administration's decision to pursue a nuclear pact with Iran . The only good news for the White House is that Americans support Obama's pitch to raise the minimum wage nation-wide. Fully 69 per cent support hiking it by at least some amount, with 27 per cent opposed.  But the pollsters offered their interviewees three separate choices of how much to raise the minimum wage, compared with only one option to leave it alone. GOP lawmakers cite economic studies that show minimum wage hikes have corresponded with job losses, particularly among low-skilled and minority workers, as companies let people go in order to comply with wage hikes without spending more money on human resources.","Obama's support among young voters has disappeared, with 49 per cent now saying they disapprove of his job performance .

"It may not come as a surprise that people in Somalia eat less than Europeans and Americans. But an infographic detailing the precise qualities of meals consumed by citizens of different countries provides some serious food for thought. The interactive pie chart shows  that Germans drink the most alcohol, while Americans consume the most sugary and fatty food and Indians are most likely to be vegetarian. Scroll down for interactive module . Food for thought: The infographic details the precise qualities of food consumed by people in different countries, and what they choose to eat. This pie chart shows what the average person eats - irrelevant of which country they live in . It was created by data experts at National Geographic, as part of its Future of Food series, using data from FAOSTAT. The interactive chart reveals how diets vary around the world and how they have evolved over the last 50 years, as well as showing quantities of food consumed per person in each place, in calories and grams. It also details the proportion of food items such as meat and grains in each overall diet, including produce, which means starchy roots, vegetables and fruit and ‘other’ food, which includes alcohol. In terms of which country eats the most calories per day, the US comes out top in the nations documented in the graph. Famine and feast: Americans eat the most calories daily (left) from the nations documented in the graph, at 3,61 daily calories, while Somalis consume the least - eating just 1,695 calories a day. Milk products make up more than half of their food intake . Greedy: Britons  over-eat, according to the chart, consuming an average of 3,413 calories, which is  more than the recommended calorie intake for a man - of 2,500 calories. This figure is fuelling fears that an obesity epidemic will negatively impact the NHS . The average American eats 3,641 calories per day, which is significantly higher than the 2,500 calories that are recommended for the average healthy man to maintain his weight. People in the US consume more than two-and-a-half as many grams of vegetable oil per day than they did 50 years ago - accounting for more than half of the 26 per cent increase in calorie consumption. This is because the US is the world's top oilseed producer. They also eat a diet rich in sugar and fats. In contrast, Somalis eat just 1,695 calories per day – the lowest calorific consumption of any other population. Milk products make up more than half of their daily food intake. Britons also over-eat, according to the chart, consuming an average of 3,413 calories, fuelling fears that an obesity epidemic will trigger a crisis within NHS. Hungry for more: The average person consumes 130 grams of sugar and fat a day, making up 20 per cent of their daily food intake, based on 2011 figures. This percentage has risen by four per cent over 50 years. A stock image of a lollipop is pictured . Sweet tooth: The US is the top consumer of sugar and fats, according to the infographic pictured left, and the average American’s diet is composed of 37 per cent of these ingredients, which are known to be bad for humans. In contrast, Vietnam and North Korea eat the least amount of sugars and fats, comprising just 10 per cent of their daily diet (right) The US is also top consumer of sugar and fats, according to the infographic, making up almost 40 per cent of the average American's diet. Sugar and sweeteners account for 16 per cent of their diet, while oils make up 19 per cent and oil and sugar crops two per cent. Their consumption has grown by eight per cent over 50 years and in 1961, arguably accounting for the rise in obesity in the nation. The average Briton’s diet is made up of 25 per cent of these ingredients – five per cent higher than the global average. In contrast, Vietnam and North Korea eat the least amount of sugars and fats, comprising just 10 per cent of their daily diet. North Koreans eat the most grain-heavy diet, comprising rice, wheat and other cereals, while Spanish people consume the least at 21 per cent. Food on the grain: North Koreans eat the most grain-heavy diet at 63 per cent of their total food intake, (pictured left) comprising rice, wheat and other cereals, while Spanish people consume the least at 21 per cent (right) Half a century ago, almost three quarters of North Korea’s calorific consumption was made up of grains. While this has dropped slightly to 63 per cent, the secretive country is still the world’s highest in terms of grain consumption as a proportion of the natural diet, with rice being the most important grain eaten. South Koreans' diets have diversified and become richer since the 1960s but North Koreans have seen little progress in making their diets more interesting and nutritious. Spain's Mediterranean-inspired diet consists of more grams of produce, milk and meat than it does grains. People have the lowest percentage of cereals in their diet shown in the selection of pie charts, at 21 per cent. This compares with the global average of 45 per cent.

Big drinkers: According to the chart, Germans are the heaviest drinkers (Oktoberfest is pictured) but Britons aren't far behind. Britons are the second keenest drinkers – tied with people living in Japan, Spain and Russia - with alcohol accounting for five per cent of food . Booze cruise: Germans are the biggest drinkers with alcohol making up 7 per cent of the daily diet (pictured left), according to the graph, while people living in many countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia consume no alcohol at all (right) Moving on to drink, Germans are the biggest boozers, with alcohol making up seven per cent of the daily diet, according to the graph. In contrast, the average person living in Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Somalia consume absolutely no alcohol, because of the large Muslim populations. Britons are the second heaviest drinkers – tied with people living in Japan, Spain and Russia - with alcohol accounting for five per cent of the daily diet. The chart also shows that Indians eat the least meat, with just one per cent of the daily diet made up of meat. India's primarily vegetarian diet has changed very little, considering the country's population has more than doubled in the last 50 years. Alongside the growth of the country's economy, the consumption of dairy, eggs and produce has increased more than two-fold. However, people living in Hong Kong east the most, at 29 per cent. Hong Kong's diet has changed dramatically over the past half century, with the average person eating more grams of meat per day than any other food group.

"Nancy Snyderman's actions caused a local maid to get fired due to Ebola fears in the town . NBC chief medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman caused a local maid to be fired when she violated a voluntary Ebola quarantine agreement. The maid, known only as Vilma, was turned away by two of her employers after Dr Snyderman visited her favorite New Jersey soup restaurant last week. Vilma's brother is the chef at The Peasant Grill, near Princeton, and people in the town were concerned that the woman could have been exposed to the deadly virus. They panicked because  one of the members of the quarantined NBC crew went into the restaurant and they feared the chef may have then exposed his sister to the disease, TMZ reported. Two homeowners who had been using Vilma for years told her she could not work with them until further notice. Dr Syderman, 62, was one of seven people ordered to cut off all human contact for 21 days after the station's cameraman Ashoka Mukpo tested positive for Ebola while working in Liberia. But witnesses said that the physician and broadcaster wore sunglasses with her hair in a ponytail as she pulled up in her Mercedes outside the soup restaurant. Shortly after the alleged trip to the dining spot, the New Jersey Department of Health forced Dr Snyderman and her crew into mandatory quarantine. Local health officials say they investigated and there is no risk that anyone who was in the restaurant could have contracted Ebola during the incident. However, it seems that not everyone believes this. According to the National Review Online, neighbors say that the previously well-reviewed Peasant Grill restaurant now appears to be quite empty. Scroll down for video . The maid's brother was a chef at The Peasant Grill restaurant - where Dr Snyderman visited last week in breach of her Voluntary Ebola quarantine agreement . It has also suffered a few questionable reviews. 'Please understand that people who have recently returned from Africa and were quarantined for Ebola, broke thier [sic] quarantine order and went to this establishment to pick up food,' one person wrote on Google Reviews. 'This is very serious, there is no hard facts about how Ebola is transmitted, it is such a serious, virulent virus. Be careful, don't go to this restaurant anytime soon. They should, out of an abundance of caution, close thier [sic] doors for a reasonable period of time and sue Dr Nancy Snyderman.' But at Yelp Reviews, users are still rating the restaurant five stars - even if they are making a bit of a joke about it. Neighbors say that the previously well-reviewed Peasant Grill restaurant  has appeared quite empty . Dr Snyderman has not accepted personal responsibility for the violation, but shifted the blame onto her team . 'I know everyone is raving about their ebolas of soup – and I love them as much as the next guy, but not sure if I would die for them,' one person wrote. Dr Snyderman has not yet accepted personal responsibility for the violation, instead shifting the blame onto  the whole team. In an apologetic statement read out on NBC on Monday, she said: 'While under voluntary quarantine guidelines, which called for our team to avoid public contact for 21 days, members of our group violated those guidelines and understand that our quarantine is now mandatory until 21 days have passed. 'We remain healthy and our temperatures are normal. 'As a health professional I know that we have no symptoms and pose no risk to the public, but I am deeply sorry for the concerns this episode caused.' Nancy Snyderman, pictured while covering the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, was one of seven people ordered to cut off all human contact for 21 days  as doctors treat the station's cameraman Ashoka Mukpo for the virus . The group was reporting on the Ebola outbreak for NBC News in Liberia when Mukpo, their freelance cameraman, was diagnosed with the virus just a day after he was hired to work for the team. Mukpo's family said last week that he believed he had contracted Ebola when he was washing down a vehicle that had transported bodies that perished from the disease. Ebola is transmitted through contact with blood and body fluids. The cameraman was infected in West Africa but is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha after being flown in on a specially-altered flight with an isolation chamber. The 33-year-old has received an experimental drug called brincidofovir, or CMX001, and a blood transfusion from Dr Kent Brantly, who beat Ebola. An NBC spokesman said on Monday that the network could not comment on any individual case, but noted that the team was deemed to be low-risk upon its return from Liberia. Ashoka Mukpo was infected in West Africa a day into working for NBC but is being treated in Nebraska . He added that they had agreed to follow the guidelines set by local health authorities which included the 21-day isolation period. He said: 'We fully support those guidelines and continue to expect that they be followed. 'Our team are all well with normal temperatures, which they check multiple times a day, and they are also in daily contact with local health officials.' Meanwhile, in a phone interview with the Today show last week, Dr Snyderman said all the gear she and her crew used was being disinfected because they all shared work space and vehicles. She also said that she believed she and her team were at a low risk because they have been 'hyper-vigilant'. Nurses Amber Jay Vinson, left, and Nina Pham, right, are both being treated for the deadly virus after becoming infected while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan, who died from the disease . Hospitals across the U.S. remain on high alert over the outbreak of Ebola. Yesterday a second healthcare worker in Texas was diagnosed with Ebola after treating U.S. 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan. Nurse Amber Jay Vinson, 29, originally from Akron, Ohio, is 'ill but clinically stable' after reporting a fever at Texas Presbyterian in Dallas. Another nurse, Nina Pham, 26, was also being treated for Ebola after becoming infected with the disease while caring for Mr Duncan at Texas  Presbyterian. Miss Pham, a Texas Christian University nursing school graduate, is in isolation at the same hospital. Her condition improved after receiving a blood transfusion from Ebola-survivor Dr Kent Brantly.","Maid Vilma's brother is chef at NJ restaurant visited by Nancy Snyderman .

"High Street fashion chain Zara is under investigation over the use of sweatshops and child labour, it was revealed last night. ‘Degrading’ factory conditions in Argentina were reportedly used to produce clothes for the store that boasts the Duchess of Cambridge and Samantha Cameron among its fans. Mostly Bolivian labourers, including children, were made to work up to 16-hour days without breaks and were prevented from leaving the factories without permission, according to investigators. Scrutiny: High-street fashion store Zara is under investigation over the use of slave labour at factories in Argentina, it was reported today . Authorities moved in on the sweatshops . on the outskirts of Buenos Aires after a tip-off from a workers’ rights . charity. Gustavo Vera, a spokesman for the charity La Alameda, said . people were made to start at 7am and work without a break until as late . as 11pm, from Monday to Saturday. He said: ‘Their workplaces were also . their homes, families were forced to share cramped quarters in a mess of . sewing machines, needles, threads and children. The places were dark . without proper lighting to sew and no ventilation.’ Royal seal of approval: Zara is a favourite with the Middleton sisters- both were seen wearing the brand the morning after the royal wedding in April 2011 with Kate wearing a Zara dress and Pippa wearing a Zara blazer . Fan: Samantha Cameron wearing trousers and grey top from Zara which has been accused of using slave labour at factories in Argentina . Zara has seen profits soar over the . past three years – no doubt aided by the ‘Kate effect’ as the Duchess is . regularly spotted wearing their garments. Her sister Pippa is also a . fan as are Mary Berry, Tess Daley and Mrs Cameron. The Spanish-owned . retailer has 1,540 stores worldwide including 64 in the UK. The publicity-shy founder and . majority-owner of Inditex, the company that owns Zara, is 77-year-old . Amancio Ortega. He is the world’s third richest man with a fortune of . £38billion, according to Forbes. Among the items being sewn at one . clandestine workshop in Buenos Aires, according to the Argentinian . authorities, were pieces from the Zara Man fashion line, which are sold . in British stores. Juan Gomez Centurion, head of . Argentina’s Government Control Agency which raided three factories . producing Zara clothes last week, said: ‘We found men and children who . lived in the place where they worked. They were not registered and they . were living in terrible conditions. Founder: Inditex which owns Zara is a family business founded in 1975 by Amancio Ortega . They had no official documents and . were held against their will, they were not allowed to leave their . workplaces without permission.’ This is the second time Zara has been accused of involvement in slave and child labour in South America. In 2011 a group of workers – 14 . Bolivians and one Peruvian – were rescued from an unlicensed factory in . Sao Paulo, Brazil, where clothes carrying the Zara label were being . produced. The immigrant workers, one of whom was . reported to be just 14, were living in dangerous and unhygienic . conditions, forced to work 12-hour shifts for between £95 and £176 a . month. The company was later forced to . apologise in front of state deputies at Sao Paulo’s Human Rights . Commission, and paid fines totalling more than £350,000 as well as . compensation to  the workers. Zara said yesterday they were . ‘surprised’ by the revelations and claimed they had not been officially . notified by the Argentinian authorities. A spokesman said: ‘From the limited . information we have, which are the addresses of the workshops, they have . no relationship with our suppliers and manufacturers in the country.’ He added that Zara has 60 Argentine . manufacturers and in the last two  years conducted 300 audits of . suppliers and factories, but would co-operate with any investigation.","Immigrant workers discovered producing clothes in 'degrading' conditions .

"The fiancée of Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber has admitted that she previously bought Washington farmland that was intended to be used to illegally grow marijuana. Cylvia Hayes, 46, bought the $245,000 property at Colville Indian Reservation, Okanogan with her then-boyfriend just months after she was paid $5,000 to marry another man, an immigrant from Ethiopia. The pot farm revelation, which was reported by The Oregonian on Monday, comes just days after Hayes admitted to the sham marriage and Kitzhaber, 67, revealed he had known nothing of it. On Monday, retired real estate broker Patrick Siemion told the newspaper that Hayes and her then-boyfriend had bought the remote 60-acre lot in November 1997 with a $16,000 down payment. Revelations: Cylvia Hayes wipes away a tear at a press conference last week as she admitted she had married an immigrant so he could stay in the U.S. She has now admitted to buying a farm to grow pot in the 90s . Hayes responded with a comment, saying: 'The property in Okanogan was intended to be the site of a marijuana grow operation that never materialized. I was never financially involved with it. I did not pay any part of the down payment or mortgage payments.' But Siemon told the Oregonian that, after the property went into foreclosure, he found marijuana trimmings, fertilizer and used irrigation tubing, which he believes showed signs pot had been grown. While he never saw any marijuana growing at the farm, he said that it was clear that the couple had bought the land for its remoteness. Siemion said he remembered Hayes because the pretty woman struck him as the sort of person he had never pictured living in a remote cabin. He also recalled that she took charge of the meetings. 'He was not the leader,' Siemion said of the man. 'The leader was her. She did all the talking, all the negotiating. I remember her saying, ""Oh this is just the perfect place, we're so happy to have it"".' In her statement, Hayes said that she had been in a troubled relationship at the time. 'I am not proud of that brief period of time,' she said. 'I was involved in an abusive relationship with a dangerous man.' Together: Hayes, 46, is engaged to Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber, 67, pictured right, whom she met in 2002 . Shock: Kitzhaber, pictured on Friday, only learned about the sham marriage last week, he said . KOIN reported that her ex-boyfriend, whose name has not been released, has a history of domestic violence convictions. Siemion said they paid rent for a few months. Hayes wrote in her statement that she began to make plans to leave in the spring of 1998. By July, she had moved to Oregon. She added that she hadn't used money she received from her marriage to an Ethiopian immigrant to buy the farm. Instead, that money was used to buy a lap top and pay school expenses, she said. Last week, Hayes admitted that she was paid around $5,000 for the 1997 marriage to Ethiopian immigrant Abraham Abraham. The couple filed for divorce in 2001. On Monday, she faced yet more scrutiny as her fiancee asked a state ethics commission to review her consulting business and how it might affect her role as first lady. Hayes tripled her 2012-2013 income to at least $85,000 via consulting contracts with organizations seeking to influence state policy, the Willamette Week newspaper reported last week. It added that state-paid staff had given administrative support to Hayes' business. Hayes is not a state employee and does not collect a state paycheck. But bowing to political pressure, Kitzhaber's general counsel, Liani Reeves, asked the Government Ethics Commission to rule on whether Hayes is a public official and thus subject to state ethics statutes. Last week, she said at the time of the sham marriage she had been 'associating with the wrong people and struggling to put herself through college and regrets her actions'. Remote: Hayes and a former boyfriend bought remote land in the Colville Reservation, seen above, in 1997 and she has admitted that they intended to grow pot there - but their plan never materialized . Regrets: Hayes, pictured last week, said she was in an abusive relationship at the time she bought the farm . Hayes, 47, also admitted she did never told the governor about the marriage. The marriage, her third, was uncovered when the Willamette Week newspaper began asking questions. She had previously claimed to have only been married twice. Governor Kitzhaber met Hayes in 2002 and the two became engaged earlier this year. On Friday, he said he was hurt when he learned about the fraudulent marriage. 'I learned this three days ago,' Kitzhaber said at the City Club of Portland. 'I was obviously very taken aback by it and hurt. I have some processing to do on that.'","Cylvia Hayes, 46, who became engaged to Governor John Kitzhaber, 67, earlier this year, has admitted to buying the $245,000 property in 1997 .

"Britain has wasted £250,000 of its aid budget trying to bring green electricity to a community of 55 people in the South Pacific.

A report from the Department for International Development (DfID) admitted officials had failed to ‘rigorously manage’ the Pitcairn Islands’ eco project. Wasted energy: Britain has wasted £250,000 of its aid budget trying to bring green electricity the Pitcairn islands . Population: There are only around 55 people on the islands, making the original scheme cost the equivalent of £31,000 per head . By the time the scheme was abandoned it had slipped three years behind schedule and doubled in initial costs. The UK first took responsibility for the remote volcanic islands after they were inhabited by mutinous sailors from the crew of the Bounty in 1789. Led by Fletcher Christian, they settled there to escape the hangman’s noose after staging a rebellion against Captain William Bligh. All of the rocky outcrop’s inhabitants can trace their roots back to members of the crew of the Bounty. Two years ago the Mail revealed that the . overseas territory received £2.4million a year from British taxpayers – . more than £43,000 per person every year. Mutiny: English sailor Fletcher Christian led the mutiny against Captain William Bligh on HMS Bounty in 1789 . Now, documents reveal £250,000 of the UK’s aid budget has been wasted trying to bring wind power to the descendants of the ship’s mutinous crew. During the fiasco the UK taxpayer ended up having to foot the bill for chartering a ship to take equipment to the islands. But the charter had to be cancelled because the shipment was not ready to transport. Eventually officials from DfID decided to abandon the scheme. Experts are now trying to convince them that a solar-powered generator would be a better option. Critics have questioned why the islands need such an expensive green electricity system in the first place. There are only around 55 people living there – so the original scheme cost the equivalent of £31,000 per head. Now, if DfID gives the green light to the new solar-powered generator, the total cost of the island’s electricity supply will be even higher than the estimated bill for the original project. Aid bosses say the Government has a duty to spend cash on the island, as it is still a British Overseas Territory. Overseas Territories take priority from the aid budget under laws set down in the UN Charter. But the Government has been roundly criticised for ring-fencing the UK’s aid spending in a time of austerity. Foreign aid is one of the few departments not to have faced a cut in funding. A report into the defunct scheme explains: ‘The contractors engaged in 2007 completed the first stages of the project. ‘However, due to continual late . submission dates of key deliverables and escalating costs, which more . than doubled, the time frame stretched by three years.’ Scrapped: The £1.7million scheme was axed after Australian contractors pocketed huge amounts of cash without building any wind turbines, such as these in West Yorkshire (file picture) A DfID spokesman said: ‘Where contracts are not good value for money and are not being properly delivered, we will take action to protect taxpayer money. ‘The UK Government will be working with the Pitcairn Island government in order to assess the current and future energy needs, including green options such as solar power.’ But Robert Oxley, from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s frankly typical of DfID to waste so much taxpayers’ money on a project that delivers so little. ‘One of the consequences of spending up to an arbitrary aid target is that there is little incentive for officials to deliver value for taxpayers’ money. No one has been held to account for the repeated blunders over this project.’","Aid wasted trying to bring green electricity to community of 55 people .

"The National Science Foundation awarded a grant of nearly $700,000 in 2010 to a New York City theater company so it could write and produce a play about climate change. 'The play uses real places and stories drawn from interviews conducted by the artists to create an experience that is part investigative journalism and part inventive theater,' according to the grant's online description. 'Attendance at the performances is projected to be about 75,000.' 'The initiative ... intends to create and evaluate a new model for how theater can increase . public awareness, knowledge, and engagement with important . science-related societal issues,' according to the government bureaucrats who awarded the funds. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'The Great Immensity' opens in April, bringing a month of toe-tapping cynicism and sanctimony to a theater nowhere near Broadway . Climate change remains a major focus of the Obama administration, with the president discussing it Wednesday during a meeting with European Commission President Jose-Manuel Barroso (L) and European Council President Herman van Rompuy . 'The Great Immensity,' a play scheduled for an April 11 premiere in Brooklyn, is about a woman who hunts for a friend who disappeared from a tropical island. As she moves from place to place, she 'uncovers a mysterious plot surrounding the upcoming international climate summit,' reads an online plot summary. The National Science Foundation's online grants directory lists more awards for theater-related projects, including a $900,000 outlay for a 'live performance simulation system' called 'Virtual Vaudeville.' The theater company producing 'The Great Immensity' is The Civilians, a Brooklyn fixture whose artistic director Steve Crosson wrote and directs the play. Crosson received a 'social justice' award in 2013 from Dartmouth College, his alma mater. In an avant-garde snub, however, he didn't show up to receive it. The show's first musical number, called 'Margin of Error,' recounts global-warming poll numbers that the producers say 'were all reported by the New York Times.' 'Forty-four per cent' of Americans 'think that it should be more of a priority, but not if it costs too much, and less than health care or the economy,' reads one lyric. 'Thirty-six per cent think it's caused by humans – or maybe 47 per cent – or 51 per cent, maybe, think it's a combination of human and natural causes.' The song's one laugh line: 'Ten per cent believe the snow they shoveled last winter precludes any chance of climate change.' Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Science Committee, mocked the National Science Foundation on Wednesday for underwriting questionable projects with taxpayer dollars, and never explaining why . White House science czar John Holdren agreed that the National Science Foundation should be more 'transparent,' but wouldn't comment on the musical theater project or any other unusual grant awards . During a Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday, House Science Committee chair Rep. Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, quizzed White House 'science czar' John Holdren over the National Science Foundation's failure to explain the scientific value of a series of 'questionable' grants. In addition to the New York theater project, Smith pointed to a $340,000 grant 'to study the ecological consequences of early human-set fires in New Zealand,' a $50,000 survey of 'archived lawsuits in Peru from 1600-1700' and  a $20,000 expenditure of taxpayer money to study the '[c]auses of stress in Bolivia.' In a written opening statement, Holdren said that '[a]s past budgets from this Administration did, the President’s 2015 Budget proposes to invest intelligently in research, innovation, education, and infrastructure to lay the foundations for the industries, jobs, workforce, and environmental and national-security benefits of tomorrow.' 'But,of course, we need the continued support of the Congress to get it done.' Holdren declined to comment during the hearing on any of the specific grants Smith mentioned. Smith said Thursday that the Obama administration 'has not been as open and honest with the American people as it should' in its quest to reverse what it says is an earth-changing period of global warming. 'When the [Science] Committee asked the EPA for the scientific data being used to justify some of the costliest regulations in history, their response was that they didn’t have it even though they were using it.' Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore put climate change on the federal government's radar, back when it was called 'global warming' -- and won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for it .","'The Great Immensity' opens in April, funded by U.S. taxpayers .

"An Ohio man was charged with DUI after her was pulled over by the police, despite the fact that a breathalyzer test showed he had a blood-alcohol content of 0.000. 64-year-old Jessie Thornton who now lives in Surprise, Arizona said cops told him that they could tell he was drunk simply by looking at him. Mr Thornton explained that in the evenings, he runs errands and goes to the gym, but a late-night swim might have led to the DUI accusation. Scroll down for video... Jessie Thornton: He was arrested for DUI despite having nothing in his system . Surprise Police Department paperwork shows Thornton was 'pulled over for crossing the white line in his lane.' 'An officer walked up and he said ‘I can tell you’re driving DUI by looking in your eyes.’ I take my glasses off and he says, ‘You’ve got bloodshot eyes.’ I said, ‘I’ve been swimming at LA Fitness,’ and he says, ‘I think you’re DUI … we’re going to do a sobriety test.’ I said, ‘OK, but I got bad knees and a bad hip with surgery in two days.’ Thornton was indeed scheduled to have hip surgery two days later. No surprise: Mr Thornton says he is being harassed by local police having been pulled over 10 times . 'I couldn’t even sit on the ground like that and they knew it and I was like laying on the ground, then they put me in the back of an SUV and when I asked the officer to move her seat up ’cause my hip hurt she told me to stop whining.' Thornton said two other officers arrived and they conducted the sobriety test. With a BAC of 0.000, the situation should have been resolved quickly, but Thornton was evaluated for possible drug use as well. 'Yes, I do the breathalyzer and it comes back zero, zero, zero,' said Mr Thornton. Bloodshot: Mr Thornton told police his eyes were likely red because he had just come from the local swimming pool . While in custody, a 'DRE' or drug recognition expert is called in to test him. 'After he did all the tests, he says, 'I would never have arrested you, you show no signs of impairment.' 'I've been stopped 10 times in Surprise and given four tickets, it's amazing,' said Mr Thornton. No evidence: Mr Thornton was released after police found no evidence of alcohol in his blood, however his car was still impounded for three days. He is now suing the Surprise police department . 'I then get this message that my license is being suspended and I have to take some sort of drinking class or something,' he said. Mr Thornton now claims that it wasn't DUI but motivated by race. 'It was driving while black,' he proclaimed. 'I just don't want any of this to happen to somebody else,' he said. His latest incident with Surprise police officers prompted him to hire a lawyer with plans to sue the department for $500,000.","Jessie Thornton has been pulled over ten times since moving to Surprise .

"Videoed: Former minister Tim Yeo was filmed appearing to boast that he had previously coached a paying client in private . A Tory MP has complained about a government global-warming adviser’s undisclosed green interests – despite the fact he himself is paid a fortune by eco-energy and transport firms. Tim Yeo, chairman of the Energy and Climate Change select committee, has protested about Lord Deben remaining chairman of Veolia Water UK while also chairing the Committee on Climate Change, an independent body that advises the Government on the impact of climate change. Mr Yeo’s critics will argue his protest smacks of hypocrisy as he has been paid more than £400,000 by three green companies since 2009. Lord Deben, John Selwyn Gummer – who as Agriculture Minister in 1990 tried to persuade his daughter Cordelia to eat a hamburger during the BSE crisis – was required to undergo a ‘confirmation hearing’ before Yeo’s committee last September after being appointed chair of the Climate Change Committee. At the time Lord Deben had stepped down from his job as chairman of Forewinds, a consortium set up to build a hugely subsidised windfarm, but he remained chairman of Veolia Water UK. Asked at the hearing whether this could be a conflict of interest, Lord Deben said he had resigned  from all his energy business interests, adding: ‘If you look at what it [Veolia] does, it really has no connection at  all. And if I thought it even had a remote connection, I would make that change [resign].’ But, as this newspaper revealed in January, Veolia has a thriving eco business connecting windfarms to the National Grid. Mr Yeo has set out his protest in a letter to Energy Secretary Mr Davey. He wrote: ‘The committee was given to understand that Veolia was not an energy company, and that Lord Deben would not retain links with energy companies .  .  . But, as is clear from Veolia’s website and annual report and accounts, the company has a significant role in the field of energy.’ Mr Yeo added: ‘The lack of clarity on this specific point has caused ongoing media criticism .  .  . the reassurances you have given are not sufficient to effectively address the perception of conflict of interest in the public domain.’ Mr Yeo has been paid £402,033.88 by . three green companies since August 2009. He is paid many thousands more . as a director of the Channel Tunnel Company. The . ‘Chunnel’ contains a cable whose purpose is to keep Britain’s lights on . using French power if our own supply becomes inadequate following the . shutdown of coal stations caused by green restrictions. Lord . Deben yesterday continued to insist he had ‘no dealings whatsoever’ with the Veolia division that dealt with energy. He added: ‘Since being . made aware of this activity, I have ensured that I will never be . involved, receive any papers, or participate in any way.’ Fresh Storm: As Agriculture Minister in 1990 Lord Deben, John Selwyn Gummer, tried to persuade his daughter Cordelia to eat a hamburger during the BSE crisis . Energy and Climate Change secretary Ed Davey used a speech at the Met Office last week to mount an extraordinary and intemperate attack on newspapers such as this one, claiming we have published misleading 'destructive scepticism' and ignoring the science on global warming. Here our correspondent writes an open letter in reply: it is Mr Davey DAVID ROSE says, who is being less than straight with the facts. Dear Ed . Last week you made a speech which sounded uncomfortably as if you wanted to shut this newspaper up. You said that journalists like me, who have raised serious questions about global warming and energy policy, were ‘selectively misreading the evidence’ and arguing that ‘we can relax and burn all the dirty fuel we want’. You claimed that instead of publishing ‘the serious science’, we were propagating ‘destructive and loudly clamouring scepticism, born of vested interest.’ Worse still, in your eyes, we have suggested that your policies as Energy and Climate Change Secretary  are ‘hopelessly misguided’ because we oppose the vast increases in ‘renewable’ energy subsidies which you set out in your Energy Bill. Outburst: Energy and Climate Change secretary Ed Davey used a speech at the Met Office to mount an extraordinary and intemperate attack on newspapers . The Mail on Sunday was the only publication which you mentioned by name. So I hope you won’t mind when I point out that much of your speech was highly misleading. It was a Grade-A example of how those in power have become entrenched and wilfully blind to new evidence – of how you seek to crush debate by attacking opponents by mischaracterising what we actually say. According to you, we ‘reject outright that climate change is  a result of human activity’. You commented contemptuously: ‘It’s the science, stupid!’ After all, a recent survey found that 97 per cent of a sample of 12,000 climate science papers accept that human activity – increased carbon dioxide emissions – has contributed to global warming. How could we be so dumb as to ignore a consensus like that? You, you said, are ‘with the 97 per cent’.Well, Mr Davey, so am I, as are almost all the climate sceptics and so-called ‘deniers’ I have ever spoken to. The point is: yes, human activity has warmed the planet, and will probably continue to do so. The far more difficult questions are how far and how fast is this likely to happen? And here the scientific consensus is heading in one direction – towards the view that the world is warming rather more slowly than was thought only a few years ago. As this newspaper first reported in October, world temperatures have failed to show any statistically significant increase since 1997. According to you, this is a ‘false summit’, after which warming will again become rampant. But surely you must also know that this . unexpected ‘pause’ was not predicted by most climate computer models. Professor Judith Curry of the Georgia Technical Institute testified at  a . US Congressional hearing that it is likely to last for at least another . ten years. If it does, climate alarmism – all your talk of a ‘massive . gamble with the planet our children will inherit’ – is going to look, . well, stupid. Load of hot air: Professor Myles Allen, head of Oxford University¿s Climate Research Network, has said that billions are being wasted on measures including windfarms in Scotland . Your mention of The Mail on Sunday came when you quoted an article two weeks ago by Professor Myles Allen, head of Oxford University’s Climate Research Network. Yes, Prof Allen did say that ‘almost everyone agrees’ that emissions have to come down. But he went on to add that we are wasting billions on policies – that’s your policies, Mr Davey – which will never achieve this end. He says: ‘90 per cent of the measures adopted since the 1997 Kyoto agreement to cut global emissions are a waste of time and money – including windfarms in Scotland, carbon taxes and Byzantine carbon trading systems.’ In your speech, you implied that if we set ever more ambitious targets covering our own pitiful two per cent of world emissions, one day those much bigger economies will follow suit. Oh really? Right now, China and India have about 800 coal power stations being built or on order. We need a proper debate about these issues, one which isn’t fuelled by alarmism and which appreciates that your opponents have valid viewpoints, too. But all you have to offer is more of the same: bigger doses of policy prescriptions – taxes, subsidies and the futile quest for a binding global agreement – which have demonstrably failed. There is a cost for this. Britain already has the highest inflation in energy prices in Europe (which actually means the world). Yet everything you are doing will increase this further. Perhaps you think that if you maintain the scaremongering at  a shrill enough volume, you’ll get away with it. Maybe in the short term you will. History, and the ballot box in 2015, may not be as kind. Yours sincerely . David .","Tim Yeo has complained about Lord Deben's undisclosed green interests .

"She's just days from giving birth but even impending motherhood couldn't keep Zara Phillips away from her beloved horses. The Olympic silver medallist was on hand to monitor her equine charges as they were put through their paces during the Heythrop Hunt Point-to-Point races in Gloucestershire. The 32-year-old, whose first child is due this month, was later spotted making her way through the paddock to a vantage point on the sidelines and watched intently as her runners flashed past. Not long now: Zara Phillips makes her way through the paddock at the Heythrop Hunt Point-to-Point . Ready to pop: The 32-year-old royal is just days away from the birth of her first child . Wrapped in a cosy parka, complete with a fashionably furry hood, the fresh-faced mother-to-be appeared less than impressed with their performance but still managed to summon up a smile for the watching crowds. Although rugby player husband Mike Tindall was nowhere to be seen, the royal wasn't short of company and was seen laughing and joking with friends during gaps in the programme. Phillips, who is a trainer in addition to being a successful eventer, had three horses entered for the event, among them, the hotly tipped Devils Boy [sic] who appeared in the first race of the day. Other entries included Calusa Comet, a six-year-old Irish bay, and Fiddle Faddle, a horse owned by her mother, The Princess Royal. Oh no! Miss Phillips appeared less than impressed with the performance of her trio of horses . Fresh-faced: The mother-to-be was spotted enjoying a joke with friends from the sidelines . Cosy: Mrs Brooks and her one-year-old daughter Scarlett were both well wrapped up against the January chill . And Ms Phillips wasn't the only notable name to appear at the event. Also watching the races was former News International boss, Rebekah Brooks. Mrs Brooks, who along with David Cameron has previously turned out to hunt with the Heythrop, was seen watching from the sidelines, her daughter Scarlett in her arms. Despite looking pale, perhaps as a result of the ongoing phone-hacking trial, Mrs Brooks brightened up her look with a jaunty orange scarf, which she wore with a cosy padded jacket and a pair of tweed breeks. Elegant: The Queen plumped for a chic turquoise ensemble but once again refused to accept posies . While Princess Anne was nowhere to be seen, despite having a horse entered in the races, another royal to brave the cold was the Queen, who was seen arriving at St Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham this morning for the Sunday service. Much to the surprise of onlookers, the Queen, who was colourfully dressed in a turquoise ensemble, once more refused to accept flowers from waiting children, and left the honours to a lady-in-waiting. By contrasts, the Duke of Edinburgh was in fine fettle and beamed at well-wishers as he arrived at the village church on foot. With a new great grandson or daughter just days away, the Duke could have something else to smile about come next Sunday. Good spirits: The Duke of Edinburgh was on fine form as he walked with members of the Royal Household .

"Tammy Smith has become the first openly gay officer to be promoted to the ranks of Brigadier General in the U.S. Army. Smith's promotion took place on Friday in a private ceremony at the Women’s Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. She received her stars from wife, Tracey Hepner, the first time her longtime partner was officially recognized as her significant other at a military gathering. Smith is assigned as deputy chief in the Army Reserve Office of the Chief in Washington, D.C. Promotion: U.S. Army Brigadier General Tammy Smith has become the first openly gay flag officer to come out while currently serving in the U.S. military. Smith received her stars from her wife Tracey Hepner (left) Her promotion comes less than a year after the implementation of the repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' (DADT), the policy enacted in 1993 under U.S. President Bill Clinton. The policy prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing closeted homosexual or bisexual service members or applicants, while barring openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons from military service. Pinned: U.S. Army Brigadier General Tammy Smith receives her stars from longtime partner Tracey Hepner . After much debate that the policy was discriminatory, the U.S. Congress voted to end it with the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on December 22, 2010 and full implementation of the repeal occurred on September 20, 2011. Army Strong: U.S. Army Brigadier General Tammy Smith said despite the milestone of her appointment as an openly gay officer, 'what is relevant is upholding Army values' But Smith, 49, downplayed the milestone of her appointment in a post DADT military, in an interview with Stars and Stripes newspaper. 'All of those facts are irrelevant,' she said. 'I don’t think I need to be focused on that. What is relevant is upholding Army values and the responsibility this carries... For me, the story is about the promotion and the opportunities it brings.' She did concede though, in an earlier interview, that the repeal of the policy meant that she and her partner 'will be able to go out and have drinks together without worrying.' 'The support we’ve received has been amazing,' Hepner told the paper.  'I wasn’t . surprised that people were so accepting, but in some cases it has been . even celebratory. It’s like nothing has really changed for us, and yet . everything has changed.' Hepner is a gay activist and co-founded the Military Partners and Families Coalition, which advocates for benefits and military programs for same-sex partners. Smith is not the first gay general officer but most have disclosed their sexual orientation after their retirement or discharge under 'don't ask, don't tell.'

"Lu Ann Ballew was terminated from the Tennessee court on Friday . A Tennessee magistrate has been replaced months after ordering a baby's name changed from Messiah to Martin because she believes Messiah is a title held only by Jesus Christ. Lu Ann Ballew was a child support magistrate, serving at the pleasure of the chief judge of Tennessee's fourth judicial district. Judge Duane Slone terminated Ballew on Friday and appointed a new magistrate. He did not return calls seeking comment, and his order does not explain why he ended Ballew's appointment. Ballew, an attorney, still faces a March 3 hearing on accusations that she violated Tennessee's Code of Judicial Conduct, according to WBIR. Among other things, the code requires judges to perform all duties without bias or prejudice based on religion. Ballew's August name change decision was overturned at a September hearing. Ballew ordered the name change during a paternity hearing in Newport on August 8. At the time, the parents were disputing the 8-month-old baby's surname.

"A touching photograph shared in time for Father's Day has revealed the incredible bond between a Utah dad and his disabled son. The image, which was released by the U.S. Department of the Interior, shows James Geier, from Logan, pulling his quadriplegic son Jonah through the Arches National Park in Utah on a stroller. The eighteen-year-old, who has cerebral palsy, adores being outside, so his 60-year-old dad has made it possible for him to see the nation's most breathtaking sights since he was born. Mr Geier, a retired law enforcement officer, hiked . three miles pulling Jonah nearly 500 feet over rock . trails and up steps so that his son could experience the best views at Arches National Park. Touching: In a photograph that has warmed hearts, James Geier pulls his 18-year-old son Jonah, who has cerebral palsy, through the Arches National Park in Utah on a special stroller . 'We . just have a special relationship with Jonah, my wife and I,' the proud dad told Today. 'He's really . kind of a best friend as well as our son. He's probably the best . company that you can have.' The photograph was taken by his daughter, Laura, two years ago but warmed hearts this weekend when it was shared by the Department of Interior on their Instagram page. Since then, it has been 'liked' more than 10,000 times and has garnered more than 200 comments calling the image 'pure love' and 'so touching'. Laura originally submitted the photograph to the annual 'Share the Experience' photo contest, but the department decided to share it again this past weekend. 'Best friends': Jonah has always loved being outdoors, so his family makes sure he never misses out . Close: His big sister Laura, pictured, took the photograph two years ago but it was a hit this weekend when the U.S. Department of Interior shared it on its Instagram page in time for Father's Day . 'We thought this is such a great photo for Father’s Day - it just kind of shows what Father's Day is all about,' Time Fullerton, the director of digital strategy, told Today. James Geier . The Geier family, who have been hiking since their children were young, have visited Capitol Reef National Park and returned to Arches since the photograph was taken. 'He enjoys it completely,' Mr Geier said of Jonah. Mr Geier used to carry Jonah in a child carrier . but when he started to weigh more . than 70 pounds, he found the Dixon Roller pack, which was . modified with a webbed sling seat for Jonah. Loving: Retired police officer Mr Geier, pictured with Laura, takes Jonah on between 8 and 10 hikes a year . 'Pure love': More than 10,000 people have liked the photograph on the department's Instagram page . He said the . visit to Arches was the first time he tried out the system and he had . no trouble pulling his excited teen through the breathtaking landscape. When Laura initially submitted the photograph, she said that 'neither Geier nor Arch is deterred by challenges'. 'Perseverance,' she wrote. 'Shared by both the Arch in withstanding time and change, and the resolve of a father to hike his disabled son to the Arch to experience the incredible symbol of natural beauty and strength.'","James Geier, 60, is pictured pulling his son Jonah, who has cerebral palsy, through Arches National Park in Utah on a specially-made stroller .

"Heroics: Juliana, a Great Dane, leapt into action after the device fell through the roof of her owner's house . Bombs rained down and flames roared through the streets as the Luftwaffe launched wave after wave  of attacks. It was 1941, and the house where Juliana the Great Dane lived with her owner was one of the unlucky ones. An incendiary bomb ripped through the roof, and would have destroyed everything – if it hadn’t been, it seems, for Juliana’s well-timed need to spend a penny. She is thought to have relieved herself over the bomb, defusing it and saving the house. Her actions in the middle of the Blitz earned her a Blue Cross Medal. But that was only the first time Juliana demonstrated her  firefighting skills during the  Second World War. Three years later, she received a second Blue Cross Medal – awarded for animal bravery – when she alerted customers to a fire tearing through her owner’s shoe shop. Her story was only revealed when auctioneers conducted a house clearance at a property in Bristol and discovered the second medal, along with a portrait of Juliana. A plaque attached to the portrait reads: ‘Juliana – awarded a medal for extinguishing an incendiary bomb April 1941. Awarded another for alerting the occupants of  her master’s burning shop November 1944.’ The medal and portrait sold at auction for £1,100, more than 18 times the pre-sale estimate. Philip Taubenheim, auctioneer at Wotton Auction Rooms in Gloucestershire, said: ‘We are constantly finding treasures during house clearouts, many with fascinating stories behind them. This medal and portrait are a perfect example. ‘They were found at two different stages of a house clearance at a property in Bristol that belonged to a relative of Juliana’s owner. ‘We united the two and were able to lift the lid on an incredible story. Interesting: Her fascinating story was only revealed when auctioneers conducted a house clearance in Bristol . Wreckage: King George VI inspects bomb damage in Bristol on a visit in December 1940. Earlier in the month the city had been hit by two major attacks during the Second World War . The Blitz (from the German word, 'lightning') was the most intense bombing campaign Britain has ever seen. Between September 1940 and May 1941 there were major raids with more than 100 tonnes of high explosives dropped on 16 British cities. London was attacked 71 times and bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights. Birmingham, Liverpool and Plymouth were also hit eight times, Bristol six, Glasgow five, Southampton four, Portsmouth three, and there was also at least one large raid on another eight cities. ‘The inscription on the Blue Cross . Medal states it was presented to Juliana, a Great Dane, after she warned . her master of a fire that was tearing through his shop in 1944. ‘As . if that wasn’t amazing enough, the plaque on the framed portrait of . Juliana revealed she had been awarded another Blue Cross award . previously in 1941. That time she was given the award for putting out an . incendiary bomb that had crashed through the roof of her owner’s house. ‘I’ve . never heard of a dog being able to extinguish a bomb before – one can . only assume this was a Great Dane with a great bladder.’ He added: ‘These items tell a fantastic story and highlight the often-forgotten role that animals played in the war.’ But . Juliana’s story had an unhappy ending. She died only  a year after the . war ended – killed by poison posted through her  owner’s letterbox.","Juliana extinguished flame on bomb when it fell into house in 1941 .

"Beaming: Ruth Wright, 48, was able to avoid a hysterectomy thanks to MR-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery . A revolutionary no-knife procedure  is being used to treat fibroids – and it  could save thousands of women from a hysterectomy. It uses a high-energy, focused ultrasound beam to heat and destroy the fibroid without the need for invasive surgery and anaesthetic – resulting in a far shorter recovery time. The beam is guided through continuous Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that allows the surgical team to see inside the body. ‘This is a revolutionary procedure,’ says consultant interventional radiologist Dr Paul Crowe, who offers the treatment at Spire Parkway hospital in Birmingham. He has treated 15 cases so far in collaboration with consultant gynaecologist Shirin Irani. ‘As well as needing no general anaesthetic, it is non-invasive. Recovery is faster and there are few risks of complication or side effects.’ Fibroids are common tumours on the wall of the uterus and are usually benign. ‘About 25 per cent of women of child-bearing age have them, and up to 40 per cent in later life,’ says Dr Crowe. ‘Although some women have no idea they even have them, a substantial number need treatment.’ Treatment is recommended if the fibroids cause symptoms, which can include heavy bleeding, pressure  on the bladder or bowel – meaning increased urination, bloating or constipation – or fertility problems. ‘There is an association with early miscarriage, or in later pregnancy there may be a problem with space,’ says Dr Crowe. ‘It’s not known why they cause heavy bleeding but they grow in response to oestrogen.’ Most treatments involve surgery, with many women having a hysterectomy – removal of the uterus. Half the 50,000 hysterectomies done on the NHS every year are fibroid-related. This operation can take two hours under general anaesthetic, requires a hospital stay and patients can take eight weeks to recover. Company director Ruth Wright, 48, was advised to have a hysterectomy when she developed fibroids. She had been suffering heavy bleeding. ‘Some days I couldn’t leave the bathroom,’ she says. ‘It was a nightmare. I was dragging myself to work every day, through the school run and supper, and couldn’t ride my beloved horses for more than ten minutes without being exhausted.’ After several months, her doctor found she was anaemic and prescribed Depo-Provera, a progesterone contraceptive injection that often stops periods altogether. When that didn’t work, Ruth had a scan. ‘The radiologist said I had fibroids so large it was as if I was carrying an 18-week foetus,’ she recalls. How it is done: MSgFUS uses a high-energy, focused ultrasound beam to heat and destroy the fibroid without the need for invasive surgery and anaesthetic . The gynaecologist recommended a hysterectomy. ‘I was convinced there must be another solution. I couldn’t bear more time away from work and my family. I went home and sat at my laptop – when I found the new procedure it seemed ideal.’ The MR-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) can be done in a few hours under light sedation. Symptoms start to diminish immediately. The NHS was happy to consider funding MRgFUS for Ruth, but she couldn’t face waiting so had it privately. After light sedation, the patient lies very still on the stomach in an MRI scanner with the fibroid directly over the ultrasound. The surgical team plot and guide the treatment from a control room using the MRI console. ‘It wasn’t the most fun four hours,’ says Ruth. ‘But I wasn’t in any pain. You have to stay completely still but the main problem is feeling chilly and a bit bored. Every now and again the ultrasound beam bounces off  the pelvis and you feel discomfort. But I had a button to press if this happened, and the second I did so they moved the beam. I went home and had an excellent night’s sleep with just a couple of painkillers.’ Two days later the bleeding had eased significantly, and continued to tail off over the following weeks. Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Clive Spence-Jones says: ‘The science is excellent, with good clinical trials, and could be fantastic in certain situations. Though fibroids have to be on the front of the uterus with no bowel in between and can’t be too large. The procedure is likely to become popular.’ Dr Crowe adds: ‘Occasionally there may be some redness, minor pain, skin burns or bruising. These usually resolve within ten days.’ The treated fibroids will not grow back but there is a small risk of new ones growing. ‘I went in on the Thursday and was back at work on Monday,’ says Ruth. ‘My life has been changed.’ spirehealthcare.com/parkway .","New no-knife procedure could save thousands from hysterectomy .

"The National Trust may be best known for country estates and cream teas, but the trust's new exhibition will take place in a council flat in east London. In 1967 the Balfron Tower, in Poplar, was completed and for two months the following year its architect, Erno Goldfinger, lived in apartment 130 to prove how desirable his new building was. Now, as part of a display on Brutalist architecture, the National Trust has restored the flat to its original 1960s style, and is inviting the public to look around. As part of an exhibition on Brutalist architecture, the National Trust has given flat 130 at the top of Balfron Tower in east London a 1960s makeover and will be opening it up to the public from October 1 . The tower was completed in 1967, and the following year it's designer, Erno Goldfinger, moved into flat 130 in an attempt to demonstrate the appeal of high-rise living . A spokesman for the Trust said: 'Balfron Tower, along with its younger sister Trellick Tower, is a testament to a particular moment in time when a vision of a utopian post-war Britain coincided with Brutalism – an architectural movement that changed the landscape of our urban environment. 'This was intended to be a heroic architecture that sought to offer the best of design to the masses and to free people from the slum housing and poor conditions still prevalent in 1960s Britain.' Designer Wayne Hemingway and his daughter Tilly scoured market stalls, auctions and eBay in order to give the flat and authentic 1960s look. Everything, from the LPs stacked on shelves, to the Beatles bed cover, and posters of Twiggy in the teenage bedroom is from the period. For smaller items, such as the bottle of aftershave and can of Gillette in the bathroom, the pair were forced to raid the Land Of Lost Content museum, in Shropshire. Goldfinger was born in Hungary but emigrated to Paris after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and moved to Britain in 1934 after marrying Ursula Blackwell, heiress to the Crosse and Blackwell food company fortune. Goldfinger (left), a Hungarian communist, moved to Britain in 1934. He designed the headquarters of the British Communist Party, before building the Balfron Tower and its sister building, the Trellick Tower. James Bond author Ian Fleming so hated Goldfinger that the writer named one of his villains after him . Designer Wayne Hemingway and his daughter Tilly scoured auctions, markets and eBay to give the flat an authentic Sixties feel. Everything from the furniture, to the wallpaper, and even the board games, is from the period . A supporter of communism, he spent his years before the Second World War living  in Highgate, and after the conflict  began designing buildings for the likes of the Daily Worker newspaper and the British Communist Party. For Goldfinger, who was so despised by James Bond author Ian Fleming that the writer adopted his name for a villain in his books, high rise living was the future of Britain in the Sixties. He saw building upwards as a way to keep more green space open for people to enjoy at ground level, a mission he shared with the founder of the National Trust, Octavia Hill. He also saw high rise towers as a way to solve the chronic lack of housing in post-Second World War Britain, and move the poor out of slums and into better quality apartments. The Balfron was his first experiment with tower blocks, having built several terraced homes in Hampstead, north west London, including his own house at 2 Williow Road, which the National Trust also looks after. It was the design of this property that first drew the anger of Fleming, after he opposed the demoluition of several cottages  to make way for it. Goldfinger saw high-rise living as a way to provide low-cost housing to the poor and  solve the chronic lack of homes in post-war Britain, while also keeping green space . For smaller items, such as records, a bottle of aftershave and a can of Gillette, the designers also raided the Land Of Lost Content museum, in Shropshire . The block would later be used as a blueprint the blueprint for its sister building, the Trellick Tower in west London, and sparked a wave of copy-cat buildings across the country. However, while apartments in the Trellick Tower now sell for upwards of £500,000, Balfron became known for violence, crime and poverty. Balfron itself is in the process of being renovated, with current residents being housed elsewhere until the building is finished. Council tenants who want to move back in will be allowed to do so, while those who want to leave will be rehomed, and their flats sold off to private investors. The apartments currently sell for £155,000. The Balfron Tower pop-up exhibition will run for two weeks, beginning on October 1. Ticketsare available here. While Balfron Tower sparked a wave of copy-cat social housing across the country, as an experiment in high-rise living it ultimately proved a failure, becoming synonymous with poverty, crime and violence .","Erno Goldfinger designed Balfron Tower in east London and lived in flat 130 on the top floor for two months in 1968 .

"A Pakistani former dancing girl left fighting for life by a 'horrific' acid attack has committed suicide a decade after being heavily facially disfigured. Fakhra Younus, 33, leapt to her death from a sixth floor building in Rome 12 years after the acid attack which she said left her looking 'not human'. At the time of her attack in May 2000, her ex-husband Bilal Khar was the man accused of entering her mother's house and pouring acid over Younus's face as she slept. Life-changing: Fakhra Younus, pictured left before the horrific acid attack in May 2000, was left heavily facially disfigured after having acid thrown in her face . The attack, which took place in front of Younus's then five-year-old son, left her unable to breathe and fighting for life. Her nose was almost completely melted and she has since undergone 39 separate surgical procedures to repair her disfigured face over the past decade. The horrific attack also burned off her hair, fused her lips, blinded her in one eye, destroyed her left ear and melted her breasts. After being rushed to hospital she said, 'My face is a prison to me', while her distraught young son said at the time, 'This is not my mother'. Disfigured: Younus, left, pictured with supporter Tehmina Durrani, has undergone 39 separate surgical operations to repair the damage done to her face . The mother-of-one moved to Italy after the incident to live in Rome and continue her treatment. But on March 17 she took her own life, after leaving a message saying she was committing suicide over the silence of law on the atrocities and the insensitivity of Pakistani rulers. Cleared: Younus's ex-husband Bilal Khar, the son of a wealthy Pakistani governor, was cleared in 2003 of charges relating to the attack . Bilal Khar was arrested in 2002 and charged with attempted murder following the attack, only to be released on bail after five months. Khar, an ex-parliamentarian and son of a wealthy Pakistani governor, was eventually cleared of the attack, though many believe he could have used his family connections to escape conviction. After Younus's tragic suicide emerged earlier this month, Khar continued to deny having any part in the attack - claiming in a television interview a different man with the same name had carried out the crime. Khar claimed his ex-wife killed herself because she didn't have enough money, not because of her horrific injuries. More than 8,500 acid attacks, forced marriages and other forms of violence against women were reported in Pakistan in 2011, according to The Aurat Foundation, a women's rights organization. The Pakistani government introduced new laws last year criminalising acid attacks and stating that convicted attacks would serve at least 14 years in jail. Tehmina Durrani, the ex-wife of Bilal Khar's father, had become an advocate for Younus after the attack, and said the acid attack victim had pledged to bring her attacker to justice when she had recovered. Mourning: Fakhra Younus's body is carried through Karachi airport in her native Pakistan after her body was returned to the country from Italy . Grief: Family members of Fakhra Younus cannot hide their anguish at Karachi airport as the acid attack victim's body was returned to Pakistan . Durrani said: 'She said, 'When I come back, I will reopen the case, and I'll fight myself,"" and she was a fighter.' Durrani said Younus' case should be a reminder that the Pakistani government needs to do much more to prevent acid attacks and other forms of violence against women, and also help the victims. 'I think this whole country should be extremely embarrassed that a foreign country took responsibility for a Pakistani citizen for 13 years because we could give her nothing, not justice, not security,' said Durrani.","Fakhra Younus said 'My face is a prison' after attack which melted her nose .

"The word schmeat – a form of meat produced synthetically from biological tissue – made it on to the shortlist for the Oxford Dictionaries’ word of the year. The word is rarely used, but its very inclusion in the shortlist reflects the long-term significance of the events that occurred in London in August, when the world’s first lab-grown hamburger – developed by a team at Maastricht University in the Netherlands – was cooked and served. It’s a vital development, because current meat production methods are not sustainable and meeting global demand is becoming become increasingly difficult. The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that demand for meat will increase by more than two-thirds over the next 40 years. Burgers could soon be both healthy and sustainable produced, according to Dr Emma Davies, a food scientist . The Dutch scientists responsible for the first schmeat predict ‘cultured’ meats (ones grown artificially) could be commercially available within 10 to 20 years. ‘With the current technology, we can make the meat at a reasonable price and that will only come down as we improve the production process,’ says lead scientist Professor Mark Post. ‘There are still a few technical hurdles, but they require just work and time, and the outcome is reasonably predictable.’ Although the team say synthetic meat is biologically the same, it will need to replicate its appearance closely to tempt doubters. Cultured beef is currently white, and coloured using beetroot. Professor Post’s team are now working on cultivating fat tissue and increasing levels of the pigment myoglobin, which gives meat its colour. This would offer a more authentic flavour and appearance. But beef patties aren’t the only part of our diet to attract the attention of food scientists. In the future, every aspect of a burger – from the bun to the relish – could be modified to make it more sustainable. What’s more, it could even become something of a health food. The science is tantalisingly close to delivering, but any new GM foods would have to overcome a raft of regulations, particularly in Europe. In London in August, the world's first lab-grown hamburger (pictured) - which was developed by a team at Maastricht University in the Netherlands - was cooked and served . Health-boosting purple tomatoes . A team from the John Innes Centre in Norwich, UK, has engineered tomatoes using genes from the snapdragon flower to give an extra helping of pigments called anthocyanins. These have an anti-inflammatory effect in the body. In tests, the tomatoes slowed the progression of soft-tissue carcinoma in cancer-prone mice. The tomatoes and juice will not be available commercially until regulatory approval, which could be as soon as two years in North America, says lead researcher Professor Cathie Martin. Cultured beef . Muscle stem cells from cattle have been cultured in a nutrient broth by researchers at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, and then mixed with collagen so they formed strips of muscle tissue – the main component of meat. These were then ‘bulked up’ with electrical stimulation, before being minced up and shaped into a patty. A total of 20,000 muscle strips are needed to create just one burger. Dr Davies says creating lab grown meat (pictured) is a vital development because current meat production methods are not sustainable and meeting global demand is becoming become increasingly difficult . Diabetes-treating lettuce . Dr Henry Daniell, a molecular biologist at the University of Pennsylvania, works on delivering drugs using plants. He has created lettuces genetically engineered to express a protein that stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin. Tests on mice given freeze-dried ‘super lettuce’ have shown promising results. Allergy-free milk . Milk allergies are often caused by a protein called beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), which is not present in human milk. A New Zealand team has used genetic engineering to create a cow that produces BLG-free milk. They are currently creating more cows with the same genetics using reproductive technologies analogous to human IVF treatment. The article is featured in this month's edition of Science Uncovered magazine . Reinforced Bread . In 2012, scientists from the UK, Germany and the U.S. deciphered wheat’s complex genetic code, identifying about 96,000 genes. The work paves the way to breeding wheat varieties with higher yields, more disease resistance, and increased ability to cope with drought and other climate-related stresses. Creepy-crawly cuisine is coming . Insects are highly nutritious and heading to a dinner plate near you. The idea of eating tangles of muscle from a Petri dish may be unpalatable to some. Even less appealing, however, may be the idea of devouring insects, deep-fried or otherwise. Yet in restaurants from London to Sydney, insects are proving quite a hit with a niche audience keen to eat delights such as grasshoppers, locusts, crickets and scorpions (heat-treated, of course, to remove the toxins). Insects actually form part of the traditional diets of at least two billion people worldwide, according to The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations. There’s no escaping the fact that they are good for you. A recent FAO report points to the benefits of eating insects. They are high in fat, protein, fibre, and key minerals and vitamins, from iron and calcium to B vitamins and vitamin E. Crucially, insects have a negligible impact on the environment. They are cold-blooded and very efficient at converting feed to protein, not using energy to maintain their body temperature. They can also be fed on organic waste. So-called mini livestock also offer ‘livelihood opportunities’, says a recent FAO report on edible insects, meaning they could also be an ethical choice.

"A World War II vet would like to pay his taxes but the IRS insists he'd dead. Ohio man Siegfried Meinstein says that despite multiple attempts to convince the federal agency that he is, in fact, among the living, he has been unable to get someone to believe him. The 94-year-old lives in an assisted living facility not far from Columbus. Ohio man Siegfried Meinstein says that despite multiple attempts to convince the federal agency that he is, in fact, among the living, he has been unable to get someone to believe him . 'It isn’t really a problem in my daily life,' he told reporters. 'Everybody accepts my money.' Fox News reports that his family has given him good-humored teasing about it. 'If they keep insisting, what is it you say?' said his son, Ron Meinstein. 'Eventually, they’ll be right.' In April, Meinstein attempted to file a tax return online but the IRS rejected it saying he was deceased. A few days later he visited a Social Security office in Columbus which told them that they did not list him as a dead man, and gave him a letter to send to the IRS. The tax agency ended up sending it back to Social Security. In April, Meinstein attempted to file a tax return online but the IRS rejected it saying he was deceased . 'We are unable to process your tax return. Our records indicate that the person identified as the primary taxpayer…was deceased prior the tax year show on the tax form,' the IRS noted on a letter responding to Meinstein. The IRS has told journalists that their people get information from the office of Social Security and that that was the best venue to reach an understanding. They've also sent Meinstein a letter curious as to why he prepaid $14,000 in taxes in 2014, and telling him that they'd lost his latest tax return.","Ohio man Siegfried Meinstein claims the IRS don't believe he is still alive .

"Jeh Johnson announced heightened security measures at some federal buildings . Security will be increased at various federal government buildings in Washington and other major American cities, the Homeland Security Department announced Tuesday evening in what it described as a 'precautionary step.' The move came one week after a gunman in Ottawa fatally shot a soldier as he stood as a ceremonial guard at Ottawa's National War Memorial, then stormed the Parliament building. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the shooting a terrorist attack. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson would not identify the buildings where there will be an increased security presence or disclose the specific security measures to be taken by the Federal Protective Service, which protects more than 9,500 federal facilities visited daily by roughly 1.4 million people. But he said 'prudence dictates a heightened vigilance' to protect government buildings and workers. The specific security steps will vary from location to location and 'will be continually re-evaluated,' he said. 'The reasons for this action are self-evident: the continued public calls by terrorist organizations for attacks on the homeland and elsewhere, including against law enforcement and other government officials, and the acts of violence targeted at government personnel and installations in Canada and elsewhere recently,' Johnson said in a statement. He also called on law enforcement nationwide to be on the lookout for small-scale attacks, like the one in Canada, 'by a lone offender or a small group of individuals.' Canadian authorities have said the accused gunman in last week's attack, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was driven by ideological and political motives and made a video before the shooting talking about Canada's foreign policy and his religious beliefs. Secretary Jeh Johnson announced the move Tuesday, one week after a gunman in Ottawa shot a soldier ( and stormed Canada's seat of government. A Homeland Security official told CNN there is 'no new intelligence' suggesting that U.S. government buildings face additional threats, and emphasized that the changes are a 'precautionary measure' that only apply to buildings secured by the Federal Protective Service. Today U.S. Secretary of State John . Kerry said that the attack on the Canadian parliament . and the country's National War Memorial last week was clearly a terrorist act. 'Clearly, anybody who walks up in a premeditated way with a . loaded rifle and attacks someone in uniform then purposely goes . to a parliament, is committing, by common sense standards, a . terrorist act,' Kerry told a news briefing after talks in Ottawa . with his Canadian counterpart, Foreign Minister John Baird. Two days before the attack in Ottawa on Oct. 22, a car . driven by a man described by police as a homegrown radical ran . down two soldiers, killing one in Quebec. The attack has had ramifications across the world - in London armed soldiers have been deployed . at a top tourist attraction in the heart of the city's government . district as a precautionary measure after an Islamist gunman . attacked the Canadian parliament last week, a military source . said on Tuesday. The source told Reuters that the decision to deploy the . troops at the entrance to Horse Guards Parade in London's .

"At first glance, these photographs seem to show a scuba diver exploring the depths of an underwater world. But if you look more carefully you will see a tree, a bridge and even a park bench. In fact these incredible images show a diver traversing an Austrian lake that floods every year, covering everything in the surrounding area. Scroll down for video . Underwater: This picture shows scuba diver Marc Henauer exploring the beautiful Green Lake in Tragoess, Austria, which floods every year . Odd find: This tree stands out somewhat against the watery landscape. Gallons of melted snow water pour from the nearby Karst mountains to expand the lake . Soggy seat: A bench, usually used by visitors wishing to enjoy the stunning surrounding landscape, is submerged in freezing cold water . Set among the snowy Karst mountains, the Green Lake in Tragoess, Austria, is normally only one metre deep. For most of the year, visitors to the beauty spot can leisurely stroll around the picturesque lagoon, enjoying the stunning landscape from one of the benches set near the water's edge. They can wander down several footpaths and cross one of many small bridges. But every year when the snow melts, the lake floods and submerges everything surrounding it. Around twelve metres of water covers trees, footpaths, benches and bridges. Gallons of clear, 7°C water doubles its size from 2,000sq metres to over 4,000sq metres. Diver Marc Henauer, from Perly, Switzerland, heard about the natural phenomenon and came to explore the lake for himself. VIDEO COURTESY: SCUBADIVING.CZ . Remarkable: In this image, you can clearly see what would usually be a footpath meandering under a tree branch . Expansive: Every year the lake, which is usually only 1 metre deep, floods to any up to 12 metres in the deepest areas . Diver crossing: Marc Henauer crosses an underwater bridge, which usually only cover a small stream . The 39-year-old said: 'When I was underwater, it felt like I was swimming in a magical world, it was so beautiful. Swimming over the green grass, flowers, paths, rocks and trees was like being in a fairy tale. 'We were lucky that the sun created fantastic light rays through the water. My wife and I stayed there for seven days and we did three dives every day, spending one hour on each dive.' Mr Henauer, who works in central purchasing in Geneva, was thrilled with the set of photos. He added: 'All pictures were taken in . natural light without a flash.

"She shot to fame on Made In Chelsea as the resident fashionista with a penchant for pink hair, nose rings and cutting comments - most of which were directed at Lucy Watson. So it comes as no surprise that Phoebe-Lettice Thompson has chanelled her creativity into her own fashion range. The 23-year-old, who worked on Tatler's fashion desk during her time on the E4 show, has teamed up with London label Illustrated People to create her 22-piece debut range. Cool vibes: Phoebe-Lettice Thompson, who found . fame on Made In Chelsea, has designed a collection with Illustrated . People but refrained from modelling it herself because 'that would be . naff,' she says . Speaking to MailOnline about her 'easy and accessible' new collection, which ranges in price from £35-£65, Phoebe said: 'The inspiration stems from my fascination with the vibrant Tokyo fashion scene and the Harajuku girls living there. 'I love Gwen Stefani's style, it really resonates with me so I channelled it into this range.' Fashion background: Phoebe, left, was inspired by the cool girls of Tokyo, right, when it came to designing her new range, right, which is priced between £35-£65 . Far east: Phoebe's self-styled campaign was shot in East London, where she hunted for 'badass' models to be her clothes horses . Phoebe's urban-inspired collection is filled with gingham co-ords, masculine shorts and chic 90s silhouettes. 'I've combined the random, the good with the bad, to get something quite strange,' she says of the range, which juxtaposes grotesque imagery such as bloody eyeballs with pretty pastels. Unlike . many celebrities, who simply put their name to a brand, Phoebe, who . began working in a couture house at 16, maintains that she has done . everything herself. 'I'm totally confident, I know how it works so they . let me do exactly what I wanted,' she explained. Speaking . about her personal style, Phoebe, who cites Moschino, Balmain and . Meadham Kirchhoff as her go-to labels, said: 'My dress sense is weird. I . dress how I feel and I love wearing pieces that no one else has. Creative control: Unlike many celebrities, who simply put their name to a brand, Phoebe did everything herself from scouting the models to shooting the campaign . Cool kids: Phoebe chose models who 'are hot but would beat you up' to model her urban range . 'I think clothes are a really good talking point and can be an ice breaker. When I was younger, I was such a cyber goth. My mother wouldn't let me dye my hair.' Phoebe, who loves shopping on eBay and in Topshop, cites Paris Hilton, Azealia Banks and Angel Haze as her style icons and says that she'd love to see 'cool girls' like Jourdan Dunn wearing her clothes. She refrained from modelling herself because, she says, 'I'm not a model and it would be naff if I did it.' Instead, she scoured East London for some really 'badass' models, the type who 'are hot but would beat you up,' she says. Inspired: Phoebe used The 'Kawaii' - a distinct Japanese theme meaning cute - as her inspiration and had everything shipped over from Japan . Avid Made In Chelsea fans will notice that Phoebe is distinctly absent this season. 'I left at the end of season six because I wanted to concentrate on my career,' she revealed. Speaking about her plans for the future, she added: 'I like being freelance because it gives me freedom and I really enjoy brand and creative direction. I'd love my own line, that would be the dream. 'I thought it was so unattainable but I'm so keen.' Goodbye, Chelsea!

"A devoted grandmother died from cervical cancer after her GP repeatedly dismissed her symptoms as the menopause. Cheryl Humpage, 55, died in July 2010 after huge tumours spread - despite her undergoing an aggressive course of chemotherapy. Almost 18 months earlier in February 2008, the grandmother-of-three and former factory worker sought medical help after complaining of nausea, unusual bleeding and fever. Her GP, Dr Martin Crowther, of St Peter's Surgery in Walsall, West Midlands, dismissed her symptoms as the menopause and she was prescribed HRT. Cheryl Humpage saw her GP several times complaining of nausea, unusual bleeding and fever - all well-documented symptoms of cervical cancer.  By the time she was diagnosed, it was too late to save her . February 15, 2008 - Mrs Humpage first visited her GP complaining of fever, vomiting and aching. He gave her painkillers and suggested it was probably the menopause. February 22, 2008 - She returned to the GP as her symptoms had not improved. He offered a course of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) but she did not want it. September 2008 - Mrs Humpage had been experiencing having heavy bleeding so went back to see the GP again. This time he prescribed HRT. February 23, 2009 - After another visit, she was finally referred for a scan at Walsall Manor Hospital. March 5, 2009 - Mrs Humpage underwent an ultrasound which highlighted a large tumour on her ovary. She was admitted to City hospital as an emergency. April 19, 2009 - The primary cancer is found to be on her cervix and she is referred for chemotherapy . July 26, 2010 - Mrs Humpage dies aged 55. But her symptoms persisted and despite being examined by Dr Crowther a further three times, she was not diagnosed with cancer until a year later. In March 2009, doctors finally diagnosed her with cancer after she was referred to a specialist at Walsall Manor Hospital but it was too late to save her and she died four months later. Today her devastated husband Peter, 56, received a five-figure compensation pay-out from the GP's insurers after suing Dr Crowther for medical negligence. Mr Humpage said: 'Cheryl was very concerned about her symptoms but she thought she was in safe hands. 'She was a great mum and grandmother and very family orientated, we're all absolutely heartbroken that she's no longer with us. 'It's very hard not to be angry about what happened. Cheryl should not have had to suffer like she did and if the cancer had been diagnosed earlier we believe we could have had longer with her. 'We just hope that what happened to Cheryl acts as a reminder to all of us about the importance of a quick diagnosis of cervical cancer. 'It is however still difficult to come to terms with out loss because we have never had any sort of apology or admission of responsibility to help us draw a line under everything that happened. 'Until then, I'm not sure that we can ever truly move forward.' Dr Crowther today apologised for failing to detect Mrs Humpage's cancer. He said: 'I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere sympathy to Mrs Humpage's family for their loss. 'I am sorry for the delay in making a diagnosis. I . have reflected extensively on the episode and discussed it with . colleagues and I have learned from this process, now being more aware of . the danger in similar situations.' A year after Mrs Humpage's symptoms appeared she was finally referred to a specialist at Walsall Manor Hospital (pictured), where she was diagnosed with incurable cancer . Lindsay Tomlinson, from Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, who represented the family, said: 'This is a tragic case that has left a family devastated by the loss of a wife, mother and grandmother. 'During out investigations an independent medical expert found that Cheryl's GP should have recognised her symptoms as typical of those experienced by cervical cancer sufferers. 'Any yet no pelvic examination was made, she was not referred to a gynaecologist and no advice was given advising her to return for further medical attention should the bleeding continue. 'Had she been referred earlier she would have avoided such a long period of pain and suffering without a diagnosis and our expert was of the opinion that on balance she would have lived for longer and had more time with her family.' Ms Tomlinson added that if her cancer had been picked up earlier, her suffering would have been 'greatly reduced and it was 'incredibly hard for all her family to see her deteriorate so quickly'. About 2,900 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK and it is most common in sexually active women aged between 25 and 45. The symptoms of aren't always obvious and the disease may not cause any symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage. In most cases, abnormal bleeding is the first sign. Its usually occurs after sex although any usually bleeding should be investigated. Other symptoms include pain in and around the vagina during sex, an unpleasant smelling discharge and pain when passing urine. If the cancer has spread there may be other symptoms including constipation, blood in the urine, loss of bladder control, bone pain, a loss of appetite and a lack of energy. Because of routine screening in the UK it is usually picked up in the precancerous stage. Therefore it is recommended that all women between the ages of 25 and 49 are screened for cervical cancer every three years. Women aged between 50 and 64 are offered screening every five years.","Cheryl Humpage saw her GP several times complaining of nausea, unusual bleeding and fever - all well-documented symptoms of cervical cancer .

"President Obama is prepared to act unilaterally and suspend sanctions on Iran in order to help resolve nuclear talks by a self-imposed November 24 deadline, according to a report. A senior White House official says, while the president lacks the power to lift the sanctions, he can and intends to suspend them in order to help negotiate away Iran's power to build nuclear arms. 'We wouldn't seek congressional legislation in any comprehensive agreement for years,' the official told the New York Times. Feeling the pressure: Obama plans to sidestep Congress and suspend Iran sanctions in his quest to resolve nuclear talks by self-imposed November 24 deadline . Western governments want Iran to cut its uranium enrichment capacity so that it would take a long time to purify enough uranium for an atomic weapon. Tehran, which says all its nuclear work is for peaceful ends, has rejected demands to significantly reduce the number of enrichment centrifuges below the 19,000 it has now installed, of which roughly half are operating. The U.S. official said gaps in negotiating positions must be narrowed in a way that 'ensures that all of the pathways for fissile material for a nuclear weapon are shut down.' Congress may not agree with those pathways, but they've known about the possibility of lifting sanctions since earlier this year when negotiators testified about the necessity to do so, reports the Times. As of last week, it remained unclear just how close Obama and his allies were to meeting their self-imposed deadline. Iran's foreign minister said on Thursday that nuclear talks in Vienna this week were difficult but that progress was made and possible solutions discussed, sources who attended his briefing for Iranian media said. Mohammad Javad Zarif spoke after a meeting on Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton that lasted some six hours in the Austrian capital. 'It was very difficult, serious and intensive ... but instead of focusing on problems, we discussed solutions as well,' he said, the sources told Reuters. 'There was progress in all the fields.' Zarif also said he would next meet with Kerry and Ashton in three-four weeks' time, Iranian state television reported. Ashton coordinates talks with Iran on behalf of six world powers, including the United States.

"Timothy DeFoggi, a former acting director of cyber security for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was convicted Tuesday on federal charges of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, conspiracy to advertise and distribute child pornography, and accessing a computer with intent to view child pornography. A Nebraska jury handed down seven separate guilty verdicts following a four-day trial, in connection with his membership in a child pornography website operated by Aaron McGrath, 31, before his arrest, conviction and sentencing to a 20-year prison term. MailOnline has confirmed through court records that while DeFoggi was a resident of the Washington, D.C. bedroom community of Germantown, Maryland, he used two screen aliases to communicate on the underground child-porn site: 'F***Christ' and 'PT***eater' The name of the website was often redacted from court filings, and MailOnline has opted not to print it. But federal prosecutors mentioned DeFoggi's screen names often in court. Sick: Timothy DeFoggi, a former acting director of cyber security for the U.S. Department of health and Human services, was convicted Tuesday on federal charges of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, conspiracy to advertise and distribute child pornography, and accessing a computer with intent to view child pornography . This chart, from the HHS fiscal 2014 'Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees' related to the 'Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund,' shows that during 2013 Timothy DeFoggi was in charge of operating-system security on all of HHS computers . Kevin Charest (top C), chief information security officer for the Department of Health and Human Services Department, was DeFoggi's boss at HHS . In one court filing, his lawyer conceded that 'In the ""About Me"" section of username ""f***christ's"" profile on ""Website A,"" it says: ""Have many perversions. Contact me for fantasy chat."" The attorney argued, unsuccessfully, that DeFoggi and his co-defendant, Zackary Austin, were engaging in harmless online fantasies. 'According to evidence presented at trial,' the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement Tuesday, 'DeFoggi registered as a website member on March 2, 2012, and maintained his membership and activity until Dec. 8, 2012, when the website was taken down by the FBI.' 'Through the website, DeFoggi accessed child pornography, solicited child pornography from other members, and exchanged private messages with other members where he expressed an interest in the violent rape and murder of children.' 'DeFoggi even suggested meeting one member in person,' the DOJ statement added, 'to fulfill their mutual fantasies to violently rape and murder children.' The grand jury's description of the crimes was so graphic that a judge agreed to order the redaction – the blacking out – of entire pages on the government's publicly accessible computer servers. McGrath, a Nebraska native, ran a trio of child-porn websites through TOR, 'the onion router,' an open network within the Internet that allows users to hide from network surveillance and surf online without leaving digital footprints. The FBI deployed a custom-made software program in a 2012 investigation it dubbed 'Operation Torpedo,' scouring every so-called '.onion' website it could find and determining which of them were related to illegal activity. McGrath operated two of his sites on the network server 'farm' where he worked by day, and operated a third from his home computer. Federal investigators found that he had left his administrator password blank on one of the child pornography sites. They quickly began collecting information that could identify the computers that were accessing it. One of the sites was a child-porn Facebook knockoff frequented by DeFoggi, 56, and another two dozen defendants the government identified. A federal grand jury indicted the former government computer security honcho on March 20, 2013. He faces sentencing in November. Trouble: Sylvia Matthews Burwell, the newly minted HHS secretary, now has a new PR headache to add to her already heaving pile of Obamacare woes . Attorney General Eric Holder helms the Justice Department, which announced DeFoggi's conviction on Tuesday in a four-day trial that involved seven criminal counts, all related to child pornography . DeFoggi's name appears on an HHS organizational chart in a planning document related to the agency's fiscal year 2014 budget request. The document describes him as being in charge of 'OS IT Security Operations,' reporting directly to HHS Chief Information Security Officer Kevin Charest. HHS did not immediately respond to questions about when he left his job, and whether he was on the government's payroll while his charges were pending. Other defendants snared by Operation Torpedo are named in court documents as Kirk Cottom, Vincent Diberardino, Jason Flanary, Michael Huyck, Brandon Moore, David William Peer, Russell Glenn Pierce, Kevin Pitman, Gary Reibert, John Sebes, Thomas Spencer and Joshua Welch. The FBI said Tuesday that DeFoggi was the sixth to be successfully prosecuted. When he ordered DeFoggi held without bail in May 2013, U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas D. Thalken noted that he appeared 'to have a mental condition which may affect whether the defendant will appear' if he were given bond. It's not clear what that condition is, or whether it will have an impact on sentencing. John S. Berry Jr. and Justin B. Kalemkiarian, his two current attorneys in Lincoln, Nebraska, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Timothy DeFoggi was found guilty Tuesday on all seven child-porn criminal charges he faced in federal court .

"A mysterious 900-year-old crypt covered floor to ceiling in ‘magical’ inscriptions has been uncovered in Sudan.

One of the mummies is thought to be that of Archbishop Georgios, an extremely powerful religious leader in the ancient Makuria kingdom. The 900-year-old crypt (entranceway shown) uncovered in Old Dongola in modern-day Sudan contains seven mummified bodies and walls covered with inscriptions written in Greek and Sahidic Coptic . The inscriptions on the walls of the crypt were written with black ink on a layer of whitewash and have been identified as Greek and Sahidic Coptic. Excerpts from the gospels of Luke, John, Mark and Matthew, as well as magical names and signs, were found on the walls. A prayer given by the Virgin Mary, at the end of which death appears to her ‘in the form of a rooster’ was also uncovered. The crypt was excavated in a monastery at Old Dongola, the capital of a lost medieval kingdom that flourished in the Nile Valley . Old Dongola was first the capital of Makuria and subsequently that of Makuria-Nobatia. At the time the crypt was created, Makuria was at its height. Its kings, ruling from Old Dongola, controlled territory throughout much of modern-day Sudan and parts of southern Egypt. The kingdom was prosperous between 750 and 1150. However, increased hostility from Egypt, and internal discord led to the state's collapse in the 14th century. One of the mummies is thought to be that of Archbishop Georgios, an extremely powerful religious leader in the ancient Makuria kingdom. Researchers believe the inscriptions served as protection for the deceased against evil powers. They were ‘intended to safeguard not only the tomb, but primarily those who were buried inside of it during the dangerous liminal period between the moment of dying and their appearance before the throne of God,’ wrote Adam Lajtar of the University of Warsaw, in the journal Polish Archaeology in the Mediterranean. According to the researchers, Archbishop Georgios’ epitaph was found nearby, stating that he died in A.D. 1113 at the age of 82. They believe one of the mummified bodies within the crypt is of the religious leader. The other mummies within the crypt were of men all over 40 years of age, said anthropologist Robert Mahler. They were all dressed very simply in linen clothing and the crypt was likely sealed after the last of the burials took place. At the time the crypt was created, Makuria was at its height. Its kings, ruling from Old Dongola, controlled territory throughout much of modern-day Sudan and parts of southern Egypt. Pictured is the cemetery of the abandoned village of Old Dongola . ‘The entrance to the chamber was closed with red bricks bonded in mud mortar,’ Professor Godlewski, the current director of the Polish Mission to Dongola, said.

Research to understand the inscriptions are ongoing and a complete record of the texts is to be revealed in the near future.","Inscriptions include religious texts, magical names and mysterious signs .

"Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe has been greeted with a 21-gun salute during a state tour of China. Mr Mugabe, 90, is in China with his wife Grace to ask for help to prop up his country’s ailing economy. Officials say he seeking funds to help rebuild decaying roads, rail and power facilities as well as faciities to help their agriculture industry. His visit comes as central bank figures today revealed foreign investment into Zimbabwe plunged 59 per cent to $67million in the first half of this year. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe was given a 21-gun salute during a visit with China's President Xi Jinping . Mr Mugabe received the formal welcome outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing before beginning talks with the Chinese president . Mr Xi called Mr Mugabe a 'renowned leader of the African national liberation movement' and 'an old friend of the Chinese people' during the visit . Mr Mugabe was met with a 21-gun salute outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing before being ushered in to meet Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. Mr Xi called Mr Mugabe a 'renowned leader of the African national liberation movement' and 'an old friend of the Chinese people whom we respect very much'. He said: 'The traditional friendship between China and Zimbabwe was forged in the glorious years when we stood shoulder to shoulder against imperialism, colonialism and hegemony.' The leaders oversaw the signing of a number of agreements, including on economic, trade and tourism cooperation and emergency food donations and concessional loans from China to the southern African nation. No details were immediately released. Mr Mugabe looks on as his Chinese counterpart Mr Xi claps during the signing ceremony . Mr Mugabe has increasingly leaned on China for financial support after being shunned by Western trade and financial partners following his re-election in 2013 . China invested more than £360million in Zimbabwe in 2013 and has granted more than £600million in loans. Mr Mugabe told Mr Xi that Zimbabwe, being the smaller country, benefited more from the relationship, but said his government would do its best to 'reciprocate your friendship'. Zimbabwe, a once-prosperous nation of 13 million people, has struggled since Mr Mugabe defeated rival Morgan Tsvangirai in a 2013 vote marked by allegations of irregularities. And he has increasingly leaned on China after being shunned by Western trade and financial partners. His victory ended an uneasy power-sharing deal, but foreign investors have been deterred by concerns about corruption and government policies to force foreign-owned and white-owned businesses to cede 51 per cent of their shares to black Zimbabweans. Hundreds of manufacturing companies have closed in the past year. The leaders oversaw the signing of a number of agreements, including on economic, trade and tourism cooperation and emergency food donations and concessional loans . A guard of honor forms before a welcome ceremony for Mr Mugabe;  China invested more than £360million in Zimbabwe in 2013 and has granted more than £600million in loans . Announcing the drop in foreign direct investment in Zimbabwe, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor John Mangudya said exports, mostly minerals and tobacco, were also down 13 per cent in the first half of the year, to $1.3billion, compared with the first six months of 2013. Mr Mangudya said: 'There is therefore need for the country to create an investor-friendly environment so as to tap into these external capital resources to boost employment, production and exports.' Zimbabwe's economy is experiencing a serious dollar crunch and electricity shortages. Several companies have failed to pay salaries or have closed altogether, in a country where only 500,000 hold formal jobs. The economy did return to growth in 2009, after nearly a decade of recession, when Mr Mugabe was forced to share power with his opposition rivals. The government has cut its growth target for this year to 3.1 per cent from 6.1 per cent previously. Mr Mangudya said the tough economic conditions had strained the capacity of companies and individuals to repay loans. The percentage of non-performing loans out of total loans had risen to 18.5 per cent from 17 per cent at the start of the year. Banks in turn have tightened their lending to customers.","Robert Mugabe was called an 'old friend of the Chinese people' during visit .

"Ryanair has been named one of the worst brands in the world by customers, second only to insurance company AXA. Despite recent efforts to transform its reputation, the budget airline was one of the worst-performing brands overall in Siegel+Gale's 2014 simplicity index. In a survey of over 12,000 customers in eight countries, Ryanair was named the second worst-ranked brand, based on ease of customer use of a company's products, services, interactions and communications. Scroll down for video . Worst brands: Ryanair has been named the second worst global brand for simplicity of use in a new survey . Primary customer complaints against the airline were Ryanair's badly designed website and poor customer service that 'leaves the onus on the customer.' The airline's app was also named a major cause for headaches, with many having difficulty in downloading mobile boarding passes. 'The pricing is far too complicated and isn’t put forward honestly,' one respondent said of the airline. 'There’s so many variations and hidden charges on flights and options, it’s hardly worth the hassle,' said another. Other customer criticised that the airline is 'too strict and inflexible on luggage allowances,' and another notes that 'what appear to be amazing offers turn out to be a lot worse off on closer inspection.' Disgruntled: Those surveyed named poor customer service and badly designed website as main grievances . Turnaround: CEO Michael O'Leary told MailOnline that the airline should have been 'nicer to customers earlier' In the UK, 1,700 survey respondents ranked the airline 114th, up ten places in the index from last year. Ryanair placed above brands including AXA, Blackberry, BUPA and E.ON for simplicity. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary hit back at the survey results this week, telling MailOnline Travel that the airline's rising passenger traffic and profits indicate otherwise. He said: ‘If we’re the worst performing brand in the world why are we the biggest international airline in the world? Why are we the most profitable airline?’ ‘These people always seem to (when they want some cheap publicity) they slag off Ryanair.’ Shaking things up: Airbnb has been ranked one of the top 'disruptors' to traditional brands in the travel sector . ‘We have rising load factors, rising traffic, rising growth and rising profits, meanwhile some bunch of nobodies does a reputational survey that says for some reason we’re unsuccessful. 'The proof is what consumers do, not what some silly study says. I have 87 million people this year who say that survey is wrong.’ Liana Dinghile, Group Strategy Director EMEA at Siegel+Gale said: 'Despite Ryanair’s investment over the past 12 months in simplifying its website, mobile app and customer service to correspond with its ""Low fares. Made simple"" strapline, it seems that the company is ultimately still falling short of its promise. 'Respondents in our study found Ryanair’s booking system in particular ""complex"" and ""confusing,"" and 38 per cent said they would be willing to pay more for simpler experiences. Tech toys: Popular with travellers, GoPro is also considered hot competition for traditional photography brands . 'People crave simplicity, and Michael O’Leary would be wise to keep this in mind as he continues to address the repositioning of the company this year. Particularly as Easyjet has climbed 32 places in the same time frame!' In the global industry ranking for simplicity of use, the travel sector did not fare well. Hotels ranked the highest in 11th place overall, while booking agents and air travel brands placed 13th and 15th overall, respectively. Train travel and car travel brands fared worse, placing 22nd and 23rd place out of 25 industries. Car service company Uber, photography brand GoPro, and lodging rental site Airbnb were all named among the top 'disruptors' to traditional travel sector brands in 2014.","Siegel+Gale surveyed more than 12,000 customers in eight countries .

"She's famous for her glossy chestnut locks but it seems that pregnancy has been taking its toll on the Duchess of Cambridge's beauty regime. Touring the West Midlands with her hair in an elegant half-up hairstyle, a glimpse of grey could be seen peeping from beneath the knot holding it in place. Of course, this is not the first time the 33-year-old royal has been snapped showing off a silver streak, with the most recent sighting coming early in January during a shopping trip. Scroll down for video . Glimpse of grey: The Duchess of Cambridge showed off a streak of silver during her trip to the West Midlands . Part of the reason for the spate of recent silver sightings is her second pregnancy: the Duchess has reportedly given up many of her beauty treats in a bid to avoid harming her baby. Hair dye is one such beauty essential often given a wide berth by mothers-to-be, although celebrity hairstylist Jo Hansford says going without isn't always required. 'Although colouring your hair doesn't affect pregnancy and there is no need to avoid it, some people do worry about the consequences,' she explained in an interview with MailOnline. 'Nevertheless, if someone is concerned, there are different techniques that can be used to avoid touching the scalp. 'For example, if they have an all over tint, they could revert to highlights. Alternatively, they could use a colour gloss that would add more depth and tone to the hair as well as enhancing the shine and condition.'

The Duchess of Cambridge is paying a visit to the Emma Bridgewater factory in Stoke-on-Trent today to inspect some charity pottery. And as expected, she looked as pretty as the prints on the plates! She always dresses for the occasion (remember her boat print dress for her Portsmouth visit last week? Perfect!), and today she showed off her baby bump in a print dress from Seraphine with a blue coat by MaxMara. Blue for a boy, perhaps...? It’s been a busy few weeks for Kate, and we’ve had plenty of opportunities to see what’s in her maternity wardrobe the second time around. Of course, Seraphine has featured highly, as well as some old favourites like L.K. Bennett. But when it comes to coats, MaxMara is a must! No doubt the Duchess managed to fit in a spot of shopping whilst at the factory, and it's a good excuse for us to follow suit.

Not that Hansford is giving expectant mothers a license to go mad in the salon: 'We would always recommend seeking advice from a specialist before booking an appointment,' she warns. Official NHS advice agrees, with the health service website explaining that the chemicals involved 'are not highly toxic' and concluding that it is safe to dye your hair while pregnant. 'Most research, although limited, shows that it’s safe to colour your hair while pregnant,' the advice continues. 'Some studies have found that very high doses of the chemicals in hair dyes may cause harm. 'However, these doses are massive compared to the very low amount of chemicals a woman is exposed to when colouring her hair.' Celebrity hair stylist Errol Douglas adds: 'I recommend vegetable dye and colour glosses to my clients when they're expecting. 'They're safe and take them through those months with a gentle solution to keeping roots at bay.' Not the first time: The Duchess was pictured with grey hair while out shopping in early January . Horrified: The Duchess was reportedly less than impressed with these 2013 photos that showed some greys . Increasingly common: The Duchess began noticing greys while preparing for her first pregnancy (right) The Duchess herself is no stranger to hair dye and reportedly booked an emergency appointment with colourist Rossano Ferretti after unflattering photos of her greys were published in November 2013. According to witnesses, Kate left his salon 'looking amazing' and her locks appearing 'big and glossy' after a £600 six-hour session with the Italian stylist. But like many 30-something women, greys have become an increasingly regular occurrence for Kate, with friends saying the Duchess first noticed hers in the run-up to her first pregnancy. To combat these, she had organic vegetable-based dye and subtle low-lights applied during regular four-hour visits to the Richard Ward Hair and Metrospa in Chelsea. But, like the rest of us, she can't prevent further greying as she ages. Not, say stylists, that going silver is always a bad thing. 'Going grey marks nature’s way of softening the hair colour giving natural highlights as the skin pigmentation changes,' says celebrity stylist Daniel Galvin Jr. 'I always recommend using a semi-permanent colour with no ammonia or peroxide, to blend the grey hair and tone it down slightly.' Chemical-free: Kate has reportedly given up anything that involves chemicals during pregnancy .

"Archaeologists are hopeful that an ancient mound in northern Greece could hold the untouched remains of an important senior official from the time of Alexander the Great. Excavations at the ‘incredibly important’ tomb have revealed a pair of sphinxes guarding the grave's entrance. The two sculptures were found under an arch at the Kasta Tumulus site near ancient Amphipolis in Macedonia, Greece. At 1,935ft (590m) wide, it is the largest burial of its kind ever discovered in Greece. Scroll down for video . Archaeologists were hopeful that an ancient mound in northern Greece could hold the remains of a senior official from the time of Alexander the Great. They discovered that its entrance is guarded by a pair of sphinxes (pictured) but last month warned that signs of forced entry indicate it was plundered in antiquity . Greece’s Culture Ministry said that most of the earth around the mythical creatures has now been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes. Chief archaeologist Katerina Peristeri, believes that the monument being uncovered is a unique tomb, not just for Greece but for the entire Balkanic peninsula, and described it as being of ‘global interest’. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, who visited the tightly-guarded site two weeks ago, said the discovery ‘is clearly extremely important’ and dates between 325 and 300 B.C. Alexander, who started from the northern Greek region of Macedonia to build an empire stretching as far as India, died in 323 B.C. and was buried in Egypt. Archaeologists . excavating an ancient mound in northern Greece (picutred) have . uncovered what appears to be the entrance to an important tomb. It is . believed to have been built at the end of the reign of warrior-king . Alexander the Great and Prime Minister Antonis Samaras described the . discovery as 'extremely important’ Alexander (statue pictured) was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC, and died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC . Alexander III of Macedon was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC. He died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC. Alexander led an army across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt claiming the land as he went. His greatest victory was at the Battle of Gaugamela, now northern Iraq, in 331 BC, and during his trek across these Persian territories, he was said to never have suffered a defeat. This led him to be known as Alexander the Great. Following this battle in Gaugamela, Alexander led his army a further 11,000 miles (17,700km), founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents. This covered from Greece in the west, to Egypt in the south, Danube in the north, and Indian Punjab to the East. Alexander was buried in Egypt. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, far to the west. The lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, to the west, where the lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. But archaeologists believe the Amphipolis grave, which is surrounded by a surprisingly long and well-built wall with courses of marble decorations, may have belonged to a senior ancient official. Dr Peristeri has argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone lion that was unearthed a century ago, and is now situated around 3 miles (5km) from the excavation site. Geophysical teams have identified there are three main rooms within the huge circular structure, news.com.au reported. In the past, the lion has been associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, one of Alexander's military commanders who became governor of Syria after the king's death. Greece's culture ministry said that earth around the sphinx statues has been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes (pictured) but hopes of finding further treasures now seem to be slim . The tomb is situated in Amphipolis region of Serres in Greece (marked). Archaeologists believe the grave may have belonged to a senior ancient official. While it looks largely undisturbed, there are fears that looting took place hundreds of years ago . In Greek tradition, the mythical sphinx has the haunches of a lion, sometimes with the wings of a great bird, and the face of a human - usually a woman. It was described by writers as being treacherous and merciless. In many myths, including Oedipus, those who could not answer a riddle posed by the monster, would be killed and eaten. The sphinx described by the Ancient Egyptians was usually male and more benevolent. In both cultures, they often guarded entrances to temples and important tombs. The oldest sphinx found guarding a site was discovered in Turkey and dates to 9,500 BC. ‘The excavation will answer the crucial question of who was buried inside,’ Mr Samaras said. Last week The Culture Ministry called for ‘understanding’ while the Amphipolis excavation proceeds. The discovery has sparked global interest and wild speculation that it may contain rich treasures or the bones of an ancient celebrity. The doorway of the tomb is covered in earth, with traces of painted plaster decoration. ‘It's astonishing, the biggest tomb we have found in Greece so far,’ said archaeologist Chryssoula Paliadelli, an expert on the period who is not involved in the excavation. ‘It clearly shows the wealth that allowed construction of what was, at the time, a hugely costly monument.’ While the tomb appears to be undisturbed, there are fears that it could have been looted hundreds of years ago. Part of a stone wall that blocked off the subterranean entrance is missing, while the sphinxes, which were originally six feet (2metres) high, lack heads and wings. Near the sphinxes, excavators have found fragments of a large marble lion that originally capped the mound, which they say indicates the site was severely damaged and dug up in later antiquity. The excavation is expected to last at least another few weeks. Excavator Katerina Peristeri has argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone lion that was unearthed a century ago, and is now situated around 3 miles (5km) from the excavation site (pictured). The lion has been associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, who was one of Alexander's military commanders .","The tomb is situated in Amphipolis region of Serres in Greece .

"The Queen and Prince Philip were greeted by excited workmen today as they arrived at King's Cross station to take a train to Sandringham for their annual Christmas stay. Their well-wishers - a group of construction workers - snapped away with their camera phones as the couple stepped out of their car. In keeping with tradition, the Royal couple then boarded a train to King's Lynn station in Norfolk on a 90-minute journey to the private estate where they will enjoy the festivities surrounded by family. Queen Elizabeth, left, and the Duke of Edinburgh, right, arrive at King's Cross train station today to take a train to King's Lynn for their annual Christmas break at Sandringham . Say cheese! Builders currently working on the re-development of King's Cross station take out their camera phones to take a snap of the Queen on her journey . From the station it is a 30-minute journey to Sandringham - just enough time to dip into a novel. And hence why, perhaps, The Duke of Edinburgh, 91, was carrying a . copy of the book 'The End Of Empire, Atilla The Hun and The Fall Of . Rome', by Christopher Kelly. And the Queen was spotted doing her paperwork as she travelled by the public train. The Duke Of Edinburgh departs carrying a copy of the book 'The End Of Empire , Atilla The Hun and The Fall Of Rome' by Christopher Kelly . She surprised other passengers by travelling first class on the 10.45am First Capital Connect service from the station. They discreetly . joined more than 50 other unsuspecting people on the train. The scheduled service, which had no buffet car or refreshments trolley, went via . Cambridge and arrived six minutes late at 12.26pm in King's Lynn, . Norfolk. The Queen was seen getting into the festive spirit as she sat in front of an open briefcase, reading a white card with the word 'Celebrating' on the front - possibly the menu for the Royal family's Christmas Day dinner. When she arrived at King's Lynn she was then driven to the estate, where she will soon be joined by her close family for Christmas. The Queen who was wearing a red and . white patterned coat adjusted her trademark headscarf to protect her . form the wind and rain as she walked along the platform. She was also holding a bunch of flowers. The train is a far cry from the luxury the Queen is used to on the royal train. That comes complete with sleeping car, bathroom and a thickly-carpeted saloon and has as many as nine private carriages. But due to the huge running costs the train is now only used on very special occasions. Leaving the train she was followed by four aides carrying bags and the Duke of Edinburgh with his Attila the Hun book in his hand. The . couple then went through a side gate into a car park where a Range . Rover was waiting to drive them seven miles to the 20,000-acre . Sandringham estate. Buckingham Palace is thought to have booked all . dozen seats in the rear first class compartment of the train to ensure . that the pair could sit undisturbed with their staff. One way first . class tickets on the train cost £50 each for the 100 mile . journey, although it would have been £33 if the Queen had used a . senior railcard. Security at the station was stepped up for the Queen's arrival. Wrapped up warm and clutching her black handbag, Queen Elizabeth looks happy as she is set to depart London for the Christmas holiday . Protection Officers carry the couple's briefcases & blankets as the pair walk to the train for their holiday . One passenger said: 'It is . amazing to think that we shared a train with the Queen. I had no idea . that she and Philip were on board until the train stopped.' A First Capital Connect spokesman said he was unable to comment on the Royal couple being on the train. In previous years, the train company insisted that it never gave the Queen any special treatment. The . Queen and Prince Philip will be joined by other members of the Royal . family later in the week and will make a public appearance when they . attend church on Christmas Day. But Sandringham is expected to be . quieter this year without the presence of Prince Harry who is on active . service in Afghanistan. It was originally thought that Kate . and William would not be attending Sandringham this Christmas and will . instead spend it at the Middleton's house but their plans are not yet . clear. The Queen and Prince Philip will stay on the estate until the end of January. Last year Kate spent her first Christmas at the Victorian house, surrounded by another 28 royals. Every year there is a festive ritual that is always adhered to by family and visitors. The Queen's Christmas message is to be screened in 3D and HD for the first time, it was announced today. The traditional broadcast will go hi-tech to allow viewers to scrutinise the Queen as never before in her Diamond Jubilee year. However, viewers will also be able to see the 86-year-old monarch in normal definition during the speech, which will be broadcast at 3pm on Christmas Day. The theme of this year's message is not known but it is likely to feature the key highlights from 2012 - the London Olympic Games and the Diamond Jubilee. The Queen has watched her 3D Christmas message, produced this year by Sky News, and enjoyed the experience. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said the monarch thought the broadcast was 'absolutely lovely'. She added: 'We wanted to do something a bit different and special in this Jubilee year, so doing it for the first time in 3D seemed a good thing, technology wise, to do. 'The Queen absolutely agreed straight away there was no need for convincing at all, she was absolutely ready to embrace something new in this year.' First, guests are told what time they should arrive at Sandringham - usually on December 23rd. It is most junior royals first, most senior last — and are expected to be prompt. By early afternoon, however, everyone is expected to be in attendance. They will be ushered to their rooms, furnished in the post-war spartan style the Queen and her consort still fondly cling to — two-bar electric fires and blankets (no duvets). At 4pm, all having changed into suitable outfits for tea, the family gathers in the White Drawing Room, where the Queen encourages the young royals to help put the finishing touches to the Christmas tree — a Norfolk spruce taken from the 1,000-acre estate. Over home-baked scones and Earl Grey tea, the Master of the Household usually gives each member a timetable and room-plan so they know where to marshal themselves and when over the weekend. Trestle tables are laid out in the nearby Red Drawing Room, with sections marked off with tape showing where each family member’s gifts should be placed — and, again, naturally laid out in order of precedence. Presents exchanged, they will all move through to the hall for drinks — martinis mixed by a servant are popular. Then it’s back to their rooms, for baths and a second change of clothes. For dinner, the men are usually dressed in black tie, the women in evening gowns and jewels. After a gong at 8pm for pre-dinner drinks, the family will sit down to a candlelit, three-course dinner at 8.15pm. The Queen, pictured arriving at the station, will take a 30-minute journey from Norfolk to the private estate . Afterwards, at around 10pm, the women move to another room for coffee, while the men are offered liquers. The Queen normally doesn’t go to bed until midnight, and no one may leave the party until Her Majesty retires.Christmas Day starts with a full English breakfast, before the annual outing to Sandringham parish church at 11am. Her Majesty the Queen and Prince Philip get off the train at 12.26 at Kings Lynn station this afternoon . The public train the Royal couple have decided to travel on today first class . The Queen clutches a bunch of flowers and is wrapped up warm in a head scarf as she gets off the train . On their way, with the Queen taking the lead, the couple walk across the platform before taking a 30-minute journey to their private estate . Back at the big house, preparations will be under way for the traditional Christmas lunch — Norfolk turkey, accompanied by a selection of cold meats and an array of side dishes on silver salvers. The Queen is in charge of the seating plan. Unseen by guests, however, lunch at Sandringham is a drawn-out affair — with junior staff eating at 11am, senior staff an hour later, the royals at 1.15pm and the junior kitchen staff at 2.15pm. Then everything comes to a halt so all can watch the Queen’s speech on TV at 3pm. That afternoon, the royals may go for a walk with the dogs, perhaps play charades or watch TV. The book by Christopher Kelly that the Duke of Edinburgh was carrying is pictured . Prince Philip kept himself amused on the . train journey with the Queen today - by reading a book . about savage barbarian Attila The Hun. The 91-year-old was seen . clutching his unusal choice of holiday reading as he and the Queen . caught a train to start their Christmas and New Year break at . Sandringham. The hardback book by Christopher Kelly entitled 'The End . of Empire, Attila The Hun And The Fall Of Rome' was first published in . 2010 tells how the savage warrior king ravaged Rome in the 5th century. It . is described on website Amazon as being 'an original exploration of the . clash between empire and barbarity in the ancient world, full of . contemporary resonance. Its author Mr Kelly, is a professor of ancient history and a Fellow of Corpus Christi College at the University of Cambridge, where he received his PhD in classics. He lives in Cambridge, England, and also Chicago, Illinois. The book, The End of Attila the Hun and the Fall of Rome, is about the leader of the Huns, Attila. The Romans perceived him as a savage barbarian brutally inflicting terror on whoever crossed his path. Following Attila and the Huns from the steppes of Kazakhstan to the court of Constantinople, Christopher Kelly portrays Attila in a new light. He uncovers an unlikely marriage proposal, a long-standing relationship with a treacherous Roman general, and a thwarted assassination plot. Attila is shown as both a master warrior and an astute strategist whose rule was threatening but whose sudden loss of power was even more so.

"A Girl Scout is in high demand after she started selling cookies outside a medical marijuana clinic. Thirteen-year-old Danielle Lei was certainly ‘thinking outside the box’ when she set up her cookie stall outside The Green Cross marijuana dispensary in San Francisco. Entrepreneurial Miss Lei sold 117 boxes of Tagalongs and Thin Mints in two hours, the proceeds of which benefits charitable organisations. Munchies: Entrepreneurial Girl Scout Danielle Lei set up a cookie stall with her mother outside The Green Cross marijuana dispensary in San Francisco . Miss Lei’s mother Carol said her daughter sold dozens more boxes outside The Green Cross than at other locations – and sold out of Dulce de Leches. Both Danielle and her older sister Nikki have been selling cookies outside medical marijuana clinics before, and their parents see it as a way to learn about the difference between using the drug as a medicine compared to recreation, Mrs Lei told Mashable. ‘You put it in terms that they may understand,’ she said. ‘I'm not condoning it, I'm not saying go out in the streets and take marijuana.’ The Green Cross was more than supportive of Miss Lei’s initiative, and staff bought several boxes for themselves, Mashable reported. Miss Lei’s business idea was equally approved by Girl Scouts of Northern California, who said it is down to the parents where children sell the cookies. In 'high' demand: Miss Lei sold 117 cookie boxes in two hours standing outside The Green Cross . ‘The mom decided this was a place she was comfortable with her daughter being at,’ Dana Allen, director of marketing and communications for Girl Scouts of Northern California, told Mashable. ‘We're not telling people where they can and can't go if it's a legitimate business.’ Not all Girl Scout organisations are as open as California, despite recreational marijuana being legal in both Washington and Colorado. Girls Scouts of Colorado recently denounced a photo of three girls selling cookies outside a marijuana clinic as a photoshop hoax. ‘If you are wondering, we don't allow our Girl Scouts to sell cookies in front of marijuana shops or liquor stores/bars,’ Girls Scouts of Colorado tweeted. In contrast, The Green Cross has invited Miss Lei and her mother to come back, and the charity sales will continue tomorrow, Saturday 22nd February, Mashable reported.","Danielle Lei, 13, sold cookies outside marijuana dispensary .

"A 23-year-old man forgot he was a criminal after hitting his head in a car crash - and has now turned his life around, his lawyer has claimed. Christian Eshenbaugh stole around 2,000 aluminum tire rims, worth more than $33,000, from a salvage yard in Pittsburgh, western Pennsylvania, over a two-month period in 2013. But later that year, he suffered traumatic brain injuries when the car he was traveling in smashed into a tree on Warrandale Road, killing the driver. He spent months undergoing rehabilitation.

In a Butler County court on Wednesday, Eshenbaugh's attorney, Stephen Misko, claimed his client has become a 'completely different person' as he struggles to regain his memory and motor skills. He said the criminal could not recall his offense, has 'turned his life 180 degrees' and no longer has a penchant for petty crimes fueled by drug use, according to the Butler Eagle. Eshenbaugh was sentenced to probation after pleading guilty to stealing a total of 2,057 tire rims, around 20 to 30 at a time, from Marshall's Junk Yard on Browns Hill Road in June 2013. During the car crash, which occurred just months after the theft, Eshenbaugh was a passenger in a vehicle. He suffered a huge blow to the head, causing serious injuries, when the car hit a tree.

Before the crash, Eshenbaugh had carried out a number of petty crimes related to drug use, the court heard. He was charged with disorderly conduct in the tire theft case. In addition to a year's probation, the criminal was ordered to pay a sum of restitution.

"NATO's planned £850 million headquarters could be scrapped as the consortium building it in a posh Brussels suburb is hovering on the brink of bankruptcy. The new headquarters - seen by critics as a monument to the ego of outgoing NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen - has run into 'serious financial difficulties' according to the German news magazine Spiegel, which claims to have accessed paperwork relating to the complex. The magazine claims BAM Alliance's money problems, which it says Rasmussen is aware of but is yet to inform NATO member states about, stems from a simple miscalculation over subcontractor costs and that without an additional £200 million funding, the entire project will grind to a halt. Shambles: NATO's planned £850 million headquarters could be scrapped as the consortium building it in a posh Brussels suburb is hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and needs a £200million cash injection . The new headquarters has run into 'serious financial difficulties' according to German news magazine Spiegel . Spiegel said: 'Rasmussen is aware of the problem but hasn't seen fit yet to inform the public about it, meaning the taxpayers of the 28 NATO member states.' 'At a meeting of NATO's Deputies Committee on December 19, Rasmussen's staff asked that the issue be dealt with 'confidentially,' it added. The building has already more than . doubled in cost and it is unlikely that NATO would want the PR disaster . that would follow if the project was scrapped. The new building is seen by critics as a vanity project by outgoing NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen . German ambassador, Martin Erdmann, . told Berlin in a confidential memorandum: 'We pointed to the disastrous . effect on the image of the alliance if construction were to stop and if . NATO appeared to be incapable of punctually completing a construction . project that was decided at the NATO summit of government leaders in . April 1999 in Washington.' 'The risk of a further cost increase is already palpable,' Erdmann added. The consortium's spokesman told Spiegel: 'Several unforeseen circumstances including significantly increased security requirements by NATO had led to the construction exceeding the initially agreed sum.' He refused comment on the looming bankruptcy. British taxpayers are currently set to pick up around 15 per cent of the bill for the new NATO headquarters with the increased costs almost certain to push that figure up even higher. Any additional fee is bound to be controversial at a time when the Coalition is making unpopular cuts to the country's defence budget. Speaking to the Telegraph, Daniel Hannan, Conservative MEP for South East England, said: 'I'm afraid that, after a while, the primary goal of every international bureaucracy becomes its own expansion and comfort' 'It's true of the UN and FIFA and the EU, and it would be surprising if it weren't also true of NATO' he added.

"Arrested: Ashley Zehnder, 24, allegedly had a months-long relationship with a male student . A high school teacher accused of having sex with a 17-year-old male cheerleader has not committed a crime, her lawyer has said. Biology teacher and cheerleading coach Ashley Zehnder, 24, allegedly had a months-long relationship with the teen, who was a member of the cheerleading squad at Pasadena High School, Texas. The age of consent in Texas is 17. 'We believe she's innocent,' attorney Nicole DeBorde told the Houston Chronicle. 'We don't think any crime has been committed. They're saying [the alleged behavior] is inappropriate solely because of the teacher-student relationship.' Zehnder, who is in a long term relationship, was arrested on Friday on a charge of having an improper relationship with a male student. She is out on $10,000 bond. The student said their relationship, which started in May and lasted throughout the summer, began when he lost his cellphone and used Zehnder's to call it, police said. Afterwards he saved her number to his phone and they began texting and started a relationship, court records said. The relationship reportedly came to light after Zehnder sent the teenager naked photos on Snapchat, which he saved and reportedly showed to other students. 'Secret life': Zehnder, pictured with her  boyfriend, allegedly started the relationship with the student in May . Claims: Zehnder, left with her boyfriend and right, resigned from the school earlier this month after being confronted with naked photos she had allegedly sent the student using Snapchat . Zehnder herself went to school administrators when she learned that a naked photo was being swapped among students, KTRK reported. Officials at Pasadena Independent School District began investigating on October 1 and when staff asked the boy how he got the image, he admitted she had sent it to him through Snapchat. He also admitted to staff that they had been in a sexual relationship since May 2014, KHOU reported. Zehnder initially denied the relationship, but when confronted with the photograph, she admitted that she had sent the naked photo to the teenager through Snapchat. Scene: She taught biology and worked as assistant cheer coach as Pasadena High School in Texas . She resigned from the school on October 9. 'These charges are very serious and this behavior will not be tolerated in Pasadena ISD,' the district said in a statement. 'When an educator violates the trust of a student, it makes it difficult for the majority of teachers who genuinely care for the safety and well-being of students.' According to Zehnder's Facebook page, she is in a long-term relationship. Her next court appearance is scheduled for December 2.","Ashley Zehnder, a biology teacher and assistant cheer coach, 'had a months-long sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student on the cheer squad'

"She was left widowed aged 28 with five young children when her husband was brutally murdered. And Ashlee Birk's grief only worsened when she discovered her spouse had been having an affair. Indeed, Emmett Corrigan had been shot to death by none other his secret lover's vengeful husband. Now, Mrs Birk has spoken of her horrific experience and how she learned to forgive and love again. Scroll down for video . Secret relationship: Ashlee Birk,  was left widowed aged 28 with five children when her then-husband, Emmett Corrigan, was brutally murdered in March 2011. Above, Mrs Birk and Mr Corrigan with four of their children . Affair: Mrs Birk's grief only worsened when she discovered her spouse had been having an affair with his co-worker, Kandi Hall (left). Indeed, Mr Corrigan had been shot to death by Ms Hall's husband, Rob Hall (right) Mrs Birk, who has since remarried, has detailed her inspiring journey from grief to forgiveness and, finally, happiness on a blog, which she began writing last year to give her children 'strength'. On it, she describes how she tried to hide from Mr Corrigan's affair for years after his death - but eventually decided to tell her story to help others heal and potentially save another person's life. She writes: 'I have come to find out that not every one who dreams of a simple life will be granted it as such. I am a 'victim' of murder. I am a victim of infidelity. I am not alone in this sentence. 'I have had the privilege of raising my children and helping five other little 'victims' find faith in a world that left them with none. This is how we found light in a place that went dark all around us. 'I hope that our story and the lessons we have learned can bring peace to at least one other struggling to find answers in their lives, and in turn help us find the peace that we continually seek.' Mrs Birk, who married Mr Corrigan on March 6, 2004, was pregnant with the couple's fifth child, Tytus, when her husband began having an affair with  Kandi Hall, a paralegal at his law firm. Watch the full episode here. Happier times: Mrs Birk, who has since remarried, has detailed her inspiring journey from grief to forgiveness and, finally, happiness on a blog . Above, Mrs Birk with Mr Corrigan and their twin daughters 10 years ago . Father: On it, she describes how she tried to hide from Mr Corrigan's affair for years after his death - but eventually decided to tell her story to help others heal. Above, Mr Corrigan with two of the couple's children . Murder: Mrs Birk did not know about the affair until the early hours of March 12, 2011, when police turned up at her home in Meridian, Idaho, and told her that her spouse had been killed  over the liaison. Above, Mrs Birk posted this photo of the Walgreens store where her husband was murdered on her Facebook page last year . She did not know about the affair until the early hours of March 12, 2011, when police turned up at her home in Meridian, Idaho, and told her that her spouse had been killed over the liaison. The officers explained how Mrs Hall's husband, Rob Hall, had stormed out of his house earlier that night armed with a gun after discovering his wife had been having an affair with Mr Corrigan. Hall then drove to a nearby Walgreens, before fatally shooting Mr Corrigan in the head and heart in the store's parking lot, they told her. Hall was later jailed for 30 years for second-degree murder. At the time of Mr Corrigan's murder, Tytus was just six weeks old. The couple's twin girls Bostyn and Bailey were six, their son Teage was four, and their second youngest, Kaleeya, was only 20 months. In the days, weeks and months after her husband's death, Mrs Birk says she was 'tortured' by the details of the fateful night, during which Mr Corrigan had driven to the Walgreens with Mrs Hall. On her blog, she writes: 'This torture was a slow motion detailed description of not only the horrible choices my husband was making, but the details of how two bullets sunk into his heart and skull. 'Slow motion details of how Rob circled around inside of Walgreens looking for him. Slow motion details of how he waited in that truck for seven minutes for Emmett and Kandi to return. Unaware: Mrs Birk told NBC's Dateline (pictured) that she had no idea her husband was involved with Ms Hall. 'The way [Mr Corrigan] described her was an older woman who he looked up to in a motherly way,' she said . Broken vows: Despite Mrs Birk's suffering in the wake of her husband's murder and infidelity, she says she felt a need to 'forgive'. Above, the couple are pictured together before Mr Corrigan started having an affair . 'Slow motion details of Emmett taking his last breathe (sic). Slow motion details of every emergency person who walked onto the scene, and every detective that investigated that night.' She describes how she experienced all sorts of feelings - from fear of walking into a grocery store and anger at Mr Corrigan's infidelity to a desire to do nothing but 'lie in bed in the fetal position'. She also tried to hide from her husband's betrayal - something she had particularly shocked about considering she was pregnant at the time and Mrs Hall was older than her at nearly 40 years old. Devoted mother: With the help of her religion, Mrs Birk (pictured kissing one of her sons) eventually managed to forgive her adulterous husband . 'The way [Mr Corrigan] described her was an older woman who he looked up to in a motherly way,' she told NBC's Dateline. 'He said, ""She just believes in me"". She was nearly 40 and I was 28.' Speaking to KTVB, she added: 'It's humiliating, who wants to be the wife who wasn't enough, and to admit that you've gone through years of almost hating yourself for something other people did.' And Mrs Birk's emotions only heightened when Hall's murder trial began. 'I remember a day at the murder trial when I had become so numb it felt I was no longer hearing about Emmett,' writes Mrs Birk, who met Mr Corrigan at Utah State University. 'I felt like I was genuinely learning about facts from a movie. The new details to add to my remembrance of the past were like an open flame to the fears that burned in my heart.' But despite Mrs Birk's suffering in the wake of her husband's murder and infidelity, she says she felt a need to 'forgive'. To achieve this incredible challenge, she found herself turning to God. 'I began to see that for me, forgiveness and hope were not an uphill climb - but a mountainous obstacle. And some days I did not win,' she writes on the blog. 'Some moments I hit valleys; others I saw stars. Some moments I could see myself - and others all I could see was defeat. The hard thing about glimmers of hope is the moment when they fade away.' However, with the help of her religion, Mrs Birk eventually managed to forgive her husband  - and has even empathized with other people who may feel the urge to cheat on their partners. A new life: Mrs Birk now lives in Meridan with her new husband, Shawn, who was her first official date after Mr Corrigan's passing. They are joined by her five children and Mr Birk's adopted daughter (all pictured above) 'Just because an unhealthy enticement comes to your mind... that doesn’t make you a bad person. It is what you do with your thoughts that will determine what road you will take,' she says on her blog. Amazingly, she has even written several empathetic letters to Ms Hall - although, these have never been sent - and sought to forgive her husband's killer, who 'must have been hurting too'. Mrs Birk now lives in Meridan with her husband, Shawn, who was her first official date after Mr Corrigan's passing. They are joined by her five children and Mr Birk's adopted daughter. Speaking to Fox News, Mrs Birk, now 32, said of her ongoing blog: 'I've discovered that just like the Savior’s pain brings hope, my own pain can bring hope.' In love: Mrs Birk has also detailed her journey of murder, betrayal and forgiveness in a book, 'Silence Breaks', published last year and available in the local library. Above, she is pictured with Shawn in a Facebook photo . Indeed, the blog has undoubtedly touched many, with nearly five million views to date. In her latest post, last Wednesday, Mrs Birk urges others to see 'the little glimmers of hope' in life. 'Maybe it is an unexpected friend who wipes your tears when a picture of the past flashes in your face and tries to slap you off the track of hope you have been clinging to,' she writes. Mrs Birk has also detailed her journey of murder, betrayal and forgiveness in a book, 'Silence Breaks', published last year. The book is available online only and on-request at the local library.

"Too much: Most Britons will unwittingly take in an astonishing 7000 calories on Christmas day . With less than three weeks to go until Christmas, the countdown is on to ensure gifts, food and drink are ready to go come the big day. But the endless supply of chocolates, snacks, mince pies and festive drinks has a hefty downside, with the average Briton likely to gain 6lbs in the eight days between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Day. Unsurprisingly, the worst day for calorie consumption is Christmas day itself when most us unwittingly consume a shocking 7000 calories - and hit the recommended daily allowance before sitting down to Christmas dinner. According to new research, by 2.08pm, most of us will have consumed our daily calorie allowance (2000 kcals for women, 2500kcals for men). Starting with a 135-calorie celebratory breakfast of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, the gluttonous day usually ends with two mince pies - another 460 calories. But although Christmas lunch has the highest calorie count, the real pitfall is snacking with abundant chocolate, nuts and biscuits heaping on thousands of extra calories. Despite the healthy turkey, a full Christmas lunch with all the trimmings is equivalent to 1,450 calories with pudding, complete with custard and brandy butter, adds another 1,174 on top. Weighty effort: A chart showing how calorie consumption stacks up over the course of Christmas day . And the weighty cost of Christmas lunch hasn't gone unnoticed with one in eight British people admitting to wanting to slim down in advance. The research also found that over a third (35 per cent) said they would like to be 7lbs to 1 stone 7lbs lighter than they currently are. However, it appears that when it comes to shifting the extra pounds gained, yo-yo dieting still reigns supreme, with nearly two thirds (65 per cent) of those that had tried at least one weight loss programme finding that they either did not lose any weight or have piled it all back on since. Calorific: A roast with all the trimmings is equivalent to 1,450 calories while seconds will add another 725 . Alexis Boo, spokesperson at Ideal Weight commented, ‘With the numerous parties and desire to look good in our best outfit, Christmas is a key time for people to think about their weight. 'It’s easy to go overboard during the festive season and eat indulgently with all the temptations on offer, but there’s no reason why you can’t have a bit of what you fancy without worrying about the waistline. 'With some careful preparation in the run up to Christmas, it’s easy to change your eating habits and by paying attention to ourselves through a combination of a wholesome diet and improved levels of exercise, we can set ourselves up for longer term health gains.’","On average, each of us consumes 7,000 calories on Christmas day alone .

"A hiker has been killed by a black bear after it confronted his group of friends - forcing them to scatter in different directions. Police identified the body  as that of  Darsh Patel, who had been hiking with four friends on Sunday when the bear began following them in the 526-acre wooded Apshawa Preserve. The 300-pound animal, which authorities say was likely looking for food, continued to stalk them through the woods, causing them to become frightened and run off in separate directions. When four of them regrouped around 3.45pm, they realized 22-year-old Patel was not with them and they called police. Scroll down for video . Wild: A New Jersey hiker has been killed by a black bear (file photo) after walking through a wooded preserve on Sunday. Officials have suggested that the animal was looking for food when he followed the group . Patel's body was found two hours later. 'Evidence at the scene indicated that the victim had been attacked by a bear,' West Milford Police Chief Timothy C. Storbeck said. Police say that a bear was found circling the body and wouldn't leave even after officers tried to scare it away by making loud noises and throwing sticks and stones. It was killed with two rifle blasts. The bear's body is being examined at a state lab for more clues as to why it may have pursued the group, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection said. Kelcey Burguess, principal biologist and leader of the state Division of Fish and Wildlife's black bear project, said the bear could have been predisposed to attack but more likely was looking for food. Preserve: This photo from NJUrbanForest.com shows the Apshawa Preserve, a 526-acre park with hiking trails . Wildlife officials believe there is a current shortage of the acorns and berries that bears eat. The hikers had granola bars and water with them, Storbeck said. Officials don't believe the hikers provoked the bear but they may have showed their inexperience when they decided to run. The safest way to handle a bear encounter is to move slowly and not look the bear in the eye, DEP spokesman Larry Ragonese said. New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife guidelines direct law enforcement to euthanize 'Category I' bears, which are deemed an 'immediate threat to human safety.' NJ Advance Media reports that the New Jersey State Medical Examiner, the Fish and Wildlife Division of the state Department of Environmental Protection and the West Milford Police Department are looking into the circumstances of Patel's death.

'Bear sightings are not unusual by any stretch in New Jersey,' said Bob Considine, spokesperson for the Department of Environmental Protection. 'They have been seen in all 21 counties, although they’re obviously most common in the northwest part of the state.' Black bears rarely pose a threat to humans and often retreat when confronted.

All national media acceded to the request.But a small number of freelance photographers turned up, including representatives of the Reuters international news agency. The couple’s Scotland Yard police protection officers made no attempt  to stop them taking pictures, as they often do, and even moved their vehicles to provide a clear view of  William and Kate. The photographs subsequently went round the world but St James’s Palace requested British newspapers not to publish them. The only disappointment for the crowds . was the absence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who opted to . spend Christmas Day with Kate’s parents at their new mansion in . Bucklebury, Berkshire, as well as Prince Harry who is serving on the . front line in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot. Instead of meeting and greeting many . of the estimated 3,000 members of the public who go to Sandringham in . Norfolk each year, William and Kate joined her parents, Michael and . Carole Middleton, sister Pippa and brother James for family Eucharist . and Christmas carols at St Mark’s Church in Englefield.

"An aviation technician with extremist Islamic views was charged on Friday after he planned to detonate a car bomb at a Kansas airport. Terry Lee Loewen, 58, was arrested on Friday morning at Mid-Continent regional airport in Wichita, according to U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom, after being thwarted by an undercover FBI investigation. Grissom said Loewen planned to drive a car that he believed was full of explosives into a terminal at the airport and trigger the device in a suicide mission. Scroll down for video . Terry Lee Loewen, 58, was arrested as he tried to plant explosives at Mid-Continent Regional airport in Wichita, Kansas on Friday . Loewen's house where he plotted to plant a suicide bomb at the airport where he worked. The FBI had infiltrated his scheme six months ago . Investigators say Loewen is an avionics technician who lives in Wichita and works at the airport. Grissom said the 58-year-old spent months developing his plan of driving a car filled with explosives into the airport, triggering the bomb and killing himself. He was arrested at 5.30am this morning after he tried to open a gate on to the tarmac at the airport with his security pass. Loewen believed his car was filled with explosives but the FBI confirmed today that the material was never at risk of causing an explosion. The U.S. Attorney said that Loewen was radicalized from reading extremist Islamic texts online. Richard McKown, 81, who lives two doors down from Loewen, told MailOnline today that he was deeply shocked by the crimes that his neighbor had been accused of. He also said that the terror suspect lived with a woman whom he believed to be his wife. A woman called Deborah Loewen is also listed at the same address. Mr McKown, who has lived in the neighborhood for six years, said: 'They kept themselves to themselves. In the summer evenings, all the neighbors would be out talking but they never participated. 'It's a complete shock, no one can understand why.' A Kansas State Trooper, left, and a Wichita Airport Police officer stand watch at the Mid-Continent Airport in Wichita on Friday . A Kansas State Trooper walks outside Mid-Continent Airport where an employee had planned to plant a suicide bomb today . A criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Wichita on Friday charges Loewen with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. He is also accused of attempting to . damage property by explosives and attempting to provide support for a . foreign terror organization. The 58-year-old is due to be arraigned at 3pm (CST). If convicted, Loewen faces life in prison. The FBI said that the suspect had . been under constant surveillance for the past six months and at no . point, had the public faced any danger. FBI Evidence Response Teams are processing several locations. No further arrests are expected. At a press conference on Friday, authorities stressed that there was no indication that the defendant was involved with or working with any religious community in Wichita and that his alleged actions in no way should reflect on any religious group. According . to an affidavit, Loewen had engaged in online chat with an individual . who was actually an undercover FBI agent. He reportedly said that he . wanted to commit 'violent jihad against the United States on behalf . of al Qaeda'. The FBI said that Loewen studied the . layout of the airport, took photographs of access points and . researched flight schedules. He also took part in buying components for a car bomb and talked about how he wanted to set off the device. U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom announces charges against Loewen who was arrested this morning in a case in Wichita, Kansas . According to the affidavit, the undercover agent was told by the suspect on August 5 this year: 'As time goes on I care less and less about what other people think of me or my views on Islam. 'I have been studying subjects like jihad, martyrdom operations and Sharia law.' He later continued: 'I feel so guilt-ridden sometimes for knowing what's required of me but yet doing little or nothing to make it happen.' In a later message to an undercover officer, according to the affidavit, Loewen said: 'Brothers like Osama bin Laden and Anwar Al Awlaki are a great inspiration to me...' The terror suspect later said that he had been studying Al-Awlaki's methods of jihad and 'printed out something called the Al Qaeda manual'. Loewen also told an undercover agent during the online chats of some of the deadly plans he had in mind. He explained his plot in detail, offering a supposed accomplice a tour of the airport and said how he could be the 'access' guy. Terry Lee Loewen, 58, was arrested on Friday morning at Mid-Continent regional airport (pictured) after he tried to plant a bomb on the tarmac . He wrote: 'I'm 58 years old and spending my remaining years behind bars for a good reason is not out of the question for me.' Loewen . sent pictures to the undercover agent of what appeared to be fighter . jet trainers on the tarmac outside of the hanger where he worked at the . airport, according to the affidavit. The . interactions between the suspect and the agent continued to the point . of purchasing material that Loewen believed to be capable of creating a . bomb. According to the affidavit: 'In discussing the specifics of the operation, which included taking a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) to the terminal near a number of passenger planes, Loewen suggested that another individual could come in to the terminal with a suicide vest...' On Wednesday, . the FBI employee made the final preparations on the bomb and Loewen said . that he was 'happy' with the plan which was set for December 13. This morning before 5am, Loewen was picked up by his believed accomplice at a local hotel and taken to a location where they had stored the bomb. Kansas governor Sam Brownback speaks during a press conference announcing the arrest of Terry Lee Loewen after he planned a suicide bomb attack . The suspect finished wiring the device, believing that it would be 'operational', according to the affidavit. They drove to the airport and at a security gate, Loewen tried twice to use his access badge, which was unique to him, to enter the tarmac. However the gate had been disabled by authorities and Loewen was taken into custody. In a suicide letter that Loewen wrote for a family member, he wrote, according to the affidavit: 'By the time you read this I will - if everything went as planned - have been martyred in the path of Allah. He continued: 'The operation was timed to cause maximum carnage + death.' He closed the letter with the words: 'I expect to be called a terrorist (which I am), a psychopath, and a homicidal maniac' U.S. Senator Jerry Moran released the following statement after learning of the arrest: We are grateful for the law enforcement officials who kept individuals, including many Kansans, safe today. 'This incident is a reminder that we must remain vigilant and reaffirm our commitment to protecting this country and its ideals from those who wish to do us harm.'","Terry Lee Loewen, 58, was arrested on Friday morning at Mid-Continent regional airport in Wichita with explosive material .

"Sarah Palin said she would 'baptize' terrorists by waterboarding them at a NRA rally on Saturday. Palin was a speaker at the group's 'Stand and Fight Rally,' held at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The Republican former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee's remarks followed her criticism of of policies she said were coddling to 'enemies that would annihilate America - they who'd obviously have information on plots to say, carry out jihad. 'Oh, but you can't offend them, can't make them uncomfortable, not even a smidgen. Scroll down for video . Criticism: Sarah Palin criticized 'coddling' policies against America's and said if she were in charge she would baptize them through waterboarding . 'Well, if I were in charge, they would know that waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists,' she said. Her remarks were met with loud applause. As pointed out by Raw Story, Palin's remarks on Saturday differ strongly from those of her 2008 running mate Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. 'In my personal experience, the abuse of prisoners sometimes produces good intelligence, but often produces bad intelligence because under torture a person will say anything he thinks his captors want to hear –- whether it is true or false –- if he believes it will relieve his suffering,' McCain said in 2011. Too harsh? Elsewhere in her speech, Palin said that gun-free zones are 'stupid on steroids' Palin also criticized an 'intellectual . elite in a far-distant capital' that she said wanted Americans to . abandon Revolutionary War ideals. She also implied that the government is trying to control the people. 'Look, if you control oil, you control an economy,' she said. 'If you control money, you control commerce. But if you control arms, you control the people and that is what they're trying.' Elsewhere in her speech, she called the idea of gun-free zones as 'stupid on steroids' and dismissed the idea of gun stores being linked to crime. 'Gun stores are an accomplice to crime - and that fork made me fat,' she said.","Palin was speaker at 'Stand and Fight Rally' in Indianapolis .

"A U.S. health authority poster claiming Ebola can be transmitted by droplets through the air has been removed from its website, prompting concerns the deadly virus can be caught through a sneeze. The poster, which caused alarm because it seems to go against medical advice that the virus cannot be transmitted by air, said Ebola could be contracted if someone came into contact with objects that had been sneezed on by people who were infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) poster said droplets, such as those from a sneeze, carried the virus and could remain infectious on surfaces for up to several hours. The CDC image which shows their warning that droplets from a sneeze could transmit Ebola . Debate about government-imposed quarantines for people exposed to the virus has grown over the past few weeks, as isolated cases  are diagnosed in the U.S. and it continues to spread across West Africa. So far, more than 4,900 people have been killed - the vast majority in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - in the deadliest outbreak of the virus on record. The CDC poster, now removed, stated: 'Droplet spread happens when the germs traveling inside droplets that are coughed or sneezed from a sick person enter the eyes, nose or mouth of another person,' the New York Post reported. It warned someone could become infected should they accidentally touch the sneeze droplets and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth. Today, the CDC internet page dedicated to the subject stated it was being updated. It read: 'The What’s the difference between infections spread through air or by droplets? Fact sheet is being updated and is currently unavailable. Please visit cdc.gov/Ebola for up-to-date information on Ebola.' Medical experts have repeatedly stated the Ebola virus is not transmittable by air. It is contracted when someone comes into contact with the body fluids, such as urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk and semen, of a person who is infected. An image of the Ebola virus, which has killed nearly 5,000 people in West Africa and recently reached the U.S. But experts have repeatedly warned of the frightening possibility the Ebola virus could mutate and become airborne. Although the risk of it doing so is thought to be low, experts cannot discount it entirely. Two weeks ago leading scientist Lord Robert Winston warned the risk of Ebola spreading could dramatically increase if it becomes airborne. In a House of Lords debate, the fertility doctor demanded answers from the government about how closely they were monitoring the virus. Lord Winston said: ‘We know that viruses mutate, we know that the Ebola virus can mutate. ‘We know perfectly well that it is not airborne at the moment, and we know that the pharyngeal and upper respiratory tract cells are unlikely to harbour the virus. ‘However, can you assure us that people are looking at the risk of mutation of this virus so that we can make certain that its mode of transmission does not change?' And the chief of the UN’s Ebola mission, Anthony Banbury, also warned earlier this month that the virus could become airborne. He said aid workers were racing against time to control the epidemic in case it mutates in a ‘nightmare scenario’.

"Seldom seen: Eduardo Saverin, pictured at a media event in New York last year, now lives a rarefied life in Singapore . On May 18, Facebook's long-awaited share flotation is expected to go ahead - and few will likely be happier with the news than original investor and co-founder, Eduardo Saverin. Mr Saverin, 30, was friends with Mark Zuckerberg when they attended Harvard in 2004 and originally invested in the social network. The move left Saverin, who comes from a wealthy Brazilian family, with an estimated $2billion fortune, according to Forbes. However despite a substantial boost in their collective fortune from the IPO, Saverin will unlikely celebrate with Zuckerberg and the former friends from his college posse. Saverin began with a one-third stake in the company which was watered down when Zuckerberg began bringing others on board. The founders became embroiled in a bitter legal battle which left Saverin with a 2 per cent stake, according to the Wall Street Journal - and still an incredibly wealthy man. He now lives in Singapore where he has . become notorious for his playboy lifestyle - buying bottles of . champagne at the most exclusive clubs in the company of the super-rich, society crowd . and supermodels. Blogs have sprung up tracking his partying with many locals hoping to get close to the self-made billionaire. He also reportedly drives a Bentley and lives in a penthouse in one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods. Scroll down for video . Playboy lifestyle: Eduardo Saverin (far right) enjoys a rooftop party with friends and models in his new home of Singapore. He may not be allowed to return to America if his move was judged to be down to tax avoidance . According to Asia Tatler, Saverin is a . fan of hanging out at Singapore's only private members club Filter in the . Conrad Hotel. DJs are regularly flown in from around the world and high-end . tables come with ice buckets overflowing of bottles of Belvedere vodka and Moet champagne. Investment: Saverin has invested in a start-up cosmetics company run by Rachel Kum, former Miss Singapore 2009, to whom he also offers his business expertise . The whirlwind . of parties, adoring friends and fast cars seems to have left little time . for business apart from Saverin's investment in Rachel K - a start-up . cosmetics company run by Rachel Kum, former Miss Universe 2009 whom . Saverin also mentors. During a launch for the brand at a rooftop party, Saverin said: 'With a company like Facebook, it's not just three people deciding how the world communicates, it's really about providing a tool so your customers can be themselves.' He added: 'I think it really inspired me to see that she [Rachel Kum] went from Miss Singapore to pushing her line, that she's going with her passion.' He has also ploughed money into information site Qwiki and online payment service Jumio. The Facebook share flotation is expected to happen on Friday, May 18, with Mark Zuckerberg planning to start the 'roadshow' preceding the initial public offering (IPO) on Monday. The social . network, now eight years old, has 900million members and was valued at up to $79.3 billion. It . is one of the most anticipated - and potentially the world's biggest - . stock market entry of an Internet company since Google floated in 2004. Zuckerberg, Saverin and the original start-up Facebook team including Dustin Moskovitz, Sean Parker and Chris Hughes were immortalised in the 2010 film The Social Network. Saverin was played by Andrew Garfield and is portrayed as a slightly naive player in the game. In reality, Saverin's former friend Mark Zuckerberg, who is worth an estimated $17.5 billion and is set to . make another $1 billion from the Facebook flotation, lives a polar opposite lifestyle. The 27-year-old is rarely seen out of a . hoodie and lives a low-key existence with his long-term girlfriend in . Palo Alto, California. He only bought his first property last year. Intertwined: Eduardo Saverin with fan in a Spiderman costume - a role which his film alter-ego Andrew Garfield has also played on screen . High class hang-out: Filter, the only private members club in Singapore at the Conrad Hotel, is said to be one of the Brazilian playboy's favourite night spots . One thing Saverin does prize highly . is his privacy and closely guards details of his life.

"After a chaotic match on Sunday, Chelsea and Manchester United meet again just three days later in Wednesday's Capital One Cup clash at Stamford Bridge. The referee is Lee Mason. Mark Clattenburg has referred to an 'extraordinary incident' in his match report from Sunday's explosive game at Stamford Bridge. The FA are set to review video evidence after launching an investigation into claims referee Clattenburg racially abused Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel during Blues' 3-2 defeat by Manchester United. The specific incident referred to by Clattenburg remains unclear but referees submit them on matters that may require FA intervention. The police could also yet become . involved after the lawyer behind the mooted black players' breakaway . union, Peter Herbert, made a written complaint to the Metropolitan . Police Service (MPS). Chelsea made a complaint to the Premier League after Mikel stormed into the referee’s room to demand an apology after claiming Clattenburg made a racist slur when he booked the midfielder in the 76th minute. One of Chelsea’s Spanish stars is also involved after players claim they heard Clattenburg refer to him as ‘a Spanish t**t’. Spaniards Fernando Torres, Juan Mata and Cesar Azpilicueta all played against United. It has also emerged that Clattenburg has been stood down from this weekend's Premier League action. Scroll down for video . In the spotilight: Mark Clattenburg, leaves his home near Newcastle on Monday . Grabbing a lift: Clattenburg jumped into a car with fellow ref Michael Oliver . The FA and Premier League could ask Sky TV for footage from the 20 camera angles used for the big live matches to help confirm whether Mark Clattenburg made an inappropriate or racially aggravated comment. Premier League refs wear microphones, which means evidence from Michael McDonough and Simon Long — who both ran the line — and fourth official Michael Jones may prove crucial. A statement from the Professional Game Match Officials read: 'We believe that, with any football match, the focus should not be on the officials but on the players and the game itself. 'Mark Clattenburg is one of the elite referees in world football and, in these circumstances, the intense level of scrutiny would detract from the match and be unfair to the clubs and the supporters of both sides.' The FA will now request all footage from Sky Sports from the game. While not all are recorded, they should help confirm whether Clattenburg made an inappropriate or racially aggravated comment. An FA statement read: 'The FA has begun an investigation relating to allegations made following Sunday's fixture at Stamford Bridge between Chelsea and Manchester United. The FA will make no further comment at this time.' Premier League referees also wear . microphones, which suggests evidence by Michael McDonough and Simon Long . — who ran the line — or fourth official Michael Jones could be crucial. However, these discussions are not recorded — meaning it could come down to one man's word against another, like in the John Terry and Anton Ferdinand race row. Accused: Clattenburg is alleged to have racially abused John Obi Mikel (right) during Chelsea's defeat . Dispute: Mikel complains to Clattenburg as his side slump to defeat at Stamford Bridge . Herbert, in making his complaint to the MPS, wrote: 'The Society of Black Lawyers wishes to record the incident that took place at Chelsea FC as a racial incident according to ACPO [Association of Chief Police Officers] guidelines. 'Although this matter may be investigated by the FA it is appropriate that the MPS independently see if a racially-aggravated offence has occurred.' It is understood the police had received the letter on Monday night but it was by no means certain an investigation would follow. Chelsea, United and anti-racism group Kick It Out all refused to comment on the unfolding story on Monday morning. However, . the Blues did confirm they had decided against holding a press . conference on Tuesday to preview Wednesday night's Capital One Cup clash . with United. Lee Mason is the referee for that meeting. Chelsea made the official complaint at 7.45pm on Sunday night, but Clattenburg had already been confronted by then. Chief executive Ron Gourlay, with Mikel and manager Roberto Di Matteo, . demanded an apology during stormy scenes in the referee’s room. Clattenburg refused and Chelsea decided . to take the incredible action of launching an immediate complaint to the . Premier League, via match delegate Nick Cusack, over his language. According to sources close to the players, they are willing to make statements to the FA’s disciplinary committee this week. Marching orders: Referee Mark Clattenburg showed two red cards to Chelsea players on Sunday . Marching orders: Branislav Ivanovic was sent off (above) while Clattenburg struggled to contain both sides . A club spokesman said: ‘We have . lodged a complaint to the Premier League match delegate with regards to . inappropriate language used by the referee and directed at two of our . players in two separate incidents in today’s match. The match delegate . will pass the complaint to the FA.’ Clattenburg . was pictured leaving his home near Newcastle on Monday morning before . getting into a car with fellow official Michael Oliver. The incidents occurred on the day Chelsea threw support behind the Kick Racism Out of Football campaign. Players from Chelsea and United — with the exception of United’s Ashley Young — wore One Game One Community T-shirts in the warm-up. John Terry, serving a four-match ban for . racially insulting Anton Ferdinand last October, wore a Kick It Out . badge as he watched from the sidelines. Rio Ferdinand, fined £45,000 for his ‘choc ice’ tweet, also ended his feud with Ashley Cole when they shook hands before the game. But all that was forgotten amid dramatic scenes nearly two hours after the final whistle. Tough time: Clattenburg was given a hostile reception by the Chelsea fans as he left the field . Home players heard the alleged . comment to Mikel and will back up his story. Clattenburg said he would . co-operate with any inquiry. Professional . Game Match Officials, the body which represents Premier League . referees, released a statement which read: ‘PGMO is aware of the . allegations and they are being treated with the utmost seriousness. Mark . will co-operate fully and welcomes the opportunity for the facts to be . established.’ Prospect, the referees' union, said . in a statement: 'Prospect is committed to helping to eradicate racism in . football and in society generally. In the context of that commitment, . Prospect is offering full support to Mark Clattenburg in relation to the . allegations made against him. 'It . is now important that the allegations are fully investigated through . the proper process as quickly as possible. We will be making no further . comment at this stage.' Winner: Javier Hernandez scores Manchester United's third goal . Meanwhile Gordon Taylor has urged the Football Association to deal with Chelsea's accusations against as quickly and fairly as possible. Taylor, head of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), is wary of the fact that the most recent row concerning racism in football - that involving Blues captain Terry - dragged on for almost a year before he was banned by the FA, and he does not want this case to go on for such a long period of time. 'We've got to learn the lessons of the last 12 months,' Taylor said. 'This is extremely serious for the referee involved so that's why it's important that it is dealt with in the most thorough manner and as quickly, efficiently, and transparently as possible.' Taylor thinks conversations between officials should be recorded to help any cases that come up in the future. 'The PFA have never been against that (recording what is said),' he said. 'That could be an aid for clarity over what exactly has happened in those situations.' VIDEO: Did referee abuse black Chelsea player?

"A secret arsenal of guns and ammunition hidden in the wake of the Dunblane massacre have been found stashed behind a false wall by a builder renovating a house. Builder Simon Berni, 41, was shocked to discover a secret haul of more than 30 shotguns and pistols as well as hundreds of rounds of ammunition when he began working on a south Wales property. He said: 'It was an incredible arsenal - full, absolutely choc-a-bloc with eight shelves of fire arms and ammunition.' Builder Simon Berni, 41, stands next to a fake wall used to hide a huge arsenal of guns and ammunition . The haul: It is believed a previous owner of the property in Dinas Powys, South Wales, stashed these guns behind the wall after the Dunblane massacre in 1996 . Well hidden: The secret compartment was only discovered when Mr Berni started renovating the property . Investigation: Police safety removed the collection of firearms from the property . Police were today investigating the gun stash uncovered in a semi-detached in a quiet village in south Wales. The guns were wrapped in newspaper dated March 1996 - just days after the Dunblane massacre in which 16 children were shot dead. Police believe the guns were . unregistered and their owner hid them out of fear of losing them when . strict new firearms laws were brought in following the Dunblane . shootings. Evidence: Mr Berni, 41, holds up a newspaper dated March 1996 that the guns had been wrapped in . The country was left in horrified shock after Thomas Hamilton, 43, walked into Dunblane Primary School in the small Scottish town and shot sixteen children and one adult dead before committing suicide. Public outcry at the killings in March 1996 and an official enquiry entitled the Cullen Report forced new gun laws to be brought in. Subsequently, the Firearms . (Amendment) Act . 1997 and the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997 were enacted, . effectively making private ownership of handguns illegal in the United . Kingdom. The Dunblane massacre remains one of the deadliest criminal acts involving firearms in the history of the United Kingdom. Mr . Berni was renovating his uncle's house in the quiet village of Dinas . Powys, near Cardiff, when he made the gun haul discovery. He . found one set hidden in the space behind a wall heater and another when . he took down a plasterboard wall to uncover the secret arsenal. The firearms ranged from a pistol from the 1930s to a pump-action shotgun. Around 250 live bullets were also found. He added: 'I was shocked because there weren't any bricks in the wall but a lot of shotgun barrels and hand guns. 'They . obviously belonged to somebody who knew what they were doing as they . were all greased and beautifully wrapped up in newspaper.' Police are working on the theory that the owner of the guns died after concealing them in the house. History: The newspaper found hidden in the wall is dated the day after the Dunblane shootings happened on March 13, 1996 . Kept secret: It is believed the previous owner of the house in Dinas Powys died after hiding the weapons . Following the discovery the police were called to the modern semi-detached home and carried out a search with sniffer dogs. A South Wales Police spokeswoman said: 'Police in Barry are investigating the discovery of up to 30 old firearms at a property under renovation in Dinas Powys. 'The weapons have been removed safely by trained police officers. 'It is believed that they have remained undiscovered for several years having been concealed by a previous owner of the property.' Law change: Private ownership of handguns was banned in 1997 - a year after the Dunblane massacre . Collection: The weapons were all found to be in pristine condition and had all been carefully wrapped up . The killing of sixteen innocent children and their teacher at a primary school in a Scottish village - known as the Dunblane massacre - remains one of Britain's worst mass-shootings. Misfit loner Thomas Hamilton, pictured right, burst into Dunblane Primary School gym and opened fire - killing the pupils and their teacher, Gwen Mayor, on March 13, 1996. The former Scout leader fired at random in the school's gym before turning the gun on himself. The world looked on in horror as details of the bloody massacre in Scotland unfolded. Andy Murray, the British tennis player, was a pupil at the Dunblane school at the time of the shootings. He has described hiding under the table in his classroom during the attack. It prompted outrage from around the world, including from the Queen, pictured below laying flowers at the scene, and then Prime Minister John Major, who called it a 'sick and  evil act'. 'I find it difficult to express the feelings I know will be felt throughout Dunblane,' said the Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth, who represented Dunblane. 'This is a close-knit community where everyone knows everyone else and the impact of this horrible tragedy will be felt in every household.' The subsequent public inquiry revealed that Hamilton had licenses for six guns and had previously been investigated by local police for inappropriate behavior around young boys. Among other transgressions, while serving as a scout leader, Hamilton reportedly took photos of semi-naked boys without their parents' permission. The year after the massacre Tony Blair introduced the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 which banned private ownership of the remaining handguns in England, Scotland and Wales, and left only some historic and sporting handguns legal. Dunblane was one of three major mass-shootings in modern British history, after the tragedy of Hungerford and before a second massacre in the Lake District in Cumbria two years ago. An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to a massacre in the Lake District as taking place at a “school”.  We are happy to accept this was not the case and are sorry for any confusion caused.","Simon Berni made the discovery while renovating a house in south Wales .

"The Home Office gave nearly £500,000 to groups linked to campaigners for sex with children. A Whitehall inquiry found ‘clear evidence’ that £476,250 was granted over a decade to two organisations connected to the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange. The findings were released yesterday as Home Secretary Theresa May announced a major inquiry into how public bodies dealt with historical allegations of child sex abuse. Scroll down for video . A Whitehall inquiry found that £476,250 was granted to organisations connected to the Paedophile Information Exchange. The findings were released as Home Secretary Theresa May (above) announced a major inquiry . As the paedophile scandal continued to engulf Westminster, it also emerged that: . A Daily Mail investigation earlier this year revealed shocking links between PIE, which campaigned for the age of consent to be dramatically lowered, and three senior Labour figures who held key roles in the National Council for Civil Liberties. Former health secretary Patricia Hewitt was forced to apologise for her dealings with PIE, although Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and her husband, home affairs spokesman Jack Dromey, strongly denied giving any support to the pro-paedophile group. Last December a former employee accused the Home Office of giving tens of thousands of pounds to PIE through its Voluntary Services Unit, which provided annual grants for charities. Civil servants launched a trawl through 35,000 documents to investigate the claims, focusing on the VSU’s activities between 1973 and 1985. Their findings were finally published yesterday, prompting concerns that it had been timed so it would be overshadowed by Mrs May’s announcement of an over-arching inquiry. It found that two groups associated with the child sex-supporting lobbyists did receive hundreds of thousands of pounds from the VSU. Earlier this year former health secretary Patricia Hewitt (Above) was forced to apologise for her dealings with to the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange . Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman (left) and her husband, home affairs spokesman Jack Dromey (right), have previously strongly denied giving any support to the Paedophile Information Exchange group . The Albany Trust, which was founded to support ‘sexual minorities’, received £65,750 between 1974 and 1980. The trust invited representatives from PIE and a group called Paedophile Action for Liberation to a series of meetings in 1975 to discuss setting up a paedophile support group and publishing an information pamphlet about paedophilia. In 1977 the Home Office expressed ‘some disquiet’ about the way in which the trust was carrying out its work, the report noted. In 1970 the Albany Trust funded the translation of the findings of a Dutch government inquiry, known as the Speijer Report, which looked at lowering the age of consent for homosexuals. Campaigner Mary Whitehouse alleged that PIE obtained this English translation several years later and sold it for £1 per copy. A second charity, Release, which offered advice on issues including drugs, medical and housing problems, was given £410,500 by the VSU between 1974 and 1984 via the Princedale Trust. In 1975 Release moved to 1 Elgin Avenue in London. The same year Release allowed PIE to begin using the same address for correspondence. The Home Office report said it was ‘impossible to determine’ whether VSU money given to the two charities was indirectly used to support PIE’s work, although it noted no evidence was found to confirm that it did. A Whitehall inquiry found 'clear evidence' that £476,250 was granted to the organisations while the Home Office was situated in its former location in Petty France, Westminster (above) It also emerged that prosecutors decided in 1998 not to lay child abuse charges against Liberal MP Cyril Smith (left) despite ruling they were likely to succeed and that former home secretary Lord Brittan (right) insisted allegations that he failed to deal properly with allegations of child abuse were completely without foundation . The report said the whistleblower’s account of seeing a Home Office document from about 1980 that listed a grant renewal of £30,000 for PIE was ‘credible’. But the review concluded that ‘on the balance of probabilities’ no money was given to PIE. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale who exposed Cyril Smith’s abuse and led calls for a full inquiry into the alleged official cover-up of child abuse, said: ‘This report raises as many questions as it answers about the Home Office’s use of public funds to support groups linked to the Paedophile Information Exchange. ‘This does little to end concerns about the Home Office’s handling of child sexual abuse allegations over many years. ‘Releasing the report on the same day that the Home Secretary announced a major public inquiry into these issues will make some people wonder whether there has been an attempt to bury its findings.’","Inquiry found 'clear evidence' that £476,250 was granted to organisations .

"A quarter of children in Britain are living in poverty, a controversial report by a United Nations agency claimed yesterday. Millions ‘have fallen prey to the dangers of austerity’ during the recession years, Unicef said. Britain was even ranked 25th on a child poverty league table of 41 developed countries – below Romania, Bulgaria and Chile. The proportion of children in poverty is higher in the UK than in France, Germany, Holland or Australia . However, critics last night described a measurement that assesses children in the UK as worse off than those in Eastern Europe as ‘worthless’. They said Unicef was using distorted measures to paint a false picture of the real levels of poverty in Britain. Calculations are relative to average income – so Britain appears to be worse than countries where most people are poor, because average incomes in the UK are higher. In the latest of a succession of highly critical reports about Britain by UN agencies, Unicef said child poverty in the UK increased by 1.6 percentage points between 2008 and 2012 to 25.6 per cent. Topping a table of countries deemed to have best protected children during the recession was Chile, where child poverty was said to have dropped by 8.6 points. Unicef attacked the Government's cuts to benefits for contributing to a rise in child poverty since 2008 . Policy: Jeffrey O'Malley is behind the report . The UN official behind the Children of the Recession report is Unicef director of policy and strategy Jeffrey O’Malley. The Canadian has spent his career working for the UN and other global organisations. Mr O’Malley is an active user of Twitter, which he uses to publicise not only the UN agency’s activities but his other interests, which include campaigning against climate change, and supporting the Global Drug Policy Commission, which wants to see drug abuse decriminalised. Before joining Unicef Mr O’Malley spent 20 years working for HIV and AIDS campaign groups. For 11 years he ran the HIV/AIDS Alliance, which is claimed to be ‘the world’s largest international development non-governmental organisation specialising in HIV and AIDS’. He then moved to the UN Development Programme, an agency which has also provoked controversy in Britain. In 2011 it published a ‘human development index’ that put Britain in 28th place, below recession-ravaged Greece, Spain, Italy and Ireland. Mr O’Malley took over the policy role at Unicef in 2012. In Romania, in 12th place, child poverty fell 2.3 points, while the measure dropped by 0.6 in 20th-placed Bulgaria. The Children of the Recession report said many affluent countries had suffered a ‘great leap backwards’ in terms of household income. Jeffrey O’Malley, Unicef’s head of global policy and strategy, added: ‘The impact on children will have long-lasting repercussions for them and their communities. ‘All countries need strong social safety nets to protect children in bad times and in good – and wealthy countries should lead by example, explicitly committing to eradicate child poverty, developing policies to offset economic downturns, and making child well-being a top priority.’ UNICEF’s use of ‘relative poverty’ in its report is unpopular in Britain. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has been trying to stop Whitehall using such measurements because they are seen by many to record levels of inequality, rather than poverty. Relative poverty counts people as poor if they live on an income below a poverty line, set at 60 per cent of median income. But if the median income in a country rises, so do the number of people who appear to be in ‘poverty’. Conversely, if everyone is poor, but median incomes are low, it will suggest fewer people in poverty. However, critics condemned the methods used by the UN agency to arrive at its figures. Jill Kirby, former chief of the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, described the findings as ‘worthless’ and said Unicef should be using measures of ‘real deprivation’. A source close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Unicef is using ‘out of date statistics’ and said national data showed that around 300,000 fewer children are now in poverty. In another unflattering table of national comparisons, yesterday’s report also highlighted Britain’s ‘NEETs’ – young people who are not in employment, education or training. Unicef found that NEETs rose from 12.1 per cent in 2008 to 13.3 per cent in 2012, placing the UK 14th out of 41 on the league table – below Turkey and Mexico. ‘Many will suffer the consequences for life,’ the report said. In fact Turkey has more than doubled the percentage of NEETs aged 15 to 24 compared to Britain, and Mexico close to double. But by looking at relative changes in the years 2008 to 2012, Unicef put both countries higher in its league table. The report said Britain should ‘review’ its economic policies as a ‘priority’ and raise working tax credit, increase benefits in line with inflation, and push up the minimum wage for under 21s. Other UN reports have criticised Britain. Last year the UN’s special rapporteur on adequate housing, Brazilian Raquel Rolnik, angered Tory politicians when she demanded the abolition of the so-called ‘bedroom tax’. And South African official Rashida Manjoo claimed that sexism in Britain is worse than elsewhere and that public spending cuts were making things worse. Bad parents should be given government classes on how to cuddle their children, according to a major new report published last week. Politicians have been reluctant to ‘call out’ bad parenting, despite this having a bigger impact children than money or schooling, the former Labour minister Alan Milburn said. Mr Milburn, who was brought in by David Cameron as the Government’s social mobility Tsar, attacked MPs for being ‘tentative and timid’ about bad parenting. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left) has attacked the Tories for blocking the introduction of ‘meaningful’ new child poverty targets following Alan Milburn's report into social mobility . Child poverty is now a bigger problem than during the 1960s, the National Children's Bureau warned last week. It said Britain is at risk of becoming a place where 'children's lives are so polarised that rich and poor live in separate, parallel worlds.' It found that around 3.6million children are now living in relative poverty today compared with 2million in the late 1960s. He called for a national parenting campaign, funded by cutting childcare tax breaks from families with at least one parent earning more than £100,000 a year. Mr Milburn’s report also calls for the best teachers to be paid more to work in deprived areas, action to close the gap in GCSE results between rich and poor youngsters and for universities to admit 5,000 more students from disadvantaged backgrounds by 2020. It also says that unpaid internships should be made illegal, and that the ‘living wage’ should be introduced by 2025. The recommendations come amid warnings that the generation of workers will stay poorer than their parents throughout their lives unless 'urgent action' is taken to boost wages and slash youth unemployment. Mr Milburn said the UK was at risk of becoming a ‘permanently divided’ nation, with the poorest in society left behind. It says that the country is likely to see an unprecedented rise in child poverty over the next decade, amid the biting impact of welfare cuts and low pay.","Children's rights body blamed Coalition cuts for increase in child poverty .

"A Tory grandee today warned that he would sue for libel if newspapers repeat false internet rumours linking him to paedophilia. In an unusual move, Sir Peter Bottomley issued a public denial of any involvement in child sex abuse in a bid to counter false claims circulating on websites. Sir Peter said people were using the current controversy about an alleged cover-up of child sex abuse at Westminster to ‘restart’ disproved rumours about him from the 1980s. Sir Peter Bottomley, married to the former Conservative Cabinet minister Virginia Bottomley, issued a public denial of any involvement in child sex abuse in a bid to counter false claims circulating on websites . Sir Peter, who is married to the former Conservative Cabinet minister Virginia Bottomley, told Radio Four’s Today programme that people were also now wrongly suggesting that he may have visited the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, south-west London, which is at the centre of some of the current claims. The Elm Guest House is alleged to have been the scene of paedophile activity and sex parties attended by politicians and other prominent figures in the 1970s and 1980s. Visitors are said to have included the late Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith. Sir Peter, 69, successfully sued The Mail on Sunday in 1989 after it printed a false story about him. Today he said he would have no hesitation in doing so again if the rumours appear in print. He said: ‘People are trying to restart [the rumours]; people are trying to somehow to connect it to the Elm Guest House, a place I’ve not been to, where I’ ve not been involved. And I give this public warning - if any substantial publisher links me in any defamatory way, they can expect the same kind of action as The Mail on Sunday got.’ Sir Peter dismissed suggestions there had been a conspiracy to cover up abuse by Establishment figures . Sir Peter, who said he had always gone out of his way to help whistleblowers, said he backed the idea of a wide-ranging inquiry into claims that senior figures were involved in child sex abuse, provided it did not interfere with police investigations. But he dismissed suggestions that there had been a major conspiracy to cover up abuse by Establishment figures. He said successive governments did not take seriously enough the activities of groups like the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, ‘partly because people couldn’t believe it, partly because there may have been one or two senior people in the police or some other forms of public life’. But he added: ‘The idea that there could be an organised group that could stop things happening is, I think, imagination. ‘If I tried to organise a conspiracy on something I knew a lot about I think it would fall apart in two or three days. If this were an organised conspiracy there would be much more there.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Worthing West MP issues public denial of any involvement in child abuse .

"Tom Daley marked his return to his hometown of Plymouth in the best possible way by taking gold on the last day of the British Gas Diving Championships. There was a tremendous buzz at the Plymouth Life Centre on Sunday. Daley, the Olympic 10-metre platform bronze medallist, unveiled his new twister dive - a forward three-and-a-half somersaults with one twist pike - that no one had performed before. Tom Daley (centre) on the podium having won the British platform title at the British Gas Championships . The 20-year-old, whose highest scoring dive was the front four-and-a-half somersaults tucked with a mark of 96.20, finished with 493.70 points to secure his second national title. He beat 14-year-old Matt Dixon while City of Leeds' Matty Lee got the bronze. 'I dived pretty well considering it was the first competition I have done in about five months,' said Daley. 'Everything was steady, nothing was amazing but nothing was bad but I'm looking forward to building on that in the competitions to come. 'My dive, the new twister, went pretty well actually. It was all there. 20-year-old Daley, in action back home in Plymouth during the British Gas National diving Championships . Daley celebrates with his Coach Jane Figueiredo after winning the Men's platform final in Plymouth . 'I could have done a little better on some of the elements, like getting my entry better, but that all comes with a new dive. The more I do it, the better it will get.' Daley, who moved to London to train a year ago, is looking forward to competing at the World Championships this summer in Kazan, Russia. 'It's the first opportunity to qualify for the Olympic Games so I need to make sure I'm in the best shape,' he added. 'But we've got the World Series before that, so there are lots of chances to practice my new dive and make sure that I am in the best competition shape.' The London 2012 Bronze medallist used his new twister dive for the first time during the final in Plymouth . In the other event on the final day, five-time British champion Rebecca Gallantree captured gold in the three-metre springboard. Gallantree missed her second dive in the final but hit back in the third round with her front three-and-a-half somersaults piked. She finished with a score of 304.20, while club team-mate Katherine Torrance got silver and Plymouth's Rhea Gayle settled for bronze. Daley returned to his home town Plymouth to win the national platform gold medal on Sunday . 'My reaction is a little bit mixed,' Gallantree said. 'I did two really good dives which I am really happy with but then the other three weren't so good. The younger divers are coming through really quick. 'I mean Katherine is looking great who was in second place and Rhea pulled out a really great performance. The depth in women's springboard is amazing. 'Four or five years ago there were a couple of divers at the top and then there was just no one behind but now we've got so many girls pushing those big scores and it's fantastic.'","Won British platform title with 493.70 points scored, 66.55 ahead of second .

"Happily ever after: Pro-marriage campaigner Harry Benson and his wife Kate, who argue that policy must be changed to support married couples . Children are more likely to be in single-parent families in Britain than anywhere else in Western Europe, figures have revealed. Almost one in four live with a lone mother or father, compared to about one in six across the rest of the EU. Britain is now ahead of Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and France, where the number of youngsters living with just one parent is dropping – or rising more slowly. The figures point to the dramatic impact of family breakdown and have been linked to a ‘meteoric rise’ in cohabiting relationships. A pro-marriage group is calling on politicians to do more to encourage couples to wed – and stay together. The Marriage Foundation obtained a breakdown of the most recent figures – for 2012 – from the EU’s statistics arm Eurostat. According to its analysis published yesterday, 24 per cent of dependent children in the UK lived in single-parent families – up three percentage points on 2010 and marginally ahead of Belgium. The figure for Belgium, rounded to 24 per cent by Eurostat, was up by just two percentage points since 2010. In Denmark, France and Ireland, the percentage fell. The only EU country with a higher figure than Britain was the eastern state of Latvia, where sky-high divorce rates have pushed up the number of single parents. In Britain, by contrast, divorce rates have been falling and family break-up is largely a matter of collapsing cohabiting relationships. Harry Benson, of the Marriage Foundation, said: ‘While most lone parents do an amazing job with fewer resources, few have chosen lone parenthood as their lifestyle choice. 'Our research clearly shows that in the UK’s case – and that of other countries in Western Europe – this rising rate of lone parenthood is a symptom not of a rising divorce rate, but instead by the meteoric rise in the numbers of children brought up by unmarried parents.’ He said it was ‘essential’ for policymakers to face up to the realities of a generation brought up in single-parent households to avert a ‘host of negative social and economic implications’. He added: ‘Western Europe policy must focus on supporting existing marriages. Being brought up in a stable two-parent household is essential in affording children the decent start in life they deserve.’ The number of British children in lone-parent families rose rapidly in the 1980s, helped by rising divorce rates and increasing numbers of single young women who chose to bring up children alone with help from the benefits system. Scroll down for video . However, divorce rates in Britain started falling in the 1990s and are now back to mid-1970s levels. The Marriage Foundation report said: ‘While the phrase “lone parenthood” is a good indicator of the trend, it understates the full extent of family breakdown, as many lone parents go on to form new relationships. ‘Those who do so have still experienced family breakdown, but are no longer classified as lone parents.’ Children who have been through break-ups are said to be less likely to do well at school and more likely to suffer from adverse effects such as poor physical and mental health, unemployment and drug abuse and crime. Couples are married in only 56 per cent of British families, according to the results of the 2011 national census. Meanwhile, the number of cohabiting couples with children has risen to more than a million. Such relationships are estimated to be three times more likely to end in break-up than marriages, and a typical cohabiting relationship that does not lead to marriage lasts no more than three years. Marriages, by contrast, last 11 years on average and a high proportion of couples are separated only by death. David Cameron has spoken regularly about the need to encourage marriage. But so far Coalition ministers have offered only a minor tax break, worth up to £200 a year, to lower-income married couples. Some senior Tories, including former Chancellor Lord Lawson, have called for fully transferable tax allowances for married couples with children.","In 2012 around 24 per cent of UK children lived in single-parent households .

"Many adults will admit to telling white lies to children to make their lives a little easier. But research has found children can spot this tactic, and can even tell when their parents or teachers are deliberately withholding information from them. Once spotted, a study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found children will then try to fill in the gaps in the information themselves. Children can tell when adults are omitting information or bending the truth, (illustrated with a stock image), according to a new report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Once this tactic has been spotted, the children will try to fill in gaps in the information themselves . Children aged six and seven were given a toy to explore on their own until they discovered all of its functions. One group of children received a toy that had four buttons, each of which activated a different function, while the other group was given a toy with one button. Then the children watched as a ‘teacher’ demonstrated the toy – only pointing out one function. The children were asked to rate how helpful the teacher was, using a scale from 1 to 20. Children who knew the toy had three more undemonstrated functions gave much lower ratings than children who knew it was the toy’s only function. In a follow-up experiment, the same ‘teacher’ demonstrated a second toy and only demonstrated one of its four functions. Children who had previously seen a demonstration they knew to be incomplete explored the toy more thoroughly, suggesting that they did not trust the teacher to be fully informative. Determining who to trust is an important skill to learn at an early age because so much of our knowledge about the world comes from other people, explained Hyowon Gweon, lead author of the paper  which is published in the journal Cognition. ‘When someone provides us information, we not only learn about what is being taught, we also learn something about that person. If the information is accurate and complete, then you might also trust that person in the future,’ she said. ‘But if this person has taught you something wrong, has made a mistake, or has omitted something that’s important for you to know, then you might want to suspend your trust, be sceptical of the information he provides in the future, and even seek other sources of information.’ The study builds on a 2011 paper in which the team of researchers investigated how children behave when a teacher explained only one function of a toy that can do four different things. They found children spent most of their time exploring only the function the teacher had demonstrated. However, children who received no instruction spent more time exploring all of the toy’s features and ended up discovering more of them. The study builds on a 2011 paper in which the team of researchers investigated how children behave when a teacher explains only one function of a toy that can do four different things. The new research looks at their reaction to the teacher. An image of a child playing is pictured . In the new study, Dr Gweon wanted to investigate what children thought of the teacher who did not fully explain what the toy could do. She said: ‘Previous studies about children’s trust in informants or teachers focused on whether children distinguish, and learn differentially from someone who says something false from someone who’s telling the truth. ‘Going beyond those sensitivities to truth and falseness, what I wanted to see in this study is whether children are also sensitive to someone who’s telling the truth but not the whole truth - someone who didn’t tell them everything that they ought to know.’ In the experiment, children who had  to work out additional functions of the toy distrusted a teacher's explanation about a second one (stock image) In the first experiment, children aged six and seven were given a toy to explore on their own until they discovered all of its functions. One group of children received a toy that had four buttons, each of which activated a different function, while the other group was given a toy with only one button and function. Then the children watched as a ‘teacher’ puppet demonstrated the toy to a ‘student’ puppet. For both toys, the teacher’s instruction was the same. He demonstrated only one function - the windup mechanism. After the demonstration, the children were asked to rate how helpful the teacher was, using a scale from one to 20. Children who knew the toy had three more undemonstrated functions gave much lower ratings than children who knew it was the toy’s only function. In a follow-up experiment, the same ‘teacher’ demonstrated a second toy and only demonstrated one of its four functions. Children who had previously seen a demonstration they knew to be incomplete explored the toy more thoroughly, suggesting they did not trust the teacher to be fully informative. ‘This shows that children are not just sensitive to who’s right or wrong,’ Dr Gweon said. ‘[They] can evaluate others based on who’s providing information that is enough or not enough for accurate inference. They can also adjust how they learn from a teacher in the future, depending on whether the teacher has previously committed a sin of omission or not.’","A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology found children can spot when information is being deliberately held back .

"A man-made party island set to rival Ibiza is being planned to attract revellers to the Arabian Gulf. Dream Island will be able to host around 20,000 partygoers with two 'mega clubs', four beach clubs, five hotels and 100 restaurants. The island will be in Ras Al Khaimah, which is only a 40-minute drive from Dubai, once construction is completed. New Ibiza: An artist's impression of the planned Dubai party island ' Dream Island' where alcohol will be freely available . But unlike Dubai where a personal licence is needed to drink alcohol, booze will flow freely on the island. Sales and marketing director George Saad said: 'We're trying to make it the new Ibiza - a mini Ibiza dedicated solely to partying. 'People will be able to come here, stay in the hotel party at clubs on the beach, anything in the world you can do. 'And we are trying to attract festivals to come here - like Burning Man.' Plans: The initial designs for Al Marjan including 'Dream Island' which developers hope will rival Ibiza and attract revellers to the Arabian Gulf . Expanding: The plans for the party island are on show alongside other building projects planned across the region at the Dubai Property show . The developers of the third of four islands that make up Al Marjan are looking to attract £3.2billion of investment. The party town is on show and seeking British investors at the Dubai Property Show, in Kensington Olympia, this weekend. The show was launched on Friday by UAE royalty Sheikh Mohmmed bin Maktoum Al Maktoum. Original: Ibiza has been popular with partygoers for years but the new 'Dream Island' planned in the UAE is promising to rival the Spanish resort . The 4 million square foot island will feature no homes and will only be open to visitors and residents of the neighbouring islands. The island was built in 2013 and development to make it into a clubber's paradise is expect to be finished by 2018. The four islands of Al Marjan stretch nearly three miles out into the sea and cover an area of 2.7 million square metres.","Man made island will be able to host 20,000 revellers in one go .

Young women are flooding the Chinese website Weibo with images of their unshaven underarms . The competition, called 'Girls not plucking their armpit hair' is said to be challenging social norms and encouraging women to keep their body hair . So far, thousands of pictures have been uploaded to the site, with the competition's page gaining over 28million views. Many of the images show the women proudly showing off their underarm hair, while others are pictured with their ponytails tucked under their arms. It is thought that organisers of the competition will eventually put together a top 10 of the best pictures, although there doesn't seem to be any prize for first place. The competition's page on Weibo has had over 28million views and organisers are to put together a top 10 of the best pictures . It appears that the trend has swept China after several other campaigns that have urged women to embrace their natural beauty. Last month, the Hairy Legs Club trend on tumblr was inviting women to post their photos to make a statement about social expectations of beauty. It features pictures of women from around the world, who have decided to ditch the razor and not shave their legs and have uploaded pictures of themselves to the site. It is thought that organisers of the competition will eventually put together a top 10 of the best pictures, although there doesn't seem to be any prize for first place . While female students at an Arizona university last month were being offered the chance to earn extra credit by not shaving their armpit hair for a whole semester. The unconventional offer was made by women and gender studies professor Breanne Fahs at Arizona State University as a way to get her students to challenge social norms. And earlier this year as part of the Natural Beauty series, London-based photographer Ben Hopper recruited dozens of models and actresses to grow out their body hair with the aim of proving that they don't need to conform to expectations to be attractive.","Women have been taking to Weibo posting selfies of their underarm hair .

"Don't blame Hannibal Lecter - he can't help being a callous, murdering monster. New research suggests psychopaths lack basic hard-wiring in the brain that enables most people to be compassionate and caring, scientists say. They say MRI scans revealed distinct differences in the way highly-psychopathic individuals' and ordinary people's brains reacted when they were shown footage of people being intentionally hurt. No empathy: Psychopaths like Sir Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter character lack basic hardwiring in the brain that enables humans to feel compassion, scientists say . Scientists at the University of Chicago studied 80 male prisoners aged between 18 and 50 who were assessed for psychopathic traits. Around 20 to 30 per cent of the U.S. prison population is believed to be affected by psychopathy - compared with one per cent of the general population. Study participants underwent brain scans while being shown videos of people being intentionally hurt and others of faces reacting to pain. Their findings, published today, may help to shed light on why criminal psychopaths like cannibal Lecter, played by Sir Anthony Hopkins, appear void of remorse or compassion. Empathy: Scientists observed reduced activity in key areas of the brain when psychopathic individuals were shown videos of people being hurt . Psychopaths displayed significantly less activity in key areas of the brain including the amygdala - an almond-shaped bundle of neurons which plays an important role in processing emotions like fear, anger and pleasure. The stunted response observed . in the amygdala and in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was consistent with . previous studies of psychopathy, researchers said. Converseley, more activity was seen in the striatum and insula regions. The high activity recorded in the insula region surprised the scientists, as the area is central to emotion. 'A marked lack of empathy is a hallmark characteristic of individuals with psychopathy,' said lead researcher Professor Jean Decety. 'This is the first time that neural processes associated with empathic processing have been directly examined in individuals with psychopathy, especially in response to the perception of other people in pain or distress.' Psychopaths are known to be responsible for a disproportionate amount of repetitive crime and violence. The University of Chicago study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, said: 'The neural response to distress of others such as pain is thought to reflect an aversive response in the observer that may act as a trigger to inhibit aggression or prompt motivation to help. 'Hence, examining the neural response of individuals with psychopathy as they view others being harmed or expressing pain is an effective probe into the neural processes underlying affective and empathy deficits in psychopathy.'","Psychopathy affects around 20 to 30% of U.S. prison population .

"A 'cursed' Roman ring that was dug up by a farmer is believed to have been the inspiration behind JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit. The piece of gold jewellery was discovered close to the Roman town of Silchester, Hampshire, in 1785. The celebrated author was called in to investigate the incredible story of the ring's past just two years before his famous novel was published. Tolkein's inspiration? The tale of this 'cursed' Roman ring discovered in a field by a farmer in Silchester, Hampshire, in 1785, may have inspired JRR Tolkien to write The Hobbit . The story of the jewellery's unlikely link to the 20th century author is told in a new exhibition opening today at The Vyne, a National Trust-owned property in Hampshire. It is thought it was unearthed by a farmer ploughing his field close to the Roman town in the 18th century. Historians believe the large 12g gold ring once belonged to a Roman called Silvianus but he put a curse on it after it was stolen. It is so large that it will only fit on the finger of a gloved hand. It has a Latin inscription which says 'Senicianus live well in God'. JRR Tolkien, who was an Oxford University professor with expertise in Anglo-Saxon history, is thought to have drawn inspiration from the tale when he started work on The Hobbit. An unlikely source? Frodo Baggins with the ring in one of the Lord of the Rings films based on JRR Tolkien's novels . The book, which has a ring at the centre of the plot, was published in 1937 and was well-received by critics. The novel, which was turned into a film last year, was the precursor for the Lord of the Ring trilogy. After the ring was discovered in a field it is thought to have been sold to the Chute family who owned The Vyne for centuries before it passed into the hands of The National Trust in the 1930s. It was several decades after the farmer found it before the curse was discovered on a tablet in Lydney, Gloucestershire, more than 100 miles away. The victim, Silvianus, knew the thief responsible and called on the god Nodens to strike him down. The great archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler, the director of later excavations at Lydney, realised the connection between the ring and the curse tablet, and in 1929 asked JRR Tolkien to work on the etymology of the name Nodens. Film adaptation: Gollum in The Hobbit film who snatches the ring - not knowing its value . Film series: A shot from the Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Ring. The ring which may have inspired the books goes on display today . The tablet says: 'Among those who bear the name of Senicianus . to none grant health until he bring back the ring to the temple of . Nodens.' Senicianus apparently only got as far as the field in Silchester when he abandoned the ring. For many years, the ring, with an image of the goddess Venus, lay almost forgotten in a corner of the Library at The Vyne. The new exhibition explores whether the book inspired Tolkien to write the Lord of the Rings. It also contains memorabilia from The Tolkien Society's own archive, and a first edition copy of the book signed by the author. Dave Green, manager of The Vyne, said they wanted to tell the public the remarkable tale of the ring. 'I was looking for the ring to show a . visitor, and I walked right past the case with it – that's when I . decided we really had to make more of this amazing thing,' he told The Guardian. Exhibition: The ring has gone on display today at The Vyne, a property owned by the National Trust, in Hampshire . Dr Lynn Forest-Hill, Education Officer for the Tolkien Society: 'The influences most often cited for Tolkien’s creation of The One Ring usually take the form of literary or legendary rings such as the Ring of the Niebelungs, or the old king’s ring in the 14th century story of Bevis of Hampton. 'It is, then, particularly fascinating to see the physical evidence of the Vyne Ring, with its links to Tolkien through the inscription associating it with a curse. 'It is well known that in 1929 Tolkien worked on the etymology of the name Nodens mentioned on a Roman curse stone. 'Significantly, in the context of his non-academic writing, he would have read the Latin inscription on the curse tablet: Deuo Nodenti Silvianus anilum perdidit …. inter quibus nomen Seniciani nollis permittas sanitatem perfera [t] translated as: To the god Nodens: Silvianus has lost a ring….among those who bear the name Senicianus to none grant health.”","Tolkien investigated tale of Roman ring two years before The Hobbit was published .
