"To an almost audible sound of thousands of hearts breaking in two, Benedict Cumberbatch has announced that he is off the market. The man widely seen as the most desired thespian in the world — despite looks that he himself compares to both an otter and Shergar the racehorse — has made it known that he is engaged to his girlfriend, Sophie Hunter. In a bare, if momentous, paragraph in the Forthcoming Marriages section of The Times, the dreaded news was delivered: ‘Mr B. T Cumberbatch and Miss S. I Hunter. The engagement is announced between Benedict, son of Wanda and Timothy Cumberbatch of London and Sophie, daughter of Katharine Hunter of Edinburgh and Charles Hunter of London.’ Scroll down for video . Getting hitched: Benedict Cumberbatch and Sophie Hunter pictured at the French Open earlier this year . It's official: The couple's engagement was formally announced in The Times . Cue mourning from millions of adoring women around the world — the ‘Cumberbitches’, as they are known, or, as Benedict prefers it, ‘Cumberpeople’. ‘I think [that name] sets feminism back so many notches,’ he once said. One fan offered: ‘On one hand I’m so happy for him and for her. . . she gets to have this wonderful man, she can wake up next to him, kiss him and see his beautiful smile every day. On the other hand I’m crying my eyes out.’ ‘Is it normal to be so happy and yet so heartbroken?’ asked another. There was a common theme in the messages from the 172,000 followers of the ‘Cumberbitches’ Twitter page and the 117,000 fans of his Facebook page: surprise. ‘She moves fast,’ observed one Cumber-fan. Benedict and Sophie have known each other for five years, but have been dating for only five months . Benedict and Sophie have known each other for five years, but have been dating for only five months — perhaps even less. ‘It’s wonderful news and we are all thrilled for him,’ said a friend of the actor. ‘I’ve never known him happier, and she is a wonderful woman — very intelligent. ‘They have known each other a long time, but the romance is recent. It really only took off over the summer, maybe even late summer. ‘It has moved fast, but when something works, it works. They are very good for each other and are very much in love. They have mutual friends and mutual interests in the theatre. It just works. They have clicked. It is lovely news.’ When Benedict first met Sophie in 2009, he was dating actress Olivia Poulet, whom he met at university . In recent years, Cumberbatch has been linked to an array of beautiful women. When he first met Sophie in 2009, he was dating actress Olivia Poulet, whom he met at university. They split after 12 years in 2011. He has also been linked to Russian model Katia Elizarova, Star Trek co-star Alice Eve, daughter of celebrated actor Trevor Eve, and actress Liv Tyler. Cumberbatch was also rumoured to be in a relationship with socialite Lydia Hearst, 30, daughter of newspaper heiress Patricia Campbell Hearst, who was kidnapped in the 1970s by Left-wing urban guerilla group the Symbionese Liberation Army. She is the granddaughter of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. Cumberbatch has been linked to an array of beautiful women including Russian model Katia Elizarova . Cumberbatch’s last serious girlfriend before Sophie was the fashion designer Anna Jones, from whom he separated in 2012, after a romance lasting not quite a year. Though he has been linked to a number of women over the years, people who know Benedict insist he has not dated even half of them. One said: ‘He’s not a “player”, although he does go to lots of parties and talks to lots of girls.’ So how did Sophie manage to bag this most eligible — yet elusive — bachelor? In fact, the pair met while working together on set in 2009. They remained friends, but their romantic relationship only took off this summer. The pair were first spotted watching the French Open tennis together in Paris in June. Since then, they have been seen having dinner together in London — entering and leaving the restaurant separately. They also attended the wedding of one of Cumberbatch’s schoolfriends in September. He has also previously been linked to actress Liv Tyler, the daughter of Aerosmith's Steven Tyler . And last month the actor was seen in Edinburgh, where Miss Hunter’s mother lives. The young couple were seen strolling in the unseasonal sunshine around the city’s Botanic Garden. Some speculated he had gone to the city to ask Mrs Hunter for permission to make Sophie his wife. However, a close friend of the star told me last night this was not the case: ‘They just got engaged this week. He didn’t go up to Edinburgh to ask her mum first. He asked her, I think, on Monday, then they rang to put the advert in on Tuesday.’ Friends say Cumberbatch, 38, is now trying to work out when he will be able to tie the knot — between filming Sherlock in January, attending the Oscars in March (he’s a hot tip for Best Actor this year for his role as gay computer genius Alan Turing in The Imitation Game) and a three-month spell as Hamlet at The Barbican next autumn. Cue mourning from millions of adoring women around the world — the ‘Cumberbitches’ have been left distraught by the news of the actor's impending nuptials . Apparently his every moment is accounted for until well into 2016, so perhaps there will be a long engagement — although pals are saying they think he will manage to find a slot over the next 12 months. So, who is the woman who has won Sherlock’s heart? Like Cumberbatch — who went to Harrow on an art scholarship — she is both artistic and well-connected. Indeed, in this she is a perfect partner for Benedict, the son of two actors, who was raised in Kensington, West London. Although he can get cross if anyone says he is posh, his grandfather was a Naval submarine commander and had his wedding covered at length in The Times. (Meaning, rather sweetly, that this engagement announcement was part of family tradition.) Cumberbatch was also rumoured to be in a relationship with socialite Lydia Hearst, 30, daughter of newspaper heiress Patricia Campbell Hearst . His great-grandfather, Henry Cumberbatch, was the British Consul General in Smyrna, Turkey, and received a CMG — an honour sometimes known as ‘Call Me God’ — or Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael & St George. Sophie, meanwhile, has royal and military ties. Her uncle is Sir Malcolm Ross, an Eton and Sandhurst-educated member of the Royal Household. Sir Malcolm, married to Sophie’s aunt, Susan, was knighted in 1999. He was in the household of the Prince of Wales between 2006 and 2008, and has served as an equerry to the Queen. He was responsible for organising the funerals of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the Queen Mother, and was put in charge of preparations for Baroness Thatcher’s funeral. Meanwhile, Sophie’s grandfather was General Sir Michael Gow, a high-ranking figure known for his witty portraits of Army life. Sir Michael, who died last year, was General Officer Commanding Scotland from 1979, and one of the first British officers to enter the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Sophie was raised by her mother, her parents having separated when she was young. Her father, Charles, is a professional cards player, but started out in insurance. She has two brothers, Patrick and Timothy. While studying modern languages at Oxford, she began dating artist Conrad Shawcross — once named by Tatler as one of the ‘100 Most Invited’ — the son of William Shawcross, the Queen Mother’s biographer, and art critic Marina Warner. Sophie moves, then, in very similar circles to Cumberbatch, whose friends include actress Rebecca Hall and Downton’s Laura Carmichael, who plays Lady Edith, and Dan Stevens, who famously left the show. Benedict and Sophie even have matching porcelain complexions, prominent cheekbones and Bunsen burner blue eyes. While he launched his acting career straight out of Manchester University, his fiancee reached academic heights. After Oxford, she went to theatre school L’École Internationale de Theatre Jacques Lecoq in Paris — meaning she is fluent in French. In 2005, she worked with songwriter Guy Chambers on album The Isis Project, in which she sings in French. She is a talented pianist, too. Cumberbatch’s last serious girlfriend before Sophie was the fashion designer Anna Jones, from whom he separated in 2012 . But it is in acting and the theatre that she has made her way. She was awarded the prestigious Samuel Beckett Award in 2007 for writing and directing a play called The Terrific Electric at The Barbican. She co-founded the Lacuna Theatre Company, and has directed plays and operas, including the 2010 revival of Henrik Ibsen’s Ghosts on Broadway. Her highest-profile acting work was a minor role in 2004 film Vanity Fair. And she and Benedict met while acting in the obscure movie Burlesque Fairytales in 2009. Now, it seems, he is ready for marriage. Last night, his PR, Karon Maskill, told me: ‘Ben and Sophie are old friends — they have worked together in the past and they just share many of the same friends.’ In a magazine interview last year, Cumberbatch said: ‘Without using words like marriage, children and family . . . put it this way, I hope I’ve got other people to look back with me [when I’m older]. I hope I’m surrounded by family.’ It was his broadest hint yet that he was finally ready to settle down and take on the role of his life: as a bridegroom.","Benedict Cumberbatch has announced that he is off the market .

"A newborn baby may have accidentally suffocated after she was crammed into a single bed with her parents while they slept after drinking vodka and smoking cannabis. Alesha Roberts was 16 days old when she died after her mother Letisha, 22, lay her between herself and her boyfriend for a cuddle. Alesha was found unresponsive in the bed at 4am and died, despite efforts to save her. Letisha Roberts with her daughter Alesha, who died after spending a night in bed with her parents . Letisha Roberts pictured leaving the inquest into her daughter's death at Blackpool Coroners' Court . Police investigating the incident charged Ms Roberts with causing Alesha's death by 'overlaying' and child neglect but the allegations were dropped after medical reports differed over whether or not the baby died of suffocation. The hearing was told Ms Roberts - who has since given birth to another daughter - had been given 'safe sleeping' advice for a baby by a midwife yet she was not 'fully conscious' of the risk factors of drug use, drink and smoking in front of the child. The tragedy occurred in November 2012 after Ms Roberts from Old Swan, Liverpool, took Alesha to visit Alesha's Iraqi father at his one bedroom flat in Blackpool. The father, named only at the hearing as 'Ahmed', had moved to the seaside resort to find work but has since returned to his native country. Ms Roberts intended staying for two days after Alesha's birth on October 30. The inquest heard how the baby would normally sleep in her own cot at home but had to sleep in a car seat whilst at the flat. On November 15, the couple spent the afternoon in Blackpool before returning to the flat at around 5pm ordering a takeaway, consuming vodka and smoking cannabis and cigarettes whilst Alesha fell asleep in the car seat. Ms Roberts told the hearing: 'I had never smoked cannabis before that night. He smoked it from time to time but he would always go outside. I said I wanted to go, but he said: ""no stay"". 'I said ""what are we going to do"" and he said we'd get a drink from over the road. We had a drink and then had a takeaway.' Letisha (pictured) awoke about 4am to find her daughter unresponsive and quickly called emergency services . She said the vodka was diluted with orangeade and she insisted she was not drunk, while she said she had no more than two puffs on the cannabis joint. 'I just had a little bit. I did one or two (puffs) and that was it. It was only one or two.' Alesha woke around 2am needing to feed and Ahmed passed the little girl to Ms Roberts who then breast fed the baby in bed whilst he fell asleep. Ms Roberts told the inquest that she had lay the baby between them both in the single bed in order to 'cuddle'. 'As soon as you feed her she was happy,' she added. 'We were all having a little cuddle. I wouldn't say it was a conscious effort to keep us all together. It was a single bed. I think Ahmed woke up before me, it seems to black out. 'He said something was wrong with the baby. I would say she was on her back not wedged. She had a little sick, I went to wipe it off and I jumped. It clicked. I rang the ambulance straight away. We were doing CPR, blowing in her mouth.' Alesha was pronounced dead at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Blackpool. Both parents were later arrested and interviewed under caution but Ahmed was later released on the basis that he had fallen asleep and was not to know that the baby had been placed between them. The former home of Alesha's father, where she died while her parents slept . Blood samples were taken from both and despite no alcohol being found because of the time lapse since consumption, drugs were found. Detective Chief Inspector Anthony Baxter said: 'Letisha had been told about co-sleeping, and on top of that our evidence shows that drink has been taken and that drugs have been taken. There's an unsafe sleeping environment in a single bed between two people - potential overlaying. 'The CPS took the decision to charge Letisha and a decision was taken not to charge Ahmed on the basis that although Ahmed had got the baby out of the car seat and handed to Letisha to feed, he fell asleep and wouldn't know the baby was left in bed.' Ms Roberts was due to face trial at Preston Crown Court in March until a doctor produced a report which said it could not necessarily be concluded that overlaying, or suffocating by lying on top of the child, was the cause of Alesha's death. A post mortem examination showed no injuries were sustained to the baby and a medical cause of death was given as unascertained. The court heard that the baby's death could have been attributed to 'overlaying' by one of her parents but other factors could have increased the baby's risk of Sudden Infant Death (SID), including the parents' alcohol and drug use, smoking and a hot room. Pathologist Dr Gauri Batra of the Manchester Children's Hospital said the fact Alesha slept in the car seat was not 'the best position' but accepted that it hadn't been a routine. She added: 'In my opinion co-sleeping and alcohol consumption, drug use, smoking - not necessarily around the baby, but parental smoking even in a well ventilated room, smoking by parents during pregnancy or after, is a risk factor. The room being too warm and co-sleeping in a small space is another risk factor for SID.' The inquest heard that Alesha, who was born slightly premature at 36 weeks and with a low birth weight of 5lb 4oz, had been developing well. Midwife Joan Cottington said that she had discussed 'safe sleeping' with Ms Roberts and that she was given a pack as well as discussions about the dangers of co-sleeping. The midwife had visited her Liverpool home on November 6 and 11 and upon both visits there had been 'no concerns'. Letisha, pictured right and left with her daughter Alesha, who died after sleeping in a bed between her mother and father . She added: 'Throughout my time with Letisha she was always very good at communicating. I was aware that she was visiting Blackpool to see her partner, I was surprised that Letisha had placed her in bed with her. Letisha was always very compliant.' Assistant coroner for Blackpool Mr Derek Baker returned a narrative conclusion saying there would always be 'unanswered questions' and added: 'What I don't know is whether it was a natural cause of death and what the effects of sleeping with parents was. The sleeping environment in my opinion put her at greater risk of cot death or overlaying. 'I'm satisfied that Letisha you were anxious to do your best for Alesha and you did co-operate with the midwife. I don't believe you were fully conscious of the risk factors. I can't say whether the outcome would have been different if Alesha hadn't shared the bed. 'This may have been overlaying, it may not. It may be cot death. All the answers will never become apparent in this case. The sleeping environment may have contributed but the extent of the contribution, if any, is unclear.'","Newborn baby found dead after sleeping in bed between mother and father .

"A white Florida man accused of fatally shooting an unarmed black teenager during an argument over loud music was a cold killer who fired multiple times into an SUV, a court heard today. His defense countered during his retrial that the man felt threatened and fired in self-defense. Michael Dunn, 47, is on trial for a second time, charged with first-degree murder in the November 2012 killing of Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old from Marietta, Georgia. Michael Dunn, 47, (left) is on trial for a second time, charged with first-degree murder in the November 2012 killing of Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old from Marietta, Georgia . Prosecutor John Guy said Dunn (left)  fired at the SUV 'with malice in his heart and intent in his hand' while the defense said it happened because he felt in imminent danger. Right: Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old from Marietta, Georgia . No one denies that the shots fired at the SUV with four teenagers in it killed Davis. Prosecutor John Guy said Dunn fired at the SUV 'with malice in his heart and intent in his hand' while the defense said it happened because he felt in imminent danger. Dunn was convicted previously of attempted second-degree murder for firing the shots, but that first jury deadlocked on the first-degree murder charge. He faces at least 60 years in prison for the previous convictions. State Attorney Angela Corey shows witness Steven Smith a hat and asked him if he ever saw it above the roof line of the car that Jordan Davis was in during the shooting . State Attorney Angela Corey questions witness Steven Smith about where he was when he saw Michael Dunn shoot at the car full of teens . Guy said during his opening statement Thursday that Dunn's actions, such as not immediately calling 911 after the shooting, showed that he was unconcerned about repercussions. '(Dunn) went back to his hotel, poured a tall rum and coke, took his little dog for a walk, ordered a pizza, watched some TV and went to sleep,' Guy said. Defense attorney Waffa Hanania said Dunn didn't think he'd done anything illegal. The argument at a convenience store began when Dunn, who is from Satellite Beach, Florida, and was in Jacksonville for his son's wedding, asked the teens to turn down loud rap music. One teen in the car did turn it down, but Davis told him to turn it back up, and started arguing with Dunn. After the argument, Dunn grabbed a pistol from his glove box and fired at the SUV, Guy said. The SUV left the scene, but Dunn got out of his car and continued firing, Guy said. Prosecutor John Guy, right, shakes hands with Jordan Davis's father Ron Davis before the start of the Michael Dunn retrial . Guy said Davis had just been acting like a teenager, and 'cowered' once he saw Dunn's gun. 'For all of his loud music and his four-letter words and teenage bravado, in the end, when it came right down to it, Jordan Russell Davis was just that, a teenager,' Guy said. But Dunn had had enough of the 'mouthy, audacious' teenager, Guy said . Dunn's defense contends he made a split-second decision to fire out of fear, though prosecutors say no gun was ever found in or near the SUV. 'The only thing Jordan Davis ever had in his hands was a cellphone,' Guy said. Hanania said: 'He acted to defend himself. And he believed that he acted lawfully.'","Michael Dunn, 47, is accused of killing Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old, in 2012 .

"Microsoft has created an interactive billion pixel image of its Seattle base - and hidden a few surprises in there. The firm work with more than 100 local artists and performers to hide them within the image. It claims the new image is the most ambitious interactive image ever created. Click below to see the interactive image, which you can control with the red buttons . The full panorama consists of 2,368 twenty-two-megapixel images. This resulted in two 10-gigapixel half panoramas, recording the city in fantastic detail, but still somewhat lacking in people. The team then returned to the same spot six times with a Canon digital SLR with lenses ranging from 400 mm to 600 mm to capture the artists and performers, before combining them into the final, 20 gigapixel (20,000 megapixels), super high-resolution 360-degree panorama image. 'The Seattle Gigapixel ArtZoom project pushes the boundaries of the technology to deliver an image that allows anyone to pan and zoom through the city of Seattle with an amazing level of detail,' Microsoft said. 'In a fun twist, visitors to the site can discover more than 100 artists and performers in public spaces and in private buildings, near important Seattle landmarks and on random street corners, acting alone or interacting with onlookers. It said the key to the project was finding a location with a clear view of Seattle. 'We started looking at Seattle as our canvas,' said Michael Cohen, who spearheaded the project, and also did much of the location scouting and secured the condo building that was eventually used. 'We first sought out the perfect rooftop location from which to shoot such a panorama. 'We were lucky enough to find the Bay Vista condominium building, and thanks to the gracious owners, get access to amazing 360-degree views that include the Seattle Center, the Olympic Sculpture Park, and Seattle's stadiums, as well Mount Rainier, Puget Sound, and Lake Union.

James Mahoney decided to insert a spacecraft into the image to show what Seattle's future might look like . Local band Future Fridays decided to dress as cardboard robots for their appearance in the massive panoramic image . 'We also discussed the project with John Boylan, who has deep roots in the Seattle art scene. 'He helped us attract great interest from the arts community to come out and help create this celebration of the arts in Seattle. 'John introduced us to Elise Ballard, who coordinated the efforts of everyone involved in producing the entire piece. 'And finally, videographer Kris Crews helped us assemble a team to shoot video footage of the artists and performers from the ground.' The full panorama consists of 2,368 twenty-two-megapixel images. The team stitched these images together using Microsoft Research's Image Composite Editor (ICE) software, which is available for free. This resulted in two 10-gigapixel half panoramas, recording the city in fantastic detail, but still somewhat lacking in people. 'Over the next few weeks, we climbed to the roof six more times to capture individual artists, acrobats, and other performers at dozens of locations visible in the panorama,' said Cohen. These photos were captured from precisely the same spots on the roof as the panorama shots, using a Canon digital SLR with lenses ranging from 400 mm to 600 mm. One of the incredible panoramas captured by the team. Landmarks visible include the Seattle Center, the Olympic Sculpture Park, and Seattle's stadiums, as well Mount Rainier, Puget Sound, and Lake Union - as well as 100 local performers and artists . The team began work on the project in October - and it was finally launched today. 'Beginning on a brilliant sunny day in October, we climbed up to the roof to capture our first panorama using a Canon digital SLR camera, a professional 400 mm lens, and a Gigapan robotic tripod head,' said Cohen. 'We captured two half panoramas from opposite corners of the roof because no single spot had a perfect view in all directions (this explains the seams you see). 'While we captured still shots of the performers from the roof, video crews filmed the events on the ground.' At Microsoft Research, Celso Gomes digitally put the the individual shots of artists and performers into the final 20-gigapixel panorama. Meanwhile, the video footage from the ground and other media was assembled to create short video vignettes. Finally, Eric Stollnitz built a web site that provides the world access to the panorama and other media. 'The result is the Seattle Gigapixel ArtZoom,' says Microsoft.

"A giant sculpture of a hedgehog has been unveiled on Clapham Common after a survey found that a quarter of people in the UK have never seen the animal in the wild. The 12 foot long, eight foot wide, seven foot tall structure took a team of artists two months to build, and it has been keeping hundreds of visitors to the South London park entertained since being unveiled last week. The sculpture is mainly made from 2,000 soft wood spikes that resemble a hedgehog's spines, and a mixture of willow and coconut fibre that takes on the appearance of fur. Scroll down for video . Ambitious: The huge structure took a team of artists two months to build, and has been keeping hundreds of visitors to Clapham Common entertained since it was unveiled last week . Craft: The sculpture is mainly made from 2,000 soft wood spikes that resemble a hedgehog's spines, and a mixture of willow and coconut fibre that takes on the appearance of fur . The giant creature was erected to mark the launch of Sir David Attenborough’s new Natural Curiosities series on UKTV channel Watch tomorrow evening. A survey for the TV channel found that millions of Britons claim they have never seen a large number of animals that live in the wild in the UK. The study also found three quarters were concerned about dwindling numbers of hedgehogs and thought more should be done to protect them. A quarter of Britons say they have never seen a wild hedgehog, rabbit or fox, while 26 per cent claim never to have spotted a grey squirrel or frog, and 36 per cent say wild deer have eluded them. The average Briton takes only 16 walks in the countryside each year, dramatically limiting their exposure to wildlife, the survey of 2,000 adults revealed. As part of the Natural Curiosities programme, Sir David studies hedgehogs and even admired a small scale model of the Clapham Common sculpture before it was built. He said: 'The hedgehog is one of Britain’s greatest natural curiosities and this sculpture is a fitting tribute to one of our best loved species.' 'It is interesting to note that many of our supposedly common species are also hard to spot in the wild.' Star: The giant creature was erected to mark the launch of Sir David Attenborough's new Natural Curiosities series on UKTV channel Watch tomorrow evening . 'The fact that a quarter of British adults have never seen a wild hedgehog suggests that we are witnessing rapidly dwindling numbers, which is a concern. 'Hedgehogs have some interesting habits and play a very useful part in keeping down all kinds of insect pests. 'What people don’t know about hedgehogs is that in the wild they have vast territories, and they roam for miles on end. And how do they mate? - very carefully!' Andy Billet, one of the sculptors who worked on the project, said: 'This was my most challenging brief to date and we spent weeks replicating the skin tones and spikes to make the build as lifelike as possible.' As part of their work on the programme, researchers discovered that people aged 55 and over explore the countryside the most, averaging 17.6 walks per year. Those aged 25 to 34 go on the fewest walks at an average of 12.6, followed by 18 to 24-year-olds at 12.9.","Seven foot high sculpture was unveiled on Clapham Common last Tuesday .

"This is the moment one-eyed police killer Dale Cregan was smuggled into hospital by armed guards for medical treatment. Cregan, who murdered PC Nicola Hughes, 23, and 32-year-old PC Fiona Bone while on the run for killing two gangland rivals, was escorted to North Manchester General Hospital for pre-planned treatment earlier today. The 31-year-old killer, who is serving a life sentence at HMP Manchester, was led from the hospital wearing a green and yellow prison jumpsuit, with the words 'HM Prison' emblazoned on the back. Scroll down for video . This is the moment one-eyed police killer Dale Cregan was smuggled into hospital by armed guards for a medical check-up North Manchester General Hospital . The  killer, who is serving a life sentence at HMP Manchester, was led from the hospital wearing a green and yellow prison jumpsuit, with the words 'HM Prison' emblazoned on the back, and an orange towel over his head . He also had an orange towel covering his head, seemingly in a bid to conceal his identity. Witnesses at the hospital told how armed officers sealed off the various entrances to the building early this morning. Police marksmen were then seen guarding the hospital's B block, where wards, outpatients services and day surgery facilities are based. Seven police vans and at least one armed response vehicle were also seen parked at the hospital while other uniformed officers patrolled the grounds on foot. Cregan left the hospital at around lunchtime and was then returned to his cell at the prison, formerly known as Strangeways. Cregan, 31, murdered two policewomen in a gun and grenade attack while on the run for killing two gangland rivals . Assistant Chief Constable Zoe Sheard, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'A prisoner was allowed to attend hospital today, under police escort, in order to undergo pre-planned hospital treatment and has now been safely returned to custody. 'Where prisoners may require hospital treatment, GMP's role is to assist in the safe movement of that prisoner. 'Thorough policing plans are put in place to ensure the safety of members of our communities and we work very closely with the hospital to ensure appropriate security measures are in place to protect both staff and patients.' News of his hospital visit comes weeks after a security operation to get Cregan to hospital was cancelled at the last minute. Cregan murdered Mark Short, 23, and his father David, 46 - the head of a notorious east Manchester crime family - in 2012. While he was on the run for those murders, he killed the police officers in a pre-planned attack by luring them to a house in the Mottram area of the city with a bogus report of a burglary. Cregan, a cocaine dealer from Droylsden, then shot the officers dead before throwing a hand-grenade on their bodies. He is now serving life at Strangeways and has been told he will never be released. Officers were seen guarding the hospital's B block, which is home to wards, outpatients services and day surgery facilities . Police marksmen patrolled the site after officers sealed off the entrances to the hospital early this mornin . During his time in jail so far, Cregan has proved to be a testing prisoner. At one stage, he went on 'hunger strike' at having to serve his sentence at HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire. He went to Ashworth High Security Hospital in Merseyside for assessment before being returned to Strangeways. And just a few weeks ago it was reported that Cregan was in segregation after being caught for taking drugs in his high security prison cell. Murders: The killing of PC Fiona Bone, left, and PC Nicola Hughes, right in an ambush by Cregan shocked Britain . After Cregan was jailed in 2013, it emerged that gangland rivals had put a £20,000 contract out on Cregan to take out his good right eye. He allegedly told his friends he lost his left eye in a fight in Thailand. A spokesman for the Pennine Acute Hospitals Trust, which runs North Manchester General Hospital, said: 'We are unable to disclose details or comment regarding the care or treatment of individual patients.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'We cannot comment on individual prisoners or security issues.'","31-year-old was escorted to North Manchester General Hospital this morning .

"A career criminal who sold a set of power tools on eBay to the former special constable they were stolen from avoided jail today. Jonny Shaw was upset when police told him they would not investigate the £4,000 theft from his van so he surfed the internet until he found them and bought them back. Mr Shaw then agreed to meet with seller Julian Morris to collect the tools, but also tipped off Lancashire Police who came with him to arrest the suspect, who later admitted handling stolen goods. But despite trying to sell the stolen collection of electric saws, screwdrivers, drills and other maintenance tools, he was given a suspended prison sentence at Burnley Crown Court. Caught: Julian Morris, left, was arrested after £4,000 of stolen tools he was selling on eBay were tracked down by the owner Jonny Shaw, right, who then called in the police . Detective work: The former special constable was upset when police failed to properly investigate so traced the tools himself . This was because he insisted he had nothing to do with the thefts themselves and bought the tools at a car boot sale. The theft occurred last April after Mr Shaw left the work equipment in his Ford Transit van. His wallet containing £275 cash plus his sat nav were also stolen. Describing what happened next Mr Shaw told the court: 'I reported it to the police but they weren't doing anything about it and were just giving me a crime reference number - although an officer did come out to see me. Initiative: Mr Shaw told police he was meeting Morris to collect the stolen tools, and they arrested him . 'I was mad. I've had my tools stolen before and had to buy them again. I was going mad, this was my livelihood and a lot of people were let down because of it. 'I have 10 men working for me and we were having to hire tools in for three or four days. The lads couldn't work that day, it had a big effect for three or four days. It was an absolute nightmare.: . 'I thought the tools would probably be sold on the internet so I had a look. I couldn't believe he had put them on so soon. I got robbed on a Tuesday and by the Thursday they were on Ebay. I kept a watch on them on the site and two days later he put some more on. 'I was zooming in on the pictures and the serial numbers'I thought 'they are definitely mine' and I thought 'I've got to win them'. Mr Shaw successfully won the auction and contacted the seller to get his address, telling him he could come and collect them. He added: 'I rang the (police) inspector and said that I knew they were mine straight away. He was really good and said he'd meet me round the corner of the address. 'On the day of the pick up I had my mate. This guy came out of the house and he had my tools. He kept coming to the door with everything else that had been robbed. I identified all the tools. I said to my mate that if I start coughing that means they are my tools. 'As soon as he came out I started coughing. The police came flying around the corner in a van and a car and started running up the drive. He had his back to them so he didn't know what was going on and they pinned him. Just before, I had said ' they are my tools'. He didn't know what to do, he said 'let me say sorry to my wife'. His wife and kids were there, I felt awkward because she was crying. 'I had all the receipts on me. All my tools are insured because of last time but works tools are not insured unless they are in a vault. 'When I found the tools the Burnley police were brilliant. 'After the inspector was saying 'good work'. It felt good. It felt good that I got it back, it was a relief. I always wanted to be in the police but when I did it I didn't like it - it was too much paperwork. Sentencing: Morris, who also admitted possessing cannabis, was given eight weeks in jail, suspended for two years, with 100 hours unpaid work and must pay £85 costs and an £80 victim surcharge . Morris's address was searched and officers returned further tools to Mr Shaw. Six items which had been stolen were not recovered including the wallet and £275 cash. Police also found a hand-written list of power tools. Morris' van was searched and four snap bags cannabis were found. In interview Morris said he got the tools from somebody he knew who helped him on car boot sales - but refused to name. When questioned he added: ' I have done it because we are skint. Somebody said to me they had a load of drills to sell and offered me 20 per cent. I asked if they were dodgy and they said they weren't.' He had 14 offences on his record. Morris who was also admitted possessing cannabis was given eight weeks in jail, suspended for two years, with 100 hours unpaid work and must pay £85 costs and an £80 victim surcharge. In mitigation defence lawyer Miss Sara Lyle, defending, said: 'He does a bit of everything, usually house maintenance. Work was scarce, he was offered the opportunity to sell the goods by a mate and foolishly took up that opportunity. He says he knew there was something dodgy about it but had absolutely nothing to do with the theft. 'He certainly doesn't know where the wallet and other personal items are. There is absolutely nothing sophisticated about this. He used his own name, his own eBay account and his own address.'","Jonny Shaw found tools online and bought them off criminal Julian Morris .

"An eight-year-old boy ran up a £1,200 bill watching videos on his mother's iPad  - after it hooked up to paid-for internet connection during a powercut. Aaron Little spent hours watching the popular Minecraft videos on YouTube, not realising that the tablet had connected to the expensive 3G network at his home in Edinburgh. The youngster usually watches videos online via the family's WiFi, but recent plumbing works at their flat forced labourers to turn off the power supply. It meant the device automatically connected to Vodafone 3G network and his mother Lyndsey was sent a bill for £718.59, and asked to pay within a week. Scroll down for video . Eight-year-old Aaron Little ran up a £1,200 bill watching videos on his mother Lyndsey's iPad - after it hooked up to a premium contract net connection during a powercut . She said she was warned that unless she did her contracts would be terminated and the bill raised to £1,209.14. But Ms Little, a single mother on benefits, has been unable to pay, and has now been landed with the bigger figure. Aaron said: 'We just got a big, big bill and we have to pay. I'm upset because I didn't know about it. I only know because my mum told me.' The mother-of-four, said she was 'devastated' by the bill run up by her youngest son. She said: 'We are trying hard to stay afloat with bills and stay on top of things. Then a bill for £700 came out of nowhere. I was devastated. He usually watches videos online via the family's WiFi - but recent plumbing works at his flat forced labourers to turn off the power supply - and the tablet connected to the 3G network. His mother Lyndsey was sent a bill for £718.59, and asked to pay within a week . She said she was then sent a letter and warned that unless she paid her contracts would be terminated and the bill raised to £1,209.14 . 'I was shocked when I saw the bill. It said that if I didn't pay within a week, they'd cut off everything and I would have to pay £1,200. 'I sat Aaron down in the car when he came back from school. He cried and cried and said he was sorry. He's only eight and it wasn't his fault. 'He was just watching Minecraft. There's nothing wrong with that. It's educational and teaches kids to build things. 'I don't know what we can do. It's upset the whole family.' Aaron ran up the bill when he accidentally connected to the premium network while council workers put a new shower into his flat over three days in early August. Minecraft was created in 2009. At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.' They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves. Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape. Players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available. There are even YouTube channels dedicated to showing people how to play the game, which in same cases make the owners enough money in advertising to quit their jobs. Ms Little, who has been a Vodafone customer for 12 years, tried to discuss the situation with staff at the company's store on Princes Street, Edinburgh. She explained the bill amounted to three-quarters of the family's monthly income and that they could not afford to pay the weekly minimum instalments of £60. But Vodafone employees told her she was responsible for paying off her son's debt. The company said it would terminate the contracts linked to the iPad and two phones used by her other sons. Lyndsey said: 'Everything on the iPad was password-locked to avoid hidden charges or inappropriate content. 'I went in to see Vodafone and they said the iPad was working fine and that the problem had been caused by my son. 'I showed them my benefits and paper work and told them how much I get, but they didn't want to see it. 'I wish they could have been more understanding. They are treating me like they don't care and it's left me upset. 'I had to explain to my other sons that their phones may have to be cut off. 'I wish Vodafone would tell you upfront about these little loopholes in the system. These devices should have a £100 cut off to protect families with low incomes.' A spokeswoman for Vodafone yesterday said they would be prepared to arrange a payment plan with her. Minecraft was created in 2009.

Earlier this month a mother was left with a £7,000 bill after her 12-year-old son ran up huge charges playing a popular online game on his phone. Theresa Cox said she and her son James were not given any warning about costs of up to £240 a day on Clash of Clans. T-Mobile said Supercell, the developer of the game, was responsible for setting the charges. But Ms Cox, of Breaston, Derbyshire, said she might now have to sell her car to pay the debt. James was playing Clash of the Clans on his smartphone where he was paying £240-a-day for add ons . Ms Cox's son inadvertently paid extra charges that are used to progress in the game.

"The New Delhi High Court has overturned the conviction of a man accused of killing and raping a woman he called his 'mother'.

Consequently, he is acquitted for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.' The court also overturned Lal's rape conviction claiming: 'As regards the offence punishable under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC, the woman was aged over 60 years, thus beyond the age of menopause. 'We find force in the contention of the counsel for the appellant (Achey) that even if the sexual intercourse was forceful, it was not forcible and contrary to the wishes and consent of the deceased. 'Hence, we are of the opinion that it has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant committed sexual intercourse with the deceased contrary to her wishes or her consent. Consequently, he is also acquitted of the rape charge.' The New Delhi High Court said 'besides the injuries on the vagina there is no other injury mark on the body of the deceased or the appellant to show there was any protest by the deceased'. They said: 'It has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant committed sexual intercourse with the deceased contrary to her wishes or consent'.

"Don't play with your food - that's what we're always told when we're younger - but this huge tiger must have missed that message. The consequences, though, are adorable - these stunning images show the carnivorous beast frolicking about with a tiny fawn - who can't quite believe its luck. The baby deer might have been saved by maternal instinct - as the tiger was pregnant, and showed absolutely no interest in turning it into a tasty meal. Scroll down for video . Unlikely friends: A huge, pregnant female tiger and tiny fawn spent half an hour playing together in a tiger reserve in central India . Play with me! The tiger had no interest in eating what would normally be its food, and instead only wanted to care for and play with the fawn . Gallivanting through the trees: Amateur photographer and call centre worker Pawan Menon captured the images while on safari . A mother's instinct: The fawn may have been saved by the fact the tiger was pregnant and had a strong maternal instinct, treating it like her cub by carrying it around . The photos show the two unlikely friends running together for around half an hour through the trees and long grass in Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra, central India. They were taken by amateur photographer Pawan Menon, 46, from Kerala, who is a call centre worker by trade, but was lucky enough to stumble across this rare event while on safari. 'It was early morning when I was roaming with a friend in the jungle scouting for tigers. Suddenly I noticed one. At first, I thought she was playing alone but then I spotted the tiny fawn by her side,' he said. Come back! The baby deer trots through the long grass away from the tiger, which lies down for a rest and to bask in the sun . Nap time: The giant tiger takes a minute to lie down in the road and take a quick kip after a busy half hour playing with the fawn . On the prowl: After nudging its fawn friend to run off to freedom, the pregnant tiger wanders back into the grasses . 'It was the most astonishing thing to see. I felt my heart beating fast as I was certain it was the end for the fawn. But the tiger sat calmly and played with the baby.' Even though the tiger was in no mood to eat, the fawn was still visibly frightened. Mr Menon said it even made an attempt to run but the tiger caught it, carried it gently in its mouth and took it back to the spot they were sitting. 'The two were together for half an hour playing, running and jumping. Then the tiger gently carried the fawn by its neck - as it would carry its own cub - and eventually started nudging it to run away,' he added. 'It was unbelievable. I'm sure the fawn couldn't believe he was still alive as he ran off! But the fascinating episode restored my belief - wild animals only kill when they're hungry.'","The tiger and fawn played together for around half an hour before the carnivore let the baby deer go .

'I love that. Loooove it. It is really real for them and for me. I love these guys. I feel connected. They make me feel like part of the team.' The New York Post reports that Stow's attackers Louie Sanchez and Marvin Norwood were both sentenced to eight years in prison. Unfortunately, Stow will have to spend more than eight years of his life experiencing just a portion of what he once did. Stow is a divorced father of two who can barely take care of himself let alone his children. Stow lives with his parents Dave and Ann who look after him. He is also looked after by his sisters Erin and Bonnie and by professional caregivers. 'There are holes in his memory,' his mother told USA TODAY. 'Some things he remembers, some things he needs reminding of, some things he knows happened because he has been told about them.' Even though he won an $18 million settlement from Dodgers stadium because they didn't provide enough parking lot security, he may not see most of that money for a very long time. Stow requires extremely expensive 24-hour care. 'Bryan has made progress to a certain point because he is a fighter,' one of his attorneys, Tom Girardi said. 'But his mind and body are never going to be the same again. That is what was taken away from him,' he added.

"A stunning portrait of a Parisian actress by Edouard Manet sold for $65 million at auction in New York on Wednesday, a record for a work by the French impressionist artist. The painting entitled 'Spring' was sold at Christie's Wednesday evening for $65 million, almost doubling the previous record of $33.2 million for the French impressionist. Spring is considered to be a Manet masterpiece and was first presented at the 1882 Paris Salon. It depicts actress Jeanne Demarsy in a floral dress and bonnet as an evocation of spring. Sold: This undated file photo provided by Christie's shows French Impressionist Edouard Manet's Spring which sold at Christie's in New York on Wednesday for $65 million .

Artist: Édouard Manet, the French artist born in Paris France, is pictured here, . Manet had intended allegorical works of the four seasons but only completed Spring and Autumn. One of the leading artists of the impressionist movement, he was famous for his portraits and scenes from everyday life. He died in 1883 at 51. 'Spring' has been in the same American collection for over a century and has been on loan at the National Gallery of Art for the last two decades. The first owner was Manet's friend, the journalist Antonin Proust. It was later in the collections of the operatic baritone and important impressionist collector J.B Faure and French art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who sold it to a private collector in 1909, where it remained. Christie's said Wednesday's sale brought in over $165 million. Prices included the buyer's premium. First owner: The first owner of 'Spring' was Manet's friend, the journalist Antonin Proust, seen here in a painting by Manet .

The investigation involved the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption Bruce Lander . Six SA police officers were arrested and will face charges including abuse of public office . Mr Burns said theft had included 'anything from liquor, to alcohol, to tools' as well as electronic devices. Today's arrests followed a joint investigation by the state's Independent Commissioner Against Corruption and the corruption-busting branch of the SA Police.

"As any music fan knows, stuffing headphones into a bag causes them to become tangled, or damaged. The Mous Musicase attempts to solve this problem by storing the headphones inside a phone case fitted with a ‘winder.’ This means the headphones are protected, but they can also be extended or retracted easily, by spinning a handle on the back.

Inspired by headphones constantly getting tangled in a bag, (pictured) experts from the University of California, San Diego, recently investigated the probability of knotting, the type of knots formed and the dependence on string length in their study . Inspired by headphones constantly getting tangled in a bag, experts from the University of California, San Diego, recently investigated the probability of knotting, the type of knots formed and the dependence on string length in their study. Dorian Rayner and Douglas Smith confirmed that ‘complex knots often form within seconds’ and that stiffer wires are slightly less likely to form such mind-boggling tangles. When shaken up, the wires form coils and the loose end weaves though the other strands, creating the annoying knots. Professor Robert Matthews from Aston University then set out to investigate this so-called ‘Murphy's Law of String’. Murphy’s law is an adage that basically means anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. Similarly, Matthews said that any string that can get into knots, will do. Building on earlier mathematical research, he concluded that string - and headphones - really does have a perverse tendency to knot spontaneously. He also found the longer the string is, the more likely it is to spontaneously knot. Joining the ends together dramatically reduces the probability of the string performing the manoeuvres needed to form knots, making tangling less likely, something he calls the Loop Conjecture.","The Mous Musicase is available for the iPhone 5, 5S and 6 .

"The first Iraqi Peshmerga troops have arrived in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane, where they will assist Kurdish fighters in their battle against rampaging Islamic State militants. Ten fighters entered the northern Syrian border town this morning after crossing the border from Turkey, with a further 140 reinforcements set to follow in the coming hours. Clearly worried about the new arrivals, Islamic State militants tried to capture the Mursitpinar crossing overnight, leading to fierce clashes at a border point forming the only way in and out of Kobane. News that reinforcements have arrived in Kobane came as the president of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region said he would be willing to send more Peshmerga troops to the battle-ravaged city if requested, but leaders there told him a small artillery support unit is all they need to drive ISIS out. Brave: Iraqi peshmerga troops are seen passing through Suruc - a Turkish town near the Syrian border - earlier this morning. Ten fighters entered Kobane today, with another 140 expected to arrive this afternoon . Force: An Iraqi peshmerga convoy travels towards to the Syrian border in the early hours of this morning . Speaking just minutes after the first Peshmerga fighters arrived in Kobane, local activist Mustafa Bani said the reason only 10 men had so far been able to enter the city was because the border crossing they are using to travel from southern Turkey has been targeted by militants from the Islamic State. The remaining 140 fighters plan to make the incredibly dangerous  200-yard journey from the Turkish border to a Kurdish stronghold inside Kobane over the coming few hours, he added. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the 10 peshmerga fighters entered Kobane around midday local time (9am GMT). The mission of the peshmerga troops is to help Kurdish fighters inside Kobane try to break the siege by Islamic State militants who first launched an attack on the city six weeks ago. The ability of the small force to turn the tide of battle will depend on the effectiveness of their weapons and on continued U.S.-led airstrikes against the extremists. News that reinforcements have arrived in Kobane came as the president of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region said he would be willing to send more Peshmerga troops to the battle-ravaged city if requested . Masoud Barzani said Syrian Kurdish leaders in Kobane told him a small artillery support unit is all that is needed to drive ISIS out, adding that the deployment would not been possible without U.S. and Turkish support . Heavy weaponry belonging to the Iraqi peshmerga forces are seen moving towards the Syrian border today . Turkish security officials stand guard as an Iraqi peshmerga convoy passes them en route to Turkey . Yesterday, a group of 50 Syrian rebels entered Kobane - also from Turkey - in a push to help Kurdish fighters there against the IS militants. The rebels are from the Free Syrian Army and were meant to help the long-awaited Iraqi peshmerga fighters and the town's Kurdish defenders. The Free Syrian Army is an umbrella group of mainstream rebels fighting to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The political leadership of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army is based in Turkey, where fighters often seek respite from battle. Despite dozens of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes, the Kurdish fighters in Syria - known as the People's Protection Units or YPG - have been struggling to defend Kobane against ISIS since mid-September. The jihadis offensive on Kobane and nearby villages has killed more than 800 people, activists say. The Sunni extremists captured dozens of Kurdish villages and still control parts of Kobani. More than 200,000 residents of the embattled Syrian city have fled into southern Turkey since fighting began. Celebration: Kurds wearing traditional headscarves wave at a group of Iraqi peshmerga fighters as they passed through southern Turkey on their way to Kobane yesterday . On their way: A peshmerga fighter flashes a V-for-victory sign as his convoy arrived at the Habur crossing along the Turkish-Iraqi border yesterday. The first 10 pershmerga arrived in Kobane earlier this morning . Transport: Iraqi Kurdish military vehicles carrying heavy weaponry belonging to the peshmerga fighters were pictured at Turkey's Habur border crossing yesterday afternoon . The American and Arab coalition has carried out more than 150 airstrikes against militants in and around Kobane since the first bombing raids were carried out in September . U.S. officials said the airstrikes have killed hundreds of ISIS fighters, helping to stall their advances. Under pressure to take greater action against ISIS - both from the West and from Kurds in Turkey and Syria - the Turkish government recently agreed to let the fighters cross through its territory. But it only is allowing the peshmerga forces from Iraq, with whom it has a good relationship, and not those from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Convoy: Kurds in Turkey celebrate as the peshmerga fighters crossed through the Habur crossing along the Turkish-Iraqi border yesterday morning . Reinforcements: A convoy of military vehicles transporting Iraqi peshmerga troops to Syria was seen snaking through the Turkish countryside yesterday afternoon . Ankara views Syrian Kurds defending Kobane as loyal to what it regards as an extension of the PKK. That group has waged a 30-year insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and NATO. Kurdish fighters in Syria have repeatedly said they did not need more fighters, only weapons. They distrust Turkey's intentions, accusing it of blocking assistance to the Kobane defenders for weeks before giving in to pressure and shifting its stance. Many suspect Ankara is trying to dilute YPG influence in Kobane by sending in the peshmerga and the Turkey-backed FSA.","Ten Iraqi peshmerga soldiers arrived in embattled Kobane this morning .

"Disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner is finally giving up on his dreams of being a public office holder. The New York Democrat admitted in a recent interview with Politico that his career in politics 'is probably over' now that he's been caught engaging in sexual dalliances with young women who are not his wife on two separate occasions. 'The only job I ever wanted more than Congress was mayor, and I don’t think that either of those two jobs are going to be available,' Weiner told Politico in an interview that was published on the site today. 'So, no, it’s not like, ""OK, how do I get back in?"" I’m not thinking that anymore,' he said. 'I think I kind of took my stab at that.' Former Republican Congressman Anthony Weiner is pictured here in New York City the after he lost the Democratic nomination to become the city's next mayor last year in September. Weiner acknowledged in a recent interview that his political career 'is probably over' Weiner and his son Jordan, 2,  walk the Tribeca Film Festival street in April. Weiner said in a recent interview that if he hadn't been pushed out of Congress after sending lewd messages to young women, he eventually would have left federal office to spend more time with his young son . Weiner resigned from his congressional seat in 2011 after a conservative news organization revealed that he had sent an explicit picture to a 21-year-old college student over his Twitter account. The married Congressman initially denied sending the lewd photo and suggested that he was the victim of a hack. But after the news organization, led by late conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart, accused Weiner of sending a second photo of himself to another woman, Weiner confessed to carrying on with half a dozen women online over a three-year period both before and after his marriage to Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Less than two years after exiting Congress Weiner attempted reenter politics by running for New York mayor. Early on in the Democratic primary the former congressman appeared to be on the verge of a political comeback. Three months later he found himself at the center of new sexting allegations, however. This time he was accused of having an secret relationship with a 22-year-woman named Sydney Leathers. Weiner acknowledged that he conversed with Leathers under the screen name Carols Danger from late 2012 right up to the time he announced his mayoral bid and to having sexual relationships online with up to 10 women but refused to drop out of the race. He quickly dropped to the back of the pack in the race, receiving just 4.5 percent of the vote when all was said and done. Sydney Leathers, then 22, is one of the young women who Weiner had inappropriate contact with after he exited Congress. Their relationship became public while Weiner was trying to make a political comeback last year . Since then he has penned columns for the New York Daily News and Business Insider and made television appearances on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher and a local New York news channel. 'It wasn’t like I wanted to see it as a career, but I still have an itch to scratch of having ideas about things and wanting to talk about them,' Weiner said of his rebirth as a political pundit. 'You don’t just after a 25-year career, caring about issues and caring about what’s going on in your city, just kind of turn it off,' explained. Weiner told Politico that he also earns a living through consulting. Another project he's in the process of setting up is a nonprofit restaurant that helps keep at-risk youth on the straight and narrow by providing them experience working in  food service. Despite his continued interest in national politics, Weiner indicated that he was happy to not be working in Washington anymore because it allows him to spend more time with his son, Jordan, who turns three this year. 'I would have quit Congress to be home with Jordan, plain and simple,' Weiner claimed. 'I would not be sitting around in Washington waiting for the Senate to come back into session to pass some CR. 'I could not imagine it any other way. I would’ve lost my marbles,' he proclaimed.","'The only job I ever wanted more than Congress was mayor, and I don’t think that either of those two jobs are going to be available,' Weiner said .

"Police are investigating the mysterious death of a dance instructor whose body was found at her California home just hours after she returned home from a Halloween party. Mendocino County sheriff's detectives are treating the death of 25-year-old Kayla Grace Chesser, from Willits, as 'suspicious' although there is 'no obvious evidence'. They have spoken to a man they believe was with Kayla at the time of her death and who was involved in a collision several hours after she died. Kayla Grace Chesser, 25, was found dead at her California home hours after returning from a Halloween party . The man is believed to have intentionally crashed his vehicle and was airlifted to an out-of-county hospital where he is currently being treated for serious injuries,The Press Democrat reported. Captain Greg Van Patten said deputies responded to a call by friends of the woman at around 6am on Saturday morning. He declined to give details on the cause of the death, other than to say it was not obvious. An autopsy is due to be carried out later today followed by toxicology tests. Kayla had been to a Halloween party with friends in Willits that night before returning to the home. It is thought that the man involved in the road collision had been with her during the night. Dance instructor Kayla was described as 'very talented' and 'just a beam of light. A loving, sweet, kind person' 'We have identified someone that was with her at the time of her death,' Captain Van Patten said. 'He was witnessed at the home just prior to her discovery.'

"Removing your tattoo increases the risk of skin cancer and is as dangerous as lying on a tanning bed, according to an expert. Dr Ian McDougall, based on the Gold Coast Queensland, believes not enough information is given to patients who undergo the procedure and said the industry should be better regulated. Dr McDougall said the laser procedure can cause problems when ink pigments embedded in the skin are broken up. Scroll down for video . Laser tattoo removal could increase your risk of skin cancer . 'If you're going to de-pigment an area, I'm not sure what your chance of skin cancer in that area is,' Dr McDougall said. 'I'm thinking it's going to be higher.' Queensland's radiation safety act requires owners and operators of laser tattoo removal machines to have a safety certificate, according to Nine News. Despite this requirement, no medical training is given to those removing ink from skin,  highlighting the lack of regulation in the industry. But lack of training is not the only risk to patients who undergo tattoo removal. Operators have been seen to favour cheap laser machines that have been described to consumer group Choice as causing damage to the skin. An unregulated machine that is popular among operators because of its cheap price is intense pulse lighting (IPL). According to Hilary Quinn, Melbourne Tattoo Removal proprietor, these machines increase the risk of burning or scarring. UV tanning beds will see a complete ban across most Australian states from the end of 2014.

"Couple wed in secret ceremony despite families' outrage . Kayley, 23, wants babies but Philip, 55, is about to become a GRANDDAD . It is not the kind of relationship one expects to go the distance. But today, a girl who married her 50-year-old biker lover in a secret civil ceremony has celebrated five years of marriage. Kayley Simock, now 23, was just 17 years old when she wed twice-divorced ex-roadie Philip Nash in 2007, a year after meeting him at a religious service where she was playing the guitar. The pair, who have a staggering 32 year age gap between them, infuriated their families when they wed in secret after Kayley's family tried to put a stop to the relationship. Best friends: Philip and Kayley share a passion for motorbikes, and say their friendship has helped them stick at their marriage . The receptionist nearly destroyed her relationship permanently after refusing to stop seeing ex-roadie Nash. Yet six years since they first met, they say they are still very much in love. Their path has never run smooth. Kayley, from Stourbridge in the West Midlands is the primary breadwinner after Phil was injured in a motorbike accident four years ago. And while Kayley is ready to start a family of her own, Phil is less keen as his only child, a 27-year-old daughter, will soon give birth to his first grandchild. Infatuated: The couple married in 2007 in a secret civil ceremony . Kayley said: 'In a way, we’ve proven the whole world wrong. It seemed like everyone was against us, purely because of the difference in our ages. 'I knew when we got together Phil was the man I wanted to be with. People said I was too young to know that, but I did. 'And the proof is in the pudding. We’re still very much in love. Not everything is easy, but that’s life. 'I can’t wait to have kids - I would have them tomorrow. But with Phil not working, money is tight, so he says we should wait a while. 'And Phil is about to become a grandfather - he’s already had his children and is conscious about our money situation. 'But Phil is not getting any younger. It’s crazy to think I am going to be a grandmother soon. I’m excited, but there’s no way anyone is going to call me Nana.' Five years after their marriage Kayley’s mum, Jayne, 46, has finally come to terms with having a son-in-law who is nine years her senior. However, Kayley says she lost most of her friends at the start of the romance who couldn’t understand why she was spending time with 'an old man.' She said: 'My mum was furious when she first found out about Phil. It destroyed our relationship for a long time. 'I still can’t talk to my dad about it and don’t see him very often. 'I’ve got virtually no friends left who are my own age because I felt I could never talk to them about me and Phil. 'My relationship is good with Phil’s daughter now but obviously it was strained at first. 'I don’t treat her as a step daughter and she doesn’t treat me like a step mum. Starting a family: Kayley says she would like babies, but Phil, who is about to become a grandfather, is more reluctant . 'Despite the massive age gap Phil and I are soulmates. Occasionally it will be an issue like when we are mistaken for father and daughter, which can be a bit embarrassing. 'Or sometimes Phil will want me to come home early when I want to stay out later. But we are best friends who always know what the other one is thinking.' Youthful Kayley was playing guitar in the church orchestra when she was approached by Phil. Despite being warned by her parents and church leaders that the friendship was ‘inappropriate’, the pair continued to meet. A year later they moved in together while Kayley’s mum was away for the weekend. Kayley said: 'We got a van and moved all my stuff into Phil’s flat. My parents weren’t listening when I told them how I felt. No regrets: Phil Nash, 54, and Kayley, now 23, devastated Kayley's family when they married five years ago, but today say they are blissfully happy . 'I couldn’t believe they were being so narrow-minded. I knew Phil was the man for me.' A year later, in 2006, the slim brunette - who still gets asked to prove her age when buying a lottery ticket - married Phil in a secret ceremony attended by only Phil’s family. She said: 'We got married at the registry office. I felt sad that my family couldn’t be there but I knew what I was doing. 'I don’t know how she found out but I got a text from my mum after the ceremony asking if I had just got married. 'I texted back 'yes', then I didn’t hear from her for months. Even if it meant losing my family I knew I had to be with Phil. After my parents stopped talking to me I still had no regrets. 'We’ve already made it five years. These days, there are plenty of marriages that don’t last that long, even when both people are the same age.' Phil receives £300 per month in incapacity benefit after being forced from his job as a car salesman following a bad motorbike accident. However, the couple are still able to pursue their love of biking and go out most weekends. Kayley said: 'When I’m at work Phil stays at home and does all the cooking and cleaning. 'It took Phil a bit of getting used to. We would like to have more money, but we’re happy for now. 'We both know Phil is likely to die before me but we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. 'There’s no point in worrying about it. I want to enjoy the here and now.'","Couple wed in secret ceremony despite families' outrage .

"Apple’s plans to take on TV with a live streaming box may have been pushed back until next year, but a patent has revealed clues about how it could be controlled. The application details a digital remote, in the form of an app for an iPhone or iPad, that changes channels, browses menus and could be used to schedule recordings. It would automatically connect to Apple’s set-top TV box, and unlike the current remote app, the patent shows a system that would work across phones, tablets and laptops. Scroll down for video . The application details a digital remote that changes channels and browses menus. (pictured). It would connect to Apple’s set-top TV box, and unlike the current remote app, the patent shows a system that would work across phones, tables and laptops. It could be used as an alternative to, or as well as, the current control . The patent appears to show Apple following Google’s Chromecast lead, which can already be controlled using a range of mobile devices. ‘Many media devices utilise remote controls for browsing through and selecting content,’ explained the patent. ‘However, known remote controls are too simplistic and are not user friendly.’ Rumours claim that Apple's TV set will use a 4K screen, making is four times sharper than even current HDTV pictures. The firm is also rumoured to be working with cable firms to allow it to show live TV as well as but films ans TV shows. Previous reports claimed it would run apps, and work with an iPad or iPhone as a remote control, which has been given a boost with the latest patent application. It may also include gesture controls, after Apple bought Israeli firm PrimeSense, or be controlled using voice. It continued that common remote controls are configured with up, down, left and right buttons, a selection indicator button, and maybe a keypad. But this layout is mainly suited for browsing ‘old-fashion numerical list television programming’, said the firm. Apple stated that a new paradigm exists for the way people browse for content, and text entry is now ‘very time-consuming when using a simplistic remote control.’ It also said that mirroring the display isn't a viable alternative, which is why it's proposing a digital remote. ‘Mirroring a display of a media device onto another display of another electronic device can result in the poor representation of the content. ‘For example, suppose a large screen television display can clearly display one hundred icons that are clear enough to decipher. ‘The same one hundred icons mirrored onto the small screen of smartphone would clearly be indecipherable. The patent appears to show Apple following Google’s Chromecast (pictured) lead, which can already be controlled using a range of mobile devices . Apple said controls (current Apple TV remote pictured left) are simplistic and not user friendly. It continued that many feature up, left, down, menu, select, right and play and pause buttons (labelled one to seven on the left-hand image), but this layout is suited for ‘old-fashion’ menus. Apple's proposed digital remote is pictured right . ‘Alternatively, the smartphone could only view a small portion of the mirrored display at a time, but doing so is not user friendly. ‘Mirroring technology does not adequately address the need for remote browsing of content.’ The application was filed last year, but only awarded last week. Apple sold more than $1 billion (£622 million) worth of Apple TV set-top boxes in 2013 and is investing heavily in the next generation of products, boss Tim Cook said at the company's annual meeting earlier this year.

According to a Facebook page which updates their followers Ashley and Tyson Gardner, from Utah, flew to see a specialist surgeon in California yesterday following a meeting with their doctor about their two sets of identical twins . The family posted this message to their Facebook today after the successful surgery . The couple also found out that Ashley's cervix is opening prematurely as a result of the condition. Ashley underwent surgery today and was given 'meds to halt any contraction that might occur.' A few hours later the anxious family revealed the surgery went well. They posted on Facebook: 'It went great. Dr. Chmait smiled and said, ""This has been a good day!"" Our tears have been replaced with relief and continue to pray for the babies safety and continued 'baking' for a good long time!! Stunned: This is the moment Ashley and Tyson Gardner, for Utah, found out they were having quadruplets in the summer after spending eight years trying to conceive. Above, Mrs Gardner stares at the screen in the ultrasound . 70-million-to-one odds: The couple were delighted to learn their first round of IVF was successful in July following a long battle with infertility. But they were later stunned to discover they were having four babies . Caught on camera: Their incredible reaction to the news was captured in hospital by friend Alicia Hallock . Twin to twin transfusion is caused by an abnormal connecting of blood vessels in the twins’ shared placenta which results in an imbalance of blood flow from one twin to the other. It affects approximately 15% of identical twins who share the same placenta. One twin is often larger than the other twin and receives more blood than usual from the placenta. This can put a strain on the baby’s heart and makes this twin produce more urine than normal, resulting in extra fluid around the baby, within the amniotic sac. This can be uncomfortable for the mother and also increases the risk to the pregnancy by causingpremature labour due to the extra pressure on the neck of the womb (cervix). The other twin is usually smaller and may become anaemic due to receiving less blood from the placenta. The treatments for TTTS pregnancies depend, in part, on when in pregnancy the twins become affected. If the twins are mature enough to survive outside the womb (beyond 25 weeks), immediate delivery is an option for TTTS babies. Fetal laser surgery may be done to stop the flow of blood from one twin to the other. Another treatment is amnioreduction -  a procedure whereby fluid is taken from around the twin with polyhydramnios to try and prevent premature delivery. A needle is passed through the abdomen into the sac of the recipient twin and fluid removed. Source: Liverpool Women's NHS . 'Ashley will be put on bed rest from here on out. They then posted: 'The doctor just came out and said the babies are cured of twin to twin transfusion... he said that part couldn't have gone better!!!' Twin to twin transfusion is caused by an abnormal connecting of blood vessels in the twins’ shared placenta which results in an imbalance of blood flow from one twin to the other. It affects approximately 15% of identical twins who share the same placenta and treatments can include surgery. The couple hit the headlines a few weeks ago when a video of the moment they found out they were having quadruplets after spending eight years trying to conceive went viral. They were delighted to learn their first round of IVF was successful in July following a long battle with infertility. But when they attended their first ultrasound, they were stunned to discover they were expecting four babies - at odds of 70 million to one. Their incredible reaction to the news was captured in hospital by their friend, Alicia Hallock, and later uploaded online. Footage shows the couple gazing open-mouthed at the screen, before Mrs Gardner places her hand on her forehead and breathes out. The pair then start laughing in delight, while the mother-to-be holds up scans of her four babies. Speaking to CNN, Mrs Gardner, who suffers from endometriosis - a condition which sees cells from the lining of the womb grow in other areas of the body - said she was shocked but excited to discover she was pregnant with quadruplets. 'I couldn't think straight. I had never been so excited and terrified in the same instant. We waited so long to have babies so we were so happy,' she said. 'But at that time we literally had never even thought once about this being a possibility. We didn't know anything about having quads and the risks that go with it. But overall, we were just excited.' She added that her doctor 'didn't believe it' when he learned the news from the ultrasound technician - and asked her to come back the following week so he could 'see for himself'. Quadruplets: Mrs Gardner, who suffers from endometriosis - a condition where cells from the lining of the womb grow in other areas of the body - is pictured holding up scans of her four babies, who are all girls . Happy: Before getting pregnant, Mrs Gardner said she had spent eight years trying 'everything' to counter the fertility problems caused by her condition, which can also result in intense pain. Above, the Gardners . Before getting pregnant, Mrs Gardner spent eight years trying 'everything' to counter the fertility problems caused by her condition, which can also result in intense pain. She adopted a specific diet, underwent a laparoscopy, took medication and had four failed rounds of intrauterine insemination, before finally saving up for IVF. 'My endometriosis was so bad that we found during the IVF process that it had compromised my eggs. They all started dying off and left us with one perfect egg and one good egg,' she said. 'They put both back to give me the best odds of one sticking. The chances of even getting one to stick was 40 per cent. To have both stick and both split... well, that's a one-in-70 million chance!' But despite her joy, Mrs Gardner said she is aware of the risks involved in her pregnancy, writing on Facebook: 'I am extremely high risk and things can change at a moments notice for us.'

"A baby-faced teenage gang's reign of terror over a housing estate in Preston is over after they were given ASBOs banning them from meeting up, going to their usual haunts and even swearing. The three boys and two girls brought misery to their neighbourhood with a wave of intimidation and vandalism, causing 'mayhem' and shouting abuse at foreign students living there. The gang - Kian Lowe, 13, his cousins Charlie Blakey, 15, and Ryan Blakey, 16, and their female accomplices Chloe Scott, 15, and Toni O'Sullivan, 15, were all given strict two-year ASBOs at a court hearing yesterday. The gang, including 13-year-old Kian Lowe (pictured), were handed ASBOs stopping them from meeting up and even banning them from swearing, marking an end to their reign of terror over a block of flats in Preston . Charley Blakey, 15 (left) and Ryan Blakey, 16, were said to have kicked in doors and walls, as well as damaging letterboxes at the block of flats . Charlie Blakey posted this picture on his Facebook of £20 notes spelling the word 'mob' and a machete . Toni O'Sullivan (left) and Chloe Scott, both 15, were part of the baby-faced gang which intimidated the residents of Bedford Court, Preston . The group blighted the local community for years with anti-social behaviour, causing thousands of pounds worth of damage to student flats and forcing a local youth club to close. The unruly teenagers boasted of their exploits on Facebook, posting pictures of themselves making gun signals and creating the word: 'Mob' out of £20 notes with a machete underneath. In court, the youngsters, who attended with relatives, made jokes and complained about how long the four-hour hearing was taking. Their application for a blanket ban on naming them on the grounds of 'privacy' was firmly rejected by District Judge Jane Goodwin. Prosecutor Rachel Fung said: 'This is one of the worst cases I have seen in recent years. They caused mayhem.' Judge Goodwin said: 'ASBOs are provided to protect the community and publicity should be expected in most cases. This group of young persons have wreaked havoc on the local community and housing estate for at least two years. She told the baby-faced gang: 'I'm satisfied you have engaged in acts of an anti-social manner which has caused persistent alarm or distress to one or more persons not in your home. I am satisfied it is necessary to issue an ASBO on you with cause to protect people from further acts of anti-social behaviour.' The order bans all five gang members from using foul language in public, as well as stopping them from entering eight different apartment blocks and University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN) buildings where they used to meet up. Threatening: One photo posted online by a member spelled out the word Mob using £20 notes . The group 'wreaked havoc' on innocent housing estate residents, a judge said, leaving people too afraid to leave their homes because of the 'frightening' youths . Scott (pictured) and the unruly teenagers boasted of their exploits on Facebook, posting pictures of themselves making gun signals and creating the word: 'Mob' out of £20 notes with a machete underneath . O'Sullivan and Ryan Blakey (pictured), as well as the other three members of their gang, are now banned from eight different blocks of flats where they used to meet . They also cannot meet each other for any reason - apart from O'Sullivan and Charlie Blakey as they are in a relationship. This morning Tim Saul, 48, the landlord of the flats at Bedford Court, where the gang would intimidate residents, described the damage they caused. 'Most of the people living in the flats are international students coming to the country for the first time and they've been absolutely terrified,' said Mr Saul, who spent £1,110 on CCTV cameras to help police gather evidence against the gang. 'They won't come out off their flats because they are so frightened of these youngsters. These kids were targeting the communal areas, not breaking into the apartments, but generally causing a nuisance and being very destructive. 'They are running up and kicking the doors in and we have had to get security doors that are very expensive, £1,200 to keep them out. Once inside they are damaging things, damaging the mailboxes, ripping them open and removing the mail. 'They have kicked holes in every single wall from the ground floor to the fourth floor, ripped lights off walls. They have been setting alight the carpets with cigarettes.They force open the windows and urinate in lifts. They are drinking and smoking and causing a lot of noise and leaving rubbish. It was on a daily basis but was worse at the weekends.' Ryan Blakey rode his bicycle to the hearing at Preston Magistrates' Court, wearing tracksuit bottoms . Baby-faced: Lowe and the gang 'terrified' international students living in flats near the UCLAN campus . Bedford Court landlord Tim Saul, 48, described the abuse the gang would give his tenants and asked: 'Where are the parents?' He added: 'It's just one group and together they all terrorise the neighbours.  One girl could hear them kicking holes in the walls and she feared they were going to come through into her apartment. If it continues people will no longer want to live here. 'They swear at people. They are abusive to the international students and throw stones at them and cars. Some of it is racist to the Chinese [students]. They seem to have no respect for anyone. 'What I want to know is where are their parents? Why are these young people out at all hours causing misery for everyone?' Sgt Darren Carr, from Lancashire Police, said: 'These individuals have caused a catalogue of problems for local residents for over two years, despite many efforts to address their behaviour. I am delighted that the court has today taken the decision to impose five full ASBOs. 'The problems caused by this group were exasperated when a local youth club was forced to close owing to their bad behaviour, resulting in other youngsters losing out. They targeted multi-occupancy premises and thousands of pounds worth of repairs were required to replace doors to communal buildings and to fix damage caused, resulting in increased maintenance fees for residents. 'Some residents were too scared to leave their home in the evening and many international students at UCLAN felt intimated and were afraid to walk through the area. 'These ASBOs will give us the ability to closely monitor these individuals' activities and hopefully prevent many more people becoming victims. It will also give us the means to get these individuals quickly before a court for any breaches. Sgt Carr added: 'These teenagers are now suffering the consequences of their pack mentality and anti-social behaviour.'","A baby-faced gang of teenagers terrorised a neighbourhood for a year .

"At first glance you could be forgiven for mistaking this picture for the famous oil painting of George Washington crossing the Delaware during the American Revolution. But look a little closer and the bright orange water pistols give the game away. Groom Joe Stack, from Louisville, Kentucky, decided to forgo traditional wedding pictures and pose for scenes that resemble action-packed blockbusters with his best man and ushers. With a little help from Photoshop the groomsmen look as though they have been transported back in time to the American Revolution and onto the sets of Star Wars and The Matrix. Scroll down for video . With a little help from Photoshop the groom Joe Stark and his ushers recreate Washington Crossing the Delaware, an 1851 oil-on-canvas painting by the German American artist Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze .

Mr Stack and his new wife Meredith are film and video-game fanatics and wanted their wedding to reflect their interests and photographer Shane Elliott was only too happy to oblige. 'We had a blast. Shane was rolling with our goofy antics, so it was easy,' said Mr Stack. 'We had no idea Shane was going to 'touch up' the photos afterward, it was a great surprise.' The photographer added small surprises into the images, including a shark in the right hand corner of the George Washington imitation. Two rats are seen fighting in the parking garage in the 'ground punch' photo and a stormtrooper in the Star Wars picture smokes a cigarette while wearing sunglasses. Photographer Shane Elliott used pictures of real rock and gravel to create the 'ground punch' photo and added surprises into each of the pictures . The groomsmen took just a few minutes to pose for the pictures on the wedding day in Louisville, Kentucky – but had no idea what the finished product would look like . Mr Elliot said: 'They were all in a great mood all day. They were a pretty tight group and shared a lot of private jokes and movie references to movies they'd all seen. 'The expressions of the groomsmen in the 'Force choke' pic are priceless.' The three pictures took 20 hours to edit – and Shane even used pictures of real rock and gravel to create the 'ground punch' photo.

"From Himalayan pink salt to quinoa, it seems the trendiest groceries are no longer just for our kitchens but also for our bathrooms, as high-end beauty brands try to convince us that swanky superfoods can benefit us from the outside-in, as well the inside-out. But at such extortionate prices, could you make your own beauty products from these foods — and would they be any good? Using recipes from reputable websites, ANNA PURSGLOVE gave it a go, and asked leading dermatologists Dr Sam Bunting and Dr Stefanie Williams for their verdicts . . . Scroll down for video . Anna Pursglove finds out if you can make your own beauty products from these foods — and whether they would be any good . HIMALAYAN PINK SALT . Beloved by celebrity chefs such as Jamie Oliver, pink salt is mined in Pakistan and its pink colour comes from iron oxide. Now, fashionable brands such as Milanese company Pupa are using it in their body scrubs, with devotees claiming it stimulates circulation, reduces inflammation and can help with bloating. But could I get the same results for less than the £42 it would cost me to buy Pupa’s Reshaping Salt Scrub? Recipe: For a Himalayan pink salt scrub, mix two parts Himalayan pink salt (around £4 for 500g from healthfood stores), one part almond oil (around £5 for 200ml from healthfood stores), lemon zest and fresh thyme leaves. Verdict: This scrub left my skin feeling fresh, stimulated and nicely moisturised. My friends will know what to expect for Christmas! Dr Williams says: ‘There is no scientific evidence that using pink salt topically can achieve any kind of “detox” for your skin. Mixed with oil and used as a scrub, it will exfoliate — but I wouldn’t anticipate any benefits other than that.’ QUINOA . Anna tries an orange moisturising face mask with quinoa which is hailed as a supergrain, buttechnically a seed . Hailed as a supergrain, quinoa is technically a seed. It comes in three forms — red, white and black — and is high in protein, a source of zinc, magnesium, manganese and iron, and free of gluten (so it’s good for coeliacs). Now, it has popped up in a moisturiser by British brand Cowshed. Their Quinoa Hydrating Daily Moisturiser costs £32 and claims to be packed with vitamins and minerals to hydrate your skin. I decided to try out a quinoa face mask. Recipe: Combine a handful of quinoa (around £2 for 300g from supermarkets) with the juice of an orange, three tablespoons of natural yoghurt and two tablespoons of honey. Stir until blended and thick enough to apply to your face. Leave for 15 minutes, then rinse with warm water. Verdict: Disaster! Use too much yoghurt and the stuff runs off your face, but use too little and the quinoa soaks up the yoghurt, leaving the consistency of concrete. By the time I’d got the stuff to stick to my face, I had clumps of quinoa up my nose and a kitchen and bathroom that looked as though they’d been pebble-dashed! Dr Bunting says: ‘While you might get minimal exfoliating effect from rubbing quinoa against your skin, I have not seen any data that shows your skin would receive significant benefit from applying quinoa in a homemade preparation.’ AVOCADO . Full of healthy fats and potassium, avocado isn’t the newest of health foods, but it’s a firm favourite. Due to its high oleic acid content (a fatty acid said to make hair thicker and shinier) it’s found in many conditioning hair products by brands such as Tresemme and Pantene, as well as in Kiehl’s Olive & Avocado Leave-In Oil-In-Cream, £19. DIY beauty fans recommend avocado treatments for dry, brittle hair because of its high vitamin and oil content. Recipe: For an avocado hair conditioner, mix one avocado (around £1), two tablespoons of honey and a tablespoon of avocado oil (around £5 for 250ml) in a blender until smooth. Wet hair and apply mixture. Cover with a plastic cap and leave for 20 minutes. Rinse thoroughly. Avocado hair conditioner was one of the more successful homemade recipes that Anna tried . Verdict: Despite only using a small amount, my hair felt very nice and soft afterwards. Given the amount I’ve spent on conditioner over the years, I’d definitely try this again. Dr Williams says: ‘Avocado is a skin-friendly food, as it contains lots of mono-unsaturated fat, as well as vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. But whether these would penetrate skin when applied topically is a different question. ‘It may have some benefit in making the hair shaft smoother, but this will be a temporary benefit, as there is no scientific evidence it does anything for scalp health.’ Anna gives coconut deodorant a go . COCONUT OIL . The world has gone coconut oil crazy, with cooks switching butter or extra virgin oil for the super-oil that is said to boost cholesterol and have antibacterial properties. Fans say it can also be used as anything from mouthwash to moisturiser and one brand, Luxe Paris, has even created a coconut deodorant for £8.50. Recipe: To make your own coconut oil deodorant, mix four tablespoons each of baking soda and arrowroot, then use a fork to mash in six teaspoons of coconut oil (around £2 for 500ml at supermarkets and healthfood stores), which is solid at room temperature. A few drops of essential oil will add scent. Mould into an empty deodorant stick, if you have one, or a shot glass works just as well. If the homemade stick gets floppy and difficult to work with, add a little more of the powdered ingredients. Verdict: Although this is a natural deodorant, it is not an antiperspirant (to prevent wetness), so if sweating is an issue, this won’t suit. Nevertheless, this worked better than I expected. I wore it out running, and found I didn’t smell afterwards. It also softened my underarm skin. Dr Williams says: ‘Coconut oil does have anti-inflammatory properties when used on skin, so it can protect, soothe, hydrate and strengthen the skin’s barrier function.’ Visit drsambunting.com and eudelo.com .","From coconut oil to quinoa and avocados, superfoods aren't just for eating .

"A blood test being developed by a group of Australian scientists could predict Alzheimer's disease two decades before patients show signs of the illness. University of Melbourne researchers, who discovered the test, previously helped identify changes in the brain happened 20 years before people started presenting symptoms of the disease, which can be detected by performing brain-imaging procedures. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia with sufferers having deteriorating memory loss which gets worse over time as well as affecting their behaviour. Scroll down for video . University of Melbourne researchers are on the cusp of developing a blood test that could detect Alzheimer's disease . The blood test would have a 91 per cent rate of accuracy in predicting Alzheimer's and could be available within five years as further testing is yet to be carried out. Initial research carried out on a trial group resulted in one of five participants  positive for the disease despite having no memory loss. Further tests carried out using brain-imaging procedures showed these patients had signs of degeneration associated with Alzheimer's. The research was carried out by the university's Department of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology Bio21 Institute. Researcher Dr Lesley Cheng (right) said the test (left) had the potential to predict Alzheimer's up to 20 years before sufferers showed signs of the disease . Research was carried out on a trial group where one of five participants tested positive for the disease despite having no memory loss . The department's Dr Lesley Cheng said the test had the potential to predict Alzheimer's up to 20 years before sufferers showed signs of the disease. She told Daily Mail Australia that the data available from their research could only provide a five-year detection as it had only been going for seven years, but with more participants they would be able to match up brain-imaging techniques with blood tests to track how far back it could predict. 'We wanted to develop a blood test to be used as a pre-screen to identify [patients] who needed a brain scan and those it was unnecessary to do a brain scan,' Dr Cheng said. Dr  Cheng said it would also provide a more accessible method for people to accurately find out how likely they were to get the disease. Dr Lesley Cheng - who is part of the team - said the test had the potential to predict Alzheimer's up to 20 years before sufferers showed signs of the disease . 'This test provides the possibility of early detection of AD by using a simple blood test which has been designed to also be cost-effective,' she said. 'Furthermore, it is highly accessible for patients and physicians compared to organising a brain scan or undergoing a neuropsychological test. 'Patients with a family history of AD or those with memory concerns could be tested during a standard health check at a medical clinic. 'This test could ease concerns for patients experiencing normal memory problems due to natural ageing. Those identified as high risk could then be monitored by their doctor.' The University of Melbourne findings were published in science journal Molecular Psychiatry in collaboration with The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, the CSIRO, Austin Health and Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing.","Ongoing research is being carried out by the University of Melbourne .

"A surly David James refused an interview when he was approached at his hotel in Cochin, south India, where he is player-manager for the Kerala Blasters in the new Indian Super League. Team sources later claimed James was too tired to talk, but the Blasters dressing-room are also aware that all is not well back in the UK following his decision to auction his belongings on the web. The former England goalkeeper has been forced into auctioning signed shirts, shorts and match balls after being declared bankrupt in May. James is also selling more unusual items such as a van, a chopper bicycle and a jubilee mug to raise cash. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David James in action for Kerala Blasters . David James has extended his playing career by signing for Kerala Blasters in the Indian Super League . The former Liverpool, Manchester City, West Ham and Portsmouth goalkeeper was also England's No 1 . James has built up crippling debts after breaking up with his wife Tanya in 2005 and is said to have blown his £20million fortune which came from his football wages, endorsements and modelling contracts for companies such as Armani. The 44-year-old played in the Premier League for teams such as Liverpool, Manchester City and Portsmouth and has recently came out of retirement to become a player-manager with the Blasters. Until the revelations, no-one inside the James circle was aware of the desperate financial situation that forced him to Hertford County Court. A selection of the items that James has been forced to auction after being declared bankrupt . CLICK HERE to read more about the former England goalkeeper's bankruptcy problems. James’s mood picked up a little on Thursday evening, when his team beat local rivals FC Goa 1-0 in front of 47,000 fans at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Cochin. That lifted them up to fifth in the eight-team league after a difficult start to the season, though the atmosphere at the game was better than the football. After a stint in Iceland, James is trying to forge a new career in another unlikely setting. The surreal nature of his Indian odyssey is underlined by the fact that the club’s co-owner is former cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who drew cheers louder than anything the footballers could attract whenever he appeared on the big screen during Thursday’s game. James helped the Blasters to a victory over Goa in the ISL despite his personal issues . Arsenal hero Robert Pires (front left) played against James for Goa in the clash . Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, India's most popular sportsman, is co-owner of the Blasters . In one of the few parts of India where football can even begin to rival cricket, the pressure is on James to live up to his status as the Blasters’ ‘marquee’ player. Billboards in and out of Cochin proclaim ‘God’s Own Team’ and ‘Football’s Own Country’, and he elicited a cheer every time he touched the ball against Goa. But he also showed signs of impatience with aspects of his team’s defending, flapping his hands in frustration on several occasions when his colleagues failed to deal with a free-kick or a corner. The final whistle brought relief, and hugs all round, but the expectations are not going away: Kerala Blasters host Delhi Dynamos on Sunday knowing that their passionate fans will be clamouring for another win.","Former England goalkeeper David James was declared bankrupt in May .

"A primary school teacher accused of restraining a pupil for five minutes by covering him with a giant beanbag and sitting on top of it has been cleared of misconduct. Philip Meredith, 44, was said to have trapped the youngster under a beanbag the size of a double bed at Ty Sign Primary School in Risca, Wales, while the pupil shouted ‘get off, get off’, a professional conduct committee hearing was told. Speaking after the hearing's conclusion today, the father-of-two said he was 'absolutely delighted' with the result as 'the past three years have been like a living hell'. Philip Meredith (pictured) has been cleared of misconduct after being accused of restraining a pupil for five minutes - by covering him with a giant beanbag and sitting on top of it . Ellen Sheldon, a teaching assistant working in Mr Meredith’s classroom at the time of the alleged incident, told the hearing how she could see the child – named only as ‘Pupil A’ - ‘kicking’ as he tried to free himself. She reported the incident - which allegedly happened on November 17, 2011 - and the following month Mr Meredith was suspended. He was later dismissed. Appearing before a General Teaching Council for Wales (GTCW) professional conduct committee in Cardiff, Mr Meredith denied the accusation and was today cleared of eight charges of misconduct. He also denied bullying and rough-handling other pupils - allegations brought forward by teaching assistants at the primary school. It was alleged that he shouted at Pupil A and spoke 'overly loudly' to him, when it was not necessary or appropriate to do so. He denied the claim but admitted he has a 'naturally loud voice'. After being cleared of eight charges of misconduct while teaching at Ty Sign Primary School in Risca, Wales (above), Mr Meredith said: 'The past three years have been like a living hell' It was also alleged that he held a second child - Pupil B - by the front of his shirt and held him on the floor with his face against the carpet. Speaking during the hearing, Mr Meredith said: 'I recognise that all these allegations are very, very serious and I also recognise that I did not do them.' Teaching assistant Ellen Sheldon had told the hearing that she saw the beanbag incident saying: 'There was a fight and Pupil A was put in a restraint by Mr Meredith. 'I didn't see how he got under the bag. I could see his feet kicking and he was shouting 'get off, get off'. ‘I would estimate he was under the bean bag for four to five minutes.’ Sobbing throughout her evidence she told the panel: ‘I’ve never had to deal with anything like this on my life and I never want to deal with it again. It’s made me feel ill.’ After clearing the teacher of all charges, hearing chairman Gareth Roberts said: 'The facts have not been proven on the balance of probabilities.' Mr Meredith, from Merthyr Tydfil, said afterwards: 'I'm absolutely delighted and relieved to have been fully vindicated of all the unfair allegations against me. 'The past three years have been like a living hell where I have been kept from a career which has been my life. I sincerely hope now to be able to return to teaching.'","Philip Meredith was sacked from Ty Sign Primary School in Risca, Wales .

"Red Bull customers who expected to get a $10 refund from Red Bull because they didn't automatically grow wings will be getting something more like $3 or less after the company's site crashed from having too many visitors. Energy drink Red Bull GmbH settled two class-action lawsuits this week, agreeing to pay $13million because their famous slogan 'Red Bull gives you wings' isn't true. It was originally reported that anyone who bought a drink from January 1, 2002 to October 3, 2014 would be eligible to receive either a $10 cash payment of $15 in Red Bull product -regardless of whether there was a receipt for proof as long as they applied online before March 2 2015. Scroll down for video . Pay up: Red Bull settled two class-action lawsuit this week, agreeing to pay $13million for false advertising . The Drum reports that the site was was visited 4.6 million times in the last 24 hours and that many of the claims are most likely fraudulent. Due to the mass amount of claims the settlement is likely to offer applicants just $3. Even though the amount is small, claimants are likely to get the money in as soon as 150 days. According to the terms of the lawsuit, the company agreed to pay customers up to $13million, not $10 in cash to anyone who filed a claim by the deadline . Flase claims: Above, grabs from a 2000 advertisement for Red Bull in which it claims to give drinkers 'wiiings' The offer only applies to customers in the U.S. In one of the lawsuits, a consumer who had been drinking the product for years wrote that they had experienced no increase in performance, concentration of reaction speed. 'Such deceptive conduct and practices mean that [Red Bull's] advertising and marketing is not just ""puffery,"" but is instead deceptive and fraudulent and is therefore actionable,' the suit says. 'Even though there is a lack of genuine scientific support for a claim that Red Bull branded energy drinks provide any more benefit to a consumer than a cup of coffee, the Red Bull defendants persistently and pervasively market their product as a superior source of ""energy"" worthy of a premium price over a cup of coffee or other sources of caffeine,' the suit says . Red Bull has agreed to change their marketing campaign, but insists their advertising was never misleading to begin with. 'Red Bull settled the lawsuit to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation. However, Red Bull maintains that its marketing and labeling have always been truthful and accurate, and denies any and all wrongdoing or liability,' the company said in a statement. The settlement could be approved by May with payments being sent out withing 150 days of the final approval.","The Red Bull site was visited 4.6 million times in the last 24 hours and that many of the claims are most likely fraudulent .

"A controversial new video featuring five young girls dropping the F-word numerous times is hoping to shock people into learning about inequality between women and men. The clip, which is called 'Things More Offensive Than The Word F***' lists a number of issues which are still keeping women and girls as the second-class sex. It has already had more than seven million views worldwide. The little American actresses turn the air blue with their language, while also pointing out several shocking statistics on pay inequality, rape and violence and body issues. Scroll down for video . A hilarious new video that featuring five young girls dropping the F-word numerous times is hoping to shock people into learning about inequality between women and men . They then ask which is more offensive - the fact that they are swearing, or the facts that they are presenting you with. Each line of dialogue is expressed by a different girl, who are all dressed as Disney-style princesses, as they try to turn the “princess in distress” stereotype on its head. The video opens as it aims to go on - with a swear word seven seconds in. The MailOnline has bleeped out any of the words but has kept the rest of the video intact. The girls say: 'Pretty, pretty, What the f***? I’m not the pretty f***ing hopeless princess in distress . 'I’m pretty f***ing powerful and ready for success. 'What is more offensive - a little girl saying f*** or the f***ing unequal and sexist way society treats girls and women?' They continue: 'It’s our future, so listen up grown-ups. 'Here’s some words more offensive than the word f***.' The first issue that the girls tackle is pay inequality, stating several eye-opening statistics about how unequal it is for women in the workplace. The girls say: 'Women are paid 22 per cent less than men for the exact same f***ing work. 'And women who graduate university with straight A’s get paid as much as men who only got C’s. 'So bad grades equal more bank, just because you’re a boy? 'Hell no mother f***er. I shouldn’t need a penis to get paid.' The girls in the video ask which is more offensive - the fact that they are swearing, or the inequality facts that they are presenting you with . They then move on to the topic of rape and violence against women and girls, opening with the figure: 'One out of every five women will be sexually assaulted or raped by a man.' The girls then count that there are five of them in the video and ask, 'which one of us will it be?' They continue: 'So how many more women have to get knocked down before society stands up and stops it? 'Stop telling girls how to dress and start telling boys not to f***ing rape. 'Equality’s next step is walking to the car without fear.' The girls then finish on the issue of looks and 'prettiness.' They say: 'Here’s the tricky thing, 'pretty' is a compliment, but here’s how this focus works to girls’ detriment. The girls address a range of issues including pay inequality, rape, violence and body issues . 'Society teaching girls that our bodies, boobs and butts are more important than our brains, leads us to thinking that our worth comes from our waistline. 'My ass-pirations in life should not be worrying about the shape of my ass. 'So f*** focusing on how I look and give me a book.' The video's producer Mike Kon acknowledges that some adults might be uncomfortable with what they see in the video, but insists that it is for a good cause. He said:'It is shocking what they are saying, but the real shock is that women are still paid less than men for the same work in 2014, not the use of the F-word.' Each line of dialogue is expressed by a different girl,who are all dressed as Disney-style princesses, as they try to turn the “princess in distress” stereotype on its head . The girls are given witty but shocking one-liners that include: 'F*** focusing on how I look and give me a book' Mike continued: 'The big statistic that one out of five women are sexually assaulted or raped is something society seems to find less offensive than a little four letter word and we love how these girls draw attention to that imbalance.' He added: 'Instead of washing these girls’ mouths out with soap, maybe society needs to clean up its act.' The video is part of the American FCKH8.com T-shirt company’s charity T-shirt fundraising effort. The group’s website is making the tops available starting at $15 (£9.30), with $5 (£3.12) from each T-shirt sold going towards five anti-sexism organisations and projects.

"Mohammed Asghar, who has been sentenced to death in Pakistan after being accused of writing letters claiming to be the Prophet Mohammed . The family of British man who has been jailed in Pakistan for blasphemy has begged David Cameron to help save him. Mohammed Asghar from Edinburgh was sentenced to death in January after being accused of writing letters to a number of people claiming to be the Prophet Mohammed. The 70-year-old, who is mentally ill, is said to have donated thousands of pounds towards education in his native Pakistan, helping to build an orphanage and school. The grandfather is currently in hospital after being shot by a prison guard at Adiala prison in Rawalpindi on Thursday morning. Now his son Tony has called on the Prime Minister to help release his father, who he said is being targeted for his wealth. He also added that he has also been warned to stay away from the jail as he too would be shot. Mr Asghar, 41, told the Independent: 'It’s all about money. That’s why my father is in prison. 'I have had phone calls from there not to go and see him because there is a bullet with my name on it. 'My father is a very, very wealthy man over there he has property and everything. I have full power of attorney over his estate and that’s why no one wants me to go over there.' Yesterday, Mr Asghar's family spoke at a press conference in Glasgow where they told of how he has a long history of mental illness and needs specialist care, which he is not receiving in jail. They have also urged Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond to intervene so he can be transferred back to the UK for treatment. Family solicitor Aamer Anwar said: 'To date the British government has failed to provide any meaningful assistance to Mr Asghar or his family. It is now too late to wait for discussions behind closed doors and other delaying tactics. 'The next 48 hours will be critical for Mr Asghar's personal safety.' Mr Asghar was arrested in 2010 in Rawalpindi after a blasphemy complaint was brought against him by a tenant with whom he was having a dispute. He had previously been diagnosed as suffering from severe paranoid schizophrenia but this was not taken into account by the authorities during his trial, Mr Anwar said. He said prison doctors have failed to acknowledge the severity of his psychiatric illness and he has been given only the most basic antidepressant medication. Mr Asghar's son Tony, left has appealed for David Cameron to help bring his father back to the UK. He spoke at a press conference yesterday alongside his sister Jasmina Rana, right . A Foreign Office spokesman said last night: 'We are deeply concerned about the case of Mr Asghar, who was injured while in prison in Pakistan. 'Consular officials continue to monitor his situation and are liaising with the hospital and prison authorities. 'We have raised our concerns about his safety and welfare at senior levels to ensure that he is receiving the best possible support and that there is an urgent investigation into what happened. 'We have previously raised our concerns about his wider case, including through the former foreign secretary, and will continue to do so. The Foreign Office say they are in regular contact with Mr Ashghar's famiy and added they are deeply concerned by the case . 'It is crucial that concerns about Mr Asghar's safety and mental health are addressed and also taken into consideration during his appeal. 'We are in regular contact with family members in the UK and Pakistan. 'The Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, has also spoken to Mr Asghar's daughter and expressed our concerns at his situation and the distress that this is causing his family.' Retired grocery shop owner Mohammed Asghar was a well-known member of Edinburgh's Muslim community and worshiped at the Shah Jalal Mosque and Islamic Centre in the city. He was born in Pakistan but came to the UK aged 15 and worked in a factory in Birmingham. Mr Asghar worked himself up before moving to Edinburgh, where he married and opened a number of grocery shops in Leith. In 2000 he suffered a stroke before being diagnosed with his mental illness. Scores of people have been arrested in Pakistan under the country's harsh blasphemy laws, which carry sentences of life in prison or the death penalty. Rights groups say the laws often are exploited for personal gain and that members of Pakistan's minority population are disproportionately targeted. People accused of blasphemy also have been attacked and killed by angry vigilante mobs. The charges are also hard to fight because the law does not define what is blasphemous and presenting the evidence can sometimes itself be considered a fresh infringement. Few leaders in the predominantly Muslim country have shown willingness to tackle the contentious issue, especially after two prominent politicians who criticised the blasphemy law were murdered in recent years.","Mohammed Asghar was sentenced to death in Pakistan for blasphemy .

"A New York investment banker has been charged with 'physical and psychological abuse' that includes bizarre sex acts against his French ex-wife. Miryam Allam, 31, claims she was subject to years of violence, including being forced into sex against her will and being burnt by a cigar. Ms Allam is seeking unspecified damages from her high-rolling ex-husband, who she claims called her a 'bitch' and 'ejaculated on her face' when she refused to call him the 'most powerful man in the world'. Claims: Miryam Allam ,right, is seeking unspecified damages from her high-rolling ex-husband, Jason Myers, who she claims called her a 'bitch' and 'ejaculated on her face' when she refused to call him the 'most powerful man in the world' 'Husband from hell', financier Jason Myers, 44, is accused of assault, battery, false imprisonment and causing emotional distress. The French native also claims Meyers, who called himself 'Prince Charming', tried to get her kicked out of the country. Once, after she was slapped in the face and had her hair pulled in public, Meyers admitted to Ms Allam 'that seeing her upset turned him on', reports the New York Daily News. The couple is believed to have met in . Geneva in 2007, when Ms Allam was working as an assistant at Meyers' private equity firm Aspatuck Holdings, which is based in Manhattan. Allegations: Ms Allam claims five months after they began dating, Meyers slapped her after she complained they didn't spend enough time together . Meyers - who already had an ex-wife, Natasha Meyers, a divorce lawyer - wooed Ms Allam with lavish holidays and romantic dinners, reports the New York Daily News. But the fairytale relationship soon came to an end. Five months after they began dating, Meyers slapped Ms Allam after she complained they didn't spend enough time together, she claims. She alleges what then emerged was a pattern of abuse: physical and emotional violence followed by repeated apologies and gifts. Ms Allam says she was given a daily allowance of $10 to $20 by Meyers, who is the CEO of the Aspatuck Holdings and TriMedia Entertainment Group. She claims she was also prevented . from speaking to her family and friends and was beaten and called a . 'prostitute' for wearing make-up he didn't like. Once . she found a photograph of Meyers and his first wife who 'was wearing a . very short black leather dress and holding a whip, and Jason had a mask . with metal chains around his body', according to the report. Executive: Meyers is CEO of the Aspatuck Holdings private-equity firm . Ms Allam says she was attacked after confronting Meyers with the image, who then 'slapped her and ordered her never to touch it again'. When Ms Allam fell pregnant in June 2009, she did not leave her then boyfriend despite her reports of his increasingly disturbed behaviour. The couple married in a ceremony at New York's City Hall on October 2, after he proposed at the Boathouse in Central Park. Ms Allam stated that she stayed with Meyers because she thought he would see the error of his ways. 'I trusted him and I loved him and I kept thinking things would change,' she said. But just two weeks after the wedding, Meyers was arrested for cutting Ms Allam's face with glass at his house in Huntington, Long Island. Ms Allam says that when she once asked her then husband why he treated her badly, his response was as cruel as the violence he dealt out. 'Don't act like a dog if you don't want to be treated like a dog', she claims he said. Meyers' attorney, Steven Altman, told the jury at the trial that Ms Allam 'frequently was drunk, out with other men and flaunting it in [Meyers'] face'. The couple divorced on October 18 2009, fifteen days after they wed.","Miryam Allam is seeking unspecified damages from her high-rolling ex-husband Jason Myers, claiming she was subject to years of violence ."
"Following the release of Apple’s latest handsets, a wave of people flocked to sell their old models in order to get their hands on the new ones, on sites such as eBay and Craigslist. But buying second-hand devices in this way can be risky, especially if you’re unsure if the handset on offer has been stolen or not. Apple has released a tool that now lets potential buyers check to see if the Activation Lock on the handset is switched on, and whether the device needs a password to use. Apple's online tool (pictured) lets buyers check the status of a second-hand device. If Activation Lock is enabled, it means the handset is locked and needs a password to access. This suggests the owner of the phone has not removed these security steps, which in turn suggests the seller may not be the legal owner . If an Activation Lock is enabled, it suggests the owner of the phone has not removed the security steps needed to access the device. It would, therefore, be unusual for a person selling the handset to leave it locked and protected – meaning there is a chance it is stolen, or doesn’t belong to the person selling it. Activation Lock was added to Apple's Find My iPhone feature in iOS 7. It is designed to prevent anyone else, other than the owner, from using an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch if it is lost or stolen. The feature is automatically enabled when Find My iPhone is switched on. To access a phone with Activation Lock enabled, users will need a password and the connected Apple ID. To enable Find My iPhone, go to Settings, iCloud, sign in with an Apple ID and select Turn on Find My iPhone. If the Activation Lock is switched off, buyers can assume that the device is being sold legally. Or, at the very least, it has been wiped and the previous owner's details removed. To check a phone’s status, buyers enter the IMEI or serial number of the handset into the online tool. These numbers are listed in the phone’s Settings menu, by clicking General and About. If the phone is being sold online, and the buyer can’t see it before purchasing it, they should ask the seller for the number. Alternatively, the seller can perform the check and provide proof about the phone’s status, before agreeing a sale. There have been reports recently of hackers being able to bypass the activation lock, to make the phone appear to be unlocked. But Apple’s tool will reveal if the lock is still enabled. Apple advises users: ‘If you received this device from someone else, contact the previous owner and ask them to erase the device and remove it from their account. To check a phone’s status, buyers enter the IMEI or serial number of the handset into the online tool. The status of the device, including the make and model is shown. This can also reveal if the IMEI is a fake . If the phone is being sold online, (example listing pictured) and the buyer can’t see it before purchasing it, they should ask the seller for the number.

"Katy Perry and John Mayer have broken up, according to reports. The 29-year-old singer is understood to have called time on her relationship with her 36-year-old beau in the 'last few days'. E! News quoted a source as telling them that the pair's romance has come to an end, but said no other details have been revealed.

Come to an end? Katy Perry and John Mayer are reported to have split . E! also noted that John was noticeably absent from Katy's recent trips to London, where she performed at the BRIT Awards, and Milan.

"A New York man has pleaded guilty to beating his girlfriend's godson to death. Jonathan Thompson, of Amityville, New York, punched 4-year-old Adonis Reed so hard in the stomach when the boy refused to take a nap that the youngster died as the result of a lacerated liver. At the time, Reed was living with his godmother, Lakisha Pitt, who was dating Thompson. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Jonathan Thompson (left) has pleaded guilty to second degree murder after beating Adonis Reed (right) to death . Gone too soon: Reed (above with an unidentified relative) was living with his godmother Lakisha Pitt at the time of his death, who was dating Thompson . The boy's 6-year-old sister was also living at the house. Thompson, 34, had confessed to the killing just days after it happened in January of 2013, but in an odd twist was recently suing his former lawyer, and almost every agency connected with the case, claiming a 'clear conspiracy' by all to violate his rights. In addition to a stay of his trial he was also asking for $500 million. According to Newsday, the suit also claimed that Reed died not because of the beating he suffered at the hands of Thompson, but rather from 'overzealous resuscitation efforts by first responders and medical malpractice at Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip.' Beaten to death: Reed was just 4-years-old when he died after suffering fatal injuries to his liver . Anger: Reed's mother Linda Daniel is upset Child Protective Services placed the boy with his godmother since Thompson, who also lived at the house, was a convicted felon . Representing himself, Thompson decided to plead guilty yesterday, just one day before jury selection was set to begin. He likely changed his mind after medical evidence strongly suggested that the beating caused the death, as opposed to any problems with Reed's medical care. Suffolk County Court Judge Barbara Kahn agreed to sentence Thompson to 15 years to life in prison. The young boy's grandmother, Linda Daniels, said she was happy Thompson pleaded guilty yesterday, but felt his sentence was too lenient. She was also upset that Suffolk Child Protective Services placed Reed in his godmother's care to begin with and did not do a background check on her felon boyfriend.","Jonathan Thompson of Amityville, New York, pleaded guilty to beating 4-year-old Adonis Reed to death in January of 2013 .

"Icon: Ben C Bradlee, under whom the Washington Post rose to prominence, died Tuesday of natural causes at his home . The legendary former editor of the Washington Post who led the paper's coverage of the Watergate scandal and made the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers is dead at 93. Ben C Bradlee, who transformed the Post into a venerated institution during his 26 years as its executive editor, passed away in his home in Washington Tuesday night after his health declined due to Alzheimer's disease. Mr Bradlee joined the Post as managing editor in 1965 before becoming executive editor in 1968, bringing with him a vision that elevated the city paper to one of the top news outlets in the nation. The Washington Post would earn national acclaim - including more than a dozen Pulizer Prizes - and draw the ire of government officials for several stories pursued by the paper under Mr Bradlee. The Post broke the first news in 1972 of the Watergate scandal which would eventually take down President Nixon. Mr Bradlee also oversaw the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers, along with the New York Times, which revealed the extent of US military involvement in Vietnam. 'Ben Bradlee was the best American newspaper editor of his time and had the greatest impact on his newspaper of any modern editor,' said Donald E Graham, who succeeded his mother Katharine as publisher of the Washington Post. President Barack Obama, who awarded the editor with the Presidential Medal of Freedom last year, issued a statement saying: 'For Benjamin Bradlee, journalism was more than a profession – it was a public good vital to our democracy. Scroll down for video . Vindicated: Mr Bradlee, with Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, reads the 6-3 Supreme Court decision allowing the Post to continue publishing stories on the Pentagon Papers . Honors: President Barack Obama bestowed Mr Bradlee with the Medal of Freedom in 2013 for his impact on journalism . All the Post's men: Bradlee (center) is pictured here with his two Watergate reporters - Carl Bernstein (left) and Bob Woodward (right) 'A true newspaperman, he transformed the Washington Post into one of the country’s finest newspapers, and with him at the helm, a growing army of reporters published the Pentagon Papers, exposed Watergate, and told stories that needed to be told – stories that helped us understand our world and one another a little bit better.' During Mr Bradlee's tenure, the paper became known for combining in-depth reported stories with magazine-style features, reports the Washington Post in its obituary. The paper's distribution almost doubled during his years and it aggressively expanded national coverage by establishing bureaus across the country and sending correspondents around the world. President Barack Obama: 'For Benjamin Bradlee, journalism was more than a profession – it was a public good vital to our democracy. A true newspaperman, he transformed the Washington Post into one of the country’s finest newspapers, and with him at the helm, a growing army of reporters published the Pentagon Papers, exposed Watergate, and told stories that needed to be told – stories that helped us understand our world and one another a little bit better.' David Remnick, New Yorker editor: 'In my experience, he was the most alive presence, not only in journalism but in any realm. He wasn’t the most powerful intellectual, or the most radical thinker or the most self-questioning, but the most alive. And that was the most important part of why you wanted to please him and bring the story home.' Jill Abramson, former New York Times editor: 'Ben had total joie de journalism. It oozed from every pore. No one had more fun chasing a big story and no editor made the chase more fun.' Star Jones, TV host: 'Sad one of last true #journalism giants passed today. #RIP' Sally Jenkins, Washington Post columnist: 'The Washington Post hired me at 23. ""You're very young,"" Ben Bradlee said. ""But how smart will I look when you turn out well?""' Before him, the Post had  been recognized for four Pulitzers, and only one of them for its reporting. By the time of his retirement in 1991, the paper had earned 18, winning the award for meritorious public service for its coverage of Watergate. He was played by Academy Award-winner Jason Robards in the movie  'All the President's Men' that depicted how he guided Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's reporting on the scandal. Mr Bradlee told the Academy of Achievement in 1988 he had a notion around the first or second day of the scandal of how big the story would become. 'It was strange. You had a lot of Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at two in the morning.' 'What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing?' Mr Bradlee was one of only a handful of people in the world who knew the identity of 'Deep Throat,' an invaluable source for lead reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, at the time of Nixon's resignation. In 2005, shortly after former FBI associate director Mark Felt came forward as the source, Mr Bradlee told PBS in an interview he knew his young reporters were right about Watergate, 'Because nobody told me they were wrong and nobody could prove they were wrong; they weren’t wrong.' 'Ben was a true friend and genius leader in journalism. He forever altered our business. His one unbending principle was the quest for the truth and the necessity of that pursuit,' read a statement from Woodward and Bernstein. A decision made a year before Watergate led to a monumental decision in favor of press freedom in the US. Ben Bradlee, with Katharine Graham, who was then publisher of the Washington Post, gave the go-ahead to publish articles using information from the Pentagon Papers. Rebel: Mr Bradlee served as press attache for the American embassy in Paris and was almost expelled after trying to get an interview with Algerian rebel leaders . Early start: Mr Bradlee met Senator John F Kennedy while at Newsweek in Washington and formed a strong relationship with him and Jackie . On a court order requested by the Nixon administration, the New York Times had already been stopped from publishing the classified study of the Vietnam War leaked by Daniel Ellsberg. The Washington Post began running and would also be ordered to cease publication of stories related to the Pentagon Papers but refused. A 6-3 decision from the Supreme Court upheld protections for freedom of the press and allowed both papers to continue publishing. Even his Style section had bite. Introduced in 1969, the feature section went after the powerful in all sectors, from glamour to government, and did it brazenly with narrative flair. It wasn't all glory for the Washington Post under Mr Bradlee. The paper endured the embarrassment of being found to have published a fabricated story about an eight-year-old heroin addict. Bradlee was played by Academy Award winning actor Jason Robards (right) in the film 'All the President's Men' that depicted Post's coverage of Watergate . Trendsetter: Mr Bradlee and Mrs Graham together leaving the US District Court in Washington. Mr Bradlee was on the cutting edge of news innovation and was known for his sharp sense of style . What made the paper's black eye worse was that Woodward, then assistant managing editor, had submitted the story for the Pulitzer Prize in 1981, and a public fallout resulted when it was returned. Mr Bradlee himself thought critical recognition for his paper's success was meaningless. He wrote in his memoir, 'Bet me that when I die, there will be something in my obit about how The Washington Post ""won"" 18 Pulitzer prizes while Bradlee was editor.' Instead, Mr Bradlee believed it was his reporters that were behind every great story, and pushed them to deliver. He 'set the ground rules,' wrote Graham, who died in 2001. 'Pushing, pushing, pushing, not so subtly asking everyone to take one more step, relentlessly pursuing the story in the face of persistent accusations against us and a concerted campaign of intimidation.' Mr Bradlee was born in Boston in 1921. He attended Harvard, but graduated early and enlisted in the US Navy in 1942. He was stationed out at sea for four years during World War II, and later remembered his Navy years with pride, having served in several battles in the Pacific theater. Bradlee, pictured here in 1970 (right) with Post staffer Richard Harwood, said told Post publisher Katharine Graham he'd 'give his left one' for a shot at the newspaper's top job . He co-founded a newspaper in New Hampshire where he worked as a reporter on his return. From there he served briefly as the press attache to the American embassy in Paris, before working as Newsweek's Paris correspondent. After returning from Paris, he befriended Senator John F Kennedy, who had a home near Mr Bradlee's in Washington. When asked by Katharine Graham, who had just taken over as publisher of the Post, about the managing editor position, Bradlee reportedly said, 'I'd give my left one for it.' He married three times over his life and had four children. His son, Ben Bradlee Jr is a former deputy managing editor at the Boston Globe. Last month, his wife Sally Quinn, herself a reporter at the Washington Post, told C-Span that his health had deteriorated after years of living with Alzheimer's, to the point that he was now in hospice care at their home.","Transformed the Washington Post into a major national newspaper with an international reputation .

"In the Bible, Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. In Alabama, it appears to have happened again. Twice. Despite two euthanasia attempts, this four-year-old mixed-breed dog has refused to die. Survivor: Lazarus, four, was given two doses of the lethal injection but was found alive and eating his food . Attempts: Ozark City Animal Shelter in Alabama signed this document to have him put down on September 10 . He even survived a car accident that vets said should have killed him. A rescue organization then decided it had no option but to find him a home - and rename the indestructible canine 'Lazarus' after John Chapter 11, when Jesus shouts to his friend 'Lazarus, come forth', and the dead man emerges from the tomb. Documents released by Ozark City Animal Shelter in Ozark, Alabama, confirm the scheduled appointment for Lazarus to be put to sleep on September 10. According to Two By Two Rescue, which now fosters the black shepherd-mix, dogs at the Ozark shelter are put to sleep (PTS) if they go un-adopted for more than a week. Lazarus's owner moved and handed him in, but when no willing dog-lover took him home, he was given a PTS date. 'That evening, a vet came to put to sleep the dogs on the list to die,' the organization explains on their Facebook page. Indestructible: The black shepherd mix is as energetic as ever, playing in the garden and going on walks . Miracle: He was one of a ward of dogs who were killed by lethal injection that night, but after two he still lived . Adorable: His foster owners at Two By Two Rescue in Alabama say he is obedient and house-trained . 'After euthanizing the dogs, he verifies that the heartbeat has ceased. 'As he checked this particular dog, he heard a faint heartbeat and euthanized him again. 'He rechecked his heartbeat and signed off on the records that the four-year-old black shepherd mix was dead. 'When the staff arrived in the morning, to their shock the dog was looking at them. He had even eaten his left over food from the day before. Playing around: Two By Two Rescue say Lazarus (left) is now in perfect health and energetically plays around . Policy: He was ordered to be put down at Ozark (pictured) because nobody wanted to adopt him after a week . 'Though scared and wobbly, he was sitting in his cage alive!' Now living with one of the heads of Two By Two Rescue, Lazarus is back to full fitness and responds affectionately to his new name when it is called. He has a healthy appetite, it house-trained, leash-trained, and doesn't jump on the furniture, they said. The owners gushed: 'When one reads of a modern day miracle, you do not have to think about whether you should raise your hand to help. Who does not want to be a part of a miracle? Who does not want to lay hands of love on the survivor of all time?'","Black shepherd mix survived a car accident before being put in a shelter .

"A 300-year-old burial area, in which two bodies were reduced to skeletons while one was perfectly preserved, has left Chinese archaeologists baffled. When one of the coffins was opened, the man's face, experts claim, was perfectly preserved. Within hours, however, the face started to go black, and a foul smell began to emanate from the body. Baffled Chinese archaeologists are studying a 300 year-old coffin found with two others in which two of the bodies had been reduced to skeletons, but in which the third was almost perfectly preserved . Clothes on the body of the 300-year-old Chinese corpse indicate he was a very senior official from the early Qing Dynasty. The Qing Dynasty, which lasted from 1644 . to 1912, followed the Ming dynasty and was the last imperial dynasty of . China before the creation of the Republic of China. Under . the Qing territory, the empire grew to three times its size. The . population increased from around 150 million to 450 million. The present-day boundaries of China are largely based on the territory controlled by the Qing dynasty . The skin on the corpse - which has now been taken to the local university for study - also turned black. The body is thought to be from the Qing Dynasty. It was unearthed on October 10 on a construction site in a two metre-deep hole in the ground at Xiangcheng in Henan province, central China. Dr Lukas Nickel, a specialist in Chinese art and archaeology at SOAS, University of London, told MailOnline that preservations such as these were not intentional. 'The Chinese did not do any treatment of the body to preserve it as known from ancient Egypt, for instance. 'They did, however, try to protect the body by putting it into massive coffins and stable tomb chambers. 'So the integrity of the physical structure of the body was important to them. In early China, at least, one expected the dead person to live on in the tomb.' Occasionally bodies in the Qing Dynasty were preserved by the natural conditions around the coffin. In this case, the body may have had a lacquered coffin, covered in charcoal - which was common at the time. This means bacteria would have been unable to get in. Dr Nickel added that if this was the case, as soon as air hit the body, the natural process would be for it to turn black and quickly disintegrate. When the coffin was opened by historians at Xiangcheng said the man's face was almost normal but within hours it had started to go black, and a foul smell had appeared . The body was unearthed on October 10 on a construction site in a two-metre-deep hole in the ground at Xiangcheng in Henan province, central China . Historian Dong Hsiung said: 'The clothes on the body indicate he was a very senior official from the early Qing Dynasty. 'What is amazing is the way time seems to be catching up on the corpse, ageing hundreds of years in a day.' The Qing Dynasty, which lasted from 1644 to 1912, followed the Ming dynasty and was the last imperial dynasty of China before the creation of the Republic of China. Under the Qing territory, the empire grew to three times its size and the population increased from around 150 million to 450 million. The present-day boundaries of China are largely based on the territory controlled by the Qing dynasty . Burial rituals in the Qing Dynasty were the responsiblity of the eldest son, and would have included a large number of officials. Professor Dong proposes an alternative theory for the preservation. 'It’s possible the man's family used some materials to preserve the body,' he said. 'Once it was opened the natural process of decay could really start.' 'We are working hard though to save what there is.' Historian Dong Hsiung said: 'The clothes on the body indicate he was a very senior official from the early Qing Dynasty. What is amazing is the way time seems to be catching up on the corpse, ageing hundreds of years in a day' The 700-year-old mummy was found in the city of Taizhou, in Jiangsu Province in 2011 . The Qing Dynasty, and the preceding Ming Dynasty, are known for their well-preserved corpses. In 2011, a 700-year-old mummy was discovered by chance in excellent condition in eastern China. The corpse of the high-ranking woman believed to be from the Ming Dynasty was stumbled across by a team who were looking to expand a street. Discovered two metres below the road surface, the woman's features - from her head to her shoes - retained their original condition, and had hardly deteriorated. The mummy was wearing traditional Ming dynasty costume, and in the coffin were bones, ceramics, ancient writings and other relics. Director of the Museum of Taizhou, Wang Weiyin, said that the mummy's clothes were made mostly of silk, with a little cotton. Researchers hope the latest finding could help them better understand the Qing dynasty's funeral rituals and customs, as well as more about how bodies were preserved.

"Researchers have found an entirely new  type of 'good' fat made in the body could help prevent and treat diabetes. The previously unidentified lipid molecules that increase insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control could be the latest weapon to tackle the type 2 diabetes epidemic. Unlike omega-3 fatty acids found in oily fish  which are not made in mammals, the good fat named fatty acid hydroxyl fatty acids, or FAHFAs, are molecules found in fat cells as well as other cells throughout the body. The protein Glut4m which  moves to the cell surface to help transport glucose from the blood into the cell after a meal. Scroll down for video . Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body's cells don't react to insulin. In 2012, 29.1 million Americans, or 9.3% of the population, had diabetes. Of the 29.1 million, 21.0 million were diagnosed, and 8.1 million were undiagnosed. Diabetes remains the 7th leading cause of death in the United States in 2010 . The NHS estimates in England there are approximately 3.1 million people over 16 with diabetes but by 2030 the figure is expected to rise to 4.6 million, with nine out of ten sufferers having type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (formerly called juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent diabetes), accounts for 5 to 10 out of 100 people who have diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system destroys the cells that release, eventually eliminating insulin production from the body. 'We were blown away to discover this completely new class of molecules,' Professor Barbara Kahn of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) said. Professor Alan Saghatelian of Salk Institute said: 'Based on their biology, we can add FAHFAs to the small list of beneficial lipids. 'These lipids are amazing because they can also reduce inflammation, suggesting that we might discover opportunities for these molecules in inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as diabetes.' The new findings, made by a team of scientists from and the Salk Institute, was published online in the journal Cell. They now join a small group of fatty acids known to benefit health, which also include omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. FAHFAs are actually produced and broken down inside the human body and Prof Kahn said 'This important feature gives FAHFAs an advantage in terms of therapeutic development because we can potentially modify the rate of production and breakdown throughout the body. 'Because we can measure FAHFA levels in blood, low levels may turn out to be an early marker for the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 'Consequently, if restoring FAHFA levels in insulin resistant individuals proves to be therapeutic, we may potentially be able to intervene before the development of frank diabetes.' The discovery was made using mice have with elevated fatty acids, a sign of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. The study use mass spectrometry to study the fat molecules they discovered four groups that were elevated 16-18-fold in the insulin resistant mice, but not in the normal mice. Further tests revealed that feeding the mice extra FAHFAs resulted in a rapid and dramatic drop in blood sugar and rise in insulin. They also looked at FAHFA levels in human fat and plasma from people who were insulin resistant and at high risk for developing diabetes. The FAHFA levels were found to be 50 to 75 per cent lower than levels in people with normal insulin sensitivity, suggesting that changes in FAHFA levels might be contributing to diabetes. The team also identified GPR-120, the cellular receptor that FAHFAs bind to. Prof Kahn said: 'When FAHFAs bind to GPR-120, they are able to control how much glucose is taken up into fat cells. Unlike omega-3 fatty acids found in oily fish, the good fat named fatty acid hydroxyl fatty acids, or FAHFAs, are molecules found in fat cells as well as other cells throughout the body. They now join a small group of fatty acids known to benefit health, which also include omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. 'The receptor may also be responsible for the effects of the novel lipids to reduce widespread macrophage activation, which is associated with obesity and with inflammatory diseases. 'The discovery of FAHFAs provides important new insights underlying metabolic and inflammatory diseases, and, of critical importance, offers viable new treatment avenues that we hope to be able to test in clinical trials. 'This is of critical importance as rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes remain at epidemic proportions worldwide.'","Fatty acid hydroxyl fatty acids, or FAHFAs, are molecules found in fat cells as well as other cells throughout the body .

"Convicted: Danny Fitzsimons, 31, was sentenced to at least 20 years  for the killings. It was claimed he was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder . A former British paratrooper who was imprisoned in Iraq after shooting dead two bodyguards during a gun rampage in Baghdad has gone on hunger strike and wants to be brought back to the UK. Daniel Fitzsimons, 35, gunned down ex-Royal Marine Paul McGuigan and Australian Darren Hoare, both 37, after going berserk while they were stationed in the capital working for security firm ArmorGroup, a subsidiary of G4S. He later claimed he was suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder following a number of army tours which left him with repeated flashbacks, nightmares and anxiety attacks. In 2011 Fitzsimons, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, who was hired by G4s despite a robbery conviction, narrowly escaped the death penalty and was jailed for 20 years in Iraq for double murder and wounding an Iraqi security guard. But at an inquest into the death of Scotsman McGuigan, of Peebles, Tweeddale, it was revealed Fitzsimons is now refusing to eat and wants to be transferred to a British jail to serve his sentence. He also also wants to give evidence at the inquest and his family asked for the case to be adjourned to take instructions from the double killer. The request was refused. Lawyer Paul Clark, on behalf of Fitzsimons's step-mother Liz said: 'The hunger strike wasn't realised over the potential transfer to a different position but was taken over prison conditions and the lack of access to a telephone. 'He had his first access to a telephone and the telephone call yesterday was made. I am informed that considerable progress has been made. 'This morning Mrs Fitzsimons received a telephone call due to ongoing correspondence between her and the Foreign Commonwealth Office in relation to his transfer.' McGuigan had been a Green Beret before taking up work as a bodyguard, during which he spent two years providing security to the late former Beatle George Harrison. The killings occurred on August 9 2009, just 36 hours after Fitzsimons arrived in Iraq to start work. The former soldier had been due to appear in court in Bolton accused of assaulting an Asian man on a train and also a firearms offence where he used a flare gun to scare off teenagers causing trouble outside his flat. Killed: Paul McGuigan, 37, from Peebles in Scotland, left, and Australian Darren Hoare, also 37, right, died in Baghdad in August 2009 after Danny Fitzsimons opened fire . Killed: Paul McGuigan, 37, from Peebles in Scotland with his partner Nicola Prestage. She gave birth to his daughter soon after his death . It emerged Fitzsimons had forged documents during the recruitment process to gain a position and G4S had failed to properly check his criminal record - an issue integral to the inquest. The families of both McGuigan and Fitzsimons will ask questions of G4S at the inquest to find why more stringent background checks weren't carried out to deem his suitability for armed work in Iraq. McGuigan's fiancée Nicola Prestage, from Droyslden, Greater Manchester, was pregnant when he was killed and she gave birth to their daughter prematurely one week after she had to identify his body once it was repatriated. Miss Prestage, who met Paul in April 2007, told the Stockport hearing the couple were inseparable when he was in Britain from Iraq for three weeks at a time. British security contractor Daniel Fitzsimons is seen after being convicted by an Iraqi court for killing two colleagues, in Baghdad February 28, 2011 . She said: 'We were due to get married in the February in Vegas. I spoke to him every day he was in Iraq. He would ring me after convoy and we then spoke on and off during the day and again at teatime we would go on Skype. 'Iraq is two hours ahead so on Saturday August 8 we went on Skype at about 6.30pm UK time. 'We discussed baby names and chose a cot and my daughter spoke to him about a riding lesson she had been on. Everything was fine and normal. 'He did tell me he had gone to the villas and he had picked someone up but he was a dodgy character. He had been saying he was the black sheep of the family and his family had disowned him and he was never going to go back to the UK. 'He didn't name him but I found out later it was Danny Fitzsimons. He thought the guy was a bit weird. He didn't think he was staying on the camp, he thought he was moving on the next day.' Miss Prestage said that while she was talking to her partner there was no indication he had been drinking and she didn't see him drink anything during the call which ended at 10.03pm UK time. He said he was going to bed and was dressed in his bed clothes. The following morning she received a telephone call to say Paul had been killed. She added: 'G4S proceeded to tell me there had been an accident and Paul had been killed. They said that Paul, Darren and another guy were drinking all night and were extremely intoxicated, there had been a brawl and Paul and Darren had been murdered. 'To which I told her that he couldn't have been up all night because I was speaking to him until 12.03am. He was a very kind, thoughtful and loving person devoted to both of his children and my daughter. He would have been so proud of his daughter.' A toxicology report revealed Paul was two-and-half times the legal drink drive limit at the time of his death, but the amount could have increased due to the period of time it took to repatriate his body from the Middle East. August 2009 . A G4S whistleblower sent a series of emails to the company in London, warning them about Fitzsimons’ previous convictions and unstable behaviour, before he was sent to Iraq. A 2012 BBC Scotland documentary claims that a G4S whistleblower sent an e-mail warning G4S: 'I am alarmed that he will shortly be allowed to handle a weapon and be exposed to members of the public. I am speaking out because I feel that people should not be put at risk.' August 9 2009 . Just 36 hours after arriving in Baghdad, Fitzsimons gunned down ex-Royal Marine Paul McGuigan and Australian Darren Hoare, both 37, after going berserk. It later emerged that he the former soldier had been due to appear in court in Bolton accused of assaulting an Asian man on a train and also a firearms offence where he used a flare gun to scare off teenagers causing trouble outside his flat. September 2009 . G4S admit that although there was evidence that Mr Fitzsimons falsified and apparently withheld material information during the recruitment process, his 'screening was not completed in line with the company's procedures'. February 2011 . Fitzsimons became the first Westerner to be convicted by an Iraqi court since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion when he was convicted in February last year, narrowly escaping the death penalty. The former security contractor from Rochdale admitted shooting the men but claimed it was self-defence. The men had been out drinking and the other two tried to kill him during an altercation, Fitzsimons said during previous testimony. He also claimed to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. September 2014 . Inquest into Paul McGuigan's death starts. Fitzsimons goes on hunger strike and wants to be brought back to the UK to help with an inquiry into the tragedy. Firefight: The shooting took place in Baghdad's secure Green Zone where foreign contract workers are based . McGuigan's mother mother Corinne Boyd-Russell said: 'We got a phonecall from Nicola at 7.30am on Sunday August 9. She was screaming down the phone, ""Paul is dead, Paul is dead"". 'We said it can't be, he wasn't on duty, it was his week off. She phoned back and told me he had been killed in some sort of accident at work. At this point I sort of shut down and don't really remember what happened. 'I was basically told that they couldn't say any more but according to them [G4S], he had been in an accident, they had all had a drink and ended up in a fight and two men were shot and another man was injured. 'My life has been completely changed by Paul's death. It's had a knock-on effect on the whole family. Health-wise, relationship-wise, everything.'

"An American suicide bomber who blew himself up for a group with links to al-Qaeda, attracted no attention from authorities despite having made an earlier trip to Syria. Moner Mohammad Abusalha, 22, a US college drop out, was part of a mass suicide bombing on May 25 in Syria which targeted several army positions. The al-Nusra Front, a militant Islamist group that has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, said he used a truck carrying explosives to conduct the attack. American suicide bomber, Moner Mohammad Abusalha, was not closely monitored by the authorities, despite having visited Syria the previous year where he was initially trained . The Florida college drop-out was part of a mass suicide bombing on May 25 in Syria . In May this year, Abusalha drove a truck packed with explosives toward a restaurant full of Syrian soldiers . Before he carried out the attack, Abusalha had already made a trip to the conflict zone, where he claimed he was first trained up. Between the two visits, he spent more than six months in the US but was not put under surveillance by the authorities. His movements went unmonitored despite a major push by U.S. security and intelligence agencies over the past two years to track the flow of foreign fighters in to and out of Syria. At the centre of that effort is a task force established by the FBI at a classified complex in Virginia that also involves the CIA and the National Counterterrorism Center. 'It is extremely difficult for the FBI to identify individuals in the U.S. who have this kind of goal,' said George Piro, special agent in charge of the FBI's Miami field office, which led the Abusalha investigation. 'It requires a loved one or really close friend to note the changes...The family has to intervene.' In Syria, the American attached himself to the extremist group, al-Nusra front, who have links to Al-Qaeda . Abusalha had already been to Syria the previous year, but the US officials allowed him back in to the country . Abusalha, who was a keen basketball player, initially departed for Syria in late January 2013. His first stay in the country was brief and he left a month later for Jordan where his grandparents lived, before making a pilgrimage by bus to the Islamic holy cities Mecca and Medina. He returned to the US on May 12, where he was questioned by custom officials. To verify his story, Custom and Border Protection officers called his mother who vouched for her son and said he had been visiting relatives. As such, Abusalha was allowed to make his way back in to the country. Back in the US, his movements were not monitored - despite his trip to the conflict zone. Just over six months later, in mid-November, Abusalha returned to Syria in a carefully disguised journey from New York to Istanbul to Cairo, which was a false endpoint. In a chilling video, he said: 'When I came to Syria, I had nothing. 'I had no money to buy a gun and ammunition, now God granted me all of that and much more. In a show of loyalty to the al-Nusra Front, Abusalha burned his US passport on a recorded video . Once back in Syria, Abusalha attached himself to the al-Nusra Front, an extremist group with links to Al Qaeda. In May this year, he drove a truck packed with explosives toward a restaurant full of Syrian soldiers. It is unknown how many people were killed in the bombing. Opposition rebels with the Nusra Front said Abusalha's truck was laden with 16 tons of explosives to tear down the al-Fanar restaurant, a gathering site for Syrian troops. The other suicide attackers targeted nearby army positions. U.S. counterterrorism officials are still debating the significance of al-Qaeda's decision to use Abusalha in an attack on the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, rather than aiming him at a Western target. Abusalha is counted among the 100 or so Americans who have travelled to Syria or attempted to do so . In a video released by The Nusra Front, the extremist group claimed two of the other three suicide attackers in the assault in the government-held northwestern city of Idlib were from foreign countries, including one from the Maldives. In the footage, Abusalha is shown saying: 'Glorious is God, and thanks God, his is a grace from him. When I came to Syria, I had nothing. 'I had no money to buy a gun and ammunition, now God granted me all of that and much more.' 'Heaven is better,' he said in a previously-released video. 'When people die they either go to heaven or hell. There is happiness beyond explanation. 'You are not safe. I have one word to say ... we are coming for you. Mark my words. 'You think you killed Osama bin Laden? You sent him to paradise. 'Just know that we are coming.' Beach life: Abusalha grew up in Florida and attended several colleges before dropping out and moving abroad . The Vero Beach Florida home of the America suicide bomber's parents . Abusalha grew up in Florida and attended several colleges before dropping out and moving abroad. He lived in various parts of the Sunshine State, where his parents ran several grocery stores. At one point, he shared an apartment with his brother about 130 miles from Miami. The 22-year-old had appeared to have had a regular American upbringing, playing on a basketball youth league, and enjoying sports. Abusalha is counted among the 100 or so Americans who have travelled to Syria or attempted to do so, according to senior US officials. But in reality, officials admit, the total has risen to 130 or more, and it includes individuals about whom only fragments of information are known. The clearest cases­ involve U.S. citizens arrested by the FBI before they depart. But other cases are incomplete, based on false names or partial identities assembled from references on social media or U.S. intelligence sources. Americans account for a tiny fraction of an estimated 15,000 fighters who have flocked to Syria from other nations. The majority are from elsewhere in the Middle East, but at least 700 have travelled or attempted to travel from France, with an additional 400 from Britain and 250 from Germany.","Moner Mohammad Abusalha was part of mass suicide bombing in Syria .

"A World Health Organization official has warned there could be up to 10,000 new cases of Ebola per week over the next two months and that the death rate has now increased to 70 per cent . WHO assistant director-general Dr. Bruce Aylward gave the figure during a news conference Tuesday. He said that the 70 per cent death rate was 'a high mortality disease' in any circumstance and that the U.N. health agency was still focused on trying to get sick people isolated and provide treatment as early as possible. Scroll down for video . New figures: A World Health Organization official says there could be up to 10,000 new cases of Ebola per week for the next two months . Previously, WHO had said the death rate was around 50 per cent. Dr Aylward says if the response to the Ebola crisis isn't stepped up within 60 days, 'a lot more people will die' and there will be a huge need on the ground to deal with the spiraling numbers of cases. He said WHO estimated there could up to 10,000 cases per week in two months. WHO assistant director-general Dr. Bruce Aylward said the death rate from the disease was now 50 per cent. Previously, WHO had said the death rate was around 50 per cent . Aylward said for the last four weeks, there have been about 1,000 new cases per week, though that figure includes suspected, confirmed and probable cases. He said WHO is aiming to have 70 per cent of cases isolated within two months to reverse the outbreak. WHO increased its Ebola death toll tally to 4,447, nearly all of them in West Africa, and the group said the number of probable and suspected cases was 8,914. Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia have been hardest hit. Aylward said WHO was very concerned about the continued spread of Ebola in the three countries' capital cities -Freetown, Conakry and Monrovia. He noted that while certain areas were seeing cases decline, 'that doesn't mean they will get to zero.' He said the agency was still focused on trying to treat Ebola patients, despite the huge demands on the broken health systems in West Africa. 'It would be horrifically unethical to say that we're just going to isolate people,' he said, noting that new strategies like handing out protective equipment to families and setting up very basic clinics - without much treatment - was a priority. In Berlin, a U.N. medical worker infected with Ebola in Liberia died despite 'intensive medical procedures.' The St. Georg hospital in Leipzig said Tuesday that the 56-year-old man, whose name has not been released, died overnight of the infection. The man tested positive for Ebola on Oct. 6, prompting Liberia's U.N. peacekeeping mission to place 41 other staff members under 'close medical observation.' Treatment: A Liberian health worker gives medication to a young Ebola patient at the MSF Treatment Unit in Monrovia . Precaution: A nurse disinfects a motorcycle taxi that was used to transport a . suspected Ebola patient at the MSF treatment Unit in Monrovia, Liberia . He arrived in Leipzig for treatment on Oct. 9. The hospital's chief executive, Dr. Iris Minde, said at the time there was no risk of infection for other people, since he was kept in a secure isolation ward specially equipped with negative pressure rooms that are hermetically sealed. He was the third Ebola patient to be flown to Germany for treatment. The first man recovered and returned home to Senegal. A Uganda aid worker is still being treated in Frankfurt. International aid organisation Doctors Without Borders said that 16 of its staff members have been infected with Ebola, and nine of them have died. Grim task: Liberian health workers in a burial squad carry an Ebola victim's body for cremation from the ELWA treatment center in Monrovia, Liberia . Speaking at a press conference in Johannesburg, the head of Doctors Without Borders in South Africa, Sharon Ekambaram, said medical workers have received inadequate assistance from the international community. She said that while many pledges had been made publicly they have not improved the situation in the affected countries. Juli Switala, a doctor working for the international aid organisation who just returned from Sierra Leone, said the number of those who have died from Ebola is probably an underestimate because many families hide their sick and dying loved ones. More than 4,000 people have died from Ebola so far, according to the World Health Organisation.","WHO assistant director-general  gave the figure during a news conference .

"The family home of a distinguished British commander who ordered the Charge of the Light Brigade has gone up for sale - with a guide price of £1.65million. The 15-bedroom mansion was given to the family of Lord Raglan in recognition of his military career at some of the greatest battles in history. In his early career, Lord Raglan served at the side of the Duke of Wellington during the Battle of Waterloo, during which  his arm was amputated and he had to ask for it back to remove his wedding ring. Lord Raglan went on to be the senior commander of British Forces during the Crimean War - during which he gave the orders for the charge immortalised by Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s poem and its famous line: 'Into the valley of death rode the six hundred.' The Wales home of the British officer and Crimean War commander Lord Raglan (pictured) has been put up for sale with asking price of £1.6million . The property is currently owned by Lord Raglan's Los Angeles-based descendant and recruitment consultant Henry van Moyland . Lord Raglan was the commander in charge for the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade, later made famous by Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem . Lord Raglan, pictured left and right, died at the age of 66 after a distinguished military career which saw him lose an arm in the Battle of Waterloo . Lord Raglan was 66 when he died of dysentery the following year - and never saw the huge mansion which was bought for his family by friends and admirers. An inscription over the porch states: 'This house with 238 acres of land was purchased by 1623 of the friends, admirers and comrades in arms of the late Field Marshal Lord Raglan GCB (Knight Grand Cross) and presented by them to his son and his heirs for ever in a lasting memorial of affectionate regard and respect'. Lord Raglan - Field Marshal FitzRoy James Henry Somerset - was portrayed by Sir John Gielgud in the 1968 film 'The Charge of the Light Brigade'. The house, called Cefntilla, is located in the rolling Monmouthshire countryside and has been passed down through the generations. At its height in 1964, the estate ran to more than 1,000 acres and included six farms after the fourth Lord Raglan expanded on the original 238 acres. But it has been sold off bit by bit over the years and the unmodernised mansion house and 62 acres of land is being sold after the death of the fifth Lord Raglan, FitzRoy Somerset, in January 2010. The huge 15 bedroom mansion is set in the Monmouthshire countryside. Pictured is one the home's several living rooms . Another of the house's living rooms. Those selling the home have suggested an asking price of about £1.6million for the property . The Grade-II listed property, called Cefntilla, dates back to 1616 but it is believed to require expensive refurbishment work. Pictured is a dining room . An illustration of Lord Ragan, who was the British commander that ordered the Charge of the Light Brigade . The Charge of the Light Brigade on October 25, 1854, was one of the bloodiest battles of the  Crimean War. On that fateful day, the British light cavalry - led by Lord Cardigan - were sent into a frontal assault on a well armed and prepared Russian artillery. It's believed there was a problem in the chain of command and Lord Raglan had thought he was sending the 600 men to a completely different, retreating, artillery unit. Instead the charging cavalry met a ferocious and heavily armed resistance - the brigade was quickly forced to retreat and in the process, suffered huge losses. There were 245 casualties, which included 118 dead. The charge was immortalised in literature after it was the subject of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem 'The Charge of the Light Brigade'. The poem reads: 'Half a league, half a league, Half a league onward, All in the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. “Forward, the Light Brigade! Charge for the guns!” he said. Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. “Forward, the Light Brigade!” Was there a man dismayed? Not though the soldier knew Someone had blundered. Theirs not to make reply, Theirs not to reason why, Theirs but to do and die. Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. 'Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them Volleyed and thundered; Stormed at with shot and shell, Boldly they rode and well, Into the jaws of Death, Into the mouth of hell Rode the six hundred. 'Flashed all their sabres bare, Flashed as they turned in air Sabring the gunners there, Charging an army, while All the world wondered. Plunged in the battery-smoke Right through the line they broke; Cossack and Russian Reeled from the sabre stroke Shattered and sundered. Then they rode back, but not Not the six hundred. 'Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon behind them Volleyed and thundered; Stormed at with shot and shell, While horse and hero fell. They that had fought so well Came through the jaws of Death, Back from the mouth of hell, All that was left of them, Left of six hundred. 'When can their glory fade? O the wild charge they made! All the world wondered. Honour the charge they made! Honour the Light Brigade, Noble six hundred!' The Grade II-listed property is now owned by one of Fitzroy’s nephews, Los Angeles based recruitment consultant Henry van Moyland, who has decided to finally sell off the family’s crown jewel. Estate agent Knight Frank describe Cefntilla, which dates back to 1616, as one Britain’s finest country mansions - but it will need millions invested in it to bring it up to standard. A spokesman said: 'It is one of Monmouthshire’s finest houses with beautiful grounds and extensive parkland. 'For the last 150 years has been the seat of the Lord Raglan but the original Jacobean house can be dated by the fireplace in the Great Hall, inscribed ""1616"". 'It fell into disrepair but was rescued in 1858 by the Raglan Memorial Committee who purchased the house and estate for the widow and descendants of FitzRoy Somerset 1st Lord Raglan, who had died in the Crimean War whilst leading the British expeditionary force.' The family’s landmark collection of Crimean and Napoleonic War memorabilia was also sold for £2m earlier this year.","Home of British officer and Crimean War commander Lord Raglan has been put up for sale with asking price of £1.6m .

"Parents can be held liable for what their children post on Facebook, the Georgia Court of Appeals has ruled. The court has decided that the parents of seventh-grade student, Dustin Athearn, may be negligent after failing to get him to delete a fake Facebook profile that allegedly defamed his classmate Alexandria Boston. The decision could now set a legal precedent on the issue of parental responsibility over their children’s online activity. Parents can be held liable for what their children post on Facebook, the Georgia Court of Appeals has ruled (stock image) The case dates to an incident in May 2011, when Athearn from Palmer Middle School in Kennesaw created a Facebook profile pretending to be his classmate  Boston, reports Courthouse News Service. Using a ‘fat face’ app, he manipulated a photo he’d taken of the girl to make her look obese. He also added to the unauthorized profile included graphically sexual and racist comments, references to Boston's purported homosexual orientation, and other offensive material. The profile also falsely stated that Boston was taking drugs for mental health disorders, as well as illegal drugs, according to a October 10 ruling. The account was then connected to more than 70 Facebook users via invites Athearn sent to Boston's classmates, teachers and family. The court has decided that the parents of seventh-grade student, Dustin Athearn, may be negligent after failing to get him to delete a fake Facebook profile that allegedly defamed his classmate Alexandria Boston (stock photo) Should parents be liable for what their children post on Facebook? Boston’s parents complained to the school about Athearn’s actions and he was given two days of in-school suspension. The school also alerted his parents, who grounded him for a week. However for the next 11 months the page remained live until April 2012. It wasn’t deleted until Facebook deactivated the account shortly after Boston's parents sued Athearn and his parents in state court. The girl’s lawyer says the child’s parents didn’t immediately confront the boy’s parents because their school refused to identify the culprit for confidentiality reasons. The Bostons, who sought damages for libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress, claimed the Athearns made no efforts to view the defamatory posts or to compel their son to delete them after they found out about them. The offending profile wasn’t deleted until Facebook deactivated the account shortly after Boston's parents sued Athearn and his parents in state court (stock photo) The Cobb County Superior Court initially dismissed the Bostons' negligence claims against the parents, but on Friday the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed that decision. They found that a jury should determine whether the Athearns failed to supervise their son's use of the computer and internet account relating to the alleged defamation. ‘Given that the false and offensive statements remained on display, and continued to reach readers, for an additional eleven months, we conclude that a jury could find that the [parents'] negligence proximately caused some part of the injury [the girl] sustained from [the boy's] actions (and inactions),’ wrote Judge John Ellington. Although the Athearns could not anticipate that their son would use the computer in a harmful way, once they found out about the creation of the fake profile, they had a duty to supervise his computer activities, the 15-page ruling states. 'While it may be true that Alex was harmed, and the tort of defamation had accrued, when even one person viewed the false and offensive postings, it does not follow that the Athearns' parental duty of reasonable supervision ended with the first publication,' wrote Ellington.","The Georgia Court of Appeals has ruled that Dustin Athearn's parents may be negligent after failing to get him to delete a fake Facebook profile .

"Pope Francis said that guardian angels exist and people who listen to their advice are less likely to make the wrong decisions. 'The doctrine on angels is not fantasist. No, it's reality,' the pope said on Thursday during his daily mass in the small chapel in his residence at the Vatican. 'According to Church tradition we all have an angel with us, who protects us and helps us understand things,' he said in a message to mark the feast of the guardian angels, celebrated by Catholics on October 2. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis said that guardian angels exist and people who listen to their advice are less likely to make the wrong decisions . The up-beat message that humans are helped along in life by an otherworldly guardian was in stark contrast to former pope Benedict's insistence in 2012 that angels did not sing at the birth of Christ -- news that devastated many a carol singer and earned him the epithet 'killjoy pope'. Francis asked 'how often have we heard 'I should do this, I should not do this, that's not right, be careful ...'. So often! It is the voice of our travelling companion.' The pope advised sceptics to ask themselves 'how is my relationship with my guardian angel? Do I listen to him? Do I say good morning to him? Do I ask him to watch over me when I sleep? 'No one journeys alone and no one should think that they are alone,' he said. His comments came ahead of a global assembly of Roman Catholic bishops that's shaping up as the first major showdown of Pope Francis's papacy, with conservative and progressive cardinals trading insults ahead of its start on Sunday. The up-beat message that humans are helped along in life by an otherworldly guardian was in stark contrast to former pope Benedict's insistence in 2012 that angels did not sing at the birth of Christ . The two-week synod on the theme of the family will be attended by more than 250 people - nearly all of them bishops of the 1.2 billion-member Church and also 13 married couples. The session will prepare the way for a larger gathering of Catholic clerics next year and could become a milestone in the clash between conservatives and liberals over the future direction of a Church that the pope has insisted must become less bureaucratic and theologically esoteric. The synod, the first since Francis' election in March 2013, is seen as a test case for him and his vision of a Church he wants to be closer to the poor and suffering and not 'obsessed' by issues such as homosexuality, abortion and contraception. The run-up to the meeting has been dominated by a rare public feud between cardinals centred on whether the Church should modify teachings that ban Catholics who have divorced and then remarried in civil services from receiving communion. For Catholics, a second marriage without an often lengthy Church annulment of the first amounts to adultery and anyone remarried in a civil ceremony cannot receive communion at Mass unless they refrain from sexual relations with a new partner. That issue has emerged as the most likely candidate for possible reform after Pope Francis ordered a worldwide survey of Catholics and heard that many ignored Church teachings on birth control, sex before marriage or acceptance of homosexuality. Cardinal Walter Kasper, a German the pope has called one of his favourite theologians, has argued that the Church must find ways of showing mercy to people whose first marriages have failed and who want to remain an integral part of the Church. But even the suggestion of change has galvanized conservatives, including a handful of senior Vatican officials.","Pope Francis said that 'the doctrine on angels is not fantasist'

"Democrats' hopes of retaining the Senate and winning back the House are looking bleaker and bleaker these days as national polls foretell disaster for the president's party in next month's elections. One particularly crushing blow to Democrats' chances is an ABC News/Washington Post poll released this morning that puts the party's popularity level at its lowest point in 30 years and Obama's approval rating at a career low. Worse, significantly more likely voters who took the poll said they would cast a ballot against Obama on Election Day, 26 percent, than those who said they would vote to show their support for him, 14 percent. President Barack Obama speaks about the effort to destroy ISIS at a meeting with the military leadership from 21 coalition partner nations on Tuesday. Despite Obama's efforts to convince Americans that he has the situation under control, likely voters overwhelming said they trusted Republicans to finish off the terrorist group than Democrats . President Barack Obama's approval rating is at a career low. Worse, just 33 percent of voters not affiliated with either major party gave Obama high praise. That spells bad news for Democrats in November . The release of the poll spelling doom for Democrats was coupled by a report from Politico that President Barack Obama will limit his campaigning the week before the election to states with competitive gubernatorial races. The move by the White House could signal a shift in focus away from winning control of Congress. It may also be evidence of just how unwelcome the president is at events with House and Senate candidates from his own political party. The newly released ABC News poll found that Obama is viewed favorably by just 40 percent of Americans. More telling is that voters who say they're not aligned with either major party gave Obama a 33 percent approval rating. Respondents to the poll also gave Obama historically low ratings for his handling of immigration, international affairs and terrorism. Furthermore, seven out 10 survey takers said they fear that terrorists will carry out another attack on the U.S, and likely voters gave Republicans a 22 point advantage when it came to who they trust most to defeat ISIS. The only major issues that presumed voters said they believed Democrats were best equipped to tackle were 'helping the middle class' and 'women's issues. Democrats carried the women's issues category by 22 points, suggesting that the GOP is still battling the notion that it's at war with women. And while Republicans are even less liked by voters than Democrats and have a 33 percent positive rating compared to Democrats' 39 percent, ABC's pollsters found that GOP congressional candidates have a significant lead over their opponents. Republican contenders for the House of Representatives hold a 50-43 percent lead over their Democratic competitors among likely voters, the survey shows. Congressional Democrats hoping to close the gap in the final weeks of the race were confronted with even more bad news today as their party chair revealed that weak spending from outside groups could cost them as many as three dozen seats. 'Look, it’s more of a challenge than we would like it to be,' Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel told reporters today during a briefing. 'It is frustrating that the cavalry that has always been there don’t seem to be there,' the New York representative said, according to Politico. First lady Michelle Obama is pictured here at a campaign rally for for Pennsylvania Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf this afternoon. The White House has turned its focus to helping members of the president's party competing for their states' executive mansions as national Democrats appear less and less likely to win the Senate. They have almost no hope of winning the House . Already, Democrats have a 17-seat deficit in the House of Representatives. Republicans are predicted to expand their dominance in the lower chamber by at least five seats, if not more. The GOP hopes to win at least 11 additional seats this election cycle in order to achieve an overwhelming majority not seen by Republicans in the House since the '40s. Polling site Real Clear Politics ranks 17 seats as toss ups and predicts that two seats currently held by Republican lawmakers will go to Democrats. RCP lists just one district represented by a Democrat as a probable Republican pick-up opportunity. That means Republicans would have to win 15 of the 17 toss-up races listed by Real Clear Politics in order to achieve it's goal, an unlikely scenario. Israel said today that he doesn't believe any of the seats Democrats are fighting to the finish for are a lost cause yet, but the trickle of spending from Democratic political action committees suggests that other major players in his party think otherwise. The 2014 elections were always Republicans to lose, as Democrats traditionally turn out in low numbers in midterm years. Voters also tend to support the party who's guy is not in the executive seat of power during midterm elections, as well. The dynamics of the midterm elections, combined with president's poor approval rating, have given Republicans the upper hand in the Senate, too. While RCP has Republicans and Democrats neck and neck for control of the legislature's upper chamber, only two of the seats on the site's toss-up list are currently held by Republicans. The other eight belong to Democratic lawmakers. As such, President Obama has reportedly set his sights on the country's governors races, which Democrats have a substantially stronger chance of winning, and will campaign for candidates in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Maine and Michigan, according to a White House official who spoke with Politico. This upcoming weekend he'll also appear at events with Democratic candidates for governor in Maryland and Illinois. Obama was supposed to headline an event for Connecticut's governor today, but the White House announced at the last minute that the president, who is notorious for campaigning in the midst of crises, would stay in Washington to focus on the government's response to the Ebola outbreak. Last night news broke that a second hospital worker at the Texas facility where Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan was treated had contracted Ebola. Duncan met an untimely death last Wednesday after doctors unsuccessfully treated him for the deadly disease. Nearly two-thirds of respondents to ABC News' poll, which was conducted from the day after Duncan died until Sunday, said they're worried about an Ebola epidemic in the U.S. The poll does not appear to have asked them how they feel about Obama's response to the emergency so far.","Democrats' odds of retaining the Senate and winning back the House are rapidly dwindling .

"Coalition relations are at breaking point as a furious row saw Nick Clegg branded a ‘w*****’ by Conservative colleagues. The row followed Home Secretary Theresa May’s bitter attack on the Lib Dem leader’s refusal to give police and intelligence services powers to monitor internet, email and phone use of terror suspects. Mrs May, increasingly tipped as a future Tory leader, accused the Lib Dems of being ‘outrageously irresponsible’ in blocking legislation to address a ‘crisis in national security’, claiming they had put children’s lives at risk. The row between Theresa May and Nick Clegg came after the Lib Dem leader's refusal to give police services to monitor phone calls of terror suspects . Yesterday, Mr Clegg demanded an apology over what he called ‘a new low point in Coalition relations’, accusing Mrs May of ‘false and outrageous slurs’. He said: ‘I have made it very, very clear to her that I expect an apology from her.’ But the Prime Minister backed Mrs May last night and Mr Clegg’s complaint was ridiculed by senior Tories. One told the Daily Mail that Mr Clegg was a ‘w*****’, and claimed his request to see the Home Secretary’s conference speech in advance this week had been rejected. Another source close to Mrs May repeated the accusation that the Lib Dems were putting children at risk. ‘It’s interesting to see how the Lib Dems react to the logic of their position being aired in public but the truth is that they are putting lives at risk right now,’ the source said. ‘If they want to do something about that, they can start talking to us about returning to the Comms Data Bill that Nick Clegg first torpedoed on his radio show two years ago.’ Last night Lib Dem MP Duncan Hames called for an official investigation into the use of derogatory language to describe Mr Clegg. He said the aide had breached the special adviser code of conduct. David Cameron backed the Home Secretary, saying: ‘I thought Theresa May made a very strong speech about how important it is that we protect people from the dangers of terrorism on our streets and she set out a series of measures we have taken. 'She set out some measures that a Conservative-only government would take to make us even more safe.’ Mr Clegg has now demanded an apology over what he called ‘a new low point in Coalition relations’ Government sources suggested the Coalition had entered a ‘new phase’ with just over 200 days to go before the General Election. ‘The two parties are going to make it clearer than ever where they disagree,’ said one Tory minister. Yesterday’s row focused on plans for a Communications Data Bill, which would have meant telecommunications firms storing details of the time, duration, location and recipients of messages sent on social media, emails and mobile phones for up to 12 months. Mrs May said it was vital to allow the authorities to gain more insight into terrorist plots and other crimes. But last year, Mr Clegg announced he was blocking the plans. The Home Office claims that as a result, over the past six months the National Crime Agency dropped 20 cases because of missing communications data, 13 of which involved a threat to the lives of children. Mr Clegg, speaking on LBC Radio, said: ‘To say I’ve put children at risk is a level of misinformation I’ve not witnessed in four and a half years of this government.’ Mrs May, increasingly tipped as a future Tory leader, accused the Lib Dems of being ‘outrageously irresponsible’ in blocking legislation . ‘The reason the National Crime Agency had to drop some of these cases was because IP addresses were not properly matched to individual mobile devices. ‘I have been saying for months that that is a problem we should deal with, and guess who has been dragging their feet to do something about it – the Home Office. 'I think I am entitled to be a little bit aggrieved to hear a Conservative Home Secretary somehow claiming that my party is putting children at risk when it is their inactivity that is doing just that.’ Meanwhile Tory MPs are pressing Mr Cameron to move more quickly on his pledge to raise the 40p tax threshold to £50,000. The Prime Minister has pledged to raise the starting threshold from its current level of £41,865 by 2020. But MP Kwasi Kwarteng suggested the tax cut could be implemented in three years. He said: ‘We have always got to take care of the deficit and for that reason it can’t be done in one go immediately. 'But we need to do it as quickly as possible, and there is no reason why we couldn’t do it in three years.’","Row comes after Mr Clegg refused to back powers for intelligence services .

"Seeking to avoid the fate of a fellow Democrat who fumbled the ball when asked about her support for President Barack Obama, Georgia senate candidate Michelle Nunn said on Friday that she did in fact vote for the Obama in the last two elections. 'I did vote for the president,' Nunn told the Washington Post in an interview this afternoon. 'I have said throughout the campaign that we need more people in Washington working with the president – Republican or Democrat – to get things done. I pledge to do that on behalf of Georgians,' she added. When confronted by a tracker for America Rising, a Republican opposition research outfit, on Wednesday, Nunn had refused to say whether she voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate Michelle Nunn, center, arrives for early voting with her daughter Elizabeth and husband Ron Martin, left, at Fulton County's Adamsville Recreation Center on Wednesday. Nunn was reportedly confronted by a tracker outside the venue and asked whether she voted for Barack Obama for president. The Georgia Senate candidate wouldn't respond . Her only response was in the form of a grin she gave her questioner as she walked away from him and toward the entrance of the venue she was about to enter, an early voting center at the Adamsville Recreation Center, in Atlanta, Georgia. 'Ms. Nunn, did you vote for President Obama in 2008 and 2012?' the tracker had asked her, pouncing on an opportunity to toss Nunn the same question that's tripped up Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes of Kentucky. A Nunn supporter can then be heard in the background telling the young man, 'Would you leave her alone?' As Nunn and her gaggle of supporters continued walking, other members of her entourage began touting President Obama's accomplishments. 'Yes, of course, yes, he’s the president…he’s done great things,' one of the supporters said. 'He's doing great things. Great things,' another voice said in response. Nunn's refusal to speak to the tracker is not surprising given his party affiliation and the nature of his question. But the Democratic candidate's non-answer could have come back to haunt her in her close race against businessman David Perdue. Multiple polls conducted in late September and early October had Perdue leading Nunn by several digits. A SurveyUSA poll released on Wednesday shows a reversal, with Nunn now up by three points. The race could just as easily flip back in Perdue's favor in the next two and a half weeks, however, and pollsters expect this race to be a nail biter. Nunn is the daughter of former Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, a notable Democrat who has given thousands of dollars to Obama's election efforts. She's currently on leave of absence from her day job as CEO of Georgia-based non-profit organization Points of Light. Perdue is the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, also a Republican. The self-funded, former  Dollar General head defeated Republican Congressman Jack Kingston in a brutal primary this summer to win the GOP nomination. Nunn and Perdue are competing to replace retiring Republican politician Saxby Chambliss. A third, Libertarian candidate, Amanda Swafford, is also vying for the seat and could prove a spoiler on Election Day. Swafford is steadily polling at five percent of the vote. If neither Nunn or Perdue is able to win 50 percent of the vote, Georgia law calls for a run-off election that won't be held until early next year when other newly elected senators are already descending on Washington to begin the new legislative session. Michele Nunn, right, and her family participate in early voting on Wednesday in Atlanta. Nunn is running against Republican David Perdue. The two are virtually tied two and a half weeks ahead of the election. Nunn said on Friday that she did in fact vote for Obama in the last two presidential elections . Neither major political party wants an extended campaign season lasting into 2015, and both the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are pouring loads of cash into the race on behalf of their respective candidates. Earlier this week the DSCC announced that it would go dark in Kentucky, where its candidate repeatedly stumbled over questions about her support for Obama, in order to shift $1 million into Nunn's race in Georgia. Ironically, Nunn could have become the next victim of the 'did she or didn't she' vote for Obama conundrum that has plagued Kentucky's Grimes if she hadn't admitted her support for Obama today. Nunn is hardly alone in her attempt to distance herself from Obama, though, whose approval rating is at a career low, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll that came out on Wednesday. New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, Colorado Sen. Mark Udall, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor and Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu have all went out of their way to avoid being associated with Obama this year as they wage reelection bids. Udall is the senator who was supposed to appear at a July fundraiser with Obama, then cancelled at the last minute to stay in Washington. He claimed at a debate in September that the 'White House when they look down the front lawn the last person they want to see coming is me.' U.S. Senate candidates bearing Obama's party ID are avoiding the president like the plague. As a result, Obama, who is seen here delivering remarks during a cabinet level meeting at the White House on Wednesday, hasn't made a single public appearance on behalf of a Democratic contender this fall . Another Colorado Democrat, Gov. John Hickenlooper, is now claiming that he was never a proponent of Obama's signature healthcare reform law. At a debate earlier this week against Republican Bob Beauprez, Hickenlooper said while talking about health care, 'and again, I'm not big fan of the Affordable Care Act, I wouldn't have designed it that...' He stopped short of finishing his sentence as he was both interrupted by his opponent and booed by members of the live audience. As his Republican opponent immediately pointed out on Twitter after the debate, Hickenlooper was singing a slightly different tune when the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the individual mandate portion of Obamacare was constitutional. A press release from Hickenlooper's office includes a direct quote from the governor praising the legislation. 'More Coloradans will benefit when the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented in 2014,' he said. Once considered a rising star of the Democratic Party, Hickenlooper is trailing Beauprez by four points, per a Quinnipiac poll that came out yesterday. The incumbent governor is gaining on Beauprez, who was once ahead by 10 points, but he the race still leans heavily in Beauprez's favor. Like Udall, Hickenlooper also skipped events with Obama when the president was in town this summer. He memorably grabbed a beer and shot pool with the president when they bumped into each other at a local bar, however. Obama won both games.","When confronted by a tracker for a Republican outfit on Wednesday about her vote,  Nunn stayed mum .

"It's a creature like never, well according to one fisherman, seen before! So what it is? A shocked fisherman in Singapore is convinced he made have found an alien after he made an interesting and rather creepy discovery while fishing at his favourite spot on the island of Sentosa. Ong Han Boon, 54, was left scratching his head when he hauled up a strange creature from the water with moving tentacle like arms, something like a mutant octopus. He captured the bizzare find on video and as curiosity got the better of him decided to post it online to see if anyone, or his friends could add a little insight into what the creature was. SCROLL DOWN TO VIDEO . A shocked fisherman in Singapore is convinced he made have found an alien after he made an interesting and rather creepy discovery while fishing at his favourite spot on the island of Sentosa . 'When I pulled it out of the water, I was completely flummoxed by what I was looking at,' he told the Mirror UK. 'I've had quite a few odd things come out of the ocean, but I have never seen anything like this before in my life. It had all these arms waving around.' 'I thought it looked like some kind of alien or mutant.' 'So, if no one can't identify it then I guess I’m right - it’s either an alien or I’ve discovered a new species of mutant sea creature,' he told the Mirror . But it seems this creature is actually a known species. Sydney marine biologist Dr. Will Figueira says it is in fact a 'Basket Star'. 'They are in the same group as starfish and are most closely related to brittle stars,' he said. 'They use all those tentacles to move around and hunt for prey.' 'The group as a whole is famous for having some species which live in the deep ocean but many species are also commonly found as shallow as 30 - 50 metres.' 'When I pulled it out of the water, I was completely flummoxed by what I was looking at,' said the fisherman .","A bizarre mutant creature has been found by a Singapore fisherman .

"One of Jamaica's most beautiful stretches of beach could all but disappear in the next 30 years, experts have warned. Hundreds of thousands of tourists a year make the journey to Negril on Jamaica's Western coast, famed for its postcard white sandy beach, clear turquoise waters and laidback lifestyle. But the stretch of palm-fringed shoreline known as Seven Mile Beach is under severe threat as its sands are slipping away every year due to erosion and rising sea levels. The beach in better days: Seven Mile Beach in Long Bay, Negril, which could disappear within 30 years . A drop in the ocean: a local rakes a thin strip of sand separating beach cottages in Western Jamaica . Every morning groundsmen with metal rakes tend to Negril's resort-lined shore in an attempt to repair the daily damage. Some sections, however, are barely wide enough for a  beach towel and the Jamaican National Environment and Planning Agency says sand is receding at a worrying rate of more than a metre a year. 'The beach could be totally lost within 30 years,' said Anthony McKenzie, a senior director at the agency. Locals fear they will have to find a new nickname for the seven mile stretch of land, one of the top destinations which brings in millions of dollars from tourists in a country where a quarter of all jobs depend on tourism. 'If the water takes over this beach, well, that's the end of the tourists,' said Lyn Dennison who owns a beach side jewellery stand. Already message boards and thread on sites such as TripAdvisor have spring up, written by worried travellers who aren't sure whether there will be any beach left by the time their holiday is booked. September 2014: the tide gnaws away - up to a metre a year - at resort lined 'Seven Mile Beach' in Caribbean . Barely room to swing a cat: some sections are barely wide enough for a  beach towel and locals are panicked . Negril - thought to be named  after the black cliffs to the south of the village  - was for years an isolated fishing outpost after Spanish explorers arrived in 1494. It wasn't until the 1950s and 1960s that it became a resort location, drawing ferries to drop off passengers in the bay then let them wade ashore to camp or stay with locals. Lured by the idyllic scenery, relaxed atmosphere and cheap marijuana American hippies, party goers and more sober-minded travellers woke up to the area's charm. Resorts such as Sandals and the Grand Lido sprang up and the number of annual visitors grew from about 40,000 in 1980 to more than 400,000 in 2012. Now, there's certainly a note of panic in the air as the environmental and economic impact of the shrinking coastline concentrates the minds of the local population. Another option for Negril? A seawall  in The Turks and Caicos Islands which prevents sea damage to properties . Drawn by palm fringed shores (left) the number of annual visitors grew to the village of Negril from about 40,000 in 1980 to more than 400,000 in 2012 as they work up to the charms of the area . Fearful of losing their main attraction, some hoteliers are pressing the government to refill the beach with dredged sand, a pricey step many experts say will only be a temporary fix. Jamaica is also planning to build submerged breakwaters to absorb wave energy and slow loss of shoreline, costing almost £3.4 million ($5.4 million) in grants from a U.N. climate change convention. This project, which one study estimates could cost as much as £48 million ($77 million) over 80 years, offers a glimpse of what may lie ahead for other similar Caribbean coastal locations. These islands, many already heavily in debt, will be faced with the choice of trying to armour shores with seawalls and breakwaters, or conducting a costly retreat from seas that the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says could rise by nearly a metre by the end of the century. The future? A breakwater already in place in Helengeli, Maldives similar to what might  be used in Jamaica . Some are sceptical of seawall tactics. 'For many beaches, adaptation measures such as bringing in sand and creating seawalls will only slow the inevitable, and at a significant and continual financial cost,' said Jason Spensley of the U.N. Climate Technology Centre and Network. Beaches across the area are being transformed by a number of factors: shoreline development; surges from increasingly intense storms; coastal pollution that affects marine life and crumbling coral reefs in warmer waters. 2007: just seven years ago Negril beach looked far healthier. Now it's being transformed by shoreline development,  storms, pollution and crumbling coral reefs . The changes are a particular headache for the Caribbean because of its dependence on sea-and-sand tourism - roughly 70 percent of the Caribbean's people and much of its essential infrastructure are situated along coasts. Ulrich Trotz, a science adviser for the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre believes the area is facing an existential threat. 'We don't have much time. Action now is imperative if the Caribbean is to survive as we know it,' said Trotz. Uncertain future: geologist Simon Mitchel says there is 'no doubt' hotels will be deluged in coming decades . Environmental experts and civil planners say leaders across the region need to adapt for the long term. City developers could adjust how they zone, improve enforcement of marine regulations and better plan water systems, for example. Beach front developers could be encouraged to protect dunes and anchor vegetation, better manage coastal  pollution and push construction farther back from the sea. 'We just don't seem to be prepared to do any of it. It's as if we do not see what Negril has become, what the dangers to its future are,' said Diana McCaulay, CEO of the non profit Jamaica Environment Trust. Simon Mitchell, a geologist at the island's University of the West Indies, says governments need to think further ahead. In low-lying Negril, for example, there is 'no doubt' that hotels perched along the beach will be deluged in coming decades, he said. 'We need to be looking 50 years into the future,' he said. 'We can't keep going into places with pristine beaches, immediately put in hotels and then end up with the same problem in 10 years' time because those beaches are eroding away.'","Negril on Jamaica's Western coast sees 400,000 visitors a year .

"The world's only surviving Bronze Age metropolis could disappear within 20 years unless urgent action is taken to preserve it. The 5,000 year old ruins of the ancient city of Mohenjodaro is situated in what is now the province of Sindh in southern Pakistan on the west bank of the Indus River. But the settlement has been left to crumble over the years due to government neglect, a drop in tourism and security issues within the country. The city dates back to 3000BC and was made up of homes with interconnecting rooms, court yards and roads . Experts have now warned that Mohenjodaro is in danger of corroding away completely if a rescue  plan is not drawn up immediately to save it. Officials met in Karachi last week to discuss ways of preserving it. The city dates back to 3000BC and was made up of homes with interconnecting rooms, fired brick walls, court yards, good roads, clean water and even a complex draining system. The advanced example of urban planning was incredibly complex for its time. Gold bracelets and a button which were discovered in the settlement in 1980 - the year Mohenjodaro was declared a World Heritage Site . A statue of a woman (left) and of a king priest (right) discovered in the ancient settlement . These dice are believed to date back to the Bronze Age and reveal a cultured and sophisticated civilisation living in the Indus Valley . There were separate drains for rainwater and sewage which were covered with slabs of limestone to prevent insects. Wells were built for drinking water and clay litter bins even lined the streets. Wheat and barley were stored on . raised platforms to protect them from flooding and a water cooler took . pride of place in a marketplace where people would gather. There was even a large swimming bath complete with dressing rooms - mainly used for keeping clean. Cultured: Artefacts found by archeologists in the settlement included this chess set which is now at the Karachi Museum in Pakistan . A necklace made of Carnelian beads (left) and statue known as a mother goddess both discovered on the site . Restored pottery discovered on the ancient site lines a wall near the ruins of the ancient city of Mohenjodaro . More than 40,000 artefacts have been discovered which reveal a sophisticated society of around 40,000 inhabitants living in the Indus Valley which even had its own system of law. Artefacts include gold jewellery, statues, pottery, games and even a chess set. But little is known about the appearance of men and women in Mohenjodaro. However, a seven inch high stone sculpture discovered in the lower city shows how men might have looked and dressed. The figure's beard is short and neat, . his upper lip is shaved clean, and his hair is tied with a band that . hangs down his back to his shoulder. Experts have warned that the World Heritage Site could disappear within 20 years if a rescue plan is not carried out immediately . Sir John Marshall, the director general of the Archaeological Survey of India, led the team who dug through the sand and mud to uncover the city and thousands of artefacts. But now the walls of this ancient city are crumbling from the base upwards. The salt content in the ground is eating away at the bricks which before had survived thousands of years. Hot summers, cold winters, monsoon rains and humidity have all contributed to the city's major decay. Preservation . work has been carried out since the very first excavations in 1924. Some experts believe the settlement, . which was declared a World Heritage Site in 1980, should be buried again . to stop any further decline. Dr Asma Ibrahim, a Pakistani . archeologist, told The Telegraph: 'There is no department with . expertise, no decisions taken for the last two years.

"He was arrested and fined $29,500 for shoplifting underwear from a Dillard's store. But Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle will no longer struggle for intimate garments after signing a deal with MeUndies. The 22-year-old landed the contract in a bid to atone for his crime, revealing he will donate $15,000 of the brand's apparel to children in need. Dallas Cowboys' Joseph Randle was arrested for shoplifting at a Dillard's department store in Frisco, Texas . Randle, 22, was arrested on Monday and released after posting £220 bail on Tuesday morning . 'There is no excuse for my mistake last week, and I take full responsibility for my actions,' Randle said, via ESPNDallas.com. 'I let down my coaches, teammates, and family. 'My agent and I have spent a lot of time looking for ways I can turn my situation into a learning experience for young people. 'Partnering with MeUndies allows me the opportunity to give back to others less fortunate than myself, and spread a positive message of not making the same mistake twice.' Randle, who signed a four-year, $2.35 million contract last year, was charged with Class B misdemeanour theft of underwear and cologne between the value of $50 to $500. Police attended the Dillard's store at Stonebriar Mall in Frisco, north of Dallas, at 8.17pm, after the young NFL star was detained by security staff. A police spokesman told the Dallas Morning News that Randle tried to take a pack of two black Polo underwear valued at $39.50  and a small bottle of Gucci Guilty Black cologne priced at $84.

Jackman had been the one to challenge the radio host  to run the marathon in a bid to encourage him to get healthy . 'I feel so bad mate, I could use other words, but you'd have to dump me,' Worland jested. 'I've made it and it's done now so I'm really pleased right now. I'm feeling good now, but it hurt the whole six odd hours.' Jackman also took to social media to show his pride, sharing snaps and video of the moment he embraced and cheered for his childhood friend. 'From the line to enter our kindergarten classroom… to the line at the start of the NYC Marathon. Proud of you Gus Worland,' Jackman tweeted from the finishing line. 'For you Gus Worland!!! What an effort mate': The star shared an image of his mate's medal on Instagram . Worland and Jackman have been best friends ever since they met at Pymble Public School on Sydney's Upper North Shore in the 1970s. 'The first day of school I held his hand walking into the class room,' Worland said. 'He's more like a brother to me – his mum left the family home at a reasonably young age and his dad had five kids and he needed people to look after various kids at different times. 'Jacko seemed to come to our place and stay for three or four months at a time.' Since then they've been best men at each other's weddings and godfathers for each other's children. Worland, pictured in April (left) and August (right) while training for the New York Marathon . Jackman, his best friend of 40 years, challenged him to change his lifestyle and film it for a TV show . Jackman (left circle) and Worland (right circle) played together in the Bannockburn Rovers Under  7's . The duo came up with the idea to change Worland's lifestyle, and turn it into a TV show in the process, after a long day of drinking beer and watching cricket on Boxing Day last year. 'The next morning Jacko said ""We had a brilliant time but it looks like you've been doing those days more often than you should"",' Worland told Daily Mail Australia. 'Little did I know he'd had a chat with my wife and she had said to him perhaps if you get the right moment you should bring that up.' It was a difficult discussion for the friends of 40 years but Worland knew that Jackman was right. The 45-year-old had tried various fad diets and weight loss pills over the years, but nothing had stuck. Worland, who is a breakfast radio host on Triple M, lost 30kg in six months . 'We thought we might be able to show people you can lose weight through fun and a challenge rather than just a personal trainer yelling at you,' he said. 'And I'm probably more likely to keep weight off if we do it our way than just have fun.' They signed a contract with Foxtel, who the pair had previous worked with on the An Aussie Goes series. Three separate seasons followed Worland as he immersed himself with cricket fans in England, India and the West Indies – all after a challenge from Jackman. Fast forward more than six months and Worland has lost 30kg and has finished the New York City Marathon.The first episode of Gus Worland: Marathon Man will air next Thursday November 6. But Worland, who lives with his family on Sydney's Northern Beaches, says it has been a lot of effort to get this point. The first thing he tackled was his smoking addiction, having his last cigarette on December 31 last year. The second thing he had to change was his diet. Before he started training for the marathon, his daily food intake was massive. 'For breakfast I'd have eggs and bacon with lots of toast, then mid-morning I'd have either bakery food – like a couple of cakes or sausage rolls - or I'd grab two cheeseburgers from Maccas,' he said. 'Then I'd have some sort of lunch like a chicken schnitzel roll maybe with some chips. 'In the afternoon I'd have a finger bun when I picked up the kids from school. 'Dinner would be a normal dinner of protein with veggies and salad, then later I'd have a cup of tea and a couple of rows of choccy.' But he says that is the 'old Gus'. Now he has cut out sugar and processed food, and started eating more fruit and vegetables. He still has bacon and eggs for breakfast, but he's swapped the toast for avocado or tomato. Worland training on the Coogee steps in Sydney in April, when he first started his weight loss regimen . The first episode of Gus Worland: Marathon Man will air next Thursday November 6 on Foxtel . Mid-morning he has a piece of fruit, followed by a chicken wrap or chicken salad for lunch. He has another piece of fruit in the afternoon followed by a dinner of fish or chicken with salad and veggies. And he's stopped having an after dinner snack. Worland says he's also cut down on alcohol. 'Basically I've stopped the grog, I might have a couple of beers a week,' he said. 'Before that the old Gus would have had a good filling of grog - I reckon probably one big lunch a week because of radio industry, a couple of bottles of wine and a case of beer.' Since filming started in April, Worland has also committed to a five-day-a-week exercise regimen with the help of personal trainer and nutritionist Brad Pamp. Worland and family (from left: son Jack, daughter Ella, wife Vicki and daughter Abi)  at Ayers Rock in July . Worland and wife Vicki took part in the Outback Half Marathon at Ayers Rock . 'For the first eight weeks all I did was walk, starting at 20 minutes the first week and building up to two hours,' he said. 'At the end of eight weeks I started walking for four minutes, running for one, and I'd do that for an hour. He slowly increased the number of minutes he was running until he could run for five minutes without needing a walking break. After three months of training he completed a 5km run. After four months he ran 10km. Three months in he ran a half marathon. The whole time Jackman has been talking to Worland over phone, email and Skype and encouraging him to push harder with his training. 'We talk every day pretty much – it's perfect timing as I'm driving to work because it's early afternoon New York time,' Worland said. Gus Worland, pictured training on the Coogee steps in April, ran the New York City Marathon on Sunday . Worland (pictured in early October) is confident he will be able to keep up his new, healthy lifestyle after the cameras stop rolling . 'He just fills me in on what is going on in his life, and keeps giving advice like ""Your kids are watching you, if you do this you'll set such a great example''.' Worland is also confident that he will be able to keep up his new, healthy lifestyle after the cameras stop rolling. 'The underlying thing is I'm moving and I'm eating better and if you do that you'll be feeling better,' he said. 'My family and my mates won't let me give up, and my body now rejects crappy food, it really does. 'I've said that in the past but I think this time I might have cracked it.'","Gus Worland finished the NYC marathon in six and a half hours after accepting a challenge from his best friend Hugh Jackman .

"Fans of the controversial Benefits Street television series are flocking to the run-down Birmingham road where it is filmed to take souvenir photographs of the street and its residents. James Turner Street, home to the show's controversial characters White Dee, Black Dee and Mark and Becky, has become an unlikely visitor destination as the five-part show, which ends tonight, has gripped viewers. Dozens of fans have descended on the terraced street, portrayed as being home to thieves, benefits cheats and the unemployed in the Channel 4 series. Benefits Street is filmed in James Turner Street in Birmingham and is an unlikely new tourist attraction . Jobless single mother White Dee, 42, has emerged as one of the stars of the show and now signs autographs . Residents Mark Thomas and Becky Howe, both 23, have admitted fiddling their benefits and do not work . Viewers arrive in cars and on foot to pose beside the street sign or outside the homes of the show's more notorious characters. Others wait outside the house of White Dee, the 42-year-old mother of two also known as Deirdre Kelly, who has been inundated with media offers since first appearing on Benefits Street. White Dee, so-called to distinguish her from Black Dee, who also lives on the street, is a jobless single mother who was dubbed the 'patron saint of drug users and drop-outs' when she debated on television with entrepreneur Katie Hopkins. She has welcomed tourists into her house for a cup of tea and a photograph, as have argumentative couple, benefits cheats Mark Thomas and Becky Howe. The jobless couple, both 23, live in the street with their children Callum, four, and Casey, two, and survive on state handouts of £750 a month.  They both admit to having fiddled their benefits payments, and are now trying to raise money by selling their autographs on eBay. Not all of the tourists are fans, though, and residents have complained of people shouting abuse and defacing the street signs with slogans criticising those who live there. James Turner Street, where a two-bedroom house costs £78,000 but most residents exist on handouts . Residents include alcoholic 'Fungi', left, and Black Dee (aka Samora Roberts, 32), who is facing drugs charges . But while some of the programme's stars have been happy to pose for photographs or give out autographs, some of the others living in the street, where a two-up, two-down house costs £78,000 but 90 per cent of the residents are on benefits, are fed up with their portrayal on television. One said he was longing for it to 'get back to normal', while other residents are angry at what they see as a misrepresentation of their street which is home to those with jobs and careers as well as those without. Today a Christian charity that owns a . primary school on James Turner Street said it was planning to complain . that the local childrens' education was being jeopardised by . 'rubberneckers' blocking the roads and hurling abuse at residents. Steve . Chalke, of the Oasis Academy Foundry, said he was going to complain to . Ofcom - which has received nearly 1,000 complaints about the show - . about the disruption caused to school staff and pupils. Last month, producers of the show were accused of bribing the street's residents to be filmed for Benefits Street. Salesman Smoggy (aka Stephen Smith) won viewers' hearts as he struggled to turn his life around . Residents of James Turner Street, who were not paid because it might affects their benefits claims, said they were offered alcohol and fast food by television producers who wanted to get the best possible footage. Miss Howe said: 'The film crew effectively invaded our street and were at people’s doors every morning. 'If you didn’t want to do any filming they’d go away and come back five minutes later carrying LSV energy drinks and cigarettes. 'I know for a fact that one resident who is in the show was bought cans of beer every day from the shop and was filmed drinking from it. 'Producers bought us McDonald’s meals and we were even photographed by the Google Street View car eating it outside our house.' Channel 4 refuted the allegations and said their staff were only 'helping out' by giving residents food and drink. Benefits Street had viewers gripped from the start after its first episode featured people admitting fiddling benefits payments, shoplifting, and avoiding work because they couldn't be bothered. One resident of James Turner Street, an alcoholic known as Fungi, was shown selling fake Big Issue magazines and drinking.  He has not been back to the street since the first episode was screened. Another resident, Black Dee (aka Samora Roberts), 32, is due to appear in court later this week to answer drugs charges. Tonight more than 5million people are expected to tune in at 9pm for the final episode of the show.","James Turner Street in Birmingham is unlikely new destination for visitors .

"A schoolgirl was horrified when she found a dirty grey feather in a ham, cheese and pickle sandwich she was eating for breakfast. Tanika Nadarajah was on her way to school in Tooting, south east London, when she and her mother stopped to buy breakfast from a local Tesco.

"Some of cinema's most famous lines are not what you think they are - the words have become  commonly recited misquotes as they are endlessly repeated by fans. From cinema classics Field Of Dreams to The Wizard Of Oz and Dirty Harry, characters' lines have been slightly altered over the years, meaning they are no longer remembered in their original form. One misquote from an early Disney film has become so ingrained in cinema lore that it was used as the title of another movie. Scroll down for videos of how the lines were actually said . Field Of Dreams: Kevin Costner's character actually hears the line 'If you build it, HE will come' Mirror, Mirror, the 2012 movie starring Lily Collins and Julia Roberts, appears to be named after a line from Disney’s animated version of Snow White, made in 1937. However, Snow White's evil stepmother Queen Grimhilde actually says something else entirely. Instead of: ‘Mirror, mirror on the wall,’ the queen says: ‘Magic mirror on the wall.’ The signature quote from another children’s favorite, The Wizard of Oz, is also frequently misquoted. When Dorothy lands in Oz, most movie-goers believe that Judy Garland's character turns to her little dog and says: ‘Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.’ Empire Strikes Back: When Luke Skywalker believes Darth Vader has killed his father, Vader corrects him, but not using his name. The correct line is: 'No. I am your father' THE WIZARD OF OZ . Misquote: 'Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.' Line: 'Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.' FIELD OF DREAMS . Misquote: ‘If you build it, they will come.’ Line: 'If you build it, he will come.' THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK . Misquote: 'Luke, I am your father.' Line: 'No. I am your father.' DIRTY HARRY . Misquote: 'Do you feel lucky, punk?' Line: ‘You've got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?’ If fact, the line that appeared in the script actually runs: ‘Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.’ Set not far from Kansas in the state of Iowa, Field of Dreams, the Oscar-nominated 1989 film starring Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster, is another commonly misquoted movie. Most people think that the character Terence Mann, played by James Earl Jones, tells Kevin Costner’s Ray Kinsella: ‘If you build it, they will come.’ In fact, the line is something slightly different: ‘If you build it, he will come.’ James Earl Jones is also behind another of cinema's most common misquotes when he provided the voice for Darth Vader in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. A slightly raspier version of Jones's voice is often believed to say: ‘Luke, I am your father.’ Actually, Jones’ character Darth Vader . says: ‘No. I am your father,’ when Luke Skywalker mistakenly accuses . the character of killing his father. In . Dirty Hairy, Clint Eastwood doesn’t say: 'Do you feel lucky, punk?' when he makes his final approach to an injured criminal as is commonly . believed. Instead, the line goes: ‘You've got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?’ Which might be a good question to ask yourself the next time you feel inclined to quote from your favorite movie script. The Wizard Of Oz: When Dorothy lands in Oz, most people believe she said: 'Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.' If fact, the line runs: 'Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.' Dirty Harry: The famous line from Clint Eastwood's 1971 film 'Do you feel lucky, punk?' is actually erroneous .","Classic lines from Field Of Dreams, The Wizard Of Oz and The Empire Strikes Back are often incorrectly recited ."
"A  shopkeeper facing energy bills of £5,000 hanged himself just moments after three British Gas staff turned up at his store to cut off the electricity supply, an inquest heard. Anthony Waters, 48, was serving customers at his family run mini market in Little Horton, West Yorkshire, when the workmen arrived at 9am in a convoy of three vehicles with a warrant saying his shop was going to be 'de-energised'. Despite his pleas that he could raise £1,000, one of the gasmen said it was not enough and then plunged the store into darkness after ignoring threats by Mr Waters that he would take his own life. Anthony Waters (pictured) hanged himself moments after three British Gas staff turned up at his store to cut off the electricity supply, an inquest heard . Mr Waters was serving customers at his family run mini market (pictured) in Little Horton, West Yorkshire, when the workmen arrived in a convoy of three vehicles with a warrant saying his shop was going to be 'de-energised' Shortly afterwards, as the workmen called police from outside to alert them about Mr Waters' claims, he closed the shop and hanged himself. Today the energy giant was condemned by Mr Waters' family after a coroner said he had been 'put on the spot' by company staff. The tragedy occurred in the same month that regulator Ofgem said the big six energy firms - including British Gas - were set to double profit margins over the next year. Mr Waters' father Keith, 87, said: 'I think Anthony felt he had let us down. He was pushed to the point of desperation by a big corporation bullying him because it couldn't give a bit of leeway to a single man struggling and he was pushed over the edge. I think it is disgusting. 'I'm sure they could have arranged for another payment scheme if things were getting that bad. I don't understand why British Gas had to send three men to his shop without any warning. 'It was a bit heavy-handed and these companies forget the human side of things. Where is their humanity? Anthony Waters (pictured) told the gasmen he could raise £1,000 but was told this was not enough before his store was plunged into darkness, an inquest heard . 'Since they switched off the electricity we have had row upon row of stock going to waste and to add insult to injury we've had two break-ins because the burglar alarm was rendered useless when the electricity was cut off. 'I know it must have been difficult for those three British Gas men and they were only doing their job but when Anthony said the words he did and stated his intention, why did no one take heed? Is money worth as much as a life?' The inquest in Bradford heard a team of three British Gas employees, including a locksmith and engineer turned up on July 22 in a convoy of three vehicles at Mr Waters' mini market. Warrant officer David Pickard, one of the British Gas team members, said in a statement: 'We attend residents and businesses who have not paid their bills. We either collect the outstanding debt or ""de-energise"" the electricity supply. 'I went into the shop and Mr Waters was serving customers. He confirmed he was Anthony Waters. I tried to explain why I was there but it was difficult because he was trying to serve customers. We began to talk inside the shop. Mr Waters' father Keith, pictured holding one of the British Gas bills, has hit out at the company after a coronor ruled his son was 'put on the spot' by company staff . 'I explained why we were there - if he did not pay there was a warrant and his supply would be de-energised. 'I spoke to a lady who had access to the computer and she confirmed that the debt was still outstanding. They give the final say on whether we de-energise or walk away. She confirmed we had to de-energise if the debt was not paid in full. 'He began to talk to them and then he handed the phone to me. I think he rang a close friend or relative to get money. He said he could get about £1,000 but I said that was not enough. 'He clearly felt he should have been given more time to pay. He said ""You will have to do it,"" referring to us de-energising the electricity supply. 'But he was getting more anxious and said ""I will hang myself"". I thought it was just a throw away comment, an idle threat. In my line of work I hear people say it quite regularly and think nothing of it.' Mr Waters pulled the window shutters down and told staff to go home and told British Gas to ""go ahead."" Anthony Waters, pictured centre with his father Kieth, left, and mother Beryl, right, was heard to say 'I will hang myself' after British Gas staff 'de-energised' his store . Mr Waters senior had set up Waters Mini-Mart (pictured) in 1969 with a view to leaving it to his son . The inquest was told how he was then heard to repeat 'I will hang myself' before adding 'I have got the rope ready you know. I would have been 49 next month.' Mr Pickard said: 'Again I just thought this was idle threats and trying to make us feel sorry for him so we would not go ahead. He kept trying to hurry us up saying ""I want you to leave now"". 'His window shutters were down and the door inside was shut. I thought Mr Waters was still inside but I hadn't been able to watch the door while I was on the phone to the police.' Police arrived and asked the British Gas locksmith to pick the lock to gain entry. Officers found Mr Waters' body in a warehouse at the back of the store. Mr Waters senior had set up Waters Mini-Mart in 1969 with a view to leaving it to his son. But the family ran into financial difficulties after building a large property portfolio on the back of a £300,000 bank loan. When  Anthony, who was single, took over this year, three of the businesses they ran had to temporarily shut down in an attempt to consolidate the debts. A coroner recorded a verdict of suicide adding that there was evidence Mr Waters (pictured) had been 'put on the spot' by British Gas workers . The mini market reopened in February but hit difficulties when the bank called in the debts on the family's other business interests, the inquest heard. Mr Waters said: 'Earlier this year we thought we were doing really nicely and that things were on the mend. Sales were going up, It was great and then suddenly the bank said three of our properties would have to be sold to pay for the others - and that's when it all started to go wrong. 'British Gas were already charging us thousands for the shop even though it had been shut down for a while. How they could have accumulated a bill like that when it was closed I don't know. 'Anthony was paying his current British Gas bill so as far as we were concerned they had come around to collect money for a bill he shouldn't have been paying.' Recording a verdict of suicide Bradford Coroner Oliver Longstaff said: 'There is considerable evidence in my mind that Anthony Waters was under a considerable amount of stress with the financial difficulties of the business. 'There is evidence that he was put on the spot by the British Gas officers. He closed the shop and sent people away. Anthony Waters (pictured with his mother Beryl and father Keith) had 'done his best for a long time to keep the family business', the coroner said . The family of Mr Waters say vandals targeted the shop in Little Horton, West Yorkshire, after the power was cut off . 'He took himself to the rear of the building where he took his own life. There was no evidence that he was suffering from any psychological conditions or that his judgement was impaired by use of alcohol. 'He was a man who had done his best for a long time to keep the family business which he took great pride in, in good health for as long as he could. He realised he couldn't do that for any longer and took a view that all that was left was to end his life.' After the case Leonie Edwards of British Gas said, 'We were very saddened by the death of Mr Waters and we would like to express our sincere sympathies to his family. 'British Gas employees followed our established procedures and contacted the police when they were onsite and stayed there until they arrived. 'Disconnection is always a last resort and this usually follows a series of discussions including payment plans and support from organisations like Business Debtline to try and resolve the issue.'","Anthony Waters was serving customers when British Gas staff turned up .

"Trying to reduce the time their children spend on laptops and smartphones is a constant worry for parents. But perhaps they should encourage them to remain glued to their devices, as computer scientists have emerged as the top-earning graduates. According to figures of graduate salaries, computer scientists from Oxford receive the most lucrative pay packets after graduating, earning an average of £43,895 six months after leaving university. Computer scientists from Oxford University (pictured), have emerged as the top-earning graduates . Google co-founder Larry Page (pictured) studied computer science at Stanford University - he is now worth $31.7billion . Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg read computer science at Harvard and is now worth $33.1b . The figure is almost four times that of graduates in drama, dance and cinematics from Essex University, the lowest earners on just £11,963. Professor Michael Wooldridge (pictured) attributed the success of his graduates to an 'uncompromising insistence on mathematical clarity' Famous graduates of computer science include Google co founder, Larry Page, and Facebook co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg. Professor Michael Wooldridge, head of the computer science department at Oxford University, told Sian Griffiths, of the Sunday Times: 'Ultimately, our students are trained to think clearly, rigorously and deeply about complex problems.' 'Computers are the future and computer science courses command a salary premium', agreed Professor Alan Smithers, of Buckingham University. The tables also highlight the growing gap between the highest and lowest earning graduates and found that one in 10 had not got a job six months after leaving university. Graduates in computer science from Imperial College London and Cambridge also feature in the top 10 for earnings. Science degrees are increasingly the path to higher earnings, the figures reveal, with engineering, medicine, veterinary science and dentistry all performing well. Arts subjects fare far less well. Elsewhere, the figures show there is a significant difference in pay depending on which university students attend. Graduates in accounting and finance from Huddersfield received an average of £16,335, while students reading the same subject at Bath earned £29,588.

"Paul Nicholls believes Irish raider Champagne Fever is the horse which stands between him and a remarkable ninth King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day. The champion trainer will saddle three of the 10 entries in the £200,000 steeplechase with sponsors William Hill making his 2013 winner Silviniaco Conti 5-2 favourite to land a second victory in a race with a history of multiple winners. Last week, Champagne Fever’s trainer Willie Mullins said he was heading to Kempton with concerns that the Ruby Walsh-ridden horse lacked the necessary experience to land a first victory over three miles since his nursery days in the point-to-point field. Noel Fehily rides Silviniaco Conti following his King George VI Steeple Chase win at Kempton Park last year . Trainer Paul Nicholls fears that Champagne Fever is the only thing that stands between him and another win . But, after watching the grey’s victory in the two-and-a-half-mile Clonmel Oil Chase last month, Nicholls, who also saddles 6-1 shot Al Ferof and 50-1 outsider Wonderful Charm, senses where the danger lies. He said: ‘Silviniaco Conti is last year’s winner so deserves to be favourite but when I saw Champagne Fever win I thought that is the one to beat in the King George. I have always had the feeling Ruby thought that as well. He just looked impressive.’ Nicholls also believes Sam Twiston-Davies-ridden Al Ferof, beaten just under 15 lengths when third last year and another seeking a first win over three miles, is likely to be much closer to Silviniaco Conti on Friday. Paul Nicholls will be saddling three of the ten entries in this year's steeplechase at Kempton on Boxing Day . The trainer, who has also won the race five times with Kauto Star and twice with See More Business, added: ‘Al Ferof probably produced a career best to win the Amlin Chase at Ascot last month and the form has worked out well. ‘He obviously has to prove he can win over three miles but he is a year older and there is stamina in his pedigree.’ Both geldings have benefited from treatment for gastric ulcers which Nicholls believes affected their performances last season. ‘When Conti was fourth in the Gold Cup, he wandered under pressure as if something was hurting and even when he won at Aintree he pulled himself up from the last fence,’ said Nicholls. ‘We thought we were missing something, gastro-scoped him and he had grade four ulcers. ‘Whether it is a footballer, athlete or racehorse you are always trying to eliminate problems.’ Willie Mullins' Champagne Fever (left) won well in the two-and-a-half-mile Clonmel Oil Chase last month . Five of the King George line-up were in last year’s race with Cue Card second, Dynaste, who finished lame, fifth and Menorah pulled up. Two fences out, Cue Card still looked the winner but he was ultimately outstayed by Silviniaco Conti as his stamina kicked in. Jockey Noel Fehily will no doubt attempt to make that happen again on an eight-year-old whose ability to stay — so important because the tempo of the race is invariably demanding — was also crucial as he landed a second Betfair Chase at Haydock last month. It should prove the difference again. Having twice been beaten in the race it is hard to see why Cue Card should make it third time lucky but Dynaste, a creditable third in the Betfair Chase, has frame claims for trainer David Pipe and jockey Tom Scudamore. The Menorah of 12 months ago would have no chance but he has proved a different proposition this season. A win in last month’s Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby was followed by a two-length second to Silviniaco Conti in the Betfair Chase. Silviniaco Conti clears the last to win the 2013 King George but Nicholls sees that Champagne Fever is a danger . The drying ground conditions is a positive, as they are for his Peterborough Chase-winning stable-mate Wishfull Thinking, plus Menorah has won on all his three runs at Kempton. He should give Tom O’Brien, standing in for suspended Richard Johnson, an exciting ride. With Jamie Moore having failed to recover from the shoulder muscle injury he sustained in a fall at Cheltenham on December 13, trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies has called up stable conditional jockey Ryan Hatch to ride Double Ross. But, admirable though the eight-year-old is, he has looked a few pounds short of this level and the same applies to Nicholls’s third string, Wonderful Charm. Johns Spirit steps up in grade after some great runs in handicaps but with his trainer Jonjo O’Neill struggling badly with his form for most of the last two months, it is hard to see him figuring in the finish.","Silviniaco Conti is favourite to win the King George Chase on Boxing Day .

"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden warned Saturday that imposing a travel ban to the countries known to be dealing with an Ebola outbreak could make the problem worse, as it would cut off the affected areas from receiving necessary medical aid. Such was the case recently in Liberia - where the Ebola death toll is nearing 3,500 people - when African Union aid workers were trying to get into the country, Frieden said. 'Their ability to get there was delayed by about a week because their flight was canceled and they were stuck in a neighboring country,' Frieden told a press conference Saturday, according to The Hill. 'In terms of the entry process, we really need to be clear that we don't inadvertently increase the risk to people in this country by making it harder for us to respond to the needs in those countries, by making it harder to get assistance in and therefore those outbreaks would become worse, go on longer, and paradoxically, something that we did to try and protect ourselves might actually increase our risk.' Scroll down for video . 'Sealing off the the country could make it worse': U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said fighting the source of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa would be the best way to control it . Frieden believes the best way to control the outbreak of the deadly virus is to fight it from the source in West Africa, not stop people who may or may not be infected from coming into the country. 'Though we might wish we can seal ourselves off from the world, there are Americans who have the right of return and many other people that have the right to enter this country,' he said. As the number of potential Ebola patients continues to rage in the United States, Frieden stressed there remains only one confirmed case - Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas. 'We have definitely seen an increase in the number since this patient was diagnosed - that is as it should be,' Frieden said. 'We have already gotten well over 100 inquiries for possible patients - this one patient has tested positive. 'We expect we will see more rumors, concerns, possibilities of cases. Until there is a positive test that's what they are, rumors and concerns.' Federal officials confirmed Saturday that the suspected Ebola patient at the District of Columbia's Howard University hospital did not have the disease, Fox News reported. Similar scares in New Jersey and Washington D.C. also tested negative for Ebola. Infected: Eric Thomas Duncan, the first confirmed case of Ebola in the United States, arrived in Dallas from Liberia on September 25. He was mistakenly turned away from a hospital before returning two days later via ambulance. Duncan is now reportedly in a critical condition . Duncan was mistakenly sent home by a Dallas hospital last week, even after telling doctors he had recently visted Liberia. He returned via ambulance two days later and is now said to be in a crtical condition, according to Fox. About 50 people in Texas have been marked as the most at-risk of contracting Ebola after coming into contact with Duncan, the CDC told The Washington Post. Nine of them are considered high-risk, and four have been quarantined.","Fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa would be the most effective, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said .

"The Football League has agreed to put Leeds owner Massimo Cellino's ban on hold until after his appeal has been heard. Cellino had been ordered to step down from the club's board of directors on December 29 after the League disqualifed him under its 'owners' and directors' test' earlier this month following a thorough investigation. But the governing body has now reached agreement with the Italian's legal team and he will be allowed to stay on as a club director while his appeal is being considered. Massimo Cellino has faced an ongoing battle to convince the Football League he is fit to run Leeds United . The Italian bought 75% of the club in February, but the move was initially blocked a month later . Leeds fans were opposed to the 58-year-old's involvement, but some have been won over since . A League statement read: 'The Football League and the legal representatives of Leeds United President, Massimo Cellino, have agreed the process and date of Mr. Cellino's appeal against the decision by The Football League Board that he is subject to a disqualifying condition under its Owners' and Directors' Test. 'The matter will be heard by a Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by Tim Kerr QC on January 15. 'The original decision required Mr. Cellino to resign as a director of Leeds United and cease acting as a 'relevant person' in line with Football League regulations by December 29. February 2014: Leeds United announce that Massimo Cellino has agreed a 75% buy-out of the club, subject to approval from the Football League. March 2014: A court in Sardinia finds Cellino guilty of illegally evading import duty. Ordered to pay a €600,000 fine after being convicted of failing to pay €388,500 in tax on a yacht seized by Italian police and customs officials in June 2013. Back in England, Football League vote unanimously to block Cellino's takeover of Leeds and disqualify him from owning the club after failing their owners and directors test. April 2014: Cellino wins his appeal the decision, with his Eleonora Sports company completing the purchase of a 75 per cent stake in Leeds from Gulf Finance House Capital. June 2014: Cellino agrees to sell Cagliari to Italian company Fluorsid for an undisclosed fee. October 2014: Cellino's court trial in Italy for tax evasion for allegedly failing to pay import duty of around £75,000 on a second yacht is delayed after the judge decided to step down due to a conflict of interest. December 2014: The Football League announce that Cellino has again been disqualified from owning the club after they received detailed evidence from the Italian court that convicted him of tax evasion on his second yacht. 'The League has agreed to defer that deadline until two days after the handing down of the final decision of the PCC. 'As a consequence, the parties have agreed that if Mr Cellino is unsuccessful in his appeal, any disqualification period will be extended by an amount equivalent to the length of time between December 29 and the deferred deadline. 'The parties have agreed to make no further comment prior to the hearing of the PCC on January 15.' Cellino was disqualified from being owner of Leeds on December 1 when the governing body announced he had failed its 'owners' and directors' test.' Cellino had successfully appealed against the League's decision to block his takeover of Leeds in April, but after receiving further evidence from the Italian court that convicted him of tax evasion in March, the governing body ruled he was not fit to continue as the club's president. The League ruled the 58-year-old would be able to resume in his role at Elland Road on March 18 when his conviction is spent under UK law. Cellino, currently in Miami, announced he was prepared to stand down on December 29 to safeguard Leeds from further sanctions. This latest development means Cellino will continue in his role of club president throughout the January transfer window, while the appeal verdict is scheduled for three weeks after his hearing.","Italian owner Massimo Cellino is being investigated by the Football League .

"David Cameron is contemplating sending his eldest daughter to an inner-city comprehensive so she can receive a 'normal education' David Cameron is contemplating sending his eldest daughter to an inner-city comprehensive so she can receive a 'normal education'. Mr Cameron, who had a privileged education at Eton College, has reportedly visited several state schools in the capital in his quest to find a suitable secondary school place for 10-year-old Nancy. The Prime Minister is understood to have visited The Grey Coat Hospital Church of England School, an all-girls comprehensive three-quarters of a mile from Downing Street, according to the Telegraph. Chief whip Michael Gove famously chose Grey Coat Hospital school for his daughter Beatrice's secondary education while he was education secretary. Mr Cameron and his wife also visited Holland Park School – one of the first comprehensives in the UK – earlier this week, according to the Times. The school is usually more associated with Labour grandees such as the late Tony Benn and also has up to six former pupils who have either left Britain to  become Islamic jihadists in the Middle East or were linked to Islamic terrorism. Despite being in two of the wealthiest boroughs in the capital, both schools are described as 'ethnically diverse' and have intakes from some of London's most deprived areas. The Grey Coat Hospital Church of England school - the local secondary school to Number 10 - has two-thirds of pupils from 'a wide range of minority ethnic backgrounds'. Nancy and Beatrice Gove attended the same primary school in Kensington, central London and it is thought Mr Cameron has been discussing his decision with Mr Gove. Mrs Cameron - who was educated at Marlborough College - has also reportedly told friends she is keen for Nancy to have a 'normal education'. A friend told the paper: 'Her children's lives are abnormal enough. Being in a state school is a nice antidote to that. 'You get to meet normal children from normal houses whose fathers don't go off and spend the weekend with Angela Merkel.' Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister is understood to have visited The Grey Coat Hospital Church of England Comprehensive School (left), an all-girls comprehensive where Michael Gove (right) sent his daughter Beatrice . Despite its proximity to Number 10, The Grey Coat Hospital Church of England school has two-thirds of pupils from 'a wide range of minority ethnic backgrounds' In its latest Ofsted report, published in 2009, the school was rated as 'outstanding' - the top ranking given by the education watchdog. Grey Coat's intake is described as 'diverse with two thirds of students from a wide range of minority ethnic groups, of which the largest are groups with Black African or Black caribbean heritage'. It adds that 'one third of students speak a first language other than English but very few are at an early stage of learning English.' The 12-page admissions criteria describes how each of the 151 place for Year 7 students is decided upon. According to the criteria, 15 of the 151 places will be awarded to girls with an aptitude for languages; 80 to practising Church of England families and 28 to 'Churches Together' faiths. Governors allocate 25 per cent of the places to girls of above- average ability, 50 per cent to those of average ability and 25 per cent to students of below-average ability. Mr and Mrs Cameron are also considering Holland Park, one of the first comprehensives in the UK, which has up to six former who have left Britain to became Islamic jihadists in the Middle East or were linked to Islamic terrorism . The remaining 28 places will go to children with siblings at the school, and girls living in the surrounding parishes. But the school has been criticised in the past for being an 'elite' state school. After Mr Gove announced his daughter would become a pupil there, research by the Fair Admissions Campaign found 14 per cent of children are eligible for free school meals, compared with an average of 33 per cent locally. It also claimed it was in the 'top 1 per cent of the least socio-economically inclusive secondary schools in England'. Michael Gove’s daughter Beatrice won a place at Grey Coat Hospital School earlier this year, making him the first Conservative education secretary to send his child to a state secondary. George Osborne, the chancellor, removed his children from a state primary to send them to a private prep school. David Willets, the universities and science minister, also caused controversy when opted for private schools Godolphin and Latymer and St Paul’s. When Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he attracted controversy by sending his children to the Roman Catholic London Oratory school. Critics said it selected by parental interview, which favoured the professional middle classes. In addition, he and his wife, Cherie, used teachers from the independent Westminster school to give his sons Euan and Nicky extra tuition. The Prime Minister has constantly had to battle sceptics who feel his education at Eton College makes him ill-equipped to represent ordinary voters. And Mrs Cameron is the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield – a landowner descended from Charles II. She attended the fee-paying Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where the Duchess of Cambridge was also educated. But her time studying fine arts at the University of the West of England in Bristol apparently convinced Mrs Cameron that her children would benefit from exposure to people of different backgrounds. The move would see Mr Cameron become the first Tory Prime Minister to send his child to a state school while in Downing Street. Other options are thought to include St Marylebone School in central London and Lady Margaret School in Parsons Green, west London. Mr Cameron has now visited Holland Park School in Kensington - dubbed the 'Eton of Comprehensives' - twice, including at an open day this week. The school counts Hollywood actress Anjelica Huston and Mr Benn’s children among its alumni. With a catchment area including some of the wealthiest homes in the capital, around 60 per cent of pupils at Holland Park come from ‘a wide range of ethnic backgrounds’, according to Ofsted, and speak English as a second language. Six former pupils of the school have travelled to Syria, three of whom have been killed in fighting. One appeared on a video in the summer appealing for more recruits from the UK to join Islamic State’s ‘golden era of jihad’; one woman was found guilty in August of fundraising for terrorism and her female co-defendant, who was in the same year as her at Holland Park, was cleared of the same offence. Mr Cameron has spoken openly in the past about his plans to send his children to state schools, . During a question and answer session at the John Cabot Academy in Bristol in November 2012, Mr Cameron said: ‘I would like my children to go to state schools, that’s my intention, and I think what’s happening in the state school system is really exciting. ‘What we’re seeing is something we should have seen years ago which is the flowering of more choice, more competition, more diversity and crucially higher standards. I want my children to be part of that and I’m very heartened by what is happening.’ A Number 10 spokesman said: 'As with other parents at this time of year, the Prime Minister and Mrs Cameron are looking at various schools for their daughter to go to next September.'","PM reportedly toured The Grey Coat Hospital Church of England school .

Explorer Bear Grylls, celebrated ballerina Darcey Bussell, Jonathan Ross, presenters Davina McCall, Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, London mayor Boris Johnson, the Chelsea football team, and fashion designers Matthew Williamson, Christopher Kane and Rankin have all also committed to the project. The tourism initiative is in celebrating of the Paddington film release, in cinemas on 28 November . Sherlock's Benedict Cumberbatch and Oscar winner Nicole Kidman will likewise show off their design talent . Hugh Bonneville spoke about his involvement: 'Paddington is an explorer - this trail is a wonderful way of bringing this to life and I hope it makes people look at London with fresh eyes. 'I am delighted to have been asked to design one of the bears and have created an ode to Paddington's favourite preserve. I can't wait for people to see it.' The first of the designs have just been revealed: ‘Paddington Bear’ by creator Michael Bond, ‘Paddington Shakesbear’ by Michael Sheen, ‘Paddington Sparkles’ by The Saturdays' Frankie Bridge and ‘Paddingtonscape’ by artist, Hannah Warren. 'It is such a privilege to be designing a statue for The Paddington Trail, especially as it is raising money for the NSPCC – a charity I’m proud to support,' Michael Sheen said of his design, 'Paddington Shakesbear.' Pictured (L-R): 'Paddington Shakesbear' by Michael Sheen, 'Paddington Bear' by creator Michael Bond, 'Paddington Sparkles' by The Saturdays' Frankie Bridge, and 'Paddingtonscape' by artist Hannah Warren . 'I am delighted to have been able to create Shakesbear and combine my love of the bear with my passion for the bard!' The trail will be set up beginning 4 November until the end of December. It will encompass museums, parks, shops, and iconic landmarks, all of which are inspired by Paddington's adventures in his favourite city. An artist puts the final touches on Michael Bond's classic Paddington bear statue creation . Locations will be as far spread out as Heathrow to the west through to the O2 in the east, including The Royal Opera House, Museum of London, Horse Guards Parade, the Museum of Childhood, and of course, Paddington Station. The trail will end in Selfridges, where a selection of miniature statues and a dedicated Paddington concept store will be on offer to shoppers. The Selfridges Paddington Curiousity Shop will raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the statues themselves will likewise be auctioned off later in the year to raise money for a variety of charities. The cast of Paddington is keen to be involved in the initiative, which supports the NSPCC charity . Actor Hugh Bonneville says his creation is 'an ode to Paddington's favourite preserve' Paddington's origins date back several decades to when his creator, Michael Bond, bought a small bear from Selfridges on Christmas Eve 1956, as a present to his wife, and named him after the nearest railway station to which they lived. In Michael Bond's subsequent tales, the bear finds himself alone in the big, unfamiliar city before being taken in by the Brown family. It's only then that he sets out to fully explore his newly adopted town.

"Monarch butterflies are famous for migrating from the U.S. and Canada to Mexico for the winter. However, researchers have been baffled by how the tiny insects can manage such a feat. Now, a new DNA analysis say specially adapted muscles are the key. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of Monarch butterflies line a tree trunk on the Cerro del Campanario in Mexico: Researchers who carried out a DNA analysis say the species originated in North America. The 3,000-mile (4,800-km) mass migration of monarch butterflies in North America is one of the insect world's fantastic feats. Millions embarking on the arduous journey from as far north as Canada down into Mexico and the California coast each autumn. The number of migrating monarchs has plummeted in recent . years. Researchers said while an estimated one billion monarch . butterflies migrated to Mexico in 1996, that number stood at . about 35 million this past winter. Threats to them include . habitat loss due to human activities, pesticides that kill . milkweed and climate change, experts say. Monarch butterflies living east of the Rocky Mountains spend their winters in Mexico to escape the cold weather while those west of the Rockies spend winters on the California coast before returning home in the spring. Scientists say their orange color tells potential predators . they taste awful and are toxic to eat thanks to chemicals from . the milkweed plants that nourish them in their larval state. The study also suggests the species itself also started out in North America some 2 million years ago. DNA from 80 monarchs sampled from the Americas and as far away as Europe and Australia points to a North American origin, maybe in the southern United States or northern Mexico. Researcher Marcus Kronforst of the University of Chicago said monarchs were widely thought to have evolved in South or Central America instead. But Kronforst also said scientists had thought the monarch arose from a non-migrating ancestor. But the new study concludes the ancestor did migrate. Researchers pinpointed a single gene related to flight . muscle efficiency that plays a major role in the monarch . butterfly's migration. Their study, published in the journal Nature, also . identified the gene behind the butterfly's striking . orange-and-black coloration. 'I find it amazing that these little butterflies live for . months and fly thousands of miles to perform this annual . migration,' said one the researchers, University of Chicago . professor of ecology and evolution Marcus Kronforst. 'Our study shows that monarchs have been doing this every . year for millions of years. There is nothing else like this on . the planet,' Kronforst added. The number of migrating monarchs has plummeted in recent . years. Kronforst said while an estimated one billion monarch . butterflies migrated to Mexico in 1996, that number stood at . about 35 million this past winter. Migrating Monarch Butterflies on a Eucalyptus Tree: A gene related to collagen, the main ingredient in connective tissue, is  essential for flight muscle function. Threats to them include . habitat loss due to human activities, pesticides that kill . milkweed and climate change, experts say. While mainly a North American species, monarch populations . also can be found in Central America, South America and . elsewhere. Those outside North America do not migrate. The researchers carried out genome sequences on 92 monarch . butterflies from around the world including non-migratory ones . as well as on nine butterflies from closely related species. To . study the genetic basis for migration, they compared the genetic . blueprint of migratory monarchs to those that do not migrate. 'One gene really stood out from everything else in the . genome,' Kronforst said. It was a gene related to collagen, the main ingredient in . connective tissue, that was essential for flight muscle . function. The researchers were surprised to find the gene was . less active, not more active, in migratory butterflies. So . rather than making them big, powerful fliers the gene favored . enhanced flight efficiency. 'An analogy might be the difference between marathon runners . (migrating butterflies) and sprinters,' Kronforst said. Shuai Zhan, a biologist at the Shanghai Institutes for . Biological Sciences, said the study determined that the species . originated in North America, contradicting the hypothesis that . monarchs evolved from tropical ancestors. Adult monarch butterflies boast wings that are orange with . black veins and white spots along the outside edges. Their . wingspan is about 4 inches (10 cm) and their bodies are black. Scientists say their orange color tells potential predators . they taste awful and are toxic to eat thanks to chemicals from . the milkweed plants that nourish them in their larval state.

"Older homeowners with interest-only mortgages could be told by their banks to take out a lifetime loan or move out of their property. People in their 50s and 60s who cannot pay off their debt at the end of a typical 25-year interest-only mortgage may be offered a loan which they will take to their grave, to avoid repossession. Major banks are expected to offer a deal which will allow them to stay in their home and pay back only the interest, if they agree to give their house to the lender, rather than family, after their death. Scroll down for video . Spanish bank Santander will reportedly offer 'lifetime mortgages' to customers from next year in a bid to tackle the number of older homeowners who will never afford to repay their home loan . The property would then be sold and most of the proceeds would go to the lender. Spanish bank Santander will reportedly offer ‘lifetime mortgages’ to customers from next year in a bid to tackle the number of older homeowners who will never afford to repay their home loan. Industry experts said other banks were also looking at the option in a bid to tackle a mortgage ‘time bomb’ for older borrowers. Interest-only deals have lower monthly repayments because the customer is paying off only the interest, but they must then repay the full amount at the end of the fixed term. However, figures show that around half of the 130,000 interest-only mortgages which expire each year cannot be paid off in full by the homeowner. The average shortfall is around £71,000, according to figures from the Financial Conduct Authority. Many lenders are reluctant to lend to the over 60s, making it hard to get a new loan when their fixed term ends . After the homeowner died, the property would be sold and most of the proceeds would go to the lender . Around 2.8million people in the UK have interest-only mortgages but banks estimate that as many as five per cent of customers are completely unaware they are on that type of payment plan. Steve Pateman, head of UK banking at Santander, told the Financial Times: ‘We have got to find a way to help people and we can’t just put them in a sausage machine and process them so they are out of their houses in six months.’ Ros Altmann, the government’s business champion for older workers, welcomed the news, saying: ‘If you have an interest-only mortgage it effectively means the bank owns your home. ‘You don’t – that’s the reality. Lenders are trying to keep people in their homes rather than repossess them, and these new deals will ensure the bank still owns most of the house when they die.’ A lifetime mortgage is a long-term loan secured against your home which is repaid when you die. But experts warned that the loans should be considered only as a ‘last resort’ in the event that borrowers are unable to downsize to release the cash or secure a new mortgage. Many lenders are reluctant to lend to the over 60s, making it difficult for them to get a new loan when their fixed term ends. Steve Lowe, of financial services firm Just Retirement, told the Telegraph: ‘It would be unacceptable for borrowers to default to a lifetime mortgage as these type of loans require specialist advice, with families sitting down to discuss the consequences over many months before signing on the dotted line.’ There are plenty of mortgage options out there for those wanting to buy a house - Santander's new offer is just one example. In general, longer-term mortgages are becoming more popular as prospective buyers struggle to keep up with rising prices.

"Workers who lose weight will be rewarded with cash or shopping vouchers, under radical new NHS-backed plans to tackle the obesity crisis . Overweight people will be paid to lose weight, under radical new Government plans unveiled today to tackle the escalating obesity crisis . Under the NHS-backed scheme, those who shed the pounds will be rewarded with cash or shopping vouchers. Incentives could be higher or lower depending on the amount of weight a participant loses, although the amounts are still unclear. However only those with a job will qualify - and employers will also be urged to offer incentives to staff who shed pounds. Firms would receive tax breaks from the Government and would also some funding to set up slimming or exercise classes. The move is part of a wider effort to ease the strain placed on the NHS by fat patients. More than two thirds of UK adults are clinically overweight or obese and the NHS spends £5 billion a year treating obesity-related illnesses. Under the new plans, NHS staff will also be urged to 'set a national example'. Access to unhealthy foods on NHS premises will be cut and staff will have their health and wellbeing 'measured'. Around 700,000 of the NHS's 1.3 million staff are either overweight or obese . NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said earlier this year that staff must 'get our own act together' before lecturing the public on cutting down on calories. He said too many hospitals serve 'chips and burgers' to both patients and staff - and the latter face being banned from eating junk food in hospital canteens to force them to set an example to patients. Mr Stevens said workplace schemes to encourage weight loss have been largely ignored - despite success abroad. He personally managed to lose nearly 3st thanks to a weight-loss incentive scheme at his previous job, the U.S. insurance firm United Healthcare. Mr Stevens said the tax-payer funded NHS has led to a 'blind spot' about the healthcare of employees. He explained: 'Employers in many countries have developed voluntary schemes for their employees whereby, for example, you actually get cash back based on participation in Weight Watchers, or other type schemes.' Asked what sorts of rewards could be offered, he said: 'It could be shopping vouchers, it could be cash, it could be prizes.' It is understood the NHS plans to 'challenge' firms to bring in such schemes rather than offer them money. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens personally managed to lose nearly 3st thanks due to an incentive scheme at his at his previous job an a U.S. insurance firm. Dr Sally Norton (right), a weight loss surgeon, said such schemes could reduce the number of sick days taken by 50 per cent . Mr Stevens added that obesity is 'getting worse in some respects' and described the issue among children as a significant future health threat. He said: 'When your son or daughter starts primary school one in 10 children are obese. Stress at work and no time to eat nutritious meals are to blame for so many medical staff to eating badly, a survey claims. Six out of 10 nurses are too stressed to eat healthily, according to a  poll by Nursing Standard magazine. Almost 3,500 nurses, midwives and healthcare assistants from around the country took part in the research. Sixty per cent of respondents said workplace stress had a negative effect on their diet, while 79 per cent reported that a lack of breaks made it difficult to eat a healthy meal at work. Fifty six per cent said poor staffing levels had a knock-on effect on their diet. Of those polled, 73 per cent of respondents said they are heavier than they would like to be. Seventy six per cent said they feel they should be eating more healthily, while 65 per cent are trying to lose weight. A staggering 74 per cent of those who work night shifts say vending machine snacks are often the only meal option available, while only 33 per cent rated the overall quality of food on offer in their workplace as good or excellent. 'By the time they reach Year 6 that's doubled to one in five, so something is going wrong with the way in which we are keeping our children healthy and setting them up for a good start in life.' The NHS must also make a concerted effort to address the root causes of ill health - such as poor diets, alcohol consumption and smoking, a landmark report published today said, . Called the Five Year Forward View, and published by the NHS, it said: 'Put bluntly, as the nation's waistline keeps piling on the pounds, we're piling on billions of pounds in future taxes just to pay for preventable illnesses. It added: 'The future health of millions of children, the sustainability of the NHS, and the economic prosperity of Britain all now depend on a radical upgrade in prevention and public health.' Discussing the report, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted people needed to take responsibility for their own health. Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain, he said: 'The report is not saying the Government should give people cash. 'If we are going to have a sustainable health service going forward we all have to take responsibility. 'One shocking statistic is the number of children who go into primary school obese is 10 per cent and the number of primary school children who leave obese is 20 per cent. We have got to stop this.' Dr Sally Norton, a weight loss surgeon, told MailOnline that while employers might shudder at introducing such schemes, they could reduce the number of sick days taken by 50 per cent. She said: 'Employers should take note of the boom in workplace wellness programmes in the U.S. 'There, companies have seen the benefit of caring for their staff. 'UK employers lose over £20 billion a year due to absenteeism, but the costs of presenteeism - reduced productivity at work due to ill-health or poor fitness - may be three times higher. She added that being overweight or obese increases the number of sickness days taken by 50 per cent - equating to approximately £14 billion a year in lost revenue. More than two thirds of UK adults are clinically overweight or obese and the NHS spends £5 billion a year treating obesity-related illnesses. The weight loss incentive scheme was announced as part of a wider shake-up of the healthcare system in England in the next parliament proposed by NHS bosses. Other measures include tax cuts for volunteers and 'breaking down the boundaries' between GPs and hospitals. The report also includes plans to recruit an army of volunteers to help feed elderly dementia patients in hospital or care for them at home. These members of the public would then get 10 per cent off their annual council tax bill – as much as £200 depending on where they live. It does not yet specify how much voluntary work would need to be done to be entitled to this benefit or the exact tasks entailed. 'If we don’t challenge the causes of illness then the NHS is at risk of becoming bankrupt. 'While many people argue 'surely it is down to the individual to take responsibility for their own weight and wellbeing' - maybe in an ideal world. 'But this is the real world and we need to face facts.'

"Nicole Dufault, 34, is charged with the sexual of three male students and now prosecutors say they have video proof . A New Jersey high school teacher accused of sexually assaulting three 15-year-old boys . in her car and at the school where she taught was even captured on video performing oral sex on one victim. In investigating the allegations against mother-of-two Nicole Dufault, 34, authorities discovered the video and a piece of clothing she was wearing while searching her apartment. Dufault is charged with several counts of aggravated sexual . assault and endangering the welfare of a child, NJ.com reported. At least one other victim is supposedly present in the video. Essex County Assistant Prosecutor Gina Iosim unveiled new details in the case Friday as the court heard a motion to reduce Dufault's $500,000 bail on the grounds she had no criminal record and longstanding community ties. Her attorneys argued she had not even received a traffic ticket. She is awaiting trial in Essex County jail. The motion was denied by Superior Court Judge Michael R. Ravin. He said the bail was reasonable given both the severity and number of charges, and added that the video meant the likelihood of conviction was very high. Iosim also argued that Dufault had seen two prior complaints lodged against her at Columbia High School for 'lack of professionalism and her conduct.' She was accused of having 'inappropriate sexual conversations in the classroom,' in one complaint. She's also accused of lying about her work experience on her resume, listing one former employer where she never actually worked. Dufault's attorney, Timothy Smith, has not said the video and said after the hearing he could not comment without seeing the new evidence. He did say 'sometimes a video...doesn't tell the entire story . 'If the video depicts certain things happening...that doesn't mean my client's not innocent,' he told NJ.com. 'For example, she could be the victim. People are victimized by juveniles all the time.' Prosecutors . in Essex County say that Dufault, who taught language arts at Columbia . High School for nine years, assaulted the boys during the regular . academic year and summer school between 2013-2014. The . encounters allegedly took place in the teacher's car and the school's . campus in Maplewood, New Jersey, and included oral sex and intercourse, . authorities charge. She faces 12 separate charges. Each alleged victim was 15 at the time of the encounters. Dufault's two minor children have been removed from her custody. She only spoke briefly during the hearing, saying she was 'well' when asked by Ravin at the opening. Dufault has been a language arts teacher for nine years at Columbia High School (pictured) in Maplewood, New Jersey. Prosecutors say some of the assaults happened in her car and on school property and that they now have eyewitnesses to testify . Beyond the videotape, the state evidence reportedly includes statements from each of the five victims about their encounters with Dufault and witnesses that also 'witnessed her in sexual acts with others.' Smith also tried to argue that Dufault should be released from the county jail as she has a 'horrific medical condition' of a shunt in her brain because of accumulated spinal fluid that can not be properly treated while incarcerated. However Ravin did not see anything in the evidence leading him to believe the jail could not address her medical needs. 'I don't understand how someone can't pick up the clues for something like that or how any one of those kids would not have said something before now,' parent Jennifer Berkeley told WABC.  'It's really surprising to me.' 'They do background checks on the teachers, so I don’t understand,' another Columbia HS parent told CBS New York. Dufault was arrested at her home on Wedneday. One neighbor, who's known the teacher for six years, was shocked to hear about the allegations. 'Seemed like a, you know, just an average mom going to work,' Maureen Messina told CBS New York. 'Not only did she destroy her life and her children, but the boys who are involved as well,' the neighbor added. Dufault is being held at the Essex County Jail in lieu of $500,000 bail.","Nicole Dufault, 34, is charged with aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child .

"A new documentary vows to expose the dark underbelly of pig farming and allegedly contains video of pigs sleeping in their own urine, buckets of stillborn piglets and the bashing of animals with metal rods. Animal rights activist Chris Delforce has put together a documentary called Lucent which contains footage taken from inside 50 Australian piggeries and slaughterhouses. But Australia's peak body representing pig farmers said the film was not representative of what was happening in the industry. A spokesperson for the Australian Pork Network told Daily Mail Australia 'the footage does not represent Australian pork producers in a fair and equitable light.  It is skewed to totally misrepresent the industry'. Scroll down for video . A new documentary allegedly shows the mistreatment of pigs inside farms and slaughterhouses . The disturbing footage allegedly includes the confinement of pigs in cramped cages, mutilation of piglets such as cutting notches into their ears and cutting off their tails, and castration - all without the use of pain relief. 'They're confined in filthy conditions where pigs are forced to sleep in their own urine and waste,' Mr Delforce told Daily Mail Australia. 'For the sows, it's a cycle of getting impregnated, moved into sow stalls then crates where they give birth, then their piglets are taken away and they are impregnated again. 'A few cycles of that and the mortality rate increase for piglets – not always – but after two or three years they're replaced with younger pigs and sent off to be slaughtered. 'The mechanical way they are treated as units of productions is inhumane.' The activist said he wanted to make Lucent to ensure people made informed decisions about what they were buying in the supermarket. 'I would love for people to open their eyes and a lot of this unknown to a lot of people,' he said. Animal rights activist Chris Delforce compiled the documentary, Lucent, from footage he received from across Australia . He said he had received video from 50 different locations. It is claimed this pig was from Springview Piggery in NSW where the sow is believed to have been gnawing at its front paws after getting paralysis in its back legs . 'People who buy pig products don't know what's involved in bringing it into the supermarket. 'I want people to see what is happening so they can make an informed decision about what they're buying.' Mr Delforce also slammed the use of carbon dioxide chambers to render beasts unconscious before they are slaughtered. 'It's touted as the most humane method...but in footage we've received, the pigs are seen thrashing and squealing for 30 seconds,' he said. 'It's quite distressing and that's how most pigs are being stunned before they are killed.' It has been claimed this pig living inside the Dead Horse Gully piggery had its tail cut off at Golden Grove piggery across the road . Mr Delforce said the way sows were treated as 'units of productions' was inhumane . Mr Delforce said he also saw footage of people 'bashing' pigs with metal rods in a NSW slaughterhouse after the stunning process did not work properly. The activist said it was not his place to suggest a better way of slaughtering animals because he did not believe in the practice. 'It's talking about better ways to do the wrong thing,' he said. But a spokeswoman for Australian Pork Limited questioned the intentions behind Mr Delforce's documentary. She said the footage was only designed for shock value and was not about exposing animal cruelty. Lucent aims to help people make more 'informed decisions' when buying pork products in the supermarket . But Australian Pork Limited said the footage was not representative of normal practices within the industry . A spokeswoman for the organisation said the documentary was being used as a tool of 'shock' than a piece on animal rights . 'This [footage] is not normal practice for Australian pig farmers and the animal activist's desire is bring to a halt intensive animal farming for human consumption,' the spokeswoman said. 'It's not about welfare. If it was about genuine welfare of animals, film footage would not have been sat on for months - up to a year in one case - and reported immediately to the relevant authorities if it was of concern. 'The Australian Pork Industry is always reflective of how they can better connect with consumers. 'An example of this is the voluntary phase-out of sow stalls of which the industry is over 65% of the way there - this is a world first. 'If these activists were genuine in their desire for better welfare, they would work closer with this industry shoulder-to-shoulder.' Sow stalls are used for intensive pig farming where female pigs are kept in metal enclosures during pregnancy. In response to Mr Delforce's claims that the footage was taken from more than 50 farms across Australia, the APL Network told Daily Mail Australia that one producer is currently before the courts after footage from his farm was released in August, 2012. Other producers have been independently inspected by appropriate authorities with the legislative power relating to animal welfare law (RSPCA, State DPI and in some cases by the police/stock squad) and have been cleared of any violations of animal welfare law.

"Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the EU is now a 'putative superstate' Britain is 'lighting a fire under the European Union' by pledging an in-out referendum, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said today. Mr Hammond said Brussels would not be able to extinguish public demands for a vote on Britain's membership of the EU following the Prime Minister's pledge to hold a referendum by 2017. The Foreign Secretary, who remarks are among the most Eurosceptic ever made by a serving Cabinet minister, added that the EU has become a 'putative superstate' without Britain's say-so. Mr Hammond's claim came in a Commons debate today on a Tory bid to guarantee an EU referendum in law after the next election. He told the House that the issue was 'surely the most important strategic question facing this country', adding: 'We are lighting a fire under the European Union by this piece of legislation. 'We are setting off a process that politicians and governments do not have the power to stop.' He claimed that the threat of leaving the EU would give the Government 'a very powerful weapon in our armoury' when renegotiating Britain's relationship with Brussels. It came after the Tory MP launching a new legislative bid for a poll said it was time for opponents of a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union to 'put up or shut up'. Mr Neill, the MP for Bromley and Chislehurst, introduced the European Union Referendum Bill surrounded by Conservative MPs but facing only a handful of the Labour opposition MPs. The Bill is identical to one which cleared the Commons last year before getting trapped in the House of Lords and failing. Ukip's MP Douglas Carswell, who voted for the Bill while a Tory MP in the last session, was one of about a dozen MPs on the opposition benches while Mr Neill introduced the second reading. Scroll down for video . Mr Neill said: 'This Bill is about choice - it's about giving the British people a choice about something which is fundamental to our constitutional arrangements and it is fundamental to our future. 'It's a straightforward and simple Bill because the proposition of choice and a democratic principle for our people is a simple one. 'It is not a Bill about the future of our relationship with the European Union. It is not a Bill about whether we should in the long term stay in the European Union. It's a Bill about giving the people of this country a choice.' Ukip MP Douglas Carswell said he would support the Tory bid to guarantee a referendum on the European Union . Ed Miliband is facing a growing rebellion from his own party over his refusal to offer an EU referendum, it emerged this week. Thirty-four Labour MPs have now declared publicly that they disagree with their leader’s stance on an in/out vote on Britain’s place in Europe. They include Labour’s policy chief Jon Cruddas, shadow education minister Steve McCabe, and two former Labour government ministers, Keith Vaz and Andrew Smith. Meanwhile yesterday it emerged that Ed Balls, the shadow Chancellor, has suggested Labour should back the Conservatives in proposing reform of EU free movement rules. Mr Balls agreed there could no longer be a ‘free-for-all’ in terms of the migration of workers within the EU. Mr Hammond, who said he was speaking for the Conservative Party rather than the Government, stressed that the instincts of the British people should be trusted. He told the Commons: 'It is right that the British people should make the decision on whether the United Kingdom stays in the European Union or leaves altogether just as it was right that the Scottish people made the decision about their future in the UK. 'Every poll shows that whatever their view on the answer to that question the overwhelming majority want the right to decide. 'In the 41 years since the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community, in the 39 years since we last had a referendum on Europe, the EU has changed profoundly. 'It has grown enormously in its power and its reach. It's grown in its competences, its legislation has spread and the role of the European Parliament has increased almost beyond recognition at the expense of the other European institutions. 'It has morphed from a common market into a putative superstate. 'Put plainly, Europe today is very different from the Europe people voted for in 1975 and yet the British people have never been asked whether they agreed with any of these changes. 'So it should be no surprise to us that democratic support for the EU is fragile to put it diplomatically. Ever closer union has led to ever greater dissolution.' Red lines: Prime Minister David Cameron told MPs yesterday that he plans to set out 'all those issues' that will form the basis of Britain’s demands 'in the months ahead' Mr Hammond added: 'This is surely the most important strategic question facing this country today - the future of our relationship with the European Union. 'And it is a question on which we should trust the instincts of the British people.' Mr Hammond added: 'The ultimate decision of whether to or whether to stay should be for the British people. 'The key thing is when we have completed the negotiation and we bring back the result of it, it's not a question of whether we think the outcome is good enough. It's not a question of whether Parliament thinks the outcome is good enough. 'It will be a question of whether the British people think the outcome is good enough. Not only is that good for democracy it is also good for our negotiating position.' Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: 'Labour believes any judgment about a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union has to be based on what is in the national interest. 'We do not believe a Bill calling for an in/out referendum in 2017 on an arbitrary date, unrelated to the likely timetable of major treaty change, that puts jobs and investment at risk, is in our national interest. Mr Alexander also declared the recent defections of two Conservative MPs to Ukip - Mr Carswell and Mark Reckless - the 'real reason' for the timing of the Bill.","Mr Hammond said Brussels will not be able to extinguish demands for a vote .

"Australian celebrities are used to topping the charts, but now they're making the list for all the wrong reasons. Searching for pictures of certain Aussie celebrities could pose a  threat to you other than your significant other catching you in the act- typing in high profile names could actually infect your computer. A new study has revealed the names that are most likely to infect your computer with a virus, with the top five including Aussie singers Jessica Mauboy, Delta Goodrem and Keith Urban, followed by fellow singer Kylie Minogue and Aussie A-lister Russell Crowe. Internet users are being warned that viruses can be embedded within the photos or videos, exposing not just the nude photos, but their computers- to harmful malware which could download viruses or collect personal information. Jessica Mauboy topped the list of 'riskiest name', with a 12.2% risk of returning malicious software to the device it was searched from. Jessica received a profile boost over the past year, appearing on the internationally acclaimed Eurovision . Following the recent scandal over leaked nude pictures of many high-profile Hollywood stars, in which over 100 celebrities fell victim to the phone hacking scandal, internet security experts are warning that cyber-criminals are capitalising on increased traffic by loading related websites with harmful viruses, spyware, phishing and spam. 1.

In early September, an internet provider in New Zealand experienced a nationwide outage for two days after a large number of users attempted to access nude pictures of Jennifer Lawrence. The links promising the photos appeared to have hijacked the users' computers and bombarded websites with large amounts of internet traffic, causing the sites to crash. In order to avoid a repeat of what some have labelled 'breaking the internet,' internet experts have compiled a list of the most dangerous names to sneak a cyber peak at.

Marlon Wayans posted this photo to Instagram, with the caption 'Man I got the most UNRHYTHMIC WHITE WOMAN dancing next to me at the jay and bay concert... This (b****) dancing to AC/DC' Jessica received a profile boost over the past year, appearing on the internationally acclaimed Eurovision, and appearing at the handover ceremony at the Commonwealth games in Scotland. Appearing alongside international comedy man Chris O'Dowd in 2012 in the film 'The Sapphires', Jessica's international profile is on the rise, and so is her related web risk. Australian singer/songwriter and television personality Delta Goodrem is number two on the list, with an 11% chance of returning a malicious website. Delta, who is a judge on Australia's The Voice, is well-known for her highly publicised romances with Brian McFadden, Mark Philippoussis, and Jonas' Brothers Nick Jonas. Her recent interaction with Marlon Wayans on Twitter and Instagram put her profile on a global scale. After Wayans posted a photo of Delta at a Beyonce and Jay-Z concert, labeling her an 'unrhythmic white woman', she responded by tweeting a video of 'The Elaine Dance'. Her tweet scored 779 re-tweets and 1,272 favourites on the social media site, pushing her related web risk sky high. Receiving bronze is Australian singer and husband of Nicole Kidman, Keith Urban, appearing on the list for the first time with a danger risk of 10.9%. Keith and his wife have made headlines over the past year amid gossip that their marriage was struggling, and more recently, throughout the high-profile funeral of Nicole's father. The 'American Idol' panelist has recently completed a national tour for his 8th studio album 'Light the Fuse', winning a spate of awards at the Country Music Awards in 2014. Other Aussies to make the list include Kylie Minogue with 10.7% and Russell Crowe with 10.6%. On a global scale, Jimmy Kimmell, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jon Bon Jovi all pose significant risks for returning harmful software to a computer. 'The recent high-profile hacking shows just how influential celebrities are around the world, and rightly or wrongly, the incident caused a massive spike in searches, even 'breaking the internet' in New Zealand,' said Sean Duca, Chief Technology Officer for McAfee Asia Pacific. 'We know that cyber criminals will continue to gain from this by luring curious users with bogus websites, downloads and files, so we all need to be sure of the sites we can continue to trust and do everything we can to protect both our technology and our own personal information from being compromised,' he said. It remains to be seen how much internet users are willing to risk for a glimpse at a celebrity, nude or otherwise. On a global scale, Jimmy Kimmell, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jon Bon Jovi all pose significant risks for returning harmful software to a computer.","After nude celebrity photo leak, scammers are loading viruses onto websites promising pictures of A-listers .

"Infecting: David R. Wilson, 33, is accused of raping a 14-year-old girl and a two-year-old girl and infecting them with various sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, herpes, and chlamydia . A registered sex offender is charged with sexual assault and super-aggravated sexual assault of a child after raping a teen and a toddler, infecting them both with HIV, police say. David R. Wilson, 33, is accused of raping a 14-year-old girl and a two-year-old girl and infecting them with various sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, herpes, and chlamydia. The enhanced charge of super-aggravated sexual assault of a child is due to the age of the younger victim, who was just 23 months old at the time of the alleged abuse. Police began investigating Wilson in November 2013 after the toddler was taken to the hospital with STDs. Doctors had to perform reconstructive surgery on the toddler's genitals and hospital officials told police that it was clear that the toddler had to have been sexually abused, as evidenced by the presence of the STDs, according to the Chronicle. Authorities say that the toddler was sent to live with relatives as her parents live out of state and are said to have drug problems. Click2Houston reports that investigators tested four people who lived with the baby, including Wilson, and he was the only one to test positive for HIV. He also reportedly told investigators that he had been treated in the past for chlamydia, the Chronicle reports. ABC 6 reports that the 14-year-old told investigators that she and Wilson had sex one morning in his truck. She also said that the intercourse was her first time having sex and that she was pregnant with Wilson's child. Court: A charge of super-aggravated sexual assault could land Wilson with a life sentence for the rape of a two-year-old girl . It was in a cul-de-sac in north west Houston that the alleged intercourse between Wilson and the teen took place. ABC 6 reports that neighbors say the cul-de-sac is notorious for being a place where kids sneak to have sex, some even refer to it as a 'lover's lane.' The 14-year-old also tested positive for HIV, herpes and chlamydia. Additional charge?: Joel Androphy, ABC 13 legal analyst, reports that knowingly exposing someone to HIV could present a charge of its own: assault with a deadly weapon . Joel Androphy, ABC 13 legal analyst, reports that knowingly exposing someone to HIV could present a charge of its own: assault with a deadly weapon. 'It's a monster that does this kind of crime, Androphy told ABC 13. 'This guy doesn't deserve one minute less than the maximum punishment.' This isn't the first time Wilson has faced these kind of accusations. In 2004, Wilson was sentenced to four years in prison for raping someone else. Wilson was arrested Wednesday and is being held without bond at Harris County Jail, the Chronicle reports. ABC 13 reports that the enhanced charge could land Wilson with a life sentence.","David R.

"Spain coach Vicente del Bosque is feeling positive about 2015 despite the shock failure at this year's World Cup and is confident he can successfully shepherd the team through qualification for Euro 2016. Spain were dumped out in the group stage at the finals in Brazil after embarrassing defeats by Netherlands and Chile. A surprise loss to Slovakia in Euro qualification Group C also set back their bid for a place at the tournament in France in 18 months time. Spain were embarrassingly dumped out of this summer's World Cup in Brazil at the group stage . Vicente del Bosque is in good spirits as Spain hope to qualify for Euro 2016 . They also slipped to friendly defeats by France and world champions Germany as La Roja came crashing back to earth after six years of dominating the global game. 'We had a necessary period of reflection after the World Cup and both we and the federation remain on the same page,' Del Bosque told the national team's website  on Tuesday. 'We decided to carry on and I am feeling in good spirits and full of desire to fulfil my responsibilities,' added the 64-year-old, who came close to quitting after the World Cup before the Spanish soccer federation (RFEF) persuaded him to stay on.

"Lies: Christine Jordan (pictured) was convicted of perverting the course of justice and was jailed for two years . A woman cried rape after having a one night stand with someone she met on a bus - because he forgot her name when she bumped into him five days later, a court has heard. Pregnant Christine Jordan had consensual sex with window cleaner Kevin Percival but told police three days later she had been raped. Officers gave her a 'panic button' to alert them if she spotted her attacker and a few days later - when she bumped into Mr Percival in a bar - she activated it after her one night stand forgot who she was, the court was told. Cambridge Crown Court heard how 25-year-old Jordan told police he had followed her home and forced his way into her flat demanding sex. Jordan, who is now pregnant with twins by another man, was convicted of perverting the course of justice and was jailed for two years yesterday. Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Howard slammed her false claim 'a tissue of lies'. He said: 'Because rape is such a repulsive crime false allegations of rape can have serious consequences. Most obviously for the innocent man who has been falsely accused. 'But it also has the consequence that you think genuine claims may be false. There is an enormous affect on probable convictions in genuine complaints. 'These are the reasons why the offence you have committed is so serious. It undermines the whole principles of justice in relation to an offence which is a repulsive crime. 'Your false claim in this case, made three days after the incident, was a complete tissue of lies. I have to take into account the gravity of the offence.' The court heard Jordan met 27-year-old Mr Percival and his friend Alex Wallace, 31, a serving infantry signalman, on a bus after a night out in Cambridge in January 2011. The men had taken the bus from the Grand Arcade in Cambridge after having at least five pints of beer in the city centre. They went to an off-licence when they got off the bus in Fen Ditton with Jordan and bought beers and vodka to have at her flat. Jordan cried rape after Kevin Percival forgot her name when they bumped into each other in the Blue Lion pub, in Fen Ditton . Speaking out: The victim's mother Merle Percival (pictured) said the allegations had destroyed her son . But Mr Percival told the court she . gave him 'an evil look' when they met at the Blue Lion pub in Fen Ditton . five days later and he could not remember her name. Within minutes police arrived to arrest him on suspicion of rape and he was held in custody overnight. Jurors were told that CCTV footage from the bus, shop and pub proved the victim's account to be true. Jordan, . from Fen Ditton, Cambridgeshire, made no comment in her first police . interview but in her second interview she admitted that the victim's . recollection was fair. She admitted to the court she had lied about an attacker forcing himself into her flat, but said she thought police would not believe she had been raped if they knew she agreed for the men to come home with her. Nicola Devas, prosecuting at a previous hearing, told the court Jordan invented the claim because he could not remember her name. She said: 'The hope of seeing him was the reason for going down there. He accepted he could not remember her name. Is that why she phoned 999? 'The defendant has lied and lied and lied and she has been caught out in these lies.' She was found guilty of perverting the course of justice by a unanimous jury at Cambridge Crown Court in less than two hours. Judge Haworth added: 'You alleged that a man had followed you home from the bus stop. That as you opened the front door he had forced inside of that door and raped you. As you described it, it was a horrific crime. 'You were placed in a motel and given all the care and treatment that a rape victim is entitled to, but you were not entitled. 'You were given a panic alarm. You went down to the pub where you knew he was a regular visitor and you pressed the panic alarm. Police arrived and he was arrested.' Jordan had met Mr Percival and a friend of his on the bus and invited them to carry on drinking . Jordan, who is pregnant with twins and will now give birth behind bars, maintained throughout her trial that she had said 'no' halfway through sex but Kevin had ignored her. Judge Haworth added: 'That was the second lie that you maintained and the jury rejected.' Gary Rutter, defending, said Jordan had been bullied at school and would be vulnerable in prison. He said: 'She would find it difficult to cope in prison and would be prone to victimisation.' Speaking after the hearing Kevin's mother Merle Percival said: 'She deserved it, but the damage has been done. 'I am glad that the judge took it seriously. This has destroyed Kevin and my family. 'Kevin's friends said he was always so happy, they have stood by him through this. He would never do anything like this. He is a very angry person still.' Jordan was also made the subject of a supervision order to be put in place on her release.

"At its launch event in September, Apple boss Tim Cook said prices for the firm's upcoming watch would start at $349 - but he refused to go into more detail. Now, French website iGen.fr has been told by a 'reliable source' that the stainless steel model will be available from $500, while the gold version will set customers back up to $5,000. And the source also revealed the firm is on track to release its first wearable around Valentine's Day, as per previous rumours - dismissing more recent claims of a spring release. Scroll down for video . French website iGen.fr has been told by a 'reliable source' that the stainless steel model of Apple's Watch will be available from $500, while the gold version (pictured) will set customers back between $4,000 and $5,000 . According to a translation of French tech site, which correctly reported Apple was working on two iPhone 6 models earlier this year: 'After cooking one of our most reliable contacts - which obviously wishes to remain anonymous - we can lift the veil a little on the prices.' But it stressed that it is 'impossible to be absolutely certain of the truth of these indiscretions.' Apple's Watch will be available in three models: Sport, stainless steel and gold. The prices for Apple’s 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display, bought directly from the UK and US Apple stores differ significantly. In the U.S, the high-end iMac costs $2,503 without state taxes. When state tax for California is added - a state with one of the highest taxes in the country at an average of 9 per cent - the price increases to $2,727.91. In addition to this, California laws state that a recycle fee must be added of $4. This brings the total cost of the order to $2727.91, which converts to £1,704. By comparison, the total price for the iMac in the UK is £1,999 with VAT of £333.17 already included. This is a difference of £295. Within the gold range, users will be able to choose from rose gold and yellow gold, and prices are expected to range between $4,000 and $5,000. This converts to £2,510 and £3,130, but conversions can't be used to determine global prices because Apple typically sets prices on a region-by-region basis. Earlier this week, 9to5Mac reported Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail and online stores as saying: 'We’re going into the holidays, we’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring.' Apple's chief executive Tim Cook unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. He didn't announce exactly when the watch would be available, but said it would go on sale 'early next year.' A 'source close to Apple' told The Information last month that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the watch] before Valentine's Day'. Chinese New Year falls on 19 February next year, so Ms Ahrendts comments push it at least beyond this date. Despite the range of impressive features unveiled by Mr Cook, there was something he failed to mention: battery life. The telling omission suggests the watch’s battery life will be the Achilles Heel of the device when it eventually does go on sale. The source also revealed Apple is on track to release its first wearable around Valentine's Day, as per previous rumours - dismissing more recent claims of a spring release. Apple's Watch will be available in a Sport model, stainless steel and gold. Within the gold range, users will choose from rose gold (pictured) and yellow gold . Despite reports claiming the watch (pictured with boss Tim Cook) would launch in February, a statement recently suggested it has been delayed until 'spring.' Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail and online stores said: 'We’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming' Apple is said to be unhappy with the watch's battery life, and the long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year. Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications . The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri also is built into the Apple Watch. Apple's Watch will be available in three models: Sport, stainless steel and gold. Within the gold range, users will be able to choose from rose gold and yellow gold, and prices are expected to range between $4,000 and $5,000. The closest Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch was saying that users would ‘charge it at night.’ During an interview in Bloomberg Business Week, Apple's senior vice president of operations Jeff WIlliams said: 'We want to make the best product in the world. 'One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them.' The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. A source said Apple is unhappy with the watch's battery life, according to Re/Code. Another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life ‘is about a day now.’ Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. Although he didn't reveal battery life details, Mr Cook did spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging .

The long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year . A spokesperson for Apple declined to provide battery details to MailOnline and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year. Like many of Apple’s other products, the Apple Watch appears to have a sealed back, which means the battery cannot be replaced. This suggests that the entire $349 (£216) device will have to be replaced, once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use. Another concern is the launch of the health and activity-tracking apps on the Apple Watch, which will rely on adequate battery life for round-the-clock monitoring. Companies including Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements. However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed .

Apple’s silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature.

"First lady Michelle Obama took 30 minutes out of her Christmas Eve Tuesday for her annual tradition of answering calls to NORAD's program to track Father Christmas. According to a White House spokesman, Obama answered children's calls to the Santa Claus tracker hotline from the first family's vacation spot in Honolulu, Hawaii, starting at around 11am local time, according to CNN. It marks the first lady's fourth year participating in the U.S. Air Force tradition of tracking Santa. NORAD has tracked the sled's annual faster-than-light journeys since 1958, helping parents answer question how Santa manages to circumnavigate the globe is just one night. Scroll down for video .

Santa and his reindeer en route to Davao City in the Philippines on Christmas Eve . Santa Tracker: Children who can't wait for Santa to arrive can now track his progress delivering presents around the world on Santa Tracker . The Santa Tracker shows Santa - aka 'The Big Red One' - delivering an estimated 1.6billion presents on Christmas Eve. This requires him to visit 822 homes every second at a speed of 650 miles a second - three times the speed of sound. Norad's Santa Tracker first came about by accident on Christmas Eve in 1955 when a local media advertisement listed a direct phone number for Santa – only the number was misprinted. Instead of reaching Santa, the phone rang through to the Crew Commander on duty at the Continental Air Defense Command Operations Center. Rather than disappoint the children, Commander Harry Shoup instructed his staff to give all the children who called a 'current location' for Santa. This is how the tradition began and it continued when Norad replaced Conad in 1958. It has become increasingly advanced over the years, developing from a call-centre manned by volunteers to a visual tracker that can be viewed online. It is also on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. In the Christmas spirit: Volunteers answer phone calls from children asking where Santa is and when he will deliver presents to their house . Busy: Volunteer Katherine Beaupre answers one of thousands of calls to the Santa Tracking Operation at the North American Aerospace Defense Command .

According to Norad, it handles 12,000 e-mails and more than 70,000 telephone calls from more than two hundred countries. But last year, volunteers answered 114,000 phone calls from around the world. The website had 22.3 million unique visitors. Norad Tracks Santa had 1.2 million followers on Facebook and 129,000 on Twitter. Then deputy commander of Norad, Lt. Gen. Marcel Duval, said in 2010: 'It's really ingrained in the NORAD psyche and culture. 'It's a goodwill gesture from all of us, on our time off, to all the kids on the planet.' Norad has teamed up with Microsoft to redesign its Santa Track website for this year. The high-tech website comes with all the latest bells and whistles, including a 3D globe, a holiday countdown and interactive games. The redesign team has added a touch function to the site, allowing smartphone users to pinch and zoom in on Santa’s destinations, according to Microsoft.

"A man has been arrested by Los Angeles police after he stole the ambulance that had been treating him for hallucinations and crashed it into a minivan. The unnamed male had been treated to what is believed to have been hallucinations caused by abusing the drug ‘spice’. However, as Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics were caring for him, he suddenly ran off and stole the ambulance – with the medics still in it. Thief: The unnamed man is taken into care before being arrested after he stole and crashed an LAFD ambulance while it was treating him for hallucinations . A Los Angles Fire Department ambulance had been called to the scene around 7.20pm on Friday after a man had complained of hallucinations after taking ‘spice’. Two paramedics treated the man in the back of the vehicle when he suddenly ripped the IVs out of his arm and ran away, KTLA5 reports. Thinking he had ran off, the paramedics informed LAPD of the incident and began cleaning up the mess left behind. However, the man returned and before they knew it, he had jumped into the driver’s seat and started the ambulance. As paramedics cared for the man, he ripped out the IV and ran off, but later returned and stole the ambulance .

A nearby LAFD vehicle started to pursue the ambulance, and less than two miles down the road, the man crashed into a minivan. Two people travelling in the minivan sustained minor injuries and the ambulance thief was arrested. The unnamed man can expect to be charged with carjacking and felony evading, officials said.

"As the Oxo mother, acting in Calendar Girls or debating life on Loose Women, Lynda Bellingham has always had a special place in the nation's heart. In the Good Housekeeping November issue she talks openly and frankly about her battle with stage four colon cancer and explains how she made the difficult decision to cease having treatment. 'From the start I told Michael I didn't want to hang around if things got too bad. A few months ago I felt that time had come,' explained Lynda. Scroll down for video . Linda, who has been battling colon cancer since she was diagnosed last July has decided to stop treatment . Lynda doesn't believe in bucket lists, but says her wish is to have one last Christmas at home with her family . 'For the past 16 months I have been battling cancer. I knew from the beginning the long-term prognosis was not good, but I was prepared to give it my best shot. 'Now I feel the cancer is winning and rather than keep on fighting it, I have decided to stop the treatment that is keeping me alive. My time will be shorter – I'll live a couple of months if I am lucky – but it will be much happier for me and my family.' Lynda, who was a panellist on Loose Women and starred in the OXO adverts in the 1980s, has weeks to live . 'I have always tried very hard not to cry in front of the family. I know that if I stay positive, they will too. But one night in August I was in such agonising pain down my left side that I couldn't stop the tears. 'The illness had gone to another level and I didn't feel like myself any more. It's the little things that get to you: the mouth ulcers, the tiredness... the difficulty of dealing with a stoma bag.' It was the progression of her disease and the increasing side effects, as well as the bleak prognosis, that has prompted her decision to stop treatment in November – which she hopes will give her one last Christmas feeling as normal as possible. Lynda says her biggest sadness is leaving husband Michael, who she married in 2008 . The actress, who received an OBE in March this year, is determined that people understand her decision, but not feel sorry for her . 'My decision has taken such a weight from my shoulders, and the sense of relief means I can enjoy things again. As I'm very well aware, life is too short and nothing is going to stop me enjoying myself while I can. 'After November there will be no more chemo. We [her husband Michael] both know that once I stop treatment, I will have around eight weeks left. 'At the time, we just held each other and cried. But it was such a relief to say the words. The scariest thing about this disease is that you no longer feel in control. This is my way of taking back control. I'm not giving up, just being realistic.'

"These are the images you have to look twice at to realise exactly what they are. But that is photographer Thorsten Scheuermann's aim.

Thorsten captures the luminous, boiling lava of Kilauea Volcano, blue cracked mud in Oregon's Alvord Desert, and a humble row of trees in Leavenworth, Washington. 'These are sights that can gain greater significance and have their beauty exposed when excluding everything else around them,' he explains.

'I would be delighted if my images encouraged people to pay more attention to their environment.' In most cases, such as the National Monument's Painted Hills, also in Oregon, nature does the hard work for Thorsten which is just the way he likes it. 'I absolutely love being outdoors with my camera,' he says. 'Even when the weather conditions aren't what I was hoping for or if I leave without any photos that are worthwhile, I always have a good time just getting out there and enjoy the process of looking for photo opportunities. 'Typically, people like the colours and patterns in these photos. I'm satisfied when I notice viewers having to look twice, as they try to make sense of what they're looking at. 'I'm always critical of my own work and see lots of opportunity for improvement. But since that means spending more time outside photographing, it's motivating rather than discouraging.'

"This is the shocking moment a cash machine containing more than £10,000 went flying through the air after three raiders used a tow rope to rip it out of a university building. The group of burglars made off with thousands of pounds after fixing a tow rope from their 4x4 to the dispenser, freeing the loot from the machine and flinging it several feet into the air. The whole raid at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich was recorded by Norfolk Constabulary after a tip-off that the three men - including a father and son - were planning to strike. Astonishing: This is the moment the cash machine containing more than £10,000 went flying through the air . Reverse angle: The whole raid at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich was recorded by police . John Eli Loveridge, 38, his son John Stanley Loveridge, 19, and Leonard Smith, 34, thought they had got away with it until police caught up with them, ramming one of the suspects’ getaway vehicles. The men were jailed for a total of 14 years after they had been involved in a string of burglaries. Detective Sergeant Richard Dickinson, from Norwich CID, said: ‘This was a challenging and lengthy investigation culminating in a successful covert operation which led to the arrest of the suspects. ‘We carried out a number of complex lines of inquiry to show their involvement in other crimes and this work ultimately led to the suspects entering guilty pleas. Destroyed: The culprits were jailed for a total of 14 years after they had been involved in a string of burglaries . Getaway: The burglars made off with thousands of pounds after fixing a tow rope from their 4x4 to the machine . ‘This was an organised gang who were prepared to burgle houses and steal cars in order to commit further crimes. It’s fortunate no one was injured when the gang carried out the raids. ‘The technique used resulted in the cash machines flying through the air, as shown in the UEA CCTV, which could have easily hit an innocent member of the public. ‘Hopefully these sentences will bring some comfort to the many distressed victims and witnesses in these crimes who have suffered at the hands of these dangerous men.’ In autumn last year detectives in Norfolk launched an operation targeting suspects after linking ram-raids at Weeting in September and Easton in October. The inquiry also focused on a series of house burglaries across the region prior to the ram-raids being committed, during which the suspects stole high-powered vehicles. Caught: The men thought they had got away with it until police caught up with them, ramming one of the suspects' getaway vehicles . Jailed: John Eli Loveridge (left), 38, of Mildenhall, Suffolk, and his son John Stanley Loveridge (right), 19, of of Newton Flotman, Norfolk, thought they had got away with the raid until police caught up with them . Third man: Leonard Smith (above), 34, of Swavesey, Cambridgeshire, received a four-year sentence . On December 2 last year, a black Mercedes 4x4 approached the entrance of the Student Union and two of the defendants, Loveridge junior and Smith, dressed in white dust suits and balaclavas, went inside while Loveridge’s father waited outside with the 4x4. A tow rope attached to the Mercedes was wrapped around the cash machine, allowing the suspects to rip the ATM from its base. The dispenser, which contained in excess of £10,000, flew about 6ft (1.8m) in the air and travelled about 20ft (6m) before crashing into a wall landing on the floor. Police moved in to arrest the suspects who all made efforts to escape. Loveridge junior and Smith were detained following a short foot pursuit while the third suspect was arrested after a police car rammed the Mercedes as he tried to escape. The driver, of Mildenhall, Suffolk, his son, of Newton Flotman, Norfolk, and Smith, of Swavesey, Cambridgeshire, all pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two counts of conspiracy to commit burglary and were sentenced today at Norwich Crown Court. The oldest man was sentenced to six years in prison, while his son and Smith each received a four year sentence.","Burglars made off with £10,000+ after fixing tow rope from 4x4 to dispenser, .

"The humble postman is at enormous risk working in Australia’s number one most deadly job, according to startling new research. The top ten most dangerous professions for Australians are revealed in a list, with research revealing which industries experience the highest number of workplace deaths. The number one most dangerous industry in Australia is the transport, postal and storage industry. A massive one in three workplace deaths happen on the road. Scroll down for video . A person working in transportation is most a risk of dying on the job, with one in three workplace crashes caused by crashes . 68 per cent of deaths within the industry are caused by car accidents. 65 transport workers were killed on the job in 2012, according to data from Life Insurance Finder. However, injuries are most likely to be caused by muscle stress when moving objects. Australia’s farmers are also at risk, with the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries found to be the second most deadly line of work. The top three leading causes of deaths in farmers, in workplace accidents, include being hit by an animal, drown and heat exposure . 53 of the industry's workers were killed in work-related accidents in 2012, which 3615 were seriously injured while working on the land. Working in the elements, doing labour-intensive work and using heavy machinery doesn’t only make for hard work, but makes the life of a farmer incredibly dangerous. The top three causes of death in farmers include being hit by an animal, drowning and heat exposure. A fisherman is also included in Australia's second most dangerous industry, which lead to 53 workplace deaths in 2012 and 3615 serious injuries . The research has also re-defined the term ‘fashion victims’. Unexpectedly, working in retail is the seventh most dangerous career in Australian . Six people were killed and 11,000 seriously injured due to their work in retail in 2012. A retail assistant is most likely to be injured or killed by driving, explosions, contact with chemicals and ‘being trapped between objects’, according to the official statistics. Incredibly, a retail assistant is the seventh most deadly Australian career. Six people were killed and 11,000 seriously injured due to their work in retail in 2012 . Construction workers face many dangers working in Australia’s third most dangerous profession. Height is the deadliest aspect of the job, with 40 per cent of deaths taking place due to falling. The statistics show most deaths amongst construction workers occur when people fall and hit stationery objects. More than 30 deaths took place amongst construction workers in 2012. Falling from a height is the activity most likely to lead to death for construction workers . Australians in the manufacturing industry are most likely to suffer a serious injury (resulting in an absence from work for at least a week). A shocking 16,670 people suffered serious injuries while working in manufacturing in 2012. The industry is also the fourth most likely to kill an Australian. A fatal car accident, being hit by falling objects and falling from a height are the most dangerous aspects of work in the industry. There's a price to pay for protecting our nation, with policemen in Australia's fifth most deadly industry . There is a price to pay for protecting Australian citizens. Policemen, those working in safety and defence and individuals in government administration are all risking their lives. 13 people in the industry were killed and 4330 Australians were injured, most predominantly as a result of falls.","Research has revealed which ten jobs are the most dangerous for Australians .

"A student has provoked complaints by parents after taking a photo of her paltry school meal of lunch meat, a couple crackers, a slice of cheese and two pieces of cauliflower. Kaytlin Shelton, 17, who is eight months pregnant, took a photo of the $3 meal at a Chickasha school on Monday and showed it to her father who said it was not satisfactory. Her father Vince Holton said: 'I can go pay a dollar for a lunchabe and get more food in it. Schools are responsible for children while they're at school.' Scroll down for video . A student has provoked complaints by parents after taking a photo (pictured) of her paltry school meal of lunch meat, a couple crackers, a slice of cheese and two pieces of cauliflower . Kaytlin Shelton, 17, who is eight months pregnant, took a photo of the $3 meal at a Chickasha school on Monday and showed it to her father who said it was not satisfactory . Kaytlin Shelton told FOX25: 'It makes me want to take that and take it to the Superintendent and tell him to eat it for lunch.' The new lunch, which is served every two weeks, complies with food regulations championed by First Lady Michelle Obama and implemented by the USDA. 'We have a meat-meat alternate, we have a bread grain, we have vegetable,' Asst. State Superintendent for Child Nutrition Joanie Hildenbrand told the news station after looking at the photo. 'It's the student's choice of what they want to take.' Her father Vince Holton said: 'I can go pay a dollar for a lunchabe and get more food in it. Schools are responsible for children while they're at school' 'We have a meat-meat alternate, we have a bread grain, we have vegetable,' Asst. State Superintendent for Child Nutrition Joanie Hildenbrand told the news station after looking at the photo . The Superintendent David Cash admits the meals, which have a calorie limit dependent on the student's age, are not satisfactory. 'You've got in some cases little kids that they're only two meals are breakfast and lunch at school and they're getting you know a grand total of 1100 calories. That's not enough,' he said. There are no exceptions for students who are pregnant or those who are athletes and burn more calories on a daily basis. USDA regulations  now require foods in the school lunch line to be healthier. The new lunch, which is served every two weeks, complies with lunch regulations championed by First Lady Michelle Obama and implemented by the USDA. Pictured: U.S. first lady Michelle Obama at the White House kitchen garden with schoolchildren in Washington this week . Calorie, fat, sugar and sodium limits have to be met on almost every food and beverage sold during the school day at 100,000 schools. Concessions sold at afterschool sports games are exempt. Mrs Obama made herself a national emblem of healthier eating in 2010 with a legislative push for more fruit, vegetables and whole grains in school meals, along with less sodium, sugar and fat. School nutritionists and foodservice workers, and their unions, hailed the law's passage but have since turned on Mrs Obama, saying her caloric inflexibility has sparked a dramatic downturn in lunch sales. Many school districts, they say, are now losing money on food instead of turning a profit that pays for books, computers and football-field scoreboards. Mrs Obama said in July that she would 'fight until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have.'","Kaytlin Shelton, 17, took the photo at a Chickasha, Oklahoma school .

"A foster mother has escaped jail despite scolding a two-year-old boy with boiling water that left third-degree burns. Lan Huyhl Le, 29, was found guilty of second-degree cruelty after the child in her care sustained burns that scaled six inches up his legs, as well as bruising to his ears, face and arm. The boy required skin grafts for the severe blisters, which were uniform and without splash marks, investigators said. Spared jail: Lan Huyhl Le (left) has been spared jail despite being found guilty of inflicting third-degree burns on her two-year-old foster son (pictured right). The child required skin grafts on both legs and sustained bruising . But her sentencing today at Calcasieu Judicial Center in Lake Charles, Louisiana, sparked outrage in the court room as Judge Ron Ware handed Le a five-year suspended prison term and three years' supervised probation. Just six months ago, Ware found Le guilty of child cruelty and told the jury her account of the incident did not match the forensic evidence. Le, who was not burned in the incident, claimed the child climbed into the tub himself and she later rushed in to pull the plug. However,  Ware said in May that she would have been scolded if that were the case. The American Press reports  Le wept when Ware said he was not going to sentence her to serve time. He told the court she still had 'plenty of good' to give and said he felt she acted negligently. Horrific: Police release images of the burns, which were uniform and scaled six inches up the boy's legs. Le claimed the child fell into the tub and she rushed to pull out the plug but a judge said that didn't match forensics . Controversial: The same judge that found Le guilty of cruelty said she 'still has plenty of good' to give . After the sentencing, Ware hugged Le, who now lives in Florida, and her family in the hallway. Ware found Le guilty of second-degree cruelty to a juvenile after a six-day trial in May. Le had requested he hear the case instead of a jury. Blasting the verdict, District Attorney John DeRosier told KPLCtv: 'A two year old child was scalded in this case. 'I think it is inappropriate for the defendant to walk away from this they way that she has. However, that is not for me to decide.' Defense attorney Cliff Newman said Le is a 'good lady.' War of words: The DA John DeRosier (left) felt it was an inappropriate sentence but her attorney described Le as a 'good lady' who took in children when nobody else wanted them. She has received a suspended sentence . 'When nobody wanted those children, Lan Le wanted them and raised them,' he said, asking Ware for a suspended sentence. Le, who did not testify during her trial, said the incident was an 'accident.' 'I loved all my foster kids,' she told Ware. 'What happened was everybody's worst nightmare and something I have to live with every day of my life.' It hurt her that she could not be there for the boy during his recovery, she said. 'Not a day goes by that I don't think about [him],' she said.","WARNING: THIS ARTICLE FEATURES GRAPHIC IMAGES .

"A radio host’s integrity is being questioned on social media after he fell into the trap of pranksters impersonating guests over the phone twice in the past couple of months. Talkback host Tom Elliott was led to believe he was talking to Australian rapper 360 on his 3AW radio show on Monday - while the legitimate artist was filming himself listening to the impersonator be interviewed and then posted the footage on his Facebook page. It is the second time Elliott has been caught with egg on his face after a Kurdish man, living in Scandinavia, pretended to be ISIS commander Omar al-Shishani during a phone interview in August. Scroll down for video . 360 films himself listening to someone impersonate him in an interview with Tom Elliott on his 3AW radio show . Elliott admits on Twitter that he finally realised he was not speaking with the real 360 . This is the second time Elliott has been caught with egg on his face after a Kurdish man, living in Scandinavia, pretended to be ISIS commander Omar al-Shishani during a phone interview in August . The Melbourne radio host thought he was talking to 360 about his controversial remarks on ABC TV show Q & A on October 20 where he said he identified the Australian flag with racism. 360, whose real name is Matt Colwell, took great delight in filming himself listening to the show where the impersonator told Elliott that he had joined the Illuminati – an historical secret society. ‘I was inducted because I am enlightened,’ the caller said when Elliott questioned that calling himself enlightened being was racist. ‘It has nothing to (do with) race it’s a mind frame,’ the fake 360 said. The conversation then became even more bizarre when the prankster declared himself as a unicorn. ‘Who are you to say I’m not a unicorn?’ he said. ‘All I’m trying to do is open everyone’s minds up to these racist ideals and you are just trying to stomp them out.’ It wasn’t until the caller mentioned the previous prank that Elliott began to question his identity. ‘Last few weeks didn’t you interview an Isis fighter who turned out not to be an Isis fighter at all?’ he asked. ‘Yeah, we did and we acknowledged that, are you sure you’re Matt Colwell here?’ Elliot replied. Rapper 360 gets stuck into Elliott in one of many posts about the hoax . The artist known as 360 - aka Matt Colwell - in hysterics when the prankster tells Ellitto that he is a unicorn . A Tweeter incredulous as to how the studio didn't check who the caller was before going to air . Although the impersonator never admitted to the hoax, he went on to ask about the show’s screening process. ‘How much research goes into who you actually interview? Or do they just ring up and say “Hi I’m 360” and I come on?’ he said. After almost nine minutes, Elliott ended the interview and then conceded on Twitter that his guest was in fact an impersonator. 'Spoke to someone on-air and off-air who said that he was rapper 360. Turns out he wasn't. We shut the interview down immediately,' he posted. The authentic 360 took to Twitter with several posts. '1 thing I hope everyone takes tonight is DONT believe eveything the media tells you,' one said. This prompted many fellow Tweeters to ridicule Elliott for falling for the stunt a second time. It was suggested Elliott was also about to interview Elvis, Jesus, 2PAC and Martin Luther King. Some posted saying they had lost all credibility for the talk back host.

"An Arizona sheriff is defending his decision to use a helicopter on Thursday that cost $650 dollars per hour to search for a missing dog. Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County stood behind the choice to use a helicopter to search for pooch Valor, a German shepherd mix, while speaking to KPNX. Scroll down for video . Missing: Authorities believe Valor, pictured, may have fled from a boarding house where 20 dogs were found dead . 'They don't seem to complain when people go up mountains or jump in lakes and we're spending all those resources when they never should have done that,' he said on Saturday.  'We would do it anyway.'

The search for Valor comes after 20 dogs were found dead at Green Acres, a boarding house in Gilbert, the sheriff's office said. Valor was rumored to have fled the property.

"A man recently whose murder conviction was overturned is now  seeking $100million in damages in a federal civil rights lawsuit against seven police detectives, a prosecutor turned judge and a former police chief. The 50-page suit says Columbia, Missouri police fabricated evidence against Ryan Ferguson, bullied witnesses and ignored other leads in their investigation into the 2001 killing of Kent Heitholt, a Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor. The lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri, asks for actual damages of $75million and compensatory damages of $25million. Ten years to the day: The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday which is the 10th anniversary of when Ryan Ferguson (pictured) was first taken into a police interrogation for the 2001 murder of Kent Heitholt . It also names the city of Columbia, its police department, Boone County and two investigators for the county prosecutor's office. Ferguson spent nearly a decade in prison but was released in November 2013 after an appeals court panel ruled that prosecutors wrongly withheld evidence from the defense. Missouri's attorney general opted to not retry Ferguson, who has since moved to Florida to avoid the glare of attention in his hometown. His case gained national attention because his high school classmate, Chuck Erickson, claimed to have recalled through dreams years after the fact that he and Ferguson had killed Heitholt during a late-night robbery after a Halloween of partying. Erickson has since recanted his testimony but is still in prison. Ferguson says his former high school classmate is also innocent. Fighting for civil rights: Ferguson's lawyer Kathleen Zellner, seen beside him in a 2012 hearing, and they named seven police detectives, a prosecutor turned judge and a former police chief in the lawsuit . After his release, Ferguson received a veritable hero's welcome in Columbia at a celebratory news conference, with his new girlfriend by his side. But the lawsuit suggests Ferguson has faced a difficult adjustment. 'Ryan's new identity upon walking out of prison is that of a 29-year-old uneducated, jobless man without health care or funds for psychological counseling,' the suit said. Killer at large: The Halloween night murder of Kent Heitholt was a mystery until police began to suspect Ferguson and his friend in 2004 . 'For years he was branded as a brutal murderer and those scars cannot be excised.' Police spokeswoman Latisha Stroer, who is the only police officer named in the lawsuit who still works for the department, and Circuit Judge Kevin Crane, who prosecuted Ferguson, did not immediately respond to interview requests. Former Columbia police chief Randy Boehm referred a request for comment to the city attorney, who was unavailable Tuesday. As in Ferguson's successful appeal, the civil rights complaint raises questions about the possible involvement of Michael Boyd, a one-time Tribune sports writer. Boyd has provided conflicting statements about when he left work the night of Heitholt's murder and changed his accounts of which of two cars he was driving that night. The new suit says papers belonging to Boyd were found at the crime scene, and that Boyd and Heitholt had a 'major dispute' over a mistake made by Boyd on an assignment from his boss. Boyd, who is now sports editor of the Ste. Genevieve Herald in southeastern Missouri, declined a request for comment. He has denied playing any role in Heitholt's death and testified at Ferguson's appeal only after attorney Kathleen Zellner agreed to not discuss Boyd as a potential suspect at the hearing. The civil rights suit was filed on the 10th anniversary of Ferguson's first police interrogation. Freedom: Ferguson, who is now 29, has since moved to Florida since being freed in Columbia, Missouri . Celebrating every moment: Ryan is seen here with his girlfriend Myka and a relative after his second month of freedom . 'I found myself in an interrogation room being threatened and lied to by the very people we expect to protect us,' he wrote on the Freed Ryan Ferguson Facebook page. 'The people whose (sole) responsibility it is to seek justice ... at least that's the common misperception portrayed to the public.' 'Ten years ago today, I never would have believed I'd end up spending almost my entire twenties in prison for a crime I had nothing to do with. But I did. Can't change that. An apology would be nice though. ' Ferguson was a 17-year-old high school junior at the time of Heitholt's slaying. He was convicted in 2005 and had been serving a 40-year sentence for murder and robbery.","Ryan Ferguson has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the detectives and prosecutor involved in his case that landed him in prison in 2004 .

Ferguson, 29, got in touch with Knox when he was released from prison last year after his conviction was overturned by a Missouri state appeals court panel and the pair quickly struck up a close bond. He has revealed that Knox, 26, is 'doing considerably well' as she awaits the verdict from her latest trial - now the third she has been subjected to - for the 2007 murder of her roommate Meredith Kercher. The sweet taste of freedom: Ryan Ferguson pictured . enjoying a steak and a beer following his release from prison just a . couple of hours earlier in November 2013 . Something in common: It's no secret that Ryan and Amanda have become good friends since both were released. Here Amanda holds a sign welcoming Ryan with her best friend Madison Paxton . Speaking to ABC News, he said: 'She . seems to be doing incredibly well considering the circumstances. The . Italian courts continue to play games with her life which is sadly no . different than what happens here on a daily basis. 'Having . said that, she is very positive and we all believe that justice will . prevail and the facts that have proven her innocence will set her free. It comes after Ferguson revealed reading Knox's book helped get him through some of his darkest days. In . parallels to Ferguson's case, Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele . Sollecito were also wrongfully imprisoned, serving four years in an . Italian prison for the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher. Knox returned to the U.S. a free woman in 2011 after her 2009 murder conviction was thrown out by an Italian appeals court. But she is now being tried for a third time in her absence for the murder. Italy's highest criminal court overturned Knox's acquittal in the 2007 murder of a British student and ordered a new trial. Ferguson . has said he is able to identify with Amanda on many levels. 'I know . first hand what it is like to have the world turn against you based on a . series of lies,' he said in a revealing post on Facebook. Knox, who became a Free Ryan supporter after hearing about his case, says the two have formed a close friendship since his release. ‘To get arrested and to get charged for a . crime you didn't commit is incredibly easy, and you lose your life very . fast,’ Ferguson said upon his release from jail. ‘But to get out of prison, it takes an army.’ Ferguson's case gained attention because . his high school classmate, Chuck Erickson, claimed to have recalled . through dreams that he and Ferguson had killed Heitholt during a . late-night robbery after a Halloween of partying. Erickson has since . recanted his testimony but is still in prison. Ferguson has since revealed that while he was in prison, he read Amanda's book, Waiting To Be Heard. Ferguson has decided to speak publicly about Amanda Knox's case, saying he has studied her situation in depth. Waiting to be read: Ryan Ferguson says he learned a lot about Amanda Knox's case by reading her book whilst in prison. He also drew comfort and inspiration from her words . Wrongfully imprisoned: Amanda Knox, left, and Raffaele Sollecito, are seen outside the rented house where 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher was found dead in Perugia, Italy . 'I . knew about Amanda's case while I was in prison. They're at this crucial . point with their lives right now and to not say something, not speak up . to not help spread awareness, it would be negligent,' Ferguson said. Like . his own case of wrongful imprisonment, many people had a knee-jerk . reaction to Knox's story based on misleading information that has leaked . into the media. In his posting on Facebook, Ferguson points out several facts about Knox's case for people to understand: . 1) When Amanda was initially interviewed by the Italian police she was . badgered for hours in an interrogation that was later ruled illegal by . an Italian appeals court. Amanda eventually signed a false confession in . a moment of desperation. 25% of wrongful convictions are the result of . false confessions (remember, my conviction also hinged on a false . confession from Charles Erickson) 2) There was plenty of DNA evidence in the room in which Meredith Kercher . was murdered including blood and fingerprint samples. NONE of it matched . Amanda. But it DID match with Rudy Guede, who was later convicted of . the murder. 3) The only 'witnesses' against Amanda were later deemed unreliable by an appeals court. (sound familiar?) Ryan Ferguson, left, had been sentenced to 40 years for the 2001 murder of Kent Heitholt, right, a newspaper sports editor . Freed at last: After his release from jail last November, Ryan . Ferguson, 29, held an emotional press conference  thanking his parents and the 'army' of . people who had helped in his struggle . 4) Guede had a history of breaking and entering and wielding a knife. In . the days following Meredith's murder he fled the country. 5) The Prosecution didn't have any real facts to convict Amanda – so . turned the trial into a character assassination, presenting Knox as a . crazed, sexual deviant. (In the same way my Prosecution presented me at . trial as a spoiled rich kid)' Ferguson . notes that despite Knox being originally convicted of Kercher’s . murder and then freed by an Italian appeals court, the current retrial . that is taking place is as a result of an appeal launched by the . prosecution. He believes the retrial is 'a politically motivated move [by the prosecution] to cover . their mistakes.' If Knox loses this appeal she may be extradited to Italy to serve a life sentence for Kercher's murder. If . she isn't extradited she will essentially become a prisoner in her own country, never able to leave the U.S. The conviction with hang over her for the rest of her life. On his decision to speak out about Amanda Knox's predicament, he says the choice was a simple one for him to make.

"Toys 'R Us is removing its Breaking Bad collectible dolls after more than 9,000 people signed a petition launched by a 'concerned parent' in Florida. Susan Schrivjer, from Fort Myers, Florida launched an online campaign to have the action figures pulled from Toys 'R Us' racks, calling them a 'dangerous deviation' from the company's values. Toys 'R Us, based in Wayne, New Jersey, said that the dolls based on the characters from the hit show are being removed immediately from its website and shelves. Scroll down for video . Fully loaded: Both White and his business partner have action figure versions complete with gas masks, a duffel bag of cash, and a toy bag of crystal meth . 'Let's just say, the action figures have taken an indefinite sabbatical,' Toys R Us said in a statement. The retailer had maintained that the figures were sold in limited quantities in the adult-action-figure area of its stores. Ms Schrivjer said she was 'very shocked and appalled' when she found the action figures in a toy shop. 'I was very shocked and appalled,' Susan Schrivjer told reporters about stumbling across the figures . The popular show followed the transformation of mild-mannered high school  teacher Walter White into ruthless drug kingpin Heisenberg when a diagnosis of terminal cancer forces him to cook meth as a means to secure his family's future. Both White and his business partner, Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul, have action figure versions completed with gas masks, a duffel bag of cash, and a toy bag of Heisenberg's trademark blue crystal meth. 'Anything to do with drugs is not doing the right thing,' Ms Schrivjer told Today. 'I just think that they need to look at their visions and values, as they call them.' She has since put a petition up to remove the figures at Change.org, garnering more than 9,250 signatures as of Wednesday morning. 'Toys R Us is well known around the world for their vast selection of toys for children of all ages. 'However their decision to sell a Breaking Bad doll, complete with a detachable sack of cash and a bag of meth, alongside children’s toys is a dangerous deviation from their family friendly values,' the petition states. 'While the show may be compelling viewing for adults, its violent content and celebration of the drug trade make this collection unsuitable to be sold alongside Barbie dolls and Disney characters.' Doppelgangers: Cranston, 58, who portrayed Walter White/Heisenberg in Breaking Bad (left), was evidently not amused by the campaign targeting the action figures . Apples of discord: Susan Schrivjer has called on Toys 'R Us to pull these action figures of Cranston as Walter White and Aaron Paul and Jesse Pinkman pulled from the racks . In an interview with the station WFTX, Schrivjer admitted that she was a fan of Breaking Bad and found the show 'riveting.' But she expressed concerns that children playing with figurines of Heisenberg and Jesse Pinkman would come to mimic their criminal behavior. 'Do you want your child in an orange jumpsuit?' she wondered aloud, referring to the meth cooks' work attire on the show. Cranston, the star of the critically acclaimed AMC drama, responded Monday to Susan Schrivjer on Twitter. '""Florida mom petitions against Toys 'R Us over Breaking Bad action figures."" I'm so mad, I'm burning my Florida Mom action figure in protest,' Cranston, 58, fired off to his followers, sending ripples of glee through the Twitter-sphere. He's the one who tweets: Bryan Cranston took a funny swipe at a Florida mother who has complained about the presence of Breaking Bad action figures in toy stores . Toys 'R Us says 'the product packaging clearly notes that the items are intended for ages 15 and up' and only available in the store's adult action figures area . The Florida mom said that while she loved the show, she does not want her kids running around dressed in orange jumpsuits like Walter and Jesse (pictured)","Toy giant removes Breaking Bad action figures after mother's petition .

"After almost a decade behind bars, . Ryan Ferguson, the 29-year-old Missouri man released earlier this month . for a murder he didn't commit, has been making up for lost time and . enjoying many of the things denied him when he was locked away for all . those years. Ferguson impressed many with his articulate and thoughtful demeanor at a press . conference just hours after his release on November 12, when he spoke of his desire to get . back to the reality of life on the outside. Recent photos posted on the Freed Ryan . Ferguson Facebook page show he has taken his first steps to doing just . that by enjoying simple pleasures such as playing basketball with . friends and cocktails with his girlfriend, as well as sorting out . practical necessities such as getting a driver's license. Scroll down for video . Living his life to the full: Ryan Ferguson poses with his new driver's license, left, and enjoys cocktails with his girlfriend Myka Cain, right . It's good to be free: Ryan Ferguson enjoys a basketball game with his friends . One of the first things that Ferguson has done since his release is visit his grandparents in Florida, where he had spent many happy summers as a youngster. He . had not seen them since Christmas 2003 and had feared he would never . see them again until NBC's Dateline flew Ferguson and his mother to . Florida for an emotional reunion. While in Florida, Ferguson had his photo taken posing with a sign that read 'Freed Ryan.' This was highly symbolic to his supporters, many of whom had posted photos of themselves with signs calling for him to be freed while he was locked up. Ferguson . was just 19 when he was convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison . for the brutal murder of Kent Heitholt, a local newspaper sports editor in . Columbia, Missouri. Ferguson poses with a symbolic 'Freed Ryan' sign while in Florida and, right, enjoys a car ride with his father Bill who did so much to campaign while his son was in prison . Ferguson photographed with four members of his attorney Kathleen Zellner's office at an event last Wednesday to celebrate 'a new beginning' for Ryan . There . was no physical evidence connecting Ferguson to the crime and the guilty . verdict was based solely on two witnesses who later retracted their . testimony. At his press conference at the Tiger Hotel . in Columbia, Ferguson spoke with remarkable composure as he acknowledged . the efforts of his family, his attorney Kathleen Zellner and the army of people who had helped support him while he was locked away. ‘To get arrested and charged . for a crime you didn’t commit is incredibly easy, and you lose your . life very fast. But to get out of prison, it takes an army,’ he said. Since his release, that army of supporters and admirers have raised over $65,000 for him via the Ryan Ferguson Fund campaign, which was launched a few days after his conviction was overturned. The fund has received donations from more than 1,500 supporters, who have donated anything from $10-$1,000 individually. 'The fact of the matter is when he got out he had nothing,' Mike Rognlien, who has spearheaded the fund and Ferguson’s Facebook page, told The Maneater. Group hug: Leslie Ferguson with her parents and son as Ryan is reunited with the grandparents he feared he would never see again . He decided to get involved after seeing coverage of Ferguson on 48 Hours and Dateline NBC. Rognlien said: 'His financial life is basically that of a 19-year-old. When . you’re in your 20s, that’s when you really start building your . foundation. You buy an apartment. You buy furniture, a job, an income, . and he didn’t have any of that.' Rognlien . said he hopes the money the fund raises will not force Ferguson to . worry about finding a job right away, letting him focus on speaking out . against his experience and wrongful conviction. Ferguson has already vowed . to use his freedom to campaign for justice for the victim’s family – . even though they remain convinced of his guilt. His . family fought for years for Ferguson’s release. Now, he has revealed . his intention to follow the campaigning example set by his father, Bill, . in an interview with Keith Morrison for NBC’s Dateline. Learning how to live on the outside: Ryan gets . acquainted with his new iphone, left, technology that didn't exist when . he was convicted and starts learning how to relax at home . Morrison told MailOnline: ‘Ryan is a remarkable young man. He has . withstood the pressures of being in that environment for so many years . and now he that he’s free he wants to get the Heitholt family a sense of . justice. 'They still . believe he’s guilty. He feels they’ve been lied to for years and he . intends to campaign to have the investigation re-opened.' Morrison has followed Ferguson’s case and his family’s fight, for . several years and sat down with Ryan on the day he received word that . this time, after a string of devastating disappointments, his freedom . was ensured. Recalling Ferguson's demeanor during . the interview, which airs tonight at 8pm (7pm Central Time), Morrison . said: ‘I was sitting down with Ryan at 11am that morning while he was . still waiting for word. You could tell he wasn’t allowing himself to get . excited but there was lightness about him that I hadn’t seen before. Ferguson . was arrested in 2004 and convicted the following year after his friend . Chuck Erikson came forward and confessed to the crime that took place in . 2001. The sweet taste of freedom: Ryan Ferguson pictured on November 12 enjoying a steak and a beer following his release from prison just a couple of hours earlier . Kent Heitholt was . viciously beaten and strangled in the car park behind his newspaper . offices. Hair, fingerprints and bloody footprints had been found at the . scene but there was not a shred of forensic evidence that pointed to . either Erikson or Ferguson. Ferguson is not angry with the former friend who drew him into a nightmare. ‘I think there were many years during which Ryan was angry at . Chuck but then he realized Chuck was a confused drug addict and . alcoholic, with a history of black outs,' said Morrison. ‘Chuck had problems and was used and manipulated.’ When asked of his feelings towards Erikson, Ferguson said: ‘I know he’s not a killer. He doesn’t belong in prison.’ Ryan Ferguson, left, had been sentenced to 40 years for the 2001 murder of Kent Heitholt, right, a newspaper sports editor . They never lost hope: Ryan with his mother Leslie, left, father Bill, right and sister Kelly. His mother always believed her son would be returned to her and his father never stopped campaigning to make it happen . He . also said that he respected Erikson and janitor Jerry Trump who . identified Ferguson as having been at the scene of the crime for, . ‘having the courage to admit they lied.’ Speaking . at the moment of his son’s release Bill Ferguson, who campaigned . tirelessly on his behalf, said: ‘It’s the best feeling ever we just feel . like we’ve rescued him from the pits of despair.’ According to Morrison it was a mantra of his father’s that helped Ferguson through some of his darkest days in prison. He said: ‘His father told him, . “Don’t feel sorry for yourself – be better, stronger and smarter and . concentrate on what you can do to better yourself.”’ Ferguson used his time in prison to read and to try to educate other prisoners about nutrition and exercise while inside. Morrison said: ‘Over the years of interviewing Ryan it’s really struck me what an articulate, thoughtful young man he is. Ryan Ferguson's family and friends, including his girlfriend Myka Cain, left, have campaigned tirelessly to have his conviction overturned . ‘He told me, “Look I’m a young relatively articulate, white, well-educated guy, surrounded by an unusually committed determined family fighting for me. ‘Without . that the chances of me getting released were slim to none. I recognize I . was unlucky in the first place but I was enormously lucky after the . fact.”’ The reality, . according to Morrison who has investigated countless miscarriages of . justice in his career, is, ‘Around the country, scattered in prisons all . over America are people who do not have the chances Ryan had, people . who will not get out.’ Now Ferguson, wants to spend some time with the girlfriend he met while in prison, his friends and his family. Having learned how to live in jail he has admitted to being daunted by the prospect of learning to survive on the outside. All smiles: Ryan Ferguson pictured with Dateline investigative reporter Keith Morrison on November 12 just shortly before learning the news of his release after ten years in prison . Morrison said: ‘Ryan said that the first morning he woke up as a free . man he felt he’d slept in a bed that was too soft, on a pillow that . wasn’t right. ‘He went for a walk and felt like a tourist in his hometown because it has changed so much over the years. ‘He . said he felt stressed for the first time in a long time and he . recognizes that his job now is to work out how to live. He’s 29 and he . has to work out what to do with his life now he’s been given it back.’","Ryan Ferguson from Columbia, Missouri was sensationally freed earlier this month after his conviction and 40 year jail term was overturned .

"Up to ten ebola cases could be seen in Britain by Christmas, the Health Secretary warned last night. Jeremy Hunt told Parliament that the health crisis will get worse before it improves. As the death toll in West Africa passed 4,000, Mr Hunt announced that screening for ebola will begin at Heathrow airport today. Scroll down for video . International airports are already screening passengers for ebola - such as this Moroccan health worker using a thermometer at the arrivals hall of the Mohammed V airport in Casablanca . Moroccan health workers dressed in protective gear check people's temperature as they arrive in Casablanca . Health workers in Macedonia's capital Skopje have also begun screening the skin temperature of the passengers with a thermal imaging camera upon their arrival at Alexander the Great airport . He told MPs: ‘In the next week, Public Health England will start screening and monitoring UK-bound air passengers identified by the Border Force coming on to the main routes from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. ‘This will allow potential ebola virus carriers arriving in the UK to be identified, tracked and given rapid access to expert health advice should they develop symptoms.’ The World Health Organisation yesterday described the epidemic as the ‘most severe acute health emergency in modern times’ as the number of cases hit 8,400, killing 4,030. Screening measures – a questionnaire followed by a possible medical examination and temperature check – will be introduced at Heathrow Terminal 1 today, followed later this week at Gatwick, Eurostar stations and other Heathrow terminals. Mr Hunt said the procedure should pick up 89 per cent of people travelling from the affected region, and it could be extended to Birmingham and Manchester if the risk increases. Anyone who tests positive for ebola will be transferred to Royal Free Hospital in north London, where British nurse William Pooley, 29, was successfully treated when he contracted the virus in August. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the Government would collect mobile phone numbers from people potentially suffering from ebola . Staff from North East Ambulance Service and the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle tool part in a national exercise to test Britain's readiness for an ebola outbreak . There are also plans to provide ebola ‘surge wards’ in Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield, to make a total of 26 beds available. ‘The situation will get worse before it gets better,’ he told the Commons. Nurse: Nina Pham . The nurse who became the first person to catch ebola in the US breached safety protocols, officials believe. Officials at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas insisted Nina Pham had been wearing full protective gear while treating Liberian Thomas Duncan, who died there last week after he had initially been sent home with antibiotics. Miss Pham, 26, was described as ‘clinically stable’ yesterday. Federal officials said she may have caught the virus as she tried to take off her bulky protective gear without any of the material touching her skin, eyes, nose or mouth. ‘The care of ebola patients can be done but it’s hard to do it safely,’ said US disease control chief Dr Thomas Frieden. He said it was ‘genuinely very difficult’ to predict an exact number of UK cases but, when pushed, said up to ten would be expected in the next three months. Mr Hunt admitted he could not guarantee UK patients would receive the experimental drug ZMapp that was given to Mr Pooley. The Health Secretary also announced that calls to the NHS’s non-emergency 111 phoneline will be screened for potential ebola sufferers. Medical experts have criticised the screening – which stops short of the automated temperature scanning introduced by the US – as a ‘political gesture’. The ability of NHS hospitals to deal with ebola was called into question after reports that one patient suspected to have the virus was allowed to receive visitors and use a communal toilet and kitchen at Lewisham Hospital, South London. The patient, later given the all-clear, was only isolated when staff reportedly refused to go near him. Mr Hunt said the case highlighted, ‘the importance of making sure that the guidance is widely understood’. Underlining the potential turmoil, WHO director-general Margaret Chan said yesterday: ‘I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries.’","Passengers to be checked for virus on arrival into Heathrow from today .

"Melting Antarctic snow has revealed the notebook of Captain Robert Scott’s official expedition photographer. Researchers found George Levick’s journal outside the 1911 Terra Nova base in the heart of the Antarctic following this year's annual thaw. Despite thaws in previous years, this is the first time the notebook has been seen in more than a century. Scroll down for video . The notebook (pictured) is called Wellcome Photographic Exposure Record and Diary 1910 and was discovered by New Zealand’s Antarctic Heritage Trust. Researchers found the journal outside the Terra Nova base in the heart of the Antarctic following the annual thaw . The notebook is called Wellcome Photographic Exposure Record and Diary 1910 and was discovered by New Zealand’s Antarctic Heritage Trust. It belonged to surgeon, zoologist and photographer George Murray Levick, who was born in 1876 and died 1956, whose name is clearly written in the opening pages. Mr Levick was a part of Captain Robert Scott’s 1910 to 1913 expedition. His notebook contains pencil notes detailing the date, subjects and exposure details for the photographs he took during 1911 while at Cape Adare, before undergoing a harsh winter in an ice cave on Inexpressible Island. Close examination reveals links between the notations in the notebook and photographs held by the Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge that have been attributed to Mr Levick, too. It belonged to surgeon, zoologist and photographer George Murray Levick, who was born in 1876 and died 1956, and his name is clearly written in the opening pages.Mr Levick was a part of Captain Robert Scott’s 1910 to 1913 expedition and a member of the Northern Party. The notebook (pictured during conservation work) contains Mr Levick's notes detailing the date, subjects and exposure details for the photographs he took during 1911 while at Cape Adare before undergoing a winter in an ice cave on Inexpressible Island. Its binding had been dissolved by 100 years of ice and water damage . Captain Robert Falcon Scott led the Terra Nova expedition, officially called the British Antarctic Expedition 1910, with the aim to be the first to reach the geographical South Pole. But when his team of four companions arrived on 17 January 17, 1912, they discovered a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had already arrived 33 days earlier. Captain Scott’s entire team died in March during their return on the Ross Ice Shelf from a combination of exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold. Captain Scott was a Royal Navy officer and explorer from Devon, who had previously led the Discovery Expedition to the Antarctic from 1901 and 1904. Scott's Hut was built in 1911 on Cape Evans, Ross Island in Antarctica. There is a second hut, built during the Discovery Expedition of 1901 to 1904, south of Cape Evans, which is also referred to as Scott's Hut, as well as Discovery Hut. ‘It’s an exciting find. The notebook is a missing part of the official expedition record. 'After spending seven years conserving Scott’s last expedition building and collection, we are delighted to still be finding new artefacts,’ said Nigel Watson, Antarctic Heritage Trust’s Executive Director. The notebook’s binding had been dissolved by 100 years of ice and water damage, allowing the pages to be separated and digitised before repair. French paper conservator Aline Leclercq then began the task of conserving and rebuilding the notebook. This involved separating each individual page, stabilising and cleaning the pages, rebuilding the notebook into sections before sewing the book back together and reconstructing the cover remnants. Conservation treatment provided the opportunity to digitise each page of the notebook. This allows for a more comprehensive study without risking the fragile object. The notebook has since been returned to Antarctica and is one of 11,000 other artefacts stored at the Cape Evans location. In 2013, the Antarctic Heritage Trust (NZ) discovered photographic negatives left in the expedition base. Two years earlier, the trust discovered three crates of whisky and two crates of brandy under Ernest Shackleton’s 1908 base during conservation work. Captain Robert Falcon Scott led the Terra Nova expedition, officially called the British Antarctic Expedition 1910, with the aim to be the first to reach the geographical South Pole. But when his team of four companions arrived on 17 January 17, 1912, they discovered a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had already arrived 33 days earlier. Scott's Hut (pictured) was built in 1911 on Cape Evans, Ross Island in Antarctica. Captain Robert Falcon Scott led the Terra Nova expedition, officially called the British Antarctic Expedition 1910, with the aim to be the first to reach the geographical South Pole.

This entry reads '[Raymond] Priestley, [Harry] Dickason and [Frank] Browning set a fish trap and [Lieutenant Victor] Campbell with theodolite.' The notebook has since been returned to Antarctica to be stored at the Cape Evans location . Captain Scott’s entire team died in March during their return on the Ross Ice Shelf from a combination of exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold. Captain Scott was a Royal Navy officer and explorer from Devon, who had previously led the Discovery Expedition to the Antarctic from 1901 and 1904. Scott's Hut was built in 1911 on Cape Evans, Ross Island in Antarctica. There is a second hut, built during the Discovery Expedition of 1901 to 1904, south of Cape Evans, which is also referred to as Scott's Hut, as well as Discovery Hut. The Antarctic Heritage Trust (NZ) is responsible for the conservation of five historic sites in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica including Ernest Shackleton’s, Robert Falcon Scott’s and Edmund Hillary’s expedition bases through its Ross Sea Heritage Restoration Project. Work is currently centred on conserving artefacts from Captain Scott’s 1911 expedition base and conserving Captain Scott’s 1902 expedition base. French paper conservator Aline Leclercq undertook the task of conserving and rebuilding the notebook. This involved separating each individual page, stabilising and cleaning the pages, (pictured) rebuilding the notebook into sections before sewing the book back together and reconstructing the cover remnants . The notebook has since been returned to Antarctica (Scott's Hut is marked) as one of 11,000 other artefacts stored at the Cape Evans location.

"A Missouri man released this week after almost a decade in jail for a murder he did not commit has vowed to use his freedom to campaign for justice for the victim’s family – even though they remain convinced of his guilt, MailOnline can reveal. Twenty-nine year old Ryan Ferguson was just 19 when he was convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison for the brutal murder of Kent Heitholt, local newspaper sports editor in Columbia, Missouri. There was no physical evidence connecting Ferguson to the crime and the guilty verdict was based solely on two witnesses who later retracted their testimony. Scroll down for video . Freed man walking: After a decade in jail for a murder he didn't commit, Ryan Ferguson admits it will take time to adjust to his very changed hometown of Columbia, in an interview with Dateline's Keith Morrison . Kent Heitholt's daughter, Kali, pictured here in October 2005 during the trial that ended with Ryan's conviction - a conviction she and her mother still believe to be right . His family fought for years for Ferguson’s release. Now, he has revealed his intention to follow the campaigning example set by his father, Bill, in an exclusive interview with Keith Morrison, 66, for NBC’s Dateline. Mr Morrison told MailOnline: ‘Ryan is a remarkable young man. He has withstood the pressures of being in that environment for so many years and now he that he’s free he wants to get the Heitholt family a sense of justice. 'They still believe he’s guilty. He feels they’ve been lied to for years and he intends to campaign to have the investigation re-opened.' Mr Heitholt’s widow, Deborah Evangelista, issued a brief statement on learning of Ferguson’s release, and described the news as ‘painful.’ The reunion he feared would never happen: Ryan is met by his grandfather at the door of his Florida home. As he held his grandson close the older man said simply, 'I love you.' Group hug: Leslie Ferguson with her parents and son as Ryan is reunited with the grandparents he feared he would never see again . She said: ‘It is painful. You just . want to let go and lead your life. I have to keep reminding myself that . whatever happens, God is in control and justice will ultimately be . served by him.’ Since his . sensational release on Tuesday, Ferguson has, according to Mr Morrison, . being trying to adjust to the reality of life on the outside. Learning how to live on the outside: Ryan gets acquainted with his new iphone, left, technology that didn't exist when he was convicted and starts learning how to relax at home . The sweet taste of freedom: Ryan Ferguson pictured on November 12 enjoying a steak and a beer following his release from prison just a couple of hours earlier . All smiles: Ryan Ferguson pictured with Dateline investigative reporter Keith Morrison on November 12 just shortly before learning the news of his release after ten years in prison . Mr Morrison has followed Ferguson’s case and his family’s fight, for several years and sat down with Ryan on the day he received word that this time, after a string of devastating disappointments, his freedom was ensured. Recalling Ferguson's demeanor during the interview, which airs tonight at 8pm (7pm Central Time), Mr Morrison said: ‘I was sitting down with Ryan at 11am that morning while he was still waiting for word. You could tell he wasn’t allowing himself to get excited but there was lightness about him that I hadn’t seen before. Unending pain: Kent Heitholt's widow Deborah Evangelista clings to her daughter Kali during Ferguson's 2005 trial. She cannot bring herself to believe he is innocent . ‘He just looked like a different person. ‘Seven hours later he was standing in front of an overflowing crowd of cheering excited people, dressed in clothes he hadn’t worn for a decade, surrounded by people he hadn’t seen for a decade.’ At a press conference at the Tiger Hotel in Columbia Ferguson spoke with remarkable composure as he acknowledged the efforts of his family and attorney, Kathleen Zellner. They never lost hope: Ryan with his mother Leslie, left, father Bill, right and sister Kelly. His mother always believed her son would be returned to her and his father never stopped campaigning to make it happen . He said: ‘To get arrested and charged for a crime you didn’t commit is incredibly easy, and you lose your life very fast. But to get out of prison, it takes an army.’ High on Ferguson's 'to-do list' on his release was visiting his grandparents in Florida, where he had spent many happy summers. He had not seen them since Christmas 2003 and had feared he would never see them again. Mr Morrison and his crew flew Ferguson and his mother to Florida and an emotional reunion. Ferguson was arrested in 2004 and convicted the following year after his friend Chuck Erikson came forward and confessed to the crime that took place in 2001. Kent Heitholt was viciously beaten and strangled in the car park behind his newspaper offices. Hair, fingerprints and bloody footprints had been found at the scene but there was not a shred of forensic evidence that pointed to either Erikson or Ferguson. Today, Mr Morrison said, Ferguson is not angry with the former friend who drew him into a nightmare. He said: ‘I think there were many years during which Ryan was angry at Chuck but then he realized Chuck was a confused drug addict and alcoholic, with a history of black outs. ‘Chuck had problems and was used and manipulated.’ When asked of his feelings towards Erikson, Ferguson said: ‘I know he’s not a killer. He doesn’t belong in prison.’ Ryan Ferguson, left, had been sentenced to 40 years for the 2001 murder of Kent Heitholt, right, a newspaper sports editor . He also said that he respected Erikson and janitor Jerry Trump who identified Ferguson as having been at the scene of the crime for, ‘having the courage to admit they lied.’ Speaking at the moment of his son’s release Bill Ferguson, who campaigned tirelessly on his behalf, said: ‘It’s the best feeling ever we just feel like we’ve rescued him from the pits of despair.’ According to Mr Morrison it was a mantra of his father’s that helped Ferguson through some of his darkest days in prison. He said: ‘His father told him, “Don’t feel sorry for yourself – be better, stronger and smarter and concentrate on what you can do to better yourself.”’ Ferguson used his time in prison to read and to try to educate other prisoners about nutrition and exercise while inside. Mr Morrison said: ‘Over the years of interviewing Ryan it’s really struck me what an articulate, thoughtful young man he is. Ryan Ferguson's family and friends, including his girlfriend Myka Cain, left, have campaigned tirelessly to have his conviction overturned . ‘He told me, “Look I’m a young relatively articulate, white, well-educated guy, surrounded by an .

I recognise I was unlucky in the first place but I was enormously lucky after the fact.”’ The reality, according to Mr Morrison who has investigated countless miscarriages of justice in his career, is, ‘Around the country, scattered in prisons all over America are people who do not have the chances Ryan had, people who will not get out.’ Now Ferguson, wants to spend some time with the girlfriend he met while in prison, his friends and his family. Having learned how to live in jail he has admitted to being daunted by the prospect of learning to survive on the outside. Mr Morrison said: ‘Ryan said that the first morning he woke up as a free man he felt he’d slept in a bed that was too soft, on a pillow that wasn’t right. ‘He went for a walk and felt like a tourist in his hometown because it has changed so much over the years. ‘He said he felt stressed for the first time in a long time and he recognises that his job now is to work out how to live. He’s 29 and he has to work out what to do with his life now he’s been given it back.’","Ferguson from Columbia, Missouri was sensationally freed on Tuesday after his conviction and 40 year jail term was overturned .

"A British tourist savaged by a Barbary ape while on holiday in Gibraltar required 40 stitches in his arm after nurses described the attack as the worst they'd ever seen. Stuart Gravenell, 53, and his 22-year-old son Bradley were walking through a nature reserve in the Mediterranean British territory when a pack of apes came charging towards them. The largest male ape in the group, which stood more than three feet tall, then jumped on to Mr Gravenell, sinking it's teeth into his arm and shaking its head in an act that left the retired IT worker in so much pain that he passed out. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

After being bitten by the large ape, Mr Gravenell was rushed to hospital, where nurses said they were treating at least two ape-inflicted injuries a week - with his the worst they had seen so far. He was given 20 numbing injections and 40 stitches to inch-deep wounds so bad that nurses told him they would have led to an arm amputation in a child. Mr Gravenell was forced to spend three nights in hospital after his wounds became infected, while the rest of his family struggled on trying to enjoy the holiday. On his return to the UK, Mr Gravenell went straight to A&E where he doctors told him he had extensive nerve damage in his forearm, leaving him with a pronounced loss of feeling.

Aggressive: Gibraltar's Barbary macaques are made up of five troops which occupy the Upper Rock area of the Gibraltar Nature Reserve. They are the only wild ape population in Europe . Describing the ordeal, the said: 'You just wouldn't believe how traumatic it was. It was a very very upsetting experience. It was supposed to be a nice family holiday and it was totally ruined.' 'I have no recollection of the actual incident - I think I must have blocked it out. But Bradley said it just ran up and stopped dead in its tracks and jumped on me - half on my back and half of my shoulder. 'He [Bradley] said it grabbed my arm - I've got claw marks - and it bit into me arm and just shook. It was so aggressive. It savagely bit my arm, tearing it open,' he added. 'It jumped off and was just sat on the wall looking at me. Blood was pouring and spurting everywhere - it was like a tap,' Mr Gravenell went on to say. The attack came after Mr Gravenell drove to Casares del Sol in Spain from his home in Hardwicke, Gloucestershire, for a three-week break with wife Diane, 55, and Bradley.

Stuart Gravenell pictured during his holiday in Gibraltar. The photograph was taken before the savage attack . After being bitten by the macaque, Stuart Gravenell was rushed to the nearby St Bernards Hospital. Nurses there said they are treating at least two ape-inflicted injuries a week - with his the worst they had seen so far . * Gibraltar's ape population is made up of five troops which occupy the Upper Rock area of the Gibraltar Nature Reserve. * They are descended from North African apes and are thought to have been brought to the area by The Moors between 711 and 1492 who kept them as pets. * They are regarded as a tourist attraction and often climb on visitors who pose for pictures. * In recent years the regular contact with people was blamed for a breakdown of the animals' social groups which made them more dependent on people and more likely to cause damage. Now anyone caught feeding them is fined £500. * The apes are currently managed by the Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society and earlier this month 30 of the most disruptive were exported to Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling in Scotland. The keen walker and his son took a day trip to nearby Gibraltar and paid 50p each to enter the Upper Rock Nature Reserve on September 24. They were warned not to feed the apes who live on the top of the Rock and decided to skip the 'Ape Den' where tourists pose with the animals. Instead, they headed for the Charles V wall, part of the historic fortifications, and began their descent from the upper reaches of the 1,400ft Rock. As they started down the steps a group of apes bounded along the narrow wall next to them, chased by a larger primate. Mr Gravenell and his son, who had no food with them, froze while the animals fought and watched in terror when they turned back towards them. Without warning the ape jumped back onto the wall before leaping on to Stuart's back as it ran passed him, sinking its teeth into his arm. It furiously shook its head before letting go and then proceeded to sit and watch as the two bites started bleeding profusely. Recovery: Doctors said the inch-deep wounds were so bad they would have led to an arm amputation in a child . Getting better: A spokesman for the Government of Gibraltar said the attack on Stuart was the most 'severe' he had ever seen but said there was little more local authorities could do to protect tourists . Mr Gravenell was helped to a nearby sitting area by shocked fellow tourists where he fainted in pain before being taken to the nearby St Bernards Hospital. He called on the Gibraltar government to do more to warn about the dangers of the 300-strong ape population on the British colony. He said: 'Everyone I was speaking to out there said the apes are getting out of control... I'm scared they are going to wait until there is a fatality to take action. 'My GP said if the same had happened to a child or an elderly person the sheer trauma may have killed them or they could have lost an arm. 'And to think this happened in a public place where tourists are actually encouraged to go - it's frightening.' A spokesman for the Government of Gibraltar said the attack on Stuart was the most 'severe' he had ever seen. Albert Poggio, the UK-based representative for the colony, said: 'It is very very sad but what can one say?' 'These monkeys are wild. We do give as much notice all over the place. It is very unfortunate.'","Stuart Gravenell, 53, attacked by pack of apes in Gibraltar nature reserve .

Donna Watson, of Peterlee, County Durham with her daughter Millie. The young mother suffered a massive stroke just five months after giving birth to Millie leaving her paralysed down the right hand side of her body . But the young mother was determined to defy doctors and just three months after the stroke she walked out of hospital using a walking stick. She is planning to be able to move unaided and walk down the aisle when she marries her fiancée Nicky King in July next year. Now she is speaking out about her ordeal as part of World Stroke Day and warning that they could hit anybody. Miss Watson had been watching cartoons with her daughter when she heard a bang in her head and began to feel sick and tired. She was rushed to hospital where she was found to have suffered a stroke . Miss Watson, who has had to give up her job as a videographer, had been watching cartoons with her daughter, when she stood up to do some housework in February last year. She explained: 'I heard a bang in my head and I started to feel sick and tired.' She then was unable to put baby Millie into her Moses basket and only had the strength to put pillows around her daughter. Next year Miss Watson is determined to walk down the aisle unaided when she weds her fiancee Nicky King, pictured . She then rang her fiancée Nicky, who rushed home from his job at the nearby Walker's Snack Foods factory and she was taken to hospital. Miss Watson then spent three days at the University Hospital of Hartlepool before being transferred to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough in a critical condition. There, medics discovered she had suffered three blood clots on the brain. She added: 'I was just past the safety window of three-hour blood clot infection, all they could do was give me bloods and monitor me.' Due to her paralysis, she could not be on her own with the baby for a year until she learned herself how to care for Millie with one hand. 'It was a lot of trial and error,' said Miss Watson, who is also step-mum to Lewis, 13, and Dylan King, 10. 'I don't want any other young mothers to be sitting there in hospital being so scared that they are unable to raise their child. 'It will get better.' One in eight UK women wrongly believes a stroke could never happen to them, according to figures from The Stroke Association. Around 30,000 women die from a stroke every year and it is the third leading cause of death in women in the UK. Elaine Roberts, director of life after stroke services at the Stroke Association, said: 'Its extremely worrying that most women don't even have stroke on their radar.' She said women of all ages can reduce their risk of stroke, including keeping blood pressure under control, regular exercise and stopping smoking.","Donna Watson suffered a massive stroke just five months after giving birth .

Nottinghamshire Police now fears the man could be one of 10 'hardcore' beggars operating in the city, none of who are thought to be genuinely homeless or in need of help. Begging: The man was found to be carrying the money (pictured) when officers arrested him on an unrelated matter. They were forced to let him keep the cash when they could find no evidence he had obtained it illegally . Police officers originally arrested the unidentified man last week after he failed to turn up at Lincolnshire Court on an unrelated matter. Upon searching him they discovered a haul of £800 in notes and coins in his pockets. Police said that although the man is well known as a prolific beggar, they were forced to hand the money back to him as he had been arrested for something else and it could not be proven that he had broken any law in obtaining it. The man was later released without charge. A police spokeswoman told MailOnline: . 'As far as we know the man isn't actually homeless. He is just sitting . shivering and people feel sorry for him. If he doesn't actually ask for . money, he hasn't broken the law.' She added: 'People will just feel sorry for him and say 'here's a tenner mate'. That's what we believe to be happening'. 'The money may have been taken away for . safe-keeping after his arrest but it will . definitely be handed back to him, if it hasn't been already,' she went on to say. Officers say the large sum of money suggests the man may be one of a group of all-British 'hardcore' beggars they fear are operating in the city. Trick: Police fear the man could be one of 10 'hardcore' beggars operating in the Nottingham city centre, none of who are thought to be genuinely homeless or in need of help . Speaking to the Nottingham Post, Chief Inspector Shaun Ostle of Nottinghamshire Police said: 'This shows they are basically conning people. He said it was three days' work. Finding that amount of money on someone like that doesn't surprise us any more – which is perhaps the more worrying thing, really'. Mr Ostle says he believes some of the group have been posing as Big Issue sellers in the city, adding: 'They have been stopped before with similar amounts on them. It just shows that when some of these people ask for money it is just a scam. People need to understand they are being conned.' He went on to say: 'These people have more than enough so that they don't need to go on begging. 'We've even had officers approach members of the public that have given them £10 and ask 'you do realise he's not homeless?' and people say 'yes but I feel sorry for him'.' The news comes just months after another man boasted to police of making £700 a week while begging in Nottingham city centre. He is said to have used a taxi to travel between begging hotspots and was given so much food by members of the public that he had to throw vast quantities of it away. The Nottinghamshire Police spokeswoman said: 'The message here really is not to give to people on the street. There are plenty of options available to people, through charities and hostels.' 'If you give to people on the street you really have no idea who that money is going to,' she added. Local homeless charity Framework also urged people not to give to beggars as they have no way of knowing how the cash will be spent.","Man boasted to police officers that he raised the money in just three days .

"Police spent three weeks trying to evict 14 squatters from the home of a 101-year-old stroke victim after she moved into a care home. Great-grandmother Megan Wilkinson's home in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire was left empty when she was taken into residential care, and so her family decided to let it out to help pay her medical bills. But they were horrified when letting agents visited the large detached property to find it had been overrun by squatters. Police spent three weeks trying to evict 14 squatters from the home of a 101-year-old stroke victim after she moved into a care home . Megan Wilkinson's home was left empty in in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, when she went into care, and so her family decided to let it out to help pay her medical bills . The house was filled with duvets and the occupants, said to be from Eastern Europe, had been smoking. Clothes were scattered across the grass of the back garden and black bags were piled high full of rubbish. The family called police as soon as the agents alerted them on October 3 but nothing was done. When they called again three days later the family said police informed them it was a civil matter and they would not get involved. Officers also told them their best option was to obtain an eviction of trespassers order from court - which could cost £4,000. It was only when the family called in their local MP that a senior officer 'reviewed' the case and the squatters were removed on Wednesday - three weeks after moving in. Mrs Wilkinson's daughter Ann, who lives in Germany, said her mother had lived in the house for 65 years before suffering her stroke. It had left her partially paralysed and in need of 24-hour care - and the problem with the squatters made her stressed at a time when she needed to recover. Her daughter said: 'The agents had been carrying out a viewing and arrived at the house to find all these people inside. 'I rang the police to inform them about trespassers. Nothing happened. 'I rang again on October 6, whereupon the police went to our property with our agent and gave these so-called tenants seven days' notice to vacate because they were trespassing.' It is believed the squatters got into the house as decorators did it up and managed to steal a set of house keys. She added: 'There were about 14 people but only four said they were renting and 10 were visiting. 'Duvets were seen strewn over the floors of the bedrooms and there was evidence of smoking. 'Although we were given a crime reference number by the police they told our solicitor it was a squatter trespass but should be treated as a civil matter. Her family were horrified when letting agents visited the large detached property to find it had been overrun by squatters and so called in police . 'We were told there was no other option but to obtain an eviction of trespassers order from court, which could cost £4,000.' The house stood empty yesterday with boards covering the downstairs windows and rubbish in the driveway. Tatty orange curtains were partly drawn on the upstairs windows and the front garden was overgrown with weeds. An empty cupboard and two dirty mattresses had also been left dumped on the driveway. Tory MP for Peterborough Stewart Jackson, who was asked to help by the family's solicitor, yesterday accused the police of 'a lack of common sense'. He said: 'I was very concerned that the police were inferring that they couldn't take any action and that it was a civil matter. 'What we have seen here is a lack of common sense from the police and a lack of urgency. I have made my opinions very clear to the police. 'Police should be careful about setting a precedence that they are a soft touch. 'Sometimes the police are too worried about being politically correct.' He said he would be writing to Peterborough City Council to say he would be 'very unhappy' if the squatters were now given priority on the housing list over local families. Cambridgeshire police announced that they had visited the property on Wednesday and evicted the occupants. The house is now boarded up, and black bags have been piled high full of rubbish . A spokesman said: 'Initially the tenant and the estate agents had put in civil measures to try to remove the occupants from the property, however that was not successful. 'That decision was reviewed by a more senior officer and it was decided that these people were acting illegally and officers intervened. 'Four men and two women were asked to pack their things and vacate the property which they did and no force was needed. 'Officers will be looking further into the matter and also into the way the issue was handled.' A elderly woman who lived near to Mrs Wilkinson said she was a 'pleasant lady' who would always ask people in for a sherry. The neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she thought Mrs Wilkinson had not been living in the house for around four years. She said: 'She was a nice woman, well educated and a pleasure to speak to. She would walk past two times a day with her little dog. 'Everyone knew her but she left three or four years ago to live in Germany with her daughter. The whole area has changed since then. 'She would be the kind of lady to ask anyone who knocked on her door in for a sherry.'","Megan Wilkinson's home was left empty when she went into care .

"It seems right that different cultures would adapt Santa to suit their own traditions. But when the finished product involves riding a Harley Davidson, dressing in a slick zoot suit and sporting a sombrero you know that your Santa has the cool factor. Meet Pancho Claus, the Tex Mex Santa who usually has black hair, a black beard or sometimes just a moustache. Scroll down for video . Peter Martinez stands in front of his lowrider 'sleigh' in Odessa Texas . Like Santa, he wears a hat — though often it's a sombrero. He dons a serape or a poncho and, in one case, a red and black zoot suit. Pancho Claus likes to make an entrance wherever he goes too, usually on a lowrider or Harley Davidson, led by a pack of burros instead of eight reindeer. The tradition comes from the Chicano civil rights movement, and Pancho Claus is mostly based in Texas US. Rudy Martinez of San Antonio in his Pancho Claus costume . The Pancho Claus' traditionally have a black beard, but draw on their area's cultural flavour too . Pancho Claus Rudy Martinez visits a school in San Antonio Texas . The Pancho Claus tradition was borne of the Chicano civil rights movement in the late 1970s: Rudy Martinez (pictured) cuts a striking figure on a visit to bring some festive cheer to school children . Mesmerized school children enjoy a visit from Pancho Claus . Lorenzo Cano, a Mexican-American studies scholar at the University of Houston, says Pancho was apparently conceived north of the border as Mexican-Americans looked to 'build a place and a space for themselves' in the 1970s. His rise coincided with a growing interest in Mexican art, Cinco de Mayo, Mexican Independence Day and other cultural events. Each of the Panchos has a unique local flavour, and the tradition is adored across Texas. Some . historians believe that the tradition is set to spread to other parts . of the US too, with Panchos being spotted in California already. Children receive gifts from Pancho Claus across Texas, and the tradition aims to bring Christmas cheer to disadvantaged youngsters . In the West Texas plains, Pancho Claus is known as Pancho Clos. Julian Perez, a 71-year-old retired heating and air conditioning . repairman, has been Lubbock Texas' Pancho for 30 years and remembers when . three men, all of whom have since died, first came up with the idea. Mr Perez, who wears a long salt-and-pepper beard, . oversized sombrero and colorful poncho when he assumes the role of . Pancho, said: 'I . wanted to quit, but I just can't. It just makes me want to do something . for the kids.' Robert Narvaiz, vice commander for Lubbock's American GI Forum and coordinator of that city's Pancho project, said: 'Pancho Claus comes from the South Pole, and Santa Claus comes from the North Pole, and every year they get together here in Lubbock. 'Santa ... was he Anglo? Was he black? Was he Hispanic? I guess everybody is trying to do the same thing: Add a little of their own culture.' This city's Pancho dates to 1971, when the local American GI Forum decided to infuse a little Hispanic culture into Santa. They gave him a sombrero and serape, and held a big party at a park, giving out candy and fruit to 3,000 children. Today, Pancho visits schools, churches and supermarkets, but the biggest event — now supported by three different car clubs and dozens of bikers — remains the party at Rogers Park. There, on the Sunday before Christmas, Pancho hands out gifts. In Houston Texas Pancho wears a signature red and black zoot suit, fedora hat and waves to children from the back of a lowrider. Richard Reyes, 62, transformed into Pancho in the early 1980s, blending his interests in theater with his Hispanic heritage and a desire to work with at-risk, low-income children. He took on the mission after his teenage sister was killed in a drive-by shooting. Reyes put his own spin on Pancho, and started producing a short show that that eventually grew into a play with a 10-piece band and hip-hop dancers. Many of the performers were enlisted by Mr Reyes who met them while working in detention and community centres. He said: 'It's grown amazingly. 'Now we give out hundreds of toys, if not thousands, with other agencies and we also have a big Christmas Eve party for about 300 families ... and then on Christmas Day itself we actually go to the barrios with lowrider cars with sirens blaring ... and give out toys there.' In San Antonio Texas Pancho wears a sombrero and serape. He spends the festive season hanging out at  River Walk, and poses in front of the Alamo. His gifts are carried in a cart pulled by trusty 'burritos.' Forget Rudolph's red nose. A head donkey named ""Chuy"" leads the way for this Claus. In San Antonio, Pancho visits schools and churches to hand out gifts and turkeys with all the trimmings to 50 low-income families. And Pancho, portrayed by Rudy Martinez, has grown so popular he even has a public information officer. His spokesman Patrick Resendez, said: 'The end result is putting a smile on their face.'","The Tex Mex community has its own unique take on Father Christmas .

"The Duchess of Cambridge may have access to a collection of dazzling jewels that date back hundreds of years, but the style chameleon is famed for championing modern and fashionable designers. Last night was case in point. Kate pulled out all the stops at a glamorous black tie event at London’s Natural History Museum and accessorised her powder blue Jenny Packham gown with dazzling jewels by Monica Vinader. The 32-year-old Duchess wore the £745 Riva Diamond Cluster Drop Earrings and £1,000 Riva Diamond Cluster Bib by the jewellery designer. Scroll down for video . On trend: The Duchess of Cambridge wore dazzling jewels by Monica Vinader at last night's black tie event at the National History Museum . Other fans of the brand include fashionistas Sienna Miller, Emma Watson, Olivia Palermo, Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Cheryl Fernandez Versini. Monica Vinader is a Spanish-born British designer who mastered her craft whilst living in Santa Fe, New Mexico. After settling in Norfolk, England, Monica started her jewellery business as a bespoke service, creating one-off pieces, by hand, out of her converted forge. As the business has scaled, Norfolk remains at the heart of the design process, where she and her creative team develop all of the collections. Production takes place in India, where every stone is cut and faceted by hand from rough, using contemporary cuts, meaning your piece of Monica Vinader jewellery is entirely unique. Fashionable: The 32-year-old Duchess wore the £745 Riva Diamond Cluster Drop Earrings and Riva Diamond Cluster Bib by the jewellery designer . Famous fans: Cheryl Fernandez Versini, left, loves wearing Monica's designs on X Factor, while Sienna Miller and Poppy Delevingne, right, wore lots of pieces at Coachella . 'Monica Vinader is for everyone: easy-to-wear, contemporary pieces to style, stack and personalise with engraving,' she told MailOnline. It's hardly surprising that fashion-forward Kate is a fan of the range; acclaimed designer Caroline Issa directed the new campaign. Everything the Duchess of Cambridge wears turns to gold so Monica is sure to see sales sky rocket as a result. Classy style: Emma Watson wore Monica's pieces, which are describes as easy-to-wear, contemporary pieces to style, stack and personalise with engraving, for her UN speech . Undoubtedly the best-known item in Kate's jewellery collection is her £28,500 engagement ring, which once belonged to Princess Diana. The blue sapphire, which sparkles with 14 diamonds, was bought at the former Crown jewellers Garrard of Mayfair for a staggering £28,500. When it comes to choosing her own accessories, Kate does, however, prefer more simple pieces like her £1,090 Annoushka Pearl Drop earrings and more modest £275 Links Hope earrings. She's even a fan of cheap but chic jewellery, which she snapped up from Made In Chelsea star Amber Atherton's myflashtrash website and wore while on her Diamond Jubilee tour of the South Pacific. Kate hand-picked seven different pieces, including earrings, bracelets, and necklaces, from the company that is run by the E4 reality TV star. Founder Amber told MailOnline: 'We are over the moon that Kate has been supporting British business by wearing trinkets from myflashtrash.com.' In 2012, Kate wore a delicate pair of imitation diamond-and-pearl earrings to the Diamond Jubilee service at St Paul’s Cathedral. The £48 fake pearl and cubic zirconia earrings were part of a range of jewellery sold on her website Heavenly Necklaces - an online business selling convincing, understated fake jewels. Model choice: The ever-trendy Cara Delevingne is a huge fan of the brand and wore it at an event hosted by Kate's husband, Prince William . New look: Acclaimed designer Caroline Issa directed the new AW14 campaign . Kate's chronic antenatal sickness has meant she has not been seen in public for more than seven weeks. But last night the Duchess of Cambridge, at 13 weeks pregnant, proved she still has the power to dazzle. Earlier in the day, Kate, 32, who is expecting her second child with Prince William in April, had returned to work with a ceremonial welcome to mark the State Visit of the president of Singapore. She looked as stylish as ever – if a touch on the peaky side – as she undertook her first official engagement since early August, dressed in a made-to-measure check Alexander McQueen coat that hid any hint of her blossoming pregnancy. In her grey Jane Taylor hat and her vertiginous black Prada heels – completed with £1,090 Annoushka pearl earrings – she and William towered over the diminutive president Tony Tan Keng Yam and his wife Mary. Kate admitted she was ‘delighted to be out of the house’ after being laid low for weeks by hyperemesis gravidarum, the chronic antenatal sickness that saw her hospitalised while she was expecting her now 15-month-old son, Prince George. Back in action: All eyes were on the Duchess last night, who looked stunning in a floor length powder blue evening gown .","Kate, 32, wore Monica Vinader jewels .

"When Slaven Bilic returns to England to continue his managerial career, he won't be adopting an English approach. That's because, according to the Croat, it no longer exists. 'There’s no more English game. It’s become so cosmopolitan,' he said ahead of Thursday night's Europa League clash against Tottenham here in Istanbul. Slaven Bilic's Besiktas side welcome Tottenham to  the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul on Thursday night . Bilic (left), who played on season for West Ham in 1997, shows his frustration during a match with Everton . Bilic, pictured tackling Gianfranco Zola, moved on to play with the Toffees the following season . 'How can you talk about the English style of play when you have 20 non-British players in the 22? 'For example, I played for West Ham in 1997, we are losing to Chelsea, we had no striker because Tony Cottee was injured and Iain Dowie was injured. 'They had Zola, Vialli, we are losing 1-0, but we turn the game and we’re winning 2-1 with two minutes to go, we’re desperate for the points but Chelsea are better than us. 'Ludek Miklosko goes to take the free kick. I try to waste some time, so then I go to take it, then I tell him: ""No, you take it"". 'We waste some time, we try to waste 30 seconds and then, our crowd, they go mad and are shouting: ""Come on, any chance?!"" 'I’m thinking: ""Do you want us to stay in the Premier League?"" Then it goes 2-2 and we score again 3-2, that’s it. 'That's what was good in England. I’d like to keep that in England. 'But big clubs in England, defending for the last 15 minutes, the fans are saying: ""We are playing well, we are solid."" 'In England, that was the last resort back then. Bilic pleads his case with the referee after receiving a red card during Everton's 2-0 loss to Chelsea in 1997 . 'Now, Spain is about more open play, more attractive, over England.' His comments maybe surprise a few given he's perhaps one of the most 'English' foreigners in Premier League history. His rip-roaring, 'up and at 'em style' endeared him to Hammers fans during his time at Upton Park. But while Bilic says English football is changing - he is adamant it's changing for the better. Despite England's poor showing in last summer's World Cup, Bilic claims he saw a spark in Roy Hodgson's team that many others didn't spot. 'England? They are doing well,' said Bilic. Despite England's poor showing at the World Cup in Brazil (above), Bilic saw signs of improvement . 'Maybe in the major championships (they are not doing so well) but in the qualifiers they are doing well. 'They beat Switzerland away – a tough game for anybody. 'I watched England in the World Cup because I was writing for the Croatian papers on England. For me, I saw something in England against Italy and Uruguay that I have not seen for a long time. 'I saw energy, I saw flair, I saw passion, I saw quality up front. England had unbelievable luck those two games. But Hodgson was slaughtered. 'In 2014, I saw more energy than in 2012, 2010 or 2006, although England got past the group stages.' Could the re-introduction of a foreign manager help England progress further in competitions? 'If a foreign manager takes over England and he sees games out at the end, then you say this is not England’s game,' explained Bilic. Bilic, then coach of Croatia, celebrates with Ivica Olic (right) after his goal against Turkey in Euro 2012 . 'I don’t think that was a problem. They were just individual mistakes. I know if England come home after a week it is a disappointment but it is not that black and white.' Bilic, currently in charge of Turkish side Besiktas, comes up against Tottenham on Thursday night. A victory over Mauricio Pochettino's side will only serve to bolster his already burgeoning reputation as one of Europe's best emerging managers. And he admits returning to England appeals to him. Bilic said: 'Will I manage in the Premier League? It’s a question I get asked, not only about England. 'I like it here, I like this job, it’s a massive club. And I'm enjoying it big time. 'But of course, I would say that one day I would be interested in England, of course I would. Bilic's name was considered in the summer as West Ham contemplated replacing Sam Allardyce . 'I am not that humble or modest to say I am not a good enough coach, but I am very realistic, I am not in their league of coaches. 'If there is anyone in that league, that says I am going to go there and then there… to get a job you have to do well. 'Then your colleagues have to do bad, get sacked. And then the club has to say we want him. 'But all you can do is do well. If I can draw my career, I would rather go to England.' Perhaps, his next stop will be West Ham. His stock is high among the powers that be at Upton Park - his name was even considered in the summer as they contemplated replacing Sam Allardyce. Bilic refused to comment on speculation the Hammers sounded him out in the summer, before insisting the east London club is already in great hands under Sam Allardyce. Tottenham go through their paces on the Ataturk Olympic Stadium turf ahead of their clash with Besiktas . 'I hope they can stay there (in the top four). There is a long way to go. But you can’t talk about early days today. There are enough games,' Bilic added. 'They are doing well and Southampton. I think one of them can make it. Especially because they are improving a lot. 'West Ham were struggling last year, but they were very good in the transfer market, bought good players and kept good players last year. And it clicked. 'Big Sam knows the league like this, from Bolton and Blackburn. He was under pressure. But he got used to pressure. 'He never doubts himself, because he has done it in past. It is a big advantage if you feel something like that. You have been there.'","Slaven Bilic's Besiktas side host Tottenham in the Europa League .

"Former West Ham and Watford boss Gianfranco Zola is in the frame to take charge at his former club Cagliari, according to reports in Italy. La Gazzetta dello Sport have suggested that the 48-year-old is favourite for the job with the Serie A strugglers and could be appointed during the two-week winter break. Zeman was sacked as Cagliari manager on Tuesday morning. A statement on the club's website read: 'Cagliari Calcio announces that from now Zdenek Zeman leaves the technical guidance of the first team. Former Watford and West Ham boss Gianfranco Zola is favourite for the Cagliari job according to reports . Zdenek Zeman has been sacked by Cagliari with the club struggling in Serie A this season . 'The company would like to thank the coach and all his staff for the work done in recent months with great professionalism and dedication.' Zola, who played for Cagliari between 2003 and 2005, has not had a job since resigning from Watford in December 2013 following a poor run of form. Zeman was appointed in July and guided Cagliari to a 4-1 victory over Inter Milan in September, but the Rossoblu have won only one match in 12 subsequent fixtures. Former Italy international Zola is best known for his seven-year spell in the Premier League with Chelsea . Zola spent two seasons at West Ham United but was sacked in May 2010 after just avoiding relegation . A 3-1 defeat to Juventus last Thursday dropped Cagliari to 18th place in the league, three points adrift of safety, and the 67-year-old Zeman has paid the price for the wretched run of form. Zeman has also coached the likes of Lazio, Roma, Fenerbahce and Red Star Belgrade during his 31-year managerial career. La Gazzetta dello Sport have also mentioned Walter Zenga and Delio Rossi as candidates for the job.","Zdenek Zeman was sacked by Serie A side Cagliari on Tuesday .

"A married couple on benefits lived in a string of luxury homes before fleeing without paying rent, reports today suggest. Housing benefit claimers Amanda and Derek Finnigan, both 35, who have seven children together, have rented three luxury homes across Scotland since September 2011, it is claimed. It is alleged that in each instance, they have fled the luxurious homes without paying rent - leaving three separate landlords out of pocket. Amanda and Derek Finnigan, who are alleged to have left three rented properties without settling their arrears . Now, the couple are alleged to owe a total £21,000 in rent arrears to the home owners. But Mrs Finnigan has defended the couple's actions, saying they need large properties as they are a nine-person family and that their choice of home has 'nothing to do with luxury'. She also denies fleecing any of the landlords. She added her family have been smeared as fraudsters - and that they didn't pay rent on one property because of extensive repair costs they were forced to make. According to Daily Record, the couple moved in to their first luxury home in September 2011. Two months after tying the knot, the couple moved their family into a four-bedroom detached home in Giffnock, East Renfrewshire. The property was advertised as costing £1100-a-month. House one, a four-bedroom detached home, which costs £1,100-a-month to rent, in Giffnock, East Renfrewshrie . House two, a seven-bedroom home in Thorntonhall, South Lanarkshire, which costs £2,500-a-month . Landlord Ian Anderson claims he was forced to take legal action when the couple missed several rent payments. Mr and Mrs Finnigan left the property in July 2012 - two days before the case reached court, the landlord said. He claims the couple still owe him £6,000. The couple then moved to a seven-bedroom home in Thorntonhall, South Lanarkshire. The rent on the property was £2,500-a-month. John Campbell, who owns the property, says after paying a deposit the couple failed to pay rent for nine months. House three, a five-bedroom home in Busby, East Renfrewshire. The rent was £1,395 a month . Mrs Finnigan, who denies swindling any landlords, pictured outside the home in Busby . Mr Campbell says he eventually told the council to begin paying their housing benefit directly to him. When the pair left in April 2013 they owed him £15,000, Mr Campbell claims. But Mrs Finnigan says the family do not owe the landlord anything as they were forced to make a stream of repair costs when they lived in the property. She also says the family were harassed by Mr Campbell - a claim he strongly denies. Speaking with the newspaper, he said: 'One can only fear for the next victim. As for harassment on my part, this is complete fiction.' The couple have recently left a third property - a detached, five-bedroom home in Busby, East Renfrewshire. The rent for the property was £1,395. Landlord Nick Barrat claims the cheque the couple paid for the deposit on the property plus one month's rent bounced. The landlord says despite arranging for housing benefit to be paid directly to him, the couple owe him £3,000 in rent. Mrs Finnigan admits she owes Mr Barrat £3,000. Speaking with Sally Hind from the newspaper, Mrs Finnigan said: 'I need five bedrooms. I have seven kids. The best option for us is to stay in a private rent and find whatever surplus there is. 'It has nothing to do with luxury.' She added the family were now in the process of moving into a smaller privately rented home. Efforts are currently being made by MailOnline to speak with the Finnigans and all landlord involved.","Amanda and Derek Finnigan, both 35, accused of leaving three privately rented houses without settling outstanding rent .

"Arrested: Emery Jenkins, 38, told police that he dropped Joseph in the bath, knocking his head, a week earlier and that he had also fallen from a swing that same week . A father with a history of domestic abuse has been arrested on suspicion of killing his two-month-old son who was found beaten to death with bite marks covering his body. Emery Jenkins, who turns 38 today, was arrested after the lifeless body of his son, Joseph, was found at the family home in Deer River, Minnesota on October 16. Paramedics performed CPR on the child in a desperate bid to save his life but to no avail. He was taken to a Deer River hospital and then airlifted to St. Marys Hospital in Duluth where he died the following day. The doctor who treated him described his cause of death as a 'blunt force trauma', consistent with beating. He said the youngster suffered a skull fracture and broken ribs as well as what appeared to be bite marks on his chest, hands and feet. Jenkins told police that he dropped Joseph in the bath, knocking his head, a week earlier and that he had also fallen from a swing that same week. He explained the marks by saying a neighbour's dog had bitten him as an infant while strapped into a car seat. The child's mother, however, told authorities that Jenkins in fact bit the baby multiple times because he was crying. Jenkins wouldn’t allow the baby to go to a scheduled medical appointment because he did not want anyone to see the injuries, the complaint said. She also said they made up the story about the neighbor’s dog biting the baby. Court records showed that Jenkins has a history of domestic-related violence in Minnesota from 1995 to 2010.

"A tortoise was taken for an emergency visit to the vet after he got an electrical cable stuck under his shell. Mr T, a giant African spurred tortoise, was stretching his legs on owner Jill Johnstone's lawn when he became entangled in the cable from a garden strimmer. Fortunately, vets were able to free the cable from around the animal's neck and remove the plug that was wedged under his shell. And today Mr T was pictured back in the garden. Tangled: Mr T had the garden strimmer cable wrapped around his body and the plug wedged under his shell . Back in action: Today the tortoise was seen walking happily around Mrs Johnstone's garden . Beloved: Mrs Johnstone, pictured with her pet, got Mr T when he was the 'size of a 50p piece' Mrs Johnstone, 60, has owned Mr T, whose shell now weighs 11.7kg, 'since he was as big as a 50p piece'. She said that it was 'panic stations' when her beloved six-year-old pet got into trouble in the garden. She said: 'My son Scott was putting the strimmer away when Mr T walked over the wire and got it wrapped around his neck and the three pin plug stuck under his shell and between it and his front leg.' 'Scott was very calm but I was really panicking as we tried to pull him loose and we couldn’t get him free. 'His head was stuck outside his shell when his natural response was to try and go back into the shell which really didn’t help things.' The two had to cut the strimmer wire before rushing to vets near their home in Alfreton, Derbyshire. Vet Lisa Fotheringham: 'We had never had anything like this in the clinic before - most tortoises are smaller than Mr T and we think it was his large size that enabled this accident to happen.' Mr T was left with just minor bruising after vets and allowed home, where Mrs Johnstone's family have since been doting on him. Mrs Johnstone added: 'I wanted to make sure he was okay so I’ve been gently stroking his shell to keep him calm and shutting his eyes. 'He loves banana and soon he was back to normal munching away. In the summer he goes in and out of the house and in the winter he will come inside with me where he’l sit under his sun lamp. Stuck: The giant African spurred tortoise was walking in its owners garden when it became entangled . 'Bizarre accident': Vets were able to free Jill Johnstone's beloved six-year-old pet after the incident . Doting: Mrs Johnstone's grandchildren, six-year-old Reece and Lexi, three, are now busy looking after Mr T . 'I was really worried that they wouldn’t be able to get the wire and plug out of his shell but the vets were marvellous and I can’t thank them enough for all they did for Mr T. He’s one very lucky tortoise.' The African spurred, or sulcata, tortoise, gets its name from the 'spurs' - enlarged bony scales on its hind legs. Native to African countries including Ethiopia, Sudan and Chad - the animal lives in areas where there may be no rain for several years. In the wild they depend on succulent plants for food and water. This species of tortoise, which can live for more than 50 years, need to be carefully looked after and require specialist handling and treatment, otherwise they can suffer painful and potentially fatal diseases.","Mr T, a giant African spurred tortoise, was walking on his owner's lawn .

"When I was asked to try the new product from Coca-Cola - I knew I would be instantly transported back down nostalgia lane to my childhood. Daily Mail Australia was offered an exclusive taste test of the soft drink giant's new beverage for the slightly more health conscious consumers out there known as 'balance-seekers'. A can of Coca-Cola Life boasts 35 per cent less sugar thanks to the introduction of the natural sweetener Stevia - meaning it only contains 290 calories compared to the classic can's 450 calories. Scroll down for video . Coke Life only contains 290 calories compared to the Classic Coke can which has 450 calories . Rosie Huntington-Whiteley launched Coca-Cola Life - sweetened from natural sources with a blend of sugar and Stevia leaf extract - in London in September . Coke Life for the 'balance-seekers' 'Coke Life is absolutely about not only keeping pace with consumer needs and demands but hopefully trying to out-pace them,' Coca-Cola Group Marketing Manager Dianne Everett said. The gleaming green can almost looks like an impersonator next to the traditional colours of the red, white, black and silver branding across the three others kinds of Coke. Coca-Cola Group Marketing Manager Dianne Everett said the colour was chosen to stand out above its carbonated competitors. 'It's really about making sure we stand out on shelf with something that’s vibrant so that we are clearly positioning ourself as yet another vibrant addition to the Coke family - and it also compliments the rest of the family,' she said. Trying the new Coke was a serious blast from the past for me as it was designed to taste like the classic product which I haven't had for probably for the best part of three decades. Never having been much of a soft drink fan, I compared the can of Life to the Zero product which is marketed towards men who aren't enticed by Diet version. As subtle as it may be - I felt that Coke Life tasted more like the real deal than Zero - which has no sugar but contains the controversial artificial sweetener Aspartame - as does Diet Coke. Coca-Cola Group Marketing Manager Dianne Everett says the soft drink giant was under no illusion that its products were considered as part of a health range . Just before tasting Coke Life, I wrote a story on buses needing to increase the load limit by two tonnes to cater for the fact that Australian's waistlines have expanded almost 20 per cent between 1989 and 2012. Aloysa Hourigan from Nutrition Australia mentioned to Daily Mail Australia that although the statistics were not surprising - she hoped that a downward trend of junk food consumption in America would be picked up Down Under. 'There are little glimmers of hope around such as in the U.S where the consumption of McDonald's and Coca Cola has been decreasing and their sales are dropping,' she said. 'Perhaps it will be a bit of a trend that might reflect back eventually on weight loss but it takes time to see those changes.' Ms Everett expressed that the multi-million dollar international company had never marketed its products as a healthy range. 'We don’t attempt to market Coca Cola or any of our products - and certainly not even our latest in the line with Coke Life - as a health drink,’ she said. ‘We are under no illusions we are operating in that space.' 'We are a fun great tasting drink that people consume on occasions that are relevant to them.' Coca-Cola Life uses a mix of sugar and natural plant Stevia, which has been in Japan as a sweetener for over 30 years . 'We truly believe obesity is a very complex issue and the causes of which are multi-factorial and our responsibility in this current environment is we want to continue to provide range and choice,' Ms Everett said. 'Consumers ultimately decide the kind of portions, sizes and flavours that they are seeking which is all part of what we think we need to do to have that responsible social footprint.' Set to be launched in New Zealand and Australia in April next year, Coca Cola Life has already been launched in America, the U.K. and Argentina - where the product actually has an astounding 60 per cent less sugar to cater to that particular South American market. Whether the die-hard Aussie Coke fans will embrace the new Coca Cola Life remains to be green.... I mean seen.","Coca Cole Life is being launched in Australia in April next year .

"A vest which can carry up to 7kg in weight and which has 22 nifty pockets for 'essentials' has become a hit with shoppers who are using it instead of paying for carrier bags. The 'Bagket' – advertised as a bag and jacket in one – has been loaded up with grocery items by shoppers in Glasgow, Scotland, who are using it instead of paying 5p for plastic bags. The unusual jacket, which costs nearly £70, can hold a two litre bottle of milk, a litre bottle of orange juice and a 750ml bottle of bleach, as well as grocery 'essentials' such as eggs, apples, cereal, bread and butter. Scroll down for video . Shopper John Paul Breslin, who used his jacket to carry his groceries home from Tesco in Finnieston, Glasgow, managed to squeeze in dozens of 'essentials' including milk, bread, butter, apples, eggs and bananas . Originally designed for travellers who want to beat excessive airport baggage charges by 'wearing' their luggage through customs, the 'Bagket' has become popular for a whole other reason. John Paul Breslin, who used his jacket to carry his grocery shopping home from Tesco in Finnieston, Glasgow, said he had 'taken on the problems of the new bag charge and emerged victorious'. Shops and supermarkets in Scotland now charge customers for plastic carrier bags, as part of a bid to encourage sustainable behaviour and cut down on environmental waste. Wales and Northern Ireland also charge shoppers 5p for carrier bags, and England is set to follow suit in October next year. Mr Breslin, who said the jacket was 'comfortable', stuffed the waistcoat's front pockets full of goods including milk, orange juice and a bottle of bleach. He used two large mesh pockets, just inside the front of the jacket, to store a packet of six apples, a loaf of bread and a 500g tub of butter. In a handy pouch at the back of jacket, he managed to tuck away a box of cereal and a French baguette, while a strap on the shoulder was the perfect place for a bunch of bananas. He also managed to fit a box of cereal, a French baguette, a one litre bottle of orange juice, chocolate powder, two toilet rolls and some chocolate bars into the unusual waistcoat which is called a 'Bagket' and costs £69.99 . Shops and supermarkets in Scotland have joined Northern Ireland and Wales in charging 5p for plastic bags . Pouches on the front and sides of the jacket made room for a tub of drinking chocolate powder, two toilet rolls and a packet of eggs. And he also managed to squeeze in some bars of chocolate. He said: 'It was clear as I made my way home with my shopping that I'd gotten the attention of my fellow shoppers. 'I could see them smiling in appreciation of my ingenuity as I passed them. 'I imagine it won't be long before you're all wearing a similar garment.' A spokesman for Bagket Limited, the company behind the £69.99 waistcoat, said she was delighted shoppers were using the jacket to store their grocery goods. She said: 'We've had a lot of comments from customers telling us all the different uses they have found for Bagket, but a full grocery shop has certainly been one of the most impressive.'","Bagket - a bag and jacket - can carry up to 7kg and has 22 pockets in total .

"A day out for Muslim families had to be cancelled at Legoland after staff and children were threatened by far-right extremists. The theme park in Windsor, Berkshire, had been hired out exclusively to Haitham al-Haddad, who is said to be among the top 25 radical preachers in Britain. More than one thousand Muslim families were expected to attend at a cost of around £100,000. Tickets would have cost around £17 each. Fun day: Haitham al-Haddad had hired the theme park exclusively for a day of 'halal activities'. Al-Haddad, who leads the Muslim Research and Development Foundation (MRDF), based in Tower Hamlets, had booked the children’s park for a day of ‘halal entertainment’ on March 9. But after being inundated with abusive and offensive phone calls, emails and posts on social media, bosses at the amusement park decided to cancel the event. One Neo-Nazi group wrote that it would make police in Thames Valley their 'b****' and that threatening children 'rocks'. The post on the group's Facebook page also said: ‘My dad would be so proud if he knew I existed #itsgreatbeingus’ Members of the English Defence League were also said to have been involved. A spokeswoman for Legoland told MailOnline the neo-Nazi group also posted a picture of one of their Muslim workers on Facebook with an offensive comment. She added the extent of the abuse led Legoland to take down its Facebook page for a week. The decision to cancel the event completely was made on the advice of police after no guarantees for the safety of staff and guests could be made. One staff member at Legoland said that they were 'appalled' at the outcome and blamed misinformation 'fuelled by a small group with a clear agenda.' She added: 'The LEGOLAND Windsor Resort prides itself on welcoming everyone to our wonderful attraction; however due to unfortunate circumstances the private event scheduled for Sunday March 9 will no longer take place. ‘This was an incredibly difficult decision made after discussions with the organisers and Thames Valley Police, following the receipt of a number of threatening phone calls, emails and social media posts to the resort over the last couple of weeks. ‘These alone have led us to conclude that we can no longer guarantee the happy fun family event which was envisaged, or the safety of our guests and employees on that day – which is always our number one priority.’ Target: Staff at Legoland were threatened by far-right group after it emerged that the park had been booked out. Day trip: More than 1,000 Muslim families were to attend the day costing around £100,000. She said: ‘Sadly it is our belief that deliberate misinformation fuelled by a small group with a clear agenda was designed expressly to achieve this outcome. ‘We are appalled at what has occurred, and at the fact that the real losers in this are the many families and children who were looking forward to an enjoyable day out. ‘We would like to apologise to them and to the organisers, and to thank them for their understanding.’ Thames Valley Police are investigating reports of the offences under the Malicious Communications Act. A police spokesman added: ‘As there is an ongoing police investigation it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.’ The Muslim Research and Development Foundation could not be reached for a comment. The MRDF's leader al-Haddad was reported to be on a list of 25 extremist clerics identified by security chiefs and Downing Street as candidates for anti-extremism Asbo banning orders. He has spoken in favour of a form of female genital mutilation, although he recognises it is illegal in Britain, and following the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011, he wrote because he was a Muslim he would ""enter paradise"". Legoland has previously hosted several exclusive parties and celebrities such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as well as David and Victoria Beckham.","Radical Muslim cleric Haitham al-Haddad booked Legoland so Muslims could enjoy day of 'halal entertainment' on March 9 .

"A million-dollar haunted house attraction at the Perth Royal Show based on the notorious London mental health institute  has been forced into a last-minute name and theme change after a backlash from mental health groups. The Royal Agricultural Society of Western Australia has confirmed the ‘Bethlem Sanatorium’ will be renamed as ‘Mayhem Manor’ and rather than feature actors playing the mentally ill patients, it will now offer the more mundane zombie contagion. This is despite the attraction being created over  six years. Architect Leonard Pickel said the theme had nothing to do with the modern day mental health institute . The Bethlem Sanatorium ride was based on one of the world’s oldest mental institutes, the Bethlem Royal Hospital, which was founded as a hospital in the 13th century, located in Beckenham of south London. The haunted house style exhibition had initial plans to feature an open ward with 23 rooms filled with actors dressed in hospital gowns and scrubs. But executive director of Consumers of Mental Health, Shauna Gaebler told Daily Mail Australia that it was unacceptable to host attractions that misinterpret people with mental health issues as an object of fear, humour and entertainment. The million dollar attraction at the Perth Royal Show of a haunted house based on the notorious London mental health institute has changed its theme after a backlash from mental health groups . 'I was horrified by the inclusion of the exhibition at the show, which  was offensive and stigmatising to people with lived experience of mental health challenges. ‘We also considered the exhibition would encourage people with mental health issues to be viewed as a tourist attraction and as an object of fun for the general public, just as they were in the 1600s. ‘We want a family fun event but not to an extent of confronting vulnerable members of the community or have people laughing at it and treating it as a joke.'

The ‘Bethlem Sanatorium’ will be renamed as ‘Mayhem Manor’ and will subject around the outbreak of a deadly contagion . Architect Leonard Pickel said the initial theme had nothing to do with the modern day mental health institute . Ms Gaebler said that with an estimated 400,000 people attending the Royal Show each year, exhibitions such as the Bethlem Sanatorium had the potentials to send the wrong message to the community in regards people with mental health challenges. ‘We are pleased that the Royal Agricultural Society has listened to our views and made changes to this attraction,' she said. 'The zombie themed horror show is a lot better than actors playing patients in hospital gowns while yelling and screaming and the outcome is a real win for people with mental health issues.' The exhibition will no longer feature actors playing mentally ill patients but is set to provide some frightening zombies instead .

Architect Leonard Pickel said the initial theme had nothing to do with the modern day mental health institute . The Bethlem Sanatorium architect Leonard Pickel told Daily Mail Australia that the theme had nothing to do with the modern day mental health institute. ‘It's disappointing but we’re happy to change and go a different direction because we didn’t want to push anyone away or get people upset and offended,' he said. ‘We wanted to shine the light on the sanatorium during a historical time of the horrible and the frightening condition when patients were horrendously treated and the hospital was underfunded and wasn't well managed. 'We were really gentle with the theme and it was a theatrical literature for everyone to experience an actual place in time but in a safer environment. 'It's probably the best haunted house I've made - nothing like Australia has ever seen and I'm looking forward for people to come and see.' The Royal show spokeswoman Maryanne Shaddick told Daily Mail Australia that there were no intentions to cause offence and the exhibit was not about mental health issues. 'It's a haunted house thrill attraction with sophisticated special effects and people should see it before drawing any conclusions,’ she said. ‘It’s a family event, with a range of entertainment for all ages and we encourage everyone to attend this weekend.’ Executive director of Consumers of Mental Health Shauna Gaebler said an estimated 400,000 people attend the Royal Show each year .

"Happy: Amber Vinson, 29, smiled today at a press conference after being declared Ebola-free . The second nurse who caught Ebola while treating the disease in an American hospital received a phone call today from President Obama. Vinson, 29, who was one of two women to catch Ebola from Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who first brought the disease to the United States, was released from hospital today disease-free. Vinson didn't take any questions at Emory University Hospital. Instead she read a statement thanking God, her relatives and her doctors, appealed for privacy as she returns home to Texas, and asked 'that we not lose focus on the thousands of families who labor under the burden of this disease in West Africa.' Another nurse, held for days in a medical tent in New Jersey after volunteering in West Africa, was in an undisclosed location in Maine, objecting to quarantine rules as overly restrictive. While world leaders appeal for more doctors and nurses on the front lines of the Ebola epidemic, health care workers in the United States are finding themselves on the defensive. Lawyers now represent both Amber Vinson, who contracted the virus while caring for a Liberian visitor to Texas, and Kaci Hickox, who is challenging the mandatory quarantines some states are imposing on anyone who came into contact with Ebola victims. The virus is still spreading faster than the response, killing nearly half of the more than 10,000 people it has infected in West Africa. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said Tuesday that at least 5,000 more health workers are urgently needed in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, traveling with him in Africa, said mandatory quarantines for health care workers, Ebola-related travel restrictions and border closings are not the answer. The Pentagon announced Tuesday that the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that he require all U.S. troops returning from Ebola-fighting missions in West Africa to be kept in supervised isolation for 21 days. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Vinson wipes her eyes after thanking the doctors and nurses who helped save her from Ebola . Joy: Vinson hugs Emory University Hospital epidemiologist Dr. Bruce Ribner, as she leaves a press conference after being discharged . Balancing that and similar quarantines announced by several state governors, President Barack Obama said the Ebola response needs to be 'based on science.' 'We've got to make sure that those workers who are willing and able and dedicated to go over there in a really tough job, that they're applauded, thanked and supported. That should be our priority. And we can make sure that when they come back they are being monitored in a prudent fashion,' Obama said after calling Vinson from the White House. Vinson's trip home to join her bridesmaids for wedding preparations was one of several moves by doctors and nurses that could have exposed others in the United States. In Ohio alone, 163 people were still being monitored Tuesday because of contact or potential contact with Vinson in a bridal shop and on the airplanes she used. Pulled through: Vinson and Dr Ribner celebrate at the press conference following her all-clear . Vinson arrived in Dallas on Tuesday evening, after tests showed she is now free of the virus. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said voluntary stay-at-home measures were obviously insufficient, since even doctors and nurses had moved around in public before getting sick. He was among the first to announce mandatory 21-day quarantines for anyone who had contact with possibly infected people. Vinson, 29, was infected while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, who died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas on October 8. She inserted catheters, drew blood, and dealt with Duncan's body fluids, all while wearing protective gear. Before: Vinson, 29, is pictured above during her Ebola treatment at Emory University Hospital in Atlatna . Ebola fears: Vinson (pictured on a stretcher) was rushed off of a plane after reporting a fever on her way home from Cleveland, Ohio . Moved: Medics are seen above moving Vinson to Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, this month . Dr. Bruce Ribner, an infectious disease expert who oversaw Vinson's recovery at Emory University Hospital, said her doctors in Atlanta don't know how she got infected in Dallas. He released no details about her treatment and wouldn't say whether certain drugs are proving more effective. 'The honest answer is we're not exactly sure,' he said. But Emory University Hospital spokeswoman Holly Korschun later confirmed that Vinson received blood plasma from Ebola survivor Kent Brantly, and said Ebola survivor Nancy Writebol also donated her plasma, but it wasn't ultimately needed. Ebola is only contagious when people who carry the virus get sick, and Vinson didn't show symptoms before flying to Ohio on Oct. 10. She reported her temperature to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as required, on Oct. 13, and was cleared to fly back to Dallas. The next day, she developed a temperature, and on Oct. 15, she tested positive for Ebola. Another nurse, Nina Pham, also was infected by Duncan, and was released Oct. 24 from the National Institutes of Health. Recovered: Nina Pham, 26, was recently declare Ebola free, and got a hug from President Obama when she visited the White House. He will speak later on the continuing fight against the disease . Complaints: Kaci Hickox, another nurse, is currently in isolation thanks to new Ebola quarantine rules . Hickox, the Doctors Without Borders volunteer, was staying meanwhile in an 'undisclosed location,' said Steve Hyman, one of her lawyers. Maine health officials announced she will be quarantined at home for 21 days after the last possible exposure to the disease, following the state's health protocols. But Hyman said he expected her to remain in seclusion for the 'next day or so' while he discusses her situation with Maine health officials. Hyman said the state should follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, which require only monitoring, not quarantine, for health care workers who show no symptoms after treating Ebola patients. 'She's a very good person who did very good work and deserves to be honored, not detained, for it,' he said.","Vinson, 29, was released today and appeared at press conference .

"Doctors have saved all four of an expecting mom's quadruplets in an operation that experts have branded 'miraculous'. Ashley and Tyson Gardner captured the nation's emotions with their news that she was pregnant with quadruplets after spending eight years trying to conceive - a one in 70 million chance. But on Monday, it emerged that one set of twins had contracted twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) - a condition which affects identical twins, causing an unequal flow of blood between the twins. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Delight: After hours of grueling surgery, Ashley and Tyson Gardner have celebrated as all four babies are safe . Fears: They were rushed to Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital on Monday when doctors saw that one set of twins could be losing blood and Ashley appeared to be approaching labor at just 19 weeks of pregnancy . The couple was flown to a specialist center at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where Ashley was admitted for surgery on Tuesday. Tonight, after hours of surgery, the couple revealed on Facebook that doctors have recorded steady heartbeats for all four of the unborn babies. They added: 'God is GOOD! Prayers have been answered!! Miracles continue to take place. ALL the babies survived the surgery, they heard 4 heartbeats today! We want to thank all of you for being part of our miracle!! We don't know how to say THANK YOU enough!! xoxo' 'We haven't slept much the past few days,' Tyson told ABC News. He said doctors told his wife she needed immediate surgery after it appeared her cervix had started to open and she could be going into early labor. On Wednesday, doctors performed the emergency surgery to more equally divert blood flow between one set of the Gardner twins. 'Today, we're doing much better,' he said. 'The last few days have been really rough ... very scary.' Ashley Gardner, a Utah woman (pictured here recently) who captured the nation with her news that she was pregnant with quadruplets after spending eight years trying to conceive has been rushed to hospital for emergency surgery - it was a success according to the family . Ashley pictured in a photo last week at 19 weeks. According to a Facebook page which updates their followers Ashley and Tyson Gardner, from Utah, flew to see a specialist surgeon in California yesterday following a meeting with their doctor about their two sets of identical twins . The family posted this message to their Facebook today after the successful surgery . The couple also found out that Ashley's cervix is opening prematurely as a result of the condition. Ashley underwent surgery today and was given 'meds to halt any contraction that might occur.' A few hours later the anxious family revealed the surgery went well. They posted on Facebook: 'It went great. Dr. Chmait smiled and said, 'This has been a good day!' Our tears have been replaced with relief and continue to pray for the babies safety and continued 'baking' for a good long time!! Stunned: This is the moment Ashley and Tyson Gardner, for Utah, found out they were having quadruplets in the summer after spending eight years trying to conceive. Above, Mrs Gardner stares at the screen in the ultrasound . 70-million-to-one odds: The couple were delighted to learn their first round of IVF was successful in July following a long battle with infertility. But they were later stunned to discover they were having four babies . Caught on camera: Their incredible reaction to the news was captured in hospital by friend Alicia Hallock . Twin to twin transfusion is caused by an abnormal connecting of blood vessels in the twins' shared placenta which results in an imbalance of blood flow from one twin to the other. It affects approximately 15% of identical twins who share the same placenta. One twin is often larger than the other twin and receives more blood than usual from the placenta. This can put a strain on the baby's heart and makes this twin produce more urine than normal, resulting in extra fluid around the baby, within the amniotic sac. This can be uncomfortable for the mother and also increases the risk to the pregnancy by causingpremature labour due to the extra pressure on the neck of the womb (cervix). The other twin is usually smaller and may become anaemic due to receiving less blood from the placenta. The treatments for TTTS pregnancies depend, in part, on when in pregnancy the twins become affected. If the twins are mature enough to survive outside the womb (beyond 25 weeks), immediate delivery is an option for TTTS babies. Fetal laser surgery may be done to stop the flow of blood from one twin to the other. Another treatment is amnioreduction -  a procedure whereby fluid is taken from around the twin with polyhydramnios to try and prevent premature delivery. A needle is passed through the abdomen into the sac of the recipient twin and fluid removed. Source: Liverpool Women's NHS . 'Ashley will be put on bed rest from here on out. They then posted: 'The doctor just came out and said the babies are cured of twin to twin transfusion... he said that part couldn't have gone better!!!' Twin to twin transfusion is caused by an abnormal connecting of blood vessels in the twins' shared placenta which results in an imbalance of blood flow from one twin to the other. It affects approximately 15% of identical twins who share the same placenta and treatments can include surgery. The couple hit the headlines a few weeks ago when a video of the moment they found out they were having quadruplets after spending eight years trying to conceive went viral. They were delighted to learn their first round of IVF was successful in July following a long battle with infertility. But when they attended their first ultrasound, they were stunned to discover they were expecting four babies - at odds of 70 million to one. Their incredible reaction to the news was captured in hospital by their friend, Alicia Hallock, and later uploaded online. Footage shows the couple gazing open-mouthed at the screen, before Mrs Gardner places her hand on her forehead and breathes out. The pair then start laughing in delight, while the mother-to-be holds up scans of her four babies. Speaking to CNN, Mrs Gardner, who suffers from endometriosis - a condition which sees cells from the lining of the womb grow in other areas of the body - said she was shocked but excited to discover she was pregnant with quadruplets. 'I couldn't think straight. I had never been so excited and terrified in the same instant. We waited so long to have babies so we were so happy,' she said. 'But at that time we literally had never even thought once about this being a possibility. We didn't know anything about having quads and the risks that go with it. But overall, we were just excited.' She added that her doctor 'didn't believe it' when he learned the news from the ultrasound technician - and asked her to come back the following week so he could 'see for himself'.

Happy: Before getting pregnant, Mrs Gardner said she had spent eight years trying 'everything' to counter the fertility problems caused by her condition, which can also result in intense pain. Above, the Gardners . Before getting pregnant, Mrs Gardner spent eight years trying 'everything' to counter the fertility problems caused by her condition, which can also result in intense pain. She adopted a specific diet, underwent a laparoscopy, took medication and had four failed rounds of intrauterine insemination, before finally saving up for IVF. 'My endometriosis was so bad that we found during the IVF process that it had compromised my eggs. They all started dying off and left us with one perfect egg and one good egg,' she said. 'They put both back to give me the best odds of one sticking. The chances of even getting one to stick was 40 per cent. To have both stick and both split... well, that's a one-in-70 million chance!' But despite her joy, Mrs Gardner said she is aware of the risks involved in her pregnancy, writing on Facebook: 'I am extremely high risk and things can change at a moments notice for us.'

"Builders who had not been paid for a month beat their employers to death as revenge and then buried their bodies in a shallow grave before covering it with concrete. Timur Priznavsiesa, 30, and Rustam Karimov, 28, from Uzbekistan were working near the village of Mihailovo-Yartesevskaya in Western Russia's New Moscow region. When they went more than a month without being paid, and their Russian employers repeatedly came up with excuses to delay handing over the cash, they hatched a plan to take revenge.

After leaving the site at the end of their shift, the pair went back inside where they confronted boss Constantine Lazarev, 45, and the foreman Artem Bykov, 30. But when the pair refused to pay, the workers attacked them, beating them to death with shovels before dragging their bodies to wasteland near the site, digging graves and throwing them inside. They then poured concrete over them so they would not be found. However, the bodies were found a week later by police looking for clues as to the disappearance of the men.

"A 16-week-old baby died from catastrophic head injuries after being attacked by one of her parents, a court heard today. Paris Vince-Stephens was either shaken to death or suffered a blow to the head at the hands of one of her parents, William Stephens or Danah Vince, prosecutors allege. The injuries were so severe that Paris died in hospital three days after collapsing at her home in the Brentry area of Bristol in January this year. Four-month-old Paris died from head injuries after either being shaken or suffering a blow to the head . Bristol Crown Court was told that it was either Stephens, 25, or his 19-year-old girlfriend Vince who inflicted the fatal blow upon their baby daughter. Stephens, of Southmead, Bristol and Vince, of Portishead, north Somerset, both deny charges of manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child. Christopher Quinlan QC, prosecuting, told the jury of eight men and four women: '[Paris] had catastrophic and fatal head injuries.' He said she was admitted to Bristol Children's Hospital on January 11, 2013, but died three days later as there was nothing more doctors could do for her. Mr Quinlan told the court: 'The prosecution case is that one of these defendants, the mother or the father, caused those injuries by shaking her or by bringing her head into contact with a soft surface or a combination of both.' Her parents, Danah Vince, 19, . (left) and William Stephens (right), both deny charges of manslaughter . and causing or allowing the death of a child . Mr Quinlan told the court that the . defendant who did not inflict the fatal injuries was culpable of causing . or allowing the death of a child and failing to take steps to protect . Paris. Mr Quinlan said that both defendants denied responsibility for killing Paris when interviewed by the police. 'Mr Stephens said he was not responsible and said he ""didn’t touch her at all"" that day,' the prosecutor said. 'When Danah Vince was questioned she denied responsibility. She said she had left Paris alone for a short period with Paris’s father William Stephens. 'She was fine, said Miss Vince, but much different when she returned. She, Danah Vince, didn’t shake Paris - it must have been William, she said.' Mr Quinlan said the young parents had a 'volatile' relationship. They also used drugs, including cannabis, jurors were told. He told the court that Stephens would be violent towards his girlfriend and she would be violent to him as well. Vince told police that Stephens once assaulted her with a dog chain while she was pregnant. He said social services stepped in and the couple signed agreements of no domestic violence. But, even though Stephens was supposed . to stay away from Vince, the court heard there was evidence he was . still living with Vince at her flat. Court told Stephens (right) and Vince (left) had a 'volatile' relationship and violently fought on day Paris collapsed . Mr . Quinlan said a student social worker then took on the case, before . Stephens appeared before Bristol magistrates following a disturbance at . the flat and was handed a restraining order to keep away. Neighbours would often hear doors slamming, shouting and sobbing coming from their flat - sometimes being woken in the middle of the night by arguments. The court also heard that both used drugs and according to Stephens' uncle, Andrew Wall, his nephew could be violent over drugs. 'He could get violent and snappy if he couldn't get hold of any,' Mr Quinlan said. Vince's mother, Lisa Vince, said Stephens had punched and pushed her while under the influence of drugs. Mr Wall also said Vince could also be violent when she wanted drugs. The prosecutor told the court that on the day Paris was injured, the couple had a violent row over a missing £10 note. Mr Quinlan said: 'He, William Stephens, grabbed [Vince] and pushed her onto the sofa and hit her in the face. She pushed him off and the dog bit him.' Paris was taken to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children in January but died three days later . Later that morning Vince left Paris with Stephens while she went to an appointment at her doctor's surgery. Mr Quinlan said that Vince went to get cannabis and toilet roll from a neighbour at around 4.15pm - leaving Paris with Stephens. 'Danah Vince told [the neighbour] that Paris was not well and making, as she described, really scary cries,' Mr Quinlan said. A 12-year-old neighbour told police that he heard Stephens and Vince shouting at each other and swearing as he played on his games console after coming home from school that afternoon. Paramedics were called at 4.40pm and suspected Paris had suffered a brain injury, the court was told. Shortly after midnight on January 12, Vince sent a text message to her boyfriend's mother, Marie Stephens, which said: 'Tell Will to tell the police if they come he came to my flat for an hour. Ran over road for five minutes. Paris in cot and stayed in cot and nothing happened. Okay? Still in a bad way.' Mr Quinlan asked: 'Are those the actions of an innocent mother beside herself with worry with a sick child? 'Or the actions of a person who knew what happened? Was it her that inflicted the injuries and was asking the Mr Stephens to tell the police nothing happened?' Two hours later, Vince sent a text message to a friend, which said: 'She's really bad. I left her with Will for five minutes and now she's dying. I really can't cope. They did the test and that's what it said.' When doctors told Vince that Paris had suffered 'irreversible and catastrophic brain injuries; she replied: 'I want him done for manslaughter.' Mr Quinlan added: 'Asked if she had seen anything happen, she said no and added ""My mistake was letting him in"". A clear reference to William Stephens.' Before Mr Quinlan began the prosecution’s case, trial judge Mr Justice Teare told the jury that Stephens would be assisted in the dock by an intermediary because he suffered from 'severe communication difficulties'. The judge explained that because of Stephens’ difficulties there would be regular breaks in the proceedings. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.

"A top Tory has accused GPs of ‘moaning’ so much they are putting off new recruits. Health minister Lord Howe said ‘a lot’ of the problems recruiting family doctors was because of the ‘perceptions of general practice’. Labour said blaming doctors for the crisis of recruitment to GP surgeries was a ‘new low’ for the Government. Conservative health minister Lord Howe said 'moaning' GPs were partly to blame for the recruitment crisis . Lord Howe made the remarks at a fringe event at the Tory party conference in Birmingham last week. It risks undermining the move by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron to mend fences with NHS workers in the run up to the general election. The Tories are currently trailing Labour by more than 20 percentage points in the polls on which party is most trusted to safeguard the NHS. Lord Howe’s outspoken attack comes amid warnings from the Royal College of GPs over the growing pressure on doctors’ surgeries. The body representing GPs said the government’s plan to open surgeries seven days a week, 12 hours a day, risked overwhelming an already-stretched service. It called for thousands more GPs to be hired and more cash to keep surgeries open for longer. The British Medical Association has also warned that waits of one or two weeks to see a doctor are ‘becoming the norm’. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Lord Howe's remarks were a 'new low' The number of family doctors has fallen since the coalition came to power and the take-up of training places is the worst since 2007. But Lord Howe said family doctors themselves were part of the problem. He said: ‘A lot of this depends on perceptions of general practice. ‘The more people start sort of moaning about how difficult it is to be a GP, the more you'll put off aspiring young doctors. ‘So my message to the royal college… is very gently to say: let's have a narrative that says general practice is one of the most rewarding careers you can have in medicine, and … this is a solvable problem, the strains in general practice are a solvable problem.’ Lord Howe said there would be extra funding by 2020 to provide an extra 4,900 GPs. At its party conference, Labour promised at its conference to invest in 8,000 more GPs. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused the Tories of trying to blame GPs for problems of their own making. He said: ‘Ministers in this government always seek to blame others for their own failings. But to have a senior minister blaming “moaning” GPs for the GP recruitment crisis is a new low even for them. ‘Lord Howe has admitted in private what ministers have so far publicly refused to accept – that some rural and inner city areas have suffered disproportionate cuts and that people are having to wait far too long for appointments.’","Lord Howe said 'a lot' of problems in recruitment because of 'perceptions'

"'I never read any of the first . editions. If I wanted to, I would go out and buy a paperback version,' says collector . A pensioner who did not touch his precious library of rare books for 30 years is to be rewarded for his patience when it sells for an expected £1million at auctioneers Bloomsbury of London later this month. Clive Hirschhorn, 72, has amassed one of the world’s finest collections of first edition books, which reads more like a Who’s Who of 20th century fiction. The retired theatre critic, from Midhurst, Sussex, knew the value of the books relied upon the condition of the original dust-jackets and so has hardly removed them from the shelves over the years. Scroll down for video . Casino Royale: Set to fetch Mr Hirschhorn £10,000-£15,000 at auction at the end of the month . Rare edition: Harper Lee's To Kill A Mocking Bird is expected to sell for £1,000-£1,500 . Nice catch: Catcher in the Rye should be worth £4,000-£6,000 . If he wanted to read one, he bought a paper back version as the slightest blemish or tear on the jackets would have knocked hundreds of pounds off their price. Mr Hirschhorn has now decided to part with his collection of about 500 books that he bought from second-hand shops and private dealers around the world. A first edition copy of the literary classic The Great Gatsby he paid £1,500 for in 1987 is being tipped to sell for a staggering £75,000. One of the earliest versions of Ian Fleming’s first James Bond novel Casino Royale that still has a first-issue dust-jacket is valued at £15,000. Great value: F Scott Fitzgerald's classic The Great Gatsby may fetch £75,000 . Golden: William Golding's Lord of The Flies is valued at between £8,000-£12,000 . Classic: Brighton Rock, by Graham Greene, could be worth as much as £60,000 . An excellent copy of Graham Greene’s book Brighton Rock that has a ‘near-fine’ jacket has a pre-sale estimate of £60,000. First editions of this book are extremely rare as a warehouse fire destroyed most of them in 1938. Dashiell Hammett’s The Maltese Falcon is set to sell for £50,000 while a first edition of William Golding’s Lord Of The Flies is valued at £12,000. King's speech: Author Stephen King has signed the book for Mr Hirschhorn, saying 'Best wishes, and shine on!'. The book may fetch £1,200-£1,800 . The world of crime is represented by a £3,000 . early copy of Agatha Christie’s 1932 work Peril At End House while four . volumes of AA Milne’s The Christopher Robin Books are expected to fetch . £10,000. Mr Hirschhorn managed to get a number of his books signed by the authors, with Stephen King writing ‘shine on’ in the front of a first edition copy of The Shining. Harper Lee’s classic To Kill A Mocking Bird, John le Carre’s Call For The Dead and Margaret Mitchell’s Gone With The Wind are tipped to sell for a total of £27,000. Mr Hirschhorn said he stopped collecting about three years ago and is now selling the books to help fund his retirement. He said: 'I started the collection in 1984 after I read a newspaper article about first edition books while on a bus. 'After that it was like a virus or infection that was in my blood and I couldn’t pass a second-hand bookshop without going in to look for first editions. 'I always had with me a useful price guide telling me how much each book was worth and I would always pay less than that price. 'But with first editions, the condition of the dust-jacket is everything. 'I never read any of the first editions, if I wanted to I would go out and buy a paperback version. Any mark or tear on the jacket would take hundreds or thousands off the value. 'I kept them on shelves in my bedroom well out of the sunlight. As I used to say, they were for show not for blow. 'It is quite extraordinary just how much in value some of them have gone up by. Going, going, gone: Margaret Mitchell's classic Gone with the Wind is worth £6,000-£8,000 . Rare: Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier has been valued at between £3,000-£4,000 . The big pay day: Raymond Chandler's American classic The Big Sleep should fetch £8,000 . The record for the most expensive printed book sold at auction is a complete first edition of The Birds Of America by John James Audubon (right), which was sold at Sotheby's in London in December 2010 for £7.1m. A rare first edition copy of the book Ulysses by James Joyce sold for £275,000 in 2009, the highest price recorded for a 20th Century first edition. 'I paid about £1,500 for the Great Gatsby in 1987 which wasn’t an inconsiderable sum at all but it could sell for about £100,000 now. 'It is possibly one of the most iconic of all American novels and was turned into a film three times.' Mr . Hirschhorn said it was now costing more and more money to insure his . library and he hopes to use some of the proceeds to buy a new flat to . rent out. One of his smartest investments was paying about £120 pounds for To Kill A Mocking Bird which is now worth 100 times that amount. Rupert Powell, the deputy chairman of auctioneers Bloomsbury of London, said: 'This is one of the most important private collections of modern first editions to come onto the market the last ten years. 'A particularly remarkable aspect is the near-perfect condition of the original dust-jackets, and this will appeal to all true collectors.' Other rare first editions in the sale include Ernest Hemingway’s A Farewell To Arms, Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca and John Steinbeck’s The Grapes Of Wrath and Bram Stoker’s Dracula.

"A rare, nearly flawless copy of Superman's comic-book debut has sold for a super-powered price: $3.2 million. New York comics dealers Stephen Fishler and Vincent Zurzolo said Monday they submitted Sunday's record-setting bid in the eBay auction for Action Comics No. 1, the 1938 book in which the superhero first appeared. It's believed to be the highest price ever paid for a comic book, surpassing $2.1 million for a similarly high-quality copy of the same book in 2011. 'It's hard to believe that a kid's 10-cent comic could be worth that much money, but it is Superman. That's an iconic thing,' Fishler said. 'It's the first time anybody saw what a superhero was like.' EBay confirmed the price but said it couldn't yet disclose the buyer's name. Sold: This 2014 photo provided by e-Bay shows a rare, nearly flawless copy of Superman's comic-book debut which has sold for $3.2 million . Created by Cleveland teenagers Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, Action Comics No. 1 introduces the Man of Steel's Kryptonian backstory, earthly role as reporter Clark Kent and identity as a champion of the oppressed. It's seen as the dawn of the comic book superhero, paving the way for a roster of now-famous characters. About 100 to 150 copies are believed to exist, only a handful of them in top condition. The book just sold got a seldom-seen 9.0 on a 10-point scale used to measure vintage comic books' condition. It was kept for decades in a cedar chest in the West Virginia mountains by a man who had bought it off a newsstand, seller Darren Adams recently told The Washington Post. Adams, a Federal Way, Washington-based collectibles dealer, didn't immediately return a call Monday from The Associated Press. Origins: Action Comics No. 1 introduces the Man of Steel, who has been portrayed man times on screen. This promotional image shows Henry Cavill as Superman in the upcoming film Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice . After the original owner died, a collector bought it from his estate and built a similar cedar chest to store it, Adams told the Post. Fishler and Zurzolo own ComicConnect.com, which auctioned the 2011 record-setter and a slightly less well-preserved Action Comics No. 1 for more than $1 million in 2010. The rising prices have been fueled by superhero movies and growing interest in comic books as investments — 'an alternative place to put money that has a cool factor to it,' Fishler said. Sunday's sale also marks a high point for San Jose, California-based eBay, which Adams selected to sell an item often handled by specialty dealers and auction houses. Gene Cook, the online marketplace's general manager of emerging verticals, said the sale demonstrates 'how eBay plays a role in popular culture by connecting shoppers to must-have merchandise.' Some of the proceeds will go to the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, in recognition of the late 'Superman' movie star.Fishler said he and Zurzolo have no specific plans yet for their new-bought copy but couldn't resist it, despite the price. 'It was just too good of an opportunity to pass up,' he said.

"Jailed: William Stephens, 25, killed his 16-week-old daughter after losing his temper because he had run out of cannabis, a court heard . A father who shook to death his baby daughter because he was agitated after running out of cannabis has been jailed for six years. William Stephens, who also used heroin and crack cocaine, killed 16-week-old Paris Vince-Stephens at her home in Bristol. He violently shook his daughter after she started crying - leaving her with catastrophic head injuries and bleeding in the eyes. The 25-year-old, from Southmead, Bristol, denied manslaughter, but was convicted by a jury at Bristol Crown Court yesterday. Paris's mother Danah Vince, 19, was also accused of killing her daughter, but was acquitted of manslaughter during a seven-week trial. The court heard that on the day of Paris’s death, Stephens and Miss Vince had become 'agitated' because they had run out of drugs. Ignatious Hughes QC, mitigating, said: 'There is plenty of evidence that he and . Danah Vince are likely to have been in a state of agitation due to lack . of cannabis.' The pair had subsequently argued, before Miss Vince left Paris in Stephens's care while she went to the doctors. During her absence, Paris was . admitted to Bristol Children’s Hospital with serious head injuries - with one shocked expert saying he had never before seen such a severe case of bleeding in the eyes. The baby died three days later when . her life support machine was switched off. An examination on Paris's body found she had either been shaken or suffered a . head injury from hitting her head against a soft surface - or a . combination of both. Victim: Baby Paris Vince-Stephens was shaken to death by her father at her home in Southmead, Bristol . Stephens, who has an IQ of 52 and cannot read, initially told police he had not touched his daughter all day - claiming she had simply gone 'all floppy' while he was feeding her. However, he later admitted he 'slightly shook her' at Miss Vince's flat in Bristol. Christopher Quinlan QC, . prosecuting, said Stephens had a string of previous convictions for . violence between 2006 and 2010, including punching a pregnant woman and . assaulting a police officer. He had been handed community orders, cautions, reprimands and warnings for the offences. However, Hughes said Stephens's 'modest' upbringing in a 'drug-ridden' neighbourhood meant it was 'hardly . surprising' he had acquired previous convictions and a drug habit. Case: Stephens, who has an IQ of 52, was jailed for six years at Bristol Crown Court yesterday . He added that the defendant had been subjected to attacks in custody - including scalding . water being thrown at his face - due to the nature of . his offence in January this year. The court also heard that Stephens had a . volatile relationship with Miss Vince - with the family having been under the eye of social services. Despite being given a . restraining order to stay away from Miss Vince, Stephens had defied it and continued . living with her and their daughter. A serious case review is now being carried . out into the way public bodies handled the case. Sentencing Stephens, Mr Justice Teare told him: 'This is a case where a loss of control has resulted in a fatal act of violence on a defenceless baby. 'You will have to live with the fact that you killed your daughter.' He added that Stephens's 'serious learning disabilities' could have been a factor in Paris's death. 'You admitted having a short temper,' he told him. 'Your inability to . control your temper is exacerbated by your significant learning . disability. 'She had been left with you in her crib and she must have in some way irritated you that you lost your temper with her. 'You yourself said she was crying - it may well have been that.' Speaking after the case, . James Ward, crown advocate for the Crown Prosecution Service South West, . described the case as 'difficult'. 'Some . people may consider that six years for killing a child is inappropriate,but I want the community to understand that the defendant was charged . with manslaughter,' he said. Case: Speaking outside Bristol Crown Court, pictured, today, the CPS advocate described the case as 'difficult' 'He didn’t intend to kill the baby, nor did he intend to cause it really serious harm. 'Also, . the defendant does have serious learning difficulties. His IQ is . between 52 and 54. He lost control when he had that baby, probably . because it cried. 'As a result of that, he shook it and that baby died.' The Bristol Safeguarding Children Board has launched a serious case review, which is due to be published next year.","William Stephens, 25, shook to death his 16-week-old Paris Vince-Stephens .

"Lady Ackers wrongly claimed almost £27,000 in benefits because she 'skim read' a booklet and didn't think she would remarry, a court heard . The wealthy widow of a controversial NHS chief wrongly claimed almost £27,000 in benefits because she 'skim read' a Government booklet and didn't think she would remarry, a court heard. Former magistrate  Jayne Ackers had been receiving Widowed Parent's Allowance (WPA) from March 2008 - shortly after the death of her husband Sir James Ackers. One of the conditions was that the 56-year-old didn't live with anyone else but a court heard she began co-habiting with boyfriend James McMaster, 58, in October 2010. JPs were told Lady Ackers informed Lichfield District Council that her new partner had moved into the family's £280,000 home in Mile Oak, near Tamworth, Staffordshire, but didn't tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The nursery director claimed she wasn't aware she had to inform the Government about Mr McMaster until they were married. The court heard the couple tied the knot at glamorous Blair Castle in Scotland in 2012 but Lady Ackers mistakenly provided the information to HM Revenue and Customs instead of the DWP. During her trial at Burton Magistrates Court on Friday, the widow was shown an information booklet similar to one that would've been sent to her at the time her WPA claim began. But she told JPs: 'I was reading so much at the time that I must have skim read it. I remember reading about remarriage and thinking 'that won't be happening'.' Lady Ackers denied falsely claiming £26,980 by deliberately failing to inform the DWP she was living with Mr McMaster. And JPs took less than 10 minutes to find her not guilty - a verdict which was met by applause from the widow's family in the public gallery. Chairman of the bench Mrs Lesley Gilman said: 'Although she failed to declare information to the DWP we don't consider she did it knowingly.' The court heard Lady Ackers, who was a magistrate in the West Midlands between 1990 and 2011, met Mr McMaster in Austria in 2008 and gave him a maintenance job at her nurseries. She maintaining her innocence after being interviewed by police in December last year and JPs were told Lady Ackers has paid the money back in full. The court heard Lady Ackers and James McMaster tied the knot at glamorous Blair Castle in Scotland in 2012 but Lady Ackers  mistakenly provided the information to HM Revenue and Customs instead of the DWP . Lady Ackers informed Lichfield District Council that her new husband had moved into the family's £280,000 home in Mile Oak, near Tamworth, Staffordshire, but didn't tell the Department for Work and Pensions . Defending, Jonathan Challinor said at the time of Sir James's death, his widow had to take over his role as a director of a nursery, raise two children and make funeral arrangements. And Lady Ackers told the court: 'It was too much. I was trying to juggle all the balls.' Lady Ackers  is the director of Seesaws Day Nursery - a company which includes five nurseries, three pre and after-school clubs and two holiday clubs in Birmingham and Wolverhampton, West Mids. Businessman Sir James  died aged 72 at their home in Mile Oak, near Tamworth, in 2008 . According to their website, she said up the business with her husband Sir James Ackers in 1994 because she wanted the best care for their son Nicky who they adopted from Romania in 1990. Businessman Sir James - who was chairman of the West Midlands Regional Health Authority (RHA) for over 10 years - died aged 72 at their home in Mile Oak, near Tamworth, in 2008. The NHS chief had a rollercoaster ride at the helm of the West Midlands RHA and resigned after a string of financial scandals in January 1993. Residents in the West Midlands raised a protest petition with more than 250,000 signatures after a House of Commons motion which called for his resignation over the controversies. Die-hard Tory Sir James's career was a textbook rags to riches story and in 1961 he took over the family business Ackers Jarrett started by his dad as a garage in Walsall, West Midlands, 54 years earlier. Under his control, it flourished to become one of the largest truck-hire companies in Britain with a fleet of 1,800 vehicles until recession struck in 1991. Sir James, who was born in Walsall, called receivers to the business in August 1991 but carried on as chairman of the West Midlands RHA. He was also a national figure as a member of the NHS policy board and a personal friend of ministers including Sir Kenneth Clarke. But during the later years of his chairmanship of the West Midlands RHA, Sir James had to continually resist calls for his resignation over a string of financial claims . One of the allegations was that consultants were charging the NHS as much as £350,000 in expenses and the £4 million cost to the RHA of an efficiency study by an American firm of consultants.","Jayne Ackers had been receiving an allowance after the death of her husband Sir James Ackers in 2008 .

"George Ford booted 24 points as Bath kept the pressure on Northampton at the top of the Aviva Premiership with a 39-16 victory over rivals Gloucester. Ford was outstanding, landing six penalties and converting a penalty try and both of Matt Garvey's two touchdowns, as his side claimed their biggest-ever Premiership win at Kingsholm. Despite putting Bath under pressure at times, Gloucester could only record three penalties from scrum-half Greig Laidlaw's boot and a try from his replacement Dan Robson, which was converted by fly-half James Hook. Bath fly half George Ford fires over a penalty at Kingsholm during his side's 39-16 victory over Gloucester . Bath arrived at Kingsholm after a national newspaper report claimed that they are being investigated, along with Saracens, for breaches of the Premiership salary cap on Saturday. Nothing has been confirmed about the allegations, but it was not the ideal build-up to a big West Country derby clash for the men from the Rec. Sam Burgess, Bath's biggest signing of the season, was on the bench for the derby after starting in the centre against Montpellier in the European Challenge Cup seven days earlier. Bath replacement Matt Garvey crashes over for the first over his two tries against the Cherry and Whites . And, in front of a sell-out crowd, Gloucester were intent on adding to Bath's frustrations as they controlled the early territory but only had two Laidlaw penalties in the opening 17 minutes to show for their dominance. Bath pulled themselves together and as they hassled Gloucester in midfield, mistakes saw Ford come to the fore. The England international was in wonderful form with his clinical goal-kicking, despite an unexpected simple handling error in the first-half that had the home fans cheering. Gloucester scrum half Greig Laidlaw kicked three penalties for the struggling home side . It was intense stuff between the old rivals, with outstanding defence on both sides keeping their goal-lines unbroken. Ford and Hook tested the opposition under high balls on numerous occasions, looking for the mistake that could lead to a try, but when there was one England ace Matt Banahan was brought down close to the line after making a dart for the left corner. Gloucester had penalty attempts to get them back on terms but both Laidlaw and centre Billy Twelvetrees missed the posts, before the Scottish scrum-half finally landed a third goal when David Wilson was penalised at a set-piece. Bath winger Anthony Watson (right) is tackled by Gloucester winger Charlie Sharples . However, it was Ford who was the keystone of the half, hitting the Cherry and Whites for 15 points before the break via five penalties - most of which were from medium to long range. Gloucester started the second half on the front foot - a mirror image of the first period - as they developed countless phases inside Bath territory, but again Bath's outstanding defence was rock solid and turned the ball over to clear the danger. Ford made it six penalties when replacement loose-head prop Nick Wood took a scrum down on his own 22 and, suddenly, Gloucester were nine points down and in desperate need of a converted try. But, after replacement tight-head Sila Puafisi, who was sent off in the ugly affair between the two teams last April, was sin-binned for taking down a scrum, Bath powered their way to the line. Sam Burgess was named on the bench for the Gloucester match but saw some action at Kingsholm . Gloucester took down the maul and referee Greg Garner went under the posts to award a penalty try. Again Bath's tremendously organised defence would not be breached as Gloucester again powered within the visitor's 22. But when Garvey got Bath's second try, moments before Burgess came on in place of England wing Semesa Rokoduguni, it was all over for Gloucester. Finally, Gloucester breached the Bath line as Robson stormed in from 22 metres, with Hook converting, but it was too little too late as Garvey got a second converted try in the last move of the match.","Bath fly half George Ford kicked 24 points for his side .

"Commonwealth Games time-trial champion Alex Dowsett will attempt to break The Hour Record at the Olympic Velodrome. Dowsett's Movistar team on Friday confirmed that the 26-year-old from Essex will make his bid on February 27 during the Revolution event at the Lee Valley VeloPark, as the London 2012 velodrome is now known. The current mark of 51.852km was set by Austria's Matthias Brandle in October, but Dowsett could have to go much further as Australian pair Jack Bobridge and Rohan Dennis are to make their bids prior to the Briton. Alex Dowsett holds his Gold medial from the time trial during the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Dowsett is hoping to break The Hour Record at the Olympic Velodrome in February next year . Dowsett, a haemophilia sufferer, said at a media conference in London: 'Everyone understands a world record, so I wanted my next target to be The Hour Record. 'The Hour is something I've always been interested in; the simplicity of it, mostly: no tactics, no hiding, just you and the bike. 'Now I've got a new sense of drive as I know that the more success I can achieve, the more hope it will give everyone in the whole rare disease community. 'We spend our childhoods being told what we can't do, so I'm going for the record for anyone that gets told what they can't do something and goes out to prove themselves otherwise. Dowsett holds aloft the English flag at the medal ceremony following his Gold medal success in the summer . 'I'm training a hell of a lot harder because of it.' UCI president Brian Cookson said on movistarteam.com: 'Dowsett's attempt gives credit to the amendment of the regulations we introduced several months ago. 'The recent changes have sparked an exciting series of challenges, which is exactly what we hoped would happen when we decided to authorise the use of track bikes with modern designs and technology. 'The UCI Hour Record has been revived and is capturing the imaginations of riders and fans alike.'","The Commonwealth Games time-trial champion hopes to break The Hour Record at the Olympic Velodrome .

"Michael van Gerwen was far from his best as he survived a huge scare from Joe Cullen in the first round of his World Darts Championship defence on Thursday night. The reigning world champion was the star attraction on the opening day of the tournament at Alexandra Palace, and he averaged 96.96 and hit eight 180s on his way to victory against the world No 44. But the Dutchman was made to sweat by his 25-year-old opponent before eventually putting him away in the fourth set to claim a 3-1 victory. Michael van Gerwen won his opening match at the World Darts Championship on Thursday night . Van Gerwen is defending his world champion title at the tournament and will be in the second round next week . After his win, Van Gerwen said: ‘He (Cullen) played well and put me under pressure, but a win is a win and I’m into the next round. ‘I didn’t play very well and I wasn’t consistent enough but that’s something to work around. I hit eight 180s but I made too many mistakes. ‘When he put me under pressure, my form was there straight away and that was a good sign for me. ‘The pressure wasn’t too bad, but I think I did quite well for the first game because the most important thing in the first round of the World Championship is winning.’ Van Gerwen looked to be in his groove straight away, hitting his first 180 in the opening leg of the match to leave himself a shot at double 16 for a 10-dart leg and a break of throw. But Cullen made an emphatic statement by checking out 161 with a bulls-eye finish to take the opening leg. The opening set went all the way to a deciding fifth leg, and Van Gerwen clinched it against the throw by hitting double top. Van Gerwen pictured during his walk in to the tune of White Stripes' Seven Nation Army on Thursday . The view behind Van Gerwen as he throws one of his darts aiming for double 16 to wrap up a leg . Cullen had never been beyond the first round in his three previous visits to Alexandra Palace, but he made things very awkward for the world No 1. After three successive breaks of throw to start the second set, Cullen found himself 2-1 ahead and spurned a golden opportunity to level the scores by missing two darts for the set. Van Gerwen knew he had dodged a bullet, and stole the set in the deciding leg on his own throw. Cullen wasn’t to be disheartened, though, as he came straight back to take the third set and rattle the cage of the world champion. The Dutchman was finally woken up in the fourth set as he his five 180s and raced into a 2-0 lead, one leg away from winning the match. But back came Cullen again, this time with a 128 checkout to break back. He then had Van Gerwen even more concerned after hitting 104 in the next leg to send the set to a deciding leg. But that was as far as Cullen’s stubborn resistance stretched as Van Gerwen checked out 84 to seal his place in the second round after Christmas. Cullen but admitted that he was disappointed by the result. ‘I don’t think Michael played well at all to be honest,’ the world No 44 said. ‘We are the same age but he has got far more experience and knows what it take to win sets and matches on the big stage.’ Van Gerwen throws one of his arrows during his first round match at the Alexandra Palace on Thursday .

"Continuing our occasional series on the hotels favoured by the rich and famous, Anne Murray takes a peek at the Abama resort in Tenerife - where Penelope Cruz tops up her tan. Star quality: Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Bill Clinton, Stephen Hawking . Vital statistics: A Moorish palace of excellence in Tenerife, set high on the cliffs, the terracotta walls of the Abama shore up the Canary island's most luxurious hotels. Surrounded by extravagant tropical gardens, you'll find nearly 500 suites and rooms amid its shady courtyards. Pristine position: The Abama resort sits in a secluded spot on the west coast of reliably sunny Tenerife . Its cliff-top setting means that you'll be whisked down to the beach by a cable car, but if you want to stay put there are nine swimming pools, including an infinity pool at the cliff's edge that looks out across to the island of La Gomera. The Abama's unabashed luxury continues with two Michelin-starred restaurants. MB comes under the supervision of Martin Berasategui, with classic Spanish cuisine. Kabuki serves Japanese in a sleek red and black interior. Eight others include Le Mirador, which specialises in seafood and has views of the ocean. During school holidays, the bankers of Europe descend en masse with their young children. If you want to escape beautifully dressed eurotots, head to the Tagor villas. The most exclusive (and expensive) of all the Abama's rooms are reserved for over 18s only, with complimentary drinks and snacks. Another refuge for adults is the Abama's 72-par golf course. Considered to be one of Spain's finest, it brings golf-minded celebrities including Bill Clinton to the resort. Recharging her batteries: Penelope Cruz stayed at Abama in July with film-star husband Javier Bardem . Other sports facilities include seven tennis courts - one with seating for 600 people. Location report: Tucked away on the west coast, near Playa de San Juan resort, which is a 15- minute walk away along the cliff. The rest of the island requires a hire car. Key attraction: Privacy and the sort of luxury you would normally only find in mainland Europe or the Maldives. Reliable short-haul winter sun with Ritz-Carlton finesse (Asprey products in the bathrooms). The hotel's extensive grounds are meticulously kept, and the beach has imported sand because the local stuff was considered to be a bit dark and gritty for the hotel. In the news: Cruz and husband Bardem were at the Abama in July. Good enough for the rest of us? Technically, the Abama's beach is public - but access is almost impossible without going via the hotel. Deliberately isolated, this is a resort that would prefer you to stay close, but your pockets will have to be deep - a Coca-Cola is €5. ITC Luxury Travel (www.itcluxurytravel.co.uk, 01244 355 550) offers seven nights at the Ritz-Carlton, Abama (www.ritzcarlton.com/abama) including flights, transfers and B&B accommodation - from £1,025 per person.","Luxury five-star enclave sits on the west coast of sun-soaked Tenerife .

"Nicky Morgan said she 'probably would' vote for gay marriage if she had the chance again . The Education Secretary yesterday revealed she has changed her mind about gay marriage and now supports it. Citing her Christian faith, Nicky Morgan voted against the Government’s gay marriage law in May last year, insisting such unions should only be ‘between a man and a woman’. But yesterday, in the latest in a series of U-turns since she became Education Secretary, she claimed her vigorous opposition was partly a question of her representing her constituents’ views. And she appeared to accuse backers of the controversial law of failing to do enough to win her to their side. Mrs Morgan was promoted to the Cabinet, taking Michael Gove’s education portfolio in the July reshuffle. She was also made the minister for women and equalities. Yesterday she launched a £2million fund to help tackle homophobic bullying in schools. Promoting the move on the gay website Pink News, she praised ‘all of the great advances this country had made in securing LGBT (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender) equality’. She was heckled over her previous opposition to same-sex marriage at a Pink News awards ceremony in Westminster. As she urged the audience to ‘judge me on my record’, one critic repeatedly shouted ‘you voted against it’. Mrs Morgan had admitted her change of heart in an earlier interview on Radio 4, saying she supported ‘absolutely anyone who enters into a commitment’ and claimed she had learned ‘an awful lot’ about the issue since taking on the equalities brief. She said that at the time of the vote she had been swayed by strong opposition among her Loughborough constituents, and said she wished more supporters of gay marriage had asked her to vote a different way. At the same time, she said she had regarded the Bill as an ‘issue of conscience’. Asked if she would change her vote Mrs Morgan said: ‘I probably would. But at the end of the day, as a Member of Parliament, I’m also here to represent my constituents and, as I’ve said, I had a request by ten to one in favour of asking me to vote against it. I wish people had come forward earlier to say “Actually, we’d like you to support it”. The Education Secretary yesterday launched a £2m fund to help tackle homophobic bullying in schools . ‘I suppose for some people it was, perhaps, obvious but it was something we needed to discuss and to debate. ‘I particularly welcome the fact that 1,400 couples, probably more by now, have entered into same-sex marriages since we legislated for it in this year. ‘I do understand, of course, people who say “Well, she voted a particular way and now she’s equalities minister. We are all, as Members of Parliament, here to represent, to listen, to change minds. ‘But I had a lot of constituents who asked me to vote in a particular way and I listened to them and it was an issue of conscience too, but I have certainly learnt an awful lot doing this job.’ When the Bill came before the Commons, two Cabinet ministers and ten junior ministers joined 161 MPs in opposing it. The measure passed with a majority of 205 on a free vote. Mrs Morgan’s opposition to the Bill forced David Cameron to put another minister in charge of taking the remainder of the Government’s changes to same-sex marriages through Parliament when he promoted Mrs Morgan. She said yesterday that calling someone ‘gay’ in a hostile way was an example of homophobic bullying, which she said ‘destroys people’s education, stops them attending school and it’s something we very much want to see eradicated’. Mrs Morgan was promoted to the Cabinet, taking Michael Gove's education portfolio in the July reshuffle .","Nicky Morgan says she has changed her mind about gay marriage .

"They are calling him the Mag Slayer in Sunderland now. Scoring goals in Tyne-Wear derby victories affords you a lifetime of acclaim in these parts – do it three times and you’re talking freedom of the city. Adam Johnson – Sunderland-born and a boyhood fan – will never have to buy a drink in town again. Adam Johnson fires Sunderland into a 1-0 lead to earn all three points for Gus Poyet's side against Newcastle . Former Newcastle striker Shola Ameobi has long since been known as the Mackem Slayer. He scored seven times against the Black Cats and only Newcastle legend Jackie Milburn, with 11, has more derby goals. Johnson, though, is writing his own piece of red-and-white history. He volleyed the only goal in the last minute of Sunday’s contest to add to the pair he bagged in the 3-0 triumphs of the past two seasons on Tyneside. Johnson was also part of the team which won 2-1 at the Stadium of Light last October and only he, John O’Shea and Seb Larsson have appeared in each of the history-making four straight victories over the Magpies. Johnson (11) watches on as his powerful striker flies past the dive of Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick . So how is he enjoying his new nickname? ‘Yeah, three wins, three goals - it's great for me,’ he said. ‘I didn't know that Shola was called that to be honest. But this is a great highlight for me. ‘It's brilliant to be part of the first Sunderland team to win four in a row. We have created history. We are the team that did it. I am not sure how many more times that will happen. ‘Since I signed I have won four and drawn one. St James’ Park has been a good ground for us in recent years and for me personally it has been very good.’ The Black Cats winger wheels away in celebration of his 90th minute winner at St James Park . It wasn’t always that way. Johnson was a 13-year-old fan when Don Hutchison and Niall Quinn scored in a 2-1 victory at St James’ in 2000. By the time he was 25 they hadn’t won since. That changed when he was on target with a delightful curler from range in April, 2013 and his predatory prod 10 months later made it back-to-back wins at Gallowgate. Then, on Sunday, he started and finished the breakaway which cemented his name in the fixture’s 116-year history. ‘I was a fan in those days when we couldn’t win there,’ he said. ‘But we have started a new era of our own now and it feels great. Johnson looks towards the Newcastle fans as he is joined by his Sunderland team-mates in celebration of the goal . ‘For the goal Moussa Sissoko was having a go at me and then Paul Dummett tried to scissor me after I had turned Sissoko. But if you stay on your feet then you get rewarded and to go on from there and get the winner proves that. ‘When everybody jumped on me at the final whistle it was probably up there with the best feelings I have had in football. ‘To have scored the winner, in the last minute, in front of the Gallowgate End for Sunderland can never be taken away from me now.’ And no-one will ever try to take that away from him - rather, Adam Johnson the Mag Slayer might have to get used to his new nickname.","Sunderland beat Newcastle 1-0 at St James' Park on Sunday .

"Roberto Martinez is refusing to give up on a top-four place despite his Everton team crashing to a disappointing defeat against Southampton. An own goal from Romelu Lukaku in the first half, Graziano Pelle’s close-range strike and a goal scored by Maya Yoshida’s shoulder humiliated Everton and ended Southampton’s five-game losing streak.

That opens a real competitive edge in the top six. ‘Spurs and Arsenal are there. I still think there are a lot of points to fight for. There are a lot of teams who are going to get a lot of points from each other. ‘From our point of view it is about getting a good run of results, making sure we reach a good level of performance and we try and get into the final third of the season with an opportunity to finish as high as we can. ‘The result against Southampton is a real disappointment, don’t get me wrong, but I think we need to see through what we can achieve after that disappointment.’ Everton have struggled for consistency this season. Following their convincing win against Queens Park Rangers a week ago, after four games without a victory, a defeat so heavy to Southampton in their dire form was unexpected. Martinez is under no illusions that Chelsea and Manchester City are fighting it out for the title but he insists that a whole host of teams, including his own, are in contention for the other Champions League places.

I do think that West Ham and Southampton have had a really strong start that will mean a lot of teams will lose points against them. ‘I still think that Liverpool will have a revival and obviously teams like Spurs, Arsenal, Manchester United that they are built to win things and to finish in the Champions League that will open the league up if you can find a good run of results and form you can always sneak in. ‘That’s what we are trying to do.

"Shane Long has been surprised by people suggesting the bubble has burst at Southampton. An unparalleled talent drain in the summer led to predictions of doom and gloom around St Mary's, only for Ronald Koeman's new-look side to enjoy the club's best-ever top-flight start. Talk of a title challenge and Champions League qualification soon followed, only for the narrative to quickly change as Saints' season began to go awry. The embarrassing midweek Capital One Cup exit at Sheffield United made it five successive defeats in all competitions, so Saturday's 3-0 victory against Everton was a timely shot in the arm. Shane Long (right) of Southampton tussles for possession with Sylvain Distin (left) of Everton . Southampton's win over Everton ended a run of five straight defeats in all competitions . The comprehensive win ended Saints' worst losing streak of the 21st century in some style and Long believes highlighted the ludicrous nature of suggestions the bubble had burst at St Mary's. 'I think lots of people don't have a clue what they are talking about, saying stuff like that,' the Republic of Ireland forward said. 'I think if you'd come to watch us and seen the games, you would be happy with the performances. 'You'd be disappointed with the results, like we were, but we knew that if we kept doing the right things that things would turn our way and we'd get that rub of the green and take our chances when they come. 'That was the case against Everton. I think after the first goal, we kind of played a bit more freely and caused them a lot of problems. 'To come up with two more to see the game out and keep the clean sheet, it was a positive day all round.' Long said the players decided to 'win at all costs' against Everton after the humbling at Bramall Lane, which had repercussions far beyond dented pride. Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama were both booked against the Blades and, as a result, were suspended for the visit of Everton - absentees which saw Harrison Reed given his first Premier League start. Long praised the impact of debutant Harrison Reed (right) in the victory over Everton at St Mary's . Graziano Pelle (second left) shoots past Tim Howard to score for Southampton in the win against Everton . The 19-year-old academy graduate has been patiently waiting in the wings for his chance and certainly grabbed it, putting in a wonderful display in defensive midfield. Long was delighted for Reed, who he jokes is like the lead character of American TV show 'Ray Donovan' - a professional 'fixer' who makes people's problems disappear. 'I call him Ray Donovan because he just cleans up in midfield,' he said with a smile. 'I was delighted for him because he trains hard and I was really impressed since the first day I came in. 'He was waiting for his chance. It is hard to get a game with the quality we have in midfield, but two suspensions and Jack Cork injured as well, it has given him a chance to shine and he took it. 'I thought he was immense and did really, really well stopping the ball getting to the attack and breaking up play. It was good to watch.' As for Everton, they approach Stoke's arrival at Goodison Park with their injury problems somewhat improved. Everton manager Roberto Martinez looks on as his side are beaten by Southampton in the Premier League . The return of John Stones is one such boost, with the England international fit to start again after damaging ankle ligaments and going under the knife in October. 'I think John is ready,' manager Roberto Martinez said of the defender, who has been an unused substitute in Everton's last two matches. 'Obviously we had some players back and that is always pleasing. 'Kevin Mirallas is probably the next one and that should be in the next few days. 'It's important we get everyone back. James McCarthy and Leon Osman, we'll assess them in the next few days.

"Seb Larsson has hailed Sunderland’s fourth straight Tyne-Wear derby victory as their best yet. The Black Cats made their own piece of derby history when Adam Johnson volleyed the only goal in stoppage time on Sunday to complete a quartet of wins for the first time in 116 years of the rivalry. Larsson, along with Johnson and skipper John O’Shea, are the only players to appear in all four matches. Seb Larsson has hailed Sunderland’s fourth straight Tyne-Wear derby victory as their best yet . Adam Johnson fires Sunderland into a 1-0 lead to earn all three points for Gus Poyet's side against Newcastle . And the Sweden midfielder said: ‘It doesn't get much better than that. It tops the two performances when we won 3-0. ‘I know that might sound a bit strange but to get the winner that late is a fantastic feeling. ‘I do think we deserved it as well. We had by far the better chances but the way the last few games have gone, we haven't really scored so you get nervous towards the end. ‘But when you get such a late winner like that, the relief is something else. It was one of the better days I have had. ‘When you can give our fans something like that to enjoy just before Christmas it’s not too bad.’ Johnson (11) watches on as his powerful striker flies past the dive of Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick . The Black Cats winger wheels away in celebration of his 90th minute winner at St James Park . Sunderland were headed for a sixth goalless draw of the season until Johnson struck. Just last week manager Gus Poyet expressed his boredom with his side’s lack of cutting edge and a run of results which had seen them draw five in six. And Larsson said: ‘The way things have been going recently we have been missing a lot of chances and you get to thinking is it another one of those? ‘We were scared of conceding as well but thankfully Johnno managed to stick that chance in and we’re delighted to get the three points. ‘Hopefully this is the one game that will really kick us on and get us some wins now. ‘These derbies are amazing to be involved in but you really don't want to be on the losing end of them.’","Sunderland beat Newcastle United 1-0 in their Premier League clash .

"Stefan Johansen wants Celtic to show how good a team they are by bouncing back against Ross County on Saturday. The Scottish Premiership leaders lost the chance to increase their lead at the top of the table to seven points when they lost 2-1 to Dundee United at Tannadice on Sunday. The defeat brought an end to Celtic's eight-game winning run in the league and left them four points ahead of United and Aberdeen. Stefan Johansen (right) has urged Celtic to bounce straight back from the defeat by Dundee United . Stuart Armstong heads the ball past Celtic keeper Craig Gordon  to double Dundee United's lead . The Norwegian midfielder wants to make amends against the struggling Staggies - although he highlighted the need to take their chances. 'It was a game we wanted to win but couldn't do it,' Johansen told Celtic's official website. 'They scored two easy goals but we had enough chances to win the game so it's disappointing. 'Their early goal didn't unsettle us. We knew what they were going to do - sit back and counter-attack - and we were confident we would get our goals but it was just one of those days. 'We needed to keep a high tempo and we created some chances but didn't take them. Dundee United's Calum Butcher celebrates with teammates after his side's 2-1 victory over Celtic . 'Good teams bounce back right away so we will just focus on training well and focus on that game because we want to get back on the winning run. 'Ross County always try to defend and then counter-attack but if we do our own things well enough, then we should beat them and that's what we have to focus on.' Johansen apologised to those Hoops fans who made the trip to Tayside and hopes home advantage will make the difference against County. He said: 'The fans were fantastic at Tannadice and it was a joy to play in front of them so I'd like to say sorry that we couldn't win. 'It's a bit easier at home. It's a big pitch and you have the fans with you. Hopefully we can win.'","Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic lost 2-1 to Dundee United on Sunday .

"A Michigan man will now stand trial for multiple charges, including first-degree murder, for a home invasion, shooting and robbery occurred three years ago, after police linked him to the crime using a social media post and incremental evidence. Robert Hauser, 47, a Iosco Township landscaper who was known in the area for carrying large sums of cash, was shot to death in the basement of his secluded country home on New Years Eve 2011. Investigators allege that Anthony Sean Duke, 25, of Webberville, posted on Facebook about one month after the murder saying: 'What to do?? ... 30K I have to spend.' Although there is no conclusive evidence putting Duke at the crime scene, police believe they have now collected enough through testimony to try him. Duke has been booked with first-degree murder, home invasion and related felony firearm charges. To stand trial: Anthony Sean Duke, 25, of Webberville, has been charged with a long-unsolved Michigan murder after police collected a dossier of incremental evidence - including a social media post - against him . Livingston County District Judge Carol Sue Reader said the case was built on inferences and circumstantial evidence, including the Facebook post, The Livingston Daily reported. Part of the evidence were two bullet sabots - devices used to fire bullets that are smaller than the weapon they are being shot from - that were found at Hauser's home. A ballistic expert testified they were two halves of one sabot that was 'fired from the same barrel' of a Mossberg shotgun — the same type of rifle witnesses said Duke used for hunting practice the November before the murder, The Livingston Daily reported. Detective Mark Klein of the Livingston County Sheriff's Department said they found similar sabots at Duke's home and at the home of his father, James Duke. James Duke told police his adopted son had regularly been using his 12-gauge Mossberg and was an excellent shot. Police used the sabots to allege Hauser was in the basement of his home at the time he was shot, but that Anthony Duke was outside when he pulled the trigger. Victim: Robert Hauser, 47, a tree-clipper who lived alone on a secluded Iosco Township property, was shot dead on New Years Eve 2011 . Scene: The murder occurred here at Hauser's remote Iosco Township house. Police allege Duke shot the victim from outside while he was standing in the basement . Duke allegedly lied to police about his whereabouts on the night of the murder, saying he was with his then-girlfriend, Ashley Coselman. However Coselman told detectives Duke was not with her the entire time, and that he left for the period between 9pm and 10pm. Investigators allege Hauser was killed at 9.26pm because it was the time frozen on his watch, which they believe broke as he fell down from his wounds. Coselman also testified that, after the murder, Duke asked her to purchase a 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun on his behalf in order 'to hand it over to Livingston County Sheriff's Department'. In Duke's truck, police say they found a manual on how to beat a polygraph test. They allege they found internet searches about polygraph tests on Coselman's computer as well. Coselman also said her and Duke would argue about money, but he would come up with cash when they needed it. Remote: Hauser's home was secluded on 11000 block of Roberts Road, near Farmer John's Lane . Investigators say that while Hauser's home had not been ransacked, there was an empty zip-lock baggie found on his dryer. Friends told police that Hauser would always carry the baggie, and was known to carry as much as $5,000 cash in it. The fact it was empty suggested cash had been stolen. However Duke's defense attorney, Rolland Sizemore, said police were scrambling. 'It really looks like they're stretching to make these counts stick to Mr. Duke,' the defense attorney said. Sizemore noted the lack of evidence, and said it was not possible for Duke to shoot Hauser from outside the home on the angle police have alleged. Sizemore also said the empty baggie cannot prove anything was stolen. No new court dates have been set.","Anthony Sean Duke, 25, of Webberville, has been charged with murder of Robert Hauser, 47 .

"Derek Llambias has opened up the possibility of Kenny McDowall remaining in charge of Rangers beyond the end of the season. The new Ibrox chief executive addressed the managerial situation at Monday’s tempestuous Annual General Meeting. Ally McCoist was placed on gardening leave on Sunday evening, nine days after notifying the club hierarchy of his intent to step down at the end of a 12-month notice period. Ally McCoist left Rangers nine days after he offered his resignation to the Glasgow club . Assistant McDowall was then named as interim manager for the current campaign, with coaching support provided by Ian Durrant and Gordon Durie as Rangers seek to close the gap on runaway Championship leaders Hearts. And while the bleak financial situation continues to cloud the future at Ibrox, Llambias had words of backing for McDowall. ‘When Ally handed in his notice, it was a surprise to us,’ said Llambias. ‘He felt he had done his time and needed to move on. He was willing to work his notice. ‘We needed time to reflect on that decision and do what was best for the club. We said we’d come back to Ally and it was business as usual because we had a game at the weekend. McDowall will be in charge of Rangers until at least the end of the season . ‘We spoke to Ally last night and decided it was better that we took this opportunity to put Ally on gardening leave. It would give him time to reflect and spend time at home and for us to reorganise the coaching staff. ‘We all have to move forward. Ally has been a great ambassador for the club, he has done a great job for the club and brought through some good youth players. But it is Ally’s choice to leave, not ours. ‘When somebody makes a choice to leave in that position in football, we all have to move on. We have to respect what Ally has done and respect what the club is trying to do now. ‘We are going to give Kenny 100 per cent support. He is going to be in place until the end of the season - and maybe beyond.’ Llambias had earlier used his opening address at the meeting to outline why he believes his previous five-year stint running Newcastle United makes him the right man to drag Rangers out of their current plight. Derek Llambias has opened up the possibility of  McDowall remaining in charge of Rangers permanently . Initially appointed as a non-executive director in the wake of the board accepting a £2million loan from Mike Ashley in late October, Llambias was elevated to the post of chief executive last Friday. ‘I am honoured to have been appointed as the new chief executive of Rangers,’ he said. ‘As you can imagine, it has been a very up and down experience over the past few days – to say the least. ‘But I am now going to be in a position to roll up my sleeves and get on with the hard work it will take to get this club back onto its own two feet. ‘I have a strong track record in business and football. I spent the early part of my career in leisure before being appointed as managing director of Newcastle United. ‘When I began there in 2008 the club, quite frankly, was in a really poor state. It wasn’t easy, but with hard work they turned things round. By the time I stepped down in 2013, Newcastle United was in a financially secure position, standing on its own two feet, and it continues to remain so. McCoist and McDowall on the bench for the Scottish giants earlier this season . ‘As I begin my new period of office at Rangers Football Club, I am fully aware that this club has a great tradition and proud history. The responsibility resting on my shoulders is something I do not take lightly. ‘I know that the relationship between the board and some shareholders and fans has become strained. I understand those frustrations but that was then and this is now. ‘The task ahead will not be easy. There will be times ahead when we will have to take and make difficult decisions. Not everything I do will be popular. But I can guarantee that everything I do will be in the best interests of Rangers Football Club to secure its long-term financial stability. I only ask for your patience and an open mind. ‘This is a journey we will have to take together. The recipe for the future is simple. We need financial stability off the pitch and great football on the pitch. ‘Our goal is to get Rangers back to the Premier League and to be in Europe. That is all I can offer you now. Hopefully next year we’ll have a much better speech.’","Ally McCoist handed in his resignation on Sunday evening .

Liverpool have started the season with wins over Southampton and Tottenham sandwiching defeat at Manchester City, whilst Man Utd are still winless this season, having collected just two points so far. But Bolt remains optimistic in his hopes for his beloved Man Utd under new boss Louis van Gaal. 'I think Van Gaal means business. It will be hard adapting to his new system but over time the team will improve, as long as we have a strong back three.' 'For me, we need to be back in the top four.

"Sprinter Sacre will take a significant step towards a return to action when he takes part in a schooling session with jockey Barry Geraghty before racing at Newbury on Monday. It will be the first time the 2013 Champion Chaser has been seen on a racecourse since being pulled up in the Desert Orchid Chase at Kempton on December 27 last year suffering from a fibrillating heart. Trainer Nicky Henderson ruled out a comeback in that race earlier this month, saying it came too soon in Sprinter Sacre’s rehabilitation. Sprinter Sacre, ridden by Barry Geraghty, has not raced for nearly a year after pulling up at the Desert Orchid Steeple Chase at Kempton Park (pictured) Sprinter Sacre pulled up during the race after suffering from a fibrillating heart . But amid increasingly positive reports that the eight-year-old is showing signs of his old sparkle, it is now hoped he could be ready to race again in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot on January 17. Henderson said: ‘All being well he'll be at Newbury on Monday. I haven't worked out exactly what we're going to do yet. I'll have a word with Barry and then make a plan. ‘He won't be galloping round for two miles, but he'll have a spin out and jump a few fences and it just fits in nicely with the race at Ascot. The plan is to go to Ascot if everything goes well in the meantime. Timing-wise taking him to Newbury is perfect.’ Trainer Nicky Henderson is hopeful that Sprinter Sacre will make his return at Ascot in January .

"Sergio Aguero will make his 100th Premier League appearance for Manchester City at Southampton on Sunday with manager Manuel Pellegrini predicting that he can join Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in a three-way claim to be the world's best player. The football world is still buzzing after the Argentinian's midweek performance against Bayern Munich in which his hat-trick earned an unexpected 3-2 victory. Many pundits believe that the debate over who is the world's best player - for so long considered a two-horse race between the two Spanish-based global icons - now needs to include City's 26-year-old striker. Sergio Aguero celebrates after scoring a hat-trick against Bayern Munich in the Champions League this week . Aguero returns to training after his heroics in midweek, ahead of Sunday's trip to Southampton . Joe Hart trains, while Willy Caballero looks on, as City prepare for a crucial game against second-placed side . Aguero is mobbed by his Manchester City team-mates after another superb performance . And while Pellegrini is not ready to declare his man number one in the world just yet, the City manager firmly believes he has the potential to be precisely that. Pellegrini said: 'I said three or four weeks ago that we are always trying to demand that Sergio be a top player and be the best player in the world because he can do it. 'I hope he will continue in the same way and I am sure he is one of the top five players in the world at this moment. 'I don't want to say he is better than Messi or Cristiano but he must be very near.' Aguero has scored an astonishing 64 goals in his 99 City outings to date, a mark only bettered in Premier League history by Alan Shearer and Ruud van Nistelrooy over their opening century of matches. Manuel Pellegrini thinks Aguero can reach the level of Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and LIonel Messi (right) James Milner, Frank Lampard and Vincent Kompany go for a run during City's training session . Pellegrini added: 'It is difficult to compare the careers of very important players; Ruud van Nistelrooy has already finished his career. 'Sergio is not starting his career but he is only 26 and has a lot more years to play here. 'I always say, I am always demanding that he try to be the best player because he has all the conditions to do it. I am very glad for him that he improves every day.' It all points to a growing feeling that City are too dependent on Aguero and running the risk of losing ground should he come down with injury. Pellegrini insists that City are more than a one-man team but does concede that on current form, Aguero is irreplaceable. He said: 'Of course. I don't think anybody can replace Messi at Barcelona or Cristiano at Real Madrid or Sergio here. They are very important players. 'It is not the same playing without Aguero as it is playing with Aguero. 'But I always say we have a squad and if, for some reason, Sergio cannot play, we must have another one who can do it. Pellegrini insists his side are not a one-man team, but admits it would be more difficult without Aguero . 'We won the title last year without Sergio for a lot of games but of course when he plays, he makes a difference.'

"Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has declared 'we will sell nobody in January' as he battles to keep hold of prize asset Morgan Schneiderlin. Midfield linchpin Schneiderlin has again been linked with a move away from St Mary's, with Arsenal and Tottenham prepared to renew interest next month. The France midfielder was persuaded not to leave Southampton amid a summer exodus and new boss Koeman has since guided the south coast club to fifth in the Premier League. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has declared that the south coast club 'will sell nobody in January' Koeman has pledged Saints will not let anyone leave in next month's transfer window, while also eyeing two additions. 'We will sell nobody in January,' said Koeman ahead of Saturday's Premier League trip to Burnley. 'Morgan's attitude is fantastic - everybody knows that he had a difficult time in the summer, but finally he accepted his situation and he's doing his best and looking forward to returning to playing.' Schneiderlin will miss Saturday's Turf Moor clash as he continues to battle a groin problem, but could make a return in Tuesday's Capital One Cup match at Sheffield United. Fit-again Toby Alderweireld will ease Saints' midfield injury glut after being cleared to return for the Burnley battle, while James Ward-Prowse has almost beaten his two-month ankle problem. The Dutch boss said that Saints were looking to sign a couple of players during the transfer window . Koeman admitted losing Maya Yoshida and Sadio Mane to international tournaments in January could prompt him to dip into the transfer market. 'If everybody's available we don't need somebody,' said Koeman. 'But we will lose two players in January to different tournaments: Mane will go to the African (Nations) Cup and Yoshida will go to the Asian tournament. 'That means two players less - maybe for that we need some players, but we have to talk about that inside and make decisions. 'But I think we need one or two players.' Southampton will lose Maya Yoshida to the Asian Cup and Sadio Mane to the Africa Cup of Nations . Southampton stepped into a testing festive fixture glut sitting second in the table, only to lose three straight games to Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United. The December acid test has hit hard, but Koeman still believes his side can chase Europa League qualification. 'I think so,' said Koeman, when asked whether the Europa League was now the target. 'Okay we're always trying for the maximum, but we have to understand our situation. 'We have to be realistic, and maybe that's the target for this season. 'The way of playing is everything .We must keep believing in that, but maybe that's (the Europa League) the realistic situation for our team. French international Schneiderlin is reportedly the target of north London sides Arsenal and Tottenham . 'We can play good, attractive football, but only winning games brings confidence.' While Jack Cork remains sidelined with ankle trouble, Koeman admitted the impending return of Alderweireld, Ward-Prowse and Schneiderlin could provide a timely boost. 'James Ward-Prowse is back in training with the group,' said Koeman. 'He needs more time but he will be in the squad for the two games, because we will stay over after Saturday to prepare for the Sheffield game. 'He's one of the 22 players that will travel. 'Morgan, I don't expect him back this weekend, but he will travel with the group, because we hope he will be fit for Tuesday.

In the 22nd minute, the striker found the back of the net from close range, when he deflected a Michail Antonio cross-shot beyond keeper Silvestri - only to see his effort ruled out for offside. It looked a close decision and replays suggested that it was a wrong one, as Byram looked to have played Fryatt onside. The former Hull man was not to be denied for a second time, however, and when he forced the ball home in similar circumstances at the end of the first half, this time there was to be no intervention from the officials. This time it was a header from Michael Mancienne that Fryatt steered into the back of the net, from close range, to give the home side the lead. While Forest will have felt a sense of injustice at having a goal ruled out, Leeds will themselves have been scratching heir heads over how they had not scored.

Liam Cooper heads the ball while being slapped in the face by midfielder Lansbury . In the 14th minute, Alex Mowatt saw a driven shot, from the periphery of the box, take a massive deflection that sent it spinning inches wide of the post. Almost immediately afterwards, Mirco Antenucci's shot was brilliantly saved by Karl Darlow, who should have been beaten when the ball rebounded to Jason Pearce, just a few yards out - but the defender skied his shot wildly over the bar. Leeds did draw level after the break, as Danny Fox stuck out a leg to trip Sam Byram, with referee Roger East pointing to the spot. Sharp blasted the spot-kick down the middle. This sparked Forest into life, with the home side coming close to scoring three times. Jack Hunt shot straight at the keeper when he might have done better, Antonio forced a superb save with a driven shot and Robert Tesche sent a free header over the bar. Then came another moment of controversy, as Fryatt had another goal chalked off for a debatable offside decision, again Forest thought the goal should have stood. In the space of a few minutes Tesche, Henri Lansbury and Antonio were denied by outstanding stops from Silvestri, who was in inspired form. However, Darlow had to make a strong save of his own at the other end in the closing stages, to prevent Sharp snatching all three points for the visitors.","Nottingham Forest's Dexter Blackstock went off injured in the first half .

Mother: Amber Matuska (left and right), 31, has been accused of neglecting her son, Delmon Matuska, by exposing him to methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana during pregnancy . The medical examiner has ruled that the cause of death was 'prematurity with substance abuse by his mother as a contributing factor to his prematurity and subsequent death,' according to Tuscon News Now, . Ms Matuska has not been charged in connection to her son's death due to a legal loophole in the negligent homicide statue, which states that children born within a mother's womb could be classified as a self-abortion. The Tucson Police Department, who has been investigating the case for the past seven months, said that detectives are still trying to pinpoint when exactly baby Delmon was pronounced dead. On the day of the baby's passing, police executed a search warrant at Matuska’s home, seizing cell phones, a counterfeit $20 bill and marijuana. No charges: Ms Matuska has not been charged in connection to her son's death due to a legal loophole in the negligent homicide statue . The 31-year-old woman has an extensive criminal record dating back to at least 2003, including multiple arrests on drug charges.

"Dramatic new details have emerged of how the hero Sergeant-at-Arms dived onto the floor from behind a pillar and shot the Muslim convert who attacked the Canadian parliament. Kevin Vickers was in his office when he heard masked gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fire a flurry of bullets while running down the Hall of Honour towards the doors to the Parliamentary Library. He immediately picked up his firearm, left his office and hid behind a pillar just an 'arm's length' from where the shooter was hiding. Apparently he could see the barrel of Bibeau's gun as he stood, waiting. Scroll down for videos . Hero: Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, pictured shaking hands with Canadian prime Minister Stephen Harper, was in his office when he heard masked gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fire a flurry of bullets . Pictured receiving a standing ovation from Canadian MPs this week, he immediately picked up his firearm, left his office and hid behind a killer just an 'arm's length' after from where the shooter was hiding. His security team ran down the hall, warning him that the suspect was hiding in the alcove around the corner. Sources said after Mr Vickers knew he had killed the shooter, he calmly returned to his office to reload, in case there was any further threat. The vital actions from Mr Vickers, who has been labelled a 'hero' by his peers, all took place while the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper hid in a cupboard inside the Conservative caucus. Mr Vickers went to the door, identified himself then took the microphone at the front of the room . During the ordeal, MPs sharpened flagpoles to use as spears and barricaded the doors while Muslim convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau exchanged dozens of shots with guards inside Canada's Parliament building. He fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, as he stood guard at the War Memorial in Ottowa on Wednesday morning. Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, as he stood guard at the memorial . Politicians have now returned to the city's Parliament Hill complex, where Mr Harper said the Canadian government would 'be vigilant' to threats but 'not run scared'. 'We will always stand together,' Mr Harper said, vowing to push on with tougher security laws. 'They need to be much strengthened, and I assure you, Mr Speaker, that work which is already under way will be expedited.' Harper was in parliament when the attack began, addressing members of his party on the increased terror threat to Canada. In a televised address to the nation, he said: 'We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated. 'This week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,' 'We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and our institutions of governance are by their very nature attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.' One source told the Globe and Mail that MPs had flanked the doors of their meeting room, preparing to attack the gunman with sharpened flagpoles. 'These guys were up there holding these spears ready to impale anyone who came in,' the source said. A man identified by Royal Canadian Mounted Police as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau is seen on October 22 as he leaves a car and runs toward the parliament buildings . Cirillo is raced to an ambulance after he was fatally shot in the abdomen by a gunman as he stood guard at the National War Memorial . Ottawa police said there were shootings at the War Memorial and at the Canadian Parliament . Mr Harper was placed in a cupboard - described as little more than a 'cubbyhole' in the Centre Block after the gunfire rang out, the report said. The Globe and Mail's source said many MPs had no idea the prime minister was still in the building. Foreign Minister John Baird said there were no substantiated claims yet that Zehaf-Bibeau was associated with Islamic State. He said he was 'tremendously concerned about the number of Canadians who are radicalised and are fighting in Syria or Iraq, but we don't have any evidence to link the two at this stage'. 'Reports suggest that well in excess of 100 Canadians have gone to fight jihad in the Middle East and that's a huge concern.' Mr Baird also said Zehaf-Bibeau could have done much more damage than he did. 'For several minutes it was complete horror, complete terror, we didn't know whether the door was going to be kicked in, whether there was one or a group of people.' Canada's prime minister vowed the country would 'not be intimidated' after a Muslim convert stormed parliament and killed a soldier .","Kevin Vickers was in his office when he heard the gunman's shots .

"Builder Len Chandler feared that he was going to lose his foot after doctors told him that he had a hole in his heel. The 71 year old, from Rutherglen, Victoria had a rare form of cancer in the calcaneus, which had eaten through the heel of his foot and caused him difficulty walking. Thankfully for Len, it hadn't spread any further. 'It'd been annoying for about 6, 7 years,' he said. 'I went to so many different specialists, physiotherapists, podiatrists and acupuncturists and I was just about to give up.' Len Chandler's heel is made out of titanium which was constructed by a 3D printer . Len Chandler (pictured left) and surgeon Professor Peter Choong (pictured right) The doctor who developing techniques with 3D printing helped create a new heel for Len after he got a rare form of cancer in his foot . Melbourne-based implant manufacturer Anatomics was brought in and created a mirror-image design to help in the creation of a new heel, the CSIRO used its state-of-the-art Arcam 3D printer to build the implant from titanium . Finally, after an x-ray at a local hospital he was referred to St Vincent's Hospital surgeon Professor Peter Choong in Melbourne, who was at the time developing techniques with 3D printing. Dr Choong offered him the chance to save his foot from being amputated as most people with this type of cancer often lose the leg below the knee because it is difficult to replace the heel bone. 'I was prepared to lose it but this fantastic machine offered me the chance to save it,' he said. He then underwent a pioneering procedure using a titanium heel made in a 3D printer, what's believed to be a world first of it's kind. 'I never knew the operation would be this successful or this important,' says Mr Chandler. 'I thought it might be the first time this had been done in Victoria.' 'I didn't realise it would be the first time in the world.' 'Other poor blokes that have had this cancer have probably had their foot off,' he said. 'But I'm still going and it looks quite alright.' A team led by Prof Choong used scans of Len's left heel bone to create a 3D image of his right one. Melbourne-based implant manufacturer Anatomics was brought in and created a mirror-image design to help in the creation of a new heel. The CSIRO used its state-of-the-art Arcam 3D printer to build the implant from titanium.

The CSIRO used its state-of-the-art Arcam 3D printer to build the implant from titanium . A team led by Prof Peter Choong used scans of Len's left heel bone to create a 3D image of his right one . 'It's very exciting,' says Dr Choong. 'This is a great example of how advances in science and technology and research can be directed towards meeting a patient's needs.' Dr Choong says he's spent years dreaming about this type of procedure. 'The idea is one of those things we often fantasise about - can I make something that's exactly like the patient? Anyone in my field constantly thinks about that.' 'Then you see the technology and it clicks.' 'In this particular situation it was very helpful, because that bone that was removed was very complex in its shape and also its function.' 'So having something that replicates that made a world of difference as to what we could actually achieve.' Andrew Batty from Anatomics said the 3D heel was manufactured from titanium but at a reduced weight to work better for the doctors and the patient. 'The implant was a reduced weight by a range of techniques,' he said. 'Once we had a design prototyped out of plastic we then sent it to the CSIRO to have it machine printed, we got a rough copy back and then we processed it in our laboratory.' 'Now there's a lot of work to be done to start bringing this technology to everyone.' Len Chandler (pictured) says his foot is pretty good and he has no pain and has praised Dr Peter Choong for helping to develop his custom titanium heel on a 3D printer . After discovering he had a rare form of cancer in his foot, Len Chandler was referred to St Vincent's hospital in Melbourne (pictured) to see prof Peter Choong . CSIRO's John Barnes says these type of projects have been increasing in the last 12 months, but this particular one was the first of it's kind worldwide. Len Chandler (pictured) who had just had a new titanium heel made by a 3D printer put in reckons he'll be off the crutches by christmas . 'First time I'm aware of a custom titanium implant,' he said. 'We have the only machine in Australia and we want industry to come and use it, we want people to understand the technology.' Mr Barnes says this type of technology can benefit a number of patients suffering possible amputation and it has a quick turnover. 'We can make 15 of these ankles in one run, it's a huge benefit of technology.' 'It's like a stack of cards that has shape, there is an internal support structure and it's easier for doctors to work on.' For Len it's done wonders, who is still in awe of the operation that he had to replace his heel and it has given him a better quality of life. 'Pretty good, no pain, I'm increasing my weight (on the foot) now up to 50%, not travelling too bad,' he said. The last three weeks have made a difference, I'm confident by Christmas I can give up the sticks, the walking sticks.' Praising Dr Choong for his hard work in bringing the technology which saved his foot. 'He was outstanding, I didn't realise he was top of the range but he's not a normal person.'

Xavi replaced Guardiola on the pitch as Barca's midfield playmaker having been promoted to the first team by then coach Louis van Gaal and now he has admitted he would jump at the opportunity to coach at the Nou Camp. 'Hopefully I can (follow Guardiola) and even more so in my home here,' the 34-year-old told El Pais. Barcelona ace Xavi has revealed he has aspirations to follow former boss Pep Guardiola into coaching . The 34-year-old is starting to plan for life after football and has admitted his 'playing days are numbered' Bayern Munich coach Guardiola took over the reins at Barcelona in 2008 and won three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues in four years while making tiki-taka famous. 'My playing days are numbered, that is clear. I can feel it in my body as it is difficult for me to recover and I need to measure how much effort I am putting in,' said Xavi. 'I don't have the same sharpness to play every three days any more.' Xavi has been a key player in a golden generation for Barcelona and Spain but he says it was not easy at the start being compared to Guardiola. 'Everyone was saying I was going to be the new hero and it was tough. This made a difference to me as it meant I went out trying to be my own person while everyone else said I was the new Guardiola,' he said.

It gives us a great boost.’ Johnson (centre) celebrates in front of the Sunderland fans after the final whistle on Sunday . Poyet has now won all three derby matches as head coach of Sunderland. And the Uruguayan - who is also unbeaten in seven against opposite number Alan Pardew - hailed another special victory over their North-East rivals. ‘It's great, it's incredible,’ he said. ‘When you are on the right side, the good side, you are going to remember it all your life, so it's a special moment for us, a special moment for the club. ‘We were able to continue this winning run against Newcastle, which is great for us, without forgetting that the three points are the main thing. ‘But it makes it a very special Christmas for us.’ Sunderland were headed for a sixth goalless draw of the season before Johnson struck. Poyet – previously ‘frustrated’ and ‘bored’ by his side’s lack of cutting edge – hopes the win inspires his players heading into the festive fixtures. Johnson's goal sparked jubilant celebrations from Sunderland  and Newcastle's players were dejected . Johnson (left) shoots past Moussa Sissoko (right) and into the net to give Sunderland the victory . ‘We always talk about confidence – there is no more confidence you can get than beating your biggest rivals in the last minute,’ he said. ‘If somebody thinks differently, they have never played football, never played a derby. ‘Now next week, there are no excuses. Confidence should be high so we are able to create chances against Hull. We need to put the ball in the net. That's the good thing, no excuses.’","Adam Johnson got Sunderland's 90th minute winner against Newcastle .

"Stephen Mangongo has been relieved of his duties as Zimbabwe head coach, Zimbabwe Cricket has announced. His dismissal comes just eight weeks before the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand and ZC chairman Wilson Manase confirmed a replacement would be appointed after Christmas. Mangongo will continue to work with ZC as part of the under-19 set-up and Manase revealed there will also be a new, larger selection panel. Zimbabwe have sacked head coach Stephen Mangongo just eight weeks before the start of the World Cup . 'The ZC Board has decided to relieve S (Stephen) Mangongo of his duties as Head Coach with immediate effect,' read a Tweet quoting Manase on ZC's Twitter feed. 'Mr. Mangongo will be redeployed to the U19 set up as we believe he is good at identifying talent. 'ZC is in the process of finding a replacement coach, an announcement will be made after Christmas after interviews have been held. 'Givemore Makoni will remain as convenor of selectors, but will have a wider panel to select the team with. 'The selection panel will include D (Douglas) Hondo as assistant/bowling coach, B (Babu) Meman, the coach, and the captain.' Mangongo replaced Andy Waller in July and, while he led his country to a famous one-day international win over Australia in August, that was the only time they tasted victory under him and a recent 5-0 ODI series whitewash against Bangladesh, coupled with a 3-0 Test beating, proved to be the final straw.","Zimbabwe have sacked head coach Stephen Mangongo .

"Barcelona coach Luis Enrique says he’s not worried about the club’s transfer ban and there was an indication of why on Tuesday night as the kids beat Huesca 8-1 in the Copa del Rey. Local press lauded the performance as if it were against one of Europe's big guns and not a side from Spain’s third tier who were already 4-0 down from the first leg, but all the same 45,000 in the Nou Camp will still have taken huge encouragement from the display. Here’s Sportsmail’s lowdown on Barca’s next generation, with our prediction on their chances of making it to the first team. Barcelona youngsters (from left to right) Munir El Haddadi, Marc Bartra, Sandro Ramirez, Rafinha, Jordi Masip, Sergi Roberto, Adama Traore, Sergi Samper, Diawandou Diagne, Martin Montoya along with Pedro . Jordi Masip . Age 25 . Played in goal on Tuesday night but couldn’t keep a clean sheet and it could have been two when Juan Esnaider hit the frame of the goal with a header. Good back-up for Luis Enrique if both his goalkeepers get injured but with Claudio Bravo and Marc-Andre ter Stegen ahead of him the path to the first team looks permanently blocked. Chances of breaking through: 4 . Jordi Masip's route to the first team looks permanently blocked with two top class goalkeepers in front of him . Martin Montoya . Age 23 . Picked by Vicente del Bosque for the senior squad four years ago but has since stagnated and has not seen eye to eye with Luis Enrique this season. Got a rare start against Huesca and played well. Wants first team football but despite limited options at right back Barca don’t seem to want to give him the chance. Will leave in January. Chances of breaking through 5 (9 once he’s gone to another club) Martin Montoya will leave in January and has the quality to succeed elsewhere at right back . Sergi Samper . Age 19 . The next Sergio Busquets. Could play the position in his sleep and has already made his Champions League debut. Ran the game on Tuesday against Huesca and will crave more chances in the second half of the season. Having Busquets ahead of him makes things tough but he has the quality to succeed at the Nou Camp without question. Chances of breaking through 9 . Sergi Samper looks set to be the next Sergio Busquets - he could play the holding position in his sleep . Sergi Roberto . Age 22 . Scored and assisted on Tuesday night making the most of a rare start. There is no shortage of opportunity for him at the Nou Camp because Barca have so few options playing in his midfield position. Pep Guardiola was a big fan but he has stood still in the last couple of seasons and is no longer young enough to be able to accept playing so few games. It’s telling that when scouts come to watch Barcelona’s youngsters these days they come for Samper not Roberto. Chances of breaking through 6 . Sergi Roberto has a chance because of the postition he operates in but Samper is also highly rated . Munir El Haddadi . Age 19 . Has shot up through the ranks and looked at home in the first team at the start of the season while Barcelona were waiting for Luis Suarez to finish his ban. Frustrated not to score on Tuesday night but was instrumental in most of Barca's best football. No questioning his quality. Del Bosque has already used him to ensure he plays for Spain not Morocco (the country of his father). Only the wealth of attacking riches already in the Barcelona first team will stop him making it. Ajax wanted him on loan this season. Other clubs may ask in January but are likely to be turned down. Chances of breaking through 8 . Munir El Haddadi shot up the ranks this season and was unfortunate not to score against Huesca . Sandro . Age 19 . Most of what can be said about Munir applies to Sandro. He scored on Tuesday night in a fine second-half display and has already found the net for the first team getting the goal that saw off Villarreal earlier in the season. Is also in that queue behind Messi, Neymar, Suarez and Pedro so other clubs are watching his progress closely. Chances of breaking through 8 . Sandro Ramirez has had a similar breakthrough to Munir but could struggle for first team opportunities . Douglas . Age 24 . Made his first start at the Camp Nou on Tuesday after a £4.4m move from Sao Paolo in the summer. Looks a million miles from the level needed to be a Barcelona full back. Always chooses the safe option when in possession and lacks the ability and confidence to overlap with any purpose, even against third-tier opposition as was the case on Tuesday. Chances of breaking through 3 . Douglas looks a million miles from the level needed to be a Barcelona full-back . Adama Traore . Age 18 . In terms of raw talent it’s all there: the speed, the power, the aggression, the audacity. His goal summed up what a prospect he is. Time will tell, whether, when surrounded by better players he also has the decision-making skills to reach his potential but everyone at Barcelona is very excited. Barca's only problem is that their four best youngsters (Samper, Munir, Sandro and Adama) play in positions already well covered. Chances of breaking through 9 . Adama Traore's raw talent was obvious for everyone to see at the Nou Camp on Tuesday night .","Barcelona beat third-tier side Huesca 8-1 at the Nou Camp on Tuesday .
Sandro, Munir, Adama Traore and Sergi Samper among those to impress .
But will they rise to the top from La Masia like Lionel Messi ."
"Steve Smith hit 133 in his first match as Australia's Test captain as the Baggy Green took what could prove to be a vital 97-run lead in the first Test against India at Brisbane. The home side were bowled out for 505, with Smith leading the way, while the lower order provided much frustration for the Indian bowlers. The final five partnerships yielded 273 runs with Mitchell Johnson scoring 88, Mitchell Starc 52 and number 11 Josh Hazelwood finishing unbeaten on 32. Steve Smith scored 133 on debut as captain during Australia's first innings score of 505 all out . The stand-in skipper helped to put Australia in a string position on day three of the second Test . Smith bats during day three of the second Test between Australia and India at The Gabba . India finished the day 26 runs runs behind on 71 for one with first-innings centurion Murali Vijay the only to depart having made 28. Smith began day three unbeaten on 65 and began a sensible accumulation with India pacemen Varun Aaron and Ishant Sharma hitting their straps. The latter bowled Mitchell Marsh for 11, before a well-directed bouncer from Aaron caused Brad Haddin to glove one Cheteshwar Pujara to short leg for six leaving the home side in trouble on 257 for six. It could have been worse had a quality delivery in the 64th over from Ishant caught Smith's outside edge. The Australia captain played a magnificent innings to help put Australia in control of the Test . Smith (right) and Mitchell Johnson leave the field at the end of the first session on the third day . However he and Johnson, who has often come to Australia's rescue with the bat, rebuilt the innings. The fast bowler led the charge in his usual counter-attacking style, taking advantage of some poor bowling from Umesh Yadav bowling to smash three shots to the boundary in the 69th over. Aaron was next to get the Johnson treatment after replacing Yadav, with his first three deliveries finding the fence. Spin was not to stop Johnson, with the first delivery from Ravichandran Ashwin in the next over hammered back over the bowler's head for six. Smith brought up his century in the 73rd over, cutting a short wide delivery from Aaron to the boundary. Johnson plays an expansive shot during the third day of the second Test at The Gabba on Friday . Ishant Sharma (right) of India celebrates taking the wicket of Johnson on Friday . Smith and Johnson put on 148 for the seventh wicket before Johnson departed as Ishant slanted a delivery across the fast bowler, who top edged to MS Dhoni behind the stumps. Australia were still behind India's first innings total of 408 and there were fears that they may not move too far past it after Ishant picked up his second wicket of the 88th over, with Smith chopping on. Starc was dropped by Yadav off his own bowling when on 17 and it proved to be costly as supported by Nathan Lyon, they pushed the home side into a first-innings lead. Shikhar Dhawan of India runs between the wickets during day three of the second Test . Lyon lobbed one to mid-on off Aaron for 23, but Hazlewood picked up where he left off and it was not until Starc was bowled by Ashwin for 52, could the visiting bowlers put their feet up. It meant for an intriguing final session at The Gabba with the Australians keep to test the visitors ability to play the short ball. Vijay, who scored a glorious 144 in the first innings, showed his intentions after hitting consecutive fours off Johnson in the fifth over, but in the main it was about survival. Vijay could not quite manage that as he was bowled by Starc for 27, but both Shikhar Dhawan (27 not out) and Pujara, unbeaten on 15 saw India to the close without further damage.

"Leicester fans should show some 'loyalty' and remember just where manager Nigel Pearson has taken the club, according to West Ham boss Sam Allardyce. Pearson, whose side are three points adrift at the bottom of the Barclays Premier League table ahead of a trip to the fourth-placed Irons on Saturday, has accepted a Football Association charge of using insulting words towards a fan. The Foxes boss had refused to apologise to the supporter despite a video emerging of the incident during his side's 3-1 home defeat to Liverpool on December 2. Nigel Pearson should be given time to turn things around at Leicester, according to Sam Allardyce . Pearson's side are bottom of the Premier League having won just two league games so far this season . Allardyce - himself the subject of boos from some of the West Ham faithful last season - believes Pearson should be commended for taking the east Midlands club back up to the top flight following a decade in the wilderness, which also included a spell in League One. 'There is a turning point because what happens at football clubs, expectation grows, people think you are just going to be able to go in there and be successful from a period of great joy,' said Allardyce, who took West Ham up via the play-offs in 2012 and successfully retained their Premier League status. 'It is the fact that instead of watching your team win every week, it is a big adjustment for the fans when they find out it is not that easy any more. 'I suppose the expectation was built even higher when they beat Manchester United 5-3 and of course the Leicester fans have not remembered where Nigel has taken the club from and to in a short period of time, so they should show him a bit more patience and a bit more loyalty.' West Ham, who have lost just once in 10 matches, will see their ambitions tested with Christmas fixtures against Chelsea and Arsenal, so Allardyce knows the importance of a positive result on Saturday. 'Leicester are a hard team to break down, they work very hard for each other, despite their run of games without a win, they haven't been turned over by anyone, it's only ever by the odd goal, so there are a lot of dangers in Nigel's teams that we need to be well aware of,' he said. The Foxes have not won a Premier League match since their surprise 5-3 win against Manchester United . Midfielder Mark Noble is sidelined by an Achilles problem, but could feature next week when Allardyce will make full use of his squad. 'If we come out of this period with a few more points, then we will reassess our aims for the rest of the season,' he said. Allardyce remains 'comfortable' with the plans to talk about his contract later in the season. He said: 'I only spoke to [co-chairman] David Sullivan over some other matters in the last couple of days. Nothing to do with me or my contract. 'We will sit down when we're ready and comfortable and discuss the situation, it hasn't changed from the start of the season to now.' England Under 21 midfielder Ravel Morrison has just returned to West Ham after having his loan spell at Sky Bet Championship side Cardiff cut short. Allaryce said: 'Obviously it hasn't worked at Cardiff, so we will have to look at the situation over the new year, but my focus isn't on Ravel, it is on my first-team squad continuing the great run of form they are on at the moment.' Ravel Morrison has returned to West Ham after Cardiff City decided to terminate the midfielder's loan deal .","West Ham take on Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday .

"A $700 million foreign takeover of Wotif.com could push up the cost of accommodation across Australia. The hotels industry is concerned competition for bookings will fall when American global travel booking giant Expedia takes control of Wotif.com by the end of October. The takeover will concentrate Australia's online travel booking market into the hands of just two companies - Expedia and fellow US giant Priceline, which owns Booking.com and Agoda. Industry spokesman Bradley Woods said the two operators would now control around 85 per cent of the market, which would likely result in hotels being charged more to advertise their rooms. Mr Woods said booking websites in the USA and Europe, where Priceline and Expedia dominate, typically charge commissions of between 18 and 25 per cent, compared to Australia's commissions of around 12 per cent. 'The end effect is that Australian hotel rooms could end up more expensive as a result of this decision,' he said. But the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it would not oppose the deal. Commissioner Rod Sims said a number of smaller online travel agents have entered the market, while websites like TripAdvisor and Google Hotels Finder were allowing hotels to directly market themselves to consumers. 'The ACCC considered that the acquisition was unlikely to diminish the dynamic nature of the industry,' he said. 'Disruptive developments from smaller online travel agents and from companies in related online sectors, such as the metasearch providers, can be expected to constrain Expedia in the future.' But Mr Woods said metasearch sites do not sell hotel rooms, and so do not boost competition in the market. 'Hotels cannot compete with multi-billion dollar corporations like Expedia and Priceline,' he said. In a statement, Wotif.com welcomed the ACCC's decision and said the takeover was expected to be completed by the end of October, pending approval from shareholders and New Zealand authorities.

"With just a month to go until the 2014 Victoria's Secret Show, the lingerie brand has revealed that this year's catwalk finale will feature not one, but two ornately-designed Fantasy Bras for the first time in the show's 19-year history. Victoria's Secret veterans Alessandra Ambrosio and Adriana Lima unveiled the dazzling designs on Good Morning America earlier today, while revealing that they will be the models with the honor of modeling the unique bejeweled bras. 'This year it’s really exciting because it’s the first time that we’re going to have two Fantasy Bras on the fashion show,' 33-year-old Adriana said. Scroll down for video . Two is better than one: This is the first year that the Victoria's Secret Show will feature more than one Fantasy Bra . 'The sexiest night on television': Adriana (L) and Alessandra unveiled the bra designs on GMA earlier today and promised viewers an unforgettable show . Diamonds are forever: Each of the bras contains 16,000 rubies, diamonds and sapphires . 'I’m honored to be here with Alessandra, doing the show, walking the runway together. I cannot wait.' Alessandra,  33, added: 'We work out really hard for the show so we may as well have fun in those beautiful, amazing Dream Angel Fantasy Bras... It's going to be the sexiest night on television.' Each of the lingerie sets was made by Mouawad jewelers using 16,000 rubies, diamonds and sapphires, all of which are strung together with 18 karat gold, and took the designers more than 1,380 hours to make. But despite the ornate craftsmanship and the impressive array of precious gems incorporated into each design, this year's bras, which are valued at $2million each, are relatively cheap in comparison with previous creations. Last year, Candice Swanepoel modeled a $10million Fantasy Bra, while in 2011 Miranda Kerr wore was chosen to strut her stuff in a $2.5million set. The most expensive Fantasy Bras to date were both worn by Gisele Bündchen, who had the honor of closing the 2005 show in a $12.5million bra and the 2000 show, while wearing a $15million ruby and diamond encrusted design. Bejeweled brilliance: The bras took more than 1,380 hours to make . Dynamic duo: Both Adriana (left, wearing an Elisabetta Franchi design) and Alessandra, pictured outside Good Morning America earlier today, have had the honor of wearing the Fantasy Bra in the past . Model behavior: The girls are the first duo to be given the opportunity to close the catwalk show as a pair . That lingerie set currently holds the Guinness world record for the most expensive underwear in the world. This year's Fantasy Bra designs do mark another first for the popular underwear brand however, which revealed earlier this year that its hotly-anticipated 2014 catwalk show will be taking place in London for the first time ever. Adriana and Candice made the announcement at the brand's flagship UK store on London's Bond Street in April, with Victoria's Secret managing director Ed Razek saying: 'Candidly, we weren't well known enough here until we opened the stores. We have six stores in the UK now.' Dazzling design - and a price tag to match: Last year's Fantasy Bra, modelled by Candice Swanepoel (pictured), cost a staggering $10m . The iconic lingerie and swimwear showcase has previously taken place in the likes of Cannes and Los Angeles, and last year was hosted at the Lexington Avenue Armory in New York City. While it was previously reported that tickets to this year's show were available to buy for the staggering price of $16,000 each, the brand has since confirmed that the show is a private event and as such will not be open to members of the public, no matter what price they are willing to pay. 'Victoria’s Secret does not sell tickets to our invitation-only show and does not authorize any third-party agent to sell tickets on our behalf,' a spokesman for the brand told Fashionista.com in August. 'The only way to obtain tickets is by special invitation or through charitable contributions to pre-approved non-profit organization.'","It is the first time that the underwear brand has had two Fantasy Bras .

"Britain has an 'addiction' to sugar which is making us eat the wrong kind of apples, chef Raymond Blanc has said. The French TV cook said our love for sugar has caused a growth in popularity of sweeter-tasting Pink Lady, Jazz and Gala apples. This has led to a decline in sales for traditional fruit like the Cox apple, despite the country having perfect conditions for its growth. Scroll down for video . French chef Raymond Blanc says British apple-buyers have an 'addiction' to sugar which has led to an increase in sales of sweeter-tasting apples . Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Blanc said he was frustrated with Britain eating imported, sweeter apples when it has the 'best climate' for growing its own varieties. Mr Blanc said: 'The Jazz and the Pink Lady are not great apples. They have been engineered on sweetness, shapes, colours and resistance to disease. But mostly sugar, sugar, sugar. It’s wrong. That’s not the definition of a good food. We are addicted to sugar and the retailers know it. 'Our taste is now so neutralised that we identify taste with sweetness. Sugar is not a good taste. For any great taste, you need contradictions, a mix of sweet, sour, acid, bitter or salty. 'You have lost the taste of the apple.' The Pink Lady (left) and Gala (right) apples taste sweeter than some varieties, but this is because they have lower acidity, rather than having higher sugar content . Raymond Blanc says the Cox apple (pictured), which is seeing a decline in sales, has a 'beautiful balance of acidity, sweetness and perfume' In the last year, the sweeter-tasting Gala apples - Britain's most popular - accounted for 31 per cent of sales, with 32,237 tonnes sold. Meanwhile Cox's Orange Pippin, which is less sweet but has a less 'artificial' flavour, accounted for 21 per cent, or 21,310 tonnes. The sugar content of most apples is between 12 and 14 per cent, with a few the highest supermarket-sold apples reaching 20 per cent. Britons eat 80 per cent more red apples than green ones. It is believed that the red appearance is associated with a sweeter taste. But according to apple experts, it is not necessarily the level of sugar in an apple which makes it sweet. The Cox apple has a similar level of sugar to Gala and Pink Lady apples, but has a lower acid content. Adrian Barlow, the chief executive of English Apples and Pears, which promotes the English apple industry, said: 'The Cox balances sweetness and acidity, but the Gala is all sweetness. 'People associate appearance with taste, but that’s often not the case.' Mr Blanc, who runs the two Michelin star Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons restaurant and hotel in New Milton, Oxfordshire, is trying to grow 115 varieties of apple in his large orchard, including two types of Cox apple. He said: 'They have this beautiful balance of acidity, sweetness and perfume. And they [appear to] have less sugar. But that’s the problem: we are so addicted to sugar that we are not used to these flavours.'","Chef Blanc says Brits eat the wrong apples because of a sugar 'addiction'

"Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, today visited the poppies installation at the Tower of London - ignoring pleas from officials for people to stay away because of the problem managing large crowds. More than four million people have already visited the memorial and large crowds are a common sight.

"No government could refuse the challenge after the bloody provocations of Islamic State. But having decided by a huge majority to embark  on what David Cameron warned would be a long campaign, the House of Commons vote on Friday did not make clear what the endgame would be. Without knowing what victory will look like, have we embarked on a war we cannot win? Our model of victory is what happened at the end of the Second World War when the West successfully established democracy in defeated Germany and Japan. Scroll down for video . David Cameron says to 'forget' the last Iraq war, as things will be different this time around as no ground forces will be used, just air power to back up . local and regional allies who share our hostility to IS . But recent experience building new democracies from faction-ridden Afghanistan to disintegrating Iraq is not encouraging. The US Army thought it had kept George W. Bush’s promise to bring democracy to Iraq. But ‘winner takes all’ at the polls in countries riven by bitter religious rivalries means democracy has a sour taste for losers. Things went wrong in Iraq despite the presence of so many US and British troops and billions of dollars in aid, training and equipment. Now David Cameron tells us to ‘forget’ the last Iraq war. This time things will be different. No ground forces. Just air power to back up local and regional allies who share our hostility to IS. That all seems straightforward enough. The enemy is obvious, almost a caricature of evil. But though knowing your enemy is vital in war, knowing what your allies’ real aims are is equally important.It is our allies who frighten me almost as much as IS. On the ground, the West has friends who have daggers drawn with each other. And they have contempt for our values. Even leaving aside the oil-rich Arab despots who have signed  up for the anti-IS campaign for their own reasons, inside Nato, its key regional member, Turkey, is not fully on board. Turkey borders both Iraq and Syria and has Nato’s  second-largest armed forces after America.But precisely because Turkey is right in the thick of the Middle East, its government has a very different take on the crisis. In London and Washington, the Kurds of the region seem natural allies against the common IS enemy. Arming the Kurds to fight the jihadis seems a neat way to get local boots to do the fighting on the ground in Northern Iraq and Syria. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, seen right with U.S Vice President Joe Biden, has been a vocal critic of Israel and his open border policy to Syria has let foreign fighters, including hundreds from Britain, flow into the ranks of the jihadi forces . But to Turkey, Kurds are not natural allies. With so many Kurdish people living in Turkey itself, Ankara fears arming Kurds to fight IS today will provide them  with the weapons to fight for independence from Turkey tomorrow. Given how much expensive American weaponry fell into IS hands earlier this year as the Iraqi Army disintegrated, is Turkey unreasonable to harbour suspicions that defeat of IS by the Kurdish . Peshmerga guerrillas could be the signal  for a well-armed war for independence by its Kurds? But the Islamic-led Turkish government has been drifting away from the West in any case. President Tayyip Erdogan has been a vocal critic of Israel and his open border policy to Syria has let foreign fighters, including hundreds from Britain, flow into the ranks of the jihadi forces fighting the Assad regime, but also taking Western aid workers hostages. Syria’s civil war is key to the crisis. But there, too, Western values and the West’s allies are  in conflict. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours say they support the American-led alliance but they don’t want the victory of Western democracy in the Middle East. What we see as the best way to guarantee a future for peace and freedom, our Arab allies see as a mortal threat. The Sunni fundamentalist monarchs tolerated their rich subjects funding IS-style  jihadis to fight Assad and other allies of Shia Iran, which they hate and fear. Ankara fears arming Kurds to fight IS today will provide them with the weapons to fight for independence from Turkey tomorrow . But when upstart jihadis like the self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, began to get too big for their boots, the ruling sheikhs were happy to join in cutting him down to size. But promoting democracy, human rights, respect for women and religious minorities are not their war aims. Chaos breeds enemies like IS. It is not the solution. If anarchy is the problem, and democracy doesn’t take root easily, is dictatorship the answer? Given how unsavoury and unreliable some of our allies in the Middle East are, it is remarkable how reluctant Western leaders have been to  join up with the regimes of Syria or Iran, who have very good reasons of their own for hating and fearing IS. David Cameron, like Barack Obama, has pronounced Assad beyond the pale. So it looks like the West is undertaking a three-sided war in the Middle East, fighting Assad and his allies as well as his enemies. This may be consistent, but is it wise? If the West isn’t prepared to cooperate with the forces fighting IS in its main strongholds in Syria, then mission creep by our troops seems inevitable. A case exists for special forces operations against specific targets, like ‘high value’ IS targets or safe houses where hostages are held. But large-scale deployment of Western soldiers on the ground would be an admission of failure. This is a war which we cannot win for the locals. Maybe they can’t win it for themselves. Barring a lucky strike which knocks out the IS leadership and demoralises their supporters, air power is not going to produce rapid results. Nobody should anticipate a Victory in the Middle East Day 1945-style. The crimes of IS give us the right to fight it, but the war cannot be won by the West without local support. Tragically for us, the enemy and our dubious allies will decide the terms of victory or defeat.","Our model of victory is what happened at the end of the Second World War .

'I love maternity sessions because they show pregnancy can be sexy,' Sandi Ford tells MailOnline. 'Having been pregnant three times previously I never wanted to show my body, I felt quite unattractive and I know a lot of pregnant women share this feeling. Sometimes that ""glow"" just doesn't happen, at least not that we can see for ourselves. 'My job is to show that you can be beautiful, sensual and sexy when pregnant. There is nothing to be ashamed of and I really, really enjoy showing mothers-to be's just how gorgeous they look.

"The explosion of a nine kilogram gas bottle claimed a man's life and destroyed the lives of all other occupants as an entire unit block burnt to the ground in northern NSW. Firefighters could not save the five-unit building on Owen St in Ballina which went up in flames at about 7.30pm on Friday night - completely gutting three of the apartments.

The explosion of a nine kilogram gas bottle claimed a man's life and devastated the lives of all other occupants as an entire unit block burnt to the ground in northern NSW . Firefighters could not save the five-unit building on Owen St in Ballina which went up in flames at about 7.30pm on Friday night - completely gutting three of the apartments . Mr Karel had recently purchased the unit and only moved up the coast from Sydney about a month ago, The Northern Star reported. Resident Susannah Poole, who was watching TV in her unit on the second floor at the time of the explosion, lost everything in the fire within a matter of minutes of her lucky escape. 'I don't even have any underwear. I have nothing; everything I owned was in that place,' Ms Poole told The Northern Star. 'Just to have your whole life wiped out in one night where you don't own a single thing ... I should be grateful that I'm alive; but I am in shock.' Next door neighbour Julie Panshon, who was sitting in her back garden at the time, compared the sound to that of a bomb. 'The middle unit had just exploded - it took hold so quickly,' she said. Susannah Poole standing in front of the unit block that she once called home . Ms Poole, who cut her feet on broken glass while running down the stairs to escape the blaze, survived with only the clothes on her back, but it was the possessions she couldn't replace that were the most distressing for her. 'My parents are both deceased, and I had items that they'd given me and that hurts more than anything,' she said. She is eternally grateful for the support of her friends who are holding a fundraiser to help Ms Poole kickstart a new life. Inspector Nicole Bruce said there were no suspicious circumstances linked to the cause of the blaze, which has left the building structurally unsound, but the cause of the gas bottle igniting was not yet known. The remains of the building is expected to be demolished as asbestos is now exposed throughout the site.","A nine kilogram gas bottle exploded causing a unit block to burn down .

"An inspirational teenager diagnosed with an incurable brain tumour has vowed to raise £50,000 to help prevent others from suffering her fate. Hannah Brown, 17, was diagnosed last February. Despite having chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she was told last month that the cancer has spread to her spine and is now incurable. Since her diagnosis, family and friends say she has continued to be in high spirits - even sitting two GCSE exams - both of which she passed - in hospital the day after brain surgery. Hannah Brown, 17, was diagnosed with a brain tumour last February. Despite having chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she was told last month that the cancer has spread to her spine and is now incurable . Since her diagnosis, family and friends say she has continued to be in high spirits - even sitting two GCSE exams - both of which she passed - in hospital the day after brain surgery . And despite undergoing treatment and enduring countless operations, she has continued her studies, sporting activities and won the Prom Queen title at her school prom. Miss Brown has now embarked on a fundraising campaign for the Parents’ Association of Children with Tumours and Leukaemia (PACT) - a charity which researches the disease - and wants to raise £50,000. She said: 'I have tried to stay positive throughout. Just because I have cancer and you will see me with no hair, I am still the same person. 'I definitely don’t want to be treated any differently as I am still as positive as ever. I'll be raising money for my charity and doing things I’ve always wanted to do.' Her parents, Vel and David, added: 'She’s been through operation after operation but she’s never complained - she just gets on with it. 'When we first found the tumour was cancerous there were a lot of tears from all of us, but Hannah just said: ""Lets sort something out right now, the tears are finished, let’s just get on with it"". Hannah has vowed to raise £50,000 for the Parents' Association of Children with Tumours and Leukaemia . Hannah was diagnosed in February last year and had radiotherapy and chemotherapy but the cancer spread . 'She says ""I’m a warrior not a worrier"" - and that sums up her attitude. We are so proud of Hannah. She’s an inspiration.' Miss Brown's family are currently supporting her while gets second opinions on her diagnosis and considers treatment options. Her brothers, Matthew, 23, and 26-year-old Craig, have also been inspired by their sister. Craig said: 'Hannah is an inspiration to so many people. Throughout the last year, she has remained so strong and positive. More than anything else she wants to raise money for the charity.' Hannah said: 'I have tried to stay positive throughout. Just because I have cancer and you will see me with no hair, I am still the same person' Hannah sat two GCSEs in hospital the day after having brain surgery - and passed both of them . David Williams, principal at Ash Hill Academy in Hatfield, South Yorkshire, where Miss Brown attends, said: 'Hannah is a fantastic student who is continuing to work hard during her illness. 'She has an amazing personality and determination and this has been shown in her decision to fund raise for PACT. She is a credit to herself, her family and our academy. 'The academy is fully supportive of Hannah and her family in raising the funds for her chosen charity.' PACT was formed in 1977 as a support group for families whose children had cancer. It now provides equipment to families and provides money for research into a cure for cancer.

"Two Czech actors who dressed up as police officers in a candid camera style stunt have been given suspended jail sentences after one of the people they tried to fool collapsed with a heart attack. And ironically the man who almost died and who was left permanently disabled and in a wheelchair as a result of the prank was being filmed as part of a Czech Television charity project tackling the issues of disability. The project organisers had hired two well-known Czech actors and dressed them up as disabled policemen who flagged down motorists and told them they were being fined for speeding. One was in a wheelchair while the other used crutches, with the idea being to gauge people's reaction to being stopped for speeding by disabled policeman. Scroll down for video . Two Czech actors who dressed up as police officers in a candid camera style stunt have been given suspended jail sentences after one of the people they tried to fool collapsed with a heart attack . The prank was being filmed as part of a Czech Television charity project tackling the issues of disability . But it backfired when one of the drivers, who was not named in the trial, collapsed with a heart attack when he realised he was being filmed by Czech TV cameras in the stunt in the centre of the capital, Prague, in 2012. As a result Petr Ctvrtnicek, 50, and Jan Potmesil, 48, ended up in court charged with impersonating police officers after an investigation prompted by a complaint from the man's family. The District Court in Prague stressed that both actors were not on trial for causing harm to the man but for impersonating police officers, together with the director and the producer of the short clip, which was shown on television, although not including the part where the man collapsed with a heart attack. Trial: Actors Petr Ctvrtnicek (left) and Jan Potmesil were found guilty of impersonating police officers . However video director Tomas Svoboda and producer Jiri Kounicky were found not guilty because they did not wear police uniforms. Judge Marketa Binderova said to the pair: 'It needs to be made quite clear why you are here. Impersonating a police officer is a serious offence regardless of how good the intentions.' The actors however have pleaded not guilty and said that they thought it was obvious, given the bad quality of the uniforms, that it was just a sketch. The two actors are now considering taking legal action against Czech Television for getting them to break the law. In the latest hearing, the actors through their lawyers, claimed that they had simply 'followed the screenplay and contract as provided by Czech Television'. One of the drivers, who was not named in the trial, collapsed with a heart attack when he realised he was being filmed by Czech TV cameras . But this was rejected by the judge Binderova who said: 'Both of them are mature adults and quite capable of thinking for themselves. They must know what the law is. And they were not forced into doing this.' But outside the court Petr Ctvrtnicek rejected the judge's remarks saying: 'According to the verdict of the court it now seems that all of my acting colleagues will have to make sure they take a lawyer with them into the dressing room to avoid being prosecuted. If they don't, they could also end up with the same thing happening to them.' His fellow actor Jan Potmesil however was less combative and reserved his comments to apologise for what happened to the victim. He said: 'I am really sorry about it. I did not expect that there would be someone who wouldn't recognise us.' Potmesil is a well-known Slovak theatre and film actor, who is himself a disabled man. He became confined to a wheelchair after damaging his spine in a car accident in 1988.","Two Czech actors dressed as disabled policemen for a TV prank .

"The teenage boy who fell from a cliff in Sydney's northern beaches has woken from his five-day induced coma. Blake Hayes was climbing a rope on the side of a cliff face in Turimetta Head near Warriewood Beach when he slipped on a loose rock and fell from a 10 metre height on Monday afternoon. He turned 17 on Wednesday whilst he was in a coma. But on Friday his father revealed that his son has shown signs of improvement as he woke from sedation and was taken off a ventilator, the Daily Telegraph reports. Blake Hayes, 16, is in an induced coma after falling 10 metres from a cliff face in Sydney's north . The 16-year-old boy was attended by lifeguards from Warriewood beach and a number of onlookers following his fall at Turimetta Head . He is believed to have fallen about 10 metres as he climbed a rope up the cliff face . Blake (right) had been climbing up and down the rope with his best friend Robin Keuning (left) to access the notoriously dangerous Warriewood blowhole . 'He has movement in his arms and legs,' Jason Bowman told the Daily Telegraph. 'He gave us a smile and knows we’re there and we feel blessed. They don’t think he has any spinal cord damage.' There are high hopes that Blake, who's undergone 20 hours of surgery, will make a full recovery with his 'positive' early indications. Despite the Pittwater High School student's miraculous survive from the fall, his mother Prue Bowman told Seven News that he still had 'a lot of life-threatening injuries'. 'He's got such a long path ahead until he's anywhere near recovered,' she said. The teenager, who had been climbing up and down the rope with only his best friend Robin Keuning to access the notoriously dangerous Warriewood blowhole, was left immobile at the bottom of the cliff, waiting for paramedics to arrive. Robin, who described the heart-stopping moment he watched his friend fall to the Sydney Morning Herald, said he'd called out to Blake to ask if he was OK and received only a 'no' in response. His mother, Prue Bowman, said that despite her son surviving, he has 'a lot of life-threatening injuries' Robin, who was panicked and called the paramedics instantly after Blake fell, said he called out to ask his friend if he was OK and heard only one clear 'no' Pictured: One of the teenagers friends climbs down to the scene, desperate for an update on Blake's condition .

"The U.S. military turned over a Marine suspect in the gruesome killing of a transgender Filipino to the Philippine military's main camp in the capital Wednesday, easing a looming irritant over his custody, officials said. Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton, 19, had been detained on board the USS Peleliu at the Subic Bay Freeport, about 50 miles northwest of Manila, after he was implicated in the death of 26-year-old Jennifer Laude, whose former name was Jeffrey. Eyewitnesses say Pemberton met her in a nightclub and didn't know she was transgender until they were in a hotel room at the Celzone Lodge, according to the New York Daily News. She was later found strangled to death there, her head in a toilet bowl. Scroll down for video . U.S. marine Joseph Scott Pemberton (left), 19, is accused of strangling Filipino Jennifer Laude, 26, after finding out she was transgender. Ms Laude was found strangled to death in a hotel room with her head in a toilet bowl . Joseph Scott Pemberton is escorted to his detention as he arrives inside the compound of the Camp Aguinaldo military headquarters in suburban Quezon city, north of Manila . Pemberton's transfer by helicopter to Manila early Wednesday was agreed by the U.S. and the Philippines, Philippine military chief of staff Gen. Gregorio Pio Catapang told a news conference. He said that Pemberton will be detained in an air-conditioned van, directly guarded by U.S. Marines while Philippine military guards will be posted outside the compound, he said. 'They agreed to put him in a facility which will pass U.S. custodial standards,' Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin told The Associated Press. 'We're happy with this because he's a suspect in a crime that was committed in our country.' Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, who has described Laude's death as tragic, told The AP that the arrangement showed 'mechanisms are in place so that justice can be served,' adding there was strong cooperation between the treaty allies. A U.S. military helicopter, reportedly with  Joseph Scott Pemberton aboard, hovers above the General Headquarters of the Philippine Armed Forces . Philippine Armed Forces Chief Gen. Gregorio Pio Catapang (second from right) discusses with Eduardo Oban Jr. (right), the Director on the Presidential Commission on the Visiting Forces Agreement and other U.S. military officers after U.S. soldier PFC Joseph Scott Pemberton was flown in to his detention . Philippine and U.S. authorities engaged in a high-profile custody battle over another U.S. Marine, Daniel Smith, who was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison on charges of raping a Filipino woman after a night of drinking in 2005, also at the Subic freeport. Pemberton was transferred by helicopter to Philippine military's main camp in Manila . Smith was held at the U.S. Embassy in Manila until a Philippine appeals court overturned his conviction in 2009, allowing him to leave the country amid anti-U.S. protests. In the latest case, Philippine police and witnesses said Pemberton and Laude met at a disco bar in the city of Olongapo on Oct. 11, then went to a motel room where Laude's body was later found in the bathroom. She had apparently been drowned in the toilet bowl, according to police Chief Inspector Gil Domingo. U.S. Pacific Commander Adm. Samuel Locklear has ordered Pemberton's amphibious assault ship, which joined large-scale combat exercises with Filipino forces that ended Oct. 10, to stay in the Philippines until the investigation was completed. Under the Visiting Forces Agreement, which allows U.S. forces to conduct combat drills in the country, the Philippines can prosecute American service members, but the U.S. has custody over them 'from the commission of the offense until completion of all judicial proceedings.' The Philippine Supreme Court, however, ruled in 2009 that convicted U.S. military personnel must serve any sentence in Philippine detention. Left-wing activists and nationalist Filipinos have cited the custody provision as proof that the accord was lopsided in favor of the U.S. and undermines the sovereignty of the country, which was an American colony until 1946. U.S. Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton (center) is transported to Filipino custody . U.S. servicemen in civilian clothes carry bags of items they unloaded from a U.S. Navy helicopter as they enter the detention facility for Joseph Scott Pemberton . Left-wing groups have staged small protests at the U.S. Embassy in Manila and at the Subic wharf where the USS Peleliu is moored, demanding Washington to turn over Pemberton to Philippine authorities for prosecution and detention and calling for the 1998 agreement's abrogation. President Benigno Aquino III on Monday defended the agreement, saying a crime can happen anywhere and 'the sin of one person' should not reflect on the entire country. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that Washington seeks no special privilege for the suspect but only protection of his rights.

"Ashley Long, 14, died from after suffering an embolism from the pressurized tank depriving her brain of oxygen . The family of a teenager who died from inhaling helium at a party have said their daughter only used it because of 'peer pressure.' Ashley Long, 14, died from after suffering an embolism from the pressurized tank depriving her brain of oxygen. The craze of inhaling helium is a party trick spreading across the U.S, with users getting a comical high-pitched voice after inhalation, although it does not hold any 'high' effect. But the teen's tragic death in what her friends thought was light-heartened fun, exposes the dangers of inhaling or 'huffing' helium, especially from a pressurized tank. Ms Long had told her parents she was going to a slumber party last Saturday, but she actually went to a condo in Medford, Oregon, where police say the older sister of one of her friends was throwing a party with alcohol and marijuana. After drinking on the drive, and downing more drinks in the condo, Ashley took a turn on a tank of helium that everyone else was inhaling to make their voices sound funny. 'That helium tank got going around,' said Ashley's stepfather, Justin Earp, who learned what happened from . talking to Ashley's friends at the party. 'It . got to my daughter. My daughter didn't want to do it. It was peer . pressure. They put a mask up to her face. They said it would be OK. ""It's not gonna hurt you. It'll just make you laugh and talk funny."" Mourning: Ashley's mother Loriann Earp, center, cries with her husband, Justin Earp. They cannot believe something like helium killed their daughter . Instead, . she collapsed out and later died at a hospital, the result of an . obstruction in a blood vessel caused by inhaling helium from a . pressurized tank. Ashley's best friend Marina Zamora . said that she had never used drugs and had not drunk before and the . party was the first time she consumed alcohol. 'I think she felt I think she felt . like she was going to let us down if she didn't do it as this guys was . holding it up to her mouth, telling her to do it,' said Miss Zamora. Ashley Long had told her parents she was . going to a slumber party last Saturday, but she actually went to a condo . in Medford, Oregon, where she collapsed and never regain consciousness . She performed CPR on her best friend while others called 911, but Miss Long did not respond. Miss Zamora said the young man who pressured Miss Long left when he heard others call police. Police have arrested 27-year-old . Katherine McAloon, who lived in the condo, on charges of providing . alcohol and marijuana to minors. Devastated: Ashley's best friend Marina Zamora who performed CPR on the teen, said 'I think she felt I think she felt like she was going to let us down if she didn't do it as this guys was holding it up to her mouth, telling her to do it' Arrested: Katherine McAloon, who was the host of the party where Ashley died, faces charges from police . Justin Earp said the kids had four wine . coolers each in the car, and four mixed drinks at the condo, before . they started passing around the helium. Police . said it was an 8-gallon canister, which is availability at many stores . and the kids were taking hits directly from the tank. 'About 11.30 we got a phone call from police saying they were doing CPR on our daughter,' said Justin Earp. At the hospital, they were told that Ashley had died. Loriann Earp said she feels like her daughter was stolen from her. 'My whole chest is collapsed and my heart is broken,' she said through sobs. 'I don't understand.' She says her daughter was a goofy, nerdy eighth-grader . who struggled with her weight, was just starting to notice boys, got top . grades in school, had posters of Justin Bieber all over her room and . wanted to grow up to be a marine biologist. The family moved from Grants Pass, . Oregon, to Eagle Point about a year ago, and Ashley had just gotten over . the difficulty of adjusting to eighth grade in a new school. Dr. Mark Morocco, associate professor of emergency medicine at the Ronald . Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles, said what happens is similar to . when a scuba diver surfaces too quickly. A gas bubble gets into the . bloodstream, perhaps through some kind of tear in a blood vessel, and . can block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke. Death from inhaling helium is so rare . that the American Association Poison Control Centers lumps it in with . other gases, such as methane and propane. Only three deaths were . recorded in 2010, said spokeswoman Loreeta Canton. But police say huffing is a growing trend across the country. Officials are worried that when the tanks are on shelves with few or no limitations, choosing between proper use and abuse is at the buyer's hands. Doctors have said 'huffing' helium can have potentially catastrophic effects on the person who abuses it, cutting off oxygen in the body, essentially causing strangulation. And inhaling the pressurized air straight from the nozzle of a tank can also cause direct damage to the lung or separate it from the lining outside of the lung so it can't move normally, as well as causing a gas bubble in Ms Long's case. The gas is also commonly seen in suicide . kits - mail-order hoods sold out of Oregon and elsewhere that can be . attached to a helium tank by people who want to kill themselves. In . those cases, the helium crowds out the oxygen, asphyxiating a person. It's important to remind kids that ingesting any substance - for the sake of getting high or just changing their voices - can be dangerous, said Frank Pegueros, executive director of DARE, Drug Abuse Resistance Education. Mr Pegueros said the first defense is for parents to tell their kids about the dangers of certain substances. He said kids need to also ask themselves whether going along with the crowd at a party is worth it. 'Peer pressure is a very potent force,' he said. 'We've all gone through it growing up. It's getting somebody to pause and think and evaluate the situation and determine, is this something that's going to have a bad consequence.' Four men who were at the party have been questioned by police, but have not been charged, said Medford Police Lt Mike Budreau. More charges may be filed after police turn over their evidence to the district attorney. Her family has set up a foundation, Ashley's Hope, to spread the word about the dangers of inhaling helium.","Ashley Long told her parents she was staying at her friends, but went to a party with alcohol, marijuana and helium .

A lunch menu for the first class restaurant on board Titanic could fetch £70,000 when it goes up for sale as part of a £100,000 archive . She was also carrying a deck plan of the Titanic that helped her get to the lifeboats. The fold-up layout of Titanic was only given to first class passengers and helped them navigate the huge ship. Elise, a French maid for the wealthy Spencer family, wrote on it 'Depart le 10 Avril' and marked the paper plan with a cross to highlight where her cabin was. Hers is only one of three such plans known to be in existence and is valued at £18,000. The menu she was carrying is said to be one of kind and showed that the wealthy passengers feasted on mutton chops, roast beef, Melton Mowbray pie, lamb and mint sauce, ox tongue, tapioca pudding and greengage tart for the Friday afternoon lunch. Elise had crossed off Welsh rarebit and Omer Pacha egg as they had been taken off the menu for that day.

The inside front cover of the deck plan, which could fetch up to £18,000 at auction, is pictured right . The fold-up layout of Titanic was only given to first class passengers and helped them navigate the huge ship. It is expected to be sole for up to £18,000 . Although other menus from the Titanic have come to light before, this is believed to be the first for lunch on April 12. It is tipped to sell for £70,000. A third document that makes up the archive is a fine postcard the maid sent to her nephew from the Titanic when it stopped off at Queenstown, Ireland. Despite being used to the extravagant and opulent lifestyle of her employers, Elise wrote that the levels of luxury and comfort on the liner were 'unknown to her until this day.' The postcard, that has a picture of the liner on the front, is tipped to sell for £6,000. Elise survived the disaster and sat alongside her employer, Marie Spencer, Molly Brown, an American passenger who was depicted in the 1997 movie Titanic, and lookout Frederick Fleet, in lifeboat number six. The menu Elise Lurette was carrying is said to be one of kind and showed that the wealthy passengers feasted on the finest offerings of the day. It is dated April 12, 1912 - two days before the ship struck an iceberg - and showed what First Class guests could look forward to in the ship's luxury restaurant. Luncheon included a choice of Consomme Paysanne (a form of vegitable soup) along with pea soup, fillets of whiting, Haricot Ox Tail and boiled chicken and bacon with parsley sauce. It also included Omer Pacha Egg (poached eggs covered in sauce) and Welsh rarebit - but both these items were taken off the menu that day. In a section called 'From the Grill' diners were offered grilled mutton chops with potatoes cooked three-ways - mashed, straw (fried) and baked. The menu,  dated April 12, 1912, shows what First Class guests could look forward to in the ship's luxury restaurant. Pictured is Cafe Parisien - an extension to the First Class restaurant . It includes tapioca pudding, greengage tart and pastries. From the buffet, passengers had a choice of mayonnaise of salmon, soused herrings (herring soaked in a mild preserving liquid), potted shrimps or plain and smoked sardines. Options include roast beef, spiced beef, Melton Mowbray pie, lamb with mint sauce, Virginia and Cumberland ham and Bologna sausage. Items also include brawn, corned ox tongue as well as lettuce, beetroot and tomatoes. The cheese selection included Cheshire, Stilton, Gorgonzola, Edam, Camembert, Roquefort and St Ivel (a British brand of cheeses and dairy products). To wash it down, guests were offered iced draught Munich Lager. She kept hold of the documents and passed them on to her family who are now selling them for the first time. Andrew Aldridge, of Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire, is selling the three items. He said: 'This is a quite remarkable archive of Titanic-related documents that has never come to public attention before as it has been in the family of Elise Lurette all this time. 'As far as we are aware the lunch menu is the only one for April 12 that is still in existence. 'There are a few for dinner on April 14 - the night of the disaster - but that is understandable as they would have been in the pockets of coats and dinner jackets of survivors. 'On the night of the sinking, after a member of the ships' crew knocked on Elise's cabin she put a coat on over her nightdress. 'In that coat were the menu and deck plan which would have helped her find her way to the top deck where the lifeboats were being lowered. 'You can understand her having the plan on her to get to safety as quickly as possible but it is just pure luck that Elise Lurette still had the lunch menu from two days before. 'The deck plan folds up to 10ins by 3ins and is long and thin. It was her map for getting around the huge ship and would have been invaluable to her as she spoke little English. A postcard sent by Elise Lurette to her nephew from the Titanic - when it stopped off at Queenstown, Ireland - is also up for sale and could fetch £6,000 . Despite being used to the extravagant lifestyle of her employers, Elise wrote that the levels of luxury and comfort on the liner were 'unknown to her until this day'. The postcard could sell for £6,000 . 'She marked an X next to her cabin, stateroom B76 and wrote 'Depart le 10 Avril' on the front cover together with the figures '787.50' and '1197.50', possibly the cost of the cabins that Elise and the Spencer family booked. 'Postcards written onboard Titanic aren't rare but this one gives us an interesting snapshot of the levels of luxury on it. 'This is a woman who worked for an extremely wealthy couple who owned their own castle on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland, yet she states in her card that she has never seen such splendour up until stepping on board Titanic.' Elise was aged 59 at the time of the disaster and died the next year. Her employer, William Spencer, perished in the sinking. He was not the only multi-millionaire to die on Titanic. Isador Strauss, John Astor and Benjamin Guggenheim were unable to get a place on the lifeboats despite their wealth.

"Jean Ahmed, who claimed that her partner, with whom she had four children was her landlord to claim over £120,000 in benefits . A mother-of-four has been jailed after claiming her partner was her landlord as part of a £120,000 benefits scam. Jean Ahmed, of South Shields admitted falsely pretending to be a single parent in order to claim benefits she was not entitled to. Newcastle Crown Court heard that the 43-year-old's partner owned the house where she lived and secret surveillance proved they were living together as a couple. For 12 years between 2001 and 2013 she was paid income support, job seekers allowance as well as housing and council tax benefits amounting to a total of £123,201, which she was not entitled to. The court was told that when she was confronted by investigators she said: 'I knew this day would come.' Today Ahmed, a student at Sunderland University admitted four charges of benefit fraud and Mr Recorder Euan Duff then sentenced her to 15 months in prison. He told her: 'The benefits system benefits those in need, who deserve money and who depend upon it. 'It is harmed by people of your sort who dishonestly take huge amounts from the public purse.' But the judge said he accepted Ahmed was sorry for what she had done and that she has 'many positive sides' to her character. Prosecutor Tony Cornberg told the court investigations based on banking documents and finance forms showed Ahmed's partner was living with her at the house, as well as being the owner of it. Mr Cornberg said: 'He owned the house and she was the tenant. 'Surveillance was conducted between August 2012 and April 2013 at the address. 'Her partner was leaving and returning regularly. 'When interviewed she confirmed the two were in a relationship and had four children together. 'She summed up in a statement saying she knew this day would come.' At Newcastle Crown Court, pictured, Ahmed admitted four charges of benefit fraud and was sentenced to 15 months in prison . Vic Laffey, defending, said Ahmed had 'glowing' references from people who knew her and has done a huge amount of work for her community, including . involvement in an arts project for people with learning difficulties and a play group for disabled children. Mr Laffey said: 'She has accepted this day was coming and she has lived with . the dread of it for a long time. 'She is concerned for her children above all else. It takes precedence over . concern for her own welfare, without a shadow of a doubt.'","Jean Ahmed said her partner was her landlord so she could claim benefits .

"The 'Supermarket Jihadi' who left Britain to become a fighter in Syria is now a policeman for Islamic State, cracking down on such 'crimes' as smoking or listening to music. Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, who was a former security guard for Morrisons, said on social media that he is now a member of the hisbah, the IS all-male police force. The fanatic, who this month appeared in an IS video online in which he calls David Cameron a 'despicable swine', lives in Raqqa, where he arrests residents on the street or in their houses.

Militant: Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, who was a former security guard for Morrisons, said on social media that he is now a member of the hisbah, the IS all-male police force . Last week, Hussain posted a picture on Facebook of cartons of cigarettes, which he boasted he had seized from a house. Smoking or playing music is punishable with up to 30 lashes in IS-controlled areas of Iraq and Syria. The news comes as Islamic State militants publicly crucified and murdered a teenager they accused of taking photographs of the terror group's headquarters in Syria. Sickening images purportedly taken in the central square of the extremists' de facto capital Raqqa show the battered and bloodstained body of an unnamed 17-year-old boy strapped to a cross. A handwritten placard hangs around the teenager's neck, accusing him of 'apostasy' - the abandonment of his religion - and says he had been crucified for three days after being caught receiving 500 Turkish lira for every photograph he took of an Islamic State military base.

"Stem cells can be used to heal the damage in the brain caused by Parkinson's disease, according to scientists in Sweden. They said their study on rats heralded a 'huge breakthrough' towards developing effective treatments. There is no cure for the disease, but medication and brain stimulation can alleviate symptoms. Parkinson's UK said there were many questions still to be answered before human trials could proceed. Scientists have found stem cells can heal the damage to the brain caused by Parkinson's disease. The actor Billy Connolly (pictured) was revealed last year he has been diagnosed with the condition . Researchers said their study on rats using stem cells (pictured) heralded a 'huge breakthrough' towards developing effective treatments for the condition . The disease is caused by the loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce the chemical dopamine, which helps to control mood and movement. Comedian Billy Connolly revealed last year he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s. The Scottish actor, 71, was diagnosed by a doctor in a hotel lobby, who spotted that his gait suggested he was showing early signs of the illness. In the new study, to simulate Parkinson's, Lund University researchers killed dopamine-producing neurons on one side of the rats' brains. They then converted human embryonic stem cells into neurons that produced dopamine. These were injected into the rats' brains, and the researchers found evidence that the damage was reversed. There have been no human clinical trials of stem-cell-derived neurons, but the researchers said they could be ready for testing by 2017. Malin Parmar, associate professor of developmental and regenerative neurobiology, said: 'It's a huge breakthrough in the field [and] a stepping stone towards clinical trials.' A similar method has been tried in a limited number of patients. It involved taking brain tissue from multiple aborted foetuses to heal the brain. Clinical trials were abandoned after mixed results, but about a third of the patients had foetal brain cells that functioned for 25 years. Using embryonic stem cells may be preferable, as it is easier to get hold of the large numbers of cells needed for transplant by growing them in the laboratory. But Parkinson's UK has said there are still questions that must be answered before human trials can proceed. The disease is caused by the loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce the chemical dopamine, which helps to control mood and movement . It also opens up the possibility of using less ethically charged sources of stem cells, such as those made from adult tissue. The charity Parkinson's UK said the research 'could be a stride towards clinical trials in people with Parkinson's'. Its director of research and development, Arthur Roach, said: 'This important research is a key step along the way in helping us to understand how stem cells might shape future Parkinson's treatments. 'There are important potential advantages of these cells over the foetal-derived cells used in past cell transplantation work. 'This study could be a stride towards clinical trials in people with Parkinson's but there are still many questions that need to be answered before this development can be tested in people with the condition.'","Scientists at Sweden's Lund University have hailed study a 'breakthrough'

"A family is in mourning after a wife and mother-of-two Mary Jordan died on a family holiday in New Zealand. Mary Jordan and her husband Trent were four days into their holiday in Rotorua with their children Cara, 6, and Harry, 9. Mr Jordan and his son were exploring a nearby national park, leaving Mrs Jordan and the couple's daughter at their accommodation. Mrs Jordan suffered a seizure in a hotel swimming pool, as Cara struggled to hold her mother's head above water, drying her with a towel before running for help. Trent Jordan and his wife Mary, who suffered a seizure while on holiday in New Zealand and passed away . Trent and Mary Jordan with their children Harry, 9, and Cara, 6, who tried to revive her mother . 'We meshed, lived, laughed and loved in the way that now she’s gone, I’m not sure who I am,' said Mr Jordan . Mary Jordan's father-in-law posted this message on his Facebook after her death . Paramedics were called to the scene but were unable to revive Mrs Jordan, who had a history of seizures and have suffered eclampsia during at least one of her pregnancies. Cara is now being hailed for her courage, with New Zealand police praising the six-year-old girl for her brave actions. Mr Jordan spoke out at his wife's funeral, saying that 'told me how brave you were and how much love you showed to Mummy by keeping her safe and going for help,' 'I am so proud of you and so is everyone else here. You’re a hero.' At the farewell service for Mary Jordan last week, Mr Jordan called his wife 'my best friend, my love, my life', reported the Courier Mail. 'The cliche is that there’s a hole in my heart,' he said. 'It’s not so simple. We were one. One word – ‘trentandmary’, lower case, no spaces. Take out a single letter and things get confused. Take away the last four letters and the meaning vanishes.' Trent and Mary Jordan on their wedding day. They celebrated 15 years of marriage recently . 'The cliche is that there’s a hole in my heart,' Mr Trent said. Mr Jordan said he wanted 'to tell the world how wonderful she was'. 'We meshed, lived, laughed and loved in the way that now she’s gone, I’m not sure who I am.' The couple lost a daughter, Ellen, to Neonatal Hemochromatosis, just a day after she was born, with Mary suffering seizures as a result of complications following the birth. She was placed in a drug-induced coma which lasted for four days. The Jordans had campaigned to raise awareness of the condition, explaining on their blog, 'We hope that sharing our story of Ellen will help people who may have experienced a similar loss.' Mrs Jordan wrote of her experience of the ordeal saying, 'We also know how fickle life can be'. Trent Jordan said that the couple had recently celebrated 15 years of marriage and both of their 40th birthdays. 'That night was a wonderful opportunity for me to explain and tell everyone what a wonderful and beautiful person my wife was,' Mr Jordan said. 'I didn’t do it ... I didn’t worry too much, though. I wouldn’t forget next time. But this is next time. She’s not here to hear me say it.' Mr Jordan said he wanted 'to tell the world how wonderful she was'.

"The Navy SEAL who claims he shot and killed Osama Bin Laden says the terror leader died afraid at his compound in Pakistan. Robert O'Neill, who was unmasked this week by MailOnline as 'The Shooter', said: 'He (Bin Laden] died afraid, and he knew we were there to kill him. And that's closure.' O'Neill  opened up about his meeting with the relatives of the 9/11 terror attacks saying: '[O]ne thing I tell them is all right, Osama bin Laden died like a p****.That's all I'm telling you. Just so you know.' Scroll down for video . What's done is done: Bin Laden shooter Robert O'Neill (above) said: 'He (Bin Laden] died afraid, and he knew we were there to kill him. And that's closure' Under fire: This comes as many are attacking O'Neill for making his identity as a Navy SEAL public . This was all revealed in a series of recorded interviews O'Neill had with journalist Alex Quade that were aired on Friday's AC360. He added that it doesn't matter who ultimately took down the terrorist. 'The most important thing that I've learned in the last two years is to me it doesn't matter anymore if I am The Shooter,' O'Neill said. 'Regardless of the negativity that comes with it, I don't give a f***. We got him.' He also revealed in these interviews that he and his fellow SEALs did not think they would make it out alive after raiding bin Laden's hideout. 'Well, you have to go pump yourself up to go die. So we would talk about this,' O'Neill said of their acknowledgement that this would likely be the end for them. '(It was a) group of guys who knew time on Earth was up, so you could be honest with each other. And we all accepted and nobody was afraid. It was really cool.' Down: O'Neill says of what happened, that anyone who questions him can only ask one other person what really happened, Osama bin Laden (above), and he's dead . Site: O'Neill also revealed that he and his fellow Navy SEALs did not think they would return alive after the raid on bin Laden's hideout (above) O'Neill's move to go public has been met with mixed response, and heavily criticzed among his fellow SEALs. He sees it differently however, pointing out how films like Captain Phillips and Zero Dark Thirty both made his work very public, and that high ranking officials have no spoken openly about both incidents. 'Once anyone says anything at that level, it's not classified,' he said. 'I was told by people that I can't even say I'm a Navy SEAL, so I don't give a f*** what they think.' Public guy: O'Neill seems fine with his detractors these days in interviews, saying he doesn't care if people think he is 'full of s***' As for those who question him, he is not letting it bother him. 'Even now, I mean, there are guys now saying that I am full of s***,' he said. 'You only know what you were told unless you were in the room. And unfortunately for me, there was two people in the room, and one of us is dead and that's Osama bin Laden.' O'Neill is due to appear in a two-part documentary on Fox News next week, detailing his part in the killing of bin Laden. MailOnline exclusive disclosed his identity this week ahead of the broadcast. O’Neill has already described the night of May 2, 2011 in an interview with Sharon Stone’s ex-husband Phil Bronstein that appeared in Esquire magazine in February 2013. But his name was not revealed at that time and he was referred to only as ‘the Shooter.’ Now his identity has become public, military leaders and fellow SEALs are lining up to discredit his version of events. Donation: O'Neill gave his SEAL team uniform the museum at the memorial to the September 11 terror attacks in New York after meeting relatives of the victims of bin Laden's atrocity. It was then that he decided to tell the wider public that he was 'The Shooter' Speaking success: O'Neill is now a high-profile member of the motivational speaking circuit, openly revealing that he was a SEAL - but until now not declaring that he was involved in the daring raid which killed bin Laden . A former SEAL Team 6 commander told the New York Times O’Neill only fired ‘insurance shots’ into bin Laden’s twitching body after the terror leader had already been mortally shot by an unidentified SEAL who is still in the service. That hero is described as the ’point man’ who led the SEALs up the stairs in bin Laden’s compound to the bedroom where he was hiding. Another Team 6 member also disputed O’Neill’s version, saying the 'point man' had wounded bin Laden with a shot to the side, and then grabbed the women in the room for fear they were wearing explosives. O’Neill, he said, had then finished Osama off. And Reuters quoted an unidentified source close to a SEAL Team 6 member as saying the fatal shot was fired by one of two other men who entered the room before O'Neill. But O’Neill told Bronstein last year: ‘I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! same place. That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath.’ One SEAL source told MailOnline: 'The real shooter would never discuss it publicly. 'Members of SEAL Team Six haven’t discussed it publicly so there’s a reasonable chance he’s not being truthful. 'There is no way O’Neill could really prove it was he who took the fatal shot on Osama bin Laden unless his comrades all attested to it. 'But again, the code of secrecy with these special operators would preclude that.'","Robert O'Neill was unmasked this week by MailOnline as 'The Shooter'

"When young British models Cara Delevingne and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley stepped out at Paris Fashion Week wearing V-neck tops slashed to their waists this week, onlookers might have expected an abundance of breast on show. After all, the new trend for deep-plunge necklines leaves little to the imagination. But there was, in fact, barely any cleavage to be seen — despite the minimal material. For this slick new style, spearheaded by the slimmest of celebrities, is actually all about having no cleavage. It is, indeed, the ‘no-cleavage cleavage’: a daring display of chest that demonstrates not acres of soft, ample bosom but a hard, toned torso without a whiff of wobble. Scroll down for video . Rosie Huntington-Whiteley: It's hard to upstage a strip sequin jumpsuit, bur Rosie's gravity-defying body puts this Balmain creation in the shadows. But then, this plunge is designed to do one thing: show off a taut, perfect torso. Gwyneth Paltrow: Gwyneth manages a laid-back take on the tux by pairing relaxed trousers with her plunging neckline. The result is effortlessly chic, though the chunky gold chain emphasises her jutting collarbone. Abbey Clancy: Grown-up rather than gimmicky, she channels the no-cleavage cleavage look in a classic white suit. Perhaps it is the fear of flashing, or lavish amounts of sticky tape under the jacket, which leaves her looking uncomfortable. Cara Delevingne: Dramatically plunging is an understatement — this top is smaller than most swimming costumes. Coupled with stripy, see-through trousers and a waist-squeezing belt, her Balmain jumpsuit screams ‘look at my chest!’ Kate Hudson: Kate's beautifully draped frock is a red carpet winner, complete with regal train and shimmering fabric, but it’s the plunge neck that steals the show, and the toned skin and body it reveals. Georgia May Jagger: Proof that no-cleavage cleavage can be classy. Georgia’s sophisticated Thierry Mugler dress flashes large amounts of flesh but strikes a balance between chic and sexy. Sienna Miller: Sienna's low-cut lace dress with waterfall hem needs only one accessory — a golden tan. Oh, and perfectly toned, svelte side order of toupee tape to keep it all in place. Reese Witherspoon: Reese's trademark prom dress gets a modern makeover with this slashed-to-the-navel version. It’s further highlighted by a split-patterned long skirt which ensures the right flash of flesh is on show - her chest. Miranda Kerr: The Australian model is more shapely than many — but this outfit is calculated to play down her curves. Seen at this week’s Louis Vuitton show, her only accessory is the gold chain of her Vuitton bag. Kate Moss: An original member of the ‘flat pack’, supermodel Kate has long shown bigger isn't always better — and by pairing this super-low neckline with batwing sleeves, her kaftan-inspired dress is respectable rather than racy. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini: Cheryl plunging neckline shows that even with more womanly curves, you can still nail the no-cleavage cleavage look. Bold, blue and brave — Cheryl goes all-out with this daring jumpsuit carefully tailored to highlight her upper body. Suki Waterhouse: This plunging neckline highlights not just a toned chest but also more of her pale, interesting look. Where most V-neck dresses are designed to highlight a cleavage, this version, worn with no bra, does the opposite. Minnie Driver: Minnie's scooped neckline shows off not her cleavage — cleverly supported as it appears — but her collarbone and swathes of soft, supple skin. The figure- hugging, long dress only further highlights the effective look. Stella Tennant: Masculine tailoring and muted colours would make British model and Queen of Androgyny Stella Tennant’s outfit a masterclass in understatement if her shirt wasn't worn quite so open to reveal acres of bare flesh. A curvy chest has long been a sought-after asset — driving women to try everything from push-up bras and gel pads to breast-boosting surgery, with designers delighting in showing off a generous bosom with corset tops and scoop necklines. But it’s naturally associated with a more curvaceous figure — and if there’s one thing today’s celebrities don’t want, it’s to be anything other than pin thin. So far from being shy about showing off a flat-chest, bony Gwyneth Paltrow deliberately opts for a daringly low V-neck black trouser suit, while of-the-moment supermodel Suki Waterhouse makes the most of her total absence of cleavage in a deep-cut black dress. Cara and Rosie’s bold jumpsuits go one step further, with nothing but narrow, bandage-like straps that would struggle to hold in most women’s modesty and a skin-tight halterneck style that actively flattens what little bosom they have. After decades of women enhancing their cleavage, these clothes go flat out to obliterate any hint of a curve. Never mind that such an androgynous chest would look more normal on a teenage boy than an average adult woman (typical size, a voluptuous 36C and rising) — what better way for stars to flaunt their taut, trim body than by showing off a bare, flat front? The style also demonstrates their enviable ability to go bra-less; if most ladies’ breasts might sag and escape without support, these stars show not so much as a crease. The subtext is clear: not for them the oh-so-common battle to contain troublesome lumps and bumps, their bodies are so neat and pert they require no assistance at all. Except, of course, that such a style is not quite as carefree as it looks; hidden under these well-positioned outfits will be plenty of carefully placed tape to keep the fabric attached to the skin, as well as secret modifications, from nipple stickers to strapless cups to ensure a smooth, safe appearance. Here we look at how the stars are turning to dramatically low-cut attire to show off their no-cleavage cleavage . . .","In the past women have gone to great lengths to enhance their cleavage .

"They appeared to have been given a taste of the high life that most of us can only dream about. But when X Factor fans saw this year's hopefuls travelling first class during trips to Bermuda, Mexico and Los Angeles for the Judges' Houses stage of the competition, all was not as it seemed. According to one source connected to the ITV talent show, the young singers only enjoyed a fleeting moment in the coveted British Airways cabins. X Factor fans saw this year's hopefuls travelling first class on British Airways flights during trips to Bermuda, Mexico and Los Angeles for the Judges' Houses stage of the competition . Despite being seen toasting each other with champagne in the luxury surroundings as they jetted off, the young singers were then said to have been sent back to their economy-class seats as soon as filming had finished. An insider told The Daily Mirror: 'The singers were summoned from the rather less salubrious confines of economy to sit in the first class seats and told to make out they were having a lovely time for the cameras. 'Champagne bottles were popped and they were all told to laugh and joke around as if they were having the time of their lives. 'But no sooner had they settled in and sipped some of the champers, they were told to get back to their seats in economy once filming duties were complete.' According to one source connected to the ITV talent show, the young singers, including duo Blonde Electra (pictured), only enjoyed a fleeting moment in the coveted BA cabins before being asked to return to economy . A spokesman for the X Factor declined to comment of the allegations. The episodes, which were shown earlier this month, showed Simon Cowell and his fellow judges including Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Mel B and Louis Walsh, picking the 16 finalists to appear in the show's live finals. Simon Cowell and his sidekick Sinnita flew to Los Angeles, while Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and rapper Tinie Tempah filmed in the south of France, and Louis Walsh was joined by former judge Tulisa in Bermuda as the judges were tasked with choosing their favourite three acts to compete in the live finals of the programme. An X Factor inside claimed: 'Champagne bottles were popped and they were all told to laugh and joke around as if they were having the time of their lives' The finalists have since moved in a £2.8m mansion with a gym and pool in the north London suburb of Enfield. The mansion is furnished in French antique style with lots of cream carpets throughout and huge beds. The news comes after an earlier controversy when it was reported last week that the X Factor wannabes had caused chaos on-board a BA flight back to Gatwick, following their performances at Mel B's house in Mexico. According to fellow passengers, they enjoyed so many of the free drinks during the flight that airline staff had to close the bar. The male contestants, who were travelling from Cancun after performing at the Spice Girl's pad, allegedly made so much noise on the night flight, stewards were forced to get involved. Simon Cowell flew to his home in Los Angeles for the Judges' Houses round of the X Factor . It is claimed that passengers were left disgruntled by the rowdy antics and the men 'knocking back drinks like they were going out of fashion'. The six contestants had been banned from drinking during the six days they spent at Mel B's house - where they performed in front of the Spice Girl and sidekick Emma Bunton. However, passengers said the singers made up for it on board the British Airways flight – a claim that representatives for the X Factor and British Airways have strenuously denied. Last month it was revealed that last-minute breaks to Las Vegas has soared by 100 per cent after it was suggested that Simon Cowell would host the Judges' Houses round of the competition here. Former Spice Girl Mel B jetted of to Cancun in Mexico, where she was joined by ex-bandmate Emma Bunton . Louis Walsh chose Bermuda as the location for his Judges' House on this year's series of the X Factor . Sin City was leaked as the music mogul's chosen base weeks before the episode was screened and actually filmed at his home in Los Angeles. As a result, Lowcostholidays said they had seen a sharp increase in holiday bookings, although the other Judges' Houses hotspots didn't fare so well. While Cheryl Fernandez-Versini chose her new husband's country of origin as a destination to train up her protegees, it seems she hasn't inspired many viewers. While Las Vegas saw a 100 per cent increase in bookings in the days following the leak, Nice has seen no increase at all. In contrast, the Mel B effect has given holidays in Cancun, on Mexico's Caribbean coast, a 10 per cent boost. But Bermuda has only seen a single digit increase since it was revealed as Louis Walsh's destination of choice.","Wannabes told to 'make out they were having a lovely time for the cameras'

"Maybe the government should start thinking about bringing back the baby bonus after figures have revealed that the birth rate in Australia has continued to fall. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has found that the country's birth rate has reached its lowest point since 2006. But the good news is for older mums, who are bucking the trend, with fertility rates increasing for those aged 40-44 years between 2012 and 2013. Australia's birth rates continue to fall and it has reached the lowest point since 2006 . The fall in births, along with an increase in the number of women aged 15 to 49 years - contributed to Australia's total fertility rate falling from in 2013 but older mothers bucked the trend with fertility rates increasing in those aged 40-44 .

'But the trend among older mothers - those aged between 40 and 44 years - was reversed, and their fertility rate has continued to increase since its lowest point in the mid-1970s.' 'Over the past 30 years, fertility rates for these older mums have nearly tripled, and today's results see the trend continuing', said Ms Carlton. Breaking it down by gender, the number of baby girls born in Australia in 2013 was down more than 1,200 compared to 2012. But the number of baby boys didn't differ too much from the previous year, only 282 births down in 2013. There was a total of 308,100 births in 2013, which is down on the 309,600 from the previous year (1,517 less babies born) Despite a fall in the birth rate, aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander woman actually recorded 73 more births in 2013 than 2012 although their fertility rate decreased . The national average for the media age of mothers increased only slightly from 30.7 in 2012 to 30.8 in 2013 . Across the states, New South Wales had the most number of babies born at more than 100,000, followed by Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia.

"BBC Children in Need has kept £87.7million stashed away in its investment portfolio instead of giving it directly to charity, its latest accounts reveal. The charity, which has raised more than £600million for youngsters in the UK since 1980, is preparing to launch a fresh appeal to viewers next month. But some donors may be surprised to discover it does not give the money directly to good causes. Scroll down for video . Charity accounts reveal £87.7million invested in portfolios which the BBC will be handed out once they assess the impacts of other projects (pictured, charity mascot Pudsey and show host Terry Wogan) Children in Need has £87,705,000 invested in a range of portfolios, up from £81.2million last year. Another £2.2million is sitting in its bank accounts, up from £864,000 last year. The accounts reveal it paid £9,000 in fees to fund managers and made £893,000 in investment income. Its latest charity drive will include a series of celebrity-endorsed fundraising campaigns, and with the profits of a recently released BBC recording of the Beach Boys track God Only Knows, is expected to raise more than £20million. The money is used to help charities that support disadvantaged and disabled children around the country. Yesterday, the BBC insisted all of the money it raises is given to charity, but said it does not release all of it at once so it is able to measure the impact of its donations and ensure funds are being put to good use. A spokesman said: ‘This money is not simply cash. It has been allocated to projects working with disadvantaged children and young people throughout the UK. ‘In line with standard grant-making practice we do not typically release the full grant upon successful application from projects but rather over a three-year period on a quarterly basis so we can monitor projects to ensure that they continue to comply to the terms and conditions of the grant.’ In 2008 the BBC faced the prospect of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office after keeping more than £100,000 which should have been given to charity. The BBC is about to launch a fundraising drive, with sales of Beach Boys track God Only Knows set to raise £20million (pictured, One Direction, Pharrell, Kylie Minogue and Chris Martin who feature on new single) The broadcaster admitted staff knowingly withheld money meant for causes including Children in Need and Comic Relief. The scandal emerged after auditors carried out an investigation into the BBC’s phone-voting systems. The cash was generated by callers voting after phone lines had closed on about 20 shows, believed to include Eurovision and Fame Academy, between October 2005 and September 2007. They were still charged for their calls, typically around 25p a time, but the cash went into the bank account of BBC Worldwide, the corporation’s commercial arm, rather than the charities. An internal audit showed that a number of workers in Audiocall, part of BBC Worldwide, repeatedly kept money back. It has now been passed on, with interest. The BBC has said the ‘small number’ of staff involved face disciplinary action. In 2006 TV viewers were warned against giving money to the BBC’s Children in Need appeal. An independent watchdog said donating to the charity is ‘a bad idea’ because of its huge administration costs – £2.4million out of a total of £33million raised at the time. Intelligent Giving said money is swallowed up by the need for two sets of bureaucrats: those who run the charity and those in charge of the organisations to which it gives money.","Charity also has £2.2million in its accounts up from £900,000 last year .

"An alcoholic drink can be as fattening as a doughnut – but most consumers have no idea about the calorie overload, campaigners warn. Pressure is growing for drink companies to be compelled to label alcohol bottles with the number of calories in a bid to tackle obesity. A Krispy Kreme original glazed doughnut contains up to 190 calories – around the same as a large glass of wine or pint of lager. More than three-quarters of the public did not know or wrongly guessed the calories in a large glass of wine . Even a standard 175ml glass of wine – containing between 126 and 160 calories – can be as fattening as a Cadbury’s Hero miniature or a slice of rich Madeira cake. But more than three-quarters of the public did not know or wrongly guessed the calories in a large glass of wine, a survey found. Nine out of ten had no idea what a pint of lager contained. Tests showed those given more information drank 400 fewer calories by choosing different forms of alcohol, the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) said. Its poll found two in three adults want to see calorie labels on alcohol. It is calling on the drinks industry and the EU health commissioner to introduce calorie labelling for alcoholic drinks – currently not classed as food – because irresponsible drinking is fuelling an obesity epidemic. The move was backed by campaigners Alcohol Concern but drinks producers said the new laws could take years to pass and voluntary action by the industry was the way ahead. An alcoholic drink can be as fattening as a doughnut but most people have no idea about the calorie overload . RSPH chief executive Shirley Cramer said: ‘There is a clear public appetite for this information. With two in three adults overweight or obese, and given that adults who drink get approximately 10 per cent of their calories from alcohol, this could make a major difference to waistlines of the nation.’ Calories in wine vary with colour and sugar content; a small 125ml glass of dry white has about 85 calories, sparkling 90 calories, sweet white 120 and red 120. The RSPH has urged the labelling change to be brought in throughout the EU and called for more research into the relationship between drinking and weight. Its poll of 2,117 British adults found most either did not know or underestimated the calories in a glass of wine and a pint of lager. Alison Tedstone, of Public Health England, said: ‘Alcohol is almost as calorific as fat, which people don’t realise. If you think, if you have a couple of glasses of wine with a meal that’s like having an extra course.’ Alcohol Concern chief executive Jackie Ballard said: ‘You walk into any shop and the calorie, fat content, sugar and more are on the back of food packets and we don’t see why alcohol should be any different.’ But The Portman Group, which represents alcohol producers, said a decision on labelling would rest with the EU and could take years. A spokesman said: ‘The industry takes all health-related issues regarding alcohol very seriously and actively promotes and funds Drinkaware, which provides calorie information through apps and on its website. ‘Drinks producers are open to discussions about calorie information. However, it is essential that alcohol content, not calories, should primarily inform consumer decision-making.’ ■ Stronger wines should be taxed more heavily than those containing less alcohol, the public health minister said. Jane Ellison told MPs she wants to vary the duty on bottles of wine – with the hope of pushing drinkers towards buying lower-strength wines. Tax on beer is varied on this basis. Stephanie Lis, of the Institute of Economic Affairs, criticised the plan, saying: ‘Wine is already enormously over-taxed.’","Pressure on drink companies to label alcohol bottles with the number of calories in a bid to tackle obesity .

"Splashing a large amount of cash on a flashy engagement ring may seem like a great way to show your partner you care - but it could doom the marriage from the start. Researchers have discovered that people who spend large amounts on engagement rings and/or their weddings, increase their chances of getting a divorce. And spending less than $1,000 (£620) on an engagement ring increased the chances that the marriage would last. Scroll down for video . Researchers have discovered that people who spend large amounts on engagement rings, and, or, their weddings, increase their chances of getting a divorce. Spending less than $1,000 (£620) on an engagement ring (stock image) increased the chances that the marriage will last . Economics professors from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, surveyed 3,000 adults who had been married at some point during their lives. They discovered that participants who spent between $2,000 (£1,250) and $4,000 (£2,500) on an engagement ring were 1.3 times more likely to get divorced. The ideal cost of an engagement ring is between $500 (£310) and $1,000 (£620) because spending any less than this is also linked to higher divorce rates. Furthermore, the economists found that weddings that cost in excess of $20,000 (£12,445) were 3.5 times more likely to end in divorce, compared to couples who spent between $5,000 (£3,111) and $10,000 (£6,223) on their big day. The economists found that lavish weddings costing in excess of $20,000 (£12,445) were 3.5 times more likely to end in divorce, compared to couples who spent between $5,000 (£3,111) and $10,000 (£6,223) on their big day. Stock image pictured . Engagement ring: The study found that spending between $2,000 (£1,250) and $4,000 (£2,500) on an engagement ring increases the chance of divorce by 1.3 times. The ideal cost of an engagement ring is between $500 (£310) and $1,000 (£620) because spending any less than this is also linked to higher divorce rates. Women with engagement rings over $2,000 (£1,250) were three times as likely to complain of stress caused by wedding-related debt. The big day: Weddings costing in excess of $20,000 (£12,445) were 3.5 times more likely to end in divorce. The average cost of a wedding in the UK and US is now around $30,000 (£18,668). Debt: A 2013 survey by insurance firm Sheila's Wheels revealed that 12 per cent of British couples have more than £3,000 of debt to pay as the result of splashing out on their big day. It found that one in eight newlywed couples have sold wedding gifts to try and recoup costs and over half of them think wedding costs are out of control. This may be bad news for many couples, because according to figures by The Knot, the average wedding costs $30,000 (£18,668) in the US and almost exactly the same amount in the UK. A recent survey by insurance firm Sheila's Wheels found that one in eight newlywed couples are selling wedding gifts to pay for their nuptials, and more than half of couples think wedding costs have spiralled out of control. The economists believe that the link between expensive rings and wedding days, and divorce rates, may be down to the financial stress put upon bride and grooms. The new study found that women with engagement rings over $2,000 (£1,250) were three times as likely to complain of stress caused by wedding-related debt as those with smaller rocks. In contrast, those who spent less than $1,000 (£620) were up to 93 per cent less likely to be stressed out by the cost of their wedding. The economists wrote in the paper: ‘Our findings provide little evidence to support the validity of the wedding industry’s general message that connects expensive weddings with positive marital outcomes.’ They did however find that big weddings are best if done on a shoestring. Having more guests at a wedding increases the chance of a long marriage, they concluded. The economists believe that the link between expensive rings and wedding days, with divorce rates, may be down to the financial stress put upon bride and grooms.

"A British marketing rep who was sacked by the Jamaican Tourist Board after an outburst on Facebook about her father's brutal murder on the Caribbean island has won her case for unfair dismissal. Zoe Bennett, 35, from Preston, Lancashire, made the comments after she discovered that Errol Bennett, 59, had bled to death after being attacked by machete-wielding intruders while on holiday. Weeks later, she was suspended due to 'comments on Facebook', which she says the board thought were 'detrimental to Jamaica'. She was finally dismissed by the board in December 2013. But Ms Bennett has now been awarded £19,000 in compensation from the Jamaican Tourist Board, after a hearing ruled it had been wrong to sack her. Zoe Bennett, 35, left, from Preston, Lancashire, has been awarded £19,000 from the Jamaican Tourist Board after being sacked for outbursts on Facebook when she discovered her father Errol, right, had been murdered . Speaking after her victory at the hearing in London, Zoe claimed it had been a 'personal vendetta'. The mother-of-three said: 'I'm delighted to win the case because I can now put it behind me and concentrate on getting justice for my dad. 'It was ludicrous right from the word go. I still can't believe what I did was seen as misconduct. I suppose they felt what I said was detrimental to Jamaica. 'The last few years have been terrible. My dad died in horrific circumstances, and then I've had all these problems at work, which I believe were actually a personal vendetta against me. 'I worked for the company for eight years and dedicated so much to them. All my hard years of work just feel like they've been wasted. I've been plagued by this for so long, I want to move forward now.' Ms Bennett had posted three separate messages on the social media site, one of which was on the day she found out her father had been killed. Retired Errol Snr, also from Preston, was attacked on December 17 while on a winter break at his villa in the parish of Hector's River on the east coast of Jamaica. The former upholsterer, who moved to Britain from Jamaica in 1967, suffered 15 separate injuries – including deep wounds to his head and torso. Errol Snr (centre), pictured with her brother Errol Jnr (left) and Ms Bennett (right) was attacked on December 17 while on a winter break at his villa in the parish of Hector's River on the east coast of Jamaica . After his death, Ms Bennett posted three separate messages on Facebook, one of which was written on the day she found out about her father and promised to 'avenge' his death . Ms Bennett, pictured here with her brother and father, was sacked from her position when she returned from Jamaica after identifying her father's body . In that post, Ms Bennett pledged to 'avenge' his death and said: 'The b******* have murdered my dad in Jamaica. My heartbeat, my life has gone.' In a second post, Ms Bennett criticised the Jamaican police for being 'slow in their uptake' on the investigation. She said: 'All I want is justice. But the police are slow on the uptake even though they have a witness statement.' And in the third she announced she was flying out to Jamaica even though her own life had been threatened, saying 'The b******* can try and kill me too – but f*** them. I will have my eyes open'. The single mother departed for Jamaica the next day, while on her scheduled Christmas holidays, to identify her father's body. The mother-of-three, pictured at her father's grave, said she is glad the tribunal is over so she can focus of getting justice for her father . But in a phone call to her regional director at the Jamaican Tourism Board on December 19, she was told that officials had seen the Facebook comments and she would be spoken to about them on her return. Then, on January 5, she received a letter from the tourist board telling her that she had been suspended due to 'comments on Facebook' and that it had launched an investigation. The board, which is based in the Jamaican High Commission in London, asked her to attend a disciplinary meeting on January 13, two days after her father's funeral in Preston. Ms Bennett, who worked for the company for eight years, believe she was sacked due to a 'personal vendetta' She had been told the disciplinary investigation will also cover 'breaches of confidence' after her suspension was reported in a local newspaper. Today, Ms Bennett told how the company cancelled her suspension in February 2012, but that she remained on sick leave until her maternity leave started on April 1 of that year. On April 1, 2013 she was due back to work. But when she requested phased return to work, Ms Bennett claims this request was never answered. She launched a grievance claim against the company, which was combined with the existing disciplinary hearing for her Facebook comments. On December 16, 2013 she was fired. She appealed in January 2014 but the appeal was refused. She attended a three-day Employment Tribunal hearing in London on September 29 where she was finally vindicated. She won claims of unfair dismissal and wrongful dismissal against the Tourist Board. Ms Bennett, who has three children - Charnai, 18, Aliyah, four, and two-year-old Krystal - said: 'I won a £19,000 payout from the Tourist Board. 'The figure was actually higher but I negotiated to take a lower payment if they agreed never to appeal the decision. 'I think that's the biggest relief for me because it's been hanging over me for so long that I didn't want to have to be scared it would rear its head again.' Speaking shortly after she was suspended, Zoe's brother Errol Jnr, had said: 'She has been devastated by this - what the Jamaican Tourist Board have done is disgusting. 'She has had so much to think about - but the Jamaican Tourist Board only seem interested in protecting the reputation of the country.' Her cousin Clifton Bennett, 33, was arrested nine months after the killing and, after several adjournments, is due to stand trial on November 25.

"Two great white sharks spotted off the coast of Chatham, Massachusetts, on Tuesday are regulars in the region according to the expert who tagged them. ‘They’re here every year,’ Greg Skomal works with the state Division of Marine Fisheries told The Boston Globe. ‘We’ve been [tagging them] since 2009.’ The Cape Cod area was famously used as the setting for the Jaws movies, which feature a gigantic man-eating great white shark. According to a post on the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy’s Facebook page, they spotted at least 10 other sharks on Tuesday . The sharks are most frequently found on the east-facing beaches of Cape Cod, rather than the calm beaches of the popular Nantucket Sound . However there is no imminent danger for holidaymakers. The sharks are most frequently found on the east-facing beaches, rather than the calm beaches of the popular Nantucket Sound. The two white sharks represent the ninth and tenth great whites to be tagged by the marine fisheries division off the Massachusetts coast in 2014. The animals are tagged to study their migratory habits. It is thought that one of the main reasons the animal is drawn to the Cape Cod area is because nearby Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge has a huge population of seals, which are a favorite food of the great white shark. They were photographed by Wayne Davis, a spotter pilot with the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy. One of the main reasons the sharks are drawn to the Cape Cod area is because nearby Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge has a huge population of the blubbery seals - a favorite food of the great white shark . The last human death blamed on a great white shark in Massachusetts was in 1936 with only four ever documented in the area . According to a post on the Conservancy’s Facebook page, the team spotted  at least 10 other sharks on Tuesday. The sharks can grow to 20 feet in length and weigh up to 5,000 pounds. They have rows of renewable razor sharp teeth, which make them a formidable predator.
