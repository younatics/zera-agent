"By . Mark Duell . A dead dog has been found hanging from a metal chain on a residential street just yards from a primary school after suffering a ‘slow and painful death’. The RSPCA today released the disturbing image of the lifeless Staffordshire Bull Terrier Bull Mastiff cross in a bid to catch the thugs who left him in Dudley, West Midlands. A passer-by found the dog dangling 15ft from metal railings early Saturday morning - and the scene was so horrendous that he told the RSPCA he thought the lifeless dog had been nailed to the wall. Horrifying: The RSPCA today released the disturbing image of the lifeless Staffordshire Bull Terrier Bull Mastiff cross in a bid to catch the thugs who left him in Dudley, West Midlands . Both police and the RSPCA - which described it as 'one of the most shocking crimes we have seen in many years' - were called to Bishop Close, near Kates Hill Primary School, where the dog was found. Disturbing pictures show the dog hanging against a brick wall by a chain fixed to metal railings above. He had no other signs of abuse or neglect and police believe he may have been a pet. RSCPA Inspector Dave McCartney said: ‘This was a deliberate act. Whoever has done this has lowered the dog over the fence and pulled the chain up and fixed it to the railings above. ‘We won’t know all of the physical details about this dog’s death until after the post-mortem results come in. But there is no doubt in my own mind that this dog would have suffered. 'We want to find the owner, but we also really need to find whoever was responsible for killing this dog in such an horrific way.’ Scene: The wall and railings on Bishops Close in Dudley, where the dog was found hanged on Saturday . Labour MP for Dudley North Ian Austin . said: ‘Decent people will be appalled by such a horrendous crime. It is . utterly barbaric and you have to question the mentality of the people . responsible. ‘Someone must . know who did this and I hope they come forward with any information . they have so the police and RSPCA can bring the perpetrators to . justice.’ 'Decent people will be appalled by such a horrendous crime. It is utterly barbaric and you have to question the mentality of the people responsible' Ian Austin, Labour MP for Dudley North . And Deputy Mayor . of Dudley Steve Waltho said: ‘I am an animal lover myself. I can't think . what goes through people's minds to do such a barbaric act as this. ‘I . was numb when I heard and I am appalled by it. If you're displeased . with an animal then shoo it off but to physically and callously strangle . a dog? I can't imagine what these people were thinking.’ Meanwhile, . the leader of Dudley Conservative Group, Councillor Patrick Harley, . added: ‘I hope if they find the person who did this that the same . punishment could be administered to them. ‘As . an owner of two Staffordshire bull terriers I'd be first in the queue . to give them a taste of their own medicine. They are absolutely low life . and don't deserve to be breathing the same air as the rest of us.’ Location: Both police and the RSPCA were called to Bishop Close (pictured), near Kates Hill Primary School. The school is to the right of this photograph . An RSPCA spokesman added: ‘There was no signs of any obvious neglect or abuse. The dog was actually in a good physical condition, apart from the obvious, suggesting it may have been a family pet. 'This was a deliberate act. Whoever has done this has lowered the dog over the fence and pulled the chain up and fixed it to the railings above' Dave McCartney, RSCPA Inspector . ‘It had been given a proper diet and had obviously been cared for at some point. It did not deserve to suffer such a slow and painful death. ‘It is obviously a horrendous crime and one of the most shocking we have seen in many years. We just urge anyone who might know anything to get in touch.’ The dog was said to have been aged between one and two and was not micro-chipped. Anyone with any potential details about the dog’s owner or culprit is urged to call the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018.","RSPCA searches for thugs who left dog dangling from railings in Dudley .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . A growing number of families are moving their elderly parents in with them as overcrowding, house prices and care costs soar, official figures suggest. Millions of Brits are now living in homes with at least five other people amid a shortage of housing as the population booms, the Office for National Statistics has found. In total the number of people living in households with six or more occupants has surged by 25 per cent in the last 10 years - with more than three million people now live in a homes with at least five others. England's population is booming - with every region set to grow between 2012 and 2022 . Experts at the ONS said the surge was due to 'economic or cultural factors' - including young couples living with parents because they cannot afford a home. But older couples living with their adult children - the new 'sandwich generation' of Brits - has also soared as elderly care costs force couples to look after their aged parents and their children at the same time. The growth in crowded homes will also include immigrant workers in more expensive areas of the country such as London. Every region of England and Wales, apart from the north east, saw a rise in the the proportion of households with six or more occupants over the 10 year period. In Newham, East London, 10 per cent of properties are home to six or more people. Outside the capital, Luton, Slough, Bradford, Birmingham and Leicester were the areas with the highest proportion of 'six or more'. The unprecedented strain on housing supply was laid bare last night by figures showing the country’s booming population. England will have to find room for 3.8million extra people over the next eight years at a time when house prices and rents are already spiralling. In the most overcrowded part of the country, Southern England, more than 2.5 million more people will be crammed in by 2022, according to the breakdown from the Office for National Statistics. This will require an estimated million new homes to be built in the already overcrowded South. The increase will also bring new pressure on transport, education, health, water and energy services. The Midlands and the North will have to find homes and services for 1.3million, the report said. Immigration is the major driving . force behind the population increase, and is now having a bearing on . housing across the southern half of England. The report will make grim reading at a time when home ownership has become unaffordable for many families. House prices are rising faster than at any time since 2007. A shortage of homes means the value . of a typical property in England and Wales has risen 6.1 per cent in a . year, to £161,900. In London, prices have risen by 17 per cent. Yesterday David Cameron praised the . Government’s Help to Buy Scheme for assisting 7,313 property purchases . in its first few months, the vast majority outside the capital. The Prime Minister said: ‘As Britons, . home ownership is in our blood – it’s about aspiration, planning for . the future and laying  down roots.’ England's population is expected to boom in the next decade - with London, the South East and parts of the East Midlands (coloured in dark purple) set to grow more quickly than elsewhere . Despite a booming population and growing demand for homes the number of people living in each household has plummeted over the last 100 years . The housing crisis is being made more acute by the growing number of homes being left empty. The Office for National Statistics revealed today that more than a million homes are now unoccupied . But the number of people helped by the scheme pales in comparison to the millions who will require homes in the next decade. Since 2000, the number of families, couples and individuals needing homes in England and Wales has gone up by 1.7million. This figure is far ahead of the rate at which new homes are being built. According to the ONS, the population . will rise by a million in London alone by 2022, with another 1.5million . adding to the squeeze in the rest of the southern half of the country. It will mean intensifying demand for . homes at a time when property prices are booming and millions are . struggling to get on the housing ladder. The ONS population estimates were . released following a week of deep controversy over the political and . economic impact of immigration, with Ukip scoring successes in local and . European elections. It is driving about two thirds of . Britain’s population increase and is believed to be directly responsible . for more than a third of the demand for new homes. The new breakdown analyses where the 3.8million more people expected to be living in England by 2022 will settle. It suggests that the population of . London will go up by 13 per cent to just under 9.4 million over the . decade from 2012 to 2022, while there will be increases of 8.6 per cent . in the East, 7.8 per cent in the South East, and 6.9 per cent in the . South West. Soaring house prices have pushed more and more people into rented accommodation, the Office for National Statistics has found. Almost one in five homes is now rented out . As more than a million homes lie empty, people are squeezing themselves into properties. The number of homes with six or more people in them has soared by 25 per cent in 10 years . However population pressure will also . affect the northern half of England. There will be a 3.6 per cent rise . by 2022 in the North West and 2.9 per cent in the North East, adding . some 350,000 to the numbers living across both regions. Although London’s population is . rising overall, thousands of families are fleeing the capital in search . of better schools, transport and lifestyles, and lower crime. Their arrival is further pushing up demand for housing and services, on top of the impact of immigration. Rural and suburban areas are also . feeling the impact of the Whitehall push for new housing on a large . scale on green  field sites. Residents are invariably anxious to keep these as  pristine countryside. Government housebuilding planners say . at least 200,000 homes a year are needed. A third of these are . necessary to meet the demands of immigration. But last year, despite a . 28 per cent increase, fewer than 135,000 were built. Sir Andrew Green of the MigrationWatch think tank said: ‘This is the chickens coming home to roost. ‘The effects of mass immigration are . being clearly seen in housing.The chattering classes are still in . denial, ignoring the fact that immigration accounts for over a third of . new household formation.’ Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont today hit back at Labour claims that immigration was good for the economy. He said it was obvious that the size of the economy would grow if there were more people in the country - but that did not mean people would be better off as a result. The Conservative peer said 'most of any benefit goes to immigrants themselves'. Writing in the Times, he wrote: 'In judging the pros and cons of immigration what matters is not as they argue GDP but GDP per head. 'Immigration may enlarge the economy by having more people but that does not benefit the existing population unless it increases living standards per head.' His remarks came after Lord Hutton and Alan Milburn, the former Labour cabinet ministers, urged the Government not to crack down on immigration. Lord Lamont said: 'Immigrants between 1995 and 2011 cost the Exchequer £95 billion. 'Hutton and Milburn argue that migrants are a “bulwark against an ageing population”, but as our report pointed out immigrants also grow old and trying to deal with that phenomenon through yet further immigration would require ever escalating levels of immigration.' He added: 'What cannot be denied is the massive impact of immigration on the size of our population. If we allow it to continue at the average of the past ten years we will add ten million to the UK population in the next 20 years with at least 60 per cent of the increase due to immigration.'Lord Lamont said 'practically nobody wants to see this'. The Tory peer said dismissing 'genuine and justified concerns' was 'simply to play into the hands of extremists'. He added: 'It is not a more stringent immigration policy which would have “serious consequences for the wellbeing of our economy and society”, as they claim. 'On the contrary, it is failure to respond to the clear and consistent wishes of three quarters of our population that would indeed have such consequences.'","England's population set to grow by more than four million in 10 years .

"By . Becky Barrow . and Damien Gayle . Homeowners should brace themselves for sharp increases in the cost of their mortgages, the Bank of England warned yesterday. It is a bitter blow for Britain’s 11.2million mortgage holders and comes as a direct result of the chaos in the eurozone. The crisis is driving up the cost of borrowing for high street lenders in this country – and they aim to ‘restore’ their profit margins by passing on that cost. Homeowners should brace themselves for sharp increases in the cost of their mortgages, the Bank of England warned yesterday . Experts fear higher rates will mean many homeowners will have to find thousands of pounds extra a year, and some will be pushed ‘over the edge’. The warning comes on a bleak day for the economy, which is stuck in a double-dip recession as policymakers and politicians try to insulate it from Europe’s chaos. The Bank said the eurozone crisis is beginning to hit homeowners, many of whom are already struggling to find the money to make their monthly repayments. Since the start of the year, the funding costs for the high street banks have soared – and they are passing on the pain to their customers, including homeowners and savers. The Bank’s report warned: ‘In the absence of falls in funding costs, it suggests that some further increase in mortgage rates is likely as banks seek to restore their margins.’ Some of the biggest mortgage lenders, such as Halifax, the Co-op and Yorkshire Bank, have already hit their customers with an increase in their ‘standard variable rate’ loans. This is the type of loan which homeowners are automatically moved on to when their current deal, such as a two-year fixed loan or a three-year tracker, comes to an end. Experts have for weeks been advising SVR mortgage holders with equity in their property to scramble to get back onto a fixed rate while deals are still available. Tiffany Clayton, 23, a personal assistant, and her boyfriend, electrician Carl Pritchard, 24, are preparing to remortgage their property after their fixed rate deal ended last month. Uneasy: Carl Pritchard and Tiffany Clayton don't like the uncertainty of . being on Halifax's SVR and are looking to fix again . The couple, from Caterham, Surrey, are now paying Halifax’s 3.99 per cent SVR after their two-year 4.2 per cent fixed-rate deal ended on April 9. But although the SVR is lower than the fixed rate, the couple are uncomfortable with a floating rate that they fear could rise further. Miss Clayton said: ‘I have already spoken to an independent broker about remortgaging. We definitely want another fixed rate. ‘We have equity in the property so we should be able to fix for two years at an even lower rate than 3.99 per cent. This is our preferred option because we don’t want sleepless nights about rates going up.’ Up to eight million homeowners are thought to be on a variable rate, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. This includes those on tracker deals as well as those on the SVR.  However, many of those on fixed rates will have to remortgage in the coming months as their deal expires. Experts said cheap deals are being replaced every day by more expensive options. Last Friday, Yorkshire Building Society raised its two-year fixed rate loan from 3.24 per cent to 3.54 per cent. Tomorrow ING Direct will raise its two-year fixed from 3.29 per cent to 3.49 per cent. Any hike of interest rates risks sparking a fresh rise in the number of home reposessions, which had stabilised only this month. The 9,600 repossessions between January and the beginning of April was the same number as a year ago, according to data from the CML, breaking the recent trend of year-on-year increases. Record-low interest rates have helped mortgage borrowers in the past two years, despite the banks lending at much higher rates than the Bank of England 0.5 per cent base rate, and 2011 saw the lowest annual number of repossessions in four years - at 36,200 homes. The CML had said it could this summer revise the expected number of homes reposessed in 2012 down from 45,000, but the fresh warning over interest rates has now put that at risk. Presciently, the CML said in a statement last week: 'Continuing pressures on household finances, changes to welfare benefits and an upward drift in mortgage rates all have the potential to disrupt the current stable picture.' The Bank of England said the eurozone crisis is beginning to hit homeowners, many of whom are already struggling to to make their monthly repayments . Una Farrell, of debt advisers the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, warned: ‘The margin between being able to pay your mortgage and falling into arrears is paper-thin for many. ‘Even a small increase in their mortgage costs will push many over the edge.’ Around one in ten homeowners with a loan are in ‘some form of distress’, which typically means they have fallen behind with their repayments, according to the CCCS. One of the charges levelled against the banks is that they are raising rates even though the Bank of England base rate has been frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009. Marc Gander of the Consumer Action Group, said: ‘The taxpayer imagines that part of the deal is that, having rescued the banks, they will help homeowners and businesses. But people are thinking to themselves “This is not happening”.’ A Council of Mortgage Lenders spokesman said it was wrong to assume that banks could borrow money at 0.5 per cent base rate. She said: ‘Effectively, the cost to the lender of borrowing money from savers has risen. ‘Also, problems in the eurozone have been causing significant difficulties in recent months, and funding costs  are higher than they were a year ago.’ Enlarge . The financial regulator has warned that homeowners in their 50s are sitting on ‘a ticking timebomb’ of mortgages handed out during the boom years. During a grilling by MPs last month, Martin Wheatley, a director of the Financial Services Authority, raised his fears about interest-only mortgages which are coming to the end of their life – but the homeowners have no money to pay off the loan. Of the 11.2million mortgages in Britain, about four in ten are interest-only, meaning the homeowners pay only the interest but not a penny of the actual loan. Between 2011 and 2020, the FSA expects about 1.5million such mortgages – worth a staggering £120billion – ‘will be due for repayment’. Mr Wheatley told the Treasury select committee: ‘There is a ticking timebomb that has been created over the last 20 years.’ The FSA said its figures mean 150,000 interest-only mortgages will come to the end of their life every year for the next decade. The vast majority of people with these types of loans – 80 per cent – have ‘no repayment strategy’, the FSA said.","Experts fear some of Britain's 11.2million mortgage holders may be 'pushed over the edge' by hikes .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Britain's overheating housing market finally appears to be cooling - as figures revealed mortgage lending had stalled last month. Some £16.5 billion-worth of home loans were handed out in May, matching the figure for the month before according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders said. Despite holding steady month-on-month, lending is still 'substantially' higher than a year ago, with lending in May some 12 per cent higher than the year before. After months of increased lending, mortgage lending finally slowed down in May. The figures come amid growing evidence that the housing market is slowly starting to cool . Council of Mortgage Lenders chief Bob Pannell blamed the 'softening in the pace of recovery' was linked to tougher mortgage rules which came into force at the end of April. He said the recent 'softening in the pace of recovery' would appear to back up reports that demand in London, where the market has been at its most heated, is starting to cool. The new Mortgage Market Review rules mean lenders have to grill mortgage applicants more thoroughly about their spending habits, to make sure that their repayments will be affordable. Chancellor George Osborne announced plans last week to hand the Bank of England powerful new tools which would give it the power to cap the size of mortgages based on people's salaries or the value of the house. It comes after the Business Secretary Vince Cable warned against a premature rise in interest rates. The Lib Dem Cabinet Minister sounded the alarm about homebuyers who are being lent mortgages equal to ‘five times’ their salary. An outspoken critic of Britain’s banks, Mr Cable questioned whether such super-size loans were ‘sensible’. Chancellor George Osborne has introduced new rules for banks to check whether families can afford mortgage repayments, in a bid to avoid a fresh house price bubble . He warned that the overheating housing market could lead to a premature rise in interest rates which would jeopardise the recovery. Mr Cable said: ‘There is a risk that the destabilising effects of the rise in house prices, certainly in London and the South East, potentially has a major impact on the economy as a whole. ‘If, for example, interest rates were to rise sooner than they otherwise would have done on the basis of the overall position of the economy, then this potentially is a negative consequence of the imbalance that is happening.’ His comments came as the Bank of England gave its strongest signal yet that interest rates will rise before the end of the year – pushing up mortgage costs of millions of families. Mr Cable said a home loan which is five times bigger than a worker’s salary ‘must raise all kinds of questions about whether this is sensible for lenders and sensible for borrowers’. Mr Cable said the ‘traditional’ model was to lend around three to 3.5 times’ somebody’s salary. The Office for National Statistics this week said house prices have risen by nearly 19 per cent in London over the last year. This is the second fastest rise in house prices in the capital since its records began, and means the average London home now costs nearly £500,000. In Mr Cable’s constituency of Twickenham, the average person who lives in the leafy London borough and works full-time in the area earns £33,000. But the average house price is nearly £595,000, according to the property website Zoopla. If they want to buy a house, they would need to borrow a mortgage which is 18 times bigger than their salary. The Bank of England this week dropped hints that interest rates could rise sooner than expected, which would add to the costs of mortgage-holders, although any increase is expected to be gradual. Average UK house prices have hit a new peak of £260,000 after leaping by 9.9 per cent over the last year, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics this week. But in a sign of what is to come, property website Rightmove also reported this week that it is seeing evidence that house-sellers’ asking prices are starting to come 'off the boil', with property values in some parts of London appearing to have hit the ceiling of what buyers will pay. Rightmove said the new Government rules have already dampened housing market demand, with estate agents reporting that some lenders are initially applying the new rules in a 'knee jerk' way, leading to house sales falling through. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has also said that the recent sharp rises in some house prices and the stricter mortgage lending rules are starting to take some of the strongest heat out of the property market. Speculation that further steps could be taken to cool the market has also been growing.","Some £16.5 billion-worth of mortgages handed in May - the same as April .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Victim: Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca was shot dead by a border agent in 2010 . A 15-year-old boy shot dead by a border patrol agent was protected by the U.S. Constitution even though he was on Mexican soil when he was shot, a federal appeals court ruled yesterday. The ruling from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals means the family of Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca can move forward with a civil lawsuit against the agent. The Mexican teenager was killed while he played with friends near a border bridge in 2010. 'This recognizes human rights belong . to everyone. Not just American citizens,' or people standing on U.S. soil, said Bob Hilliard, one of the lawyers representing the family. The . original lawsuit was filed against the Border Patrol, the Department of . Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, agent Jesus Mesa and . the U.S. Department of Justice. But part of the ruling relieves the agent's supervisors and the agencies from responsibility. 'The . appellants [do not point to] any other evidence that would suggest that . the supervisors were personally responsible for the alleged . constitutional violation,' the ruling says. Hilliard said the family will likely appeal that part of the ruling. Both the government and Mesa can also appeal the ruling. The Border Patrol said it would not comment on the matter because it opens the possibility of litigation. Warning: graphic content . Lawsuit: The family of 15-year-old Sergio, pictured above after he was shot, will be able to take legal action against the agent responsible for his death . Mesa's attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press. Mesa . shot Hernandez in 2010 near a border bridge between El Paso and Ciudad . Juarez while trying to arrest immigrants who crossed illegally into the . United States. Mesa said he was attacked by stone throwers. Border Patrol agents are allowed to shoot at stone throwers if they feel their lives or those in their custody are at risk. U.S. District Judge David Briones found in 2011 that the family could not sue because the shooting's effects were 'felt in Mexico'. But the appeals court said that 'territorial approach' would allow agents to establish 'zones of lawlessness'. It 'would establish a perverse rule that would treat differently two individuals subject to the same conduct merely because one managed to cross into our territory,' the appeals court ruling says. Reaction: Protests over Sergio's death and violence along the border were held in June 2010 . It also says that giving people standing on Mexican soil protection from 'conscience shocking' actions by border agents, such as the shooting of Hernandez Guereca, is not a new policy. Immigrants who are inside the U.S., even those who are to be removed from the country, 'are entitled to feel free of gross physical abuse by federal agents', it says. Extending that right to people injured across the border by U.S. agents standing on U.S. soil, would inform the officials that they are not allowed to arbitrarily inflict harm in this 'new, but similar, context,' the court said. 'Today the Fifth Circuit helped ensure that CBP agents are held accountable for shocking and outrageous abuse, even when their victims aren't inside the U.S. ... The Fifth Circuit clearly signaled that Border Patrol cannot operate with impunity,' American Civil Liberties Union senior staff attorney Adriana Pinon said in a statement. The ACLU was not directly involved but filed a friend of the court brief in the case.","Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca died on the Mexican side of the border in 2010 .

"By . Steve Nolan . It may be worth almost half the price of the average UK house and have a top speed of 217mph, but the long arm of the law still managed to catch up with the driver of this supercar yesterday. The orange Lamborghini Aventador, worth a staggering £400,000, was seized and towed away by police after they found that its driver's insurance policy didn't quite cover him to be behind its luxury wheel. The car was without doubt the most expensive of more than 180 cars seized by police in east London as part of a crackdown on uninsured drivers. And it is the latest in a batch of brightly coloured supercars to fall foul of the law of the capital's roads in recent months. Seized: This Lamborghini Aventador was seized by police in east London yesterday after it was discovered that the driver was uninsured . Towed away: Police gather round the £400,000 supercar as it is secured to a tow vehicle in Newham . The orange supercar was initially stopped by officers in Newham as it had no front number plate, and further checks revealed the driver was not the registered owner. The car - which does 0-62mph in 2.9 seconds and has an impressive top speed of 217mph - was seized as part of Operation Cubo yesterday when police discovered the driver had insufficient insurance to be driving the car. Thirty-seven arrests were made for vehicle-related crime, including drink driving, driving without insurance and robbery. Chief Superintendent Sultan Taylor of the Met’s safer transport command said: 'We work to keep the travelling public safe and part of our duty includes carrying out operations such as Cubo which help to keep uninsured and dangerous drivers off London’s roads. Impressive: The car does 0-62mph in 2.9 seconds and has an impressive top speed of 217mph . The car is just one of a menagerie of especially flashy vehicles spotted on the capital's roads this summer. But many of the cars' drivers have seen their pride and joy either slapped with a fine or impounded after parking illegally or not having the right paperwork to be driving the cars. Dozens of supercars have been seized on an array of charges including driving without a proper number plate. Another Lamborghini Aventador, this time a 'glow in the dark' model, was seized after its driver – believed to be a Qatari royal – was caught driving uninsured and without a licence. It was later displayed outside Scotland Yard, covered with police tape reading 'uninsured vehicle seized by police'. At the time a police spokesman said: 'We have had a few Porsches, BMW X5s, and a Ferrari – that one got crushed and in fact the vast majority of them are.'

And a member of Qatar's Al-Thani dynasty has had two supercars towed away by police. The influx of foreign registered super cars to the UK was highlighted in a Channel 4 documentary earlier this year. Viewers saw residents of the upmarket Knightsbridge area of London - home to Harrods - complain that their lives were being made a misery by super rich Arab playboy racers speeding around residential streets.

The capital's most affluent areas are often awash with super cars during the summer months, with the wealthy Arab elite escaping the searing heat of their own countries and embarking on a six week tour of Europe's top cities, including London. Many of them bring their cars with them during the tour, known as The Season. Last summer, five rare vehicles thought to be worth around £5million were spotted parked outside the Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair. Overstated: This £2 million Bugatti Veron car was flown over to London by rich Arabs last year who spend June in London shopping ahead of Ramadan last year .

It is believed that the cars all belonged to one Saudi businessman.

A Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe in pink and an all yellow Ferrari S99 registered in Saudi have also been spotted cruising the capital's streets. Perhaps one of the most garish cars spotted in London this year was a Ferrari 599, parked outside a designer store in Sloane Square. The car was impressive enough - reaching top speeds of 205mph and 0 to 60mph in 3.7 seconds - but this one was wrapped in black velvet. Some 11,576 vehicles have been seized during 22 one-day operations since the launch of Cubo in October 2012. Costly: A £1 million Qatari registered Pagani Huayra and an orange Lamborghini .

"By . Jill Reilly . Weddings can be expensive occasions not just for the bride and groom - but for their guests too. But it was perhaps surprising to learn that even Prince William can feel the pinch - this weekend he was spotted in economy class when he took an internal flight in the US after celebrating his friend Guy Pelly’s marriage. Prince William, who was in America with Prince Harry, took the American Airlines flight from Memphis to Dallas on Sunday. Prince William, who is in America with Prince Harry to celebrate his friend Guy Pelly's marriage, took the American Air flight from Memphis to Dallas on Sunday . The photo has re-tweeted dozens of times since it was posted on Twitter at the weekend. One user commented they thought he flew economy because it kept the cost down for the security detail . The photo was taken by US television reporter Eli Ross who was on the American Airlines flight - he posted the image on Twitter writing: 'I am still amazed #Prince William flies COACH. That's pretty humble/awesome. Who knew?' The photo was taken by US television reporter Eli Ross who was on the flight - he posted the image on Twitter writing: 'I am still amazed #Prince William flies COACH. That's pretty humble/awesome.

The cost of the trip itself is being met privately by both the princes - Prince William is understood to have changed planes at Dallas Fort Worth to return to the UK. On the American Airlines plane he took a . window seat and is understood to have ordered water during the 1hour 30 . domestic flight. A similar flight was on sale today for £250. Holding his hand luggage he boarded a plane separately to the rest of the passengers in Memphis, surrounded by security officers. The 31-year-old was then photographed at the Dallas airport wearing jeans, a pale blue shirt, white trainers and a baseball cap as he left the American Airlines Admiral Club.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A call girl has told a court she is 'deeply ashamed' about taking selfies next to the body of a dead teacher who she and her boyfriend are alleged to have injected with a lethal dose of heroin. Kirsty Edmondson, 23, and Christopher Sawyers, 36, are accused of killing 47-year old former history teacher Kenneth Chapman at a flat in Eccles, near Salford, by injecting him with the drug. As he lay dead, the pair used mobiles phones to take 'trophy photos' of themselves before having sex on his bed, jurors were told. Kirsty Edmondson, 23, left, and Christopher Sawyers, 36, killed a former history teacher by giving him a lethal dose of heroin, a court heard. They are alleged to have taken 'trophy pictures' of themselves with the corpse . The pair killed former history teacher Kenneth Chapman, pictured, at a flat in Eccles, near Salford, a court heard. They then allegedly lived with his body for up to a week before stealing his money and television . The pair lived with Mr Chapman’s corpse . for up to a week - during which time they stole his TV and computer before raiding . his bank account in a string of online frauds, Manchester Crown Court was told. They even texted the victim’s sister pretending to be the deceased asking if she could lend him . £75. Later Sawyers allegedly showed one of the . photos to his friends saying: 'Look at this. I will show you a photo of a . corpse.' Chapman’s body was eventually found on January 12 this year - 15 days after his death. It is alleged the pair murdered Chapman after they discovered he was sitting on £18,000 following the sale of his house. But in court today, Edmondson insisted she was not a 'cold, callous killer' She added she 'wouldn't kill anybody' before insisting: 'I’m not a killer, it’s not how it looks' Call girl Edmondson told Manchester Crown Court today she was 'deeply ashamed' of what had happened - and insisted the alleged murder 'wasn't what it looked like' The court heard how the 23-year-old had been having a fling with the victim after he used her services. She told the court Mr Chapman was the 'best person I knew in my life' Edmondson, who admits stealing money and property, told the court today she was 'deeply ashamed of what I have done before and after he died.' She continued: 'I might not be sat here bawling but . when I go back to that sweat box and realise everything that’s happened, . believe me, I’m paying for it. 'I would never kill Kenneth Chapman. I wouldn’t kill anyone but I definitely wouldn’t kill him. 'I’m not that type of person. I have . got no reason to want him dead. I didn’t do anything towards killing . him. Christopher Sawyers did.' Edmondson and Sawyers, who is known by the nickname Twinny, both deny the murder. The court heard how Edmondson had been . having a fling with the victim who is originally of Cockburnspath, near . Berwick-upon-Tweed after Mr Chapman began using her services. Mr Chapman's body was found 15 days after he died in a flat in Eccles, pictured. During the time the pair lived with his body, they texted his sister pretending to be the deceased and asked for £75 . In her defence Edmondson said she . stole Chapman’s TV, games console and bank cards - but claimed he was semi-conscious after being injected with the drug when she did so. When asked about the selfies she replied: 'I don’t know the reason for taking it. I’m not a killer, it’s not how it looks. 'Twinny asked me if Ken had any family who could put money in. I said he had a sister and he told me to text asking so I did.' She . said she was petrified of Sawyer and he forced her to lie and cover up . events until she eventually spoke to the police on January 14 - two days . after Mr Chapman’s body was found. The prosecution showed Edmondson the 'trophy photos' in court and said: 'This is an example of how cold and callous your are' She added: 'It was eating me up inside that Ken’s body had been found. 'I told the police he had overdosed. Twinny kept getting it in my head that if I told the truth and he had done it then I would be going to prison for it with him.' 'My head was f*****, my life was f*****. My life was not normal before him [Sawyers]. I had Ken and was doing what I do but it was my normality. I met him and my life went upside down. 'He killed the best person I knew in my life. I’ve had time to reflect in prison for the last four months. I know what he did and I was there and seen it. 'Twinny told me we were both going to prison if we didn’t stick together. I don’t know why I stuck by him, it was just a situation that got out of control. 'I felt like I couldn’t go nowhere because I had to make money to look after both of us. 'I could have gone to the police but I thought I would be doing myself harm. I thought I was going to prison for murder. 'If you are never in that situation you don’t know what you will do. I was petrified of him.' But Tony Cross QC prosecuting showed Edmondson one of the pictures taken after Chapman’s death saying: 'This is an example of how cold and callous you are - this is a photo taken on the evening you had killed Kenneth Chapman. 'You told your representative these photos were when you were smashed out of your face. Being off your head does not provide you with a defence. 'No-one forced the camera into your hands. Christopher Sawyers wasn’t threatening you. 'He didn’t arrange you in the sitting room. You were standing within touching distance of the corpse of Kenneth Chapman. This is a trophy photo.' Sawyers also denies the manslaughter of former accountant Peter Clark, . 60, who suffered a fatal heart attack after he was given heroin on July 5 . 2012. The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Nearly half of Britons admitted to giving up on jobs halfway through, with incompetence, busy schedules and boredom being the most common reasons . We may like to think we have a do it yourself mentality… but half of Britons surveyed admit they fail to complete home improvement jobs. Bleeding radiators, fitting loft insulation and installing a new boiler are the main jobs we leave unfinished. Energy company E.ON asked more than 2,000 adults about the work they carry out at home. Some 44 per cent said they fail to complete DIY jobs. This is because 25 per cent said they are no good at it, 24 per cent do not have enough spare time and 16 per cent just get bored and give up. Londoners are the least likely to finish the job, with 32 per cent admitting they do not achieve their DIY goals. Those in the West Midlands are the most likely, with an 85 per cent success rate, followed by Wales, at 84 per cent, the East Midlands at 82 per cent and Yorkshire at 81 per cent. Women are more likely than men to complete a project, with 78 per cent of females seeing tasks through to the end, compared to only 76 per cent of men. Finance worker Matthew Allen from Southampton, Hampshire, admits making home improvements is 'incredibly boring'. Women are more likely to follow a task through to completion, with 77% claiming to see projects to the end, compared to only 76% for men . Londoners are the least likely to finish DIY jobs, while those in the West Midlands are the most determined to get things done . The 38-year-old said: 'I wanted to add loft insulation to my house because it was getting cold in the winter - but I gave up half way through. 'It was just incredibly dull, boring and unpleasant.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated  Press Reporter . The mother of a Guatemalan boy whose body was found in the desert about a mile from Texas’ southern border said Tuesday she begged him not to make the dangerous journey from the Cuchumatanes mountains – but he didn’t listen. Cipriana Juarez Diaz, who suffers from epilepsy and is bedridden, said her son Gilberto told her he wanted to earn money to help her. ‘I told him not to go but he wanted to help me get rid of my illness,’ said Juarez Diaz. Too young: In an undated photo taken with a mobile phone, provided by the Ramos Juarez family, Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez, 15, poses in an unidentified location in Guatemala . Heartbroken: Cipriana Juarez Diaz recalled how she told her son Gilberto Francisco not to leave their home, but he insisted on making the trek to the U.S. border . Confusion: Even though Gilberto Francisco was 15 years old, his birth certificate states he was 11 because he was erroneously listed as a twin of his 11-year-old brother, Gilberto Haroldo (pictured) Before Gilberto set out from his family’s humble cinder-block and sheet-metal home, his mother draped him with a white rosary. ‘He was a good son,’ she said. ‘I just hope God gives me the strength to bear seeing his body when they bring him to me.’ Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez was found with the rosary still around his neck and a brother’s Chicago phone number scribbled on the inside of his belt buckle about two weeks ago. He was alone in brush less than a mile from the nearest U.S. home, a South Texas sheriff said Monday. He apparently got lost on his way north and likely died from the elements. An autopsy did not find signs of trauma. His birth certificate says he was 11 years old. But his father, Francisco Ramos Diaz, said Tuesday that the boy was really 15. Meager possessions: Francisco Ramos Diaz, father of Gilberto Francisco, shows the boy's clothing at their home in San Jose Las Flores, northern Cuchumatanes mountains . Devoted son: Cipriana Juarez Diaz said her son was determined to earn money in the U.S. so she could find a cure for her epilepsy . Special bond: Because the parents couldn¿t remember the exact date of Gilberto Francisco's birth, they gave the same date for him and his 11-year-old brother (pictured) Keeping the faith: Two images of the virgin Mary and a rosary hang on a wall at the Ramos Juarez's home . Ramos Diaz said Gilberto’s birth certificate carried the birth date of his younger brother because it took the family several years to register him. Because the parents couldn’t remember the exact date of Gilberto’s birth, they gave the same date for both young sons, who became listed as twins. Gilberto set out from chilly, rugged terrain, the peaks and canyons of an area only accessible by dirt road. Associated Press reporters hiked a rocky, muddy path for 45 minutes to reach the village. The boy’s family said they had last heard from him about 25 days before his body was found. At that time, he was in Reynosa, Mexico, waiting to cross the border. His father told authorities the boy was traveling with a migrant smuggler. Investigators were able to reach the boy’s brother in Chicago; his phone number was one of three on the boy’s belt. It’s not uncommon for immigrants to put relatives’ phone numbers on their clothing because scraps of paper can get lost or wet during their journey.

Harsh landscape: Gilberto set out from chilly, rugged terrain, the peaks and canyons of an area only accessible by dirt road .

The boy’s brother gave authorities his father’s phone number in Guatemala, and the dad identified the boy’s personal items. The cause of death has not been determined, but authorities suspect heat stroke, Guerra said. The boy was no longer wearing a shirt when he was found. Gilberto, wearing Angry Birds jeans, black leather boots and a white rosary around his neck, had apparently gotten lost on his way north from his native country and was found June 15, alone in the brush less than a mile from the nearest U.S. home, a South Texas sheriff said Monday. While hundreds of immigrants die crossing the border each year, the discovery of the teenager's decomposed remains highlights the perils unaccompanied children face as the U.S. government searches for ways to deal with record numbers of children crossing into the country illegally. Tragic: The boy had his brother's Chicago phone number written on the inside of his belt buckle when he was his body was found in the desert . Heartbreaking: The 11-year-old boy's Abgry Birds jeans helped authorities identify his body . 'Down here finding a decomposed body ... we come across them quite often,' Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra said, adding that this was the first child immigrant his office has found since he became sheriff in April. 'It's a very dangerous journey.' More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been apprehended entering the U.S. illegally since October, creating what President Barack Obama has called an 'urgent humanitarian situation.' On Monday, Obama asked Congress for more money and additional authority to deal with the surge of youths, mostly from Central America. Obama wants flexibility to speed the youths' deportations and $2billion in new money to hire more immigration judges and open more detention facilities. The number of unaccompanied immigrant children arrested along the border has been rising for three years as they fled pervasive gang violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. More recently, children and parents have said they heard children traveling alone and parents traveling with young kids would be released by authorities and allowed to continue to their destination. Long hike: The boy was found wearing black boots on his long, hot journey through the desert . Common: Sheriff Eddie Guerra says finding decomposing bodies of immigrants in the desert is not uncommon . Many of the . children turn themselves in to the first law enforcement person they . see, so Guerra said it was unusual to find a child in this more remote . area — near La Joya, about 20 miles west of McAllen. About . 445 immigrants died along the U.S.-Mexico border last year, according . to the Border Patrol. The Pima County medical examiner in Arizona, which . is the perennial leader in immigrant deaths, recorded 168 of the . deaths; of the 70 where an age was confirmed, none were younger than 13.

The press conference followed her victory against the Israeli in the first round of the Wimbledon Championships. Asked about Lopez’s presence at all of her recent matches, Wozniacki laughed: ‘You noticed that, huh? 'Yeah, I noticed he was on the sidelines in Eastbourne. He’s a great guy. This is awkward.’ When asked about how the Spaniard knows and respects her father, Wozniacki joked: 'He's already making his way in through my dad?' Hard to get? The Danish player said she was 'happy' being single - and that it was 'pretty hard' to sweep her off her feet. Evidently trying to do just that, Lopez said he admired Wozniacki's father in a recent press conference . Later, when pressed about whether she had considered internet dating, Wozniacki continued: 'I think I'm not that desperate. I'll just see what happens. 'I'm perfectly fine being single at the moment. It's pretty hard to sweep me off my feet. 'It would have to take someone very special. I guess when you least expect it, it's going to come. Right now I'm just into my tennis. And playing here, it's great. That's what I'm focused on.' 32-year-old Lopez was dubbed . ‘Deliciano’ in 2011 by Andy Murray’s mother Judy, who revealed she was a fan of the player's good looks. In a series of tweets, Judy joked: 'Ooh Deliciano… . looking good out there. As always.' Evidently mortified, her son hit back - saying her antics were 'disgusting.' New love: Spaniard Lopez took time out before his first match to watch Wozniacki finishing off a 6-3 6-0 victory over Israel's Shahar Peer on Court 12 (pictured) Crush: Judy Murray, pictured court side earlier this week left, dubbed Lopez 'Deliciano' in a series of tweets in 2011. Until now, Wozniacki has asked reporters not to mention her relationship with McIlroy, right . Following a four-set win over Ivan Ljubicic at the 2011 championships, Murray said: 'I think it’s about time she stopped that nonsense. It’s making me throw up. It’s disgusting.' The player, who knows Lopez well, added his mother had been behaving inappropriately while the two had been practising. The Scot added: 'I was practising with him before the tournament. 'It's quite funny because she’d been writing about it on Twitter like all the time. And I was practising with him before the tournament and my mum was on the side.' Wozniacki will tackle Britain's Naomi Broady in her second round match - played today at 8pm. Of the match, the Danish player said: 'I don't really know much about her, so I'll have to have my team do a little bit of research and some scouting.'","Caroline Wozniacki giggled and blushed when asked about Feliciano Lopez .

"By . David Mccormack . Woodstock is not only one of the most famous music festivals of all time, it was also one of the defining moments of the 1960s counter-culture movement. What started as a free event advertised for 50,000, quickly turned into one of the most important music festival in history, attended by over half a million people, united in a message of peace, love, openness and cultural expression. Rolling Stone magazine’s first photographer Baron Wolman was sent to Max Yasgur's farm in the Catskills, upstate New York, to cover the festival and now 45 years later he has released a book featuring previously unreleased photographs of the era-defining event.

Rolling Stone magazine¿s first photographer Baron Wolman was sent to Max Yasgur's farm in the Catskills, upstate New York, to cover the festival and now 45 years later he has released a book featuring previously unreleased photographs of the era-defining event . ‘No one could have predicted the enduring influence of the Woodstock experience,’ said Wolman, now 76. ‘Yes, the bands were first rate and there were many of them. And the setting … was picture perfect and tranquil, a bucolic setting for relaxing with friends and listening to music and getting high. But in unexpected ways, Woodstock became more than a concert for all of us.’ Although assigned with a brief to photograph what was happening on stage, Wolman found himself more inspired by the crowds of hippies than the performers. ‘I ended up spending most of my time out in the wild with the crowd because what was happening “out there” was just too interesting not to explore.’ The book features a Q&A with photographer Baron Wolman and Woodstock creator Michael Lang who share their personal experiences of Woodstock .

'I ended up spending most of my time out in the wild with the crowd because what was happening ""out there"" was just too interesting not to explore,' said Wolman . During the sometimes rainy weekend, 32 acts performed outdoors before an audience of over 500,000 young people at Max Yasgur's 600-acre dairy farm in the Catskills . The influx of attendees to the rural concert site in Bethel created a massive traffic jam . More interested in the crowd than the performers, his photographs are hugely evocative and offer an insight into this legendary event that is rarely seen. ‘The thing to remember about the 1960s, even near the end in ‘69 was that everything was totally different, the behavior was new and unexpected. 'Plus, the 1960s were simply wildly photogenic in every way imaginable ... the changes that were taking place in the heads of the people were visually manifested. I mean, how could you not take pictures?’ Released to commemorate the 45th anniversary, Woodstock features Wolman's stunning black and white photographs, the majority of which are published for the first time. The images perfectly capture the zeitgeist, the music, the drugs, the people, the sheer hedonism; the enduring legacy of the most famous festival ever.

The book also features a foreword by musician Carlos Santana and a Q&A with Wolman and Woodstock creator, Michael Lang, who share their personal experiences of Woodstock. Also included is Wolman’s contact sheets in their entirety, including outtakes. ‘It is a rare and fascinating treat when photographers allow us to see their contact sheets,’ said contributor Dave Brolan. ‘What is remarkable about this selection of contact sheets is that almost every frame is as good as the next, and we get to see Woodstock exactly as Baron saw it, every single unbelievable moment.’ Wolman began the music phase of his photographic career in 1967, as the very first photographer for the new Rolling Stone magazine. He went on to capture the 60s pop rock explosion, including: Janis Joplin, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan amongst many more. ‘I see myself as a kind of voyeur … I’m happiest when I’m invisible and watching. … I’m a chameleon and can adapt myself to the situation, and that, to me, is one of the gifts that I was given naturally, and that’s how you get honest pictures.’ Woodstock by Baron Wolman is published by Reel Art Press and includes Wolman’s contact sheets in their entirety, including outtakes .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . The cast and crew of axed BBC drama Ripper Street were today filming the show's third series after the Victorian costume drama was saved by online giant Amazon. The show, set in London's Whitechapel in 1889 - six months after the gruesome Jack The Ripper Murders, was axed by the BBC at the end of last year due to poor viewing figures. There were also some issues with sound -  with dozens of viewers complaining to the BBC about  'meaningless mumbling' throughout the second series. On set: The cast and crew of Ripper Street, which was axed by the BBC last year before being saved by Amazon, was being filmed in Dublin today. Pictured is Jerome Flynn - or Detective Sergeant Bennet Drake - getting ready for a scene . Action: Jerome Flynn sits on a bench as two child actors make their way towards him during filming. The show was dropped by the BBC in December 2013 after the second series attracted poor ratings . Takes: The actor, best known for appearing in hit HBO series Game of Thrones, chats to one of the members of crew during a blustery day of filming. Amazon announced it would be funding the show in February . But thankfully for fans, it was saved by online retailer Amazon - who have funded the third series along with production company Tiger Aspect. It will be aired on Amazon Prime Instant Video - formerly LOVEFilLM - in the autumn before being shown on BBC One a few months later. And, if today's pictures are anything to go by, filming for the latest series - which will see the return of crime-fighting duo Matthew Macfadyen and Jerome Flynn - appears to be going swimmingly. Jerome Flynn - or Detective Sergeant Bennet Drake as he is known in the show - could be seen milling about on locations in full costume, chatting to numerous members of cast and crew. Happy to be on set: The actor embraces a female friend during filming. The third series of Ripper Street will be aired on Amazon Prime Instant Video - formerly LOVEFiLM - in autumn . Matthew Macfadyen, or Detective Inspector Edmund Reid, was also on location today - dressed in full Victorian costume. The show will be shown on the BBC a few months after it airs on the Amazon service . Hungry work! Matthew Macfadyen popped out of his trailer for a spot of lunch at one point in the day. Amazon's decision to fund the series was the first time an on-demand service had taken on a show after it was dropped . Fed: The Spooks actor later left his trailer - no doubt for a hard afternoon's filming . Meanwhile, in one series of pictures, Matthew Macfadyen - who plays Detective Inspector Edmund Reid - could be seen dashing out of his trailer to get a spot of lunch. Elsewhere, groups of ladies were battling the elements - holding down their skirts in blustery conditions. Amazon decision to save the gruesome Victorian drama marked the first time an on-demand video service stepped in to fund a drama series after it was dropped by a broadcaster. Following the announcement in February, BBC drama boss Ben Stephenson said the deal was 'an exceptional opportunity' to bring the show back - while freeing up BBC money for new drama series. Tiger . Aspect’s Head of Drama, Will Gould added: 'In the past year we’ve transmitted . two series of Ripper Street in the UK, had highs of eight million viewers, sold . the show to over 150 countries, got Bafta nominated and voted Radio Times best . show of the year, were cancelled and resurrected. Cast: Scores of extras - including this gentleman with an rather large beard - joined the main characters on set today for the day of filming. The U.S. version of the show will be filmed and funded by BBC America . Waiting around: Crew members take a break during filming. When the Amazon takeover was announced, BBC drama boss Ben Stephenson said the deal was an 'exceptional opportunity' for the show . Do like to be beside the seaside! Actors line up with donkeys during filming. The series, set in London's East End in 1889, will see a return of all of the series's best-loved characters .

'And of course we’re indebted to our incredible fans that . have been so vocal and passionate and spurred us on. The third series promises . to be the best yet.' On-demand services commissioning their own series is not a new phenomenon, however. Netflix has now successfully produced six series - including Lilyhammer, House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black. Windy? Some of the ladies struggled with their dresses as the wind whipped around them . Protection: Even Jerome Flynn struggled with the weather - putting up an umbrella to shelter under . As it was: Jerome Flynn, Matthew Macfadyen and Adam Rothenbergh in the pilot episode of the series . #It has also produced three series for children, along with numerous specials, mini-series and films. In a recent interview with the Guardian, Neil Hunt, Chief Product Officer for Netflix, said they would continue to make more originals following the popularity of their previous offerings. He told the newspaper: 'I think we are going to end up doing a lot more originals over time. 'The world of internet TV kind of means that not all shows have to be 13 episodes times 42 minutes.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . Amtrak workers have gone back to school after a New York City-bound train took a wrong turn and wound up in the Philadelphia suburbs on Thursday. Officials are investigating how Amtrak Train 644 got onto the wrong tracks after leaving Philadelphia's 30th Street . Station for Penn Station. The . train traveled several miles before crew realized their mistake and stopped at Bala Cynwyd station. What the? Amtrak Train 644 left 30th Street Station for New York City on Thursday but bizarrely ended up at a local Philadelphia train station . The local train station is serviced by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. The train allegedly missed a signal after leaving Philadelphia. The 130 passengers were returned to Philadelphia where they boarded another train for the Big Apple. Amtrak’s media relations director, Steve Kulm, said the crew members are being re-trained. 'An investigation was . launched and the crew has been held out of work until they can be fully . debriefed and additional training can be conducted,' he said in a statement, according to CBS Philly. Well, that's embarrassing: Amtrak crew took a wrong turn, landing at Bala Cynwyd station after leaving 30th Station in Philadelphia instead of heading to New York Cuty . Amtrak, or the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, has been widely criticized for its ongoing issues with scheduling, delays and 'second-rate service'. The federal organization has reportedly never turned a profit since it began 40 years ago, while consuming almost $40 billion in federal subsidies. According to its website, Amtrak earned approximately $2.51 billion in revenue and incurred approximately $3.74 billion in expense in the 2010 financial year. In his 2010 book, National Association of Railroad Passengers founder Anthony Haswell described Amtrak as a 'massive failure because it’s wedded to a failed paradigm'. 'It runs trains that serve political purposes as opposed to being responsive to the marketplace,' he wrote. 'America needs passenger trains in selected areas, but it doesn’t need Amtrak’s antiquated route system, poor service and unreasonable operating deficits.' Last week, Congress held the latest in a series of hearings on Amtrak's inability to manage its food service.The Atlantic Cities reported Amtrak has lost more than $609 million on food and beverage since 2006. Meanwhile, Charlotte Observer reported an Amtrack collided with a car in west Charlotte on Monday, while Chicago News Tribune said a Detroit-bound train from Chicago stopped for six hours outside a station because of an equipment problem two days ago.

"By . Sara Malm . Justin Bieber has been accused of abusing a flight attendant on a private jet until she was forced to hide in the cockpit. The troubled teen singer and his entourage were also said to have smoked so much marijuana on the flight between Canada and New Jersey that the pilots were forced to wear oxygen masks. Bieber, 19, his father Jeremy, 38, and ten friends travelled on the leased jet to Teterboro airport ahead of the Superbowl and were allegedly so verbally abusive towards the female flight attendant that she refuses to work for him again. Scroll down for video . Accused: When Justin Bieber, pictured in New York on Monday, flew a . private jet from Canada to New York City to watch the Superbowl he . allegedly smoked to much marijuana on the plane the pilots had to wear . oxygen masks . Despite several warnings, the singer and his father Jeremy would not stop verbally abusing the flight attendant, and she eventually hid in cockpit with the pilots to avoid Bieber and his entourage. According to an official report, Justin Bieber and his father Jeremy were 'extremely abusive' towards the flight attendant. ‘The captain of the flight stated that he warned the passengers, including Bieber, on several occasions to stop smoking marijuana,’ the official report of the incident, obtained by NBC News, reads. ‘The captain also stated he needed to request that the passengers stop their harassing behavior toward the flight attendant and after several warnings asked the flight attendant to stay with him near the cockpit to avoid any further abuse.’ On the morning after the jet was searched, Justin Bieber was spotted out in NYC posing for pictures with his adoring fans in the snow . False alarm: A police search found nothing suspicious and Bieber and his entourage were free to go . In trouble again? Justin Bieber, seen here on Wednesday, may have once again come under suspicion for using drugs . The New York Post reported that police detected 'a strong odor of pot' and sent drug sniffing-dogs on board. According to a TMZ report, the singer was flagged by US. Customs officials upon landing in New Jersey because he has two criminal cases pending in Florida and in his native Canada. News of the latest incident tops off a week full of legal trouble for the Canadian star.On Wednesday, he turned himself into Toronto authorities after being charged with assault. TMZ reported that the fight with the limo driver began when Bieber asked for the music to be turned up. The driver obliged, but not as much as Bieber was hoping, so he apparently stuck his hand through the partition to do it himself. The driver swatted his hand away and then it errupted into a full-on smack fest as Bieber then hit the driver in the head multiple times. He already faces a charge of driving under the influence after getting caught drag racing in Miami. Bieber has pleaded not guilty to DUI, resisting arrest without violence and driving without a valid license in the Miami case. A preliminary toxicology report released Thursday showed that he tested positive for marijuana and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. Bieber told police after the arrest that he had been smoking marijuana and had taken a prescription drug, saying that his mother gave him the medication. Being held: The private plane that allegedly brought Bieber, his father, and their entourage to New Jersey's Teterboro airport was searched by authorities after landing . Role model: Bieber's father, Jeremy, is said to be going to watch the Super Bowl with his music star son this weekend . Bad week: Bieber was arrested for DUI in Miami last Thursday (pictured) and turned himself in on assault charges in Canada on Wednesday, but also has outstanding vandalism charges against him in California . His father was with him while they were in Florida and was at his side in Canada on Wednesday. Late Thursday, Bieber posted a photo of his father, Jeremy, with a praise-filled caption. 'I have the greatest Dad in the world. He's taught me how to love, learn, and stay true to myself. I will forever be grateful because he was my superehero,' he wrote on his Instagram photo. In California, the singer remains under investigation for an egg-tossing incident that left his neighbor's house with thousands of dollars in damage. If Bieber is charged in that case, a California judge may look at him more harshly in light of the Florida and Toronto cases, said Stan Goldman, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles. Bieber has not addressed the vandalism claim in California, and his attorney Howard Weitzman has said the singer's legal team believes their client is innocent in the Toronto case. His court date for the Miami DUI incident has been set to March 3, two days after he turns 20. A Miami-Dade County judge set trial for the three misdemeanors; driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an invalid license. Bieber's lawyers have already filed a written plea of not guilty and initial trial dates are often delayed. Beliebers: After word spread of the star's landing, fans gathered outside the gates of the private airport hoping for a glance of the troubled star .","Justin Bieber took a private jet from Canada to Teterboro, New York City .

"By . Paul Bentley . Retiring: Colin Skipp, who plays Tony Archer, with Patricia Gallimore as Pat Archer in 1999 . He is the longest serving soap star in Britain, entertaining listeners with exploits as Tony Archer for more than four decades. So Archers fans will be saddened to learn Colin Skipp is finally hanging up his muddy wellies. The actor, who started on the radio show in 1967, revealed yesterday that he is retiring to spend more time with his family after a series of heart attacks. 'I'm sorry to be leaving The Archers after more than 40 happy years in the programme. But sadly ill health has made it extremely difficult for me to continue playing Tony,' he said. Mr Skipp has featured in many of the most memorable storylines in The Archers. In the early days, his character was a mischievous lad, but he was tamed after marrying his wife Pat. The relationship became difficult in the 1980s when she embraced politics and became involved in the women's movement but converting Bridge Farm to organic production unified them and saved the marriage. Tony also faced tragedy, having to come to terms with his son John's death in a tractor accident in 1998, and health problems of his own, suffering a heart attack at 60. While Mr Skipp is retiring, his character will remain, played by David Troughton, who has appeared in Doctor Who and Outnumbered. Mr Skipp added: 'While at 60 years of age, Tony quickly recovered from his heart attack, I had more problems at 74 coping with several real-life heart attacks, resulting in major heart surgery. 'I shall miss my trips to Ambridge, working with a superb cast, directors, everyone in the office and studio - and my lovely radio family, Pat, Louiza and Tom. 'However, I'm looking forward to spending time with my own wife, daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter. I send best wishes to David Troughton, the new Tony, and hope the part will give him as much pleasure as it gave me.' Mr Troughton, who starts on January 7, is coincidentally a cousin of Judy Bennett, who plays Tony Archer's cousin Shula Hebden Lloyd in the show. He said: 'This came totally out of the blue but I was extremely pleased and privileged to be asked to take over such an important part in the longest running series in the world. Long running: The Archers' cast celebrate their 50th anniversary . 'I wish Colin all the best in his retirement and I'll do my very best to fill his muddy wellington boots.' Mr Skipp is the longest serving soap actor in Britain, even though Barbara Knox first appeared as Rita Tanner in Coronation Street three years before he joined The Archers. She however, has not featured on her show continuously. Sean O'Connor, editor of the Radio 4 series, said: 'We're so sorry to say goodbye to Colin Skipp, who has been at the core of The Archers family for so many years. He has created a vibrant, warm and iconic character. He'll be hugely missed by everybody working on the programme and, I'm sure, by listeners too. 'However, we're thrilled to welcome David Troughton to fill Colin's Wellies and very excited to see where he and the writers will take Tony and the Bridge Farm Archers in the future.'","The actor, who started on the radio show in 1967, is retiring .

He was arrested in Oxford in November 2009 after fleeing Washington DC when the US government began seeking an indictment against him for ‘wire fraud and money laundering’. US Courts have also ordered Halligen to pay about £4 million to other former business partners who claim he fleeced them. Halligen had been fighting extradition since his arrest.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Just a fortnight after the Loch Ness Monster was 'spotted' on Apple Maps, an 'unusual' sonar image appears to have captured the elusive creature too. The screenshot tracked movement of a large object, deep below the surface, close to Urquhart Castle in Inverness. Both reports have reignited interest in the quest for the legendary monster, which has been the subject of various hoaxes and myths over the past 80 years. Just a fortnight after alleged sightings of the Loch Ness monster were spotted on Apple Maps, an 'unusual' sonar image, pictured, has been recorded that appears to show the elusive creature. The screen shot captured movement of the large object, deep below the surface close to Urquhart Castle in Inverness . The Loch Ness Monster has been the subject of many sightings in the Scottish Highlands. Some experts believe the beast represents a line of long-surviving plesiosaurs, a type of carnivorous aquatic reptile from millions of years ago. Nessie is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, though its description varies from one account to the next. There have been hundreds of supposed sightings over the years. Most, however, have been dismissed as hoax or fantasy. One of the most accepted explanations is that the monster is in fact a giant sturgeon, which can grow up to 12 feet long. Others include eels, bird wakes, seals, trees, logs, submarines, dogs with sticks - and even an elephant. The image was recorded by sonar equipment on board the flagship vessel of Inverness-based Jacobite Cruises. Skipper John Askew said: ‘This image certainly grabbed our attention. 'The Jacobite Queen spends every day sailing up and down the loch with the sonar on, and this reading is the most unusual we have seen for quite some time. 'It's impossible to tell what we've picked up here, but along with those satellite images, you can't help feeling that reports of the Loch Ness Monster's demise may be premature. ‘Nessie captures the imagination of people all over the world and, if anything, the speculation around lack of recent sightings has increased that interest.' Last October, the man who took a picture billed as ‘the best ever taken of the Loch Ness monster’ admitted it was a fake. George Edwards, 61, who also operates a cruise boat on the loch, insisted the picture, published worldwide in August 2012 had been ‘just a bit of fun’. The alleged shots of the monster had, in fact, been a fibre glass hump. This new sonar image was revealed just weeks after satellite images appeared to show a mystery object in the loch. A shadowy form, pictured, measuring around 100ft long (30 metres) with two giant flippers was photographed by a satellite and spotted on the Apple Maps app . The original so-called Surgeon's Photograph, taken by Dr Robert Kenneth Wilson and published in the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934, supposedly showed the monster's head and neck, but was also later proved to be a hoax . Saint Columba was an Irish abbot and missionary who is credited with spreading Christianity in Scotland. According to legend, he travelled to Scotland in 563AD and performed miracles while converting Picts. His most famous miracle is his encounter with the Loch Ness monster. He is said to have banished the ferocious 'water beast' to the depths of the River Ness. The monster is meant to have killed a Pict and attacked his disciple. Saint Columba  was an active missionary who founded several churches. The original so-called Surgeon's Photograph, taken by Dr Robert Kenneth Wilson and published in the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934, supposedly showed the monster's head and neck, but was also later proved to be a hoax. This new sonar image has been revealed just weeks after satellite images attracted global attention. The photographs showed an enormous reptilian 'creature' lurking beneath the loch's waters. A shadowy form measuring around 100ft long (30 metres) with two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by a satellite and spotted on the Apple Maps app. The image was studied for six months . by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded . it was ‘likely’ to be the elusive beast. This new 'sighting' will cause fresh excitement among frustrated Nessie hunters, following more than a year without a glimpse of the monster. The image was recorded by sonar equipment on board the flagship vessel of Inverness-based Jacobite Cruises as it sailed on Loch Ness, pictured . Last October, the man who took a picture billed as 'the best ever taken of the Loch Ness monster' admitted it was a fake. George Edwards, 61, insisted the image, pictured, published worldwide in August 2012 had been 'just a bit of fun'. The alleged shots of the monster had, in fact, been a fibre glass hump . Every year Jacobite Cruises' fleet carries more than 100,000 passengers on Loch Ness, with the possibility of spotting Nessie adding extra excitement to their enjoyment of the world-famous destination's scenery and atmosphere. The Jacobite Queen's sister vessels, the Jacobite Legend and Jacobite Warrior, are also equipped with sonar equipment, providing live images from the depths of the loch. Jacobite Cruises recently launched the tongue-in-cheek NessieToVote campaign to secure a vote for Nessie in the Scottish independence referendum. These new claims also suggest Nessie has returned from his trip to Australia. Last November, residents of Magnetic Island - located off the Queensland coastal city of Townsville - claimed to have spotted a Nessie-style creature swimming in Picnic Bay. The Loch Ness Monster has been a subject of mass intrigue and debate since it came to . the world's attention in 1934. Scientists have widely written off the idea as a modern-day myth, with continued sightings claimed to be set ups and wishful thinking. But it has remained a contested phenomenon for almost 80 years. Perhaps the most famous picture (pictured right) of . Nessie was taken by Dr Robert Kenneth Wilson, a London gynaecologist. It . was published in the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934. The picture showed what looked like a long neck and head rising from the water. However, . it turned out to be a toy submarine bought from Woolworths with a head . and neck made of wood in an elabourate hoax by big-game hunter Marmaduke . Wetherell in an act of revenge on the newspaper that had ridiculed him . over his hapless search for the beast. The . earliest report of a monster in the vicinity of Loch Ness appears in . the Life of St Columba by Adomnán, written in the 7th century. St . Columba, an Irish monk, had sent a disciple into the loch to prove . there was nothing there. But the monster rose and chased the man . snapping at his heels. But it fled in terror 'as if pulled back by ropes' when St Columba made the sign of the cross and commanded: 'Go no further. Do not touch the man. Go back at once.' Marmaduke Wetherell, seated, is pictured studying a chart of the Loch Ness in a search for the Loch Ness Monster. He was said to have faked the most famous picture in revenge for bad publicity . In November 1933, Hugh Gray was the first to picture something splashing in the water. Four . stumpy-looking objects on the bottom of the creature's body appeared to . look like appendages, such as flippers. It was later suggested the . creature was a dog, possibly holding a stick. In 1938, G. E. Taylor, a South African tourist, filmed something in the loch for three minutes on 16mm colour film. His picture was declared 'positive evidence' by a famous biologist and cryptozoologist. In 1960, aeronautical engineer Tim Dinsdale filmed a hump crossing the water leaving a powerful wake. Dinsdale allegedly spotted the animal on . his last day hunting for it, and described the object as reddish with a . blotch on its side. In May 2007, Gordon Holmes, a . 55-year-old lab technician, captured video of what he said was 'this jet . black thing, about 45ft long, moving fairly fast in the water'. The film, though, has been cast into . doubt.  Holmes has been criticised for claiming the existence of . fairies. Another expert later claimed the film actually shows otters . swimming in the loch. In February 2012, a sonar image of a . large mystery object deep below the surface of Loch Ness netted boat . skipper Marcus Atkinson the Best Nessie Sighting of The Year Award - the . first time in several years it has been presented by bookmaker William . Hill. The sonar picture, that shows a large . unidentified living object deep underwater, was recorded by Loch Ness . boat skipper Marcus Atkinson.

"By . Jill Reilly . A suicidal Disneyland Paris worker poured petrol over himself and had to be restrained from setting himself alight by a colleague after he was summoned to a meeting with the theme park bosses. The grim revelation adds to mounting speculation about working conditions at the most visited tourist site in Europe which had already seen two employee suicides in the past few years. 'He emptied a barrel of petrol over his head and took a lighter to set fire...but a  colleague jumped on him at the last moment, preventing him from committing the irreparable,' said Patrick Maldidier, a representative of the National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions. Grim: A suicidal Disneyland Paris worker poured petrol over himself and had to be restrained from setting himself alight by a colleague after he was summoned to a meeting with bosses . In a letter to theme park officials, Unsa warned of a 'deterioration of the social climate which is noticed by . us as well as the employees within the company,' reported The Independent. It added: 'We believe that this . deterioration is related to changes in working conditions. This . deterioration of the social climate is also accentuated by an absence of . dialogue and a sharp increase in disciplinary sanctions.' The union said it has opened its own . investigation 'to understand the reasons' for the suicide attempt, and . said they are planning to file a complaint against Disneyland Paris. A spokesman for Disney said: 'Several investigations are being conducted by independent experts to understand  this incident. The employee, has received counselling and is now back at work but to respect his privacy, no further details can be shared.' Speculation: The grim revelation adds to mounting speculation about working conditions at the most visited tourist site in Europe which had already seen two employee suicides in the past few years . A spokesman for Disneyland Paris said the park was saddened' by the actions of the employee, which took place on 18 October this year. The man whose identity has not been revealed, is being closely monitored. But Unsa has opened its own investigation and says they are planning to file a complaint against Disneyland Paris. The French offering is not wholly-owned by the Walt Disney Company, unlike the US ventures. Disney has a 39.8 per cent stake in it with 50.2 per cent floated on the stock exchange in Paris. Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed owns 10 per cent - he saved Disneyland Paris from bankruptcy by injecting $350m into its parent company Euro Disney in 1994. The company said: 'Disneyland Paris has maintained its employment levels since 2009 while many employers have significantly reduced their workforces due to the difficult economic climate; additionally the Company has delivered four salary plans in four years, with an average increase of 10 per cent between 2008 and 2012.' In 2010 two chefs who worked at the park took their own lives. The first man threw himself under a train - . his death came a day after another worker threatened to kill himself at . the attraction after it was announced he was to be dismissed. The second was a man who was due to start back at work after a prolonged period of sick leave, but a trade union representing him said he described the working conditions at the popular theme park as 'humiliating'. A Disney staff and management health committee investigation found no evidence of work harassment after the first suicide, and Disneyland Paris directors denied that the second suicide was work-related. Earlier this month it was revealed that Disneyland Paris attracted a million fewer visitors this year after a record 2012. Visitorship fell to 14.9 million for the financial year ending September, compared to 16 million in 2012, the theme park's operator Euro Disney said. Bad press: Last moth Iban, a five-year-old boy from Montpellier, in the south of France, was left ¿fighting for his life¿ after falling off the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction . The slump was mostly due to a drop in French visitors -- who fell by 600,000. The theme park also recorded fewer Spanish and Italian visitors, although more British and Germans turned up. Overall sales slipped 1.1 percent to 1.31 billion euros ($1.75 billion) for the year. The revelation is the latest bit of bad news for Disneyland Paris - it has been the scene of a number of accidents in recent years. Last moth Iban, a five-year-old boy from Montpellier, in the south of France, was left ‘fighting for his life’ after falling off the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction. It led to Julien Kaufman, vice president of the EuroDisney group which runs the amusement park, saying everything would be done to ‘work out what happened.’ Disneyland Paris attracted 16 million visitors last year — twice the number who went up the Eiffel Tower - but it has failed to make profits since it opened 20 years ago. Britons are the biggest foreign visitor group to Paris, and thousands of them head to Disneyland every week. Construction started on the 5,000-acre site in 1988 and it opened to the public in 1992, well over budget. Visitor numbers were lower than hoped for and the hotels fell below their targets. Two years after it opened, headlines asked if it was heading for bankruptcy. But in 1994, banks agreed to restructure the project's debts. By the end of 1994, the park had turned a corner. New rides such as Space Mountain were opened in 1995 and a second park - the Walt Disney Studios Park - opened to mark its 10th birthday. Now it has celebrated its 20th anniversary. However, it was revealed in April 2012 that the park owed a staggering £1.6billion - and it would take at least 12 years to pay off the debt. In September a 5,000-strong petition was launched against the park, claiming it was 'falling apart', amid complaints about reheated food, broken rides and cancelled stage shows. Disney did not comment.","Union: 'He emptied a barrel of petrol over his head and took a lighter to set fire...but a  colleague jumped on him at the last moment'

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . There is little doubt that the watching world will be in awe when England take to the field against Italy in Manaus in less than two weeks. The Amazon Arena is an architectural gem in the modern style of football stadia, a design which creates the illusion that an elegant spaceship has landed in the jungle town. Rainwater is collected in the roof to irrigate the pitch; the over- arching structure is specially built to ventilate the crowd. The 44,500, all-seater stadium will be a fitting venue for Wayne Rooney, Andrea Pirlo, Steven Gerrard and Mario Balotelli and for three further World Cup fixtures. Carnival or chaos? Social unrest could rear it's head should Brazilians become unsettled during the World Cup . White Elephant: The Amazon Arena in Manaus, home of England v Italy, could be redundant after World Cup . And then it will cease to have a sensible purpose. Three workers died constructing a stadium that is essentially a vanity project for local politicians and which cost £171milion - some £40m over budget. When England depart and the World Cup circus moves on, the  stadium will be taken over by local club side Nacional. Their average attendance is 1,963. Those facts explain the social uprising that threatens to envelop Brazil this month. For the Brazil 2014 organising committee and the Brazilian government, with a little help from FIFA, have done something truly extraordinary: they have turned a nation more obsessed with its national team than any other into opponents of the World Cup. The most recent opinion poll has 48 per cent of Brazilians supportive of the tournament, down from 78 per cent in 2008. Heroes and Villains: 'Ronaldo traitor. You are who deserves a beating'. Vociferous: Masked demonstrators burn a Brazilian national flag during a protest against the tournament . Vociferous: (Top left) 'We want schools, metros, trains buses, ferries and hospitals at FIFA quality'. ‘Never before has the World Cup incited these feelings of hatred among Brazilians,’ said Ugo  Giorgetti, a prominent Brazilian film-maker and football fan. He seems to speak for many, judging by huge street protests that accompanied last year’s Confederations Cup - demonstrations initially provoked by a hike in bus fares. Romário, star of Brazil’s 1994 World Cup-winning team and now a socialist politician in the Chambers of Deputies, the lower house in Congress, calls the tournament ‘the biggest heist in the history of Brazil’. It is not just the delays, the cost and the futility of the stadia that is so abhorrent this time. We are used to obsolete arenas being abandoned after tournaments. Probe some of the extravagance a little more closely and the reason for the deep anger on the streets becomes evident. The National Stadium in Brasilia cost £375m to build, well over budget and making the Manaus project seem positively frugal. A 141-page report by the city’s auditors has found ‘grave irregularities’ in the budget, which appears to indicate over-pricing of some materials. ‘The country of football is reacting to the waste, the unfinished infrastructure projects, the allegations of corruption, the poor quality of schools and hospitals, the poor use of resources,’ said Mailson da Nóbrega, a former finance minister of Brazil. Pricey: Police protect the £375million National Stadium in Brasilia . Some FIFA officials know the era of the major tournament has become corrupted to the point at which it is in danger of becoming obsolete, swept away like a tired old regime in a storm of social protest. But Sepp Blatter, standing again for the presidency three years after he promised to retire following this term, does not appear to be among that group. And as FIFA has settled on Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 for the next tournaments, we need not expect reform any time soon. There is a contradiction within all of this, of course. Many professional observers of Brazil are convinced that once the tournament begins, social tensions will ease and a nation that is so obsessed with its team will largely rally round. Even the most committed opponent of the World Cup will find it hard to hold back the wave of enthusiasm that surrounds a successful Brazil side. However, this is based on the assumption that Neymar, David Luiz, Julio Cesar and their team-mates perform. Most agree that a disappointing performance will re-ignite the fires of social protest. The World Cup may yet reach a happy conclusion. There will doubtless be plenty to admire in Brazil, on and off the pitch, although most of it will be in spite of, rather than because of, the organisers’ best efforts. But when a country that is popularly defined by carnival and football can find little to celebrate in hosting the World Cup, even the most hardened FIFA executives must recognise that, without change, this celebration of football will one day cease to have a meaningful  purpose. Big ask: Brazil's poster boy Neymar is under pressure to deliver the trophy that will unite the country . Figurehead: FIFA President Sepp Blatter is to stand for re-election despite insisting that he wouldn't .","Protests and social unrest in Brazil set to threaten the World Cup .

"By . Matt Roper . Doctors in Brazil accidentally tore the head off a baby they were struggling to deliver, it was reported today. The horrific incident occurred after the child became stuck as it was being born in Aracaju, northeastern Brazil. The baby boy's headless body remained inside the mother and had to be removed by Caesarian. Tragic: The 22-year-old mother, who has three other children, was rushed for an emergency Caesarian where, according to the woman, the headless body of the baby was removed (file pic) A team of five doctors at the Santa Isabel maternity hospital had spent hours trying to deliver the baby in the early hours of Tuesday. The 22-year-old mother, who has three other children, told her family she knew something was wrong when she heard something 'crack'. Gilmara Azevedo dos Santos, the woman's cousin, told Brazil's Globo G1 website: 'She went through a lot of suffering, it was hours and hours and a lot of pain and discomfort, with doctors pushing on her stomach, trying everything to make the baby come out. 'Then at one point, she heard a loud noise and one of the doctors said, 'Marcos, are you crazy?' He said the mother asked what was happening but didn't get an answer. She was rushed for an emergency Caesarian where, according to the woman, the headless body of the baby was removed. Ms Santos added: 'My cousin is totally devastated, the whole family is in shock. She is still in so much pain, as after the head had been pulled off they tried to get the body out by cutting her. In the end they had to open up her body to take out her son's dead body.' The hospital's clinic director Debora Leite today said that a committee of professionals had been set up to investigate the baby's death. The family confirmed they intend to sue for medical negligence.","A team of five doctors at the Santa Isabel maternity hospital had spent hours trying to deliver the baby .

"By . Tara Brady . Detectives are hoping a good Samaritan who let two convicted paedophiles stay in his home can shed light on where the pair were when Madeleine McCann vanished. Friends Charles O'Neill, 50, and William Lauchlan, 36, from Largs near Glasgow, in Scotland, were questioned two years ago in connection with Madeleine's disappearance. They were jailed for life in 2010 for abducting a 15-year-old and murdering a mother who had threatened to expose their abuse of boys. Scroll down for video . Charles O'Neill (left) and William Lauchlan were jailed for life for murdering a mum and carrying out sex attacks on children . They were interviewed in prison by detectives after inquiries revealed they had been touring Spain, and possibly Portugal, on false passports when Madeleine disappeared in May 2007. Prison visitor Ewan Wilson offered the pair a home in Falkirk, Scotland. They first met when Mr Wilson visited the duo in prison while they were serving time for indecent assaults on boys. Mr Wilson confirmed to The Sun he had spoken to the police. Prime suspect: These e-fits are of the man seen carrying a child 500 yards from the McCanns' holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal . Breakthrough? Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann received 150 calls from Holland after a TV broadcast there last night . In 2006, locals learnt the two paedophiles were living at Mr Wilson's home which led to vigilantes throwing bricks and eggs at the house. Charles O'Neill and William Lauchlan were jailed for life for murdering Allison McGarrigle (pictured) The pair fled to Spain and started up a cleaning business called Rainbow Cleaning Services. At the same time a seven-year-old boy called Teremi Vargas disappeared in Gran Canaria where the pair were staying. The boy has never been found. Lauchlan and O’Neill are known to have toured extensively and some reports suggested they were in the Algarve at the time Madeleine disappeared. They returned to the UK and began living in Blackpool in November 2007. As convicted sex offenders they were required to report to police but they failed to declare they had bought a van. In 2008 they were charged with the murder of a Allison McGarrigle who lived with the pair. She had threatened to expose their abuse to police. At the High Court in 2010, the duo were convicted of strangling her, putting her body in a wheelie bin and dumping it at sea by the High Court in Glasgow in 2010. The pair were also found guilty of a series of offences which included grooming a six-year-old boy and attacking 15-year-old in Benidorm in 2004. Dutch appeal: Chief Inspector Andy Redwood calls on Dutch viewers to report themselves if they were in the area at the time of the girl's disappearance in 2007, during a broadcast of Opsporing Verzocht on Dutch television . O'Neill was jailed for 30 years while Lauchlan was sentenced for 26 years. Detectives are examining the movements of a number of paedophiles – British and mainland European –  who are thought to have been in Portugal when Madeleine vanished. Officers are analysing mobile phone data of people in Praia da Luz on the day Maddie went missing, in bid to build a case against child sex offenders who feature in the inquiry. They are also looking at credit card and bank transactions of these potential suspects to see if it proves where they were around the time she went missing. O'Neill and Lauchlan are believed to be among a group of potential suspects or people of interest and police are following up a many lines of inquiry. Last week, police issued new e-fit images of two men which resemble the pair. Madeleine disappeared from her room at the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007. Response: After the couple's appeal on BBC Crimewatch(pictured), a number of callers gave names for the man police believe snatched Madeleine . Search: Madeleine's mother said she was 'genuinely hopeful' of a breakthrough . New timeline: The Crimewatch special revealed that police were now looking at Madeleine's abduction as being at 10pm and not 9.15pm . Mother Kate McCann and her husband Gerry had been dining with friends less than 100 yards away in a tapas restaurant on the Mark Warner complex. Detectives investigating the child's disappearance have received 1,400 new leads since a new appeal on BBC's Crimewatch aired last week. Her parents said they are 'genuinely hopefully' that police can make progress in the investigation after the special broadcast. With 6.7million viewers, the appeal attracted the biggest Crimewatch audience on record – almost double the average of 3.9 million. A Metropolitan Police spokesman declined to comment this morning saying: 'We will not be giving a running commentary.'","Charles O'Neill and William Lauchlan questioned two years ago in connection with Madeleine McCann's disappearance .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . For cyclists wanting to maintain their hair, an inflatable collar might be quite appealing. But one company claim their airbag helmet is not only a worthwhile fashion accessory - it's also considerably safer than a regular bike helmet. In Hövding's new video, they outline just why you should stump up the cash for their fancy new collar and throw your old rigid head protector in the bin. Scroll down for video . Hövding's collar (left) inflates when it detects unnatural movement (right), protecting your head as you fall to the ground in an accident (or just being a nuisance when you brake too quickly) The video shows a number of studies into Hövding's rather unusual helmet. The Swedish makers say that many modern bike helmets only just comply with European regulations. But their helmet apparently performed considerably better in testing, making it three times safer than traditional helmets. They go on to state that, using their inflatable helmet, the risk of fatal head injuries resulting from accidents can be reduced to almost zero. Their helmet is so much better, they say, that if the tests were redone with Hövding as the standard then all other bike helmets would be obsolete. One of the graphs in the video shows the chances of serious injury occurring when wearing the inflatable helmet (left) compared to a traditional helmet (right) in an accident . The airbag, designed like a hood, is made of nylon fabric. With a traditional cycle helmet in a serious accident, the likelihood of serious head injury is approximately 90% according to Hövding. The risk of a fatal injury can even be as high as 30%. The use of an airbag cycle helmet in the same accident dramatically reduces the risk of injury. The risk of serious head injury is then only 2% and the risk of a fatal injury almost non-existent. This means that when it scrapes across the ground it won’t rip. It also covers a larger area of the head than a regular bike helmet, providing more protection. Pressure within the helmet stays constant for a few seconds, so it can withstand multiple impacts. It is inflated by helium that is held in a holder in the back of the collar. One obstacle to this being the gold standard in head protection might be the price, however. At £299 ($500) it's not exactly cheap and, after it has been inflated once, you can't use it again. But it might be a small price to pay for cyclists to keep themselves safe on the roads. Or, at the very least, it'll provide some amusement for bystanders if it inflates accidentally while you're cycling along. The helmets are stored inside 'stylish' scarves that come in a variety of colours and patterns.

"By . Phil Duncan . Follow @@PhilDuncanF1 . Mercedes have trialled a modified exhaust system in a bid to raise the sound levels of Formula One. The noise produced by the new 1.6-litre turbo engines has come under scrutiny from most corners of the sport this season with a working group subsequently tasked to find a solution. Mercedes, who supply engines to four teams on the grid, have led the development process in cooperation with the FIA and under Bernie Ecclestone's insistence. Picture that: The tail pipe on the back of Nico Rosberg's Mercedes has been widened to improve the noise . On track: Rosberg, who now trails Lewis Hamilton in the world championship, exits the pits on Wednesday . New look: The tail pipe has been dramatically widened since Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix . The 'trumpet' design was unveiled for the first time on the back of Nico Rosberg's W05 hybrid during Wednesday's test at the Circuit de Catalunya. The tail pipe, which has been widened in order to create more volume, will then be evaluated by the FIA, who are taking measurements to assess its impact. Speaking to Spotrtsmail last week, Rosberg, who finished second in Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, said: 'Mercedes have done lots of work on trying to make the cars louder and have a greater engine noise. They have come up with good solutions, we have tested them in the factory and they work, so now we will test them on the track next week. Admission: Rosberg, pictured testing on Wednesday, admits the cars are not loud enough for the sport's fans . 'Then it is a matter for the FIA to get all the teams to agree and try and get the things on the cars.' Rosberg, three points adrift of Lewis Hamilton in the championship after the Briton's win in Spain,  was hesitant to put a timescale on when the louder engines would be introduced at a grand prix weekend, and warned that all of the teams would have to reach an agreement before they were ratified. 'I understand the cars are not loud enough for the fans and that's part of the sport's attraction,' added Rosberg. 'It depends on the teams agreeing so it is going to take a bit of time.' Sauber's Giedo van der Garde ran in Tuesday's session, with Esteban Gutierrez replacing him on Wednesday but the former Caterham driver was on the pit-wall and also did not think Rosberg's car sounded much different to other runners. 'You hear a bit more sound, but it was not huge,' he told Sky Sports News. 'Everyone is complaining about the sound but it is how it is. The cars go fast in a straight line and I quite like it. You get the whistle from a turbo and I'm quite pleased by it. For me it is fine.'","Nico Rosberg tested the modified exhaust system in Spain on Wednesday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A father and son have been found living in the jungle of Vietnam four decades after they went missing during the country's war with the U.S. Ho Van Thanh and his son Ho Van Lang apparently fled their home village 40 years ago after a bomb killed three members of their family.

Found: Ho Van Lang, 41, has been living in the jungle of Vietnam since he was two years old . Family: Ho Van Lang, left, and Ho Van Thanh, right, moved to the jungle when their relatives were killed by a mine . Yesterday authorities confirmed that the men were Thanh, 82, and 41-year-old Lang. The older man once lived a normal life with his family in the hamlet of Tra Kem around the time of the Vietnam War. But one day his wife and two of his sons were killed by a mine explosion, putting him in a state of shock. He took his two-year-old son and fled into the jungle, thereafter never having any contact with anyone else.

"By . Corey Charlton . Tinder chief executive Sean Rad is at the centre of new revelations in the company's sexual harassment case for allegedly sending a text message describing his boss as a penis. A lawsuit filed by former executive Whitney Wolfe, 24, claimed she was forced from the company and sexually harassed after her relationship with co-founder and chief marketing officer Justin Mateen fell apart. However, Rad's text message is one of a number of incidents the lawsuit claims were an example of the 'misogynist, alpha-male stereotype too often associated with technology startups'. Tinder chief executive and co-founder Sean Rad, left, is alleged to have sent a message describing his boss Barry Diller as a penis, in what the lawsuit cited as an example of the alpha-male stereotype at the company . Rad is said to have sent the message about IAC/InterActiveCorp chairman Barry Diller during a . meeting with executives from the IAC company which owns Tinder. The NYPost reported Rad texted Miss Wolfe a photo of a piece of paper with Diller's name written across the top of the page, followed by the letters 'AKA' underneath it. Below this were Diller's initials 'BD', drawn in the shape of a penis. It was reported Rad would be safe within the company, despite his role in the company's current controversy. When approached for comment, a Tinder spokesman sent MailOnline a statement in which Rad told internal staff he wish he had 'done more in terms of managing what was clearly a complex situation'. It read: 'The communications between Justin and Whitney that have come to my attention through this process are just unacceptable. 'However, as many of you know, Whitney’s legal complaint is full of factual inaccuracies and omissions. We did not discriminate against Whitney because of her age or gender, and her complaint paints an inaccurate picture of my actions and what went on here.' Rad is named in Miss Wolfe's lawsuit as standing by and doing nothing while she was being forced out. She claims she was called a w**** by Mateen in front of Rad and that she was stripped of her co-founder title because Mateen told her that having a '24-year-old girl' co-founder made the company 'seem like a joke.' The lawsuit claims Mateen and Rad subjected her to a 'barrage of horrendously sexist, racist and otherwise inappropriate comments, emails and text messages'. The suit says that Wolfe, centre, was forced out of the company after her affair with Mateen, left, soured and she complained to Rad, right, who did nothing . According to the suit, Miss Wolfe was a 'driving force behind Tinder from the very beginning...even before there was a Tinder, Wolfe was a key player on the team that produced the wildly successful dating app'. The suit credits her with suggesting the name - 'because tinder helps to light a flame, which had obvious dating analogues'. She first crossed paths with Mateen in September 2012 when Rad offered his long-term friend a two months contract with the start-up. In November 2012, Miss Wolfe was officially recognised as a co-founder and that same month, she alleges, 'Mr Mateen began pursuing a romantic relationship' with her', though the couple didn't start dating until the following February. However, as the company's fortunes boomed Mateen and Miss Wolfe's relationship was floundering. She alleges that he grew 'verbally controlling and abusive', that he accused her of 'destroying his power at the company' by virtue of the fact that they had a similar title - she as VP (vice president) of marketing and co-founder, he as CMO (chief marketing officer) and co-founder.","Sexual harassment lawsuit from former executive Whitney Wolfe claims Tinder CEO Sean Rad sent a text describing his boss as a penis .

"By . Julian Robinson . A murderer shows he has no shame as he raises his middle finger - on the day he admitted brutally stabbing his ex-girlfriend to death. Asher Maslin, 22, made the vulgar gesture as he was being driven away to life in jail after pleading guilty to killing hairdresser Hollie Gazzard while she was working. Maslin knifed the 20-year-old 14 times in front of horrified colleagues as she worked at Fringe Benefits and La Bella Beauty salon in Gloucester city centre.

Killer: Asher Maslin, pictured left, bought a knife before heading to the salon in Gloucester city centre and carrying out the attack on Hollie Gazzard, pictured right . Former couple: Asher Maslin, pictured  with Hollie Gazzard before the pair split. He has now admitted murder . Police say Maslin purchased a knife . before heading to the salon after the pair had separated. He pleaded . guilty to the killing during a hearing at Bristol Crown Court. Miss Gazzard was nearing the end of her shift when she was brutally set upon. During the . attack in February, and as paramedics and police officers desperately tried to save . the 20-year-old’s life, bystanders were filming on their mobile phones. Police later warned them not to upload the pictures to social media sites. In the run-up to her death, Miss Gazzard had used her Twitter account to hint at her on/off relationship with an ex-boyfriend. One . tweet, written last December, said: “Why are people so selfish?! If a . person isn’t happy within the relationship why try and make them stay?!” Another, a retweet sent just a few weeks before she died, said: 'Sometimes holding on is a sign of weakness.' Following her death, Miss Gazzard’s family said 'the brightest star' in their lives had gone out. A post-mortem examination found she died from multiple stab wounds. Court: Police say Maslin, pictured, purchased a knife . before heading to the salon after the pair had separated. He pleaded . guilty to the killing during a hearing at Bristol Crown Court today . Crime scene: A police cordon is in place outside Fringe Benefits hair dressers, pictured, on Southgate Street, Gloucester, after the attack on the 20-year-old . The . Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has launched an . investigation into Gloucestershire Police’s contact with Miss Gazzard . before her death. Miss . Gazzard’s family - including her father Nick, 49, mother Mandy, 46, and . elder sister Chloe, 23 - sat in the public gallery to see Maslin enter . his plea. Maslin, who wore a black knitted jumper and dark trousers, spoke only to confirm his name and plead guilty. Peter . Blair QC, defending, said the delay in Maslin entering his plea was to . see whether there were any psychiatric issues in the case but the court . heard there were not. He asked that Maslin not be sentenced before June 23. Prosecutor Stephen Mooney did not open the case against Maslin. Judge . Neil Ford QC, the Recorder of Bristol, remanded Maslin into custody and . said he was likely to be sentenced by a High Court judge. Hollie Gazzard's family described her as 'a popular and much-loved young woman' adding that the 'very public nature of her death has affected a great many people across the community' Asher Maslin has pleaded guilty to the murder of Hollie after she was stabbed to death in her own salon . He told Maslin: 'Your sentencing will take place on a date to be fixed in the relative near future. 'You appreciate that the only sentence that can be imposed is one - imprisonment for life. 'It will be for the sentencing judge to determine the minimum term you will serve before you become eligible for parole. 'In the meantime you will be remanded into custody.' Maslin, of Benhall Gardens, Cheltenham, had been due to go on trial at Gloucester Crown Court on July 14. Miss Gazzard’s family did not wish to speak after the hearing. But . Detective Chief Inspector Steve Bean, the senior investigating officer, . said: ‘This was a spiteful and cowardly attack by a self-obsessed . individual who couldn’t handle rejection. 'I think Maslin realised he didn’t have a chance but he pleaded guilty as the evidence was overwhelming.' Shocking: Maslin stabbed his ex-girlfriend 14 times in a 'cowardly' attack in front of her work colleagues . Floral tributes were left outside Fringe Benefits hair dressers in Gloucester after the brutal killing in February . He said Maslin purchased a knife and went to the salon to attack her. 'Maslin, following a domestic split, purchased a knife and went to Hollie’s place of work. They had a row and he stabbed her 14 times,' he said. 'He has shown no remorse, he made a ‘no comment’ interview and has not shown any kind of feeling or emotion. 'There were a couple of previous, fairly minor, domestic incidents, and nothing to indicate what he went on to do.' 'This murder happened in such a public place and those witnesses were severely traumatised by what they saw. 'Giving evidence in court can be a traumatic experience, particularly when they have experienced such a horrific event, so it is a relief they don’t have to recall events in a courtroom.' Miss Gazzard's family paid tribute to the young hairdresser following her death on February 18. 'She was full of life and we are very proud of her. She was at the beginning of her life and to have it taken away in this manner is very hard to bear,' they said. 'The world has lost a treasure, she was so loved by all her family and friends and the brightest star in their lives has now gone out.' Since Miss Gazzard’s death, her family have set up a charitable trust in her name, to sponsor the training of young hairdressers and contribute towards the fight against domestic violence. She started work in the hairdressing industry aged 16 after being offered an apprenticeship on leaving school. In April, hundreds of people took part in a walk from Gloucester to Cheltenham to raise money for the charitable trust.","Asher Maslin has admitted murdering Hollie Gazzard while she was working .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Found: A letter written by Carl Hans Lody (pictured), the first German spy to be captured during the First World War, to his guards at the Tower of London has been found after 100 years . A letter written by the first German spy to be captured during the First World War to the Guards at the Tower of London has been found after 100 years. Carl Hans Lody was shot by firing squad at the Tower in November 1914, after he was found guilty of war treason and sentenced to death. Now, nearly 100 years after the 37-year-old was killed, a letter he wrote to the guards at the Tower, thanking them for the 'courtesy and consideration' shown towards him, has been unearthed. In the letter to the guard's commanding officer, the German Lieutenant wrote: 'I feel it is my duty as a German officer to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the guards and sentries.' Asking for his thanks to be passed on to the men, he added: 'Although they never neglected their duty, they have shown always the utmost courtesy and consideration towards me.' The letter was written the day before Lody's execution on November 6, 1914. It has been stored at the Guards Museum at Wellington Barracks, but has now been uncovered as part of an exhibition at the museum on the First World War, and the role of the Foot Guards during the conflict. Born in Berlin on January 20, 1877, Lody joined the German Navy in 1900 - serving for a year before he was transferred into the First Naval Reserve and then went on to enterthe merchant navy, where he served on English, Norwegian and American ships. In 1904 he graduated as a captain from the Maritime Academy in Geestemünde, but became ill and was never able to take up the post. Instead he changed career and became a tourist guide - making many friends from the United States as a result of his new role. In 1912, Lody married an American woman, and although the marriage did not last he managed to obtain a forged U.S. passport under the name Charles A Inglis - enabling Lody, who spoke English with an American accent, to travel throughout Europe. As war loomed, Lody volunteered as a Sea Lieutenant, and offered to travel to Britain in order to observe and report back on the country's fleet. Gratitude: Nearly 100 years after the 37-year-old was killed, a letter he wrote to the guards at the Tower, thanking them for the 'courtesy and consideration' shown towards him has been unearthed . His request was denied, and in 1914 he requested to be released from the Naval Reserve so he could go back to America. At the outbreak of war, German naval intelligence decided that Lody's command of English and American passport would make him and ideal agent. He was persuaded to travel to England to gather information on the actual losses suffered by the British fleet, Britain's air defences and the activities at Rosyth naval base in Fife, Scotland. 'I feel it is my duty as a German officer to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the guards and sentries' Carl Hans Lody, November 1914 . However, Lody's intelligence gathering training was limited, and his attempts at espionage were somewhat inaccurate and amateurish. Lody, who stayed at a hotel in Fife, sent his first coded report back by telegram transmitted via Sweden. It read: 'Must cancel. Johnson very ill. Lost four days, Shall leave shortly, Charles.' This meant that there . were four ships being repaired at the dock, and that several others were . about to head out to sea. The Germans dispatched the  U-21 submarine to . this area with orders to attack the shipping about to leave. The lead . ship was HMS Pathfinder, a class scout crusier, which became the first . ship ever to be sunk by a torpedo fired from a submarine. But . after this Lody's lack of training started to show, and he began to . make mistakes - putting his address on his letters and writing them in . German, while he also stopped encrypting the contents. His . actions soon alerted the authorities, and although he fled to Killarney . in Ireland he was arrested by police as a suspected spy. Execution: Carl Hans Lody was shot by firing squad at the Tower of London in November 1914, after he was found guilty of war treason and sentenced to death . He was taken to London and detained at Wellington Barracks, before being convicted of espionage following a court martial at the Middlesex Guildhall in Westminster, and sentenced to death. He had denied attempting to convey information calculated to be useful to an enemy through a letter sent from Scotland, and committing war treason by sending a letter to Berlin from Dublin. During the second day of his trial he . admitted that he was a German national and that the American passport . found in his possession was a fake. When the Provost Marshal went to Lody’s cell to collect him for execution, he is  alledged to have said: 'I suppose that you will not care to shake hands with a German Spy?' The Provost Marshal responded: 'No. But I will shake hands with a brave man.' He was executed on a miniature rifle range at the Tower by an eight man firing squad made up of members of the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards. His execution was meant to be a . secret, but it was rumoured that members of the firing squad broke up . the chair Lody was sitting on when executed and sold it in the local . pubs. Artifacts: The bullet that killed Lody during his execution by firing squad on November 6, 1914 . Grateful: A sixpence which Lody gave to a guard looking after him as a tip . John Fraser, a Yeoman Warder at the time of Lody's death said of his execution:'The . escort and the firing party, too, where far from comfortable, and one . could see that the slow march suitable to the occasion was getting badly . on their nerves. They wanted to hurry over it, and get the beastly . business finished. 'But the . prisoner walked steadly,  upright, and yet as easily and unconcerned as . though he was going to a tea-party, instead of to his death. His eyes . were upturned to the gloomy skies, and his nostrils eagerly drank in the . precious air that was soon to be denied them. But his face was quite . calm and composed - almost expressionless. 'Then . came a queer and pathetic little incident. As the party came to the end . of the Verandah, the Chaplain, in his nervousness made to turn left, . which was the wrong way. Instantly Lody took a quick step forward, . caught the Chaplain by the right arm and with a polite and kindly smile, . gently guided him to the right - the correct way. 'A . few minutres later the procession disappeared through the doorway to . the sinister shed, and shortly after there came the muffled sound of a . single volley. Carl Lody had paid! 'When I think of Karl Lody a phrase always slips into my head - just three little words: A gentleman unafraid!' Lody was first buried in the Tower of London and later disinterred and transferred to the East London Cemetery in Plaistow then finally to Highgate Cemetery, north London. http://www.theguardsmuseum.com/ . The Tower of London's White Tower . Despite its bloody reputation, few executions actually took place inside the Tower of London, with many prisoners executed publicly at other sites in London, including nearby Tower Hill. Private executions were reserved for only the most sensitive and high profile cases, such as the palace's most famous execution - the beheading of Anne Boleyn, King Henry VIII's second wife, who was convicted of infedility and incest and beheaded by a French swordsman near Tower Green in May 1536. In total six people were executed at the Tower during the Tudor period - Countess of Salisbury Margaret Plantagenet Pole, Henry VIII's fifth wife Catherine Howard and her lady-in-waiting Lady Jane Rochford, Lady Jane Grey - who was named Queen following the death of Edward VI, and Robert Devereaux, the Earl of Essex, who became the last person to be officially beheaded at the Tower in 1601, under Queen Elizabeth 1. All six are buried inside the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula, within the Tower. On July 18, 1743 three men from the Black Watch regiment were shot at the Tower on charges of mutiny. The Highland regiment had been charged with keeping peace in Scotland, and were assured they were only be asked to serve there. However, as they travelled to London to be inspected by the King they heard rumours that they were to be instead deployed to the Caribbean - leading around 100 men to turn back. They were taken to the Tower and all but three were pardoned. In total 11 men of various nationalities were shot as spies by firing squad at the Tower between 1914 and 1918. During the Second World War the Tower again served as a temporary prison and in August 1941 German Josef Jakobs was the last person to be executed there. He had been caught as he parachuted into England and found guilty of espionage, before being shot by firing squad while seated in a chair in the East Casemates Rifle Range.","German spy Carl Hans Lody was shot by firing squad on November 6, 1914 .

"By . Steve Nolan . New leads: Scotland Yard detectives could travel to Portugal in the coming days to follow up on new leads in the case of missing Madeleine McCann (pictured) Detectives searching for Madeleine McCann could fly to the Portuguese holiday resort where the youngster went missing within days to follow up on new leads. Metropolitan Police officers could potentially interview suspects, search properties and even make arrests in the Algarve where Madeleine disappeared while on a family holiday in 2007. The Crown Prosecution Service has written a Letter of Request to Portuguese judges this week asking for permission to work in the country to gather evidence alongside local police. According to the Daily Mirror, the letter included the names of some of the suspects that police wish to speak to regarding the case and an outline of a number of offences being investigated. Madeleine went missing from an apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby tapas restaurant. The shambolic Portuguese inquiry was shelved in 2008, but Scotland Yard began a Home Office-funded review in 2011 – known as Operation Grange – following the intervention of David Cameron. The Met said earlier this month that it was preparing to swoop on 38 suspects 'scattered across Europe' after announcing a full criminal investigation. Among them are a dozen British nationals who were visiting or living in the Algarve at the time the then three-year-old went missing. Investigators said that they have no prime suspects but said that they had found no evidence that the youngster had been murdered. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the inquiry, said: ‘We continue to believe that there is a possibility that Madeleine is alive.' Crime scene: The Ocean Club Resort in Praia da Luz where Madeleine went missing in 2007 . New hope: Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann welcomed the Met's announcement that it had new leads earlier this month . The Met's announcement came toward the end of a two year £5million review of the case which officers said has created a 'unique picture' of what happened in the Algarve. Hopeful: Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said that police have no evidence that Madeleine was murdered . Mr Redwood said the painstaking review has brought together all the information about Madeleine for the first time. He said: ‘That has given us the ability to see this case with fresh eyes, and through that bring out new – genuinely new – lines of inquiry. ‘I’m hopeful that when we pursue those lines of inquiry, we will be able to bring some sort of resolution. 'Whether we will be able to solve it is a different issue, but I hope we will be able to have the ability to move the investigation on. 'I believe that this is an important moment for Madeleine. It is a great opportunity which we intend to exploit to the full.’ A Met Police spokesman refused to comment on when detectives will be sent to Portugal as part of the investigation and the CPS was unavailable for comment. Prime Minister David Cameron had ordered the review of the case back in 2011.","Detectives said earlier this month that they have 38 suspects across Europe .

"By . Dan Bloom . The nurse whose appearance in BBC reports on the Ethiopian famine sparked Live Aid has revealed she could not get rid of the TV crew fast enough. Dame Claire Bertschinger spoke of her anguish at having to choose who would live and die in the disaster and said she objected to 'ridiculous' questions from reporter Michael Buerk. Although she accepted Mr Buerk and his crew were doing 'what he needed to do', the humanitarian worker said: 'I couldn't get rid of them fast enough'. 'Ridiculous': Dame Claire Bertschinger said she wanted to get rid of the BBC crew which came to interview her during the Ethiopian famine of 1984. She said her thinking was 'I don't want these people around me' Heartbreaking: Michael Buerk's reports from Ethiopia inspired people to give millions of pounds in food aid . Speaking to Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Dame Bertschinger said some of the hardest times in Ethiopia were on 'selection days' when she would have to choose who got fed. 'I can remember one day counting 10 rows of children and in each row there was over 100 children and I had 60 or 70 places,' she said. 'I thought ""how on earth am I going to do this?"" We decided I would go up and down the lines and look at every child and put a little mark on them if I chose them. 'We didn't choose the ones who were the worst because we knew they would die within a few days. I chose the ones with a spark of life in their eyes. 'I was told [the TV crew] were coming and they came in the door and said ""right, let's get some filming, stand over there, let's get some really sick children Claire, would you like to hold that one?"" Horrific: Dame Bertschinger said she would have enough food to feed 50 or 60 people out of 1,000 or more . 'Then [Michael Buerk] started asking me questions. I remember him asking me ""so Claire, what's it feel like choosing those who can live? Does it do anything to you?"" 'Ridiculous. I mean, what do you expect? It breaks my heart. And I just couldn't get rid of them fast enough because I just thought this is ridiculous, I don't want these people around me.' However, she agreed 'absolutely' that Buerk was doing 'what he needed to do' to push the stark details of the famine into the public consciousness. When the first aid plane arrived thanks to the money raised because of the BBC reports, she said: 'It was this massive plane and it landed in a hail of stones and shingles and dust and they opened the back doors and it was just full of food. 'I thought ""wow - we're saved"". It was just amazing.' Blight: There had been famines before, but the scale and horror of that in Ethiopia shocked the world . The horiffic news reports from Ethiopia - still regarded as some of the most powerful ever recorded - inspired a public campaign which culminated in millions of pounds being released through Band Aid's single Do They Know It's Christmas? Buerk went on to become the anchor of the BBC's evening news, while Dame Bertschinger - who said she wanted to be a nurse since she was bandaging her teddies - was honoured by the Queen and is now a lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Her choices on the long-running interview show included a rendition of Rudyard Kipling's poem If and Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini by Bryan Hyland. She replaced the Bible with Buddhist writings, and chose a Swiss Army knife as her one luxury.","Dame Claire Bertschinger featured in emotional BBC reports in 1984 .

Nico Hulkenburg (Force India) Daniel Ricciardo has become the fourth Australian ever to win a Formula One Grand Prix after he drove to victory in Canada on Sunday. Ricciardo, 24, from Perth in Western Australia, took advantage of electrical problems that hindered top-ranked Nico Rosberg and his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, who retired with mechanical failure when vying for the lead of the race. On Sunday Ricciardo said he was in shock over his win. 'This is ridiculous,' he said. 'I think it still seems a bit surreal to be honest, just because it all happened so quickly at the end. I was third for a while and then it all happened in a really exciting fashion.' Scroll down for video . Daniel Ricciardo of Australia and Infiniti Red Bull Racing celebrates his first grand prix victory in the team garage in Canada . Ricciardo, from Perth, started his career in racing at the age of nine, and was a champion in karting up until the age of 16 . The 24-year-old grew up in Perth with his father Joe, who owns an earth-moving business, and his mother Grace . Australian Grand Prix Corporation chief Andrew Westacott said Ricciardo, who drives for Red Bull, had a lot of experience for his age but said his success was impressive. 'Formula One is the pinnacle of motor sport in the world and Daniel is driving for the team that has been world champion for the last four years,' Mr Westacott told MailOnline. 'And his teammate is Sebastian Vettel, four-time world champion, so it doesn’t get better than that.' After the seventh round of Grand Prix in Canada Ricciardo is ranked third in the drivers' standings, behind Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton. 'It’s not surprising that he's [finishing top three] but what's surprising is that seven races in he's ahead of the current world champion Sebastian Vettel,' Mr Westacott said. Last month, Red Bull Formula One boss Christian Horner said the team had not expected Ricciardo to perform so well when they team chose him to replace Australian Mark Webber in 2014. Jubilation: Daniel Ricciardo celebrates after winning the Canadian Grand Prix . Winning moment: The Australian comes home to take the chequered flag in Montreal . 'Daniel has been a real surprise this year,' Mr Horner told Sky Sports F1. 'We knew he was quick, we just didn't realise how quick. And he is so cool as well, he is quick, he’s good looking, he has got everything going for him.' On Sunday, Red Bull designer Adrian Newey said: 'Daniel is an amazing young man. What impresses me most is how calming he is when he comes on the team radio. We were a bit lucky today in truth but we were there and ready.' The win was extra sweet for Ricciardo, who in March had a second place podium finish in Melbourne taken from him because his Red Bull team broke fuel flow regulations. Ricciardo grew up in Perth with his father Joe, who owns an earth-moving business, and his mother Grace. His parents were always very supportive of his passion for racing. Delight: Ricciardo overtook Nico Rosberg with two laps left of an eventful race in Montreal . 1. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) - 140 . 2. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) - 118 . 3. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) - 79 . 4. Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) - 69 . 5. Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) - 60 . He started racing at the age of nine, and was a champion in karting up until the age of 16. His first foray into international motorsport came in 2006, when he won a scholarship into the Formula BMW Asian championship with Eurasia Motorsport. In 2009 he became the British F3 International Series Champion, but Ricciardo's career really started to take off when he was given a spot on Red Bull's junior Formula One racing team Scuderia Toro Rosso in 2011. 'He got his break by getting a drive in the Toro Rosso team and then he learned his craft for a couple of seasons,' Mr Westacott said. He continued driving for Toro Rosso during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. When Mark Webber retired from the higher-budget Red Bull team, Ricciardo took his place.

"By . Lydia Warren . The girlfriend of a Texas man who was aboard the missing Malaysian Airlines plane has revealed how she anxiously waited at their home in China for the flight that never arrived. Sarah Bajc, who is also an American expat, said the desperate wait for information about her long-term boyfriend Philip Wood was 'one of the most painful things I have ever had to go through'. She had sent a car to Beijing Airport to collect Wood, who worked in Beijing for IBM, as he returned from a trip visiting family in Texas. As she waited, she tracked his journey on the airline's website. 'The online site tracker through . Malaysia Airlines said it was just delayed; that it took off on time but . that it hadn't landed,' Bajc, 48, told CBS News. Waiting for news: Sarah Bajc, left, was at home in Beijing when she learned that the plane flying her boyfriend Philip Wood, right, back to her was missing. She can now do nothing but wait for information . 'Then I looked at the online news, and there was . the news that the plane was missing. The lack of consistency of information has been incredibly . frustrating and confusing.' She . persevered and found a press release saying the airport had lost . contact with the plane and that loved ones should call a number, which . she tried 'on and off for several hours'. 'Finally . they contacted me since I was listed as next of kin, and they were able . to tell me nothing other than the fact that they lost contact,' she continued. 'I . queried them about the various news reports that I'd seen online, first . there was a reported landing, then there was a reported wreckage, then . the oil spill and the passports, and they literally cannot confirm any . of it.' But Bajc, who was . hoping to move to Kuala Lumpur with Wood, 50, in the near future as he . relocated for a new assignment with IBM, said she was glad that they did . not respond to these speculations. Family: Wood is pictured with his two sons, Chris and Nick, who said 'odds are' they won't see him again . Sadness: The men said they accepted they might never see Wood again but that they would always hold hope . Heartbroken: Wood's father broke down as he recounted his son's love of travel and 'big heart' 'The rest of the news media and social . media that keep pushing out this false information are really making . this an awful roller coaster for those involved,' she said. But Bajc added that knowing nothing about the flight gave her hope. 'I'm personally not willing to . give up hope that there's a chance we'll find survivors, that we'll find . the plane,' she said. 'There just has to be a chance.' Wood was one of three . Americans who were aboard the Boeing 777 when it lost contact with air . traffic control on its way from Kuala Lumpur to . Beijing with 227 passengers and 12 crew members. It isn't known with . whom the other two Americans, Nicole Meng, 4, and Yan Zhang, 2, were . traveling. The wreckage has . still not been located. Reports on Monday indicated that five passengers . had checked in but never boarded the plane and that several passengers . were using stolen passports. Lost: Philip Wood, from Texas, is among the passengers aboard a Malaysian Airlines plane that vanished . Missed: He was excited about moving to Kuala Lumpur on a new work assignment, relatives said . Malaysia's civil aviation chief said that the search for the Boeing 777 had failed to find anything and that a sighting of a yellow object, which was earlier suspected to have been a life raft, was found to be a false alarm. Woods, who is divorced, has two sons, Chris and Nick, who said they do not know if they'll ever see their father again. 'I'll never really give up hope, but that doesn't mean that I won't accept that he won't come back,' one said, Good Morning America reported. 'We may not ever see him again, and odds are we won't. I'll be able to come to terms with that.' Wood's brothers also revealed their grief over the lack of news - but said prayer was getting them through. One brother, James Wood, told the Associated Press from the Dallas suburb of Keller, Texas, that Wood was supposed to make the final arrangements in China before his relocation to Malaysia. 'This was going to be his last trip to Beijing. It just happened to be this one,' James Wood said. Where did it go? The plane vanished from radar on Saturday morning as it flew from Malaysia to Beijing . Hunt: A Taiwan Coast Guard picture shows a patrol ship leaving southern Taiwan to help with the search . Search: Members of the Republic of Singapore Air Force scan the seas north-east of Kota Baru, Malaysia . 'There is a shock, a very surreal moment in your life. Last Sunday, we were all having breakfast together. And now, you can't.' James Wood described his brother, a technical storage executive at IBM Malaysia, as an 'outgoing, gregarious, friendly, loving man' who was excited about his upcoming move. 'He loved to travel while he was over there. His job gave him the opportunity to do that,' he said. He said that his brother is . divorced and that one of his sons attends Texas A&M University and . that another previously graduated from that college. He added that, along with his brother, members of hundreds of other families were on Flight MH370. 'I just wanted to say to all the other families that are around the world: We're hurting. We know you're hurting just as much, and we're praying for you,' he said. Probe: Malaysian Airlines Chief Ahmad Jauhari Yahya and Department of Civil Aviation Director General Datuk Azharuddin Abdul Rahman take questions Monday as investigations into the mystery continue . Questions: Italian Luigi Maraldi, left, whose stolen passport was used by a passenger boarding the missing plane, shows his passport as he reports himself to Thai police at Phuket police station on Sunday . The family has been contacted by the U.S. Department of State and the embassy in Malaysia. A second brother, Tom Wood, said the events have left 'a real hole in our family,' but he said they aren't giving up hope. 'You never know,' he said. 'I'm not gonna close that door until we need to close it completely.' So far, no explanation as to what happened to the plane is available. There was no distress signal before the plane vanished from the radar. The family said they are watching CNN, BBC and other news stations, waiting for small pieces of information on anything about the missing plane. But, 'with a situation like this, when a plane just disappears ... it leaves you with a lot of questions,' he said.","Sarah Bajc, an American expat, waited for her boyfriend Philip Wood at their home in Beijing on Saturday as he returned from a trip to Texas .

"By . Sam Webb . Silhouetted against a sky of churning smoke and searing flame, firemen battle to contain an inferno. This was the apocalyptic scene  yesterday as fire engulfed a recycling plant in what witnesses described as ‘hell on earth’. The cause? A single  Chinese lantern. The lantern drifted down on to a bale of plastic and within minutes the flames were spreading through some 100,000 tons of recycling – worth £6million. More than 200 firefighters have been tackling . the blaze on an industrial estate in Smethwick, near Birmingham, . in the biggest blaze West Midlands Fire Service has ever seen. Scroll down for video . Inferno: Firefighters are silhouetted against the sea of flame caused by the burning mass of plastic recycling material in Smethwick, near Birmingham . The fire service said 200 firefighters were at the scene. 11 firefighters required medical treatment, three of them had to be sent to hospital . Three . firefighters were hospitalised and a further eight were injured . bringing the inferno - caused by a Chinese sky lantern that landed at . the site - under control. Shocked residents described 'apocalyptic' scenes 'like something from an action movie' that unfolded at 11pm on Sunday evening. More than 35 fire engines as well as police and ambulance crews rushed to the scene at the J & A Young recycling plant where they battled throughout the night to control the flames. The smouldering wreckage of the gutted building is still burning today and fire bosses warned the sheer scale of the blaze means it could burn all week. Thick plumes of black smoke billowed up . to 6,000ft in the air and could be seen over 80 miles away including . Oxford, Coventry and by hundreds of motorists driving on the M40 and M1 . motorways towards London. Area commander Steve Vincent, revealed it was the biggest blaze the UK's second largest fire service had seen in their 40-year history. He said: 'A Chinese lantern was spotted on CCTV floating across and into the site and starting a fire in plastic bales.' 'We haven't evacuated any of the local residents because this is mainly an industrial area but we have had some minor injuries to some of our firefighters at the scene.' Choking: The fire created a 6,000ft tall spiral of smoke. Those living nearby were urged to keep their windows closed . Glare: The fire is believed to be the biggest to have ever struck the West Midlands. As well as the recycling plant, a factory unit is also involved . Teamwork: More than 35 fire engines from emergency services throughout the region were called to the raging fire . Blaze: There were fears the smoke would cause a delay to flights at Birmingham International Airport, although none have been reported so far . An aerial photo of the burning mountain of waste. Firefighters struggled to extinguish pools of molten plastic . Fiery wasteland: Ash and dirty pools of water are left in the aftermath of the fire . This aerial view of the Jayplas recycling centre before it was set on fire by a Chinese Lantern gives a sense of the sheer scale of the site . He added: 'We're working with other emergency services and they're all safely being treated. 'We will have major congestion in this area because we will be fighting this fire for the next few days. This is the largest fire that we've had in the West Midlands. 'It is a major fire and we've got support from surrounding fire brigades to help us deal with this.' Vijith Randeniya, chief fire officer of West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service, has called for a review into the use of Chinese lanterns after the accident. From above: Aerial photo of the fire at the Jayplas, a plastics and paper recycling depot in Smethwick. The fire is the biggest that the West Midlands fire service has ever tackled . Smoke rises over the Birmingham skyline earlier today. Smethwick sits on the edge of the UK's second-largest city . A fire engine (left) is dwarfed by the fire. Firefighters had to to use plant machinery to 'break up' the bales of plastic to get at the heart of the fire . Huge mission: Three firefighters were hospitalised and a further eight were injured bringing the inferno caused by a Chinese sky lantern that landed at the site - under control . He said: 'My forensics people have been here from the start and have reviewed CCTV and and spoken to people and looked at the way the fire started and looking at the CCTV evidence, you can see a Chinese lantern floating gently, and then land and then eight minutes later you see the fire start.' He said the Chief Fire Officers Association had previously called for a review of the use of Chinese lanterns and said it was time that 'sensible people have a sensible discussion' about the issue. 'We don't want to be party poopers and we know they are used in a lot of celebrations,' he said. 'What we want to do is make sure sensible people have a sensible discussion about the use of these things. 'Clearly there is a cause and an effect . 'We have a situation where a fire has started here, £6 million worth of loss, started by one of these lanterns and that was eminently preventable.' Fear: James Gillespie, 34, who lives near the site, said: 'There was this terrifying wall of flame when I looked out of my window, it was like the apocalypse had come' An eyewitness described a series of explosions as the fire spread among the recyclable material . West Midlands Fire Service has confirmed 11 firefighters received treatment at the scene. A spokesman said three were taken to hospital - one had an eye injury and another suffered an ankle injury. It is not known what the third was hospitalised for but none of the injuries are serious . He added fire crews were expected to . be on the site until at least tomorrow, but were having to use plant . machinery to ""break up"" the bales of plastic to get at the heart of the . fire. One of the problems facing firefighters is having to extinguish molten pools of melted plastic, he said. West Midlands Police closed nearby . roads and brought in the force helicopter to relay images of the fire . down to crews working on the ground. Witness . Steven Bolton, 29, from Smethwick, said: 'It was like a scene from a . Hollywood blockbuster - I've never seen anything like it in my life. 'It was apocalyptic - there was just a wall of flames that extended as far as the eye could see. 'I could make out this silhouette of firefighters against this orange back drop. 'I could not believe what I was seeing. I've got a friend in Oxford who said he could see the smoke from the motorway.' Ian Dangerfield, a 46-year-old . documentary maker from West Bromwich, said: 'It was unbelievable. I . could smell smoke and saw a huge cloud and I thought ""there's no way . that's a big thunderstorm"". 'I went out the front door and could see the smoke going across the sky so I grabbed my camera. Police were stopping cars.' 'It was absolute chaos. I've never known anything like it in my life.' Firefighters were expecting to be at the scene for several days damping down the flames . Area commander Steve Vincent said: 'This is the largest fire that we've had in the West Midlands. It is a major fire and we've got support from surrounding fire brigades to help us deal with this' Smoke and ash even reached the city of Coventry, more than 20 miles away, with motorists in the area finding their vehicles covered with soot from the fire . Eye-witness Jack Awal said: 'It was like a scene from a movie. There were so many large explosions and loud bangs. It was like a firework display - there were loud crackles and bangs every few seconds' James Gillespie, 34, who lives near . the site, said: 'It looked like images you see on TV of a massive forest . fire in America. There was this terrifying wall of flame when I looked . out of my window, it was like the apocalypse had come.' Night . shift worker Nikolai Kosecki, 30, from Smethwick said: 'I came outside . for a break and saw flames and the fire engines arriving. Luckily it . seemed like the fire service came quickly.'

"By . Wills Robinson . Francois Hollande is facing further criticism after tax income from 2013 was little more than half what politicians had forecast . Francois Hollande is facing more criticism tonight after it emerged that France could have a 14billion-euro black hole in its public finances after hugely overestimating tax returns. Following a week that has seen his position weakened further by the National Front's European election victories, statistics revealed last year's receipts from income tax, VAT and corporation tax were wildly inaccurate. The President raised the tax when he was elected two years ago, but the surplus from 2013 was only half the 30billion-euros that was forecasted. The Court of Auditors, which oversees the government's accounts, said the revenue projections in 2013 were wildly inaccurate, overly optimistic and based on inaccurate projections. Last week French Prime Minister Manuel Valls appeared to criticise Hollande's tax policy by suggesting: 'Too much tax kills tax'. According to the BBC, opinion polls put Mr Hollande's approval rating below 20 per cent and critics say he is hurting France's economic recovery. Public spending in France is among the highest in the world and is due to hit 57 per cent of national output this year. Earlier this month, the IMF warned politicians that high taxes were holding back the recovery after the French economy ground to a halt. Since Hollande's austerity measures were brought in, unemployment rate has hit a record high of 11 per cent and economic growth has been inconsistent. In April the number of people without a job grew by a further 14,800, a new record, undermining Hollande's campaign to bring unemployment down. The Socialist leader has said he would not run for re-election in 2017 if unemployment does not fall by the end of his term. Official statistics by agency Eurostat also stated that . output in France stagnated between January and March following just one . quarter of growth at the end of last year. Opposition: The French President's position was undermined this week after France's National Front Party, headed by Marie Le Pen (pictured) surged to victory in the European elections . Stagnation in the first three months of the year contrasts with growth of 0.8 per cent in both Britain and Germany. The . Spanish economy grew by 0.4 per cent but output sank 1.4 per cent in . the Netherlands, 0.7 per cent in Portugal and 0.1 per cent in Italy. The income tax threshold for France's wealthiest citizens was raised to 75 per cent last year, prompting some French citizens, including the actor Gerard Depardieu, to leave the country and seek citizenship elsewhere in Europe. Mr Hollande has already said he will not slow the pace of deficit reduction, adding France 'cannot live with such heavy debt'. He hiked taxes when he came to power in 2012 having vigorously campaigned against austerity across Europe.","Francois Hollande has increased tax since he was elected two years ago .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A man with a bizarre addiction to petrol has been caught attempting to get high on a garage forecourt. Brian Taylor, 45, was banned from petrol stations in 2005 after slashing the pumps so that he could drink the liquid and inhale fumes. After drinking the fuel Taylor was spotted dancing around garage forecourts high on the toxic fumes. Addict: Brian Taylor, 45, is addicted to petrol, and breached an order banning him from petrol stations. He is pictured here in 2004 drinking from a pump . Asbo: Taylor is banned from going to petrol stations and having petrol in public . Consequences: Taylor has been warned he faces a return to jail if he puts 'one foot wrong' in future . The holes Taylor left in the fuel lines would mean the next driver to use the pump would end up covered in petrol. He was jailed, and given an Asbo banning him from forecourts and having petrol in public, but has repeatedly breached the order. Taylor, from Brotton, near Middlesbrough, was arrested again after being spotted at two petrol stations on the same day - a Morrisons and a Tesco outlet, both in Redcar, north Yorkshire. Court papers show that he was found with an open container of petrol. He was brought before magistrates in Teesside, where he admitted the offences and was given a suspended 16-week prison term and told to pay £120 in costs. Taylor's lawyer said that he accepted he had 'taken the drips from the petrol pumps', which she described as ''not a particularly sophisticated offence.' Dodged jail: Taylor, pictured here in 2005, was given a 16-week suspended prison sentences . The court heard that, although his history was an aggravating factor, Taylor's life was 'a lot more settled than it has been in recent years' and he was attending appointments with the probation service. When he was first convicted it emerged that Taylor had tried to attend meetings to fix his problem, but smelled so strongly of petrol that he was deemed a fire hazard and told to leave. At the sentencing on New Year's Eve, the chairman of the Teesside magistrates said it was disappointing to see him in court again, and that he was close to being sent back to prison. He said: 'You put one foot wrong now and you are going to go away.' The lethal practice of sniffing petrol and other volatile substances, such as glue kills as many as 50 people a year, and is especially prevalent in children. According to anti-abuse charity Re-Solv, sniffing volatile substances is the most common type of substance mis-use among children aged 10 and 11. Those who use petrol to get high are taking their life in their hands, as ‘sudden sniffing death syndrome’ can kill after just one use, and is estimated to take at least 50 lives a year. LOST, another solvent abuse charity, reported that dozens of people who suffered from petrol addiction were calling their helpline. A spokesman said: ‘The chemicals in the petrol, such as butane, give them a buzz which lasts ten to 20 minutes and then they try again when it wears off. They don’t realise that the first time can kill them.’ Petrol abuse has long been a big problem in South America and Australia, where it is much more widespread than in the UK. In 2006 BP rolled out an odourless petrol called Opal in aboriginal Australia to prevent residents using it to get high.","Brian Taylor, 45, breached Asbo by going to garages with a petrol container .

The TV chef has revealed that she plumped for the Muslim style swimwear because her former husband Charles Saatchi did not want her to get a tan . Friends of the star told the Sunday People that she did not pick the suit because she was shy about showing off her curvy figure, or because she was worried about getting sunburned in the 90 degree heat.

"By . Sam Webb . The death of a father-of-three who was stabbed in a row over a bike was not murder or manslaughter, a coroner has ruled. Now the family of Liam Mearns, 21, are devastated after it was ruled that there was not enough proof that the tragedy was an unlawful killing. Twelve people were arrested after Mr Mearns suffered a fatal wound that sliced into his lung and punctured his liver in Clacton, Essex, on December 13, 2011. All were eventually released without charge. Loss: Liam Mearns, 21, was . stabbed to death in December 2011. A coroner ruled his death was not . unlawful. His fiancee Hollie Morgan says she is 'devastated' about the decision. Mr Mearns also suffered a second stab wound that went through his cheek and cut through one of his teeth. Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray yesterday recorded an open verdict at his inquest, saying there was not enough proof it was murder or manslaughter. His family and friends shouted to Mrs Beasley-Murray to reconsider and change the ruling to unlawful killing. Inconclusive: Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said there was insufficient proof that the death was murder or manslaughter . She considered the request but reaffirmed her decision. After the inquest, Mr Mearns' tearful fiancee Hollie Morgan said: 'I don’t understand how they can say this was not a murder. 'Everyone can see he was stabbed. It’s not like he fell on the knife.' Miss Morgan was expecting their second child when he was killed and gave birth to Gracie-May in April 2012. She added: 'What am I supposed to tell my kids now? They have to grow up without their dad because of this and the court won’t even say it was a murder. 'We are all devastated.' The inquest heard Mr Mearns was stabbed in a row over a bicycle. Family and friends broke down in tears when doctors described the horrific injuries he suffered. Dr Ben Swift, a forensic pathologist, said: 'There were two incised wounds that were caused by a sharp-edged weapon. 'It would have required severe force to inflict the wound to his face, but the wound to his chest was fatal.' Mr Mearns stumbled away from the scene and collapsed outside nearby store Bootleggers. Dr Swift said he did not have any defensive injuries, which would have suggested he had been in a fight. He said the victim had been drinking on the day of the incident and had traces of cannabis in his system.

Brutal: The father-of-three was stabbed in the chest and in the face. 12 people were arrested in connection with his death but all were eventually released without charge . A total of 12 people were arrested in . connection with the killing, but the last suspect was released without . charge in May last year. Essex . Police said the Crown Prosecution Service had advised there was . insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. Det Chief Insp Lucy Robinson, the investigating officer, explained the events that led to the stabbing. Police have agreed to meet with Mr Mearns' family to discuss the case. They were able to question Det Chief Insp Lucy Robinson at the inquest. Liam’s aunt, Katie Norfolk said: 'It would be nice for us as a family to get more information. 'We sit at home waiting for something to happen. 'We would like to see the case reopened to look at the evidence again.' Det Con Insp Robinson said: 'The case was reviewed by us and the Crown Prosecution Service and significant issues were raised around the inconsistencies between accounts and the credibility of the witnesses.' She said an off-duty police officer saw the commotion and discovered Liam’s body. It was alleged Ben Mills-Matheou, one of Liam’s friends, had taken a bike that belonged to Danny Mellowship. Mr Mellowship is alleged to have confronted Mr Mills-Matheou who then called Liam. Mr Mearns and a group of others are thought to have gone to Mr Mellowship’s house in Wellesley Road. Miss Morgan called her father Andrew Morgan and asked him to stop her fiance. Mr Morgan told the inquest he arrived to find Liam doubled over. Mrs Beasley-Murray recorded an open verdict, saying there was insufficient evidence for her to label it an unlawful killing. She said: 'This court has a duty to look afresh at the evidence and is not fettered by any decision made by the Crown Prosecution Service. 'This court is not sure to the required standard of proof that this is murder or manslaughter. We shall never quite know what exactly happened in the darkness on that day.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Killer: A California appeals court has upheld the life sentence for John Riccardi convicted 20 years ago of murdering two women, including Dave Navarro's mother . A California appeals court has upheld the life sentence for a man who killed the mother of rock guitarist Dave Navarro and her friend three decades ago. The 2nd District Court of Appeal upheld John Riccardi's prison term Thursday after rejecting his attorney's request to overturn his sentence and dismiss the case. Riccardi was convicted of killing his estranged girlfriend, Connie Navarro, and Sue Jory in 1983 at a West Los Angeles condominium. Navarro's son, Dave, played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jane's Addiction. He was only 15 years old when his mother was murdered. Riccardi originally was sentenced to death for the murders, but the California Supreme Court overturned the sentence two years ago after a prospective juror was wrongly dismissed for expressing conflicting views on the death penalty. The convicted killer was re-sentenced last year to life without parole. On March 3, 1983, Constance 'Connie' Navarro's ex-boyfriend John Riccardi forced his way into her home in West Los Angeles and killed her and her friend Sue Jory. Police later found 41-year-old Navarro's body partially stuffed inside a linen closet. Rock star: Connie Navarro's son, Dave, was only 15 years old when his mother was murdered. He later went on to play with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jane's Addiction, and marry Carmen Electra (right) Psychological scars: His mother's violent death had a profound impact on the rock guitarist, who had spent years battling addiction and depression . Dave Navarro, then 15, was staying with his father on the night of the murders. Years later, the famed guitarist said Riccardi likely would have killed him too had he been in his mother's apartment at the time. 'So I really do believe that that’s some sort of divine intervention that I can’t explain,' the rock star said. After the slaying, John Riccardi spent eight years on the run before he was finally arrested in Houston in January 1991 after the TV show America’s Most Wanted aired a segment about him. During questioning, Riccardi admitted that he and Connie Navarro were on bad terms after their split, but he denied killing her, San Francisco Chronicle reported. Branded: To honor his late mother, Navarro had tattoo artist Kate Von D ink an image of Connie as a young woman on his left rib cage . The . victim’s son said that a week before his mother brutal killing, . her jealous boyfriend broke into her home and handcuffed him at . gunpoint, but Dave only reported the incident to police after Connie . Navarro’s death. In 1993, Riccardi was found guilty of two counts of murder and sentenced to death due to the heinous nature of the crimes, but the sentence was overturned in 2012 because of a problem with a juror. The juror in question, identified only by the initials 'N.K.' in the ruling, wrote on the questionnaire that she supported California's reinstatement of the death penalty and stated that it is not used enough. But later in the questionnaire, the juror gave answers that suggest she opposes capital punishment. 'I'm afraid I could not feel right in imposing the death penalty on someone even though I feel it is nessasary (sic) under some circumstances,' N.K. wrote. Dave Navarro, 47, the founding member of Jane's Addiciton and Carmen Electra's ex-husband, has publicly blamed his struggle with drugs, alcohol and depression that landed him in a hospital seven time on the tragic loss he experienced as a teenager. He later honored his late mother by having the tattoo artist and reality star Kat Von D ink a portrait of Connie as a young woman on his left rib cage.","John Riccardi was found guilty in 1993 of killing Connie Navarro, Dave Navarro's mother, and Sue Jory .

"By . Emily Allen . Huge queues were building up at Heathrow Airport this morning after half of all the immigration desks were shut - even though the Olympics are just weeks away, it has emerged. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said he was appalled at the length of . queues when he visited the airport at 7am this morning. Official figures showed the wait at immigration control for non-EU passengers was 56 minutes despite a 45 minute target. Yet more delays: Official figures showed the wait at immigration control at Heathrow this morning were 56 minutes despite the 45 minute target (file picture) The queues don't bode well for the huge numbers of people who will be coming through the airport in two weeks time for the London Olympics, as well as Brits going and returning from their summer holidays. Mr Vaz's comments come after shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper . said it was a disgrace that international athletes were waiting longer . than two hours to pass through immigration control. And, just last week chaotic . scenes were photographed at the airport, with a sea of . stressed passengers forced to wait in queues stretching half a mile to . get through immigration control. The Immigration Service Union, which represents 4,500 border staff, said at the time . that the problems were made worse as only about half the . current workers were fully trained to allow passengers from anywhere in . the world entry. Visit: Keith Vaz said he was appalled at the length of the queues at Heathrow this morning . In April Labour published leaked figures showing 800 UK Border Force . posts have been cut in the past two years – 10 per cent of the total – . with another 700 set to go by 2015. At . the time, ministers said they would draft in more than 550 volunteers . to help stem the chaos during the Olympics, but they will receive just . four days training on how to operate passport controls. Mr Vaz said: 'I was appalled by the length of queues in the immigration hall this morning. 'It is now two months since the Immigration Minister promised additional resources and better management. 'The . worst aspect was that half of the immigration desks were simply not . opened even though the Border Force had prior knowledge of all flight . arrivals. 'This creates additional security . pressures with luggage piling up in the baggage hall. We look forward to . hearing the Immigration Minister’s explanation for this tomorrow.' A Border Force spokesman insisted Mr Vaz was incorrect. 'Queues at Terminal 4 remained under an hour at all times,' he said. 'Staff were quickly redeployed and more than 80 per cent of desks were open to process passengers as quickly as possible.' Yesterday, Ms Cooper said many of . those forced to wait in long queues were Olympic athletes, who will be . arriving ahead of the opening ceremony on July 27 to acclimatise to UK . conditions. A leaked memo . reveals that tourists arriving from outside the European Economic Area . are repeatedly waiting longer than the 45-minute target time to pass . through passport control. Meanwhile, European visitors are waiting 40 minutes when it should take less than 25 minutes to have their documents checked. Ms Cooper accused Home Secretary Theresa May of failing to ensure enough staff were employed at peak times. She added: 'These figures are a disgrace. With just . three weeks to go until the Olympics people are waiting more than two . hours at Heathrow, and the targets for Terminal 4 have been breached on . 26 of the last 30 days. 'The Home Secretary ought to be able to make sure there are proper . security checks without long queues. After all, there has been long . enough to prepare for the Olympics. 'Instead, she has cut 900 Border Agency staff and these documents show there are still too few staff in place at peak times.' Not happy: Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it was a 'disgrace' athletes had to wait while immigration minister Damien Green must explain why . But Mr Green said the Government’s . actions to tackle queues 'have resulted in real improvement over the . last two months - including consistently hitting our targets on UK and . EU passengers and reducing waiting times across the board'. 'But . we’re not complacent about some long waiting times, which is why this . weekend we have increased staffing numbers by more than 50 per cent at . Heathrow to respond to large passengers volumes,' he said. Cuts: Home Secretary Theresa May has been criticised for cutting 900 Border Agency staff . 'And by the start of peak Olympic arrivals in less than 10 days, there will be up to 500 additional staff on our rotas across the country - this includes enough staff at Heathrow to cover every desk during busy times. 'Additionally we have special lanes in place designated to Olympic athletes to enable them to pass through the border without delay.' Despite the queues, Heathrow itself - which is not in charge of immigration -  seems to be going to great lengths to welcome athletes arriving in the country. A series of Olympics greeting desks manned by five members of staff have been rolled out across the airport. The airport is also . recruiting 1,000 volunteers from local communities who, among other . things, will wave off each flight leaving Heathrow after the Games. The airport is also building a special . terminal for athletes departing from the Olympics. It will be the same . size as the Paralympic seven-a-side football pitch and have 31 check-in . desks and seven security lanes. August 13 will see more passengers and bags than Heathrow has ever had in a single day. The airport expects to process . 137,800 people leaving on that day, and 200,000 bags instead of an . average of 150,000 on a normal day. A spokesman for airport operator BAA . said: 'Immigration waiting times for passengers during peak periods at . Heathrow in the last few days have been unacceptably long and the Home . Office should be delivering a good experience for regular passengers as . well as for Olympic visitors.' He went on: 'Immigration is a matter . for the Home Office. The Home Office has said that from July 15 all . Border Force desks at Heathrow will be open during peak Olympic arrival . periods.'","Queues were 56 minutes for non-EU passengers this morning despite 45 minute target .

"By . Wills Robinson . Kittens have been paralysed, had their skulls broken and had ­electrodes stuck onto their brains, ribs and spine as part of a series of shocking experiments at 10 of the country's most prestigious universities. The cruel procedures on the helpless subjects have been performed so scientists can improve their understanding of the human body. Some of the animals were raised in complete darkness while others had one of their eyes stitched closed so scientists could analyse problems surrounding 'lazy eye'. Others had their lungs deliberately collapsed during the brutal procedures and many were injected with paralysing drugs to stop them moving or breathing. Scroll down for video . Horrifying: Kittens had their skulls cracked open before electrodes were inserted into their brain. This picture was taken during a similar procedure at the University of Wisconsin . Brutal: Scientists put the kittens under anaesthetic but when the procedures were finished, most of the cats were given fatal overdoses. Animal charity PETA captured these images at Wisconsin University last year . Scientists put the kittens under anaesthetic but when the experiments were finished, most of them were killed. In a document seen by Mail Online, 10 universities including Cambridge were listed as having performed the controversial tests. University College London gave adult cats anaesthetic before screwing plates into their skull while they were placed face down. Electrodes were then attached to their spine to 'investigate how abdominal nerve cells and muscles work together to allow for normal respiration, coughing and breathing.' To test 'feedback mechanisms' between the eyes and the brain, they placed electrodes onto certain areas of the brain after removing parts of their skull. The University of Bristol purposely bred cats for their experiments, which involved 'cutting through the skin and bone to gain access to the skull.' Some of the food regimes, which lasted for six weeks, were high in fat and harmful. Cardiff University and University of Edinburgh raised kittens and their mothers in 'complete darkness' to test how certain brain functions related to amblyopia, commonly known as ‘lazy eye’. Some kittens were raised normally and then placed in complete darkness for a week. Other kittens had one eye closed through the use of sutures in the eyelids for up to seven days. Major head surgery was done to prepare the kittens for testing. They were then anaesthetised and paralysed with a drug which prevented them from breathing or moving. A hole was made through their throats into their tracheas (wind pipe) so that a tube could be inserted and used to artificially 'breathe' for them. The Royal Veterinary College is also said to be 'directly involved' in the experiments. Experiments: Procedures where skulls were cracked opened and electrodes inserted were carried out to test the 'feedback mechanisms' between the eyes and the brain. This animal was part of an experiment at the University of Wisconsin . Animal campaigners have reacted angrily to the revelations with one calling the procedures 'repulsive'. Andrew . Tyler, the director of Animal Aid said: 'The extreme suffering and . stress endured by the cats and kittens used in these repulsive . experiments is deeply disturbing to imagine. 'Quite . apart from the suffering caused, these appalling procedures are highly . unlikely to contribute to medical progress, since the results of animal . experiments cannot be reliably translated to humans. 'Instead . of torturing cats and kittens in perversely cruel experiments, . University College London should move into the twenty-first century and . embrace the wide range of non-animal methods that are available to . scientists and produce valid, human-relevant results.' The shocking treatment of the kittens was outlined in a report by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV). CEO of the BUAV, Michelle Thew, said: . 'Over 5 million families in the UK share their home with one or more . cats yet these much loved animals are still being used in cruel . experiments in which they can be subjected to invasive brain surgery or . deliberately deprived of light or vision by being raised in total . darkness or by having their eyelids sewn shut. 'Much . of the research is fundamental and the BUAV believes that sophisticated . alternative techniques, which do not involve animal suffering, should . be used instead. We are calling on the Government to end the cruel use . of cats in UK laboratories.' Comedian and author, Alexei Sayle, who is campaigning with the BUAV, will deliver report titled ‘What is happening to cats?’ to the Home Office. Mr Sayle said: 'As a cat owner myself I . know what wonderful companions they can be and how affectionate, . intelligent and playful. 'That . is why I am joining with the BUAV to ask the UK Government to bring an . end to the use of all cats in experimentation. It is time to stop this . cruel and unnecessary suffering.' Last year, animal charity PETA challenged the University of Wisconsin over their treatment of cats during animal testing. The organisation managed to capture some of the animals during the procedures. A spokesman from the University of Cambridge said: 'The research to which BUAV refers involved scientists from a number of UK institutions, including researchers from University of Cambridge, who analysed tissue samples. 'This research was part of the development of a potential new treatment for amblyopia (lazy eye), a common disorder of vision which affects one in 50 children. 'As it would be unethical to carry out such research using humans, initial studies were carried out using mice and rats; in order to further understand whether the treatment was effective, it was then necessary to carry out further work in a higher order animal – in this case a small number of cats. ' Controversial: Ten of the country's most prestigious universities were said to be involved in the procedures similar to that performed at the University of Wisconsin (pictured). Many of the cats were held down like this during the brutal experiments . A spokesman for University College London said the experiments mentioned in the article were carried out in 1992 and 1998. Reacting to the allegations, Cardiff University spokesperson said: 'The research referenced in today’s story ended in 2010. 'Our . research involving animals is aimed at the alleviation of human and . veterinary disease through the advancement of medical, dental, . biological and veterinary understanding. 'All . animal-related research work at Cardiff University is designed and . carried out in accordance with the principles of the 3Rs under . veterinary oversight and in compliance with the strict conditions . imposed by the UK Government.' A representative from Bristol University said it could state categorically that the type of research highlighted has not been carried out at the University for at least seven years .

"By . Chris Greenwood, Crime Reporter . The police bill for staking out the embassy where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is evading justice has already reached more than £1million. Scotland Yard confirmed it is costing £11,000 every day to ensure the Australian does not flee his bolthole at the Ecuadorean Embassy. The final bill could be much more as the 41-year-old continues to defy extradition to Sweden where he is suspected of sexually assaulting two women. Hefty bill: A phalanx of Scotland Yard police officers surrounds the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has taken refuge as he evades sex assault allegations . Officers have been watching the property in Knightsbridge, west London, since Mr Assange breached his bail and claimed asylum in June. They have been told to arrest him if he puts ‘one toe’ outside. Ecuadorean foreign minister Ricardo Pinto has warned Mr Assange he could be in the embassy for a decade if he is not allowed to leave Britain. Critics have called on the Metropolitan Police to end the costly stakeout. Last week, Foreign Secretary William Hague admitted there is ‘no sign of any breakthrough’ after meeting Mr Pinto at the United Nations in New York. The comments came after the hacking . activist accused the U.S. of persecuting WikiLeaks and torturing Bradley . Manning, the soldier accused of leaking classified documents. 24/7 surveillance: Officers have been watching the property in Knightsbridge since Assange (pictured) breached his bail and claimed asylum in June . At least four Met officers guard the embassy, on the second floor of a block of flats behind Harrods in Knightsbridge, West London, around the clock. They have set up a £250,000 mobile command station on the doorstep of the building and occupy positions outside and in surrounding properties. Officers from every London borough, specialist police units and undercover squads have been brought in to join the open-ended stake out. One colleague said: ‘The officers are being moved around every three or four days to stop the boredom setting in. ‘There are certainly plenty of other things these officers could be doing than standing there around the clock.’ Time well spent? At least four Met officers guard the embassy, on the second floor of a block of flats behind Harrods, around the clock . London Mayor Boris Johnson confirmed the policing bill between June 20 and September 10 was £905,000. If the costs continued at the average of £11,000 a day the total would now be over £1.1million. Critics called on the Met to end the stand-off but sources said the force cannot step back from its responsibilities to arrest Mr Assange for breaching his bail. Jenny Jones, a Green politician in the capital who sits on a committee that oversees the Met’s work, called for the officers to go back on the beat. She said: ‘It is ridiculous at a time when the Met is stretched as never before that so many officers are waiting around the Ecuadorian Embassy for Assange to attempt an escape.’ Lib Dem Caroline Pidgeon, who also sits on the London Assembly, added: ‘For 100 days Assange has been evading an arrest warrant for the alleged offence of rape and trying to escape the fair judicial process of Sweden. ‘At a time when police counters are closing across London his actions are a gross waste of valuable resources.’","At least four Met officers stand guard around the clock .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . The family who insists their young girl was booted from a KFC restaurant despite multiple investigations finding otherwise has changed its tune about keeping the thousands donated by the company to help fix the child's face. Victoria Wilcher's adult relatives now say they have asked the fried chicken chain to donate the $30,000 to the foundation of a doctor who has donated his services to the three-year-old. 'The family didn't think it was appropriate to accept KFC's donation, but KFC is invited to make a donation to the Frank Stile foundation,' Bill Kellum said in a statement Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Hoax victim? A source involved in the . investigation said all the evidence in the case points towards . the matter being a hoax and that Victoria Wilcher, three, wasn't asked . to leave a KFC in Mississippi . Stile, based in Las Vegas, previously offered to work on Victoria Wilcher's face, scarred from a pit bull mauling, for free after the scandal first erupted. The about-face came after KFC said it intends to honor its commitment to donate the money towards Wilcher's medical bills despite finding evidence that employees were guilty of wrongdoing. Two different investigations have failed to find proof the . 3-year-old girl and her grandmother were asked to leave because . injuries she suffered in a pit bull mauling disturbed customers. KFC . spokesman Rick Maynard said previously that the company considered the . matter closed after an internal investigation by the franchise . restaurant in Jackson, Mississippi, and an independent probe. ‘Like the rest of America, the KFC family has been moved by the story of Victoria's injuries and recovery,’ Maynard said. ‘We hope everyone keeps Victoria in their thoughts and prayers. She will certainly be in ours.’ Allegations that Victoria was asked to leave the restaurant were made earlier this month on the Facebook site Victoria's Victories, which has followed her recovery from the April attack. Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, stands by her claim of what happened at the restaurant. 'Victoria's family appreciates the actions of KFC in their investigation of this matter. They look forward to assisting KFC in what we hope will be an ongoing investigation,' Kellum previously said on her behalf. Hurt: Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, left, now stands accused of making the whole story up . 'It is deeply disappointing that other parties have taken opportunity to attack Victoria through social and news media outlets. Victoria is an innocent child with very real physical and emotional scars. 'The focus of her family has always been, and will always be on Victoria and making her whole again,' Kellum said. He said the child's family is grateful for outpouring of concern for her. The family-maintained Facebook page called Victoria's Victories also issued another statement denying that the whole thing was hoax, the page was taken down only hours later. 'I promise its not a hoax, I never thought any of this would blow up the way it has. ... Please do not believe untrue media. I have personally watched this family go without to provide for Victoria. They have not and would not do anything to hurt Victoria in any way,' read the statement. After the family's story became public, donations poured into the family's GoFundMe fund-raising page. Before . the story hit the headlines, the page for Victoria had . raised only $600, but since then more than $135,000 has been raised. No . shows: After reviewing surveillance tape from the . branch the investigators have found that the girl and her grandmother, . who claimed they had been asked to leave, didn't even visit the . restaurant that day . The CEO of the fund-raising webpage GoFundMe, Brad Damphousse, issued a statement on Tuesday suspending the campaign and offering to refund donations, reports CNN. 'In lieu of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the 'Victoria's Victories' online fundraising effort, GoFundMe has temporarily suspended the campaign until the full truth is made clear,' the statement said. Hannon Food Services, which operates the KFC restaurant, also issued a statement in which said it said it was deeply troubled by the allegation. As part of its investigation, Hannon said it spent hundreds of hours reviewing surveillance video, interviewing employees and hired the outside investigator. The company said it would reach out to the child's family for additional discussions. Victoria Wilcher, who lost an eye in a dog attack, made headlines earlier this month after her family posted a photo entitled 'Does this face look scary to you?' on a Facebook page, Victoria's Victories. Denial: In a statement posted on Facebook on Tuesday, the family denied they had made up the story and said the investigation was ongoing . The allegations against KFC drew widespread condemnation and prompted the chain to donate $30,000 towards Victoria’s charity, as an independent review was launched into the incident. An unnamed source involved in the investigation told the Laurel Leader-Call that all the evidence in the case suggests the May 15 story told by Kelly Mullins, was a hoax. After reviewing surveillance tape from the Woodrow Wilson Drive branch – and another in Jackson - investigators found that the woman and the little girl didn't even visit the restaurant that day. The grandmother had also previously told WAPT that she ‘ordered a sweet tea and mashed potatoes and gravy’ at the restaurant before they were asked to leave. But . a review of transactions on May 15 at both Jackson locations found . those items weren’t included in the same order at any point. And no one . matching the description of Mullins or Victoria visited either . restaurant, the Leader-Call reported. 'It just didn’t happen,' the . source told the newspaper. Apology: The family shared the alleged story on Victoria's Facebook page and KFC was quick to apologize . Victoria had been injured in April when three of her grandfather's pit . bull dogs ran into his home in Simpson County by ripping through the back door of the home before jumping on her. They dragged the little girl outside into the backyard, where they . continued to maul her before her grandfather, Donald Mullins, and his . girlfriend, Rita Tompkins, attempted to stop the carnage. The dogs then . attacked their owners, causing Mullins to shoot them. Two of the dogs . were killed. Victoria was rushed to the emergency room. She suffered a shattered top and . bottom jaw, broken cheekbones and eyesockets, a broken nose, lost her . right eye, and lost the ability to move the right side of her face. Mullins and Tompkins were arrested on charges of child endangerment and their eight surviving pit bulls were seized by Animal . Control officers. Victoria was in the hospital for a month after the attack and upon her return home, she . continued with physical therapy and wore a feeding tube. Attack: Victoria is pictured left before the attack in April. Right, she is pictured the hospital six hours after her grandfather's dogs attacked her - claiming her right eye in the incident and causing facial paralysis . Getting better: She is expected to undergo several more surgeries in the future as she heals from the attack . Stile then pledged to donate the costs of covering the . expensive reconstructive procedures, likely in the tens of thousands of . dollars. Dick West, who owns . the local Jackson KFC franchises, posted on Facebook about the incident . on Saturday. 'When . the allegation was first made, KFC pledged $30,000 to go to medical . expenses and started an investigation to find the truth,' he wrote. 'They have pledged the money even if it is proven that the incident . never happened. At this point their story is full of holes. Any thinking . person who follows their timeline can see it. The event at KFC never . happened.' It is unclear if Mullins will face criminal charges if found to have made up the incident.","KFC intends to honor its commitment to donate $30,000 towards Victoria Wilcher's medical bills .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Militant trade union leader Bob Crow left a six-figure nest egg for his family when he passed away – but his ex-wife will not receive a share of it. The former RMT chief’s partner Nicola Hoarau, 50, and the three children they had together will inherit £106,000. However, his ex-wife, Geraldine Horan, and their daughter Kerrie, were left out of the will, according to the probate office in London, which oversees the distribution of a deceased person’s estate. Scroll down for video . Will: Bob Crow, who passed away in March, has left £106,000 to his partner and three children . It said that Mr Crow’s estate was worth £325,000 before outstanding affairs were settled. The fortune Ms Hoarau has inherited is mainly made up of savings and investments. Mr Crow was 52 when he died in March this year from a massive heart attack. He cut a controversial figure – adored by his union members, but often heavily criticised by commuters and politicians for his eagerness to call Tube strikes in London while enjoying a champagne lifestyle. Inheritance: Mr Crow's six-figure nest egg has been left to Nicola Hoarau (pictured) Woodford home: Mr Crow lived in publicly funded council accommodation despite earning six figures . The RMT leader rose from a modest background to running an organisation with 80,000 members on a six-figure pay deal. Mr Crow was elected to run the RMT in 2002, catapulting him to national fame - and notoriety - as the most radical of a new generation of union leaders. Crow liked to be seen as a working-class hero, but was paid £145,000 a year, enjoyed fine dining in top London restaurants — memorably once quaffing champagne and running up a £650 lunch bill with four of his Left-wing brothers — and recently sparked a furore by taking a cruise to Latin America just before yet another of his strikes. Crow also came under fire for taking a holiday to Brazil on the eve of one Tube strike. But he defended his holiday, saying: 'What do you want me to do? Sit under a tree and read Karl Marx every day?' He also came in for criticism because of his insistence on living in publicly funded council accommodation in the north of the capital despite his hefty salary. However, the outspoken union boss always refused to apologise, saying that he deserved his pay packet, and insisted he had a right to live in the home which he shared with Ms Hoarau, an RMT employee. Mr Crow spied Nicola Hoarau in the street near his Woodford home after his marriage to Ms Horan had failed. Immediately he was smitten. Having obtained her phone number, he left her a message: ‘I know where you live, but I’m not a stalker. I’m going to stand under the lamp-post outside your home. If you don’t like what you see, don’t come down.’ She did like what she saw, and they were together for the next 20 years. Outside politics, Mr Crow was a passionate supporter of Millwall Football Club, where he would go to watch games with his father. He was also fanatically interested in the weather, once saying: 'I spend ages looking at weather maps and graphs. 'I have a barometer in the house and if I could have been anything else other than a union official I would have been a footballer - or a weatherman.'","Militant trade union leader leaves £106k to partner Nicola Hoarau and kids .

"By . Richard Spillett . The former country home of one of Hollywood's most famous actresses has gone on the market for £3.5million. Tickerage Mill, near Uckfield, East Sussex, was bought by Vivien Leigh for just £20,000 in 1961 and, after she died of tuberculosis in 1967, her ashes were scattered on the pond of the country estate. Estate agents say interest in the property has soared since its current owners, Ken and Honer Hoggins, decided to sell up. Scroll down for video . Tickerage Mill, the former country home of actress Vivien Leigh, has gone on the market and is expected to sell for around £3.5million . Leigh is said to have welcomed a number of famous people to the property, including former husband Laurence Olivier, Princess Margaret, John Gielgud, John Merivale and Winston Churchill . Leigh pictured at the property (left) and in 1967 with Canadian actor John Merivale, who was her companion in her final years . The Grade II listed five-bedroom mansion comes with an ancient bluebell wood, a walled-garden and a separate gardener's cottage. Leigh bought bought the property following her divorce from Laurence Olivier in 1960 and used it as a country hideaway from life in London. She lived in the house at a time she was in a relationship with Canadian actor John Merivale, who helped her during her struggle with depression from 1960 until her death in 1967. Leigh was distraught following her break-up from Olivier and was quoted by a friend as having said she'd 'rather have lived a short life with Larry [her name for Olivier] than face a long one without him.' But she found solace in the arms of Merivale, who knew of her condition and is said to have promised Olivier he would look after her. It is believed the property welcomed a number of famous guests during her time there, including Princess Margaret, John Gielgud, Winston Churchill. Leigh's ashes were scattered over the property's pond following her death at the age of 53 in 1967 after she fell ill during rehearsals for a play in the West End . The property's present owners, Ken and Honor Hoggins, have lived in the house since 2005 and have tried to maintain Leigh's influence on the home and garden . Estate agents say the property's tucked away location, but relative proximity to London, would have attracted huge interest even without the link to Leigh . One of the house's walls is covered in wisteria and Leigh is said to have ensured that many of the flowers there in her time were white when in bloom, her favourite colour . Leigh's friend, Radie Harris, wrote of her time there time: 'Vivien fell in love with [the house] at first sight. 'Her stamp was everywhere - in her utterly feminine blue bedroom and dressing room; her library of well-stacked and well-thumbed books; her beautifully appointed drawing room with her silver-framed photographs of friends from all over the world; her collection of snuff boxes and Staffordshire and Spode china. 'It was in her garden that she found her happiest moments and relaxation from many tensions. No matter how late she went to bed, she was up at six o'clock in the morning planting or replanting shrubs, flowers, and plants.' It is believed she positioned a bench in the garden where she could catch the last rays of sunlight before sunset. A number of features of the house, including the large oriel window overlooking the pond, were added by artist Richard Wyndham, who bought the estate in the 1920s .

Wysock-Wright of Savills Estate Agents said: 'It's a unique property in itself, even without the Vivien Leigh link. Mills are increasingly hard to find, especially one such as this which is so tucked away but at the same time so accessible to so many places. 'We have received a lot of interest, obviously because of the Vivien Leigh nostalgia, but also from people who, like her, want a real retreat, somewhere that's completely tucked away in the countryside.' Leigh is just one of a number of famous owners of the property, including artist Richard Wyndham, who purchased the property in the 1920s and soon added his own artist’s studio. Sir Ronald Armstrong Jones - father of Princess Margaret's husband Lord Snowdon - and Kenneth Letts, the manufacturer of Letts Diaries, were also previous residents.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Those who come to the Hamptons - known for its swanky cocktail parties and sweeping vineyards - looking for alcohol-fuelled parties on the beach could soon be out of luck. East Hampton lawmakers are close to an alcohol ban at Indian Wells Beach - a usually family-friendly stretch that peeved residents are now calling 'Fratster Beach' after rowdy out-of-towners held wild, spring break-style parties there the last two summers. Officials said the worst offenders would drink themselves to oblivion, stumble drunkenly into the surf, use the sand dunes as toilets and expose other beachgoers, including children, to an uncensored array of unseemly acts. Party beach: The Indian Wells Beach in Amagansett, N.Y., where the East Hampton Town Board is proposing banning alcohol after complaints about out of towners getting drunk and rowdy last year . In addition to being the only municipality on the east end of Long Island that allows alcohol on the beach, East Hampton is one of the few tourist destinations in the country where drinking on the beach is still allowed. Towns in the Carolinas and Florida started banning drinking on their beaches in the 1970s. San Diego enacted a ban in 2008 after a Labor Day celebration turned violent. A picture posted on Instagram last summer of bikini- and board short-clad 20-somethings clutching bottles and cans of beer at Indian Wells Beach carried this matter-of-fact caption: 'Take all of your perceptions about frats ... and put them on a beach.' Citing complaints about such behavior, East Hampton councilwoman Sylvia Overby proposed a measure in the spring to completely ban alcohol at Indian Wells and an adjacent beach during daytime lifeguard hours. That proved too broad for another group with authority over East Hampton's 26 beaches, the town trustees, a body established by King James II's royal governor in 1686. This week, ahead of the long Fourth of July weekend that is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors, they came to an agreement: a 9am to 5pm ban on alcohol on the main 2,000ft stretch of the beach where most visitors congregate and lifeguards patrol during swimming hours. A public hearing on the proposed ban is scheduled for July 17. A sticker advertising a local brewery on a post at Indian Wells Beach: East Hampton is one of the few tourist destinations in the country where drinking on the beach is still allowed . Supervisor Larry Cantwell says East Hampton is open to all comers - Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian recently filmed scenes for their reality show at Indian Wells Beach, to the chagrin of locals - as long as they're responsible. 'It's the behaviour that's being created by the drinking that's the problem,' he says. Dan Limmer says he and other Long Islanders have had to abide by drinking bans in other towns for years. East Hampton, he says, is behind the times. 'Why is a law being created now when it's always been a law on other beaches?' he says. 'They shouldn't have a different set of rules. We can't drink, so why should they?' Trustee Deborah Klughers said she fears banning drinking at Indian Wells will compel the rowdy crowds to infiltrate the town's other beaches, particularly in Montauk, where it will remain legal. Overby says, 'If the problem moves, then the laws will move with it.'","East Hampton is one of the few places to still allow drinking on the beach .
But some warn a ban on a single beach will send drinkers to other spots .

Lola's 23-year-old father Stephen Page, who admitted he had not seen his daughter 'for about five months', yesterday denied acting violently towards Miss Ball. He claimed social services had been monitoring Lola since birth because of concerns about Miss Ball's family, adding: 'I just want Lola found safe and well.'

The extraordinary bid won the top prize at the Conservatives’ summer fundraising ball on Wednesday. It was reportedly won by Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of Vladimir Chernukhin, who was deputy finance minister under Russian president Vladimir Putin. Anyone for tennis? The Tory party has auctioned a game of tennis with David Cameron and Boris Johnson for £160,000 - to the wife of a former Russian government minister . She is a banker whose husband has donated £5,500 to the party in the last two years. The former head of Britain’s sleaze watchdog said yesterday that senior Tories should publish details of meetings with foreign billionaires and party donors. Sir Alistair Graham said: ‘It is perfectly legitimate for parties to seek donations, but it must be transparent. These events have a corrosive effect on public trust because there is no transparency.’ At the same function, a bottle of champagne signed by former prime minister Margaret Thatcher was auctioned for £40,000. Other lots were said to include a ‘fantastic eight-gun pheasant shoot’ on the Oxfordshire estate of Syrian-born billionaire Wafic Said, which reportedly sold for £80,000. Guests are said to have dined on smoked duck and chicken rillettes, sea bass and asparagus, and chocolate orange truffle cake with chantilly cream.

"By . Jack Doyle . Miscarriage: Andrea Leadsom, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said the period after the birth was 'quite traumatic' A Tory minister has described how she suffered from post-natal depression and endured two miscarriages following the birth of her first son. Andrea Leadsom, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said the period after the birth was ‘quite traumatic and unlike anything ever before’. And she called for more help for new mums to prevent post-natal depression. Mrs Leadsom, 51, who was a senior executive at Barclays at the time, said she went back to work full-time after her son was born and the bank refused to let her go part-time. But she said the depression ‘didn’t last very long’ and going back to work actually ‘sorted me out’. She also revealed that after the birth of her third child she went straight to a selection meeting for a constituency where she was hoping to be selected as the Tory candidate. She said: ‘The day you give birth, you feel like you can do anything. The day after, you feel like you’ve been run over by a bus.’ Mrs Leadsom entered Parliament in 2010 after a long career in banking and was appointed to the Treasury in April after the resignation of Maria Miller as Culture Secretary. The MP for South Northamptonshire is a trustee of a local ‘Parent Infant Project’ which aims to help parents of children under two bond better with their children. Mrs Leadsom said violent crime and mental health problems in later life could be ‘laid at the door of a very bad early start’. She told House Magazine that her mother, a trained midwife, had carried out research into post-traumatic stress women suffer because of ‘appalling childbirth experiences’. ‘So if you’re completely traumatised by a terrible birth, it can actually be PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) wrongly diagnosed as post-natal depression. 'She lectured around the world on that subject. When my first son was born I was at Barclays, I was a senior executive, they wouldn’t let me go part-time. I had two miscarriages, I had a bout of post-natal depression. ‘I don’t want to over-egg it because it didn’t last very long and actually going back to work sorted me out. But I certainly remember the period after my first child being quite traumatic and unlike anything ever before.’ Mrs Leadsom said post-traumatic stress disorder can be wrongly diagnosed as  post-natal depression . Mrs Leadsom says she understood the problem and that more should be done to intervene in the ‘peri-natal’ period immediately after the birth to prevent severe depression or domestic violence as these can have ‘utterly life-changing consequences’ for the baby. She added: ‘Many of the ills of our society, violent crime, homelessness, psychosis, self-harming can be laid at the door of a very bad early start. But so too can a lot of poor mental health, backache, depression, relationship breakdown.’ It is understood Mrs Leadsom does not make any link between her miscarriages and her going back to work full-time. She told how she turned up to the selection meeting for the Reading East constituency in 2003 on the same day that she gave birth to her third child. When she was interviewed to appear on David Cameron’s ‘A-list’ of candidates she was asked about that day. ‘They were thinking, “you must be off your rocker”,’ she said. Mrs Leadsom also revealed that in her experience Parliament was much better than the City in terms of sexism and how women are treated. She said: ‘All I can say is my ten years in the thick of the City, compared to my four years in Parliament, I would say Parliament is a million times less sexist, less misogynist, more egalitarian.’","Andrea Leadsom said the period after birth of first son was 'quite traumatic'

A Spanish judge has moved closer to charging Princess Cristina, the sister of newly proclaimed King Felipe, in a tax fraud and money-laundering investigation involving her husband. Palma de Mallorca investigative magistrate Jose Castro today kept Cristina on a list of suspects he thinks should stand trial as he wrapped up a four-year pre-trial investigation. The judge said Cristina is suspected of two counts of co-operation in tax fraud and one of money-laundering. He said her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, is accused of embezzlement and fraud. Neither has been formally charged. Prosecutors and defendants will study the ruling and present their accusations or arguments. The judge will then decide on what charges to bring, a step not likely to occur before September. In court appearances, Princess Cristina and her husband have denied wrongdoing. The state prosecutor has long opposed having Cristina as a suspect and has said he will appeal Castro's ruling. The case centres on allegations that Urdangarin used his Duke of Palma title to embezzle some 6 million euros ($8 million dollars) in public contracts through the Noos Institute, a non-profit foundation he and a business partner set up that channeled money to other businesses, including Aizoon, a company he owned with Cristina. The decision in the case comes less than a week after Cristina's elder brother, Felipe, was proclaimed king following the abdication of his father Juan Carlos. The 76-year-old Juan Carlos said he was stepping aside after a four-decade reign so younger royal blood could energize the country. But the fraud case involving his daughter and other scandals had seriously tarnished the royal family's image. Cristina, . 49, became the first Spanish royal to be questioned in court since the . monarchy was restored in 1975 when she testified in the case in . February. The decision in the case comes less than a week after Cristina's elder brother, Felipe, (left) was proclaimed king following the abdication of his father Juan Carlos . Commenting on the judge's decision, the Royal Palace would only say it had 'full respect for the independence of the judiciary.' The royal family has lost favour after a series of scandals, including the Noos case, as Spaniards battle economic hardship and high unemployment, though Felipe has distanced himself from his sister and remained untouched by the case. Polls have showed King Juan Carlos' surprise abdication at 76 and his decision to hand over to his 46-year-old son have boosted the monarchy's popularity. Juan Carlos' elephant hunting trip at the height of Spain's financial crisis in 2012 had damaged his standing. Princess Cristina did not attend last week's coronation, and she and Urdangarin have been barred from official royal events since the investigation gathered pace.","Princess Cristina kept on list of suspects judge thinks should stand trial .

"By . John Mcgarry . Worringly, in the recent past, Scottish football enforced an unofficial entry restriction based solely on height. When assessing the impact made by the likes of Andres Iniesta and Xavi for both Barcelona and Spain some years ago, Billy Stark, the current manager of the Scotland under 21s, stated there was every chance that the pair would not have made in it in the Scottish game simply because – at 5ft 7in - neither provided a threat at set pieces. If Stark’s words were a depressing commentary on how prehistoric the Scottish game had become, then we should be thankful that the vast majority of clubs had already long since heeded them and mended their ways. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ryan Gauld nicknamed 'Mini Messi' play for Dundee United . New: Sporting Lisbon and Dundee United reached an agreement over the player Ryan Gauld . Born: Aberdeen, Dec 16 1995 (age 18) 2003-2006: Brechin City BC (youth career) 2006-2012: Dundee United (youth career) 2012-2014: Dundee United (42 apps, 7 gls) 2014-NOW: Sporting CP . 2012-2014: Scotland U19 (10 apps, 2 gls) 2013-NOW: Scotland U21 (1 apps, 0 gls) By the time Spain and Barca were . beginning their domination of international and club football, Dundee . United were one of those who recognised that size was far from . everything. In Ryan Gauld, a former Brechin Boys Club player who came into the Tannadice youth set up in 2006, the Tayside club immediately saw they had a player small in stature but with enormous ability. Brought under the wing of United’s progressive youth supremo Ian Cathro, Gauld’s natural talent was such that he was invariably asked to demonstrate training drills to the assembled hopefuls. There and then, the moniker Mini Messi was his to keep. Long before Peter Houston handed him his debut as a 16-year-old against Motherwell in the final match of season 2011-12, the jungle drums were beating about the 5ft 6in sensation. By the time the following campaign was underway, it was clear for all to see that all the hype was not unjustified. Costly: Gauld has an incredible £48million release clause in his Sporting Lisbon contract . Promise: Sporting Lisbon signed talented teenager Gauld from Dundee United on a six-year contract . VIDEO Gauld inspires Dundee United with four assists . It wasn’t so much Gauld’s ability to ghost away from players at will that caught the eye. Nor was it just his mesmerising ball control. What really stood out was his impeccable decision making in the final third. Time and again, he executed exactly the right pass with exactly the right pace at exactly the right moment. Game intelligence far beyond his tender years. Defenders eliminated left, right and centre. As befits any teenager, there have inevitably been humps in the road over the course of the past couple of seasons. Gauld was virtually unplayable last winter but a sudden loss in form prompted Jackie McNamara, his manager, to send him and team-mate John Souttar off to a sunshine break in Spain. It helped immeasurably. Despite his tender years, Gauld is a player who has always known his own mind. Upon picking up a player of the month award last season, he was inevitably asked about his future intentions. The answer was interesting: Not the predictable move to the Premiership or the Championship but perhaps Spain: Somewhere where he’d get time to play. Sporting Lisbon were clearly hanging on his every word. Wise: Gauld makes excellent decisions on the pitch as much as anything else in his game . In many ways he’s a throwback to the halcyon days of Scottish football when the likes of Jimmy Johnstone tortured hulking defenders. Earlier this year there was a heart-warming tale of a man walking through a Dundee park on afternoon and spotting a handful of kids having a kickabout. They were good. Darned good, in fact. At closer inspection the group revealed themselves to be none other than Gauld and friends enjoying a game on their day off. In the blink of an eye, the one dubbed Mini Messi is a £3m Sporting Lisbon player with a £48m release clause. Thank heavens that height restriction was thrown in the bin. Alike? Gauld has been nicknamed 'Mini Messi' due to similarities in playing style . Next in line? Gauld will hope to follow in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo at Sporting Lisbon .","Ryan Gauld signed for Sporting Lisbon from Dundee United on a six-year contract for £3m deal with a £48m release clause .

"By . Becky Barrow . The taxman was left humiliated last night after being exposed for getting his sums wrong on how much tax was collected. In a damning report, the National Audit Office said HM Revenue and Customs had miscalculated its figures by £1.9billion a year since the coalition Government came to power. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said it was a ‘serious error’ which painted a ‘worrying picture’ of HMRC’s ability to do its job. HM Revenue and Customs had miscalculated its figures by £1.9billion a year since the coalition Government came to power, it has been revealed . She said: ‘If HMRC can’t get its own numbers right, how can it ask the same of others? ‘It is truly depressing that HMRC’s failure to take appropriate action has led to its unwittingly misleading ministers, parliament and the taxpayer.’ Lin Homer, the department’s embattled chief executive, will be grilled by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee next Tuesday to explain the latest disaster. A week later, she faces a second inquisition from MPs on the Public Accounts Committee, a sign of the MP’s concerns about the latest cock-up by the department. The embarrassing mistake comes as HMRC is demanding new powers to be able to raid people’s bank accounts. It wants to be able to take money directly from people’s current accounts, joint accounts or even tax-free Isas in order to settle unpaid tax bills. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said it was a ‘serious error’ Around 17,000 people a year will have money seized under the proposed new powers in a move which has triggered outrage among many accountants. In November 2010, HMRC set itself a target for how much tax it would collect each year. For the next few years, it boasted that it had beaten this target. In fact, it had just got its ‘baseline’ calculation, used to work out whether it had beaten or missed its target, wrong by around £1.9billion a year. The NAO’s report, published yesterday, said: ‘This made the original targets easier to achieve.’ In 2011/12 and 2012/13, HMRC claimed to have beaten its targets by £1.9billion and £2billion respectively. In reality, it had not. The report warns: ‘It is now clear that this apparent over-performance was actually attributable to the baseline error. ‘So HMRC in fact achieved almost exactly the level of performance improvement that was required.’ Mrs Hodge said: ‘The fact HMRC did not know about this serious error in its calculations until the NAO pointed it out paints a worrying picture.’ John O’Connell, director of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, the campaign group, said: ‘It is not surprising people don’t trust the tax system when HMRC is making such basic errors. ‘It’s ludicrous that there could be billion-pound errors in the public finances and it raises fears that the deficit might be even bigger than we think it is. ‘Such mistakes show what folly it would be to allow HMRC direct access to people’s bank accounts, as the coalition government is proposing.’ Recently, HMRC estimated around 3.5million customers paid too much tax in 2013/14 and around two million customers paid too little tax. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, which represents many HMRC workers, said: ‘It is stunning that the department charged with administering the taxes that fund all our other essential public services can’t seem to get its sums right. ‘It is also deeply worrying that, at a time when it is cutting thousands more staff, HMRC is over-egging its level of performance.’ Overall, HMRC collected £506billion in tax in 2013/14, which was £30billion more than it had collected during the previous tax year. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We regret an historic error made in 2011 when we wrongly calculated the baseline against which our performance was measured. ‘We have corrected this error and even against the corrected baseline we have still exceeded our targets. We will work closely with the NAO to prevent this happening again.’","Labour MP Margaret Hodge said HMRC made a ‘serious error’

"By . Jason Groves And John Stevens . Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham has warned that Labour's soft policies on immigration and Europe could cost them the general election . Labour's soft policies on immigration and Europe could cost it the election, a senior member of the Shadow Cabinet has warned. Andy Burnham said voter anger about Labour’s stance on the two issues was a ‘big hurdle’ that could prevent Ed Miliband winning power next year. In a frank intervention, the Shadow Health Secretary said immigration was repeatedly raised on the doorstep – with voters warning that Labour lacked a ‘clear position’. Mr Burnham’s comments came at a conference for the Blairite pressure group Progress, in Manchester. Commenting on the recent elections, he said: ‘I think there is a big hurdle in front of us that we’ve got to be honest about and that is the Labour position on Europe and immigration. That did come up repeatedly on the doorsteps - I had it every single place that I went to. ‘And while we’ve really begun to develop the story coming out of our time in Government that addresses people’s concern there is more to do to give people in the party a simple sense of confidence that Labour has got a clear position.’ Mr Burnham said Labour had to ‘give people policies actually worth voting for… otherwise we will be on a path towards more and more irrelevance’. Mr Miliband has apologised several times for the immigration record of the last Labour government. But he has rejected the Government’s immigration cap and made it clear he will not try to limit the free movement of labour from the European Union. Speaking at a business event in London yesterday Mr Miliband all but ruled out a referendum on Europe – saying a vote would only be held if there is a major transfer of power from Westminster to Brussels. The row over immigration threatened to overshadow a bid by Labour to reach out to the business community, which has been alienated by Mr Miliband’s anti-business rhetoric. The Labour leader told an audience of business executives that he was on a ‘shared mission’ to create prosperity. But he added: ‘I know we won’t always agree on everything. And I won’t just tell you what you want to hear.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured, told an audience of business executives that he was on a 'shared mission' to create prosperity . The attempted charm offensive backfired as business leaders – and some senior Labour figures – said Mr Miliband had to do much more to persuade people he is not anti-business. Former Labour science minister Lord Sainsbury said industry was ‘rightly worried’ about some of the policies and rhetoric emerging from the party. Speaking at the same event, he said: ‘This is an issue that needs to be addressed so that when voters go to cast their votes at the general election they know how each of the main political parties views their relationship with industry and their plans for increasing economic growth. ‘Industry as a whole is rightly worried by policies and organisational changes which can introduce uncertainty and bring activities to a halt for a lengthy period while providing few, if any, benefits.’ Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE, warned the audience, which included shadow chancellor Ed Balls, shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves: ‘Those in power have got to stop the demonisation of business and businessman, and particularly big business.’ 'Those in power have got to stop the demonisation of business and businessmen.' He added: ‘My watch word for politicians is not to lurch back to moods and practices of the past‎ in a misguided belief that it holds the key to future success. Only honing our national competitive edge is going to deliver a sustainable platform for inclusive prosperity.’ Thomas Cook boss Harriet Green said Mr Miliband’s pronouncements on business were ‘marked by interventionism’. ‘What is the strategy to deliver jobs and growth?’ she said. In a further blow, a close friend of Mr Miliband warned he would be a ‘disaster at Number 10’. Jenni Russell, whose child Mr Miliband is godfather to, said he had surrounded himself with a divided and incompetent team who were unable to cover up his ‘weaknesses’. And she warned the Labour leader himself is too inward-looking. Writing in the Times, she said: ‘This strategy might just win Mr Miliband the election but it is a hopeless strategy for government. A leader who can’t inspire confidence, build alliances or enthuse his colleagues will fall apart in Number 10.’","Soft stance on immigration and Europe could cost Labour election, senior party figure warns .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . A former aide of David Cameron's appeared in court today charged with possessing indecent images of children. Patrick Rock, who stood down after being arrested in February, is facing charges of possessing scores of indecent images. He is also accused of ‘making’ indecent photographs of children, which can mean manipulating the images in some way. He was granted bail on condition that he was supported by a 'welfare officer' appointed by his 'previous employer', Westminster magistrates were told. But Downing Street tonight insisted they had not appointed a welfare officer for the 63-year-old former Number 10 aide. Former Downing Street adviser Patrick Rock, arriving at Westminster magistrates' court today, is charged with possessing 61 indecent images of children . Rock's trial is an embarrassment for Downing Street as he was heavily involved in drawing up Government policy on filters designed to block vile images of child abuse. He was arrested at his flat in Fulham, west London, on February 13 after suspicious colleagues called in police. Today, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard that the alleged offending occurred in the United States and that 62 indecent images were found on an iPad in North Carolina. The images are all at the lowest Category C level meaning they showed children alone, it is alleged. Rock today only spoke to confirm his name, date of birth and address. The court heard that police and his former colleagues had concerns about his welfare and 'it was deemed appropriate that, for his own welfare, he needed to have contact with his own welfare officer'. Mr Rock was a special advisor to the Prime Minister David Cameron . Christine Agnew, defending Rock, said that 'a specific welfare officer has been appointed at Mr Rock’s previous place of work' - Downing Street. Rock was formerly deputy director of the Downing Street policy unit and one of Mr Cameron’s closest confidantes. The two men have known each other for two decades and worked side by side for Michael Howard when he was Home Secretary in the 1990s. Officers from the NCA – known as Britain’s FBI – searched his office and removed his laptop and other computer equipment. Rock was bailed to return to Southwark crown court on July 17. Under his bail conditions, Rock must surrender his passport to police, reside at his home address in Fulham, west London, and maintain contact with a welfare officer. The offence of making indecent images of children carries a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment under section 1 of the Protection of Children Act 1978. Possessing child abuse images has a statutory maximum of five years' imprisonment under section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. In a statement last week Judith Reed, a senior lawyer with the CPS organised crime division, said: 'The decision to prosecute has been taken in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors. 'We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest. 'May I remind all concerned that Mr Rock has a right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.' Mr Rock was one of David Cameron's closest aidea. The pair have known each other for 20 years and worked together in Number 10 .

"By . Ian Drury . 'Cause of amusement': Captain Susie King in her 'unflattering' army uniform . Finding flattering maternity wear is often an uphill battle. So spare a thought for Britain’s military mums-to-be who are up in arms about the Army’s uniform for pregnant soldiers. Standard-issue maternity kit, which dates back almost to the Cold War, has been blasted for being more Ministry of Defence than Mothercare, and condemned as poor quality, unprofessional and badly fitting. The criticism has prompted top brass to order a review into modernising uniforms for female troops with a baby bump. Despite being forced to cut thousands of troops and equipment to save money, military chiefs will spend hundreds of thousands of pounds designing and introducing the new fatigues. It is the latest move by the Ministry of Defence to ensure the military is ‘inclusive’ and does not discriminate against service personnel – but it runs the risk of charges of political correctness. Pregnant troops in the Army are currently issued long-sleeved blouses, pregnancy trousers with an elasticated waist, an unstylish beige maternity dress and a cardigan. Captain Susie King, who serves in the Royal Signals, highlighted the problem in the latest issue of Soldier, the Army’s magazine. She said: ‘As a pregnant woman trying to work right up until my due date I’m shocked at how poor the Army’s maternity wear is. ‘I have spent the last eight months switching between clothing as my bump grew. I initially went down the route of getting larger and larger sizes of standard shirt and trousers. ‘I then tailored my slacks myself using elastic panels so that I didn’t have to wear a pair that swamped me in other areas. ‘However, a couple of months ago this no longer sufficed.’ ‘I switched to the issued maternity trousers but when I wore them for a whole day their elastic panel gradually lost its strength and they had a habit of suddenly falling to the floor. ‘My last option was the unstylish beige maternity dress, worn with beret cardigan and brown lace up shoes. ‘It’s fair to say the look this creates has generated a fair amount of amusement among my colleagues. ‘It’s not really a laughing matter when pregnant serving women are being denied the opportunity to look professional in the workplace. ‘Can’t we be supplied with smart maternity garments that look and work as well as the standard versions?’ Lieutenant Colonel Simon Blake, in charge of logistic support at Army Headquarters, said maternity wear was ‘under scrutiny’ and were set to be modernised now troops were withdrawing from Afghanistan. He said: ‘The view is that although the range of clothing is sufficient its design is dated and its functionality can be improved. ‘MoD uniform acquisition has been focused on operational requirements in the last few years with combat garments and high profile parade and ceremonial uniforms understandably being the top priorities. ‘As the Army returns to contingency we are looking more at workwear appearance and it’s hoped this will include the maternity uniforms.’ The Ministry of Defence said the move is to ensure that the military is inclusive and does not discriminate . Earlier this year, the Mail revealed that more than 200 servicewomen have been sent home from war zones after discovering they were pregnant. An astonishing 99 were evacuated from Afghanistan and 102 from Iraq under strict rules that ban mothers-to-be from serving on the front line. Commanders ordered them to return to Britain - sometimes on flights reserved for injured troops - as soon as their condition became known. The Ministry of Defence routinely orders around 1,000 maternity uniforms a year. According to the latest MoD figures, around 15,800 women serve in the Armed Forces – about 9.9 per cent of the total. For the Army, there are nearly 8.000 female service personnel – 8.7 per cent. At any one time around 500 to 600 women have been posted to Afghanistan and in the last eight years around 7,000 have served in Helmand. No women are deployed in the units where the primary role is to ‘close with and kill’ the enemy, or to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. It means they are barred from all infantry battalions, tank regiments, the Royal Marine Commandos and Special Forces. But female servicemen do go out on patrol with combat units and risk firefights while doing supporting roles such as medics, intelligence specialists, artillery spotters, logisticians or signallers. Until August 1990, servicewomen could be sacked for becoming pregnant. In that year, the Armed Forces were no longer excluded from equality laws. It is thought more than £50million has been paid in compensation to 3,500 former servicewomen who were unfairly dismissed. An MoD spokesperson said: ‘All three services offer maternity clothing which are designed in consultation with our female personnel. 'The current designs are from 2004 and we regularly review them to ensure they meet the requirements.’","Military chiefs will spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on new fatigues .

"By . Mark Duell . A five-year-old girl saved her mother’s life by dragging her unconscious from a smoked-filled kitchen. Epilepsy sufferer Auburn Reader, 23, had a seizure and fell to the floor while she was cooking pasta, starting a blaze at her £60,000 semi-detached house in Fochriw, near Merthyr Tydfil in Wales. Also in the home were Miss Reader’s daughter Paige, five, and her best friend Olivia Davies, nine, who smelt smoke, raced downstairs and pulled her away from the flames before raising the alarm. Heroic: Mother Auburn Reader (right), 23, of Fochriw, Wales was rescued by her daughter, Paige (centre), five, and her best friend, Olivia (left), nine, after she collapsed in her kitchen which had caught fire . Miss Reader said: ‘They did pretty much save my life. I was cleaning the kitchen and boiling some pasta. I had accidentally dropped something onto the worktop. ‘I used the tea towel to dry it and I saw the pasta burning. I could feel a seizure coming on and put the tea towel on the side next to the cooker.’ She believes that the tea towel was hanging over the hob and caught fire, adding: ‘It was so quick I didn’t have enough time to get into the living room - it just happened there in the kitchen.’ Her seizures last between two to three minutes but can be quite violent and are caused by a variety of events. She was once having about 12 fits a day - but they now usually happen once a month. Quick thinking: Olivia (left) and Paige (right), both pupils at Fochriw Primary School, could hear Miss Reader having a seizure and smelt smoke. The girls rushed downstairs to find her unconscious on the kitchen floor . Upstairs, Paige and Olivia, both pupils at Fochriw Primary School, could hear her having a seizure and smelt smoke. The girls rushed downstairs to find Miss Reader unconscious on the kitchen floor. Paige and Olivia dragged Miss Reader away from the flames, pulling her almost into the living room. Olivia then picked up the phone and called her mother - Auburn’s best friend - Mary-Ellen Davies. 'If they hadn’t worked together, I could have died' Auburn Reader . Mrs Davies, 30, said: ‘All I could hear was, “Mum, there’s a fire, come and help” but she was so panic-stricken that it was more of a scream.’ As Olivia rang ahead, Paige went outside to get help. Mrs Davies added: ‘From my house, I can see where Auburn lives. I could see Paige running out of the front door and down the garden path.’ Mrs Davies rushed to her friend’s house, where Paige pleaded with her to ‘help mummy’. Location: The incident happened while Miss Reader was cooking pasta in the kitchen of her £60,000 semi-detached house on this road in Fochriw, near Merthyr Tydfil in Wales . Teamwork: Olivia (centre left), Paige (centre right) and Miss Reader (right) are pictured with Mary-Ellen Davies (left), Olivia's mother and Miss Reader's best friend, who lives nearby . Mrs Davies told Paige to stay outside the house while she went inside, turning off the gas, but Paige followed anyway. Inside, Olivia was lying next to Miss Reader between the kitchen and living room doorway. Mrs Davies said: ‘Olivia wouldn’t move from Auburn’s side even though there was a fire in the kitchen.’ 'Mum, there's a fire, come and help' What Paige Reader's friend Olivia Davies told her mother on the phone . As Mrs Davies went to tackle the blaze, Paige and Olivia began to drag Miss Reader out of the house. Mrs Davies said: ‘Auburn was a dead weight after fitting. I helped them out on to the front doorstep and I asked them not to leave Auburn’s side.’ However, Olivia went around the house, opening windows to clear the smoke throughout the house, as Mrs Davies put out the fire.

"By . Suzannah Hills . and Lucy Osborne . A christian teacher claims she was forced out of a controversial Islamic school after being put under pressure to follow an extreme Muslim dress code. Women employees at the Al-Madinah free school were ordered not just to wear the hijab – scarf – to cover their head, but to cover the entire body and not wear symbols of other faiths. The 50-year-old teacher has revealed the full list of rules she was made to adhere to, condemning the school for being ‘more concerned about dress codes and not putting the children’s education first’. The Derby school drew criticism last week for its policy of sitting girls at the back of classrooms. Former teachers say reading fairy tales, playing musical instruments and singing are all banned. Statement: The school, pictured, has posted a letter to parents on its website claiming no staff members have ever raised concerns about the dress code . The Christian teacher, who does not wish to be named, started work there when it opened as a multi-faith free school a year ago but left three months later after she felt the rules had become too ‘strict’. She said she was told nothing about a dress code in her interview or contract, but a month after she started the dress code handbook was distributed. She started by wearing a head scarf or small hat, but took it off after classes, for which she was reprimanded. Shortly after that she began being ‘hassled’ about the rest of her clothing and, on one occasion, was sent a text from the school saying it ‘insisted’ on a ‘modest dress code’. She said she asked how her outfit – a business suit – was not modest and wrote to the head teacher saying she has always dressed in a professional manner. ‘The skirt was well below the knee and I wore thick black tights that covered my legs,’ she said. The teacher has revealed how she was forced to resign after refusing to comply with a strict school dress code insisting all female staff wear hijabs regardless of their religion. She said: 'It wasn’t until an . induction session, just before the school opened, that female non-Muslim . staff were told they must wear a head covering, which was not made . clear at any time during my interview for the job or was part of any . contract. 'I reluctantly . complied and either wore a head scarf or small hat, but took it off when . I wasn’t in the classroom, but for which I was reprimanded. 'Wearing the head covering was difficult for me because I am a Christian and had I known it was compulsory for non-Muslim staff I would never have accepted the position.' The teacher, who does not want to be . named, said she was even sent a text from the school saying it 'insisted . on' a 'modest dress code. Full length dress or skirt acceptable'. She said she asked how her outfit - a . business suit - was not modest. 'The skirt was well below the knee and I . wore thick black tights that covered my legs', she said. The . teacher told how she was offended at the suggestion her clothes were . 'immodest' and was left particularly angry after being was told to take . instructions from two male teachers about what was considered 'modest'. She said: 'I wrote back to the head pointed out that ""in nearly 20 years in teaching, I have always dressed in a professional manner"".' She claims the dress code was issued in a handbook to staff in October 2012 - just one month after the school opened. The book indicated that female staff should only have their faces and hands uncovered when in the school. She said: 'In the interim, I had expressed my concerns to the school about being forced to wear Muslim dress but as there did not seem to be any leeway, I went on sick leave as advised by my union. Strict: A former teacher at the Al-Madinah School in Derby, pictured above, has revealed how she was forced to quit her job because she wouldn't adhere to a Quran-quoting dress code issued to staff . 'The school then put me on ""gardening leave"" and I eventually left in December. 'I am extremely disappointed by my experience. The school seems to me more concerned about dress codes and not putting the children’s education first. 'I also objected to the school’s policy of sitting girls at the back of classrooms, to no avail. The reason given was that girls are allowed to look at boys but the boys are not allowed to look at the girls, but how can that be good for the children’s education? 'I am disappointed that the school does not appear to be the multi-faith school I was excited about joining. I felt oppressed, faced with prejudice and marginalised. I also missed opportunities to take other jobs because I accepted this one. 'I have written and spoken to the Department for Education to complain about what has been happening at the school, and specifically about my experience, and am awaiting a response.' The Daily Mail revealed on Monday that, following a series of complaints, Ofsted inspectors are to be sent to Al-Madinah ‘within days’ to scrutinise the quality of teaching and leadership. This follows reports last week that former head teacher Andrew Cutts-McKay resigned from his role after alleging he was ‘bullied and sidelined’ by members of the school’s trust, which is predominately Muslim. Two months earlier the deputy head, Suzanne Sutherland also stepped down, allegedly citing similar reasons. The school strongly denies their claims. Another former teacher who spoke anonymously to the Mail said the school ‘was like being in Pakistan’ adding: ‘Boys go and eat lunch first at lunchtime and then the girls are allowed to go.’ And one woman interviewed for a position claimed she was told she was not allowed to shake hands with male teachers. The school declined to comment. In a letter to parents published on the school's website, the interim Principle Dr G S Wilson said: 'There has been a suggestion that female members of staff are unhappy to wear a headscarf or hijab when they are on the school site. 'In all our adverts, and whenever we interview candidates, we draw their attention to our dress code, which we have based on our interpretation of modesty within our unique Free School environment. To date, the school has not received a single concern from colleagues about this issue. 'It has also been suggested that girls are treated in a way that implies they are not equal to boys. This is totally wrong. In Primary, boys and girls have never been segregated either inside or outside the classroom. 'In Secondary, girls are seated as a group, either at one side of the classroom, or alternately at the front or the back of the room, swapping over from time to time. Our intention is to respect both genders equally. These seating arrangements have been determined purely by practicalities such as the size of the classroom.' It is already being investigated by the Education Funding Agency, from which it receives public money, over alleged irregularities over its grants. It has already been given £1.4 million and can expect to receive more to spend on a new building. Now it is expected that officials from the Office for Standards in Education will inspect the school within days following the furore over the dress code claims and concerns by unions over the standards of education at the school. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'These allegations are very worrying. We have already been investigating this school for other reasons. 'Ofsted was due to inspect it this term and after discussions will bring forward its inspection. 'The DfE will not hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to prevent religious intolerance or any breaking of the rules for free schools.' Rules: The strict dress code issued to teachers at Al-Madinah School in Derby quotes the Quran (stock image pictured) Al-Madinah is an Islamic Free school. Within the school we value and esteem our teachers and consider them to . be strong role models for all of the students and representatives of the . school with all external individuals and organisations. We wish to . create an Islamic environment within the school for the sake of the . students and to cater for the sensitivities of the community. Although . some of the following points are not Islamically-binding upon all . individuals except those who wish to adhere to the faith by choice, . Al-Madinah School has adopted them as a code of dress for all teachers. The code of dress for teachers has been . adopted by the school and all teachers must adhere to it. By signing the . contract of employment with Al-Madinah school all employees agree to . adhere to this policy. 1. Clothing must cover the entire body, only the hands, face and feet may remain visible. 2. The material must not be so thin that one can see through it. 3. The clothing must hang loose so that the shape of the body is not apparent. 4. The design of the clothing must not display any symbols of other faiths. 5. All clothing must be full sleeved and all lower body garments must be loose and covering to the ankles. 6. Skirts must be ankle length and must be loose and flowing. 7. Teachers should not wear overt jewellery or clothing accessories. 8. Wearing of the Niqab or Burqa during work hours is not permitted. Allah has stated in the Quran that women . must guard their modesty. 'Say to the believing women that they should . lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display . their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear thereof.' (Quran: 24.31) 'Say to the believing man that they . should lower their gaze and guard their modesty that will make for . greater purity for them, and God is well acquainted with all they do.'

"By . Chris Greenwood . Support: Patrick Rock, 63, pictured arrving at Westminster magistrates' court yesterday, was assigned a welfare officer after his arrest . A former adviser to David Cameron accused of possessing indecent images of children is still being supported by Downing Street, a court heard yesterday. Patrick Rock, 63, was assigned a welfare officer by No 10 when his arrest led to his resignation from a role at the heart of Government four months ago. He appeared at Westminster magistrates’ court in London even though no evidence against him was found on British soil. He was held at his sister’s home in the US state of North Carolina. The court was told he had 59 indecent images of children on an iPad. District Judge John Zani ordered Rock, from Fulham, West London, to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court later this month. He was released on bail with a number of conditions, including that he maintain contact with the Downing Street-appointed welfare officer. He was also told to surrender his passport. Rock was arrested in February by the National Crime Agency, but the investigation was made public only when it was revealed by this newspaper. The secrecy remains unexplained. Rock, ex-deputy director of the Downing Street policy unit and a protege of Margaret Thatcher, was one of Mr Cameron’s closest confidants. He worked for Michael Howard when he was Home Secretary in the 1990s and was involved in drawing up government policy on filters designed to block images of child abuse. The crimes are alleged to have taken place between July 31 and August 31 last year. Mr Rock, deputy director of the Downing Street policy unit and a protege of Margaret Thatcher, was one of Mr Cameron’s closest confidantes. The two men were close for two decades and worked for Michael Howard when he was Home Secretary in the 1990s. The public servant was involved in drawing up Government policy on filters designed to block vile images of child abuse. And his seniority was demonstrated by the fact that he was one of only three advisers given his own private office in No 10. According to official guidelines, people convicted of possessing category C indecent images are likely to receive a community penalty. Rock was arrested by the National Crime Agency (NCA) in February after he was accused of being in possession of indecent images on his iPad .

Double World Cup winner Ronaldo is certain coach Luiz Felipe Scolari 'will change something' to reawaken Brazil's attack in Friday's World Cup quarter-final match against Colombia. 'We are waiting for a good performance by Brazil. We are not playing well. I am disappointed with the first four matches,' said Ronaldo, the joint-leading World Cup goal-scorer of all time. 'I think he (Scolari) will change something. I don't know what.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brazil legend Ronaldo: Scolari needs to change something . Talking tactics: Scolari (centre) chats to his players in training earlier this week . Been there, done it: Ronaldo lifts the World Cup in 2002 with Scolari (back right) watching on . There has been much speculation that right back Dani Alves and striker Fred are in danger of being cut from the starting line-up. One player who will certainly be missing is defensive midfielder Luis Gustavo, who picked up a second yellow card and is suspended. Paulinho, who started the first three group games before being replaced by Fernandinho, is a candidate to return to the starting line-up. Strikers Fred and Jo have between them netted just one of the eight goals scored by Brazil in the tournament so far. Like many of his countrymen, Ronaldo sees this faltering strike force as an area of concern. Misfiring: Brazil striker Fred has not impressed so far leading the line at the World Cup . VIDEO Fully fit Neymar points to Ronaldo inspiration . 'They aren't playing well. There are no secrets, my advice is to run a lot and try and score as much as you can,' he said. 'But it's not easy to play like a No 9, even if you have Neymar playing with you.' Ronaldo can probably understand the pressure that is on the 22-year-old Neymar. Ronaldo was famously hit by a mysterious illness on the day of the 1998 World Cup final, with many blaming it on the pressure the then 21-year-old forward was facing. But he thinks Neymar, who has scored four goals so far in the tournament, can handle the expectations of the host nation. 'He's like a kid, he's just thinking about playing well and scoring goals,' Ronaldo said. 'He is very calm, very relaxed. He is as good as any young player.'","Brazil face Colombia in World Cup quarter-final on Friday .

"By . Corey Charlton . These are the first behind-the-scenes pictures of Morph being re-created 37 years on - as the animated star returns to our screens tomorrow. Animators at Aardman Animations in Bristol have spent five months creating 15 episodes using 150 clay models. Remarkably, the team have used the original ‘Morph scales’ which ensure each model contains exactly 162g of clay to create the perfect figurine. Scroll down for video . These are brand new photos taken during the production of the new Morph series to be released tomorrow . Peter Lord, the creator of Morph, with his plasticine star character in the company's Bristol studios . The new episodes of Morph went into production after a kickstarter campaign raised more than £110,000 . The first episode of the new series will air on Morph’s YouTube channel at 5.15pm tomorrow - the exact time the character first appeared on BBC1 on February 15, 1977. In truly modern fashion, the comeback was made possible by a crowdfunding campaign which raised £110,000 from 2,500 fans in a month to fund the new animations. Morph was first created in 1977 at the hands of Peter Lord, and was famed for its clever use of plasticine stop motion animation. This method involved moving the model in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the appearance of movement when the frames were played back-to-back at high speed. Morph first hit TV screens in 1977 and appeared in one minute 'shorts' interspersed throughout children's TV shows presented by Tony Hart. The character was known for living in a box, and was later joined by a white-coloured friend called Chas, allowing the two to interact. They often changed shape completely, and could be rolled, squished or bent into various shapes. While the original show was axed in 1997, there were several small Morph scenes created over following years before Mr Lord's recent kickstarter campaign funded a whole new series. Mr Lord and the creators also went on to find fame for their Academy Award winning Wallace and Gromit films and TV series. The series has been produced using . the same traditional animation techniques used in the original series, . which was axed in 1997. The films were shot in the same studio as the original programmes with the same painstaking stop-frame animation and hand sculpting tools. Co-founder of Aardman, Peter Lord: 'Morph is one of the first characters we created and we all love him at Aardman! 'I’m . amazed and humbled that even though it has been close to 40 years since . his creation, the little guy still has such a passionate following, . especially on Facebook and YouTube. 'We’ve . had so many people over the years asking for him to make a comeback and . it’s been hugely exciting to work with his fans to bring Morph back in . some brand new short films which we will release online for everyone to . enjoy.' As . well as Morph’s new episodes, the character will also be used to . introduce the programme ‘See Hear’, a show created with deaf or visibly . impaired children in mind. There . was an issue as to whether Morph was up to the task, as although he has . a thumb, his fingers are merged together, limiting the amount he can . sign. Luckily he can sign 'Hello and welcome to See Hear', so will introduce the show on Wednesday 18th June on BBC 2.

As Kincade - who has no use of his legs and is confined to a motorized wheelchair - tries to motor around Davidson, who is standing in the way of his wheelchair, he appears to bump the officer's foot. At that point, Davidson is clearly seen violently pushing the disabled man out of his wheelchair and onto the street. 'What the f***,' the shaken Kincade yelled after the officer pushes him to the pavement. Kincade was then arrested for battery on a police officer after he was taken away from the scene on a stretcher. The unfortunate incident occurred near the Excel School, where police were called by school staff after Kincade allegedly told them he had a gun in his backpack. Free to go: Kincade was free to go, but Davidson stood directly in his path as he tried to carry on . Help: Because he can't walk, the officers were forced to help the disabled man up before arresting him . The responding officers, including Davidson, quickly determined that Kincade didn't have a gun. At the request of the school, the officers issued Kincade a warning to not trespass on school property, and then he should have been free to go. Davidson - who was standing directly in Kincade's way after he was supposedly free to carry on - had other plans, and toppled Kincade without warning when his wheelchair grazed the officer's foot. Following the incident, Davidson was put on administrative leave as the department did an internal investigation of the incident, according to TurnTo23.com. The investigation concluded that Davidson violated the department's rules regarding 'unbecoming conduct' and 'response to resistance.' The officers who conducted the investigation recommended that Davidson be fired. 'It was just inappropriate,' Lafayette Police Chief Patrick  Flannelly, who recommended that Davidson be fired, told the Lafayette Journal and Courier. Assistance: Kincade needed to be taken off on a stretcher after he was pushed . Disruption: Police were called to this charter school after Kincade told school staff that he had a gun . Making it more disconcerting, he continued, was the fact that Davidson was the highest ranking officer at the scene. But Flannelly doesn't make hiring and firing decisions about officers in his department. That's a job for the Lafayette Police Civil Service Commission, 'which is made up of five . Lafayette citizens who vote on decisions about LPD hiring, promotions . and discipline,' as described by TurnTo23.com. The Commissioner found that 'Davidson had engaged in conduct unbecoming an officer. They disagreed, . however, on the second charge brought against him, voting 3-2 that his . use of force in response to resistance was in line with LPD policies.' Rather than termination, the Commission opted to strip Davidson of his rank, as well as serve a 30-day unpaid suspension and one year probation. The prosecutor announced Monday that no charges would be filed against Davidson or Kincade stemming from the incident.","Indiana Lieutenant Tom Davidson was caught on film pushing Nicholas Kincade from his wheelchair .

"By . Jens Lehmann . The World Cup quarter-final and semi-final in 2006 were two of the biggest games of my career. I loved performing on the biggest stage as I knew I was a better goalkeeper under pressure. They are the matches when you know you have to deliver; that you must not fail. That is the case for France’s Hugo Lloris and Germany’s Manuel Neuer on Friday night. They, like me, will probably be nervous before the game but then the whistle blows and it is back to delivering. It’s a bigger challenge for Lloris than Neuer, as he has played fewer high-level games but the battle will be fascinating. I’ll be supporting Germany, of course, but I have taken emotion out of it for this critical assessment of the two players. Scroll down to see Manuel Neuer highlights for Germany . Top of the Stops: Goalkeepers Hugo Lloris and Manuel Neuer go hjead-to-head on Friday night . Penalty heroics: Jens Lehmann helped Germany to the World Cup semi-finals on home soil in 2006 . MENTAL STRENGTH . LLORIS: He still has to prove his mental strength. With Tottenham, every time when it mattered, the team didn’t perform. And he hasn’t had many big challenges yet for France. But one big performance in a big game can make you a different player. You learn so much in these matches. NEUER: He’s mentally very strong because he’s been successful for such a big club in Bayern. You saw that in the Algeria game, where he came out of his box so many times. His timing was perfect and it shows real mental strength to act rather than react. Something to prove: Lloris is yet to face a big challenge so far at this summer's tournament in Brazil . SHOT STOPPING . LLORIS: He is very good and agile. The only thing that  worries me is that his arms are skinny, like a lot of keepers these days. That has changed from my day and not for the better. NEUER: He has better, stronger arms. It can be the difference between clawing a ball off the line or it going in. The stronger your arms, the more likely you are to save powerful shots. Brick wall: Neuer has strong arms making it more likely for him to save powerful shots at goal . DISTRIBUTION . LLORIS: He is left-footed and distributes well. He is very precise and better with that foot that Neuer is with either of his. NEUER: The German’s huge advantage is that he kicks with both feet and his distribution from his hands is the best in the world. Go long! Neuer is capable of using both feet while Lloris is particularly precise with his left foot . PRESENCE IN THE AREA . LLORIS: He’s 6ft 2in but because he is skinny, he does not have a great presence. You often have to decide at the last second whether to punch or catch the ball but you need strong arms to be able to punch with both. NEUER: He could come more often for crosses because his huge frame makes him a big presence and he can dominate. Flying high: Lloris climbs highest to punch the ball clear during France's last-16 victory over Nigeria . PENALTY SHOOTOUTS . LLORIS: I can rarely remember a shorter goalkeeper winning a shootout against a taller one. And of his 22 penalties faced in the past few years, he has saved only two. I won a shootout against Argentina in 2006 and two things were vital: the information I had on my opponents’ habits and timing my jump in the split second when it was obvious the taker could no longer change direction. NEUER: He lost the Champions League final against Chelsea - Germans are not supposed to lose penalty shootouts, I can say that as a German! But his armspan covers almost two thirds of the goal and he has saved 33 per cent of kicks since 2009 . Success: Chelsea may have got the better of Neuer but the German has saved 33 per cent of kicks since 2009 . KEEPER SWEEPER . LLORIS: He is very quick off his line. He gets down to balls quickly because he’s not that tall and is very agile. When I failed to make a save, I used to wish I was smaller but I was wrong - making saves is just a small part of what you have to do as a keeper. NEUER: Showed against Algeria what he can do and has proved it again and again at a high level. Sweeper Keeper: Neuer had to come to the aid of his back four during Germany's extra-time win over Algeria . VERDICT . Lloris wants to play at the top level, Neuer already does. This match-up is a man who is good against a man who is top-class.

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . As the tremors from Grigor Dimitrov’s earth-shattering defeat of Andy Murray began to fade on Thursday, we were left to wonder whether the tectonic plates of men’s tennis still had further to shift. Can this 23-year-old Bulgarian break new ground and beat another one of the Big Four? Novak Djokovic will hope the answer is no on Friday and the Serb certainly has experience on his side. Dreamland: Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov celebrates beating defending Wimbledon champion Andy Murray . In control: Dimitov started far faster than Murray and never looked like letting his early lead slip . While this is Dimitrov’s debut in a Grand Slam semi-final, Djokovic has been in 23, winning on 13 occasions. He lifted the title here in 2011, entered the tournament as No 1 seed, and has career earnings topping $62million, essentially everything to which Dimitrov aspires. Such gold and silver might not be far away. The Murray win cemented Dimitrov’s status from promising youth to serious contender, following on from his victory at Queen’s last month. He is laying foundations and toppling Djokovic will add another level. Going the distance: Djokovic needed five sets to beat Marin Cilic in the quarter-finals . On the slide: Djokovic had trouble with his footing against Cilic and switched his footwear during the match . Dimitrov’s respected coach Roger Rasheed said: ‘He’s got more than a chance. I’ve got no ceiling on what Grigor can do. ‘What a great challenge it is for him, but also for Novak. He is not going to walk out on court thinking he’s got this semi-final in the bag. We’re expecting a match of high intensity with a lot of good quality tennis.’ Dimitrov’s rise can be traced back to the appointment of Rasheed last October and the coach  added: ‘At the start we spoke about how I was going to navigate him through a Grand Slam. ‘It’s about how you treat these off-days. During our practice sessions there are a few little things we pick up on. The rest is about being fresh and letting  your mind recover ready for the battle.’ Making him work: Dimitov smashes an athletic winner during his fine victory against Murray . Sorted: Dimitrov salutes the Centre Court crowd after beating their favourite son in the quarter-final . Djokovic leads Dimitrov 3-1 in previous encounters, winning their last one in straight sets at the French Open in 2013. But Djokovic knows that the player he faces today is a different proposition. ‘His game has improved a lot,’ said the five-times major champion. ‘The fact that he hasn’t lost a match in the grasscourt season this year says enough about his quality — also winning against Andy. ‘I’m sure many people look at him as a potential Grand Slam winner. Maybe here, maybe in the Grand Slams to follow.’","The 23-year-old looked comfortable during his win against Murray .

"By . Andrew Dampf . The best is yet to come from Germany. That was the promise, at least, from coach Joachim Low ahead of Friday's World Cup quarter-final against France at the Maracana Stadium. While Germany looked impressive in a 4-0 win over Portugal in its opening match, the three-time champions struggled in their next games, being held to a 2-2 draw by Ghana, edging the United States 1-0 and needing extra time to beat Algeria 2-1. Still, Germany are contesting their ninth straight World Cup quarter-final. Final preparations: Philipp Lahm, Joachim Low and Toni Kroos of Germany look on during a training session . Tough test: Low was speaking ahead of Germany's quarter-final clash with France on Friday . 'We have not yet delivered our best possible performance,' Low said on Thursday. 'But I don't think anyone has reached their absolute top performance yet. 'It's not a computer game that is easily figured out - You can't easily figure out your opponent and it's not easy to program your own team. Mistakes are made. ... And then there are other elements from beyond the pitch.' An element such as this: seven Germany players have been struggling with illness. 'One-third of our squad has been complaining about a sore throat,' Loew said. 'But Wednesday and Thursday all players have been training and none were feeling exhaustion. I just hope that stays stable until Friday.' Germany played its group matches in the warmer, northeastern climates of Salvador, Fortaleza and Recife then faced Algeria in the second round in cool and damp conditions in the southern city of Porto Alegre. Seal skills: Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng balances a ball on his head during training . Care free: Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira seemed to be enjoying themselves at the Maracana . VIDEO Team Profile: Germany highlights . 'Perhaps they got contaminated from others, or maybe it was the difference in temperatures, or the air conditioning,' Low said. Center back Mats Hummels missed the Algeria game due to illness but Loew indicated he'll be back against France. Likewise, midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger is expected to return from severe cramps after being substituted against Algeria. The only Germany player ruled out is defender Shkodran Mustafi, who will miss the rest of the tournament with a left hamstring injury. Against Algeria, Germany struggled when it lost possession and Algeria put together swift counter-attacks. Under control: Seven Germany players have been struggling with illness throughout the week . On the ball: Bastian Schweinsteiger, Miroslav Klose of Germany prepare for the quarter-final at Estadio Maracana . 'I think this kind of match is decided in midfield. If we can dominate there it will say a lot in terms of achieving a positive result,' midfielder Toni Kroos said. 'Our style of play is to keep the ball on the ground and we have many players that are very good at that. We need to have more precise passes and have better concentration. That's our match philosophy.' While France is aiming to exceed expectations, Germany had loftier goals from the start. 'They want us to get the title,' Kroos said.

Sunday has been designated ‘Pink For Papa’ day as it marks the McLaren driver’s first trip to Silverstone without his dad John, who passed away in January this year. John Button played a key role in Jenson’s career, only missing one of his son’s races in 14 seasons prior to his death. Pink for Papa: Jenson and his stunning fiancee Jessica pose in the special pink shirts which are on sale to raise money for charity . Close bond: Jenson Button with his late father John who used to wear a 'lucky' pink shirt on race-day . And the McLaren star has is asking fans to show their support by going pink – the colour of John’s traditional ‘lucky’ race-day shirt. McLaren have created a special T-shirt which supporters can buy, with proceeds going to the Henry Surtees Foundation - an organisation set up by former world champion John Surtees, in memory of his son Henry, which assists and supports people with injuries caused by accidents. Other stars including Jenson’s model fiancée Jessica Michibata, former World Champion Damon Hill and TV presenters Natalie Pinkman, Simon Lazenby and Lee McKenzie have already shown their support by posing in their pink t-shirts. Jenson said: ‘This year will be extra special for me, and probably a little more emotional than normal - it’s normally very emotional anyway because of the support, but it will be more so this year,’ said Button.

He is haunted by the fact that not once in 14 previous attempts in his home race as he managed to finish in the top three and soak up the acclaim of an often fervent support. ‘We won’t get on the podium at Silverstone.

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . Petra Kvitova will lift a ban on her parents attending her matches at Wimbledon, permitting them entry into her player’s box when she takes on Eugenie Bouchard in Saturday’s final. Father Jiri and mother Pavla were in floods of tears alongside Martina Navratilova when she won Wimbledon as a 21-year-old in 2011. It remains her only Grand Slam victory. Strike: Kvitova's serve was almost impregnable during her win against Sarafova . Roar: Kvitova is favourite to win Saturday's final against former junior champion Bouchard . A leftie from the Czech Republic, she inevitably drew comparisons with tennis legend Navratilova, who also won Wimbledon for the first time at 21. With the omens came the expectation and Kvitova, who hails from Fulnek, a small town near the Polish border, admitted she struggled to cope with the spotlight. ‘I won it quite young and it was difficult for me to handle it. I knew that a lot of people expected something more from me than I did,’ she said. ‘But on the other side, I was still in the top 10 and I did everything I could. I was practising very hard but it’s never easy, with everyone talking about us. 'The three years since then have been really up and down. I needed to change a little bit on the court and off the court, to get used to the pressure, the attention and everything like that.’ Disbelief: Kvitova drops to her knees in shock after winning her final against Sharapova in 2011 . Ecstatic: The Czech player kisses the trophy after her straight sets victory over Sharapova . Kvitova, 24, is an unassuming character who was still driving a Skoda a few months after pocketing £1.1million for winning Wimbledon. She has since upgraded to a BMW but has remained with her coach David Kotyza. After criticism of her fitness, she employed a new fitness coach and appeared to cope with the rigours of a three-set thriller against Venus Williams in the third round. ‘That was the match I was most pleased to win,’ she said. ‘I’ll be the favourite in the final and I can cope with that because I think I’ve been the favourite in every match apart from against Venus.’ Kvitova may be grounded but she has a ruthless streak, hugging her compatriot and close friend Lucie Safarova at the net before Thursday’s match, then destroying her from the baseline with brute strength. Fist pump: Bouchard beat Halep in straight sets on Centre Court and will play Kvitova in the final . Dominant: Bouchard has stormed to the final but it is the underdog against Kvitova . Amid talk of the emergence of a new generation of young players, led by Bouchard, Safarova, 27, was making her semi-final debut in her 37th Grand Slam appearance. Kvitova is a proven performer on the biggest stage but world No23 Safarova hung tough in the first set, exposing Kvitova’s limited movement - the most prominent weakness in her game - by sending her around the court and punishing her with a beautiful backhand. Safarova, the Czech No2, fought hard to level the tie-break after going 3-1 down but Kvitova produced two sledgehammer serves to regain the upper hand. Safarova’s challenge melted away after dropping the first set and world No6 Kvitova raced to a 7-6, 6-1 victory. Battle: Safarova took the first set to a tie-break, but was overwhelmed in the second . Czech mate: Kvitova embraces compatriot Safarova after beating her on Centre Court . Kvitova consoled Safarova, whom she trains alongside in Prostejov in the Czech Republic, after the match. ‘It is difficult to play your friend especially because you know them well on and off the court,’ she said. ‘I think we were both nervous and she’s playing such good  tennis at the moment.’ The biggest challenge is yet to come for Kvitova when she faces rising star Bouchard. They have played just once, in Toronto last year when the Czech breezed to victory. ‘She was just coming up then,’ said Kvitova. ‘I find her a very solid and  talented player. She really seems confident in her game right now.’","The 24-year-old is expected to beat rising star Bouchard on Saturday .

Arrested: 25 different baggage handlers hired through a contractor to work at LAX were arrested either at the airport (pictured) or their homes on Wednesday night . Sticky fingers: The investigation into missing luggage had been going on for months . The LAPD chief tasked with leading the operation would not name the contracting company involved. The company had already run criminal and employment background checks on the individuals before hiring them. 'It’s a disappointment, but a fact of life, that sometimes a few people will succumb to the temptations at LAX,' irport police Chief Patrick Gannon told KTLA. 'The actions of these few do not represent the nearly 45,000 individuals who work for the nearly 350 employers at LAX.' Detectives and officers from the Los Angeles and airport police departments served warrants and seized property Wednesday night at 25 different locations, including the airport itself and in Los Angeles-area cities, including Inglewood and Paramount. Crimes: The contracted workers (none of whom were technically airport employees or TSA workers like those pictured) allegedly stole travelers bags or took things from the suitcases . The suspects reportedly both took entire bags and stole from inside luggage after it had been loaded off arriving planes. 'We believe that there has been a culture of being able to take property that wasn't theirs, and that's what we want to be able to put a stop to,'Captain Ray Maltez told KABC-TV. Television news footage showed police raiding airport terminals and leading out several people in handcuffs, many of them wearing yellow reflective safety vests. Most of the police activity was at the Tom Bradley International Terminal and at Terminal 4, which houses American Airlines, American Eagle and some Qantas flights. Police set up a mobile command center and jail near the airport to process those arrested. The raids were first reported by KNBC-TV.","The 25 suspects were all employed by a contractor who ran background checks before allowing them to work at LAX and nearby airports .

'They need to get it into their heads that we can't be ""Sporting Messi'.

In the know: Maradona, pictured here with Gary Lineker, says they are in danger of becoming 'Sporting Messi' Maradona, Argentina's coach at the last World Cup where they went out in the quarter-finals, was speaking on Venezuelan TV after Argentina's defeat of Switzerland this week. His comments were widely reported in Latin American media on Thursday. He said Argentina's big name team were playing at only 40 percent of their capacity and criticized them for only squeaking past Switzerland 1-0 with a last-gasp goal in extra time. 'Man-for-man, and collectively, Argentina are better. They (the Swiss) may make good watches but they have few footballers,' the always controversial Maradona said. Argentina, who were to train behind closed doors on Thursday at their camp in Belo Horizonte before flying to Brasilia for Saturday's game versus Belgium, won all three group games before beating the Swiss in the last 16. Messi has won man-of-the-match in each game, and scored four of Argentina's seven goals. But the wins have all been by one-goal margins and have masked some subdued individual performances by other players expected to make bigger contributions. Adds insult to injury: Maradona also claims Switzerland are better at making watches than playing football . 'The kid (Messi) is very alone ... The team doesn't have a change of rhythm, movements in its strikers,' added Maradona, saying the players lacked a give-it-all attitude. 'I feel something very strong inside, like bitterness, rage, frustration, because Argentina can play much, much better ... The coach has to impose this."" If they do not improve against Belgium, ""we're in trouble,' he said. Argentina have won the World Cup twice and would dearly love to lift it for a third time on the soil of their great rivals Brazil.

Stokes’s inclusion in England’s 13-man squad for Nottingham lends the attack extra spark, and Broad said he liked what he saw in Australia when the Durham all-rounder gave as good as he got. ‘He was 22 and standing up to Brad Haddin in the toughest series he could have possibly played in,’ said Broad. ‘He came out as a shining light. He is the sort of player who can really get in the Indians’ faces. Back: Ben Stokes is back in the England fold after being recalled in a 13-man squad .

Asked what advice he would give Stokes if his frustrations boil over at Trent Bridge, Broad replied: ‘I think they are made from solid wood, so it would be to avoid them!’ Broad was critical of the slowness of the pitches laid out at Lord’s and Headingley for the Sri Lankans, who are used to those conditions at home. ‘There is no excuse for wickets not to have nicks that carry,’ he said. Different ball game: Broad and Bealey Mitchell enjoyed out at Wembley . ‘The amount of nicks that Matt Prior was trying to climb forward for —  I don’t think that is great for the game. I think wickets should be flat, but a fair contest between bat and ball and bowlers should rely on reverse swing and, if it’s cloudy, swing.’ India completed their match preparations on Thursday with a contrived win against Derbyshire, reaching their target of 142 in 45 overs with five wickets and more than eight overs to spare. But there was bad news for Test hopeful Rohit Sharma. After failing to get a bat in the first innings at Derby, he made just 10 before edging left-arm spinner David Wainwright to Wes Durston at slip. All-rounder Stuart Binny could yet come into the equation, especially with Trent Bridge traditionally helping swing bowlers.

"By . Jerome Pugmire, Associated Press . France defender Mamadou Sakho and his teammates will be filled with 'rage' when they take on Germany in their World Cup quarter-final. Not because they have anything personal against the Germans, but because they are still feeling the anger and desperation after barely qualifying for the tournament in Brazil. Sakho has been France's vice captain since the second leg of the World Cup playoffs against Ukraine. With the team trailing 2-0 after a dire performance in Kiev, Sakho scored in a 3-0 win, and his passionate performance sparked a remarkable turnaround. Goal to goal: French players are put through their paces during a training session at the Santa Cruz Stadium . Out of the blocks: Les Bleus carry out some sprint drills on Wednesday afternoon in Ribeirao Preto . Jog on: France face Germany in their quarter-final on Friday night . Ready for action: France defender Mamadou Sakho speaks during Wednesday's press conference in Ribeirao Preto . VIDEO Team Profile: France . Since then, France is unbeaten in eight games and has kept six clean sheets. 'Of . course I still have the rage inside me from that game,' the Liverpool . defender said Wednesday. 'We all have a little bit of that rage inside . of us.' France is vastly . more inexperienced than Germany, which has reached at least the . semifinals of each major competition since the 2008 European . Championship. By contrast, France is rebuilding and has not reached any . semifinal since the 2006 World Cup. But several fresh talents have revamped the national team - which only has two regular starters older than 29. 'We're . a very young team with new players,' Sakho said. 'We've instilled a new . spirit into the team - off the pitch, first of all - and it reflects on . the pitch. 'We know that Germany is a big team, a big football nation,' Sakho added. 'But we're also very good and I believe in us.' At . 24 years old, Sakho is the oldest of France's new generation and has . played 22 times for his country. He was rested against Nigeria after . failing to shake of a left hamstring injury but is fit again to face . Germany on Friday at Maracana Stadium. Besides . Sakho, Paul Pogba has established himself in midfield and Raphael . Varane has done likewise in central defense. Meanwhile, Antoine . Griezmann has confidently replaced winger Franck Ribery, who was injured . before the tournament. Hot shot: Paul Pogba has been one of the standout players in this year's World Cup .

The 33-year-old Evra and 31-year-old Bacary Sagna are the senior players. But unlike before, all the players mingle and there is no generational conflict within the squad. 'Everyone . sits together at the dinner table, there's no difference,' Sakho said. 'After the meal last night eight of us stayed at the table to talk about . football and about life in general. It was brilliant.' Some . change from Euro 2012, when players formed cliques and went straight to . their rooms after finishing their meals. It was even worse at the 2010 . World Cup, where they were united - but only because they went on strike . and refused to train after one of their teammates was sent home. 'I . wasn't part of the old generation, but we really sense that this team . gets on,' Sakho said. 'If you have strong characters things can blow . apart when you're together for one month. We have strong characters in . this team but we're able to control it.' Pogba . scored his first goal of the tournament in Monday's 2-0 win over . Nigeria in the second round, and he's also been making an impression . behind the scenes. 'Paul . really gets the atmosphere going.

Former world 100 metres champion Tyson Gay makes his return from a one-year drugs ban in Lausanne on Thursday night against two US relay team-mates who could yet lose their Olympic medal as a result of his cheating. The men’s 4x100m relay team, including Ryan Bailey and Justin Gatlin, have not been told if they will be stripped of silver from London 2012 after Gay handed back his medal following three positive tests for a banned anabolic steroid last year. Gay admitting to doping from July 2012 but had the standard two-year ban cut to a year after ‘truthfully co-operating’ with authorities. Return: Tyson Gay will make his comeback on Thursday following a drugs ban . Athletics’ world governing body, the IAAF, stipulates the whole team should be disqualified if any athlete fails a drugs test. But the decision lies with the International Olympic Committee, who have yet to decide whether to upgrade Trinidad and Tobago to silver behind champions Jamaica. Gay races Bailey and Gatlin over 100m in Thursday night’s Diamond League meeting, with both men unsure whether they will lose their medals. Bailey, 25, said: ‘Personally I haven’t been told anything so until then it’s my medal and you can’t take it from me.’ In the dark: Ryan Bailey (left) is unsure whether he will be stripped of his medal because Gray cheated . Gatlin, the 2004 100m Olympic champion, served a four-year ban himself after failing his second drugs test in 2006, but dismissed suggestions the race was tarnished by the presence of two former drugs cheats. The 32-year-old said: ‘If we are saying this race should not be happening because of my past discretions then I should not have been at the World Championships or the Olympics. 'And I have no power to say what races Tyson can run in. If he’s here and I line up against him I can’t complain. I’ve just got to go out there and do my job.’ Gatlin said Gay was still a ‘worthy opponent’ at 31 but was vague when asked whether the one-year ban seemed unfairly lenient. He did, however, admit Gay would be feeling the pressure in Lausanne. Speaking from experience: Justin Gatlin was banned for four years for using performance-enhancing drugs . ‘I wish Tyson luck because it can be a stressful time, not only on the track but in how people think  about you and how they look at you,’ said Gatlin. ‘It’s probably going to  be with him for the rest  of his career.’ Gatlin is targeting Yohan Blake’s 2012 meeting record of 9.69sec —  a time which doubles as Gay’s USA record — while Great Britain’s James Dasaolu will only have eyes on the clock when he opens his season in the B race. His needs to run 10.20sec, the qualifying time to make the British team for the European Championships in Zurich next month.","Former world 100 metres champion to make comeback in Lausanne .

"By . David Kent . Galatasaray have begun talks with former Italy coach Cesare Prandelli to become their next manager, the Turkish side announced on Thursday. The Istanbul outfit, who last week revealed they had held an 'exchange of ideas' with former Manchester United manager David Moyes, are looking for a new coach after parting company with Italian tactician Roberto Mancini last month. Prandelli resigned as Italy coach last week after the national team's 1-0 defeat to Uruguay at the World Cup that saw them exit the competition early.

A statement from Galatasaray read: 'Galatasaray Sportif has announced that they have begun negotiating with the Italian football manager Cesare Prandelli. 'The public will be updated about further developments.' The 56-year-old Prandelli, who had two years left in his contract with the Italian football federation, guided Roma and Fiorentina before replacing Marcello Lippi at the helm of Italy in 2010. He led the Azzurri to finish runners-up in Euro 2012 and a third-place finish in last year's Confederation Cup. Former Everton and Manchester United manager Moyes was recently considered a candidate to take over at the Turk Telekom Arena. A spokesman for Galatasaray told Sportsmail last week that Moyes had met the club president and said: 'They just spoke to each other, exchanging ideas - that it is it. It is true the president talked with David Moyes.' Gone: Galatasaray parted company with Italian manager Roberto Mancini last month .

"By . Oliver Todd . Follow @@oliver_todd . James Collins believes Sam Allardyce is still the right man for the West Ham job, despite criticism from fans last season. Speculation was rife that Allardyce, 59, was on borrowed time with the club's owners after the previous campaign was tinged with periods of disappointment. Having led the Hammers to a top-half finish in 2012/13, Allardyce oversaw a barren run over the turn of the year and reacted angrily when his side were jeered off the pitch following a home win over Hull. Backing: James Collins arrives at training today where he backed his manager to succeed . Ready to go: Allardyce arrived at training too but didn't sport the new West Ham shirt . Championship: 2012/13 . Win percentage: 55.1% . Goals per game scored: 1.80 . Goals per game conceded: 1 . Finish: 3rd - promoted via the playoffs . Premier League: 2012/13, 2013/2014 . Win percentage: 30% . Goals per game scored: 1.12 . Goals per game conceded: 1.37 . Finished: 10th then 13th . Despite those issues, as well as banners being unfurled and opinion polls being held calling for his head, co-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold have stuck by Allardyce, something Collins feels will stand the club in good stead. 'It is great,' the Wales international said. 'As soon as the news came out over the summer the lads were delighted. He has done well for the last two years, we weren't too happy last season but we finished 13th in the end. 'He is so good, he sets out a plan for the whole season and how many points we need to finish as high as we can and improve on last year. 'The first couple of years is always tough - you see teams stay up in the first season and struggle in the second year. Last year we weren't too happy but a lot of teams would have taken that. 'We are looking to kick on this year, the gaffer has already brought in a couple of new signings and I'm sure there will be more. 'Not once has the gaffer ever told us to play direct. It is about winning football matches, before every game he works out the best way to win and that is how we go out and play.' Protests: Many West Ham fans were unhappy with Allardyce's management last season . You what? Allardyce reacts to the boos in West Ham's win over Hull at Upton Park . Collins was speaking on the first day of pre-season training, with new signings Mauro Zarate and Cheikhou Koutate joined at West Ham's Chadwell Heath training base by the likes of Kevin Nolan, Andy Carroll and Ravel Morrison, who is back with the Hammers having spent the back end of last season on-loan at QPR. A left-back is believed to be Allardyce's next target, with Ipswich's Aaron Cresswell rumoured to be on the brink of a move to east London, and Collins wants to keep up the good work from the West Ham defensive unit. 'Defensively we did alright last season,' he added. 'We had 14 clean sheets so like the gaffer has said we need to concentrate on scoring more goals - that is why he has brought in Teddy (Sheringham) to improve us in the attacking half so hopefully we can score more goals and get off to a better start. 'We (the defenders) have all been here a while now and know each other's game very well so whoever is asked to play knows what is expected of them - it is a great group of lads so hopefully we can start off well and kick on from there.'

"By . Mike Dawes . A revamped WGC-Match Play Championship will take a leaf out of the World Cup in Brazil when it is staged for the first time at the TPC Harding Park in San Francisco next year. Organisers hope that a 'World Cup-type format' will breath new life into the first of the season's four elite World Golf Championships (WGC) events where so often in the past the top players have made early exits. Instead of the traditional 'tennis-style' draw where the top seed takes on the 64th seed in the opening round, the 64 players who qualify via the world rankings will be organised into 16 groups of four and guaranteed a minimum of three matches. Move: Tiger Woods hits off the 13th tee at Harding Park, the new home of the WGC-Match Play Championship . Gilded venue: PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem announces that TPC Harding Park will host the U.S. PGA Championship in 2020, the Presidents Cup in 2025 and the WGC-Match Play at City Hall in San Francisco . 'We're going to do it differently next year,' PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem told a news conference on Wednesday after Harding Park had been announced as the venue for the 2015 edition. 'It's going to be a World Cup-type format. 'It's kind of nice that we're able to talk about that in the context of everybody in the United States being riveted to that format over the last month in Brazil where we'll be playing golf in the Olympics for the first time in '16.' Golf will be returning to the Olympics for the first time since 1904 when the Rio de Janeiro Games are held in 2016. 'The 64 players will be broken down into groups of four: 16 groups of four, and then on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, they'll all play each other,' Finchem said of the new Match Play Championship format. 'And then we'll cut to the top 16 players out of that to play to 16, eight, four and two on the weekend.' The playing format has been revised to help address the fickle nature of the championship where there has never been any guarantee that the game's top players will still be in the draw from the quarter-final stage onwards. Final bow: Jason Day of Australia won the last WGC-Match Play to be staged at Dove Mountain in Arizona . Showman: Victor Dubuisson made the final against Day memorable for his outrageous short-game escapes . Former world No 1 Tiger Woods is a three-times winner of the event but he has also suffered early disappointment, losing at the first hurdle in 2002, 2011 and last year and going out in the second round in 2005, 2009 and 2012. This year's edition, held for the final time at Dove Mountain in Arizona suffered with three notable absentees after Woods, second-ranked Australian Adam Scott and five-times major winner Phil Mickelson opted not to play. Finchem outlined three good reasons for the championship's format change. 'It's a lot more golf,' he said. 'There are going to be 96 matches for fans here to go out and watch on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Secondly, over time, the best players rise to the top so we think that'll be positive as it goes into the weekend. 'Third, if you're a Steve Stricker fan or a Bubba Watson fan or a Tiger Woods fan, you're going to be able to follow your favourite player for three days hoping that he makes it into the round of 16. 'It's a new direction for the Match Play for sure but one that's going to create a lot more enthusiasm and excitement.'

"By . Aap . Lance Corporal Todd John Chidgey died in a non-combat incident in Afghanistan . The Australian soldier who died in Afghanistan from a 'non-combat related incident' has been identified as Lance Corporal Todd John Chidgey. Lance Corporal Chidgey was on his sixth tour of Afghanistan when he was found dead in the Australian headquarters at the main coalition base in Kabul earlier this week. The lance corporal was found by colleagues in an administration building at the Kabul base with the gunshot wound about 2pm on Tuesday. Defence has refused to go into the details surrounding the 29-year-old's death while an investigation is pending. He has been described as a 'consummate professional' who earned the respect of his comrades through dedication and hard work. 'Lance Corporal Chidgey's colleagues in the 2nd Commando Regiment have described him as a brilliant bloke to know and work with, who was loyal to the core and would do anything for his mates,' Defence said in a statement. The decorated soldier was born in Gosford, NSW and joined the Australian Defence Force in 2006. He was posted to what is now the 2nd Commando Regiment, serving in Afghanistan on tours ranging from two weeks to six months. At the time of his death, Lance Corporal Chidgey was part of the protective security detachment providing protection for a senior Australian officer. The lance corporal was found by colleagues in an administration building at the Kabul base with the gunshot wound about 2pm on Tuesday (file photo) He is the 41st Australian soldier to die in Afghanistan. Lance Corporal Chidgey's colleagues found him in an administration building with a gunshot wound around 2pm Afghanistan time on Tuesday. He was taken to the nearby medical facility for emergency medical treatment but later died surrounded by his comrades. An investigation is underway into the circumstances surrounding his death. Australia has now ended involvement in combat operations in Afghanistan but about 400 personnel remain in a variety of jobs, including headquarters staff and Afghan National Army mentors. Lance Corporal Chidgey is survived by his mother, father, brothers and partner. Defence Force chief Mark Binskin on Wednesday said after the incident he soldier was taken to a nearby medical facility for emergency treatment. 'Sadly, the soldier's injuries were too severe and he later died surrounded by his mates,' he said. Defence Force chief Mark Binskin would not reveal what happened to the solider but he is Australia's 41st soldier to die in Afghanistan . The base was in lock down last night so evidence could be collected and the Defence Force has since launched an investigation. 'It is critical that we let this investigation take its course, to examine the evidence and establish the facts rather than to speculate about the details or circumstances surrounding the incident,' Air Chief Marshal Binskin said. Defence offered its condolences to the soldier's family and friends. So did Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss who described the incident as tragic considering Australia's engagement in Afghanistan had largely ended. 'We don't know a great deal about the details as yet but I certainly extend sympathy to the family and friends of the soldier whose life has been lost. Our feelings are with the family,' he said.

Australia has now ended involvement in combat operations in Afghanistan but some 400 personnel remain in a variety of jobs, including headquarters staff and Afghan National Army mentors. There's also a significant security presence to guard against both Taliban or insider attacks. The last Australian soldier to die in Afghanistan was another Commando, Corporal Cameron Baird, killed on June 22, 2013 and subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross. When asked about post-traumatic stress disorder in the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Binskin said: 'I am confident in what Defence does in the mental health space'. In 2013, former Middle East commander, retired major General John Cantwell, warned of a looming tsunami of PTSD among those who have served in recent operations.

"By . Louise Cheer . and Aap . Australian kids are consuming more than two serves of fatty food and at least one sugary drink each day, which is directly having an impact on their weight gain. A long-term Deakin University study also found for each unhealthy item consumed by children, their BMI score increased. The new study looked at 4,164 children from ages four to 10, with data collected over four time periods every two years. It classed fatty foods as hamburgers, hot chips, potato chips, doughnuts, cake or chocolate. Sugary drinks included cordial, soft drinks and fruit juice. A Victorian university study has found children are eating more than two serves of fatty foods and consuming at least one sugary drink a day . It found six-years-olds consumed 1.4 serves of sugary drinks a day and 1.9 serves of fatty foods. At 10 years, this increased to 1.5 serves per day for sugary drinks. Deakin University WHO Collaborating Centre for Obesity Prevention's Dr Lynne Millar said many would say 'yes we already know this', but studies to date had been inconclusive. 'Some [found] a connection between sugary drinks and fatty foods and children’s weight and others not,' she said. 'We have conducted a very robust study, and for the first time found that these foods and drinks independently contribute to childhood obesity.' Dr Millar said the study showed that consuming snack foods had become 'normalised' for children and she was shocked by the results. 'I didn't think kids on average would eat that much unhealthy food,' she said. The new study looked at 4,164 children from ages four to 10, with data collected over four time periods every two years . 'I thought they may have days when they'd just have fruit, vegetables and meat and other healthy food, rather than snack food each day.' For each drink or high fat food consumed, the children's BMI-z score - a standardised BMI measure used specifically with children - increased by 0.015 and 0.014 units respectively. 'While the increases may seem low, they are cause for concern,' Dr Millar said. Dr Millar said a normal BMI-z score would be zero, so a score above one was considered overweight and above two was obese. One in four Australian children are overweight or obese and this issue is more than an individual's responsibility, she said.'It's about providing a healthy environment for a child and making it easier for them to eat healthy food and be healthy people,' Dr Millar said.","It is the first time unhealthy eating has been linked directly to weight gain .

"By . Louise Cheer . and Ryan Lipman . Passengers on board a Qantas flight that had to turn back to Los Angeles after a pipe burst have told of the moment water poured down from the ceiling and flooded the floor. Flight QF94, a Melbourne-bound A380 jumbo, was forced back to LAX airport an hour into its flight when the malfunction occurred on the upper deck. It landed shortly after 8pm on Tuesday local time. Those on board have described how people jumped up from their seats in alarm and stood in the aisles to dodge the water. Scroll down for video . A river of water runs down the aisle of business class of the Qantas jet . Ken Price was home to Melbourne after a six-week holiday with his partner. 'We just saw all this water just flowing down from the overhead compartments,' he said. 'We were right at the back of the plane and the stairs to go up were just a raging torrent of water.' Because of the gushing water, Mr Price, a hotel owner, said the aircraft's entertainment systems and ovens were turned off and passengers were given 'survival packs' of food. 'Everyone was just standing in the aisle and wondering what was going to happening. It went on for about 45 minutes I'd say before they decided to turn the plane back,' he said. Unable to get another flight to Melbourne until Wednesday, Mr Price said he and other passengers were getting frustrated as it was 'time to go home'. Fellow flyer Susanna Halliday tweeted pictures of the wet plane, posting photos of the water-soaked seats and isles. In one image, blankets can be seen soaking up the water on the drenched floor, while in a second, Ms Halliday shows an image of her wet seat on the plane. In a later tweet, Ms Halliday said she was not happy with one of the 'worst' hotels that she was staying in after returning to LA. Economy passengers on the A380 watch as water pours from the ceiling of the Qantas airliner . On Wednesday, a Qantas flight bound for Melbourne turned back to Los Angeles after a water pipe burst on board . US actress Yvette Nicole Brown, who is best known for her role as Shirley Bennett on television show Community, was onboard the flight. 'Pipe burst on my #Qantas flight over the Pacific. We were diverted back to LA. River running thru the aisles #ScaryTimes #WillKeepYouPosted,' she tweeted to her 468,000 Twitter followers. The actress later tweeted that she was safe and pleased with how Qantas handled the situation. 'Thanks for the concerned tweets! All is well.  :) @QantasAirways & their flight & gate crews were so awesome to all of us. #SoVeryGrateful,' she posted. Brown was travelling to Melbourne for Oz Comic-Con. A Qantas spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the leak came from a pipe that carried drinking water and water used to wash hands. The decision to turn back to Los Angeles was made as a precaution and there was no major issue in terms of the safety of the plane or passengers. Passengers aboard the flight were provided with accommodation in Los Angeles. The flight has been rescheduled for Thursday, with the spokeswoman saying they would be flying again within 24 hours. The aircraft was examined by engineers in Los Angeles and Qantas was in contact with Airbus to establish the cause of the fault.

Ms Brown said in a Twitter post that she was grateful for Qantas' assistance . 'A flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne has returned to LA about an hour after take off as there was a water leak on board the aircraft,' the spokesman said. The flight left Los Angeles at 4pm on Wednesday. A Qantas statement said: 'Crew on board did everything they could to help customers, including moving them to unaffected areas and providing spare blankets so they could stay dry.' The airline apologised to customers for the inconvenience but stated there were no safety of flight concerns with the water leak. 'Aftermath': Ms Halliday shared an image of blankets being used to soak up the water on the plane's isles . 'My seat on the #Qantas flight 94 cheers': Passenger Susanna Halliday tweeted photos of the soaked plane, including her seat and a wet pillow on it, drenched by the water . But their words didn't placate all the passengers, with some claiming they didn't get enough support or information from airline staff. '#@QantasAirways terrible support from your staff flight. #flood we are in this creepy hotel,' the Twitter post reads and finishes with 'nobody knows anything,' one tweeted. One passenger, who wanted to remain anonymous,  said the water landed on up to 80 economy passengers after flowing down from the back of business class on the plane's upper deck, where the leaked is believed to have started, reported reported Fairfax Media.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Updated: . 08:57 EST, 29 November 2013 . It may sound like something out of science fiction but a Japanese firm plans to cover the moon in a huge swathe of solar panels and use them to power homes here on Earth. Shimizu Corporation's Luna Ring project would stretch almost 6,790 miles around the moon's equator and a field of solar panels would form a belt 250 miles wide. Energy captured by these panels would then be sent to Earth using microwaves and laser lights could be beamed directly to countries where it is needed. Shimizu Corporation plans to install a 250-mile-wide field of solar panels on the moon's equator (concept image pictured). Energy from these panels would be sent to Earth using microwaves and laser lights and the company claims the system would be an 'almost inexhaustible' source of power . According to the plans, the project would produce around 13,000 terawatts of continuous solar energy. The company claims the plans would not only provide an 'almost inexhaustible' energy supply, it would stop the rise of global warming caused by carbon dioxide from current energy sources. The quest for finding alternate sources was hastened in Japan in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear power station crisis in 2011. Up until that point the country relied heavily on nuclear energy and the crisis, sparked by the tsunami in March of that year, highlighted how vulnerable and volatile it is as a source. Shimizu Corporation hasn't yet announced a timeline for the project but it would result in the biggest public infrastructure installation ever constructed. This graphic explains Shimizu Corporation's master plan for its Luna Ring scheme. According to the plans, the project would produce around 13,000 terawatts of continuous solar energy which could be sent directly to countries when needed . However, Shimizu Corporation said on its website: 'A shift from economical use of limited resources to the unlimited use of clean energy is the ultimate dream of all mankind. 'The Luna Ring, our lunar solar power generation concept, . translates this dream into reality through ingenious ideas coupled with . advanced space technologies. 'Virtually inexhaustible, non-polluting solar energy is the . ultimate source of green energy that brings prosperity to nature as well . as our lives. Shimizu plans to cover the equator of the moon in solar panels as part of its Luna Ring project. A field of solar panels would stretch 250 miles wide and almost 6,790 miles around the lunar surface. Energy collected from these panels can only be sent from the near side of the moon, the side that always faces Earth. Cables fitted below these panels would be used to transfer power from the far side. Once collected, this energy would then be transmitted to Earth using microwaves. The 13-mile-diameter microwave antennas would send the power to receiving rectennas on Earth. A guidance beacon would be used to make sure the waves were transmitted to the correct locations. Energy would also be sent using high-energy laser lights direct to receiving facilities. This means the power could be sent to specific countries or precise locations, where needed. Shimizu Corporation believes the system could provide 13,000 terawatts of continuous solar energy. 'Shimizu Corporation proposes the Luna Ring for the infinite coexistence of mankind and the Earth.' The firm claims the project would eliminate inefficiency due to bad weather and fulfill all of the world's energy needs. The plans call for astronauts to return to the moon and begin work with the help of robots that will be required to level the highly cratered surface. It claims the soil on the moon can be used to make water, concrete, oxygen and ceramics necessary for the project. Construction of a railway system to convey materials for maintenance would also be a feature of the project.

"By . Aap . Nick Kyrgios' time may come at Wimbledon but it won't be this year after big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic ended his dream run this morning. The Australian teenager was unable to reproduce the heroics of his sensational upset over world No.1 Rafael Nadal in a 6-7 (7-4) 6-2 6-4 7-6 (7-4) quarter-final loss to eighth seed Raonic. Kyrgios, 19, admitted fatigue played a part but he also got a taste of his own medicine as his 23-year-old opponent turned in a spectacular display of serving. Not happy: Raonic speaks with the umpire while sitting in his chair during the quarter-final match . The 144th-ranked wildcard missed a chance to set up a semi-final against his idol Roger Federer. However he will depart the All England Club with a top 70 ranking and having announced his arrival as arguably the world's most exciting young player. 'It's been the best couple of weeks of my life,' said Kyrgios, the first man to reach the last eight at Wimbledon on debut in a decade. 'Never did I think that I was ever going to make quarter-finals of Wimbledon and beat Nadal on Centre Court. It's all happened pretty fast.' With Kyrgios still adjusting to the rigours of the men's tour, there were doubts as to how he would back up emotionally and physically from Wednesday's staggering four-set upset of Nadal on Centre Court. Soft touch: As well as showing his power, Raonic served and volleyed well . Explosive: Cilic was in supreme serving form on Wednesday evening . Kyrgios said he would depart the tournament proud, confident and having received a priceless lesson in what he needs to do to go even deeper in the future - or one day win it. 'It's been a special week for me but at the same time, it's been so exhausting,' Kyrgios said. 'I've got nothing left to give. That's what grand slams do to you. 'If I was to go further, I'm going to have to get stronger. I'm going to have to get so much better in so many areas.' Raonic, possessing what many consider the world's best serve, belted 39 aces to 15 in a relentless display that had Kyrgios shaking his in disbelief at times. Power: The Australian teenager unleashes a forehand during an impressive first set . Salute: Kyrgios looked to be on top early on, building on the form he showed against Rafael Nadal . At one stage, Raonic did not drop a point for nine straight service games. 'He served unbelievably,' said Kyrgios, who was similarly-impressive on serve against Nadal. 'He was in such a rhythm that I just couldn't do anything out there.' While Kyrgios couldn't find the level he produced against Nadal, his serve dug him out of some tricky spots in the first set before he edged a tense tiebreak to take a significant step towards the semi-finals. He was at his flamboyant best early in the second set, producing one staggering cross-court winner at full stretch. But he went alarmingly off the boil, dropping serve twice as Raonic raced through the second set. Kyrgios responded, breaking Raonic early in the third set but it proved a false dawn for the Australian. The Canadian broke twice to regain the ascendancy and closed to within a set of victory. It looked like Raonic would run away with it but, as he has all tournament, Kyrgios fought gamely. He forced a tiebreak and saved three match points before Raonic finally put an end to an unforgettable match - and Australian involvement in the singles draw. Ranked outside the top 800 at the start of last year, former top-ranked junior Kyrgios' ranking will shoot up to around world No.65 on the back of a run that also featured a second-round upset of French 13th seed Richard Gasquet, in which he saved nine match points.","The Australian was unable to repeat the heroics of the previous day, losing to Canada's Milos Raonic 6-7 (7-4), 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4)

"By . Mark Prigg . A Brooklyn firm backed by PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel and Asia's richest man Mr. Li Ka-shing, has revealed plans to grow leather in the lab. Modern Meadow, which today announced $10m in funding, hopes to 'reducing the global impact of livestock production'. It has already shown off leather grown using its technique, and says it will also be able to eventually grow meat using the same system. Modern Meadow has also lready shown off leather grown using its secret 3D printing technique, and says it will also be able to eventually grow meat using the same system. Modern Meadow has remained incredibly secretive abut its process. The firm has 'invented a tissue engineering technique based on bioprinting, the 3D assembly of tissues driven by computer controlled processes,' according to its web site. At the SXSW festival earlier this year it gave out samples of meat grown using the technique. The firm has remained secretive about its methods, simply saying it develops cultured leather and meat products that require no animal slaughter and much lower inputs of land, water, energy and chemicals. The firm has 'invented a tissue engineering technique based on bioprinting, the 3D assembly of tissues driven by computer controlled processes,' according to its web site. 'With the livestock industry being the largest user of land and water and the leading driver of climate change, now is the time to pursue better alternatives,' said CEO and founder Andras Forgacs. 'Our goal is to develop new cultured leather materials with advantages in design, performance, sustainability and animal welfare. 'In the longer term, we are also developing meat products that are healthier, safer and don’t require harming animals or the environment. 'We are thrilled to have the support of such visionary and engaged investors.' The firm's latest funding round was led by Horizons Ventures, the venture fund of Mr. Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest man. The firm says it can replace both leather and beef with a bioengineered material 3D printed in the lab. Based in Hong Kong, Horizons Ventures is a leading investor in some of the world’s most innovative companies and disruptive technologies including Facebook, Waze, Skype, Spotify, Siri and Hampton Creek, which produces eggless mayonnaise. The company will use the new investment to accelerate R&D and product development as well as to open an expanded research headquarters at the Brooklyn Army Terminal in New York City. According to Bart Swanson of Horizons Ventures, 'We are delighted to partner with Modern Meadow whose truly innovative and disruptive solutions together with its increasing cost effectiveness can help address global resources challenges.'","Firm hopes to work with designers to develop animal-free leather .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Here's a tip for tipping at a Waffle House restaurant: Use cash. A waitress working the graveyard shift at a North Carolina Waffle House was told by her manager that because of a restaurant policy regarding tipping she would not be allowed to collect on a $1,000 tip one of her customers left for her last month. Shaina Brown, 26, is a single mother of three who works two part-time jobs. She also takes classes during the day so she can someday become an English teacher. Shafted: Shaina Brown was denied a $1,000 tip because the customer who left it used a credit card . On Mother's Day, Brown was working the graveyard shift at a Waffle House in Raleigh when a customer left her with a shocking surprise. 'He said, ""I’m going to bless you today,'"" Brown told FoxNews.com . on Tuesday. 'He was just trying to show that there are still good people . out there.' It was about 3:30 a.m. when the man - who has chosen to not identify himself - left Brown a $1,500 tip on his credit card, with $1,000 of it to go to Brown and the other $500 to go to a 'haggard-looking woman' at a nearby table, according to the Raleigh News and Observer. However, the Waffle House manager refused to give Brown the cash, citing a restaurant policy against servers receiving large tips made on a credit card - according to the restaurant, the rule is in place in case a customer later disputes the charge. Policy: The manger at the Waffle House where Brown works (pictured) told her he couldn't give her the money because of a restaurant policy about tipping with credit cards . 'When a guest makes a tip of this size, it is our procedure to refund . the tip amount and ask the guest to make the tip in either cash or a . check,' the chain said in a statement to Fox News. Brown, however, had no way of getting touch with the customer to ask if he would cut her a check - so the unidentified man's generous tip would go unclaimed. 'A lot of servers wait for that day when you get a tip like that, and . when I didn’t get it, it was very humiliating and heartbreaking,' she . said. Brown began calling local media outlets to tell them about the tip she lost, and NewsObserver.com columnist Josh Shaffer tracked him down. The unidentified man who left Brown the tip was tracked down several weeks later and wrote her a personal check to make up for the money she was denied by her employer . Brown's benefactor, a local businessman who owns several restaurants in the area, was told how she never received the money he had intended on giving her and wrote her a personal check. Brown says she thinks the man left her such a large tip because he's in the restaurant industry and understands how hard she works - and how well she treats her customers. 'I try to make them feel as comfortable as possible,' Brown said. 'He knows good service when he sees it.'","Shaina Brown was given a $1,000 tip while working the graveyard shift at a North Carolina Waffle House .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Until 10 years ago our knowledge of the Saturnian system was limited to three brief flybys by three Nasa spacecraft: Pioneer 11 in 1979, Voyager 1 in 1980 and Voyage in 1981. But that all changed when Cassini-Huygens arrived on 30 June 2004 and entered orbit around Saturn, the first manmade spacecraft ever to do so. Since then it has made numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including lakes on the moon Titan and giant storms on Saturn, and today it celebrates a decade orbiting the planet. Today the Cassini spacecraft, artist's illustration shown, celebrates 10 hugely successful years in orbit around Saturn. During this time it has dramatically increased our knowledge of this fascinating planetary system, revealing vast bodies of liquid on the surface of Titan, giant storms on Saturn and much more . When Cassini arrived in 2004 its primary mission was only scheduled to last four years. Launch: 15 October 1997 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida . Dimensions: 22 feet (6.7 metres) high; 13.1 feet (4 meters) wide . Total weight: 5,712 kilograms (12,593 pounds) with fuel, Huygens probe, adapter, etc . Orbiter weight (unfueled): 2,125 kilograms (4,685 pounds) Power: 885 watts (633 watts at end of mission) from radioisotope thermoelectric generators . Distance traveled to reach Saturn: 2.2 billion miles (3.5 billion kilometres) Key instruments: Imaging radar, cosmic dust analyser, infrared mapping spectrometer . Since then, having survived the extreme environment it inhabits, it has been granted three mission extensions that have seen it perform unprecedented science. It has remained in orbit around Saturn for one third of the planet’s 30-year trek around the sun, observing its seasonal changes in the process. The mission is jointly run by Nasa, Esa and the Italian Space Agency (ASI). Its total cost is about £1.9 billion ($3.26 billion), of which the U.S. supplied 80 per cent, Europe 15 per cent and Italy 5 per cent. It was launched on 18 October 1997 and, during its seven-year trip to Saturn, it flew by Venus, the Moon and Jupiter. The highlight of its initial year at Saturn was arguably the release of the Huygens probe onto the surface of Titan. On Christmas day 2004 this probe, 4.3 ft (1.3 metres) across, was released and, on 14 January 2005, it entered the atmosphere of Saturn’s largest moon Titan. That same day it became the first spacecraft ever to touch down on a body in the outer solar system and, in the process, spotted surface features that indicated the presence of liquids. Since then Titan has been studied in depth by Cassini, and in so doing it has revealed lakes and seas on its surface, in addition to its thick atmosphere. This has led some to dub it the most Earth-like place in the solar system, aside from our own planet of course. But that is just scratching the surface of Cassini’s many accomplishments. Titan . is Saturn's largest moon - with a radius of appropriately 1,600 miles (2,574 . kilometers). It's bigger than planet Mercury and is the second-largest . moon in the solar system. In January 2004 the Huygens probe landed on its surface and sent back images (right). The . atmosphere of Titan is largely composed of nitrogen; minor components . lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and nitrogen-rich . organic smog. The climate - . including wind and rain - creates surface features similar to those on . Earth, including dunes, rivers, lakes and seas (probably of liquid . methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather . patterns as on Earth. Launched in 1997, Cassini has been . exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004. On Saturn, a full year is the . equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning Cassini has only been able to . observe a third of a Saturn year. Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from . northern winter to northern summer. Cassini revealed that Titan's . surface is shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane (the . main component of natural gas), during its initial flybys. Scientists are interested in Titan because its atmosphere is most like that on Earth. Titan is said to resemble a . frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before oxygen entered the atmosphere. This false-color mosaic, made from infrared data collected by the Cassini spacecraft, reveals hydrocarbon lakes at Titan, the only other place in the solar system that is known to have stable liquid on its surface, though its lakes are made of liquid ethane and methane rather than liquid water . After 10 years at Saturn, the spacecraft has beamed back to Earth hundreds of gigabytes of scientific data, enabling the publication of more than 3,000 scientific reports. ‘Having a healthy, long-lived spacecraft at Saturn has afforded us a precious opportunity,’ said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ‘By having a decade there with Cassini, we have been privileged to witness never-before-seen events that are changing our understanding of how planetary systems form and what conditions might lead to habitats for life.’ Among its discoveries Cassini helped to increase our understanding of how water can form on other celestial bodies. This was most notable from the discovery of icy crovolcanoes erupting on the moon Enceladus. Once about every 15 years, the sun shines on the edge of the ring plane and the northern and southern sides of the rings receive little sunlight. Cassini measured the thick, long shadows from this rare event to determine the heights of structures within the rings, as shown in this picture of Saturn's 'B ring' This incredible image of Saturn, called 'The Day the Earth smiled', was taken by Cassini on 19 July 2013. In it Saturn is lit up by the sun behind it, revealing glorious detail in the planet and its rings. At about the 4 o'clock position, just below the rings, is a faint dot that is Earth as seen 898 million miles (1.44 billion kilometers) away . While Cassini was originally approved for a four-year study of the Saturn system, the project's engineers and scientists had high hopes that the mission might carry on longer, and designed the system for endurance. The spacecraft has been remarkably trouble-free, and from an engineering standpoint, the main limiting factor for Cassini's lifetime now is how much propellant is left in its tanks. The mission owes a great deal of its longevity to skillful and efficient piloting by the mission's navigation and operations teams. ‘Our team has done a fantastic job optimizing trajectories to save propellant, and we've learned to operate the spacecraft to get the most out of it that we possibly can,’ said Earl Maize, Cassini project manager at JPL. ‘We're proud to celebrate a decade of exploring Saturn, and we look forward to many discoveries still to come.’ It has been a decade since Cassini first soared over rings of ice and fired its engine to fall forever into the embrace of Saturn. Today the Cassini mission celebrates 10 years of exploring the planet, its rings and moons. It arrived for a four-year mission but has since been continuously extended, although it will end in 2017 . Saturn's polar regions have surprised scientists with a the presence of a long-lived hexagonal-shaped jet stream in the north (pictured) and two hurricane-like storms at both poles. The driving forces of each remain a mystery. In the remaining three years of Cassini's mission, scientists hope to learn more of their properties . Enceladus's massive plume (pictured) was such a surprise that mission designers completely reshaped the mission to get a better look. It became even more important when Cassini found evidence of water-based ice in the plume, making Enceladus one of the most exciting science destinations in the solar system . The mission, however, will come to a conclusion in 2017. By this year Cassini will no longer have enough fuel to maintain its orbit around Saturn. So, to prevent it accidentally crashing on and contaminating one of the moons, Nasa will send the spacecraft diving into the atmosphere of Saturn. In the process the spacecraft will be crushed and destroyed, but not before it returns fascinating information about the gas giant’s cloud tops. And this last hurrah will mark the end of an era; currently there is no future spacecraft planned to visit Saturn. With interest instead focusing on Mars, Jupiter and other moons like Europa, it may be some time before Saturn gets another mission of its own. Some areas of the scientific community, though, are hoping form a mission to Titan. And they may just get their wish if, before its plunge into Saturn’s atmosphere, Cassini spots something on the surface that piques the interest of the whole world. - The Huygens probe makes first landing on a moon in the outer solar system (Titan) - Discovery of active, icy plumes on the Saturnian moon Enceladus . - Saturn's rings revealed as active and dynamic -- a laboratory for how planets form . - Titan revealed as an Earth-like world with rain, rivers, lakes and seas . - Studies of Saturn's great northern storm of 2010-2011 . - Studies reveal radio-wave patterns are not tied to Saturn's interior rotation, as previously thought . - Vertical structures in the rings imaged for the first time . - Study of prebiotic chemistry on Titan . - Mystery of the dual, bright-dark surface of the moon Iapetus solved . - First complete view of the north polar hexagon and discovery of giant hurricanes at both of Saturn's poles .","Today marks the 10th anniversary of the Cassini probe arriving at Saturn .

"By . Sophie Borland . Under pressure: The Royal College of Midwives have compared maternity wards to 'pressure cookers' which can't cope with demand . Half of maternity wards are having to turn away women in labour because they are so busy, a report warns. It says the lives of mothers-to-be and their babies are being put at risk because they are forced to travel miles to alternative hospitals. The report by the Royal College of Midwives states that many units are ‘bursting at the seams’ and like ‘pressure cookers’ unable to cope with the soaring demand. Britain’s birth rate is at an all-time high, partly driven by the influx of migrants, many of whom are relatively young and ready to start families. In addition, there has been a surge in the numbers of women in their 40s giving birth after having delayed motherhood to pursue their careers. The report found more than a quarter of maternity units have had to restrict their home-birthing services during the past 12 months to free staff to work on the labour wards. Midwives also say there has been an increase in complicated births, often because mothers are older or more obese. All this has left maternity units struggling to cope – despite an extra 1,000 midwives being employed by the NHS in the past couple of years. The Royal College of Midwives has calculated another 5,000 are needed to ensure mothers and babies are cared for properly. The RCM’s survey of 91 senior  midwives found that 46 per cent had been forced to close their unit to women in labour at least once in the past 12 months. A fifth said their budget had been slashed in the past year and a third said they did not have enough money for necessary numbers of staff. Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the RCM, said: ‘Despite welcome increases in midwife numbers, this survey describes a worrying picture of our maternity services, and one that shows it is not improving. ‘The midwifery shortages and cuts to services it describes will have a detrimental impact on the care women, babies and their families receive. ‘This shows a service that sometimes severely restricts the choices available to women, is struggling to provide continuity of care and is bursting at the seams in its ability to cope. ‘The temporary closures it highlights are just the tip of the iceberg. ‘Before closures happen, services . have already been stretched to their limit, and closing is the point at . which safety could be compromised if that does not happen. ‘I . have deep misgivings about the quality of the service midwives and . maternity support workers are able to provide, working in such an . unstable, pressure-cooker atmosphere.’ Care and attention: According to the RCM, pregnant women are being put at risk when they are forced to travel longer distances to be seen by a midwife . The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that 813,200 babies were born in 2012, the highest number for any year since 1972. One experienced senior midwife, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ‘All the fat is off the bone – we cannot strip any more off. ‘Having worked in the NHS for more than 30 years I have never known it  to be so bad, and I fear for mothers and babies and midwives who are working tirelessly. ‘It is most difficult now we are trying to provide more for less with an increasing birth rate, but as far as trust boards are concerned this is not enough. : The idealisms from the Department of Health and House of Commons are just not matching up with the requirements to provide this. ‘Poor performance, without adequate support, is increasing. I know they are being pressed from on high, but the elastic will break.’","Mothers-to-be are at risk because they have to travel miles to other wards .

"By . Barbara Jones . IN BAGHDAD . I watched yesterday as convoys of exhausted Iraqi soldiers returned from the battle to save Baghdad from a ruthless onslaught by fanatical jihadist fighters. The weary men told shocking stories of vicious, hand-to-hand fighting with ISIS Muslim militia – and of innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. ISIS - the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria - have swept mercilessly through Iraq and now have the  capital in the grip of a vicious pincer movement. Scroll down for video . Battle weary: Convoys of exhausted soldiers were last night returning from a a 12-hour fight in Balad . By last night, they had reached the town of Balad, just 55 miles north of Baghdad, and the battle rages there, as Iraq’s leaders bid to save the capital from being overrun, as many other Iraqi cities already have. As the battle for Baghdad loomed, the U.S. yesterday ordered aircraft carrier George H W Bush to move to the Persian Gulf for possible air strikes against the militants, while Iranian president Hassan Rouhani suggested the two traditional enemies may work together to defend Iraq, saying: ‘When the U.S. takes action against [the militants], then one can think about cooperation.’ At a checkpoint near his base at Camp Taji on the Baghdad-Samarra Highway, Lt Omar al-Saadi shouted down to me yesterday. ‘Things are very bad up there but we are ready for it. This is our country and our people. We can defeat the terrorists,’ he said. Several armoured Jeeps and Hummers donated by the American military were being towed, disabled in fire-fights with jihadists who have seized tanks, weapons and even Hummers as their spoils of war in Mosul and Tikrit. Motorists hooted their horns and waved in support at the young soldiers returning to the 9th Armoured Division’s base at Taji. Shocking: The Iraqi forces told how 'crazy' Jihadists would stop at nothing to hold on to their recent gains . Volunteers: Thousands of Iraqi men in Baghdad queued for hours to sign up to fight the ISIS militants . ‘We have better equipment and training than the jihadists but they are crazy and ruthless’, said soldier Khalid Byati. ‘They don’t care about dying so they have no rules, they don’t just want to take the town, they want to destroy us and all the civilians. These men have no mercy.’ The regular army, shamed by recent reports of hundreds of troops in Mosul city abandoning their posts, is putting on a convincing show of patriotism and professionalism in an all-out bid to save Baghdad. Here in the city its five million war-battered residents, all but engulfed by the aftershock of seeing major cities fall into ISIS hands last week, are finally showing signs of an organised fightback, though many international analysts believe it may be too late. Tens of thousands of volunteers, many of them veterans of Iraq’s numerous wars, are flooding into the national army’s recruiting centre and signing up for an intensive two weeks in training camp before heading into conflict with the militants. Takeover: ISIS militants have set up their black flag above towns and cities across the north and west of Iraq . Elderly Abdul Naby, a construction worker dressed in traditional dish-dash, waited in line at the al-Muthanna Camp in Mansur suburb. Like many others, he was giving up his Saturday to stand in the heat and dust of the old airport to file his details in a disused prefab office hastily set up to register the recruits. Mr Naby stated that he was answering a call to fight to the death. ‘Our religious leader Ali al-Sistani has called on all of us to protect Baghdad,’ he said. ‘I am strong and fit and proud to answer the call along with so many of my fellow countrymen. Terrorists will never rule our land.’As he . spoke, more men young and old were dropped off by cars and taxis at the . busy road junction where they introduced themselves to soldiers on duty . and then took the steep road down from the highway to report for . service. The eldest daughter of fallen . dictator Saddam Hussein has praised ISIS’s bloody attacks in Iraq, . saying she is happy to see their ‘victories’. Raghad . Hussein, 47, (below) who lives in luxurious exile in Jordan’s capital . Amman, has said the fighters are aided by former military chiefs and . soldiers who supported the Ba’ath party that lay behind her father’s . regime. In posts in . Arabic on her Facebook page, Miss Hussein appears to address her father, . saying: ‘Your men and women have answered the country’s call, and they . are coming to Baghdad.’ In a post yesterday, she said: ‘O . Baghdad, we are returning with God’s help.’ Her comments come as ISIS . overran villages in the province of Diyala, 50 miles north-west of . Baghdad. She also spoke . to the Arabic Al-Quds newspaper, saying: ‘I am happy to see all these . victories... Some day I will come back to the rebel cities and read . Al-Fatiha [a Koran chapter] over my father’s soul.’ The . current Iraqi government has charged Miss Hussein with offences . including the financing of terrorist groups – crimes that could lead to . the death penalty. The . army’s mission: To prevent the total collapse of an Iraq still . tottering from the American-British invasion which removed their . despised dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003 but which also dismantled its . proud military, disenfranchised its Sunni Muslim minority, and fomented . deep sectarian rifts. The vacuum created by America’s military departure in 2011 has been filled by a jihadist movement more deadly than Al Qaeda itself. ISIS leader Abu Mohammed al-Adnani has declared he wants to convert Iraq and neighbouring Syria to Muslim states under Sharia law. He told his followers in a video last week: ‘Continue your march as the battle is not yet raging in Baghdad. We have a score to settle there.’ As the estimated 7,000 jihadists carry out a ruthless killing spree with horrific reports of beheadings, summary executions and even crucifixions in the towns they have overthrown, they have been joined enthusiastically by Sunni Muslims. Iraq government forces have in the meantime been joined by rogue militias such as the Mahdi Army, led by Sheikh Moqtada al-Sadr, and its affiliated group of murderous thugs, the Asaeab Ahl al-Haq, which means League of the Righteousness. And there were reports last night that some British Shia Muslims are heading to Iraq to fight against ISIS. Political analysts predict that this factionalism spells the end of Iraq as a cohesive country, and that if Baghdad falls the subsequent division of Iraq will be even more tragic than the West’s invasion. But that might be to underestimate the tenacity of the people of Baghdad. They found a way to accommodate Saddam Hussein’s repressive regime, building decent lives and businesses around it. They withstood an unwarranted invasion which saw definitive insults inflicted on them. At the heavily-armed chicane leading into the fortified Green Zone created for America’s safety and comfort in the centre of their city, they tolerated a sign stating: ‘If You Enter Here You Will Be Shot.’ Yesterday, while a newly-imposed 10pm to 6am curfew outlasted dawn over the city of minarets, there was an obvious increase in military checkpoints but otherwise it was business as usual. I sensed that, with its cruel history, Baghdad had seen too much to be able to respond in any other way. Hapless President Nouri al-Maliki, roundly blamed for his government’s lack of direction and inability to pinpoint areas of potential trouble, has failed to bring home a vote to declare a state of emergency. Insurgency regularly results in explosions in some troubled suburbs where Sunni and Shia still clash. There were two such explosions last week. But the good people of Baghdad are not gearing up to leave. At our hotel, the manager was bemused at the idea of an exit plan. ‘This is a safe place,’ he said. ‘The Pakistani and Afghan embassies are both based in this building. No one is worried. We want you to stay and enjoy this lovely city.","Weary Iraqi soldiers were yesterday returning from gruelling 12-hour battle in Balad against militant fighters .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Finding extraterrestrial signals has been dreamed about for decades. But a researcher from the University of Cádiz in Spain says we shouldn’t be looking - because we’re not ready to meet aliens. Gabriel De la Torre revealed to MailOnline how his survey of students showed the general level of ignorance and influence of religion would leave us shocked if we made first contact. A study by Professor Gabriel De la Torre from the University of Cádiz in Spain claims that we're not ready to make first contact. He claims we're not prepared mentally or ethically to meet beings unlike ourselves and we should try to improve our 'global consciousness' Since 1984 the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Seti) Institute has been looking for signs of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. Of the 116 students... 72.8% believe that demons and angels exist. 33.7% don't think humans are the origin of global warming. 82.1% think it is important to have a space agency. 71.4% think the military should have the main role in the event of contact with an alien civilisation. 80% believe if we find aliens more advanced than us they will try to conquer us. 78% believe there is a chance we've been visited by aliens in the past. To date nothing has been found, although the search continues unabated. Members of the project are now going further by sending out messages from Earth (Active Seti) to try and contact other lifeforms. But De la Torre, a professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Cádiz and participant in previous projects such as Esa’s Mars 500 (a simulated mission to Mars on Earth), has carried out a study that he claims indicates we are not ready to make contact. In the study he sent a questionnaire to 116 students in Spain, the US and Italy. De la Torre tells MailOnline he used students because they ‘will be the future politicians, scientists, the people in charge, so I wanted to know what their knowledge was.’ The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Seti) Institute was established in 1984. Since then it has used a number of observatories around the world, like the Allen Telescope Array (pictured), to try and find alien signals from another world, but so far nothing has been found . The questions were split into five sections: religious beliefs, the environment, space-related knowledge, their daily activities and their opinions on life issues. ‘In all those areas I defined a different type of question based on other studies that I think related to Seti research,’ De la Torre says. These included questions such as how likely they thought life was to exist on other planets, what year man first walked on the moon and what the largest planet in the solar system is. The results were somewhat disconcerting for De la Torre. For example only 82 per cent of the students knew the first moon landing was in 1969. ‘The conclusions were that scientific knowledge, especially the knowledge related to space among college students, is not good,’ he continues. ‘So I think space agencies should increase education efforts.' Another conclusion by De la Torre was that religious beliefs seem to be very strong in general. While . not necessarily a problem, he says this may influence the opinions of . people facing major events in future such as making first contact. On 16 November 1974 the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico (pictured) was used to send out a signal called the Arecibo message, a 'calling card' from Earth to potential alien races. However De la Torre says we shouldn't perform 'Active Seti' like this as we aren't ready to make contact . But ultimately it is our lack of appreciation for our own planet and our place in the universe that would be our downfall, he says. ‘We’re not ready to talk to extraterrestrials because global consciousness is not developed enough in the population,' he concludes. ‘People have daily life problems and the government doesn’t pay attention to global issues like the planet and the environment. ‘That makes us a species too focused on daily life problems, we don’t have an awareness of our surroundings. ‘It’s like when a meteor falls in some place on the planet, it’s big news. But that’s a regular real possibility. ‘If we have a more global consciousness about our situation on the planet, how fragile the planet is, maybe that’s a step in the evolution of our consciousness as a species. ‘There could be other intelligent life out there and it could be really different from us physically, mentally, socially and even morally. ‘They could maybe not even be biological, they could be robots. ‘Right now I don’t think as a species we are ready. ‘Of course some people are ready, but as a species I think it would be a big shock.’","A professor from Spain says we're not ready to meet extraterrestrial life .

"By . Steph Cockroft . It might not be quite as well-known as its famous namesake in Surrey - but this Hampton Court is certainly no less impressive. The stunning 26-bedroom manor house in Hope under Dinmore, Herefordshire, is not only set across 935 acres of land, but also has a fascinating history dating back to the 15th Century. And now anyone who fancies saying they live in Hampton Court is in with a chance - as long as they have £12million to hand over. Not that one! Hampton Court, in Hope under Dinmore, Herefordshire, which shares a name with the royal palace in Surrey, has been put on the market for £12million . The stunning 15th Century Medieval Castle is set on sprawling estate which covers . 935 acres of land, including farms, cottages, an orangery and landscaped gardens . The Grade I listed manor house was built after being ordered . by Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Hereford, who was crowned Henry IV in 1399 - not the same King Henry which built Hampton Court Palace . The whole estate is split into five lots, meaning the house could be . bought along with a smaller portion of land - 74 acres - for a slightly more modest £4.5million . Unlike Hampton Court Palace in Surrey, the Grade I listed manor house and its sprawling estate of farms, cottages and woodland is up for grabs and could soon be lived in - albeit by a rather large family. And those with a more modest budget could still buy the castle - complete with a comparatively smaller 74-acre portion of land - for about £4.5million. But, just like Hampton Court Palace, whoever it is that buys the property will be following a long line of historic owners. The property was ordered to be built as a house by Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Hereford, who was crowned Henry IV in 1399. It was . then granted by Henry IV to Sir Rowland Lenthall when he married Margaret Fitzalan, daughter of the Earl of Arundel and a cousin of . the king. Lenthall, who . built the original quadrangular manor house in 1427, was then granted a . licence to crenellate the property - which means he was allowed to fortify the house  - by Henry VI. The house became a castle in 1434 and the interior has been revamped and redesigned by its different owners. It now has a heraldic theme throughout the property . When the castle was renovated by former owner Robert Van Kampen in the 1990s, the rooms were filled with an abundance of armoury, including a chandelier set with stag heads . The plush dining room boats a stunning chandelier, ornate curtains and . thick wood-panelled walls which are in touch with the property's . historic roots . Sir . Rowland was succeeded by his daughter, who married the Baron of Burford. Their grandson then sold Hampton Court to Sir Humphrey . Coningsby in 1510. After that, Hampton . Court remained in the Coningsby family, a prominent noble Herefordshire . family, until the early 19th Century when the estate was purchased by . Richard Arkwright. He was the son of the famous inventor Sir Richard . Arkwright, who rose from poverty to invent the spinning frame, which came to the fore during the Industrial Revolution. Richard's son John then comissioned the remodelling . of the house in the 1830s and 40s. The Arkwrights lived . at Hampton Court until 1912. The castle, which includes its own quaint chapel, pictured, was looked . after by a line of aristocrats before remaining in the Coningsby family - . a prominent noble Herefordshire family - until the 19th Century . It was then taken over by the son of the famous inventor Sir Richard . Arkwright, who invented the spinning frame, which was used in the Industrial Revolution . In . the 1990s, the house was revamped again by American owner Robert Van Kampen. He spent millions restoring the crumbling building and introducing a heraldic theme - including a chandelier set with stag heads - to the castle. Now the castle also boasts an ambitious garden, which is encased by Victorian walls. The gardens include stunning . flower displays divided by canals, island pavilions and . pleached avenues. The grounds include a waterfall in a sunken garden, pictured left, among the vast lawns and beautiful trees, which look out over woodland and fields . The landscaped gardens include a maze, a flower garden divided by canals . and an ornamental kitchen garden of fruit and vegetables, used to supply . produce to the orangery, which is housed in the conservatory built in 1836 . The sunken garden, left, is accessed through a 150-year-old wisteria tunnel, which is covered with draping trees and leads to the castle's stunning gardens . Today, the . kitchen garden is full of organic fruit and vegetables used by the orangery restaurant, which is housed in a conservatory attached to the property in 1836. Just like Hampton Court Palace, there is also a maze with a gothic tower at its centre, from where there is a panoramic view over the estate. There . is also a 150-year-old wisteria tunnel that leads to a waterfall in the . sunken garden, as well as vast lawns and ancient trees. The house also featured in the BBC TV Series Survivors, a post-apocalyptic series about people who had survived a plague, which aired in the 1970s. Many parts of the first series were filmed in and around the house, which was empty at the time. Arguably the country's most famous Hampton Court is the royal palace based in East Molesey, Surrey. Hampton Court Palace has not been lived in by the British Royal Family since the 18th Century but, along with St. James's Palace, it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many owned by King Henry VIII. It was originally built for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, a favourite of King Henry VIII, in 1514. But fifteen years later, when Wolsey fell from favour, the palace was passed to the king, who enlarged it. The next century, King William III's rebuilt and expanded the castle, in an attempt to rival the revered Palace de Versailles. But work was stopped in 1694, before the project was completed. It left the palace with two distinct styles - Tudor and Baroque - which still remains to this day. Today, the palace is open to the public and is a major tourist attraction. The palace is cared for by an independent charity, Historic Royal Palaces. The palace's Home Park is the site of the annual Hampton Court Palace Festival and Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, which is renowned around the world.","Hampton Court in Herefordshire was built in the 15th Century after being order by Henry Bolingbroke .

"By . John Greechan . Glasgow 2014 has been dealt a serious blow after Jamaican sprint star Yohan Blake declared himself unavailable for next month’s Commonwealth Games – even though he’ll be competing in a Diamond League event at Hampden just days before the ‘main event’. With the chances of Usain Bolt making a rapid recovery in time to compete in the Games also look increasingly slim, according to reports in the Caribbean, the anticipated presence of Blake was viewed as a real consolation to sprint fans. But the former world champion’s manager confirmed yesterday that Blake, who suffered a series of injuries last season, was going to pick and choose his races this year. Which means focusing on the big money of the Diamond League. Unavailable: Blake won't compete in the Commonwealth Games for Jamaica . Fit: Blake competing recently in the 100m at the Adidas Grand Prix in New York . VIDEO Blake suffers shock loss in New York . Cubie Seegobin, explaining why the 24-year-old had also missed the Jamaican trials, told local media: ‘His entire team seriously considered him competing at the trials and Commonwealth Games, it was something that we were looking at for a long time. ‘But, in the end, the team decided that they would do what’s in the best interest of the athlete. 'He’s healthy, you saw how he has looked since coming back, but he is looking forward to the next three years, so this year is about getting him back in the saddle and getting him back to running really fast again. ‘We only have about seven to eight races scheduled for him this year, although he is ready and able to run very fast like he did in Nassau at the World Relays.’ The nature of Blake’s withdrawal is likely to infuriate Glasgow 2014 officials and fans who bought tickets expecting to see the Commonwealth’s best compete for gold because he remains committed the lucrative Diamond League circuit. As well as running in the Glasgow Grand Prix at the Games venue of Hampden on July 11-12, Blake is also pledged to compete at the London Anniversary Games on July 20, three days before the opening ceremony in Glasgow. Cohorts: Bolt celebrates with team-mate Yohan Blake following the 200-metre final during London 2012 . Fast men: The two pose on the track after their relay victory at the same event . The news of Blake’s decision will come as a major hammer blow to the credibility of the Games, despite the guaranteed presence of world and Olympic champions across a range of track and field events – most notably middle distance legend David Rudisha, world record holder over 800 metres. Equally worrying for Glasgow 2014 will be the fact that Blake’s decision came after discussions with Glen Mills, the coach he shares with Bolt; the fastest man on earth also misses the Jamaican trials and reports in the Caribbean suggest he remains a long shot – at best – to compete in the Games. Both sprinters missed last Friday’s registration deadline but organisers hoped Bolt would claim a medical exemption, allowing him to skip the trials but still compete. Sources close to the Bolt camp, though, suggest that he is extremely unlikely to line up in Glasgow.","Yohan Blake has declared himself unavailable for Commonwealth Games .

"By . Andy Dolan . A vet who was trampled by a cow was left seriously ill after doctors missed her injuries and sent her home from hospital with nothing but painkillers. Amy Jennings, 23, suffered broken ribs and a collapsed lung when she was crushed by the half-ton animal as she examined cattle at a farm. But hospital doctors failed to order X-rays which would have highlighted the damage and instead said she had merely suffered painful bruising to her ribs. Accident: Amy Jennings had been called to a farm in Halam, Nottinghamshire to treat a cow with breathing difficulties when a second animal knocked her off her feet and trampled on the left side of her chest . Error: Staff at Kings Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire failed to take X-rays that would have revealed Miss Jennings was suffering from 'massive' internal bleeding caused by three broken ribs and a collapsed lung . The newly qualified vet was discharged from King’s Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, with paracetamol. Two days later she collapsed at home and was taken to the major trauma unit at the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham with ‘massive’ internal bleeding. Doctors were stunned to discover she had three broken ribs and a collapsed lung. Miss Jennings had an emergency procedure to drain three pints of blood from her chest. Medics described her condition as serious. She was sent home after six days but had to return on Friday for a second chest drain. Yesterday the graduate, from Bingham, Nottinghamshire, criticised the care she received at the £320million King’s Mill Hospital. She said a CT scan, which uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body, had not only revealed the broken ribs but also a ‘massive’ accumulation of air and blood in the lung. Emergency: When she collapsed two days after being trampled, Miss Jennings was rushed to the major trauma centre at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham to have three pints of blood drained from her chest . Poor treatment: Instead of having X-rays taken, Miss Jennings was moved to the side of the A&E department at Kings Mill Hospital where a nurse deemed her condition not serious enough for a bay on a ward . Miss Jennings added: ‘I had an emergency chest drain fitted, which immediately drained 1.8 litres of blood from my chest, had two units of blood transfused and was in a serious condition. Doctors at the QMC could not believe that King’s Mill had failed to X-ray me, given the nature of my injury, as this would have shown the fractured ribs and possibly some fluid or air in my chest.’ Miss Jennings, who qualified as a vet in July at the Royal Veterinary College, was injured three weeks ago after being called out to a farm in Halam, Nottinghamshire. As she was tending to a cow with breathing difficulties, another cow charged at her and knocked her off her feet before trampling her left side. The farmer called an ambulance and she was taken to King’s Mill Hospital. She said she waited for 45 minutes in the walk-in area of the Accident and Emergency department before she was even assessed by a nurse. She added: ‘The nurse gave me some pain relief tablets and left me to sit in the waiting area. After a further hour-and-a-half wait I finally saw the doctor. ‘He listened to my chest and felt my ribs. He then picked a discharge card off the wall and told me I had bruised ribs, which would be sore for a while. ‘No X-ray was taken despite the magnitude of the injury and the nature of the force a half-ton cow can apply to a human body.’ Her mother Christine, 51, a pharmacist, said: ‘Her life was put at risk because a doctor failed to do his job properly. Anger: Amy Jennings has hit out at the care she received at Kings Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire . She was sent home with paracetamol. She could have died.’ Dr Ben Owens, service director for emergency care at Sherwood Forest Hospitals, which runs King’s Mill Hospital, has apologised to Miss Jennings. He said: ‘We will carry out a full and comprehensive investigation to understand what went wrong and where lessons can be learnt. We will continue to discuss with Miss Jennings the concerns she has and keep her informed of our investigation.’","Amy Jennings was crushed by a cow at a farm in Halam, Nottinghamshire .

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has slammed FIFA for their 'bad organisation' which has led to inconsistent fixture scheduling and poor pitches at the 2014 World Cup.

"By . Anna Magee . Forget a slim waist, great legs or glowing skin, the one thing that I have always coveted most in other women is smooth, shiny hair. At 44, I have spent most of my life battling my thick, frizzy mane — hair that, left to its own devices, would grow upwards and outwards, instead of down. I can still recall the blow-dry that changed my life: it was 1982, I was 13 and blissfully unaware that I had the bad hair gene. But that afternoon, my hairdresser produced a paddle brush and proceeded to blow-dry my hair straight. As shiny, smooth tendrils suddenly skimmed my collarbones, I had an epiphany: for the first time, I felt pretty. From frizzy to fabulous: Anna now has the sleek hair she's always yearned for . Ever since, I have devoted time and money to recreate that feeling, spending 90 minutes (though that time has more than halved) blow-drying my hair straight. I was convinced — still am — that people take me less seriously with my natural all-over-the-place curls, and when I have sleek hair, I exude a calmer, confident allure. What makes hair frizzy? Blame it partly on family, partly on environment. Mine was inherited from my coarse-haired Greek parents, and doubles in size in humidity and damp weather. I’ve been known to leave the house in a beanie hat, even in summer. ‘Even if hair has been blow-dried, as soon as moisture enters cuticles, the outermost layer, strands behave as they would naturally — in your case, twisting instead of lying straight,’ says trichologist Philip Kingsley. ‘There’s no cure for frizz, you can only use products to calm it.’ Believe me, over the past 31 years, I have tried every treatment and product. Some may not be cheap, others may not be easy, but as anyone with the frizzy gene will know, if they work, it’s worth it. Natural look: Anna aged 12 . I once left a salon looking like Cousin It from the Addams Family after a stylist said ‘all one length’ would help my hair drop (it didn’t). Another time, I emerged with more flicky-out layers than Lawrence Llewelyn-Bowen, and once, I went for a blunt fringe that left me looking like one of The Beatles.Then I met Tom Tsang at Smiths Salon in London’s Soho. He gently, and I mean gently, layered my hair in a way that thinned out all thickness, letting it fall evenly.‘Ask your hairdresser for long, soft layers with volume at the bottom,’ he says. ‘Tell them to cut texture in to combat “poofiness”, leaving layers with gentle movement.’ Harsh, cheap shampoos add to frizz, making hair coarser by upsetting the lay of the cuticle. Look for products free from sulphates, harsh detergents that make hair brittle and stiff. The best I have used is Pureology’s Super Smooth range, (shampoo, £13.86; conditioner £17.85), which also protects hair from frizz-aggravating UV damage. If I could take one hair product to a deserted island, it would be Bumble and Bumble Tonic Lotion, (£16). Even when my hair is due a cut, a few sprays of this when it’s wet will smooth instantly. Menthol and peppermint extracts prevent roots getting oily and it’s alcohol-free: great news, as alcohol increases frizz. Moroccan Oil burst on the scene to cult status about ten years ago. Argan oil is its best-known ingredient, but it also contains silicone polymers which calm frizz and protect from humidity. I apply it to towel-dried hair. I never use it on dry hair as it makes it greasy. Bad hair gene: Anna, (aged 19) would spend up to 90 minutes trying to tame her curls . I discovered Kerastase Fluide Oleo-Relax Slim Cream (£17.90) on a trip away with a sleek-haired friend who I would never have guessed was prone to frizz, till I saw her post-swim. A touch of this balm and her hair dried naturally into soft curls. The secret is scarcity. Too much will weigh hair down. It's expensive, but as a finisher on dry hair, nothing beats Alterna’s Caviar CC Cream (£21.20). In the same way a CC face cream evens out skin, this smooths flyaways and helps stop the puffy ‘helmet effect’ my blow-dry gets on humid days. I worship the paddle brush as it creates soft, breezy, straight hair. The standard is available from most brush shops, but I recently discovered the Kent AirHedz Pro (£10.20). The natural bristles are thick and hard, gripping hair for faster blow-dries, leaving a silkier result. I’m not a fan of straightening irons, as I find results short-lived, leaving hair straw-like. But I am a fan of ionic hair-dryers, as they emit negative ions which help the cuticle lie flat, giving that glossy effect. They cause water in wet hair to break down faster. Celebrity hairdresser Errol Douglas’s Infrared Dryer (£59.99) cut my straightening time from 25 to 15 minutes. Result. Coarse hair can often look dull from too much heat and product overload. My antidote is Palmer’s Coconut Oil Formula Strong Roots (£3.49), which adds gloss without weight. I stole the secret for this cheap beauty find from a make-up artist who not only uses it to spruce up coarse hair, but also to give skin a moisturised and radiant look. I feel pretty! After 31 years of searching Anna has found her frizzy hair's holy grail . Brazilian blow-dries, in which a straightening solution is painted on hair, have been hailed as the ultimate anti-frizz remedy. They are controversial as their active ingredient formaldehyde (used in embalming), can be carcinogenic if inhaled in large quantities. But I discovered a formaldehyde-free alternative — the Permanent Blow-Dry — at Hershesons, a top salon at Harvey Nichols in London. The £220 treatment uses a solution with natural keratin (the protein hair is made of) and glycolic acid (used in skincare). Research found it reduces frizz as it penetrates hair shafts and rebuilds keratin semi-permanently. Stylist Jenna Norman promises it will leave 70 per cent wave, but remove 100 per cent frizz. My hair was washed twice then blow-dried about 80 per cent dry, before being coated in a thick, white substance. It was left for 20 minutes then blow-dried, with the product in, before a once over with a straightening iron. The result was straight locks, which I was told not to ‘dent’ or wet for three days. By day three, my hair was so greasy, I couldn’t go out. But on the fourth, I shampooed and let my hair dry naturally: it dried with a gentle wave, and zero frizz. My picture for this piece was taken that day. Since then I have been caught in rain, sweated in the gym and not had to blow-dry my hair or go near it with a straightening iron. My hair is swishy and shiny with no effort, save a little towel-drying. Best of all, the effects should last around five months. After 30 years of searching, I’ve found my frizzy hair’s holy grail.","Anna has always coveted smooth, shiny hair .

The father of a 16-year-old boy sentenced to fifteen years in prison after taking part in an armed robbery says his son is a victim of bad legal advice and serves another chance. Cooper Van Huizen is currently in solitary confinement in a maximum security cell at the Utah State Prison after his sentencing earlier this month. Despite being a first time offender, he currently find himself in the same unit that houses death-row inmates, gang members, and other high profile offenders. Cooper Van Huizen of Roy, Utah, is facing up to fifteen years in prison after pleading guilty to taking part in an armed robbery. He parents claims they received bad legal advice . Van Huizen’s parents claim their son’s sentence is far too severe. They hope to appeal it and claim they received bad legal advice which recommended that their son plead guilty. ‘23 hours in a cell - that’s going to destroy him,’ Marc Van Huizen, told KSL about his son’s current predicament. Van Huizen was arrested last fall and accused of being part of a group that committed an armed robbery on November 4 at a home in Roy, Utah. Court documents said Cooper and four others - including three 18-year-olds - entered the home and held two people inside at gunpoint in the basement while they demanded money and drugs. Cooper Van Huizen is currently in solitary confinement in a maximum security cell at the Utah State Prison, in the same unit that houses death-row inmates, gang members, and other high profile offenders . Cooper Van Huizen was sentenced earlier this month to two 1-to-15 year concurrent prison sentences after he pleaded guilty to two reduced charges of second-degree felony robbery . Police said they left with $10, a wallet, a cellphone and a bag of marijuana. The teen was charged as an adult with two counts of aggravated robbery and one count of aggravated burglary - all first-degree felonies with a maximum penalty of up to life in prison. The Van Huizen’s lawyer recommended a plea deal, believing it would result in a 180-day jail sentence where their son would be able to attend school during the day. Instead, the judge sentenced him to two 1-to-15 year concurrent prison sentences after he pleaded guilty to two reduced charges of second-degree felony robbery. The teen cried: ‘No, please, no, please,’ as bailiffs handcuffed him and led him from the courtroom. Marc Van Huizen claim's that his family received poor legal advice and they wish to retract his son's guilty plea . A new defense attorney has asked the judge to reconsider the sentence and allow the teen to withdraw his guilty pleas. 'There was insufficient evidence to show that my son had any weapon of any kind,' Van Huizen said. He says that while others held 'broken' guns, his son was never armed, was never an instigator and was simply there because he ended up hanging out with the wrong group of friends. 'He himself now has complete remorse and regret, forever being a part of that situation and he wishes he could take that day back,' said Marc Van Huizen.

Aerial perspectives show off the ruined castles' striking features and interesting layouts, which were built for battles and were then adapted over the centuries - sometimes for parties. The Welsh government used the unmanned crafts to show off the country’s history from a unique perspective. Scroll down for video . Complicated: The lake defences of Caerphilly Castle (pictured) have been described as 'the most elaborate water defences in all Britain' and it is one of the largest castles of its kind in Europe . Laugharne Castle, which inspired poet Dylan Thomas and Caerphilly, one of the largest castles in Europe, are two of the castles featured in the videos. They are all examples of medieval fortifications and feature elaborate defences, such as Caerphilly’s network of moats and lakes to keep warring factions outside of its walls. Caerphilly's lakes have been described as ‘the most elaborate water defences in all of Britain’. An inspiration: Dylan Thomas use to visit Laugharne Castle (pictured) to pen poems when he had writer's block and his granddaughter said it was the view from there that 'would have inspired him most' St Davids Bishop’s Palace was built more with entertainment in mind as its great hall was designed by Bishop Henry de Gower to be the perfect backdrop for banquets. And while millions of people visit the sites every year, very few will have been able to see the magnificent castles from above. That is why Cadw, the Welsh Government’s historic environment service, took to the skies using drones to make the high resolution videos.

St Davids Bishop's Palace (pictured) conveys the affluence and power of the medieval church when religion was the order of the day . 'We’re always looking at new and exciting ways to bring Wales’s history to life and these videos are a good way of showcasing our incredible heritage sites from a different angle,’ said John Griffiths, Minister for Culture and Sport. ‘More than two and a half million people visit Cadw sites every year but few people will ever have had the opportunity to see them like this. ‘Wales’s historic environment gives character to our communities and strengthens a sense of belonging and identity, and we hope that these innovative videos will inspire people to explore their local heritage sites this summer.’ The Welsh government used the unmanned crafts to record the four castles, shown on the map . Laugharne Castle: The medieval castle turned Tudor mansion was built in the 13th century. Its grounds provided inspiration to both Dylan Thomas and Richard Hughes who put pen to paper in the castle’s garden summerhouse. Built by the de Brian family, the castle didn’t fare too well during the Civil War and was partially dismantled by Parliamentary forces after a siege. Kidwelly Castle: The earliest castle on this site was Norman and built around 1115 AD it was rebuilt in stone in the 13th century. The aerial video shows how Kidwelly benefited from the latest thinking in castle design. It had a concentric design with one circuit of defensive walls set within another to allow the castle to be held even if the outer wall should fall.

The video shows a memorial to Princess Gwenllian just outside the Gatehouse. Gwenllian died in battle in 1136, fighting the lord of the castle, Maurice de Londres and is sometimes depicted rising a chariot or with a sword in her hand, a little like Boudicca.

"By . Suzannah Hills . The world's oldest crown believed to be more than 6000-years-old has gone on display for the first time in America. The ancient relic, which dates back to the Copper Age between 4000–3300 B.C., is shaped like a thick ring and features vultures and doors protruding from the top. It is believed the crown played a part in burial ceremonies for people of importance at the time. The crown was discovered in a remote cave in the Judaean Desert near the Dead Sea in 1961 among hundreds of other objects from the period. The world's oldest crown: This headpiece dating back to the Copper Age between 4000-3300 B.C. was found in a remote cave in the Judaean Desert in Israel in 1961 . Moment of discovery: Pessah Bar-Adon from the Israel Department of Antiquities pictured in the so-called Cave of the Treasure in the Judaean Desert in Israel shortly after discovering the hoard of items from the Copper Age in 1961 . Known as the 'Nahal Mishar Hoard', more than 400 objects were discovered by Pessah Bar-Adon and his fellow Israeli archaeologists in the cave which became known as the 'Cave of the Treasure'. The pieces included two clay statues of Gods - The Lady and Ram of Gilat - and a full array of Copper Age figurines made from copper, stone, elephant ivory and clay. There was also a scepter decorated with horned animals, clay goblets and bowls. It has been suggested that the hoard was the sacred treasure belonging to a shrine at Ein Gedi, some twelve kilometers away. The purpose of the hoard remains a mystery, it may have been to keep them protected in an emergency, although it is believed the objects may have been used in public ceremonies. Around 150 artefacts from the collection can be seen at New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World as part of the 'Masters of Fire: Copper Age Art from Israel' exhibit which runs until June 8. Huge hoard: Archaeologists discovered more than 400 items hidden within the cave . Other discoveries: Among the other items discovered in the cave was a libation vessel in the shape of a woman carrying a churn, pictured left, and a fenestrated stand with three bowls and sculpted motifs, pictured right . Daniel M. Master, Professor of Archaeology at Wheaton College and a member of the curatorial team, said: 'The fascinating thing about this period is that a burst of innovation defined the technologies of the ancient world for thousands of years. 'People experimented with new ways to use not just copper, but also leather, ceramics, and textiles - sometimes successfully, sometimes not.' Jennifer Y. Chi, ISAW Exhibitions Director and Chief Curator, added: 'To the modern eye, it's stunning to see how these groups of people, already mastering so many new social systems and technologies, still had the ability to create objects of enduring artistic interest.' The exhibit also features objects from the Peqi’in Cave, another important discovery site. The most significant finds included are eight ossuaries, or burial containers, for human skeletal remains. Some were designed to look like human faces or figures and all are decorated with red stripes or zigzag patterns. These ossuaries held the bones of more than one person - the vast majority were men. Those who had their bones stored would have held positions of importance within society.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . If you thought Mars was the best place in the solar system to find signs of life, you might need to think again. The largest moon in our solar system, a companion to Jupiter named Ganymede, might have ice and oceans stacked up in several layers like a club sandwich. And the Nasa-funded research suggests that this may have once been a suitable environment for primitive life. Scroll down for animation . Steve Vance and his team showed that ice and water under the surface has different densities. At the top is the lightest 'Ice I' that is similar to ice cubes in your drink, ranging to the heaviest and densest 'Ice VI' that would sink to the bottom of the sea . Previously, . the moon was thought to harbour a thick ocean sandwiched between just . two layers of ice, one on top and one on bottom, but now it seems it has . multiple layers. The study, led by Steve Vance of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, provides new theoretical evidence for the team's ‘club sandwich’ model, first proposed last year. The Nasa-funded research modelling the moon's makeup supports idea that primitive life might have possibly arisen on the icy moon. Scientists say that places where water and rock interact are important for the development of life . For example, it's possible life began on Earth in bubbling vents on our sea floor. Prior to the new study, Ganymede's rocky sea bottom was thought to be coated with ice, not liquid - a problem for the emergence of life. The 'club sandwich' findings suggest otherwise: the first layer on top of the rocky core might be salty water. 'This is good news for Ganymede,' said Vance. 'Its ocean is huge, with enormous pressures, so it was thought that dense ice had to form at the bottom of the ocean. 'When we added salts to our models, we came up with liquids dense enough to sink to the sea floor.' Ganymede is one of Jupiter's four largest satellites known as the Galilean moons. From left to right in this artist's mosaic they are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. They are pictured above the Great Red Spot, a storm on Jupiter that has been raging for over 400 years . Nasa scientists first suspected an ocean in Ganymede in the 1970s, based on models of the large moon, which is bigger than Mercury. In the 1990s, Nasa's Galileo mission flew by Ganymede, confirming the moon's ocean, and showing it extends to depths of hundreds of miles. The spacecraft also found evidence for salty seas, likely containing the salt magnesium sulfate. Previous models of Ganymede's oceans assumed that salt didn't change the properties of liquid very much with pressure. Ganymede is one of five moons in our solar system thought to support vast oceans beneath icy crusts. The other moons are Jupiter's Europa and Callisto and Saturn's Titan and Enceladus. The . European Space Agency (Esa) is developing a space mission, called . Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice), pictured above, to visit Europa, . Callisto and Ganymede in the . 2030s. Nasa and JPL are contributing to three instruments on the mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2022. The lightest ice is on top, and the saltiest liquid is heavy enough to sink to the bottom. What's more, the results demonstrate a possible bizarre phenomenon that causes the oceans to 'snow upwards.' As the . oceans churn and cold plumes snake around, ice in the uppermost ocean . layer, called 'Ice III,' could form in the seawater. When . ice forms, salts precipitate out. The heavier salts would fall . downwards, and the lighter ice, or 'snow,' would float upwards. This 'snow' melts again before reaching the top of the ocean, possibly leaving slush in the middle of the moon sandwich. Sotin and Vance are both members of . the Icy Worlds team at JPL, part of the multi-institutional Nasa . Astrobiology Institute based at the Ames Research Center in Moffett . Field, California. The results can be applied to exoplanets too, planets that circle stars beyond our sun. Some super-Earths, rocky planets more massive than Earth, have been proposed as 'water worlds' covered in oceans. Vance . and his team think laboratory experiments and more detailed modeling of . exotic oceans might help find answers as to whether they could have . life. Jupiter's Ganymede, artist's illustration of the interior pictured, is the largest moon in the solar system. Although it was previously thought to have an underground ocean, new research from Nasa suggests it may actually have layers of ice of different density surrounding its subsurface seas that may have hosted life . It may . seem strange that salt can make the ocean denser, but you can see for . yourself how this works by adding plain old table salt to a glass of . water. Rather than increasing in volume, the liquid shrinks and becomes denser. This is because the salt ions attract water molecules. The models get more complicated when the different forms of ice are taken into account. The ice that floats in your drinks is called 'Ice I.' It's the least dense form of ice and lighter than water. But at high pressures, like those in crushingly deep oceans like Ganymede's, the ice crystal structures become more compact. 'It's . like finding a better arrangement of shoes in your luggage - the ice . molecules become packed together more tightly,' said Vance. The . ice can become so dense that it is heavier than water and falls to the . bottom of the sea. The densest and heaviest ice thought to persist in . Ganymede is called 'Ice VI.' By . modeling these processes using computers, the team came up with an . ocean sandwiched between up to three ice layers, in addition to the . rocky seafloor.","Nasa researchers have discovered that Ganymede's subsurface is layered .
They say that it has different densities of ice surrounding a vast ocean .
At the top is ice similar to that in your drink, while densest is at bottom .
This could have created a bizarre scenario where it 'snowed upwards'
The research also suggests this watery layer was ideal for primitive life .
And it could help us discover habitable planets outside the solar system ."
"By . Jennifer Newton . Pope Francis has told the head of the United Nations that it must do more to help the poor and redistribute wealth. In a meeting with the U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon today, he called on the world’s governments to promote an ‘ethical mobilisation’ of solidarity with those less well-off and adopt a new spirit of generosity to address the causes of poverty and hunger. The pontiff made his comments in an address to Mr Ban and the leaders of several U.N. agencies who were all meeting in Rome. Pope Francis meets with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in Rome today . Pope Francis then listens as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon makes his speech in the Vatican . Pope Francis said: ‘In the case of global political and economic organisation, much more needs to be achieved, since an important part of humanity does not share in the benefits of progress and is in fact relegated to the status of second-class citizens. ‘I urge you to work together in promoting a true, worldwide ethical mobilisation which, beyond all differences of religious or political convictions, will spread and put into practice a shared ideal of fraternity and solidarity, especially with regard to the poorest and those most excluded.’ He also told the U.N. officials that while there had been a welcome decrease in extreme poverty and improvements in education ‘the world's people deserve and expect even greater results’. The Pope said in his speech that the world should work together in promoting a true, worldwide ethical mobilisation . He said a contribution to equitable . development could be made ‘both by international activity aimed at the . integral human development of all of the world's people and by the . legitimate redistribution of economic benefits by the State.’ ‘An awareness of everyone's human dignity should encourage everyone to share with complete freedom the goods which God's providence has placed in our hands,’ Francis added. Pope Francis has consistently used his meetings with world leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama, to champion the cause of the world's poorest. The Pope, who was known as the ‘slum bishop’ in his native Buenos Aires because of his frequent visits to shanty towns, has often said since his election that he wants the Catholic Church to be closer to the poor. In the past 14 months since his election, Francis has issued several strong attacks on the global economic system, saying in one speech last September that it could no longer be based on ‘a god called money’. The Pontiff, pictured during his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square on Wednesday, has often championed the cause of the poor .","Called on the world to do more to help the poorest people .

The McCanns have decorated the front gates at their home in Rothley, Leicestershire, with green and yellow floral tributes, symbolising hope. Unending grief: Kate McCann seen here in Praia da Luz last week . In a TV interview last week, Mrs McCann said: ‘The family will get together and celebrate, which is wonderful, but Madeleine should be here. ‘We still celebrate her and her being part of our lives. I go into Madeleine’s room and I don’t even have to talk – I can just think. It’s as it was really and I’m not ready to change it.’ The McCanns try to keep life as normal as possible for the sake of their eight-year-old twins, Sean and Amelie. Still missing: Madeleine McCann aged three in 2007 before she disappeared while on holiday with her parents .

"By . Leon Watson . Fighter jets had to be scrambled twice after Russian bombers practised off the coast of Alaska and then came within 50 miles of California, it emerged today. The North American Aerospace Defense Command confirmed U.S. air defense systems were triggered twice by nuclear-capable Tu-95 Bear H aircraft last week. A spokesman said incursions began on Monday at around 4.30pm . Pacific time when radar detected four bombers . approaching the U.S. air defense zone near the far western Aleutian . Islands. In this U.S. Navy stock picture, a F-18 Hornet strike fighter intercepts a Russian Tu-95 Bear long rang bomber . Two U.S. Air Force F-22 jets were scrambled and intercepted the  turbo-prop powered bombers over the Aleutians. Two of the Bears, believed to be based at the Russian strategic base near Anadyr, Russia, turned around and headed west toward the Russian Far East . The remaining two bombers then flew south-east. At around 9.30pm they entered the U.S. northern air defense zone off the coast of Northern California. The USAF air defense systems were trigged for a second time and two U.S. F-15 jets were deployed. They intercepted the bombers before they turned around and . headed west. Norad spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis told the Washington Free Beacon: 'The last time we saw anything similar was two years ago on the Fourth of July.' A defense official said the four bombers also were supported by two IL-78 aerial refueling tankers that were used for mid-air refueling during the operation this week. A U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor aircraft had to intercept two Tu-95 Bear H aircraft last week . The Tu-95 is a long-range strike aircraft capable of carrying nuclear cruise missiles. Other versions are equipped with intelligence-gathering sensors and electronic warfare gear. It has a range of around 9,400 miles without refueling. Davis said the aircraft 'acted professionally' and the bombers appeared to be conducting a training mission. 'They typically do long range aviation training in the summer and it is not unusual for them to be more active during this time,' he said. 'We assess this was part of training. And they did not enter territorial airspace.' A U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor aircraft executing a supersonic flyby . The bomber incursion is the latest Russian nuclear saber-rattling amid stepped up tensions over Moscow's military annexation of Ukraine's Crimea. Texas Republican Mike Conaway, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, called the Russian flights 'intentional provocations', the Washington Free Beacon reported. 'Putin is doing this specifically to try to taunt the U.S. and exercise, at least in the reported world, some sort of saber-rattling, muscle-flexing kind of nonsense. Truth of the matter is we would have squashed either one of those [bombers] like baby seals.' 'It's a provocation and it's unnecessary. But it fits in with [Putin's] macho kind of saber-rattling,' he said, adding that he expects Russia will carry out more of these kinds of incidents in the future. The Tu-95 Bear is the fastest propeller-driven airplane ever built. It was originally designed to carry two nuclear bombs to targets in the continental U.S. Later versions carried cruise missiles for long-range . stand-off missions. The Bear has also been used for reconnaissance, . especially by the Soviet/Russian Navy which used the aircraft to locate . U.S. aircraft carrier task forces. Last month, in a . maneuver straight out of the Cold War, a Russian fighter jet purposely . flew 100-feet in front of the nose of an American spy plane in April, US . officials confirmed on Monday. The fly-by over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan was described by one US official as 'straight out of a movie'. The . same U.S. official said the Russian jet put the lives of the US Air Force . RC-135U in danger and called it 'one of the most dangerous close passes . in decades.' It is the . latest source of concern for U.S. officials since a heightening of . U.S.-Russian tensions following Moscow's intervention in Ukraine. In mid-April a Russian Su-24 fighter made low-level passes over a U.S. Navy ship in the Black Sea. An RC-135U is a highly specialized reconnaissance plane known as 'Combat Sent.' There are only two such planes in the U.S. Air Force; both are assigned to the 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Their . crews are from the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron and the 97th . Intelligence Squadron of the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and . Reconnaissance Agency. The . 'Combat Sent' aircraft are equipped with communications gear designed . to locate and identify foreign military radar signals on land, at sea . and in the air. The . crew is composed of two pilots, one navigator, two airborne systems . engineers, at least 10 electronic warfare officers and six or more . technical and other specialists.","Air defense systems triggered twice by Tu-95 Bear H aircraft .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Children's faces pressed against glass. Young boys and girls sleeping under blankets wall-to-wall on concrete floors. The pungent odor that comes with keeping travelers in close quarters. These were the sights from a Wednesday tour of a crowded Border Patrol station in south Texas where thousands of immigrants are being held before they are transferred to shelters across the U.S. It was the first time the media was given access to the facility since President Obama called the more than 47,000 unaccompanied children who have entered the country illegally this budget year an 'urgent humanitarian situation'. Scroll down for video . Overcrowded: Children sleep under red cross blankets on the floor of a Border Patrol center in Texas . Overwhelmed: Children, many from Central America, color pictures at the center. Border Patrol stations have been overrun with immigrant children in the past year . Border Patrol stations like the one in Brownsville were not meant for long-term custody. Immigrants are supposed to wait there until they are processed and taken to detention centers. But the surge in children arriving without their parents has overwhelmed the government. The surge, which has been building for three years, comes amid a steep overall increase in immigrant arrests in southernmost Texas. The children are mostly from Central America. They pose a particular challenge because the law requires Customs and Border Protection to transfer them to the Department of Health and Human Services within 72 hours. That agency's network of about 100 shelters around the country has been over capacity for months and is now caring for more than 7,600 children. Waiting: Illegal immigrant children are held in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma being moved to shelters . Contact: An officer helps boys make phone calls as they try to reach relatives who could take over their care . Laundry room: Piles of clean clothes and towels are stacked up for the immigrants close to the showering area . Children began backing up in already overcrowded Border Patrol stations. Eventually, the Border Patrol began flying them to Arizona, where it set up a processing center. From there, they are sent to private shelters or temporary housing at barracks on military bases in California, Texas and Oklahoma. But the children who were at Fort Brown on Wednesday remain in the custody of an agency ill-equipped to care for them. Dozens of young boys were divided from dozens of young girls. Mothers with children still younger were in another cell. Happier faces could be found in a side yard just outside the station. There, young children colored pictures under a camouflage tent. Caring: Two boys are helped to pick out clothing after arriving at a border placement center in Arizona . Supplies: Stacks of boxes full of children's clothes are at the Border Patrol station, where thousands of youngsters are being held . Waiting: Those staying at the overcrowded center will be transferred to cities across the U.S. A group of about a dozen girls of perhaps 5 or 6 sat under another tent outside the shower trailer, dark hair wet and shiny. Women wearing blue gloves combed each girl's hair. Tables held stacks of clean jeans, T-shirts and toiletries. Deeper into the yard, teen girls kicked a soccer ball with workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Between October and May, 162,000 people from countries 'other than Mexico' have entered the U.S. across the southern border, Fox News reported. Among them were 47,017 unaccompanied children, sent by family in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador or Nicaragua to join relatives already in the U.S. Most of the children are turning themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents, who transport them to a facility where they are given 'notices to appear' before an immigration judge between 10 and 90 days later. HHS takes over after that, drawing on a $1 billion budget to house, feed and otherwise care for the children until a suitable adult family member can be located to claim them. Packed in: The surge in numbers of unaccompanied children arriving has put pressure on the centers . HHS, which houses them until family members can be found, has begun releasing illegal immigrant children 'by the hundreds' into the custody of adults who are illegal immigrants themselves, an HHS official familiar with the situation on America's southern border told MailOnline late on Tuesday. An official spokesman for HHS's Administration for Children and Families confirmed on Wednesday that the agency has no system in place to verify whether the adults are here legally. Kenneth Wolfe told MailOnline that 'around 90 percent of the minors in the UAC program are released to verified sponsors (mostly family members) in the U.S.' Asked if 'verified' means that the adults' immigration status has been checked, he responded, 'No.'He also answered 'no' when asked if there is 'an effort made to ascertain the immigration status of the adults who claim the kids.' Resources: Staff try to keep the children clean and clothed as they go through the immigration processing centers . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took issue with what appears to be an unprecedented immigration policy-in-the-making on Tuesday night during a town hall broadcast on CNN. 'They should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are,' Clinton said of the children. She told question-and-answer moderator Christiane Amanpour that 'all of them that can be should be reunited with their families' in their home countries. 'We have to send a clear message,' Clinton said: 'Just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay.'","Centers are housing tens of thousands of youngsters from Central America .

An 11-year-old boy remains in a critical but stable condition in Auckland's Starship Hospital after he was injured during a fight at  Pacific Christian School in Mangere, south Auckland on Tuesday. The boy has a head injury, but police said they can't comment further about the specifics of the injury or how it was inflicted. Police officers at Pacific Christian School in Mangere, Auckland where an 11-year-old boy was reportedly stabbed with scissors on Tuesday . It's been reported he was stabbed in the head with a pair of scissors by a boy of a similar age when the fight broke out around 11.30am. Police and Child Youth and Family (CYF) are working with the 11-year-old boy believed to be involved in the fight and police say the boy's parents are cooperating fully to manage his ongoing care. The stabbing was witnessed by a number of the boys' classmates and a joint police, CYF and Ministry of Education team will be working with those children and their families over the coming days to conduct interviews and provide them with the support. Due to the ages of the children, specialist child interviewers will be required. The school is run by local Tongan churchTokaikolo Christian Church . Police hope to complete their scene examination at the school on Wednesday. Pacific Christian School has been open since 2005, when it began as a pre-school and primary school before it expanded enrollment to include intermediate and secondary grades. The school is understood to be run by the Tokaikolo Christian Church, a well-known Tongan church in Mangere, Auckland. According to The New Zealand Herald, the church made headlines in back in 2012 when the president came under fire for calling on the congregation to raise money for the church, believed to be around $100,000 a month. The injured schoolboy is still in a critical but stable condition as police continue their investigation .","A fight is believed to have broken out between two classmates on Tuesday .

Gina has has been embroiled in an ongoing feud with three of her four children, John, Bianca and Hope, over the family fortune left by her father, mining magnate Lang Hancock. Scroll down for video . Bianca Rinehart, the eldest daughter of Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, appeared at Sydney's Supreme Court on Tuesday to argue why she should be allowed to take control of a $5 billion family trust . Appearing as the first witness in the case, lodged three years ago, Bianca Rinehart defended her brother's comments, despite having told her mother in 2004 she was 'deeply concerned about (his) reckless bite the hand that feeds you approach'. Bianca, who had temporarily fallen out with Mr Hancock, told the court: '(It's) not a personal attack.' She added that her brother's drinking and gambling problems had been 'damaging in the past'. 'He doesn't want to see the family business left in the hands of someone ... he feels isn't up to the job,' she said.

The court heard their mother Gina reportedly sent Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett an email encouraging him to convince Bianca to withdraw her bid to control the trust rather 'than be found a liar in the witness box' Mr Hancock and Bianca allege their mother Gina acted 'deceitfully' and with 'gross dishonesty' in her dealings with the trust, set up in 1988 by her father, Lang Hancock, with her children as the beneficiaries . Bianca told the court that Hope had emailed her brother in February 2013 saying: 'All . I feel is pain and anxiety. You are kicking me in the stomach.' Ms .

"By . Emma Innes . NHS Direct in England is to close at the end of March next year, it has been announced. The much-maligned service said in July it was pulling out of contracts to provide the 111 non-emergency number service due to financial problems. NHS Direct initially won 11 of the 46 regional contracts for the 111 service, covering 34 per cent of the country’s population. NHS Direct in England is to close at the end of the financial year, it has been announced . It pulled out of two services and said in July the remaining nine were ‘financially unsustainable’. The 111 service is run by different organisations in each area, including private companies and ambulance trusts, who will now take on NHS Direct’s work. In a statement, NHS Direct said its 111 staff and call centres were due to transfer to five ambulance trusts by the end of November. NHS Direct used to be paid more than £20 per call when it ran the old 0845 number, which will officially cease in March. The payment for the 111 service is around £7 to £9 per call. The statement said: ‘No patient services will be affected by the board’s decision, as we expect each of the services that NHS Direct is commissioned to provide beyond March 2014 to be transferred to other organisations, together with the staff who provide them.’ The organisation said it would launch a formal consultation with staff on Monday but ‘it is hoped that the number of redundancies arising will be kept to a minimum through transfer and redeployment of staff to other organisations’. It said the decision to close had been reached in agreement with the NHS Trust Development Authority and NHS England. The NHS Direct help line was launched by Tony Blair in Liverpool in December 1999 (pictured) Chair of NHS Direct Joanne Shaw said: ‘The closure of NHS Direct marks the end of its 15 years of continuous innovation, during which time it has led the world in remote health assessment, advice and information. ‘It is an enormous privilege to have been part of this journey, and I look back over my 10 years with NHS Direct with gratitude and respect for the staff who have created this exceptional service. ‘I look forward to seeing other organisations take forward a number of the services developed by NHS Direct, and I wish them well as they exploit the ever-growing reach and power of technology, to provide value to patients and the NHS.’ NHS Direct in Wales is unaffected by the announcement. In the West Midlands, the West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust will take on NHS Direct’s work, with private firm Harmoni providing the service for the Worcester area and Staffordshire Doctors Urgent Care Ltd. The service said in July it was pulling out of contracts to provide the 111 non-emergency number service due to financial problems . The North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust will take on the contract for the North West, while Somerset will be taken care of by the South West Ambulance Service NHS Trust.Plans for London and Buckinghamshire are being finalised and will be announced shortly. NHS England said its latest data showed a ‘significant improvement’ in the 111 service compared with the period just after it launched in April. Some 94.1 per cent of calls are answered within 60 seconds, 92 per cent of callers say they are satisfied with the service and 0.5 per cent of calls are abandoned, it said. Overall, 93 per cent of the population has the NHS 111 service. The four areas not covered - Cambridge and Peterborough, North Essex, Bedfordshire and Luton and Cornwall - will be up and running by February. Dame Barbara Hakin, deputy chief executive at NHS England, said: ‘NHS 111 is now a stable and improving service and we are confident it will continue to get better. ‘It is no secret that we had a tough start but I have been impressed by the way that the staff providing these services across the country have turned the situation around on behalf of the public. ‘Now NHS 111 provides a good service with high levels of public satisfaction. ‘Calls are answered promptly and more people are getting access to the service as we move to full coverage in February 2014. ‘I am confident, and the public should be too, that these new providers of NHS 111 will be able to deliver a smooth transfer and a high quality, reliable 111 service. ‘The public should not feel any detrimental effects. ‘NHS 111 is now going from strength to strength and we are determined to keep that improvement on track.’","NHS Direct in England will close at the end of the financial year in March .

"By . Louise Cheer . Terrifying footage has emerged of a Queensland restaurant owner's family and staff being racially abused by a man. In video aired on Channel 9's A Current Affair, a man is seen storming into Indian Mehfil restaurant in Ipswich, west of Brisbane, while hurtling abuse at the people inside. The restaurant's owner Raj Sharma is seen calling the police on his mobile phone and trying to diffuse the situation before the man's friend pulls him away. Scroll down for video . Indian Mehfil's owner Raj Sharma tries to shield his staff and family from the man as he storms in on Tuesday afternoon . But before he leaves, the man picks a chair and hurls it through the restaurant's entrance on Brisbane St - one of the main streets in the city. Mr Sharma told MailOnline it was the not first time he and his staff have been racially abused, but this was the the first time it had involved his family. The incident escalated after a group of young people started racially abusing his two children, aged 6 and 8, who were playing outside. They ran into the restaurant to tell their mother before she went out to investigate. The group then started abusing her. The man is then seen abusing and gesturing aggressively at people inside the restaurant. At one point he says 'I'll f**cking deck you' Mr Sharma says his wife and children were spat on during the tirade that took place at the Ipswich Indian restaurant . Mr Sharma said they told his family to 'go back to their own country' and called them 'f**king curry munchers'. He said the group of young people also spat on his wife and children during the attack. 'It’s terrifying what is happening,' Mr Sharma said. '(The man) looked like he wasn't in control of what he was saying at the time.' Tuesday's incident follows the bashing of Indian Mehfil's chef and the stabbing of its manager last week. Both of which Mr Sharma believes were racially motivated. 'This needs to stop. They need to be thrown out of the city,' Mr Sharma told A Current Affair. The restaurant owner said he would now be hiring security guards to ensure the safety of his staff and family. Before he left their attacker picks up a chair and prepares to hurl it through the entrance . After that the man is dragged away by a friend . Queensland's Minister for Multiculturalism Glen Elmes and Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale have both condemned the attack. 'The government takes this kind of racial abuse very seriously,' Mr Elmes said. Mayor Pisasale sent out a stern warning to those responsible for the attacks. 'I'm going to tell those people we're going to catch you and tell them the court's going to deal with you and we're going to show the rest of Australia we're not going to tolerate any stupid behaviour in this city,' he said. Queensland Police have charged a 22-year-old and 20-year-old man in relation to the incident. The first man, from Leichhardt, has been charged with public nuisance and the second man, from Bundamba, has been charged with violent behaviour. Both will appear at Ipswich Magistrates Court on July 16.

"By . Jason Groves . Powerful enemy: Alienating Mrs Merkel, whose power in Europe is almost unrivalled, could damage the PM's chance of bringing about change . David Cameron’s hopes of renegotiating Britain’s role in the EU suffered a major blow yesterday as Tory MEPs teamed up with Germany’s answer to Ukip. In a snub to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, they agreed to form a group in the European Parliament with Alternativ fur Deutschland (AfD), Eurosceptics who are implacably opposed to Mrs Merkel. Alienating Mrs Merkel, whose power in Europe is almost unrivalled, could seriously damage the Prime Minister’s chance of bringing about change. A Tory spokesman last night said it was ‘very disappointing’ that the European Conservatives and Reform group had  chosen to accept AfD – although some Tory MEPs are thought to have voted for it. The rift with Mrs Merkel undermines Mr Cameron’s bid to rough out a new deal with Europe before his planned in/out  referendum on EU membership in 2017. Mats Persson, of think-tank Open Europe, said the decision to cosy up to the AfD was ‘not helpful at all’ to Mr Cameron. He went on to say: ‘If the objective is sweeping reform of the EU, for which you need Angela Merkel’s support, then it is not a good idea to team up with a party that is actively campaigning against her in her own country.’ The decision also scuppers an informal deal between the two leaders in which Mrs Merkel would soft-pedal on her support for arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker, her favoured candidate for  European Commission president, in return for Mr Cameron vetoing a deal with AfD by Tories in the European Parliament.","Alienating powerful Angela Merkel could scupper PM's hope for change .

"By . Freya Noble . Following a day full of crazy weather, wild winds and a whole lot of snow on Tuesday Mother Nature has now calmed down a little and the worst is said to be over. The severe weather warning for Victoria has been cancelled, but is expected to be re-issued later in the week with a new cold front on the way. The Victorian State Emergency Service received thousands of calls for help since the early hours of Tuesday, and more than 80,000 homes were also left without power across the state. Scroll down for video . The severe weather warning for Victoria was downgraded on Wednesday but is expected to be re-issued later in the week . The State Emergency Service in Victoria have responded to over 3800 requests for help since early Tuesday . Trampolines being picked up by gusts of wind were a 'repeat offender' across NSW and Victoria . Most calls across NSW were for trees down and damaged roofs . SES spokesman Stephan Delatovic told the Daily Mail Australia 'all up yesterday we responded to 3800 calls for help.' Mr Delatovic encouraged people to tie down outdoor furniture and said the SES 'did see quite a few jobs of trampolines and sheds lifted up by the wind and thrown around.' 'The effort of tying stuff down is much less than the heartache of dealing with damaged houses or injuries.' He warned that despite the severe weather warning being lifted, coastal areas are still 'unpredictable and dangerous' as there had been cases of jettys and boardwalks being washed out. The wild weather wreaked the worst havoc in Bacchus Marsh, Werribee, Point Cook, Bendigo, Bundoora, Watsonia North, Monbulk and the Mornington Peninsula, and a woman was injured when a brick wall fell on her in Yarraville. Victorian SES responded to many calls of trampolines and sheds being thrown around by the wind . Overnight 80,000 homes across Victoria lost power due to the severe storms . The NSW SES said the Illawarra South Coast were hardest hit by the wild weather . In Melbourne walls were torn down by severe winds . In Mittagong, located in the Southern Highlands of NSW, a man has been airlifted to hospital after a brick wall fell on him. The 10 metre high structure is believed to have collapsed due to high winds in the area. Emergency services responded to the call at Cavndish St, Mittagong on Wednesday afternoon and the man in his 50s is in a serious condition after the accident. He was trapped under the brick wall for over an hour-and-a-half, and was then flown by helicopter to Liverpool Hospital in a serious but stable condition, emergency services said. The SES are still working through the backlog of calls for assistance, with more than 250 requests which still need to be attended to.

The collapse was said to have been caused by high winds in the Southern Highlands area . The man is now in a serious but stable condition . Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Kevin Parkyn said the intense weather system affecting the whole state hits Victoria only once every few years. 'We're in for a windy week, so it's not over yet, although we have seen the most intense winds for the week,' Mr Parkyn said. But despite the winds slackening, emergency services continue to urge Victorians to stay clear of coastal areas with the weather expected to worsen later in the week. As for New South Wales, the state is still on alert and the State Emergency Service 'has received over 850 requests for assistance since yesterday morning,' according to their Facebook page.

'Illawarra and South Coast have been the worst hit with more than half the jobs there.' she said. The majority of the requests for help are for trees down, roof damage and 'trampolines are a repeat offender,' Ms Pritchard said. Surf and marine conditions are still extremely dangerous across both NSW and Victoria and people are being urged to stay out of the weather where they can. Meantime, snow is continuing to fall in ski fields in NSW, with Perisher, which is 200km south of Canberra, reporting they have now had more than 120cm of snow. Perisher ski fields saw another snow storm on Wednesday which brought with it over a metre of fresh snow . Following heavy snow on Tuesday the powder is continuing to fall at Perisher .

"By . Wills Robinson . A former Scotland Yard detective says the man wanted in connection with the disappearance of Madeleine McCann wore a rare long-sleeve t-shirt designed by a beer company. Peter Bleksley, 54, a founding member of the Metropolitan Police's undercover unit, believes the 'pot-bellied' suspect had a shirt with a logo from the Portuguese drinks company Super Bock. The revelation comes a week before the seven anniversary of her disappearance from a Praia de Luz in the Algarve. He is said to have worn the distinctive burgundy shirt on two occasions in Vale . de Parra and Praia da Gale, with one witness saying the clothing had a white circle on it. Revelation: A former Scotland Yard detective believes he has discovered more details of the burgundy shirt (mock image right) that was said to be worn by a suspect linked with Madeleine's disappearance . The suspect has been linked with attacks on another five British girls and is said to have targeted 12 families in the region between 2004 and 2010. The victims – including a . ten-year-old molested in Praia da Luz – were sexually assaulted and . there was one ‘near miss’ when the intruder was disturbed in . neighbouring resorts. Police have received more than 500 calls about attacks that could be linked to the unidentified man, but the detail of the shirt's design could be a significant development in the search for the girl, who would now be 10-years old. The circular logo has the manufacturer's name on a maroon background and can be seen in bars and pubs around Portugal. Mr Bleksley told the Sunday Express: 'Some people have suggested it bore resemblance to a strip once worn by the Arsenal football team. Possible locations: A number of claims concering alleged attacks have been made along the southern coast of Algarve, many of them in resorts popular with British tourists . Struggle: Kate and Gerry McCann  will mark the seventh anniversary of Maddie's disappearance this week . 'However, I think a more likely explanation could be that the man was wearing one of these Super Bock promotional t-shirts. Revelation: The Met previously released an image of the shirt which witnesses said the suspect could have been wearing . 'Therefore . it would be possible to check back on all the designs and the years . they were produced and see which one bears most similarity to that . witnessed by families. The suspect, who is said to have broken into the apartments of . five young girls to assault them believe he may be a local binman described as ‘smelly and pot-bellied’. The tanned, dark-haired man is suspected . of breaking into holiday properties where British families were staying . and sexually abusing five white British girls aged between seven and . 10, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said last month. The mystery man is also said to have ‘a vile interest in young, white, female children’. Since launching an appeal into other alleged attacks, six other British . families have come forward to report that their children aged six to 12 . fell victim to the offender over the same period. Scotland Yard are hoping to begin ‘operational activity’ on the . ground in Portugal, raising hopes that arrests could be imminent. The McCann family will mark the seventh anniversary of her disappearance this week. Her mother, Kate, will relive her heartache on Thursday during an interview with Lorraine Kelly. Madeleine would be ten-years-old, but her mother still believes she will be found. Hopes: Madeleine would now be ten-years-old and the increase in operational activity from Scotland Yard could lead to more arrests . A source close to Kate told The Daily Star on Sunday: 'She wants to speak from the heart to thank the public for their continued support over these seven difficult years and to viewers she still hopes Madeleine will be found. The couple's spokesman Clarence Mitchell said yesterday: 'There is lots of information that still needs to be checked and Kate and Gerry . Madeleine disappeared from her family’s . holiday apartment on May 3, 2007, as her parents Kate and Gerry dined at . a nearby restaurant. Scotland Yard declined to comment on the new allegations, but said anyone with information should call police on 020 7321 9251 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Police would not reveal what the operations will involve.

"By . Rebecca Camber . Updated: . 04:06 EST, 15 December 2011 . Vanished: Madeleine McCann disappeared from Praia da Luz in Portugal in 2007 . The News of the World’s former editor said yesterday he believed he had permission to publish the extracts from Kate McCann’s diary that she later said had left her feeling ‘mentally raped’. Colin Myler said he was told he had full support for publishing a story from Clarence Mitchell, the press spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, whose daughter Madeleine disappeared from Praia da Luz, in Portugal, in 2007. Mr Myler told the Leveson press standards inquiry he had ‘nothing to gain and everything to lose’ from upsetting the couple, having developed a good relationship with them. Mr Myler, who edited the News of the World from 2007 until it closed this year, said: ‘I stressed that I did not want Kate to come out of church on Sunday morning and find that the diaries were there without her knowledge.’ Mrs McCann’s diary was published in the News of the World on September 14, 2008. She told the inquiry last month that . when she saw it published she felt ‘violated’. Her husband said: ‘Kate . was distraught and in her words felt “mentally raped”.’ The . McCanns said Mr Mitchell was told by the paper’s Head of News Ian . Edmondson that it was planning to run a ‘supportive story’ but not that . it would publish the diary. 'Everything to lose': Former News of the World Editor Colin Myler claims he had been told the McCann's press spokesman was aware of the . article . Mr Edmondson, who has since been arrested as part of the phone-hacking inquiry, told Mr Myler the diary was obtained from a Portuguese journalist. Asked why he did not phone Mr McCann to check if permission had been given, Mr Myler said: ‘Because Ian Edmondson had assured me on more than one occasion that Clarence [Mitchell] was aware of what we were intending to do.’ After the diary was printed, Mr Myler ran an apology in the paper ‘because I felt very bad that she didn’t know’, he said. Speaking after yesterday’s hearing, Mr Mitchell said: ‘At no point in the one brief call that I received from Ian Edmondson on the Friday evening before publication did he spell out categorically that they had purchased a version of Kate’s diary that had been leaked by the Portuguese police and that they were planning to publish it in as big a way as they subsequently did.’",Colin Myler claims family's press spokesman had given the go ahead .
"By . Mia De Graaf . At least 59 people have died in Guinea following the outbreak of deadly flesh-eating virus Ebola. The first cases of the haemorrhagic fever were spotted late last month. With no known cure or vaccine, health ministers have warned people to stay inside while they try to stop it spreading. Ebola was first spotted in Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo, where Medicins Sans Frontieres workers pictured are pictured at an isolation unit. They are now stepping up units and work force in Guinea . Symptoms include internal and external bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea. It is spread by personal contact and kills 25-90 per cent of those infected. 'In Guinea, a country with a weak medical infrastructure, an outbreak like this can be devastating,' the Unicef representative in Guinea, Dr. Mohamed Ag Ayoya, said in a statement. Unicef has prepositioned supplies and stepped up communication on the ground to sensitise medical staff and local populations on how to avoid contracting the illness, Agoya added. Analysts suggest this is the first instance of Ebola in Guinea, as it is more commonly found in Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo. Officials have urged people to stay calm, wash their hands and report all cases to authorities. Based on evidence from cases in Uganda (pictured), health ministers have warned people to avoid contact . They have also warned people against eating wild meat, and offered free health care to anybody that detects symptoms. The international medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres announced yesterday it was reinforcing its medical and logistics teams in Guinea in response to the epidemic. It is also flying in 33 tons of medicines and equipment and setting up isolation units in the three affected areas in the country. 'Isolation units are essential to prevent the spread of the disease, which is highly contagious,' Dr. Esther Sterk, MSF tropical medicine advisor, said. 'Specialised staff are providing care to patients showing signs of infection.'","Analysts claim Guinea has never had the disease common in Uganda .

"By . Steve Robson . Kim Jong Un called for the two Koreas to be reunited during a surprise New Year's speech last night. In the first television address by a North Korean leader for 19 years, he said he wanted an end to 'confrontation' between the two countries. But he also promised to boost the country's military power and make the science and technology sector world class. Scroll down for video . Kim John Un gave the first television address to the nation by a North Korean leader for 19 years . In what appeared to be a pre-recorded address for state television, Kim Jong Un said: 'An important issue in putting an end to . the division of the country and achieving its reunification is to . remove confrontation between the north and the south. 'The past records of inter-Korean relations show that confrontation between fellow countrymen leads to nothing but war.' Kim's grandfather, national founder Kim Il Sung, would routinely . address his people on New Year's Day, but his father, Kim Jong . Il, avoided making public speeches. He . never gave a television address during his 17-year-rule, and his New Year's . messages were published as joint editorials in the nation's three major . newspapers. Fireworks exploded over Kim Il Sung Square in celebration of the New Year following the speech. Kim Jong Un outlined plans to improve the impoverished nation's economy through science and technology. 'The . industrial revolution in the new century is, in essence, a scientific . and technological revolution, and breaking through the cutting edge is a . shortcut to the building of an economic giant,' he said. He . then pointed at the success of a long-range rocket that North Korea . fired on December 12 carrying a satellite into space, drawing international condemnation. 'Let . us bring about a radical turn in the building of an economic giant with . the same spirit and mettle as were displayed in conquering space,' he . said. North Korea has tested two atomic devices since 2006, both times weeks after U.N. condemnation of a long-range launch. Fireworks explode over Kim Il Sung Square in celebration of the New Year in Pyongyang, North Korea . A recent analysis of North Korea's main nuclear test site indicates readiness for a possible third atomic explosion. Kim made no mention of nuclear weapons, but indicated that the military will continue to be boosted. 'The sector of defense industry should develop in larger numbers sophisticated military hardware of our own style that can contribute to implementing the Party's military strategy,' he said. 'Only when it builds up its military might in every way can it develop into a thriving country and defend the security and happiness of its people.' The speech came amid scuffles as activists tried to send balloons carrying anti-North Korean propaganda into the country from the demilitarised zone. A men tries to cut a balloon which activists are about to send over the border from South Korea containing anti-North Korean leaflets . The activists begin attacking the man after he managed to cut the balloon to prevent them from sending the information over the border . The scuffles took place outside a former North Korean headquarters in the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea on New Year's day . The group of activists sent millions of propaganda leaflets towards North Korea by balloons urging citizens to rise up against their leader Kim Jong Un . The two Koreas have seen tensions rise to the highest level in decades after the North bombed a Southern island in 2010 killing two civilians and two soldiers. The sinking of a South Korean navy ship earlier that year was blamed on the North but Pyongyang has denied it and accused Seoul of waging a smear campaign against its leadership. Last month, South Korea elected as president Park Geun-hye, a conservative daughter of assassinated military ruler Park Chung-hee whom Kim Il-sung had tried to kill at the height of their Cold War confrontation. Park has vowed to pursue engagement with the North and called for dialogue to build confidence but has demanded that Pyongyang abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions, something it is unlikely to do. Conspicuously absent from Kim's speech was any mention of the nuclear arms program.","Leader calls for end to division between North and South Korea .

"By . Corey Charlton . The Boston Marathon bombing and a rise in terrorist activity has contributed to the U.S. falling outside the world's 100 most peaceful countries, according to new data. The new ranking now leaves the U.S. trailing countries Benin, Haiti and Bangladesh, which are placed 99, 98 and 97 respectively. The nation's slip to place 101 out of 162 nations is revealed in the Global Peace Index  - an annual report which ranks countries according to their 'absence of violence'. A new study shows the U.S. has fallen outside the 100 most peaceful countries partly due to terrorist activity . The Boston Marathon bombings on April 15 last year . caused outrage when three people were killed and 264 injured after two . pressure cooker bombs were exploded during the city race . The report said the attacks on the city by the 'Islamist-inspired terrorists' were the most shocking attacks on U.S. soil since September 11. 1. Iceland - 11892. Denmark - 11933. Austria - 12004. New Zealand - 12365. Switzerland - 12586. Finland - 12977. Canada - 13068. Japan - 13169. Belgium - 135410. Norway - 1371 . 153. North Korea - 3.071154. Pakistan - 3.107155. Democratic Republic of Congo - 3.213156. Central African Republic - 3.331157. Sudan - 3.362158. Somalia - 3.368159. Iraq - 3.377160. South Sudan - 3.397161. Afghanistan - 3.416162. Syria - 3.650 . 'Furthermore, the intelligence and security services have disrupted and prevented a number of plots over the past decade.' As a result, the nation's score for terrorist activity placed it within the bottom quartile of the assessed nations. In the days following the bombing, Chechen brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were identified as suspects and shortly afterwards, a firefight and manhunt ensued before Tamerlan was killed and Dzhokhar arrested. However, the nation's high level of terrorist threats were not the only factor responsible for the fall. The nation's high levels of 'militarisation' also contributed. This . included the population's relative ease of access to small arms, its . massive nuclear and heavy weapons arsenal, and its weaponry export and . imports. Unsurprisingly, . Syria has firmly rooted itself to the bottom of the rankings with large . amounts of displaced people, numerous types of violence, political . instability, criminality, terrorist activity and deaths from conflicts. Meanwhile, . mostly Scandinavian and European countries topped the rankings, with . Iceland, Denmark, Austria, New Zealand and Switzerland leading the way.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Shocking video footage has emerged of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice dragging his seemingly unconscious fiancée Janay Palmer out of an elevator at an Atlantic City casino on Saturday. The video would appear to contradict earlier claims by Rice's attorney that Saturday's incident was just a ‘very minor physical altercation.’ The couple were both arrested soon after on assault charges at the Revel Casino and police say they have separate unreleased footage which proves both parties attacked each other. Scroll down for video . Baltimore Ravens star running back Ray Rice can be seen dragging his unconscious fiancee out of elevator after alleged mutual attack . The video would appear to contradict earlier claims by Rice's attorney that the incident was a 'very minor physical altercation' In the released footage, Rice can be seen trying to lift and move a seemingly unconscious Palmer out of a casino elevator. With Palmer is sprawled on the ground, a security man in a suit - who appears to speak into a microphone at one stage - approaches and confronts Rice. Moments later Palmer seems to regain consciousness and Rice walks away from her. The couple were taken to a nearby police station, charged and then released. Rice's attorney Michael Diamondstein told TMZ Sports that the footage ‘is not the complete event, but is merely the end result of what transpired.’ Rice has been dating Palmer since 2008 and the pair have a daughter, 2-year-old Rayven . 'We'll assure the public that when this matter is fully tried and completed, you'll have a better understanding of what happened and we ask the public to reserve making any judgment until all of the facts come out,' he said. Rice, who doesn’t have a history of off-the-field issues, faces a possible suspension under the NFL’s personal conduct policy.

"By . Chris Pleasance . With modern advertising boards showing video clips, messaging passersby and even interacting with viewers, it is difficult for a classic billboard to stand out. However, one board in Pennsylvania has been attracting attention after displaying odd slogans and messages as part of an art project. Jon Rubin, 50, and fellow academic Pablo Garcia contact an artist each month and ask them to write a message for their billboard, which is then displayed using heavy wooden letters. Jon Rubin, 50, and Pablo Garcia have taken over an old-fashioned billboard in Pennsylvania as an art project. In this post 11-year-old Maude Liotta wonders about what to post on her new blog . Charlie Humphrey used his message in April this year to take a swipe at social media and Facebook users . This message, written by Joshua Beckman, displayed his phone number. If people called him, he would read verse to them, or listen to poems they wanted to read . The notes, which have ranged from witty . remarks to short poems and even two phone numbers, then stay up for a . month before being replaced. One artist wrote the word 'Poem' in front . of his phone number, then read verse to anyone who called or listened . to poems they wanted to read to him. Another artist also displayed his phone number with only a question mark above it, before speaking to people about a topic chosen by them. 'He said the majority of calls were from people who wanted advice,' Jon added. The messages, which are displayed on a metal rack and made using wooden letters, are left for a month before being taken down. This one, by Packard Jennings, was the first to be shown in January last year . Jon says his favourite messages are self-referential, such as this one which offers stubborn viewers the chance to say sorry without having to actually say it . Another artist, Marc Horowitz, also put up his phone number and spoke with callers over the course of the mother it stayed up. He said most of them phoned asking for advice . Other messages have included a swipe at . Facebook, a mad plan to announce births and deaths from a loudspeaker on . hospital roofs, and one note which simply read: 'These words hold no . power over you.' While most of the submissions come by direct invitation from Jon or Pablo, they do occasionally take ideas via email, or directly from the internet. One of the most bizarre came from an 11-year-old girl who wrote: 'Ideas for my new blog: Who invented tape, how were feelings discovered, when did '""skinny"" become fashionable?' The project is called The Last Billboard as a nod to the changing nature . of advertising and text in general. Jon asks artists for messages to display on the boards, as well as collecting notes from around the internet. This post, by Anthony Discenza, appeared last month . In May Adam Frelin displayed this mad plan for loudspeakers on hospital roofs to make public announcements . Forgotten: This downbeat display remembers all of the hours that went into forgotten labours of love . 'Billboards like this take hours to . erect and they stay there for a month,' said Jon who believes ads such . as these will soon become obsolete. He added: 'A month is a long time in today's . world of instant digital messaging.' Jon was educated at California College of Arts and Crafts, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and Ohio State University and has exhibited work across the US and abroad.

"By . Andy Dolan . Doreen Banks joined the club in 1961, after being encouraged by her late husband to take up the sport . In failing health and reliant on a buggy to get around the course, pensioner Doreen Banks thought her best golfing moments were behind her. But more than five decades after taking up the game, the jubilant widow is celebrating her first hole-in-one - at the grand old age of 85. The achievement makes Mrs Banks one of the oldest golfers in the country to score a hole-in-one - and the octogenarian triumphed despite the fact she is slowly going blind. Mrs Banks managed the feat on a 110-yard par three hole at Oxley Park Golf Club in Wolverhampton earlier this month. The pensioner joined the club in 1961 after being encouraged to take up the game by her late husband, Colin, who had become a member the previous year. She aced the course’s tricky sixth hole using a five wood, watched by playing partner Pat Rogers, 71. Mrs Banks said she originally thought she had lost the ball until her friend found it in the hole. She added: ‘Fellow golfers will laugh, but I actually used my five wood because I don’t hit the ball very far these days. ‘But it does go straight so I just gripped down the club shaft and hit it more in hope than judgement. ‘This golf club has been a major part of my life and I now need a buggy to enable me to play at all, but I was more than happy to buy drinks in the bar for all my fellow members when I got back in after my round.’ She managed the feat on the sixth hole of the course, a 110-year par three . Mrs Banks, who lives in Wolverhampton, is a former PE teacher who represented England three times at hockey before switching sports in 1961. She said: ‘By then, I was finding it harder to run around the hockey field, but with golf, of course, there is none of that.’ She said her husband, an engineer, had joined the Oxley Park club in 1960, adding: ‘Colin would leave for a round of golf each Saturday and Sunday morning at 9am and I would expect him home at around 1pm - but it rarely happened. ‘I didn’t know about the 19th hole in those days. In the end I just decided to join him.’ Mr Banks died aged 75 in 2002. The couple had no children. Mrs Banks said he would be ‘very proud’ of her achievement. Mrs Banks played hockey for England before switching sports to golf . The pensioner suffers from peripheral neuropathy, a relatively common condition where the peripheral nervous system - which controls motor and sensory nerves, as well as those which regulate automatic bodily functions such as blood pressure, bladder function and sweat levels. It affects eight per cent of people 55 and over and can cause numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, shooting pains and a loss of co-ordination in the affected body parts. Although Mrs Banks needs a golf buggy to navigate the course and needs glasses to see, she still drives herself to the course and plays a full round most weeks. She is now an honorary member of the club, which she said meant ‘no more fees to pay’, and was Ladies’ captain there in 1973. Mrs Banks was also formerly captain, president and secretary of Staffordshire Ladies County Golf Association, winning the national trophy in 1993. Oxley Park Golf Club manager Neville Thomson said: ‘Doreen is a long standing and revered member of the club and everybody is absolutely thrilled with her achievement. ‘What makes this really special is how long she has been at the one club and how long she has been trying. ‘A lot of golfers will never get a hole in one. There is always a celebration and the tradition is for the player who got it to buy everyone they are playing with a drink.’ The oldest golfer ever recorded to have made a hole-in-one was 102-year-old Elsie McLean on April 5, 2007. She holed out with a driver on the 100-yard fourth hole at Bidwell Park, in Chico, California.","Doreen Banks, 85, joined Oxley Park Golf Club in 1961 .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Scientists have uncovered a bizarre 165 million-year-old fossil with a gigantic sucking plate attached to its body. An international team recently discovered the spectacular fly larva fossil in the freshwater lakes of present-day Inner Mongolia, China. In this habitat, the parasite would crawl onto passing salamanders, attach itself with its sucking plate, and penetrate the thin skin of the amphibians in order to suck blood. Thanks to the fine-grained mudstone, the details of the 0.7in (2cm) long parasite Qiyia jurassica (pictured) are exceptionally preserved. The head was tiny in comparison to the body and was tube-shaped. The mid-body was completely transformed into a sucking plate while its abdomen had caterpillar-like legs . The spectacular fly larva, which has received the scientific name of ‘Qiyia jurassica’, was an unexpected find. ‘Qiyia' in Chinese means 'bizarre'; 'jurassica' refers to the Jurassic period to which the fossils belong. To date no insect is known that has such a huge sucking plate. Scientists believe the parasite, a fly larva around 0.7-inches (2cm) long, had undergone extreme changes over the course of evolution. For instance, the head was tiny in comparison to the body and was tube-shaped with piercer-like mouthparts at the front.

The mid-body was completely transformed underneath into a gigantic sucking plate while its abdomen had caterpillar-like legs. ‘The parasite lived the life of Reilly’, said Professor Jes Rust from the Steinmann Institute for Geology, Mineralogy and Palaeontology of the University of Bonn. This is because there were many salamanders in the lakes, as fossil finds at the same location near Ningcheng in Inner Mongoliaave shown. ‘There scientists had also found around 300,000 diverse and exceptionally preserved fossil insects’, reports scientist Dr Bo Wang, who is researching in palaeontology at the University of Bonn. ‘No insect exists today with a comparable body shape', said Dr Bo Wang. That the bizarre larva from the Jurassic has remained so well-preserved to the present day is partly due to the fine-grained mudstone in which the animals were embedded. 'The finer the sediment, the better the details are reproduced in the fossils', explained Dr Torsten Wappler of the Steinmann-Institut of the University of Bonn. This reconstruction shows how scientists think the fly larvae attached itself to the skin of the salamander. 'No insect exists today with a comparable body shape', said Dr Bo Wang . Astonishingly, no fossil fish are found in the freshwater lakes of this Jurassic epoch in China. 'On the other hand, there are almost unlimited finds of fossilised salamanders, which were found by the thousand', says Dr Bo Wang. This unusual ecology could explain why the bizarre parasites survived in the lakes: fish are predators of fly larvae and usually keep them in check. 'The extreme adaptations in the design of Qiyia jurassica show the extent to which organisms can specialise in the course of evolution', Professor Rust said. A team of German and Chinese researchers recently discovered the spectacular parasite fossil in the freshwater lakes of present-day Inner Mongolia, China . As unpleasant as the parasites were for the salamanders, their deaths were not caused by the fly larvae. 'A parasite only sometimes kills its host when it has achieved its goal, for example, reproduction or feeding ', Dr Wappler explained. If Qiyia jurassica had passed through the larval stage, it would have grown into an adult insect after completing metamorphosis. However, the scientists don't yet have enough information to speculate as to what the adult would have looked like, and how it might have lived.","'Qiyia jurassica' fossil was found in freshwater lakes of Inner Mongolia .

"By . Rob Waugh . When the Greek poet Homer was writing The Odyssey around 2,800 years ago, the Earth went through an abrupt period of cooling, caused by the sun - and the same could happen again soon. Scientists at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences analysed lake sediment in Lake Meerfelder Maar, and found direct evidence of a sudden cooling caused by a 'solar minimum'. Some scientists suspect that the current period of high solar activity - including increased sunspots and solar storms thsi year - will be followed by a 'minimum' period, which could even cause an Ice Age. Scientists at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences analysed lake sediment in Lake Meerfelder Maar, and found direct evidence of a sudden cooling caused by a 'solar minimum' When the Greek poet Homer was writing The Odyssey around 2,800 years ago, the Earth went through an abrupt period of cooling, caused by the sun - and the same could happen again soon . If the GFZ research is correct, a new 'solar minimum' could have a direct impact on Earth's climate - cooling our planet drastically, and knocking the predictions of global-warming alarmists out of whack. Dr Achim Brauer of the GFZ said,'An abrupt cooling in Europe together with an increase in humidity and particularly in windiness coincided with a sustained reduction in solar activity 2800 years ago.' Brauer's measurement's of lake sediments allow 'a precise dating even of short-term climate changes.' The 'Homeric Minimum' - the solar minimum that coincided with the famous poet's lifetime - caused a cool period that lasted 200 years. 'Scientists from the German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ in collaboration with Swedish and Dutch colleagues provide evidence for a direct solar-climate linkage on centennial timescales,' say the researchers. 'Using the most modern methodological approach, they analysed sediments from Lake Meerfelder Maar, a maar lake in the Eifel/Germany, to determine annual variations in climate and solar activity.' Suggestions that the sun might affect climate so profoundly are controversial. Mankind’s use of fossil fuels has led to billions of tons of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere, triggering global temperature rises from which experts believe we will take millennia to recover. That is the consensus view. Three centuries ago similar changes in the Sun were linked to a period of almost unprecedented cold, known as the ‘little ice-age’ - a time when the ice on London’s River Thames was regularly a foot deep and when thousands went hungry because crops froze in the fields. Frost Fair on the Thames at London 1683: His best evidence for this link comes from the last time the Sun went to sleep, the so-called ¿Maunder Minimum¿ period from 1645 to 1715 . The link between Solar ‘moods’ and the weather down here on Earth was first noticed in the 1970s, when the American astronomer Jack Eddy noticed a strong correlation between historic weather records and contemporaneous accounts of Solar activity, most notably the long record of sunspots published a century before by the astronomer Edward Maunder. Eddy noticed that a ‘quiet’ Sun correlates with cold weather and a manic phase means warmer conditions. His best evidence for this link comes from the last time the Sun went to sleep, the so-called ‘Maunder Minimum’ period from 1645 to 1715. During this period and for about a century either side, much of Europe and North America suffered a succession of bitterly cold winters and damp washout summers - the ‘little ice age’.","Lake sediment proves 'solar minimum' caused 200 years of cooling 2,800 years ago .

'The bullet exited her bicep and then struck a 17-year-old male student in the shoulder,' police said. The female student was treated for her injuries and released from Albert Einstein Medical Center, while the male victim was admitted in stable condition, police said. The hospital could not provide additional information Saturday because police had not released the male victim's name. Two students were injured on Friday's shooting, of which Raisheem Rochwell, pictured, is a suspect .

Two Philadelphia Police Department officers stand across the street from the Delaware Valley Charter High School where two students were shot and sustained non-life threatening wounds in a shooting in the schools cafeteria in Philadelphia on January 17 . Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said police didn't know what staffing or security procedures were in place at the school but said ""there was a breakdown in security of some kind"" because the gun got into the building. The school was placed on lockdown and secured by SWAT officers checking each room. Students were searched and released one by one. A spokesman for the school district didn't immediately respond to a call seeking comment. The president of the charter school's board of trustees said he didn't have any additional information about the shooting. Police said the suspects ran away after the shooting, and were identified after police reviewed school surveillance video. Police have yet to recover the weapon. School officials and security officials initially identified a third student, 15, as a possible suspect. 'However investigators concluded that school security officials had provided inaccurate information to police concerning this young man, and he absolutely did not have any involvement in this incident,' police said in one statement Saturday. 'He was released and absolutely cleared by investigators.' The shooting took place here, at Delaware Valley Charter High School .

"By . Associated Press . A camel escaped from an enclosure in a Southern California high desert community Friday, stomped a 72-year-old man who tried to capture it, and chased other people before it calmed down and was corralled. The camel escaped in the unincorporated community of Acton and was reported chasing cars shortly after 8:30 a.m., Los Angeles County sheriff's officials said. The man is currently in hospital and will need stitches for a gash to his head, while the camel is being held by police. Scroll down for video . Violent: This camel may look harmless, but beneath that dopey smile is the rampaging beast that stomped on a man and bit his head . 'My dad... tried to catch it and it must have cornered him or something, and it took off after him, bit him on the head and knocked him down and stomped on him,' Skylar Dossenbach told KCBS-TV. 'He crawled under something and the camel tried to pull him out from under it.' Her father was hospitalized and needed stitches for a gash to his head, she said. His name wasn't immediately released. 'A neighbor came out and saw the commotion and got the camel away from him,' Dossenbach told KABC-TV. Evidence: Police are holding the camel as evidence against the owner, who allegedly does not have a license to keep it . Roaming free: Neighbors say it is not uncommon to see wild exotic animals loose in the area . 'And the camel actually started chasing them, and they had to jump in a car, and the camel was running around after everybody.' Dossenbach said she finally ended up capturing the camel. 'I just put a halter on him, fed him a treat and he calmly walked down to my round pen and I corralled him,' she said. The camel was seized by animal control officials because the owner does not have a permit and because of the injury, agency spokeswoman Betsy Webster said. The owner could be cited for endangering residents, sheriff's officials said. Locked up: The camel was taken by police and animal welfare officers to Lancaster Animal Shelter . Docile: After her father was attacked by the camel, Skylar Dossenbach managed to capture it herself . Dossenbach said the camel and other animals, including a buffalo and an ostrich, previously escaped from the owner's property, which she described as a zoo. There have been as many as five escapes this year, she said. Dossenbach said she believed no one lives on the property but a caretaker comes by daily to feed and water the animals. The camel is now being held as evidence. Neighbors told KTLA that it's not unusual to see exotic animals in the area. One man said an emu got loose last year, and another said he'd seen people riding  camel in the area, though it's unclear if it's the same one.","A camel escaped its enclosure in a California community and attacked a man who tried to corral it .

"By . Lydia Warren . Lorena Bobbitt has revealed that despite famously slicing off her husband's penis two decades ago, she didn't have any trouble dating afterwards. Speaking out 21 years after making international headlines, the 44-year-old has expressed her regret over the attack, while also revealing how she has moved on with her life since. She is now living in Gainesville, Virginia, where she works in real estate, enjoys zumba and raises money for women's shelters. She has an eight-year-old daughter with her partner of 16 years. 'Believe it or not, I had quite a few gentlemen that wanted to date me,' she told NBC4, smiling. Scroll down for video . Revealed: Lorena Bobbitt, 44, is now a mother-of-one and working as a realtor living in Gainesville, Virginia, two decades after she famously sliced off her abusive husband's penis while he was in bed . In 1993, Ecuadorian-born Lorena was 24 and working as a manicurist in Manassas, Virginia while enduring physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her husband John Wayne Bobbitt. On June 23, 1993, he returned from a night of drinking and started to row with his then-wife. Lorena later told authorities that he raped her, but he was acquitted of the alleged attack. After . he fell asleep, she went out to the kitchen and picked up an eight-inch knife before returning to the bedroom and slicing off his . penis. She says the night was 'a blur'. Leaving him bleeding in their bed, she then jumped in the car and drove off, throwing the . severed penis out of the window into a field. Focus: Lorena, who uses her maiden name 'Gallo', has an eight-year-old daughter named Olivia . New loves: After the trial, she fell in love and has been with her partner - Olivia's father (left) - for 16 years . But moments later, she realized the severity of what she had done and alerted 911. A painstaking search uncovered his penis before doctors worked for nine hours to reattach it. This . year marks 20 years since she was found not guilty by reason of . temporary insanity. Jurors agreed an 'irresistible impulse' provoked by . abuse led her to attack her husband. Speaking to NBC4 from her home, she said she felt bad for what she had done. 'It . was done but it was not done on purpose,' she said. 'It's sad because . domestic violence put me and my ex-husband in the hospital.' She . said it took a lot of energy to pull herself away from that life - she . and Bobbitt divorced in 1995 - but that she no longer see herself as a victim. Trial: An emotional Lorena Bobbitt, left, and John Wayne Bobbitt, right, testify in her trial in January 1994 . Attack: Dr. James T. Sehn, one of the surgeons who reattached the penis, holds a blurred photo of it in court . Lorena now uses her maiden name - Gallo - but said she still uses 'Bobbitt' while carrying out charity work for shelters so that people recognize her. 'I use that name, the Lorena Bobbitt . name, to help others,' she said. 'Something good has to come out of this . tragedy like mine.' She and Olivia also deliver Easter baskets and Christmas gifts to families in need, and she proudly says she wants her daughter to realize 'Working together as a team we can help others.' She has a great group of female friends who 'don't judge anybody [and] don't judge me.' After recently googling herself her main complaint was her birthday was wrong. She is 44, proud, and fitter than ever after a recent 20lb weight loss . Moving on: Following the high-profile court case, John Wayne Bobbitt went on to star in porn films . Back on screens: Bobbitt is pictured right on a special 'Where Are They Now?' episode of The View in 2011 . Her . ex-husband found that the surgeons' work to reattach his severed pens . had been a success and he starred in a few porn movies, including 'John . Wayne Bobbitt Uncut'. In . an interview last year, Bobbitt, who also underwent a penis enlargement . paid for by a radio show, claimed he had slept with around 70 women . since the attack. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'Being the most famous man to have his penis chopped off does have its advantages. It definitely has not hurt my love life - in fact it improved it.' But his celebrity lifestyle caught up with him and in 1994 he was jailed for 15 days for assaulting his then-fiance Kristina Elliott. They never married. He went on to marry two other women - a businesswoman in 2001 to whom he was wed for just 23 days, and a woman in 2002, whom he was also accused of assaulting. The marriage ended after two years.

"By . Bianca London . Have you ever wondered what men find sexy? Why some have trouble with commitment? What makes them happy? One astrologer and life coach, who interviewed hundreds of men for her new book, claims she has learned the secrets of their souls and now she's eager to share them with the women of the world. Linda Joyce, who describes herself as 'a one-woman powerhouse for people looking for a pragmatic strategy to solving difficult personal problems,' has just penned The Untold Story, Interviews With Men and thinks she's cracked what makes men happy. Could Made In Chelsea's Binky Felstead use this advice? One life coach believes she holds the answers to why men cheat, why they have trouble with commitment and what makes them happy . Linda, who interviewed hundreds of men - ranging from her local coffee shop assistant to hedgefund owners - about their views on dating and love, said: 'I was curious about how men were dealing with the changing role of women in society and it's safe to say that I am amazed at how traditional men are.' Linda shared certain points she thinks we don't - but ought to - know about men with FEMAIL. Her first piece of advice? 'Just tell men what you want, when you want it. 'Men just want to please us but we are so hard to please. Women just expect a man to know what they're thinking but they won't have a clue.' Linda, who has starred on 20/20 with Barbara Walters, the Howard Stern Show and The Late Show with David Letterman, also believes that men deny, rationalise and lie - all because women don't accept the truth. 'Women live in a fantasy world,' she says. 'Women want men to rescue them but they can't.' Linda believes that while women refuse to give up if they don't get something, men simply shut down. 'Men shut down and we think it's because they don't care but it's actually because they care so much that they just don't want to mess up and disappoint us. Guru? Linda Joyce has penned The Untold Story, Interviews With Men and thinks she's cracked what makes men happy . 'Emotionally, they can't say no and they'd rather not commit to saying anything than let us down. They'd rather a woman think they're an idiot than be honest.' Clearly working with so many men has made Linda sympathise with them - she firmly believes that women contribute and help create these problems for men. 'We want them to be emotional but they just can't be, end of,' she maintains. Linda has also offered her insight into the male psyche and believes the male bravado is all a front. 'Men live fake lives,' she proclaims. 'They pretend to be someone they're not, they've been trained that way and feel the need to be competitive but they always come up short compared to others - that's why men's suicide rates are higher.' Aside from Linda's musings on what makes men tick, she also shared her advice for impressing a man. Rule number one? Don't sleep with him on the first date! 'Men want to work for you, it makes them feel strong. My research shows that while a lot of men won't necessarily judge you for sleeping with them on the first date, there's no way they'll have a long-term relationship with you or take you home to meet their mother. 'Men are blinded by lust, it's their drug. Your evening together could be full of passion and lust and he may tell you you're the greatest girl in the world but I can guarantee he will wake up and find you 50 per cent less attractive in the morning. 'He will wonder if you do that with every man, he wants to feel special and not used,' she explained. Linda also believes that confidence is the sexiest attribute a woman can posses because a man loves a woman that is 'in touch' with herself and 'doesn't need rescuing'. Is that where Binky went wrong with Alex? Linda believes that men cheat because women don't make them feel like a man and then they shut down and act selfishly . 'He doesn't like slutty dresses, nor heels we can't walk in and he absolutely hates desperate women. Oh and by the way, men under 29 only want you for sex.' So you've impressed the guy and followed Linda's rules...so why does he cheat on you? 'They cheat because women don't make him feel like a man and then they shut down. Women try and over feminise their men so they cheat. 'They're not angry at their wives but angry at themselves for letting a woman try and change them,' she said. Linda, who is divorced and describes herself as 'one of the women' she writes about, also believes that men don't even seek happiness in a relationship. 'Men don't value happiness,' she argues. 'They want things to be in order and when there's no problems, they're happy. When they can't handle it, they become selfish and cut themselves off. 'Men are very good at compartmentalisation. They can have their wife and family in one box and their lover in another. Extra-marital sex is a release for men, not a betrayal.' Linda, whose client list includes well-known celebrities and international business titans, is convinced she knows what she's talking about. 'I've saved a lot of lives,' she says. Wise words? Speaking about what men want, Linda says he doesn't like slutty dresses, nor heels we can't walk in and he absolutely hates desperate women . Want to hear more?

"By . Associated Press Reporter . The next generation of rockets has been revealed as SpaceX founder Elon Musk showed off a reusable capsule he says will revolutionize access to space. Musk, who was behind the Tesla electric sports car, showed off his Dragon V2 at the headquarters of his rocket building company near Los Angeles on Thursday. The company has already flown unmanned capsules to the Space Station, but the latest design will be capable of taking up to seven astronauts into low-Earth orbit. Scroll down for video . Space race: Elon Musk unveils his Dragon V2 shuttle which is capable of launching up to seven astronauts into orbit . Future: A guest climbs inside the cone-shaped rocket which is being promoted as a way of making space travel less expensive . As he revealed the cone-shapped Dragon . V2, he explained the manned aircraft could land anywhere on land 'with . the accuracy of a helicopter'. The . technology would enable rapid reloading as well as meaning the . spacecraft could be reused he said, noting that in the past rockets and . space craft return to Earth in a fireball. 'This is extremely important for revolutionizing access to space because as long as we continue to throw away rockets and space crafts, we will never truly have access to space it'll always be incredibly expensive,' Musk said. The white capsule featured a sleek interior with swing-up computer screens at the control station, a two-level seating system to accommodate up to seven astronauts, and windows for them to marvel at Earth's curvature. Since the shuttle fleet retired in 2011, NASA has depended on Russian rockets to transport astronauts to orbit and back, paying nearly $71 million per seat. Countdown: Garrett Reisman of SpaceX stands inside the Dragon V2, which is competing for a NASA contract . High tech: The space shuttle has screens  that can fold away, and windows so the crew can watch the Earth . The space agency said that it wants U.S. companies to fill the void by 2017 and has handed out seed money to spur innovation. SpaceX, which stands for Space Exploration Technologies Corp, has made four cargo runs to the Space Station about 200 miles above Earth. Last month, its Dragon capsule splashed into the Pacific, returning nearly 2 tons of science experiments and old equipment. Companies competing for the right to ferry station astronauts need to design a spacecraft that can seat a crew of four or more, and be equipped with life support systems and an escape hatch in case of emergency. SpaceX has said that it is designing a seven-seat spacecraft. SpaceX and longtime NASA contractor Boeing Co. are 'more or less neck and neck' in the competition, but there's a long way to go before astronauts can rocket out of the atmosphere on private spacecraft, John Logsdon, professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, said. Next generation: SpaceX says the shuttle will provide a less expensive way to connect to the Space Station . Rocket man: Elon Musk and his company are competing for rights to be the carrier of astronauts to the International Space Station . Logsdon said progress by private companies is slower than anticipated mainly because Congress has not fully funded NASA's budget request for the effort. He said it was important for the U.S. to wean its reliance on Russia given the political tension over the annexation of Crimea. 'It's essential to have our own capability to transport people to space,' he said. 'This is an important step in that direction.'","Founder of Tesla electric car sets his sights on space travel with Dragon V2 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The Conservatives have deleted everything the party said before the last election from its website to stop people checking if they have broken promises. A decade of speeches, articles and press releases has been wiped from the archive, with the material also disappearing from search engine results. The attempt to rewrite digital history appears to be at odds with David Cameron’s pro-transparency declaration that political leaders had to ‘let go of the information that we've guarded so jealously’. Wiped: Visitors to the Conservative party website will not be able to find any material which predates the 2010 election . Speeches and press statements dating from the year 2000 to May 2010 have also been removed from the Internet Archive which acts as a public record of the internet. The speech and news archive disappeared at some time after October 5 this year, Computer Weekly magazine reported. A robot blocker was posted on the site which means search engines and the Internet Archive cannot keep a record of what used to be held there. As a result the Internet Archive has removed the entire record of speeches and news captured since 8 May 1999. It includes promises on cutting inheritance, not imposing 'pointless reorganisations' of the NHS and  and he pro-environment message 'vote blue, go green'. For example, users searching for a story on the launch of the 2010 election manifesto after greeted with a message saying: 'The page you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.' Web robots have been used to block search engines from finding archive material including speeches and news articles dating back to 1999 . The revelation is embarrassing because . both Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have highlighted the . importance of being open with data online. In 2006 Mr Cameron told Google’s Zeitgeist conference: ‘You've begun the process of democratising the world's information. ‘Democratising . is the right word to use because by making more information available . to more people, you're giving them more power.’ It is unclear who is responsible for taking the decision to remove the archive at Tory HQ. Labour MP Sheila Gilmore said: 'The . Tories are trying to hide from their own broken promises and failed . policy. Rather than owning up to the mess they’re making of the economy . and fixing it, they are pretending it hasn't happened. 'This . cynical stunt won't fool any family suffering from a cost of living . crisis. With hardworking people over £1,600 a year worse off under him, . it will take more than David Cameron pressing ""delete"" to make people . forget about his broken promises and failure to stand up for anyone . beyond a privileged few.' Openness: Tory leader David Cameron used to boast to Google that access to information gave voters more 'power' The loss of the archive comes as the Tory party gears up for the 2015 general election. Australian trategist Lynton Crosby has been hired full-time in a £500,000 deal to deliver the overall majority to Mr Cameron which eluded him in 2010. A Conservative spokesman said: 'We’re making sure our website keeps the Conservative Party at the forefront of political campaigning. 'These changes allow people to quickly and easily access the most important information we provide – how we are clearing up Labour’s economic mess, taking the difficult decisions and standing up for hardworking people.'","Speeches, articles and press releases disappear from Conservatives.com .

"By . David Kent . In Natal on Tuesday, with just 12 minutes to go between Uruguay and Italy, Luis Suarez appeared to sink his teeth into the should of Giorgio Chiellini. At the time the referee failed to spot the incident, but FIFA have now got involved, stating on their official website that they are set to investigate the 27-year-old's actions. Uruguay and Suarez have until 5pm local time (9pm BST) on Wednesday to provide evidence, and FIFA could ban the forward for up to two years. But what should his punishment be? Here, Sportsmail experts off their opinions on how they think Suarez should be disciplined... Shocking: He appeared to bite Girogio Chiellini's shoulder during Uruguay's win over Italy . Exhibit A: Giorgino Chiellini pulls down his shirt to show teeth marks to the referee . Jeff Powell . Indefinite suspension from all football world-wide and to serve a minimum of six months. Ban only to be lifted after mandatory counselling and an independent psychological evaluation that he is mentally fit to return. Laura WilliamsonLuis Suarez needs a 10-match international ban as an absolute minimum but, more importantly, there must be a rehabilitative element to his punishment. Tuesday night's incident scarred the game, the World Cup and Uruguay, but also Suarez's club, Liverpool, and the Premier League and cannot be allowed to happen again. Bans and fines clearly have little impact, so something else must be done to get through to this brilliantly talented but ultimately flawed footballer.Sami MokbelIt's hard to say how long his ban should be - but it should certainly be a suspension that applies to both international and club football. A suspension for solely international fixtures wouldn't be suffice. If his ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic was 10 games - then his forthcoming punishment should certainly be double that. Painful: Suarez holds his teeth in pain while Chiellini rolls around the floor in agony following the incident . The tooth hurts! Luis Suarez appeared to bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup . Laurie WhitwellIt is clear Suarez should play no further part in this World Cup or any football for a long time.Chomping at another person on three separate occasions shows a mental problem that will only be recognised as such by Suarez if the world governing body show their teeth. A year-long ban wouldn't be too much in my opinion, while a permanent gum shield on his return should be considered. Seriously. I would also question those who have condoned his behaviour. Manager Oscar Tabarez, captain Diego Lugano, and Gaston Ramirez (who tried to cover up Chiellini's bite marks) should face a grilling. Matt Lawton . Six months. Until the turn of the year. Not sure he'll ever take responsibility for anything he does but I'd throw the book at him. Needs to be properly punished. Matt BarlowWhat a shame it will be to see Suarez removed from this thrilling tournament; to take the edge from what promises to be a fabulous last 16 tie between Uruguay and Colombia. But FIFA must deliver a heavy punishment, a ban of 10 international games say. It is akin to assault and he has previous but he has not badly injured anyone. I don't see any reason to ban him from all football. That would not occur with any other type of on-field assault. Controversy: Suarez (top left) is captured biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013 . Previous: Suarez received a seven game ban for biting PSV's Ottman Bakkal while playing for Ajax, 2010 . Riath Al-SamarraiIt's a difficult one, because the disciplinary precedents for this involve the same man. This man. This strange, gifted man. By using what has been ruled before, it needs to be more than 10 games. But how many? Is it worse than kicking a fan (Eric Cantona, nine months)? I don't think it is. Is it worse than Joey Barton's rampage against Manchester City in 2012 (12 matches)? I'd say so. And this is a repeat offender. He clearly needs more effective psychological help than he has so far received. But with it should come a significant action - a six-month ban from competitive football at any level. A Hannibal Lecter mask might also help.   Ian LadymanThe incident should be judged on its merits. The hysteria that has surrounded it is natural but FIFA should follow their own rules and ban him for three games - no more - for violent conduct.Rob DraperWhat will happen? Three or four match FIFA ban. It's a first offence - the other two occasions took place under different jurisdictions so are irrelevant. What should happen? Psychiatric counselling for what I would imagine is a serious condition which seems to manifest itself in stressful situations. And a worldwide 15-match ban to impress on Suarez the seriousness of the situation. VIDEO Suarez hands Liverpool problem .","Suarez set to be disciplined by FIFA for alleged bite on Chiellini .

Economic attaché Ali Asghar Asadi was reportedly shot multiple times to the body as he drove out of the Iranian ambassador's residence in the southern Hadda district of the capital Sanaa. According to one Yemeni police source, the attackers had driven past in a van and opened fire. Economic attaché Ali Asghar Asadi was reportedly shot multiple times to the body as he drove out of the Iranian ambassador's residence (pictured) in the southern Hadda district of the capital Sanaa . However a separate source claimed the gunmen had . first attempted to kidnap the diplomat but when he resisted, they shot him and fled. Yemeni security officials said Asadi died of his injuries hospital. Iranian state television said he had been 'martyred'. Yemen's Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi quickly condemned the attack, describing it as a 'terrorist criminal act' that targeted bilateral relations. Relations between Iran and Yemen have soured over what Sanaa calls Iranian meddling in its domestic affairs. Al-Qirbi said the two countries want to avoid any attempts to harm relations. 'This operation has targeted the . Yemeni-Iranian relations before it targeted the diplomat,' he told the . state news agency SANA. He said authorities will purse the culprits and . bring them to justice. An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman . said: 'The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemns this incident and . will follow up on the case with the Yemeni authorities'. Another Iranian diplomat in Yemen was abducted by gunmen in July and remains in captivity. Officials suspect al-Qaida militants to be behind that kidnapping. Negotiations to secure his release have so far failed. Yemeni soldiers check vehicles in Sanaa last week after suspected al-Qaida militants attacked a military camp in central Yemen.

Al-Qaida's Yemen branch is the world's most active, using political turmoil in the impoverished Gulf country to strengthen its presence there. The government has been battling the militant groups, with assistance from the U.S., which has killed a number of suspected members in drone strikes. Targeted killings of security officials have been on the rise in Yemen. A security official said an intelligence officer was shot dead by unknown assailants Thursday in a drive-by shooting in the southern province of Lahj. Iran's diplomats also have been targeted elsewhere in the region. In November, suicide bombers targeted the Iranian Embassy in Beirut, killing at least 23 people. Shiite-powerhouse Iran is the chief patron of Lebanon's Hezbollah and an ally of Syria's embattled President Bashar Assad. In Yemen, the government and neighboring Saudi Arabia accuse Tehran of supporting Shiite rebels in the north, seeking to destabilize the country. Iran has dismissed the accusations.","Economic attaché Ali Asadi was reportedly shot multiple times to the body .

"By . Mark Duell . A leading British super-yacht brokerage has sold five top-of-the-range boats in as many weeks - with a combined asking price of £32million, it was revealed today. The lavish boats sold by London-based Edmiston include spas, gyms and leather suites on board - and have been snapped up by two Britons, one American and a German. While the Middle Eastern elite were the main buyers of luxury yachts during the recession, brokers have been boosted by a return to business from the super-rich in Europe and the US. Luxury: The refurbished £8million QM of London, which can fit up to 14 guests, is one of five boats that has been sold in the same number of weeks by British super-yacht brokerage Edmiston . Meanwhile a 15 per cent rise in trade has been claimed by luxury charters, reported The Times. Edmiston chairman Nicholas Edmiston said: ‘It’s very encouraging to see buyers re-emerge from the likes of the UK, US and Germany, which used to be the strongest markets before the downturn.’ The boats include the refurbished £8million vessels Sea Dweller, which can house up to 12 guests, and the QM of London, which can fit up to 14 guests - and comes with a water slide and jetpack. Also sold were the £7.9million Nada which can cater for 20 guests, the £7million William Tai and the £1.7million Keewaydin, which features two mahogany guest staterooms and new teak decks. Refurbished: The £7million William Tai (seen in Dartmouth, Devon) was recently refitted and has also been sold .

The news comes two months after Formula One mogul Eddie Jordan was given the keys to his new 155ft super-yacht, which came complete with a nightclub, full-length bar and even a hot tub. Larger than the average family home, the £32million four-deck Sunseeker 155 yacht includes five bedrooms and took 18 months to build, while the boat also has space for 11 members of staff. Other British celebrities including racing driver Lewis Hamilton and retail mogul Sir Philip Green are known to enjoy yachts - with the latter said to own the 212ft Silver Angel, according to The Times. The biggest super-yacht on water is the 590ft Azzam, owned by United Arab Emirates president Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan - 57ft longer than Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich's Eclipse.

"By . Rob Preece . Two dolphins who died a slow, agonising death at a zoo after it hosted a rave were probably killed by a party-goer's heroin substitute, according to a leaked toxicology report. The dolphins, called Shadow and Chelmers, died within five days of each other at a zoo in Switzerland last November. Bosses at the park had rented land near the dolphins' training pool to organisers of a weekend rave party for thousands of clubbers. Slow and painful death: A toxicology report concluded that Shadow was probably killed by a party-goer's heroin substitute . Before the party: Shadow had been one of the star attractions at the Connyland zoo in Switzerland . Prosecutors said at the time that they were considering negligence charges because they believed antibiotics given by zoo vets were to blame for the deaths at Connyland in Lipperswil. But another toxicology report carried out at the time, leaked to Swiss media, has raised new questions about what happened. Tests conducted by the forensics institute in St Gallen found the heroin substitute Buprenorphin in the animals' urine. Dutch marine biologist and dolphin expert Cornelis van Elk said: 'Opiates are extremely dangerous for underwater mammals and would never be used in any legitimate treatment. 'The reason is that dolphins are conscious breathers which means they actively decide when to come to the surface to breathe, for which they need to be awake. 'Even when sleeping, there is part of the brain that automatically controls the breathing instinct in the same way as it does for people when asleep. 'Drugging them with opiates could well cause this part of the brain to switch off with fatal consequences.' Putting on a show: Bosses at the park had rented land near the dolphins' training pool to organisers of a weekend rave party for thousands of clubbers . It was originally suggested by keepers that rave-goers could have caused the death by feeding the dolphins illegal recreational drugs but prosecutors had rejected this, blaming the zoo's vets. Connyland spokesman Erich Brandenberger said it would ask questions about why the initial theory had not been followed up and why the zoo's vets had been blamed. Shadow and Chelmers died after what staff described as a 'drawn out and painful' death. Connyland keeper Nadja Gasser told local media: 'The death went on for over an hour. 'It was horrendous. I have not been able to sleep since. 'When we went to start the dolphin training we noticed the same thing that had happened to Shadow was happening with Chelmers. Investigation: Prosecutors initially considered negligence charges because they believed antibiotics given by the zoo's vets were to blame for the deaths . 'He was drifting under the water and was clearly in trouble and so we jumped into the water. 'We tried to hold him. He was shaking all over and was foaming at the mouth. 'Eventually we got him out of the water. His tongue was hanging out. He could hardly breathe. 'He was given adrenalin, but it didn't help. 'After an hour the dolphin died.' Questions: Bosses at Connyland want to know why the zoo's vets were blamed for the deaths of Shadow and Chelmers . Furious animal activists say they warned both the marine park and local planners - who gave permission for the rave - of the dangers before the event. They had been concerned that the high levels of noise could damage the marine mammals' immune system, sensitive sonar and hearing. Connyland has consistently denied any wrongdoing.","Shadow and Chelmers died within five days of each other at Connyland in Switzerland .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The tobacco hornworm eats tobacco leaves containing doses of nicotine deadly to humans, smokes the toxin to ward off spiders . A caterpillar that eats tobacco leaves containing lethal doses of nicotine 'smokes' the toxin to ward off predators. Until now scientists were unsure of how the tobacco hornworm processed the addictive substance to use as a weapon against hungry spiders. They have discovered that some of the toxin enters the insect’s blood while the remainder is excreted through tiny respiratory holes on its skin and in turn works as an effective deterrent. Ian Baldwin, a molecular ecologist at the Max-Planck-Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, told iO9 that the tobacco hornworm can handle nicotine better than any other animal on the planet and ingests six times the lethal dosage of nicotine for humans every day. To find out why the creature can process nicotine so expertly, Professor Baldwin and his team modified some coyote tobacco plants by stopping their nicotine production and planted them in a test filed in Utah. They then monitored the overnight survival rates of caterpillars eating the modified plants, compared to those munching the regular tobacco plants. They discovered that the creatures eating the nicotine-free diet were more likely to die from being attacked by wolf spiders, which live in the area. The scientists tested the spiders’ feeding habits in the lab and found that they did not like eating nicotine, suggesting that the caterpillar uses the toxin to survive. The tobacco hornworm caterpillar can handle nicotine better than any other animal on the planet and ingests six times the lethal dosage of nicotine for humans every day . The large green caterpillar has a distinctive horn on its bottom segment, which gives it its name. It can grow up to 80 mm long and can quickly strip leaves from tomato and tobacco plants. Known as a garden pest, the tobacco hornworm is commonly found in the U.S. as far north as New York and as far south as Argentina. Predators of the caterpillar include: polistes wasps, big-eyed bugs and lace wings as well as wolf spiders. The caterpillar is used by scientists to look at neurobiology, flight mechanics and larval nicotine resistance . In the lab the caterpillars are blue because the artificial wheat germ diet they are fed does not contain the yellow pigments that normally combine with proteins to turn their bodies green. A previous study uncovered that a gene, CYP6B46, expressed in the caterpillar’s midgut, is not as active in the caterpillars that were fed plants with less nicotine. After creating plants able to silence the CYP6B46 gene, they found the caterpillars that ate them became more attractive to spiders. They worked out that the gene takes around 0.65 per cent of the nicotine from the midgut and transports it into the animal’s blood, but most of it is excreted. The researchers believe the caterpillars puffs out the nicotine through tiny respiratory holes called spiracles that they breathe through and the nicotine tells the spider the caterpillar is deadly. The scientists tested wold spiders' feeding habits in the lab and found that they do not like eating nicotine, suggesting that caterpillar uses the toxin to survive attacks from the arachnids (pictured) To test their theory, they stuck tiny ‘nicotine trapping devices’ onto the spiracles and took them off after a spider caught the modified caterpillar. The devices proved that the caterpillar had been emitting puffs of nicotine when it was under attack. ‘Normally, it would work as a type of toxic halitosis, or bad breath,’ Professor Baldwin said. However, while bad breath works as a deterrent against wolf spiders, it does not protect the caterpillars from all predators – especially not from Geocoris pallens (known commonly as big-eyed bugs), another major predator in the habitat. The researchers think this could be because while the Geocoris pallens only suck the insect’s blood, spiders eat the creature’s gut, which is packed full of nicotine. The researchers found that the caterpillar puffs out the nicotine through tiny respiratory holes that they breathe through, called spiracles and the nicotine tells the spider the caterpillar is deadly .","Each day the tobacco hornworm caterpillar ingests six times the lethal dosage of nicotine for humans .

"By . Andy Dolan . A boy of four choked to death in hospital after his nurse went on a two-hour break. Daniel Hames had acute gastroenteritis but hospital staff were not fully aware of his medical history, an inquest heard. His mother, Christina Smith, told how she had fallen asleep in a chair beside his bed and woke to find a nurse standing over him. Tragic: Daniel Hames died at Doncaster Royal Infirmary after falling ill with gastroenteritis . Parents: Daniel's mother Christina and father Daniel have paid tribute to the four-year-old schoolboy . ‘I jumped up and I just saw my son . lying there,’ she said. ‘He was on his back, not moving. I said to him, . “Don’t leave me, don’t leave me”.’ But Daniel was already dead. The . staff nurse who had been monitoring him at Doncaster Royal Infirmary had . gone on a break after telling a second nurse to carry out observations . on the child. But the inquest heard the observations were not done and Daniel was later discovered to have vomited and choked to death. Assistant coroner John Sleightholme asked a hospital matron if the length of the break was normal. She . said: ‘You anticipate a degree of flexibility but the length of time on . that occasion was not acceptable nor, I am aware, common practice.’ The . nurse who went on the two-hour break was later sacked after a . disciplinary hearing. The inquest heard that Daniel had been admitted the previous day, in March last year, after he began vomiting. A doctor advised his family to take him home and care for him there, making sure he drank liquids after he stopped being sick. Hospital: A nurse at Doncaster Royal Infirmary took a two-hour break when she was supposed to watch him . Hours . later, however, he had to be taken back to hospital by ambulance and . admitted to A&E, before being moved to a paediatric ward. The . inquest heard he had been ill several times with the same condition the . year before, spending four days in hospital, and had been sent home from . school with diarrhoea in February 2013. But . staff in the children’s ward did not have access to a system available . in A&E which brought up a snapshot of the patient’s medical history, . while the paramedic’s notes about Daniel, who was from Doncaster, were . not taken to the ward, as they should have been. At about 7am a doctor was called to Daniel’s cubicle after he was discovered to have vomited. Family: Daniel's mother, grandfather, uncle, father and aunt outside his inquest in Doncaster . Despite the best efforts of the medical staff, he was pronounced dead at 7.39am, less than seven hours after being admitted. Mr . Sleightholme said ‘communications in some way could have done better’ but ruled the death was due to natural causes – acute aspiration of . stomach contents due to adenoviral gastroenteritis. The . hearing, at Doncaster Coroner’s Court, was told that since the tragedy . Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust had carried out a . full investigation and brought in a number of changes.

"By . Ted Thornhill . The traditional dimpled glass pint tankard is usually associated with old men wearing flat caps – but the chunky-handled beer jug is now proving a big pull among pub-going hipsters. In the early 2000s it seemed that the handled pint jug – which first appeared in pubs in the late 1920s - was on the road to extinction. The last British factory to make the handled beer jug, Ravenhead Glass in St Helens, closed down in 2001, pub landlords found straight pint glasses easy to stack in dishwashers – and beer drinkers preferred them, too. But a beer jug revival is now underway thanks to trendy drinkers and city hotspots embracing them – and Al Murray the Pub Landlord toasting his audiences with them. Cheers! Al Murray the Pub Landlord with a traditional dimpled pint jug . The Shacklewell Arms in Dalston, east London, a popular haunt with hipster-types, has been serving dimpled jugs for the past six months. It offers straight glasses, too, but it’s the jugs that the customers prefer. General Manager Rose Dennen told MailOnline: 'The new love of dimpled pint glasses is part and parcel of the revival of the traditional idea of living. People are more aware of what they're putting in their bodies. It's all about being kind to yourself and being aware of your heritage and part and parcel of that is a return to craft beer. 'People aren't drinking less, but drinking better quality products.' Dimpled mugs have been served in Leeds’ North Bar since 2000, with director Christian Townsley revealing that his mainly artistic clientele love the ‘old-school coolness’ of a dimpled tankard, according to the BBC. Pint jug revival: The Shacklewell Arms in east London has seen its hipster clientele embrace handled pint pots . Cask in hand: Shacklewell Arms hipster Dan Woodall enjoys a beer in a handled pint jug . Keeping a handle on things: Shacklewell Arms General Manager Rose Dennen . Top choice: Straight pint glasses are the most popular type with drinkers, but hipsters are embracing dimpled tankards . Traditional designs: The 10-sided beer jug arrived in 1928, left, while the dimpled handled pint pot, pictured right, arrived in 1948 . Evolution: Straight glasses were very popular in the early 20th century and then in the 1960s, but their rims would often nick when they touched, so the nonic glass, right, was brought in to stop this happening . Pint glasses were straight from the beginning of the 20th century up until around 1928, when the 10-sided handled glass pint mug appeared in pubs. In 1948 the dimpled pint jug design arrived, which proved more popular than its 10-sided cousin. According to beer blogger Martyn Cornell, this new trend coincided with lighter coloured beers being embraced. He said: 'The arrival of the dimple coincided with the triumph of bitter over (dark) mild, and amber beers look better in dimpled glasses than in straight-sides ones: the light shining through a pint of bitter in a dimpled glass is the beery equivalent of the windows of Salisbury or Chartres.' Straight pint glasses became all the rage in the 1960s, but their rims easily chipped when they touched, so the 'nonik' - or 'no nick' - glass was invented, which has a bulge in the middle. This meant the glasses touched at a sturdier point and so didn't have to be replaced so often. Lofty, narrow glasses are in vogue these days - often emblazoned with the logo of a beer brand. Source: Martyn Cornell's Zythophile - Beer now and then . He added: ‘They are solid and reassuringly comforting.’ Neil Walker, spokesperson for the . Campaign For Real Ale, said that some pubs use traditional pint pots to . help drinkers distinguish between brands. He told MailOnline: ‘It's fantastic to see dimpled pint glasses making something of a comeback as real ale continues to grow in popularity, particularly in venues which might not have previously served cask beer. ‘Britain is in the middle of a real ale revolution. With well over a thousand breweries now producing real ale, your local pub is now much more likely to be serving a locally produced brew. 'Many pubs which are expanding their beer range are using these traditional pint pots to differentiate their cask beers from mainstream lager brands, something which can only be good for British beer drinkers.’ The Pub Landlord, meanwhile, is also toasting the dimpled pint jug's return. He said: 'The return of these glasses is a triumph. Each one looks like a precious cut diamond but contains something better than 24 carats: one pint. For the first time in my life I salute the young and trendy. Though they should all bloody shave.' Recent research shows that craft beer isn't just proving evermore popular in trendy pubs, but is catching wine as the drink of choice to take to dinner parties. Over half of Brits say they already prefer to take beer, not wine to dinner parties, or plan to make the switch soon, according to a new nationwide poll, by online marketplace EeBria. The site found that the trend is most pronounced among under 35s, who are 20 per cent more likely to drink craft beer over wine at social occasions than older generations. A number of factors are driving the shift in attitudes, the research showed, with 60 per cent of respondents saying they see craft beers as the ideal way to explore new exciting flavours with friends and almost half believe craft beer sparks more interesting conversation than wine. The . handled pint pot so loved by craft beer drinkers first appeared in British pubs in 1928 and had a . 10-sided design. The dimpled design first appeared in 1948, according to . beer blogger Martyn Cornell. He . said: ‘The arrival of the dimple coincided with the triumph of bitter . over (dark) mild, and amber beers look better in dimpled glasses than in . straight-sides ones.’ British . pubs buy their dimpled glassware from factories based oversea, with a . jug costing around three times the price of a straight pint glass.","In the early 2000s it looked like the dimpled pint jug would become extinct .
The last British factory that made them, in St Helens, shut down in 2001 .
Now they're making a comeback thanks to hipsters embracing the design ."
"By . Sarah Griffiths . ‘Disco clams’ were recently caught on camera 'partying' on the ocean floor while producing their own strobe light effects. And now one scientist, who first came across the entertaining mollusc four years ago, has discovered the secret of how it lights up. Ctenoides ales, dubbed disco clams because of this unique feature, produce the effect using its lips - which is packed with tiny spheres of reflective silica - like a mirror ball. Scroll down for video . Underwater raver: The disco clam - Ctenoides ales (pictured) - continually flashes light along the lip margins of its mantle - but no-one is sure why . The strobe-light effect is produced when the clam rolls the edge of its mantle to expose a row of reflective cells. When . the clams are in a bright area of the ocean these cells reflect the . light, making it look like it’s coming directly from the clam. The clams mainly reflect blue light, which can be seen further away in the ocean than other light wavelengths. Lindsey Dougherty encountered the two-inch clam in 2010 while diving with her mother and sister in Wakatobi, Indonesia. She saw Ctenoides ales roll the edge of its mantle - a layer of muscle and tissue that acts like a cloak over the mollusc's body - and produce a strobe-light effect using its mirrored lips. Dougherty, a dive instructor and graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, said: ‘I've dived with humpback whales and great white sharks. ‘But when I saw the disco clam, I was enamoured. I said then, “I'm going to do a PhD on the disco clam.”’ Ctenoides ales are found in tropical areas of the Pacific Ocean, living in crevices in reefs, typically in clusters of two or more. Light is dim and blue-green at the clams' typical depth, which ranges from 10-150 feet  (3 to 50m) but their rippling mirrored lips are visible even without artificial illumination. Lips like a disco ball: Scientist and driving instructor Lindsey Dougherty discovered that the mirrored lips are composed of packed nanospheres ideal for reflecting the blue light prevalent underwater. But she is not sure why the 'disco clams' (pictured) produce the light show . It didn't take long for the scientist to confirm that the flashing was not a form of bioluminescence, which is a chemical reaction inside animals like plankton that produces light similar to that of a glow stick. Instead, she found, the edge of the clam's mantle lip is highly reflective on one side. When the clam unfurls its lip - typically twice a second - the millimetre-wide mirror is revealed and reflects the ambient light, like a disco ball. The inside of the clam's lip is packed with tiny spheres of silica, only 340 nanometers in diameter, that are ideal reflectors, particularly of the blue light that penetrates deeper into seawater compared to red light. The outside of the lip contains no silica nanospheres, so when the lip is furled, no light is reflected, according to the study, published in the British Journal of the Royal Society Interface. By repeatedly unfurling and furling the lip, the clam produces a continual rippling light show. The non-reflective back of the lip strongly absorbs blue light, so it appears dark and makes the contrast between the sides even more striking. A flashy 'dancer': It didn't take long for the scientist to confirm that the flashing (pictured) was not a form of bioluminescence - a chemical reaction inside animals like plankton that produces light similar to that of a glow stick. Instead, she found, the edge of the clam's mantle lip is highly reflective on one side . Ms Dougherty used high speed video, transmission electron microscopy, X-rays and computer modelling to study the detailed internal structure of the margin of the clam's lip, with help from other experts at Berkeley, Duke University and the University of Queensland. She thinks that the ‘disco clam’ is alone in using silica nanospheres as flashing reflectors, but the white colour of several insects comes from a layer of silica that reflects white light. While Ms Dougherty has revealed the mechanics of the mollusc’s mirrored lips, she does not know why it flashes at all. It is unlikely that it uses the light show to attract food as the clams are filter feeders, which means that they eat by straining matter and food particles from the ocean water through an internal filter. Ms Dougherty also thinks it is unlikely that the display is designed to ward off predators, because there is nothing toxic or dangerous about the light. There is a possibility that the disco lights are designed to entice a suitable mate. Scientists are now studying all 40 of the clams’ eyes, in order to see whether they can see their own light display.","Ctenoides ales, or 'disco clam' produces a strobe-light effect using its lips .

"By . Sam Webb . Keeper of culinary secrets: Nigel Brazier at the The Cook Shop with his cooked faggots - one of the recipes he will sell along with the store . For 125 years The Cook Shop has sold traditional cuisine to food-lovers in the small West Midlands town of Cradley Heath. Much-loved traditional Black Country fare such as faggots, Groaty Dick and bread pudding - prepared using closely-guarded family recipes - have been sold there since 1889. Now the owner has put the store on the market for £120,000 - complete with the secret recipes that have been passed down through four generations of his family. Nigel Brazier, 64, is now selling up because he wants to retire and is including the answer to his family’s culinary mysteries in the asking price. The grandfather-of-three is the fourth member of this family to run the deli since his great grandmother Eve Billingham founded the business from her front room during the 19th century. Today Mr Brazier, who has worked at the shop for 49 years, said: 'We are an old-fashioned shop the likes of which hardly exist anymore. 'The business has been going 125 years but my sons have taken their own careers and are doing very well so are not really in a position to take it over. 'There are half a dozen recipes which have been handed down the generations. No-one else has been able to recreate them the same as us. 'They include our pastry recipe, and meats that have no preservatives, and our sage and onion stuffing. 'But the holy grail is the faggots we produce - a lot of butchers make faggots, but not like these.' The shop specialises in selling traditional Black Country favourites such as chitlins - a variation on intestines - as well as black pudding and meat and potato pie. Mr Brazier wants any prospective buyer to ensure the 125-year-old name will not disappear and keep the business up and running with their seven members of staff. The grandfather-of-three is the fourth member of this family to run the deli. Right, a picture of the Old Hill Trinity Church Sunday school in front of The Cook Shop, taken in the 1950s . The family have built a famous reputation within the town but had always vowed to keep their recipes for their signature dishes a secret. But he has promised to throw in half a dozen of them so the new owner can continue to make the perfect faggots and bread pudding. Mr Brazier, who is retiring to spend more time at his home in nearby Clent, Worcestershire, with his librarian wife Anne, 62, added: 'Initially we didn’t have much interest but now there are people beginning to have a think. Eve Billingham (Mr Brazier's great grandmother) in 1900 with her son Arthur. Right, a photo of Mary Priest, Mr Brazier's grandmother and Eve Billingham's oldest daughter, taken in 1910 .

'Instead of me leaving and closing the door, I want to leave it running in the hands of someone who is prepared to take it on. 'They must be keep the name and keep the secret recipes. It’s been an extremely emotional rollercoaster ride - it’s not a decision I came to easily. 'When it eventually came to doing it, I had to think long and hard. My sons wanted me to retire last year but I couldn’t because of our customer base. 'They are all our friends, 300 to 400 customers that we know on a personal basis. We share their lives, we listen to them, laugh and joke with them.' Manageress Linda Wilker preparing food for sale in the kitchen . Traditional fare: Fresh meats, baked goods and other foods on sale at the 125-year-old store . The much-loved shop owner started working there as a 16-year-old boy. It was originally passed from his great-gran Eve Billingham to her daughter Mary Priest and was then ran by Mr Brazier's mother Iris alongside his father Bill. But because his four sons have all carved out careers of their own around the UK, this is the first time the family business is up for sale in 125 years. He sells his famous faggots - which are usually made from pig offal and parts of the animal usually discarded, such as the heart and liver - for just 50p. FAGGOTS . Traditionally faggots are made from offal, usually pork, and from animal parts that are usually discarded, such as the heart and liver. They are a cheap and nutritious dish and have enjoyed somewhat of a resurgence after falling out of favour for many years. The West Midlands and parts of Wales are considered the home of faggots in Britain, but they are now eaten all over the UK. They are often served with peas, onion gravy and chips. GROATY DICK . A beef and onion (or leek) stew thickened with oats. In the Black Country it is traditionally eaten on Bonfire Night. CHITLINS . Chitlins are usually the small intestines of a pig, although the intestines of cattle and other animals are often called Chitlins too. Writer Thomas Hardy mentioned chitterlings in his novel Tess of the D'Urbervilles.BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING . A popular and refreshingly unpretentious pudding, popular throughout the UK, is made by layering slices of buttered bread scattered with raisins in an oven dish and then pouring over an egg and milk (or cream) mixture. It is commonly seasoned with nutmeg and sometimes vanilla. The secret dishes take pride of place behind the counter alongside the sausages and bacon, homemade pies and pastries, bread, cakes and tinned food. Mr Brazier added: 'Lots of butchers make the mistake of throwing any cuts of meat in when making faggots, but there’s a real art to the perfect faggot. 'My mother Iris is 93 and still runs a critical eye over the faggots I produce. They are the finest you can find, we guarantee that. 'So prospective buyers will be getting much more than just a food shop.'","The Cook Shop has served traditional Black Country fare since 1889 .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A Massachusetts teenager accused of killing his math teacher with a box cutter appeared to be 'psychotic' after he allegedly attacked a youth female clinician in Boston earlier this month. According to the petition to have Philip Chism committed to Worcester Recovery Center and Hospital for 30 days of evaluation and treatment, the 15-year-old was 'out of touch with reality' and 'yelling, screaming incoherently [and] foaming at the mouth while being restrained by staff.' The attack happened June 2 at a Department of Youth Services detention center. Scroll down for video . Danger to others: Prosecutors have requested tighter security for Philip Chism, 15 (pictured in January), after he allegedly escaped carers and tried to choke a youth worker . The details were released Tuesday by a Superior Court judge in response to a motion by The Salem News. Chism . pleaded not guilty to robbing, raping and killing 24-year-old Danvers . High School teacher Colleen Ritzer after following her into a restroom . last October. He was 14 at the time. Essex County prosecutors said 15-year-old Philip Chism slipped away from caregivers before the June 2 incident. Prosecutor . Kate MacDougall said Chism crept along a common hallway 'crouched down . out of view,' followed the woman to a locker room and tried to choke her . while holding a pencil. Other workers came to the woman's aid when she . screamed. In the petition to have Chism committed, psychologist Kenneth Rogers wrote that the teenager strangled, punched and stabbed the female unit clinician. 'Once pulled off her, he was out of touch with reality, screaming, yelling and moaning incoherently for about two hours even as he was taken away,' wrote Rogers. The document also stated that Chism's mother informed officials that before the June 2 attack her son had no history of psychosis. Alleged assault: Chism attacked a youth worker at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Boston, say prosecutors . During a hearing held June 10, the . prosecutor insisted that Chism not be left alone with female staff at . the facility, describing the teen as 'someone who appeared utterly calm . and fine in the moments leading up to the event.' Kate . MacDougall also expressed concern that within the detention center, . patients are free to move around, which could potentially put female . staff and patients at risk . Lester Blumberg, the Department of Mental Health attorney who represented the hospital at the hearing, assured the prosecutor that while the patients' rooms are not locked, Chism remains under guard at night and is rarely alone. Missed: Math teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, was raped and murdered with a box cutter last October . Authorities . still don't know what motivated the transfer student . from Clarksville, Tenneessee to kill his teacher. He has pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery and murder in the death of Ritzer, whose body was found in the woods near Danvers High School in October. Her throat was slit and a note reading, 'I hate you all' was found at the scene. Chism, . who had been asked to stay late by Ritzer to help after school, . allegedly followed her into a bathroom on October 22 and attacked her, . sexually assaulted her twice, including once with a stick, stripped her and then stole her cellphone, . credit cars and her driver's licenses. According . to investigators, her body was then placed in a recycling bin and . carted away to a wooded area behind the school and dumped. After . dumping her body, prosecutors say Chism returned to school barefoot . where he changed into his soccer clothes and threw away his bloodied . school clothes. He then went to eat a burger at Wendy's and caught a screening of Woody Allen film 'Blue Jasmine'. Police . arrested him later that evening when he was found walking down a busy . highway. He had a bloody box-cutter in his pocket along with Ritzer's . underwear. Last . month, Ritzer's parents, Tom and Peggie Ritzer, issued a video statement . speaking about their loss while also thanking the community for their . support. 'These . past six months have been a period of great pain and sorrow for our . family and all those who knew and loved Colleen,' mother Peggie said. 'Each . day presents new challenges but we are blessed by the support of family . and friends. Through the many acts of genuine kindness to honor our . daughter and sister, our spirits are lifted. Though difficult, we strive . to follow Colleen's words to find good in every day.' Mental health: Chism's mental state is being evaluated at the Worcester State Hospital . Crime scene: Colleen Ritzer's body was found in a wooded area near Danvers High School following the brutal killing . Heartbroken: In a video shared last month, . Ritzer's family spoke about their loss while thanking the community for . support. Pictured is Ritzer's sister Laura, father Tom, mother Peggie and brother Tom . In the video, Mr Ritzer thanked everyone for turning out to raise money in Colleen's name.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Imagine every time a plane completed a flight, the entire aircraft was scrapped and another built for the next journey. That's the problem facing modern space travel. Each time a rocket is launched almost the entire structure is thrown away, often at the cost of hundreds of millions of pounds. California-based SpaceX are hoping to change this with its Falcon 9 Reusable (F9R) rocket, which is seen taking off and landing in the same spot in this video. Scroll down for video . Above can be seen the landing of SpaceX's Falcon 9 Reusable rocket. The rocket 'hopped' to a height of 3,280ft (1km) before beginning its descent. It is the first time SpaceX has used stabilising 'grid fins' - the mesh-like struts at the bottom-  to stabilise the descent of the rocket . In the clip, released yesterday by SpaceX, the firm performs a test flight of its reusable rocket at its development facility in McGregor, Texas. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wants to help establish a colony of up to . 80,000 people on the planet, but admitted he’d like to start small, . with a group of 10 people, and build the colony from there. He ultimately plans to use a reusable . rocket, fuelled by liquid oxygen and methane, to reach the red planet by 2026. It would need to be much heavier than . SpaceX’s current rockets, including the Falcon Heavy that is currently . in development and is expected to launch by the end of this year. 'I'm hopeful that the first people could be taken to Mars in 10 to 12 years, I think it's certainly possible for that to occur,' he told CNBC. 'But the thing that matters long term is to have a self-sustaining city on Mars, to make life multi-planetary.' However, he is taking no unnecessary risks. He famously once said: 'I'd like to die on Mars, just not on impact.' The rocket flies to 3,280ft (1km), remaining stable the entire time, before coming back to land on the ground. The test follows the successful completion of the Grasshopper program last year, which saw SpaceX gradually increase the ceiling to which its reusable rockets jump. While for now the technology is only capable of these brief hops, it will eventually be used on fully-fledged launches. This will enable SpaceX to launch satellites into orbit and then bring most of the rocket that launched them there back to Earth. This would be a level of reusablility not seen since the Space Shuttle, when Nasa used to recover the two side boosters called Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) from the ocean - in addition to the shuttle orbiters themselves being reusable. But SpaceX’s plan would land the rocket straight back on the pad it took off from and it could be ready for another launch very rapidly. The Falcon 9 Reusable rocket is shown during take off. The test follows the successful completion of the Grasshopper program last year. While for now the technology is only capable of these brief hops, it will eventually be used on fully-fledged launches . In the latest experiments, SpaceX tested a set of steerable fins for the first time, called grid fins. These are seen as the mesh-like fins towards the bottom of the rocket in the video. Falcon . 9 topped with SpaceX fairing is 224.4 feet (68.4 meters) tall and 12 . feet in diameter (the fairing is 17 feet in diameter). Its . nine first-stage Merlin engines generate 1.3 million pounds of thrust . at sea level, rising to 1.5 million pounds of thrust as Falcon 9 climbs . out of the Earth’s atmosphere. Falcon . 9 is named after the Millennium Falcon starship in the Star Wars movies. The . number 9 refers to the nine Merlin engines that power Falcon 9’s first . stage; one Merlin vacuum engine powers the second stage. They deploy approximately one minute and 15 seconds into the flight and provide control of the rocket to fly it back to ground. The next steps for the rocket will be to launch to higher altitudes, proving the rocket can successfully land in more flight-like circumstances. And, ultimately, the final goal is to use it on a real launch and bring a rocket back to the ground - so far the technology has only been used by SpaceX to bring a rocket to a controlled landing in the ocean after launching to space. In an interview with CNBC, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk outlined the ultimate plans for SpaceX with regards to reusable rockets. 'What we hope to achieve and can perhaps encourage industry to do is to have full reusability with rocketry,' he said. 'It's never been done. You can imagine in any mode of transport if there was not reusability, like aircraft or cars, that there could be very little use of that.' SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has grand plans for his space agency. With help from Nasa he has grown the company significantly in a decade. It is now capable of taking cargo to the ISS with its Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket and, beginning possibly in the next few years, the company will take humans into space . Private spaceflight company SpaceX successfully launched the first of its newly-improved Falcon 9 v1.1 rockets in September 2013 (pictured). The 22-story rocket soared off a launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Station with 60 per cent stronger engines than its predecessor . He went on to state that it would be 'revolutionary' to ultimately be able to recover a rocket booster and then fly it. 'Now we have been trying to do that for 12 years and haven't yet succeeded, but I feel as though we are finally close to achieving it.' He added the firm hopes to recover a booster later this year with a view to re-flying it in 2015. 'This would really mark a significant change in the technology of rocketry,' he said. Space X is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on Earth so that they can be recovered and recycled. Pictured is the Falcon 9 rocket, which will be adapted to use this reusable technology and land back on a launch pad in the future .","SpaceX has completed a test of its reusable rocket in McGregor, Texas .

"By . Ruth Styles . He's created everything from ice castles to oriental palaces and numbers Simon Cowell and Elton John among his clients - and now well-heeled parents are asking celebrity event planner Steven Duggan to create equally lavish parties for children too young to have a clue what's going on. Last month, Duggan created an Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan-themed event for a pair of twins celebrating their first birthday - and charged the parents £70,000 for the privilege. The party took place in a marquee erected in the family's garden in London. While it might sound extravagant, Duggan says it's by no means an unusual event ('we do about one a month') and revealed that non-celebrities tend to splash out far more on private parties than their A-list counterparts. The birthday party included elaborate props such as these flamingos (centre) and flowerbeds filled with windmills . The party had a combined Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland theme - hence forests of polka dot toad stools inside the marquee . Lavish though the children's party was, it's by no means the most extravagant event Steven has worked on . '[The 70k party] was about a month ago and for a private client,' he explained in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'We were asked for a mix of Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan, so it was all themed around them. It was very colourful, with lots of props and lots of lighting effects. 'You'd be surprised by some of the things . we have,' he added. 'It's more to make that child feel totally special even though they . don't know whats happening. The bigger they can have it, the better. 'If it had been a for a 21st or something, it wouldn't have been such a talking point.' Along with props and special lighting, the £70,000 bill also covered the cost of a full buffet, complete with beautifully decorated treats, and a vast Alice in Wonderland tiered cake. The tables were decorated with bouquets of yellow and purple blooms and had centrepieces inspired by the Mad Hatter's tea party . The buffet included a three-tier birthday cake and plates of beautifully decorated nibbles - all with an Alice in Wonderland theme . Duggan aims to make sure no corner goes undecorated and that the client's dream design is realised as they imagined it . Duggan says parents want to create magical memories for their children and that he now does a party a month for younger clients . The Alice in Wonderland interior theme gave the marquee an unabashedly girly feel . Duggan, who began his career as an interior architect and has studied interior design, is no stranger to lavish requests. With clients that include Katie Piper and Harrods, as well as Elton John and Simon Cowell, Duggan has worked for some of the biggest names on the A-list but says it's the creative challenge rather than the opportunity to rub shoulders with celebrities that drives him. 'It's definitely the idea of being more . creative that appeals to me,' he says. 'It's very much about getting . to what clients really want and bringing that fantasy to life.' Are there any limits to what he'll create? 'Not really, he says. 'We're becoming more worldwide now and we've done . events for the Monaco Grand Prix for the last two years but as long as events are creative and the client . has a bit of an imagination, there is no minimum and no . maximum.' For more information and pictures, see stevendugganevents.com . Paper lampshades were used to give the outside of the marquee a fantastical appearance with the help of flowerbeds crammed with colourful windmills . From the outside, the marquee appears to be part of Neverneverland - inside, it's Alice's wonderland come to life . The attention to detail is incredible - down to pink Alice in Wonderland-style signs or flowerbeds and hedges dotted with purple toadstools . Entertainers dressed as Tinkerbell and the Mad Hatter were on hand to amuse the pint-sized partygoers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A New Hampshire girl got exactly what she was after Thursday after licking a flag pole during last week's wicked winter weather. Maddie Gilmartin, 12, says the idea just came to her and she acted on it without thinking twice. 'Did I really just do that to myself,' the East Kingston girl recalls thinking as she waited 15 minutes for her parents to free her. Oops: Maddie Gilmartin, 12, made the once-a-lifetime mistake of licking a flagpole in her front yard during llast week's blizzard . Gilmartin was with her father during the huge blizzard last week that dumped over a foot of snow in parts of the Northeast. The high was 17 degrees Fahrenheit in Gilmartin's New England town that day. While her dad was far down the driveway plowing snow, the idea came to her. 'It just kind of popped into my head, ""Hey what would happen if I stuck my tongue to a flag pole?""' Maddie Gilmartin told WMUR. 'At the moment, I was like, it will come right off.' But she was wrong. And unfortunately, the first thing she tried to do was pull. It was a moment straight out of the classic holiday film A Christmas Story. Only Maddie had never seen the film. 'It just kind of popped into my head': Maddie says she just licked the pole believing her tongue couldn't possibly become stuck . 'I see her standing at the flag pole, her arms are waving,' said her dad Shawn Gilmartin.  'I'm not sure what's going on until I got closer.' He and his wife helped get their daughter loose after 15 minutes. It will take 6 months for the swelling to go down completely . 'I see her standing at the flag pole, her arms are waving,' said her dad Shawn Gilmartin.  'I'm not sure what's going on until I got closer.' By the time he realized his daughter's sill mistake, she'd made things worse for herself. 'She tried to pull her tongue off of it as soon as it happened and that's what made it bleed,' said Shawn Gilmartin.  'I had my hands cupped, I was blowing, breathing on her lips and tongue.' Shawn and his wife frantically grappled for a way to release their daughter and eventually settled on warm water as they waited for paramedics. Maddie is expcted to recover, but doctors say it will take up to six months for the swelling in her mouth to go down. Which means Maddie will have plenty of time to keep pondering the question that went through her head just after her tongue hit the pole: 'Like, did I really just do that?'","'It just kind of popped into my head': Maddie Gilmartin says she licked the pole on a whim and realized within seconds it was a mistake .

"By . Sarah Harris . The rise of online computer games on social media sites could lead to a surge in childhood gambling problems, an expert has warned. They are introducing teenagers to the excitement and rewards of gambling even when they do not involve playing for money. Games such as Candy Crush Saga - which can be played on Facebook - have a ‘moreishness quality’ which hooks players in. Games such as Candy Crush Saga - which can be played on Facebook - have a 'moreish quality' which hooks players in, Nottingham Trent University experts explained . Meanwhile many social media sites offer chances to play online poker with virtual money. Cash gambling sites also offer free-play introductory games and because no real money is involved there are no age restrictions. The problem has been highlighted by Mark Griffiths, director of the International Gaming Research Unit at Nottingham Trent University, who is a world authority on gambling. He believes that teachers have a vital role to play in ensuring that children understand not only the potential rewards of gambling but also its risks. Professor Griffiths wants to see gambling and gaming covered on the timetable during personal, social and health education (PSHE). Such lessons could explore the fact that there must always be more losers than winners. Expert are concerned that free games online could trigger real money gambling behaviour in adolescence . He told the Times Educational Supplement: ‘One of the biggest predictors of whether people become gamblers is the playing of gambling-type games on free-play sites. ‘When you start winning, you start thinking that if I was playing with real money, I could be doing quite well. ‘Children who play those free games are more likely to gamble and more likely to develop problem gambling behaviours. ‘These are gateway activities that can lead people down the gambling road.’ Professor Griffiths insists there is a significant overlap between gambling and seemingly innocuous online games. Many allow players to customise their avatars by spending money on virtual accessories or extra clothing. He said: ‘It’s a psychological masterstroke that people pay money to buy virtual items. The next step is for gambling firms to say, ‘Maybe you could win back some of the money you’re spending’.’ Candy Crush Saga gives players the option of paying money to access higher levels. It has been downloaded more than 500million times. Professor Griffiths said: ‘It’s a bit like the old drug-dealing analogy of giving a bit for free and hooking them in. ‘Games like Candy Crush have a moreishness quality, a bit like chocolate. You say you’ll just have one chunk and you end up having the whole lot. ‘So you say, ‘I’ll just play for 15 minutes’ and you end up still there four or five hours later.’ Writing for the Education and Health journal, Professor Griffiths cites a 2011 study of more than 2,700 British secondary school students, which found that 15 per cent had played free gambling games during the week prior to the survey. One in ten said they had played free games on Facebook. Facebook offers a range of free games online. Gamble Aware, which encourages responsible gambling, said that two per cent of 11 to 15-year-olds had trouble controlling their gambling behaviour . Professor Griffiths highlighted concerns about Bingo Friendzy, available on Facebook, which ‘features cartoon characters similar to Moshi Monsters’, in his paper, Adolescent Gambling Via Social Networking Sites: A Brief Overview. ‘Having studied youth gambling and written two books, I don’t believe gambling games should feature anything that might encourage children or adolescents to gamble,’ he said. ‘Although players have to be aged 18 years to play Bingo Friendzy, research has shown that adolescents regularly bypass the minimum age limits to have a Facebook profile simply by giving false information and/or with the help of their parents.’ King, the company that makes Candy Crush Saga, told the TES that its games were specifically targeted at adult women between the ages of 35 and 50, although the age range of players was currently widening. It added that it was possible to win the game without paying any money. Currently, 40 per cent of players are paying users. Gamble Aware, which encourages responsible gambling, said that two per cent of 11 to 15-year-olds had trouble controlling their gambling behaviour. This is equivalent to 60,000 secondary school pupils in Britain. A spokesman said: ‘Worryingly, those who begin their gambling careers earlier in life are more likely to be problem gamblers in adulthood.’ Social gaming products such as Candy Crush and Bingo Friendzy are created by third parties and not developed by Facebook. They are hosted on Facebook and other social networking sites. Facebook said it has tough controls in place to protect under-18s and vulnerable people. This includes users undergoing checks on their identity, age and that they are located in the UK. The social networking site adheres to UK rules to protect under age people from gambling products. It said that to all intents and purposes these sorts of services do not exist to people aged under 18 on Facebook.","Many social media sites offer chances to play online poker for free .

"MacIntrye alleges Ford conspired with . Payman Aboodowleh, who coached football with Ford, to have one of their . former players, who was also in jail at the time, to hurt him . By . Associated Press . Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is being sued by his sister's ex-boyfriend for allegedly conspiring to have the man beaten in jail to prevent his illicit behaviors from becoming known. A lawsuit submitted Wednesday by Scott MacIntyre alleges the mayor was behind an assault at a Toronto jail in March 2012 that was intended to keep MacIntrye quiet about Ford's abuse of alcohol and drugs. The lawsuit alleges MacIntrye was threatened with 'dire consequences' if he did not remain quiet. He was in jail after being charged with threatening the mayor, for saying he would expose his 'unsavory activities,' the lawsuit says. Rob Ford, accused of planning an attack on his sister's ex, has a history of drug use and tongue slips . Rob Ford may have some secrets he'd do anything to keep quiet . MacIntrye alleges Ford conspired with Payman Aboodowleh, who coached football with Ford, to have one of their former players, who was also in jail at the time, to beat MacIntyre up. Ford and Aboodowleh arranged for staff members at the Metro West Detention Centre to 'ensure 'there was no supervision or surveillance of the area' where the alleged assault occurred, the lawsuit says. Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, said the allegations are 'without fact or foundation.' When questioned further if the mayor had conspired in any way to harm MacIntyre, Morris said, 'The answer is no.' Ford offered no comment when reporters asked him about the lawsuit. The mayor acknowledged last year that he had smoked crack, but he has rebuffed pressure to resign. The lawsuit also names Ontario's Ministry of Correctional Services, which is responsible for the province's jails, Aboodowleh and Aedan Petros, the former football player who MacIntyre alleges attacked him.

"By . Chris Waugh . Follow @@ChrisDHWaugh . To bite another human being is an animalistic instinct and is, quite frankly, inhumane. For someone to lower themselves to that level on a football pitch is wholly unacceptable. Following Luis Suarez's latest alleged attempt to take a bite out of an opponent, FIFA must be strong and throw the book at him. They must act as the IRB have on many occasions in rugby. Cover up?Luis Suarez holds his teeth in pain after allegedly biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini . Inhumane: Suarez appears to bite Giorgio Chiellini during the Group D showdown . Evidence: Chiellini shows the damage inflicted - and FIFA should come down hard on Suarez . Hurt? Suarez holds his mouth after the incident with Chiellini and he should receive a lengthy ban . The Liverpool striker has not bitten a fellow professional once. He has not even done it twice. This is the third time in five years that Suarez has taken it upon himself to sink his teeth into opposing players. There were three years between the first and second incidents, but just 14 months between the second and third. Action has to be taken to ensure he does not do this again - it must be swift and it must be lengthy. FIFA have announced that they have opened disciplinary proceedings against Luis Suarez for his alleged bite on Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 1-0 victory over Italy, and they must set a precedent. In rugby union, the maximum ban for biting an opponent is 208 weeks - or four years - and harsh penalties have been handed out before. The rugby authorities are not shy when it comes to long and severe penalties. They protect the integrity of the game by preventing heinous acts from being repeated through lengthy bans. Previous: Suarez received a seven game ban for biting PSV's Ottman Bakkal while playing for Ajax, 2010 .

Lenient: England hooker Dylan Hartley was only given an eight-week ban due to inconclusive evidence . Undercover: Hartley bit Ireland's Steven Ferris in a ruck during a Six Nations match (centre) Wounded: Stephen Ferris (left) is attended to by a physio after being bitten by Hartley . When South African prop Johan Le Roux bit New Zealander Sean FitzPatrick in July 1994, he was handed an 18-month suspension from the game. In 1998, Bath prop Kevin Yates also sunk his teeth into an opponent, biting London Scottish flanker Simon Fenn's ear, and he received a six-month ban. And England hooker Dylan Hartley received an eight-week suspension for biting Ireland's Stephen Ferris during the Six Nations in 2012 - a lenient ban considering the minimum should be 12 weeks, but the evidence was not strong enough to penalise him further. If it had been conclusive then he would have been looking at a matter of months, not weeks. If football's governing body follow rugby's example then they will come down on Suarez like a ton of bricks. It is time that FIFA act properly and are hard on a persistent offender of a disgusting act. Hot water: Suarez clutches his teeth after appearing to bite Chiellini minutes before Uruguay scored . Nonplussed: Suarez (left) celebrates the 1-0 win with his team-mate Walter Gargano . Too often is it said that football should follow rugby's example in many aspects of the game, but on this occasion they most certainly should. Suarez received a 10-match ban from the FA for biting Chelsea' Branislav Ivanovic last year and a seven-game suspension for sinking his teeth into PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal while he was at Ajax. If you add those two together then you would still be nowhere near the length of the ban that should be given out. For a persistent offender the retribution must be severe. A four-year ban like in rugby? Maybe not quite, but FIFA should be thinking in terms of years and months, not weeks, when they serve Suarez's sentence.","Suarez appeared to bite Italy's Giorgio Chiellini on Tuesday night .

"By . Kirk Maltais . Pictures of a terrifying supercell storm that hit New Mexico on Saturday were captured, depicting the awesome size of the monolithic stormclouds. The storm rolled through Cuervo, New Mexico, producing hailstones that were four-inches in diameter. Cuervo is a community located approximately two hours away from Albuquerque. The state issued tornado warnings for the area for the weekend, but this did not stop some adventurous photographers from capturing the event. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a supercell, which is not always a thunderstorm, is a weather phenomenon in which converging low level winds create an updraft which rotates on a vertical axis. This is also known as a mesocyclone. Warm air in the mesocyclone can rise as fast as 170 miles per hour. Supercells are known to create large hailstones, damaging winds, and tornadoes, and can last for hours if conditions permit. These kind of storms can take place anywhere in the world, but are most commonly found in the midwest of the United States, as well as the plains areas in South America. Forecasters are calling for more severe weather to hit regions of New Mexico and Texas on Sunday. A storm spotter watches the looming storm over Cuervo, New Mexico.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In the 1930s, countries around the world began to introduce white canes, which both helped blind people ‘feel’ the ground in front of them and made them more visible. The invaluable tool has barely been innovated since, but now several companies have developed technologies that help the cane ‘sense’ objects nearby. So-called smart canes use sonar to let blind people know, through vibrations, if there are objects ahead - and which way to go to avoid them. Scroll down for video . The SmartCane (illustration pictured) helps visually impaired people navigate obstacles and people. The device, which attaches to the top of standard white canes, uses sonar technology and vibrations to tell a user how far away an object is and can detect obstacles above knee level, preventing accidents . The SmartCane is designed to help users detect obstacles above knee-level and prevent accidents from occurring. Using sensors, the device detects obstructions up to a distance of 10ft (three metres). It . attaches to the top of a standard folding white cane, currently used by . millions of visually impaired people across the globe. The SmartCane mimics the capabilities of bats, using sonar to detect objects in the surrounding environment. Ultrasound . waves are sent out and, when they return to the cane, they vibrate on . the relevant side of to warn of an obstacle ahead. Different patterns and intensities let the user know how far away an object is. The latest smart cane to hit the market is the aptly named SmartCane, from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi’s Assistive Technologies Group (AssisTech). According to the World Health Organisation, 285 million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide. Almost 90 per cent of these live in developing countries, with India home to the most, at 12 million. With that in mind, the SmartCane is designed to help users detect obstacles above knee-level and prevent accidents from occurring. Using sensors, the device detects obstructions up to a distance of 10ft (three metres). These sensors can detect a small 1-inch (3cm) wide and are adjustable, meaning people of different heights and with different cane holding styles can still use the device. It attaches to the top of a standard folding white cane, currently used by millions of visually impaired people across the globe. Using sensors, the device (pictured) detects obstructions up to a distance of 10ft (three metres). These sensors can detect a small 1-inch (3cm) wide and are adjustable, meaning people of different heights and with different cane holding styles can still use the device . The SmartCane mimics the capabilities of bats, using sonar to detect objects in the surrounding environment. Ultrasound . waves are sent out and, when they return to the cane, they vibrate on . the relevant side of to warn of an obstacle ahead. Different patterns and intensities let the user know how far away an object is. The device was perfected after extensive field trials with over 150 people and is now on sale for the equivalent of £30 ($50). Another, similar device is called the UltraCane. It uses similar technology to help blind people navigate. It comes equipped with a dual-range, narrowbeam ultrasound system that provides a hazard protection area in front of the user (pictured) SmartCane claim the device is especially useful for blind people avoiding obstacles (demonstration pictured) when they don't have assistance, including low-hanging tree branches. Each side of the device vibrates with different intensity if an obstacle is ahead to let the user know which way to move to avoid a collision . An ultrasound sensor kit could enable people with visual impairments to ride a bicycle independently. The . UltraBike unit has sensors to give the rider constant directional . feedback of obstacles ahead and at each side, via vibrating buttons . beneath each thumb. The . device, which is detachable and can be fitted onto the handlebars of . any bike, was designed by electronics engineer and entrepreneur Paul . Clark. ‘Blindness . is not just a medical condition but possesses the larger dimensions of . social exclusion, stigma and neglect,’ said Dr Rohal Paul, who has . played a key role in the development of the SmartCane. ‘Blind . people are often taken by surprise by over-hanging branches, protruding . air-conditioners and parked vehicles while navigating through . unfamiliar terrain. ‘SmartCane warns the user of such objects in their path through a unique system of vibratory patterns, designed to detect potential obstacles even at head height.’ And Dr Diana Tay, Business Development Manager for Technology Transfer at the Wellcome Trust said: 'The SmartCane is a mobility aid device that will have a positive impact on the day-to-day activities of the visually impaired in India and possibly further afield. 'The cross-disciplinary team approach behind the SmartCane has enabled the successful delivery of this technology to the marketplace.' Another device known as the UltraCane (pictured) is on sale in the UK. It comes equipped with a dual-range, narrowbeam ultrasound system that provides a 'hazard protection area' in front of the user using similar ultrasound technology to the SmartCane . Despite its innovation, the SmartCane is not the first such product to hit the market. Another known as the UltraCane was launched in various countries including the UK back in 2011, using a similar technology. It comes equipped with a dual-range, narrowbeam ultrasound system that provides a hazard protection area in front of the user. Two ultrasound sensors provide range data on the closest potential hazards such as plants, people, road signs and over-hanging branches. And two small, button-shaped tactile vibrators on the handle give the user information about upcoming obstacles in much the same way as the SmartCane. Both devices are seen as being invaluable tools for the visually impaired, and could help to drastically reduce the number of accidents that occur when using white canes.","Indian company AssisTech have unveiled their £30 ($50) smart white cane .

"By . Lillian Radulova . When 23-year-old Mandy began complaining of unbearable pain and strange bleeding, doctors told her she was simply too young to have cancer. But after a long battle to get medical professionals to take her seriously, Mandy was finally diagnosed with bowel cancer. But that was just the beginning of her struggle. 'When they operated on her they sewed her bowels almost fully shut and so a few days out of her surgery she couldn't go to the bathroom and she started to develop toxaemia (blood poisoning) and was in excruciating pain,' photographer Nadia Masot, one of the bright minds behind a new cancer awareness campaign, said. 'Mandy was literally dying, but again she had a lot of trouble trying to get the doctors to believe her.' Scroll down for video . Mandy is one of many Australian women who have bared their scars for the Under The Red Dress Campaign. She was diagnosed with bowel cancer at 23 and had 40cm of her bowel removed before suffering from toxic poisoning due to them being sewn almost shut during surgery . Plagued by temperamental bowels, the mother from Bundaberg, Queensland, now has to have regular check-ups for the rest of her life. Her six-year-old son will also need to start having checks from the age of 12. Mandy's traumatic experience has led her to bare her scars and share her inspirational cancer survival story, alongside a handful of Australian women in the Under The Red Dress campaign. The women have posed nude for a book and exhibition to raise awareness for the early detection of cancer, following in the brave footsteps of Beth Whaanga, who made international headlines earlier this year for revealing her own hysterectomy and mastectomy scars. Inspirational: Beth Whaanga was the first to pose for the project after asking Nadia Masot, her friend of 13 years, to take the snaps in a bid to help her with the healing process in February of this year . Mrs Whaanga had a double mastectomy and full hysterectomy in November last year after being diagnosed with breast cancer. The adverse reactions that she received over social media when posting these photos led her to commit to creating a whole book of similar photographs . Ms Whaanga, a registered nurse and criminologist from Queensland, lost hundreds of Facebook friends after sharing the black and white images on her profile, but she also received hundreds of emails of support. It was the adverse reactions that Mrs Whaanga received over social media that led her to commit to creating a whole book of similar photographs. She teamed up with her photographer and best friend of 13-years Nadia Masot to photograph women who have battled cancer across the country for their Under The Red Dress campaign. When complete, it will feature a total of 50 people under the age of 50, photographed in two thought provoking ways. Two sides: Triathlete and mother-of-two, Yasmin, had prophylactic total bilateral mastectomies when she learned her mother had breast cancer . The Under The Red Dress project involves two types of images being taken of each person: The first is a highly retouched version (left) of 'how the world would like to see them'. The second, black and white photos (right), are completely unedited and raw showing 'the reality beneath the red dress' They were inspired to begin the project after receiving several hundred applications from women around the world, who want to share their traumatic stories and learn to love their bodies again. 'I think it was just the fact that we struck a nerve with people, it kind of inspired us the way people reacted. Just all the symbolism behind the red dress came together in this really cool concept and I thought, ""we can either just let the experience pass and it's one of those things or we can use that voice as an opportunity to say something"",' Mrs Masot said. One of the women who will feature in the coffee table book and exhibition, is 34-year-old Menerralea, who considered herself lucky to not require chemotherapy after having two surgeries to remove cancerous tissue while 14 and 19 weeks pregnant. 'She was diagnosed with cancer when she was pregnant with her third child,' Mrs Masot said when asked how she selected the women she would photograph. 'That sort of thing really moves me because you’re making a decision about your life and the babies life, potentially. That really strikes a chord with me because that's a really difficult decision.' Shira is a 34-year-old mother of two living in New York. She had a prophylactic double mastectomy in 2013 as a preventative measure when she learnt she had the breast cancer gene . Arlington, USA resident Liz, was diagnosed with Stage III Invasive Ductal Carcinoma while breastfeeding her fourth baby . Liz had to wean her baby in order to start chemotherapy before she underwent a bilateral mastectomy with expander placement, 36 radiation treatments, and DIEP flap reconstruction . Other women who are taking part in the campaign have had to endure gruelling side effects of surgery. 'One applicant had her breast completely rotted – or so it looks like from the photos,' Mrs Masot said. 'It got gangrene or something due to lack of blood-flow from the failed implant - not implant as in silicon but they use the muscles from your stomach and so it needs to have blood-flow to be able to live, its almost like an organ transplant. 'This one had failed and so her entire breast was black and yellow with pus. 'And so then she's got some after photos once that has been removed, and it's like a gigantic crater that's in her chest. Those sorts of things are quite shocking.' Beth was 39 when she had a nipple sparing bilateral mastectomy. She suffered numerous post op infections which lead to multiple surgeries and medical treatment over the years . She finally managed to reconstruct her breasts through SGAP flap, a fairly new microsurgery tissue from her bottom. She lives in Virginia, USA with her four children and her husband . Explaining how the shots are chosen, Mrs Masot said: 'We photograph them in a way that the world likes to see them; so for example you've got Beth in a red dress looking glamorous. The photos are highly retouched as well so that it kind of almost looks like a photo you see in a magazine,' 'Next to those, we have the black and white portraits which is when they strip down to their scars. There's absolutely no retouching of those photos whatsoever and it's just really raw. Its kind of like 'this is whats under the red dress'. The idea behind that is to really draw that comparison between what you see everyday and what is actually real.' Beside the pictures, each person will have a blurb to describe what they have been through and how they feel about their bodies which have changed as a result of having cancer. Yasmin Grigaliunas, who posed for Mrs Masot after undergoing prophylactic double mastectomies, described how her six and seven-year-old daughters reacted to both versions of the photographs. Brave: Menerralea (left) was diagnosed with cancer while she was pregnant with her third child. She was forced to make difficult decisions regarding both her own life and the life of her unborn child.  Sue (right) has also joined the campaign . 'They both commented significantly that I looked like a model and that it wasn’t really like me, that I had too much makeup on and my skin didn’t look that nice and that I have many more spots than what they could see in the images.' 'When they saw the black and white images I could see this calm more natural behaviour in them and they said ""mum that's more like what you look like"". 'After removing my breasts I look at my body now and I love it more than I’ve ever loved it and I think that the project has really helped me do that.' If Mrs Masot and Mrs Whaanga receive enough funding for their project through their Kickstarter campagin, they will fulfil their original goal which involved photographing applicants from the US, Canada, Europe and New Zealand alongside the Australian women. Nadia Masot and Beth Whaanga are the masterminds behind the new project which will result in an exhibition and coffee table book to promote cancer awareness and positive body image for people who have undergone cancer surgeries . Best friends: Beth (left) and Nadia (right) pose for a photo together ahead of a David Jones and National Breast Cancer Foundation event . Despite continuing to receive criticism for choosing to focus on people under the age of 50, Mrs Masot explained that the collaborating duo wanted to target the discrepancy in awareness amongst younger people who they believe do not receive the same information and support. 'There’s this idea among young people that they are invincible, that nothing is going to happen to them. So it was a choice that we made because we saw it as an opportunity to change that mindset,’ she said. Mandy's story embodied that idea: 'Because you're so young, people are like 'well it can't be cancer'. It can be,' Ms Masot said. 'She has had quite a plight getting doctors to actually believe her when she says that something is wrong, and there have been almost fatal errors. 'The goal is twofold. We want to raise awareness for cancer and get people to be a lot more vigilant in their screening and just be aware of their bodies and what’s normal and what's not. 'But also, if it does happen to you, that it’s not the end of the world. You're still alive, you've got scars to prove it and you need to still feel beautiful.'","Cancer survivors are taking part in the campaign by exposing their scars in a book and exhibition .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A fascinating new book has revealed how an anonymous elite FBI hostage rescue team leader led the charge of capturing the Boston bomber. The Virginia-based leader, who the FBI later requested not to be identified by name, was called to the Watertown backyard of David Henneberry shortly after the resident had discovered a body in his boat. With 'firmness and unexpected humility' he took charge of the high-stress situation, leading dozens of FBI agents and SWAT officers to successfully bring Dzhokhar Tsarnaev out alive. New details: A fascinating new book has revealed how an anonymous elite FBI hostage rescue team leader led the charge of capturing the Boston bomber, pictured . Tense task: The unidentified FBI leader instructed SWAT teams, pictured, to go in and get Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in a yard in Watertown, Massachusetts on April 19,  2013 . According to an excerpt of Long Mile Home: Boston Under Attack, the City's Courageous Recovery, and the Epic Hunt for Justice, published in the Boston Globe, the FBI leader's unit was comprised of 14 operatives, including three specialists in crisis negotiation. There were also two 'breachers,' who had responsibility for preparing the scene for the operation; a K9 specialist, who coordinated all the responding K9 teams; three 'assaulters,' who helped run the show on the ground; two communications specialists; and two snipers, protecting everyone else. 'The team leader quickly won the trust and respect of local police, taking their guidance into account, keeping them informed on next steps, and leading with firmness and unexpected humility,' authors, and Boston Globe reporters, Scott Helman and Jenna Russell write in the book. Then a helicopter fitted with thermal-imaging moved over the backyard and reported that the suspect appeared to be trying to start a fire in the boat, which was carrying dozens of gallons of fuel and could easily explode. Book: The details are revealed in Long Mile Home: Boston Under Attack, the City's Courageous Recovery, and the Epic Hunt for Justice . Imaging: An aerial infrared image shows the outline of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in a boat during the manhunt . The FBI team leader calmly told everyone to back away, the authors write. 'I know this is your party,' the leader told Malden SWAT officer Rich Correale. 'But we're going to want you to back up.' At the leader's request, the FBI breachers launched up to five diversionary devices into the boat in the hope they'd disorient Dzhokhar enough to buy agents and police time to close in on him. State troopers were also trying to get him out of the boat by tipping it over using an armored military-style vehicle called a BearCat but it only managed to puncture the tarp. The leader knew there was only one thing to do. He came over to Correale, the book reveals, and said calmly, with a hand on his shoulder, 'We need to move fast. Get your team. Get a plan together.' Correale got his SWAT officers together, and with himself at the head, the unit lined up in Henneberry's driveway. Expert: With 'firmness and unexpected humility' he took charge of the high-stress situation, his 25-plus team and local police, and successfully brought Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, pictured, out alive . a . Correale explained the plan: that they'd go at the boat, try to get Dzhokhar to surrender and grab at him if he refused. The FBI leader went down the line to each member of the SWAT team. 'Flashing a thumbs up, he asked them all: ""You good with that?""' the authors write. 'The leader told them that if they didn't like what they saw, they should pull back.' As they got closer, they saw the suspect, whose face had been on TV all day, in full view, now on the side of the boat. He looked a mess, Correale said, blood dripping from his head. 'Show me your hands! Show me your hands!' Correale yelled at the suspect. This was the tensest moment for the SWAT team, as Dzhokhar's right arm and leg were concealed. They feared the worst but as his hidden limbs came into view, they sighed in relief as they saw he had nothing. In a flash, the team grabbed him off the boat and threw him to the ground. He was frisked and patted down for explosives and weapons and another cop snapped handcuffs on him before medics worked to keep him alive. All the cops wanted him to survive, wanted him to stand trial for what he'd done. The interesting book is available here.","The Virginia-based leader, who the FBI later requested not to be identified by name, took charge of the high-stress situation in the backyard of a Watertown resident's home .

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A Missouri who killed a jeweler during a 1991 robbery was executed . for the crime late Wednesday, marking the state's third lethal injection . in as many months. Herbert Smulls was executed at the state . prison in Bonne Terre, and pronounced dead at 10:20 p.m. The 56-year-old . had been convicted of killing Stephen Honickman and badly injuring his . wife, Florence, during a robbery at their jewelry shop in suburban St. Louis on July 27, 1991. The U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay . late Tuesday, shortly before the scheduled 12:01 a.m. execution, after . Smulls' attorneys filed an appeal challenging the state's refusal to . disclose where it obtained its execution drug. The high court cleared . all appeals on Wednesday night, though Smulls' attorney had filed . another less than 30 minutes before he was pronounced dead. Death row: Herbert Smulls who was scheduled to die by injection one minute after midnight on Wednesday, January 29 . Defense . attorneys argued that the state's refusal to name the compounding . pharmacy supplying the pentobarbital made it impossible to know whether . the drug could cause pain and suffering during the execution. The state . maintained that the company was part of the execution team, so its name . was protected from public disclosure. Prosecutors said the arguments were simply a smoke screen aimed at sparing a murderer's life. 'It . was a horrific crime,' St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch said . on Tuesday. 'With all the other arguments that the opponents of the . death penalty are making, it's simply to try to divert the attention . from what this guy did, and why he deserves to be executed.' Smulls . had already served time in prison for robbery when he went to F&M . Crown Jewels in Chesterfield and told the Honickmans, who owned the . store, that he wanted to buy a diamond for his fiancee. He took . 15-year-old Norman Brown with him. Smulls began shooting . inside the shop, and he and Brown took rings and watches -- including . those that Florence Honickman was wearing. She was shot in the side and . the arm, and feigned death while lying in a pool of her own blood. Brown . was convicted in 1993 of first-degree murder and other charges, and . sentenced to life without parole. Smulls got the death penalty. Smulls' execution was the state's third since it began using pentobarbital as its lethal injection drug. Missouri . and other states had used a three-drug execution method for decades, . but pharmaceutical companies stopped selling the drugs in recent years . for use in executions. Missouri eventually switched to pentobarbital, . which was used to execute serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin in November . and Allen Nicklasson in December. Neither inmate showed outward signs . of distress. The state said it obtained its supply of the drug . from a compounding pharmacy, which custom-mix drugs for individual . clients. They are not subject to oversight by the U.S. Food and Drug . Administration, though they are regulated by states. Smulls' attorney, Cheryl Pilate, said she and her defense team used information . obtained through open records requests and publicly available documents . to determine that state obtained its drugs from The Apothecary Shoppe, a . compounding pharmacy based in Tulsa, Okla. In a statement, the company . would neither confirm nor deny that it made the Missouri drug. Smulls' lawyer argued that the name of the pharmacy providing the lethal dose should be disclosed (picture from ITV1's Inside Death Row) Pilate contends that the state's secrecy makes it impossible to know whether the drug could cause pain and suffering during the execution process. Smulls had already served prison time for robbery when, on July 27, 1991, he went to F&M Crown Jewels in Chesterfield and told the owners, Stephen and Florence Honickman, that he wanted to buy a diamond for his fiancee. He took 15-year-old Norman Brown with him. Once in the shop, Smulls began shooting. The robbers took rings and watches, including those that Florence Honickman was wearing. She was shot in the side and the arm, and feigned death while lying in a pool of her own blood but survived. Her 51-year-old husband died. Police stopped Smulls 15 minutes later, and they found stolen jewelry and weapons in his car. Florence Honickman identified the assailants. Brown was convicted in 1993 of first-degree murder and other charges, and sentenced to life without parole. Smulls got the death penalty. Missouri had used a three-drug execution process since 1989, until the drug makers stopped selling those drugs for executions. Missouri eventually switched late last year to pentobarbital. Pentobarbital was used to execute two Missouri inmates late last year, and neither showed visible signs of distress. Compounding pharmacies custom-mix drugs for clients and are not subject to oversight by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, though they are regulated by states. On Tuesday, Pilate said that previous testimony from a prison official indicates the state stores the drug at room temperatures, which could taint the drug and potentially cause it to lose its effectiveness. Pilate also said she and her defense team used information obtained through open records requests and publicly available documents to determine that the compounding pharmacy is The Apothecary Shoppe, based in Tulsa, Okla. In a statement, The Apothecary Shoppe would neither confirm nor deny that it makes the Missouri drug. Also on Tuesday, Missouri Senate Democratic Leader Jolie Justus introduced legislation that would create an 11-member commission responsible for setting the state's execution procedure. She said ongoing lawsuits and secrecy about the state's current lethal injection method should drive a change in protocol.","Herbert Smulls was convicted of killing a St Louis County jeweler in 1991 .

"By . Peter Allen . Visitors to Disneyland Paris were today told that safety is ‘the number one priority’ after a boy was seriously injured in a horror accident. Iban, a five-year-old boy from Montpellier, in the south of France, was left ‘fighting for his life’ after falling off the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction. It led to Julien Kaufman, vice president of the EuroDisney group which runs the amusement park, saying everything would be done to ‘work out what happened.’ Incident: The boy had an accident on the Pirates Of The Caribbean ride (file picture) at Disneyland Paris . Insisting that safety is ‘the number one priority’, Mr Kaufman confirmed that police were investigating. Disneyland Paris is the most popular tourist attraction in Europe but, . despite its popularity, it  has been the scene of a number of accidents . in recent years. The latest happened on Wednesday when Iban boarded the ride, which does not require seat belts, with his father. Soon after it started, Iban leaned back and fell out of his boat and was hit by another just behind. Interior: The flume-based ride (file picture) was opened in 1992 at the Paris park and lasts for 10 minutes . The child’s father immediately jumped out to recover him, but not quick enough to prevent the accident. Fabrice . Delin, of the Codis emergency services for the Seine-et-Marne . department, said: ‘He was stuck between the platform and the boat, with . his chest compressed.’ A . Eurodisney spokesman said: ‘Our emergency services intervened rapidly . to provide first aid. The attraction is temporarily closed and we are at . the family’s side.’ In . November 2008, a 21-year old man suffered serious head injuries after . falling seven metres from the Crush’s Coaster spinning ride at . Disneyland. In April . 2011, five people were injured, one seriously, when fake rocks hit their . train on the Big Thunder Mountain roller coaster. Ride: Emergency services were called when the boy became 'trapped between a platform and a boat' Disneyland Paris: Construction started on the 5,000-acre site in 1988 and it opened to the public in 1992 . In October, 2010, a 53-year-old cleaner, subcontracted to Disney, . became trapped underneath a boat on It’s a Small World when the ride was . inadvertently switched on while it was being cleaned. The . man was taken to a hospital where he later died. In December that year, . a 12-year-old boy was paralysed from the neck downwards after going on . The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror freefall ride at the Disneyland Paris . Walt Disney Studios amusement park. He . later recovered. And in January this year, four people were lightly . injured when two coaches collided after becoming uncoupled in the . Disneyland Railroad ride. Disneyland . Paris attracted 16 million visitors last year — twice the number who . went up the Eiffel Tower - but it has failed to make profits since it . opened 20 years ago. Britons are the biggest foreign visitor group to Paris, and thousands of them head to Disneyland every week. Construction started on the 5,000-acre . site in 1988 and it opened to the public in 1992, well over budget. Visitor numbers were lower than hoped for and the hotels fell below . their targets. Two years . after it opened, headlines asked if it was heading for . bankruptcy. But in 1994, banks agreed to restructure the project's . debts. By the end of 1994, the park had turned a corner. New rides such as Space Mountain were opened in 1995 and a second park - the Walt Disney Studios Park - opened to mark its 10th birthday. Now it has celebrated its 20th anniversary. However, it was revealed in April 2012 that the park owed a staggering £1.6billion - and it would take at least 12 years to pay off the debt. Last month a 5,000-strong petition was launched against the park, claiming it was 'falling apart', amid complaints about reheated food, broken rides and cancelled stage shows. Disney did not comment.","Iban, 5, from Montpellier, was left ‘fighting for his life’ after falling .

Amongst the six climbers missing on Mount Rainier and presumed dead are guide Matt Hegeman, left, and climber Mark Mahaney, right . Experienced climber Mark Mahaney was on his second trip up Mount Rainier in Washington state . They were scheduled to reach the summit of Mount Rainier, a dormant volcano located near Seattle, on Thursday, with a day to climb down . 'There's not a viable chance of survival,' Bauer said. Air and ground searches were suspended late Saturday afternoon. The . bodies won't be recovered Sunday because they are in an extremely . dangerous area, where snow, ice and rock fall constantly, she said. 'It would expose our rangers to pretty extreme conditions, so we are not . able to do any kind of ground searching of that area,' she said. 'And, . in all honesty, we may never be able to get on the ground there.' The missing group includes four clients of Seattle-based Alpine Ascents . International and two guides. They were due to return from the mountain . on Friday. Among those presumed dead are guide Matt Hegeman and 26-year-old climber Mark Mahaney of St. Paul. Mahaney, an experienced climber who had scaled Mount Rainier at least once before was identified to KAALTV by his uncle, Rob Mahaney. Mahaney said his brother and other nephew had flown to Seattle to await updates. When they did not return, the climbing company notified park . officials, Bauer said. Adventurers: The climb was organized by the Seattle-based Alpine Ascents International, some of whose guides are pictured here earlier this week on Mount Rainier . The search for the missing climbers (not pictured) is focusing on the Liberty Ridge area, near from where they were last heard from . 'The last contact with them was at 12,800 feet,' Bauer said.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A fungus found growing in the grounds of a former hospital is thought to have originated from the boots of First World War soldiers who were treated their for shell shock. The fungus, Clavulinopsis cinereoide, is relatively common across mainland Europe - though not to Scotland, where the former Craiglockhart War Hospital was based. Ecologist Abbie Patterson believes that troops sent to Craiglockhart for treatment brought the spores with them after picking them up on their boots while fighting in France. Patients: Poet Siegfried Sassoon (left) and Wilfred Owen (right) were among patients at the former Craiglockhart hospital in Edinburgh, where fungus carried to Scotland on soldier's boots has been found . Staff and patients outside Craiglockhart War Hospital in March 1917. Dr William Halse Rivers - who famously treated and formed a lasting friendship with Siegfried Sassoon - is sitting front row, sixth from the left . The hospital, now part of Edinburgh Napier University, was a temporary home to thousands of soldiers during the war - including war poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen who met there in 1917. Owen, who had been sent there for shell shock treatment, was strongly influenced by Sassoon, who encouraged his friend to write poetry and after Owen's death in 1918 worked to ensure that his friend's works were published. Mr Patterson found the fungus on a lawn at the university while carrying out a biodiversity audit of the Craiglockhart campus to log every species growing there.

"By . Ashley Collman . A Daytona Beach, Florida teen is causing strangers to freeze and stare because of her uncanny likeness to Queen Elsa from the Disney movie Frozen. Anna Faith Carlson, 18, became an online sensation when she posted a picture of her posing next to a cardboard cutout of Elsa a few months ago. She says she noticed the similarities between her and the Disney character when she first saw the film in December, calling the experience eerie. Scroll down for video . The ice queen incarnate: Daytona Beach, Florida teen Anna Carlson looks exactly like Queen Elsa from the Disney movie Frozen . 'It's a crazy resemblance,' Carlson told the Orlando Sentinel. 'Every time I watch [the movie], it's weird because it's like I'm watching myself. It's kind of creepy.' But now she's using her storybook looks for good, dressing up as the character to entertain children and cheer-up cancer patients. The aspiring actress is also hoping her online following will secure her an audition to appear on ABC show 'Once Upon A time' which is adding Elsa as a character next season. In an interview with the Sentinel, Carlson recalls how she found internet fame by posting a picture next to a poster of Elsa she found at the mall. The picture that made her famous: Carlson posted this picture next to a cardboard cutout at the mall and became an instant online sensation . Just graduated: Carlson, 18, currently works as a model in the Daytona Beach, Florida area . 'We had just finished a modeling job in Orlando and my mom and best friend wanted me to take a picture with the cutout,' Carlson said. 'My hair was up and I looked like a mess, so I didn't want to at first.' However, when she posted the photo to her Instagram account, the image instantly went viral and now she receives fan mail every day, whether it be online comments, emails or sketches. Since then, she's been marketing herself as a Disney dead-ringer, making appearances at schools and hospitals and even attending a prom dressed as Elsa. Sister, sister: Carlson's real-life sister Lexie accompanies her on appearances dressed as Elsa's sister Princess Anna from the movie . The best of friends: When Lexie isn't available, Carlson's best friend Brittany DuFoe steps in to play Anna . Staying in character: Carlson even attended a prom dressed as Elsa . Her real-life sister Lexie often accompanies her dressed as Elsa's sister Princess Anna from the movie, and her best friend steps in when Lexie isn't available. 'We of course do the appearances for free,' Carlson said. 'I just love seeing the kids and seeing them smile is so special.' Some children have been brought to tears just because they believe Carlson is the real Elsa. 'It is all just so special. It's touching to bring life to a character in front of a child's eyes.' The good queen: Carlson has been making appearances at schools and hospitals, bringing joy to little fans of the Disney film . The work suits Carlson who has been into singing and musical theater her whole life. Right now, she's focusing on her modeling career, but also hopes to branch out into acting. Carlson may have found the perfect opportunity as well since ABC show 'Once Upon A Time' ended it's current season with a teaser, hinting at an upcoming Elsa appearance. Carlson's mother Karen says they've tried reaching out to ABC but 'haven't heard anything as of yet.' She is currently asking her online followers to helped her get an audition by re-posting her picture. Princess paycheck: Carlson hopes her status as a Disney doppelganger will land her an audition for ABC's 'Once Upon A Time' TV show, which will be adding Elsa as a character next season .","Anna Faith Carlson, 18, first noticed her likeness to Queen Elsa after watching the movie in December .

"By . Mark Duell . It is the British Army’s oldest regiment - with actors, artists and Olympians all members during the First World War, and a dog and a tortoise for mascots. Now, fascinating previously-unseen records on the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) covering a period from 1848 to 1922 are being released. The HAC dates back to a charter granted by Henry VIII in 1537, with captain generals including James II, William III, George V and Queen Elizabeth II. British Army's oldest company: The Honourable Artillery Company's second battalion pictured at the Tower of London in circa April 1915 . Downtime: Members of HAC's first battalion relaxing behind the front line (left), and Teddy the terrier dog (right), the mascot of A and B Batteries in Egypt in 1915 . Going abroad: Mena Camp including HAC's A Battery tents and a view of the Pyramids at Giza in Egypt. The HAC sailed for the country in April 1915 . Working: A photograph dated circa August to September 1914 of members of the company's A Battery cleaning harnesses at Churn Down camp in Oxfordshire . Now a reserve company, its solders are . trained as surveillance and target acquisition specialists with skills . in covert intelligence gathering, communications and logistics. Two HAC infantry battalions and five batteries fought in the Great War in France, Belgium, Italy and the Middle East. Around . 1,650 men lost their lives serving with one of these seven HAC units . or, having been commissioned as officers, with many other units of the . armed forces. The newly-released . records reveal some of the men who joined the HAC, including actor John . Laurie, best known for his role as Private James Frazer in the popular . sitcom Dad's Army. Camp: The HAC mobilising in the Artillery Garden in London in September 1914. Two HAC infantry battalions and five batteries fought in the Great War . Harrowing: An April 1917 war sketch by Adrian Hill of the first battalion advancing at Gavrelle, France. The artist created trench sketches of the Western Front . Remembered: A photograph dated April 22, 1915 of a field grave. Around 1,650 men lost their lives serving with one of the seven HAC units involved or, having been commissioned as officers, with many other units of the armed forces . Service: Among the men who joined the HAC is actor John Laurie (fourth left), best known for his role as Private James Frazer in the popular sitcom Dad's Army . Adrian Hill, an official war artist, created his harrowing trench sketches of the Western Front while serving in the Scouting and Sniping Section of the HAC. The new records reveal details about some of the regimental mascots. For example, a tortoise was tied to a battery gun for safe keeping during the Battle of Gaza in April 1917. But it was badly wounded and died as a result of enemy shelling which killed six men. The files also describe how map publisher Edward Fraser Stanford was responsible for the safe keeping of young terrier dog Teddy (right). The animal became the mascot of A and B Batteries, going with them when they sailed for Egypt in April 1915. Despite going missing twice - the second time for over two months in the Jordan Valley during the summer of 1918 - Teddy was eventually reunited with his comrades. It came after a chance sighting with an Indian Cavalry column on the other side of Palestine, and returned safely to England with Mr Stanford when the war ended. And artist and Olympian Edward Amoore won both a gold and bronze medal for rifle shooting in the 1908 Olympics, then went on to serve in the war, becoming adjutant. He was mentioned in despatches in April 1917 before being severely wounded the following month, then later went on to serve on the Home Front in the Second World War. Fellow Olympian Kenneth Powell, who competed in both tennis and hurdles in the 1908 and 1912 Olympics, was a private in the HAC and was killed in action at Ypres in February 1915. Another member of the HAC's B Battery serving in the Middle East was Edgar George Roberts, who was commissioned into the Royal Flying Corps in 1916 and flew with a similar terrier dog in his plane. His HAC record card, apparently filled in by Mr Roberts himself and posted back to the HAC in 1919, says that he crash-landed in France in 1917. The records to be unveiled online include full HAC admission and regimental records from 1848-1922 and a small collection of photographs and letters from the next-of-kin of members who died in the First World War. The records, selected from the HAC's archives, are being made available online by family history website Findmypast. Paul Nixon, military historian at Findmypast, said: ‘It is brilliant to have such an extensive set of military records online - particularly exciting are those relating to World War One. ‘With so many record sets destroyed in the Second World War, it is extremely rare to have a complete set of World War One regimental records. ‘They will be hugely helpful to anyone wanting to discover more about this important organisation and the role their ancestors played in it.’ HAC chief executive Sean Crane said: ‘These records provide an insight into the ordinary men from an extraordinary range of backgrounds who chose to fight for their country amidst the great rush of volunteers flocking to the HAC's Armoury House during the summer of 1914. ‘This tradition is continued by another generation of men and women today as they step forward to serve their country in Afghanistan.’","Previously unseen records on Honourable Artillery Company dating from 1848 to 1922 are being released .

"By . Lydia Warren . A radio host for SiriusXM has been fired after he unleashed a shocking racist tirade on Twitter. Anthony Cumia, one half of The Opie & Anthony Show, called a black woman a 'c***' and an 'animal b****' on Wednesday after claiming she punched him in the face as he took photos in Times Square. On Friday, a spokesperson for SiriusXM said that the rant was 'abhorrent' and 'wholly inconsistent with what SiriusXM represents'. 'SiriusXM has terminated its relationship with Anthony Cumia of the Opie & Anthony channel,' Patrick Reilly said. 'The decision was made, and Cumia informed, late Thursday, July 3 after careful consideration of his racially-charged and hate-filled remarks on social media. Tirade: SiriusXM host Anthony Cumia, pictured in . April, has been fired after unleashing a foul-mouthed rant on an African American woman . he claims hit him in New York City, calling her a 'c***' and an 'animal . b****' 'Those remarks and postings are abhorrent to SiriusXM, and his behavior is wholly inconsistent with what SiriusXM represents.' Despite the latest development, the fouled-mouthed shock jock still showed no sign of remorse. On Friday morning, he tweeted: 'Sirius decided to cave and fire me. Welcome to bizarro world. Fired for s*** that wasn't even on the air & wasn't illegal. So, who's next?' He wrote that he was fired via email, adding: 'F*** Sirius.' His firing came after he explained on Twitter on Wednesday that he was trying to take photos of the area in New York City on Tuesday night when the unidentified woman was caught in the frame. Attack: He shared this image online, saying the woman became annoyed when he caught her in a picture . Foul-mouthed: In another image shared on Twitter, he called her a 'C*** RAG' and worthless . Racist remarks: He posted that there was 'a deep seeded problem with violence in the black community' She . objected to being in the images and punched him multiple times as she . called him a 'white motherf***er', he claimed on his Twitter feed. He uploaded photos that he claim show her throwing punches at him, branding her a 'c*** animal'. 'Savage violent animal f***s prey on white . people,' he continued in the hours-long rant. 'Easy targets. This C*** has no clue how lucky she was. She . belted me 10 times. I had a gun. 'She's lucky I was a white legal gun owner or she'd be dead. Then 5 blacks started giving me s***!' 'I hope a . home boy beats her to death,' he added. 'They aren't people.' In another . post, Cumia wrote: 'There's a deep seeded problem with violence in the . black community. Try to address it and you'll be exiled to racistville. But it's real.' Disgusting: As he ranted for hours, he said that he hopes he gets shot as he continued to racially abuse her . Assault: He said that white people are easy targets because the police weren't going to do anything . Never-ending: In yet more posts, he said that black communities are violent but it can't be spoken about . When . Twitter users asked why he didn't press charges, he responded that there . were no police officers around and that she said she would claim he had . sexually harassed her if he reported it. 'Lying c***,' he wrote. 'I hope she gets shot in her ass f*** face. Ugh.' He added that there was no point taking it further with authorities because he was a white guy and she was a black girl. 'It's really open season on white people . in this day and age,' Cumia wrote. 'No recourse. Fight back and you're a . racist. The predators know this. Good luck.' As he posted his rant, he received mixed responses, with some people pointing out that she had mentioned the color of his skin, while others attacked him for being racist. Predictably, he had no time for that. 'I was assaulted and used ""mean"" words on Twitter and I'M the bad guy in all this?? Lol!' he tweeted. Controversial: His show The Opie & Anthony Show has faced hefty fines in the past for its offensive content . After reports emerged about his rant, . Cumia denied he was racist and was simply giving his attacker the lack . of courtesy she deserved. Cumia has been on air with his co-host Greg Opie Hughes for 20 years in a career that has been dogged with controversy. The show has been fined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) twice. They were fined $21,000 for shows from between 2000 and 2001, in which a 17-year-old girl was told to take off her underwear and rub a telephone over herself. In 2004, Viacom - the parent company of CBS Radio/Infinity-owned stations - had to pay $3.5 million to cancel all pending indecency claims against the show after a segment called 'Sex for Sam' encouraged people to have sex in public places.","Anthony Cumia claimed on Twitter on Wednesday that a woman attacked him when he caught her in a frame while taking photos .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Richard Mellon Scaife, the billionaire heir to the Mellon banking and . oil fortune and a newspaper publisher who funded libertarian and . conservative causes and various projects to discredit President Bill . Clinton, has died. He was 82. Scaife died early Friday at his . home, his newspaper, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, reported. Scaife's . death comes less than two months after he announced in a first-person, . front-page story in his Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that he had an . untreatable form of cancer. Richard Mellon Scaife, the billionaire heir to the Mellon banking and oil fortune and a newspaper publisher who funded libertarian and conservative causes and various projects to discredit President Bill Clinton, has died at the age of 82 . 'Some who dislike me may rejoice at the news,' wrote . Scaife, who acknowledged making political and other enemies. 'Naturally, . I can't share their enthusiasm.' He was the grand-nephew of Andrew Mellon, a banker and secretary of . the Treasury who was involved with some of the biggest industrial . companies of the early 20th century. Forbes magazine estimated Scaife's . net worth in 2013 at $1.4 billion. The intensely private Scaife became widely known in the 1990s when . first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said her husband was being attacked by . a 'vast right-wing conspiracy.' White House staffers and other . supporters suggested Scaife was playing a central role in the attack. Several foundations controlled by Scaife gave millions of dollars to . organizations run by critics of Clinton, including $1.7 million for a . project at the conservative American Spectator magazine to dig up . information about his role in the Whitewater real estate scandal. Scaife rarely gave interviews, but in a sit-down with George magazine . editor John F. Kennedy Jr. in 1998, he called President Clinton 'an . embarrassment.' In the interview, Scaife denied that his money helped support an . effort to hurt the president, but he suggested Clinton might be linked . to the deaths of dozens of administration officials and associates, . including White House Deputy Counsel Vince Foster and onetime Commerce . Secretary Ron Brown. Foster's death was determined to be a suicide; . Brown died in a plane crash. Scaife also accused Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel whose . investigation led to Clinton's impeachment in the Monica Lewinsky sex . scandal, to be a 'mole working for the Democrats.' Scaife's stance toward the Clintons softened years later. In an . interview published in early 2008, he told Vanity Fair magazine he and . the former president had a 'very pleasant' lunch the previous summer, . and 'I never met such a charismatic man in my whole life.' Clinton gave Scaife an autographed copy of his book, and Scaife said . he later sent $100,000 to the Clinton Global Initiative. (Scaife also . said philandering 'is something that Bill Clinton and I have in . common.') Scaife's newspaper also endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for president in 2008. Despite funding many causes dear to conservatives, Scaife was . libertarian on many social issues. He supported Planned Parenthood and . abortion rights, supported legalizing same-sex marriage and marijuana, . and opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Scaife bought the Tribune-Review in suburban Pittsburgh in 1969, using its editorial pages to trumpet his views. 'I fell in love with newspapers as a boy, when my father bought me . editions from around the country and abroad,' Scaife told readers in the . column announcing his cancer diagnosis. 'The day I became a newspaper . publisher, buying the Tribune-Review, remains one of the proudest, . happiest moments of my life.' Scaife was a longtime supporter of Republicans, backing presidential . candidate Barry Goldwater in 1964 and heavily funding the 1968 campaign . of Richard Nixon. In 1972, Scaife donated $1 million to Nixon in 334 separate checks to . avoid paying gift taxes. After The Associated Press wrote a story about . the money, Scaife insisted the Tribune-Review get rid of its AP . service. 'He ordered us to come in and take out the wire machines that night,' Pat Minarcin, then AP's Pittsburgh bureau chief, told The Wall Street . Journal for a 1995 story. Scaife also made headlines in recent years during a bitter divorce . battle with Margaret Ritchie Battle Scaife, his second wife. The divorce . was finalized in 2012. His first marriage, to Frances Gilmore Scaife, . also ended in divorce. A Pittsburgh native, Richard Mellon Scaife was born in 1932, the son . of Sarah Cordelia Mellon and Alan Magee Scaife. His mother was an . alcoholic, and his upbringing has been described as cold and unhappy. He . and his sister were raised by nannies. He went to Yale but was expelled during his freshman year after a he . rolled a beer keg down a flight of stairs, breaking the legs of a . classmate, according to a 1999 story in The Washington Post. Scaife admitted to becoming an alcoholic, and he had a reputation for . having a fiery temper. He reportedly quit drinking in 1990 after going . to the Betty Ford Clinic. The Tribune-Review reported Scaife is survived by a daughter, Jennie . K. Scaife, a son, David N. Scaife, a daughter-in-law, Sara Scaife; and . two grandchildren.

"By . Associated Press . A police raid at an Amsterdam-style cannabis lounge in Denver, Colorado, has triggered a debate over where adults can smoke pot in a state that allows recreational marijuana consumption - but not in public. Denver police showed up last week at Maryjane's Social Club, one of dozens of private pot-smoking clubs in Colorado operating in a legal gray area. The officers handcuffed smokers, seized drug paraphernalia and ticketed the club's owner for violating state law banning indoor cigarette smoking. Three people were cited for smoking in public. Inside the lounge: Denver police raided this Amsterdam-style cannabis lounge in Colorado, named Maryjane's Social Club . Colorado law prohibits recreational pot consumption 'openly and publicly or in a manner that endangers others.' And state lawmakers say that smoke-free laws also appear to ban indoor pot smoke-outs. But marijuana advocates argue the increasingly popular private pot dens are permissible because marijuana isn't sold, nor is food or drink. Like Maryjane's, the clubs are only for members, who bring their own weed. The officers entered Maryjane's on Friday to investigate 'illegal activity' - public marijuana consumption - when they issued the citations, department spokesman Sonny Jackson said. He said police are not targeting other private pot clubs but that all pot-related businesses, including private lounges, are under new scrutiny since recreational sales began in Colorado in January. 'This is new for us,' said Ashley Kilroy, Denver's executive director of marijuana policy, noting that police routinely look for pot clubs that are publicly advertising or who impose cover charges as a sham and then give away weed. 'We're going to be as proactive as we can and educate businesses as we go along.' Kandice Moss, who was inside Maryjane's at the time, said she recognized the plainclothes detectives because they had been inside the club before, posing as new members. One of them told her the club was a public place before they started issuing citations. Maryjane's Social Club (pictured) is one of dozens of private cannabis lounges in Colorado that operate in a legal gray area . 'I asked, 'Where is it safe?'' Moss said. 'He said, 'You're legal to possess it and smoke it at home, and that's it.' But Denver attorney Rob Corry, who represents one of those cited, said the club is private. It doesn't advertise specific events, and it requires memberships to get in, even if to smoke there for just one night. Marijuana advocates argue the increasingly popular private pot dens are permissible because marijuana isn't sold, nor is food or drink . Corry argued the raid was hypocritical. He noted that the city of Denver has allowed the Colorado Symphony Orchestra to hold a series of bring-your-own-cannabis fundraising concerts - labeled private events - after the symphony agreed to hold the shows by invitation only at private galleries. After days of wrangling, city officials concerned about public consumption withdrew their objections to three symphony events called Classically Cannabis, which have marijuana companies as sponsors and are expected to raise $200,000 for the symphony. 'This is an identical situation,' Corry said. 'It's not even close to being a gray area.' The symphony took corrective action after the city warned them about public consumption and Maryjane's did not, Kilroy said. Corry said he was unaware of any formal warnings the club had received. The attorney represents Andrew Overall, who received a $135 citation for public consumption at Maryjane's. Legal gray area:  Colorado law prohibits recreational pot consumption openly and publicly or in a manner that endangers others (library image) Officers said they saw Overall, 25, smoking hash oil from a water pipe, which they seized as evidence, according to his citation. The document also notes that his club membership was issued in June. Overall said he started buying nightly memberships at the club for $10, and then bought a monthly pass. 'It's a place where people who are like-minded can get together and enjoy cannabis,' said Overall, who was supposed to work as a DJ the night of the crackdown. 'I feel safe there.' Overall said he plans to fight the ticket in court. Maryjane's has closed after the arrests. Its patrons hope it would reopen, perhaps as a hookah lounge. Owners of other private pot dens around the state are keeping an eye on the Denver case. 'The number of clubs is going to increase, and the number of enforcement actions is going to decrease,' Corry predicted. David Fanelli, who owns Club Ned near Boulder with his wife, Cheryl, said the club-cafe has not had any problems since it opened in March after more than a year of planning for proper ventilation and consulting with police, an attorney and zoning officials. Still, the town of Nederland has only allowed his club to operate for a six-month trial period. Officials will then decide whether to extend its license. 'We are just a test,' Fanelli said.","Maryjane's Social Club is one of dozens of private pot-smoking clubs in Colorado operating in a legal grey area .

"By . Victoria Allen . and Maureen Sugden . It is a classic whodunnit stretching back more than 40 years to a chance find in a London bookstore, where John and Alicia Makin first discovered the sketchbook. Yet the identity of the artist who sketched the scenes between the 1920s and 1940s remains a mystery to this day. Some of the sketches were apparently made as far afield as South Africa, but a large number are of scenes from Scotland – and the Makins have now appealed for information to help solve the puzzle. Wartime sketch: North Berwick in 1941, with the Bass Rock in the background . Escape from the war: A scene of tranquility on the River Avon in 1941, near where it meets the Spey . Such is their determination to trace the artist that they have published a book of the sketches which feature scenes from the Nairn and Aviemore areas as well as the Firth of Forth, pictured in 1941. Sketchbook Mystery – On the Trail of an Artist Unknown tells the story of the set of sketches which the Makins discovered in a slim blue leather-bound volume when they were browsing in a bookstore in the King’s Road, Chelsea, in 1971. They begin on an ocean liner  in the 1920s and conclude in  London in the 1940s. One clue is the initials JP on the front cover of the sketchbook, but written in an ‘inelegant’ hand which suggests that it may not be that of the artist. Ocean voyage: A shipboard scene sketched on the Balmoral Castle bound for South Africa in 1925 . Table Mountain in 1925: Some of the sketches were apparently made as far afield as South Africa . The early sketches, all dated but unsigned, were done on board the ocean liner SS  Balmoral Castle as she was steaming to Cape Town in South Africa at the end of 1925. 'On and off over the years we have chased down all sorts of clues, but few have yielded worthwhile nuggets for us' John Makin . Next come sketches ‘up country’ in Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and then there’s a pause before the artist resumes sketching in the UK between 1940 and 1942. In June 1941, the artist sketched scenes of North Berwick and the Bass Rock. A month or so later, sketches were made of the Moray Firth near Nairn, and the next week was at Aviemore and the Cairngorms. The Makins have noticed that most of the UK sketches were close to RAF establishments, and they believe the artist – or his or her spouse – was probably in the RAF at the time and  moving around, possibly to help with training. Trying to solve the mystery: It is a classic whodunnit stretching back more than 40 years to a chance find  in a London bookstore, where John and Alicia Makin (pictured) first discovered the sketchbook . African adventure: The Victoria Falls in 1920s Southern Rhodesia . The book even contains a list of all the passengers for the voyage on the Balmoral Castle, in a bid to identify anyone on board who might be able to help join the dots. Mr Makin, 77, who lives with his wife in Oxshott, Surrey, said: ‘We’re especially interested to know if anyone has any pictures or memorabilia relating to the RAF around Nairn, North  Berwick or Aviemore in the  summer of 1941, so we can try and cross-check any names with the passenger lists. ‘For the most part the sketches are dated, so we can pinpoint precisely where the artist was at various times in those years. But who was the artist? ‘The sketches are charming, most likely the work of a gifted amateur rather than a trained professional. Watching: Approaching the island of Madeira. The early sketches, all dated but unsigned, were done on board the ocean liner SS Balmoral Castle as she was steaming to Cape Town in South Africa at the end of 1925 . Drawing: Salmon nets on Moray Firth in 1941. The Makins have noticed that most of the UK sketches were close to RAF establishments . ‘The artist was maybe using the sketchbook as a camera when travelling or on holiday, capturing special scenes for her or his memory. ‘On and off over the years we have chased down all sorts of clues, but few have yielded worthwhile nuggets for us, except the passenger list – hidden among the 225 or so souls listed on the manifest is the name of the man or woman who did the sketches. ‘It is, of course, unreasonable to think that the artist is still alive today – he or she would be aged well over 100. On the other hand, it is highly likely that children or grandchildren are still with us. ‘So our success in identifying the mystery artist lies in one of those descendants hearing this story, directly or indirectly, and recognising a forebear who “ticks the boxes”.’ The list of passenger names, accompanied by a selection of the sketches from the book, can be viewed online by clicking here.","John and Alicia Makin found sketchbook at a London bookshop in 1971 .

"By . Emily Crane . He was just a fresh-faced 16-year-old when he was killed fighting with Australian troops in Gallipoli on November 7, 1915. Roy Henderson Robertson, from Scarborough in NSW, enlisted with the Australian Imperial Force's 20th Infantry Battalion just four months before he was killed. A portrait of the grocer's assistant, who rests at Gallipoli's Walker's Ridge Cemetery, has been in a collection owned by the State Library of NSW for almost a century. Roy Henderson Robertson, from Scarborough in NSW, was killed in action fighting in the 20th Infantry Battalion at Gallipoli on November 7, 1915. He was just 16 years old when he was killed and he rests alongside 29 other Australians at Gallipoli's Walker's Ridge Cemetery . Jack Hodgson was left blind after he was wounded in Gallipoli around 1915. He served in the 4th Battalion and is pictured here showing his service medals to his son . Now, the library has launched an exhibition in a bid to return Roy's portrait, and those of more than 230 other First World War soldiers, to surviving family members. The portraits have hand-written, personal details on the back of each print that denote whether soldiers made it home or not. The majority of photos were taken in 1918 when First World War soldiers in NSW were invited to have their portraits taken in Sydney before they went overseas to fight. William Hugh Gilmour, 19, safely returned to Sydney in July 1919 after serving in the 25th Battalion. The Marrickville resident had worked as a clerk when he enlisted in May 1918 . Thomas Alexander Roper, 20, died of pneumonia on October 11, 1918 in South Africa. The Pyrmont resident enlisted in May 1918 and served as a private in the 12th Australian Reinforcements unit. He rests at Woltmade Cemetery in Cape Town . Ernest William Hall, 20, enlisted in Goodna Queensland on April 25, 1918. He served as a gunner before returning to Australia on April 1, 1919 - just shy of a year to the date he left . 21-year-old Francis Patrick Leonard returned to Australia on July 23, 1919. Francis, born in Longueville, worked as a clerk before he became a gunner in the Royal Australia Artillery . Sydney's Crown Studios, a leading photographic studio at the time, collected more than 1,600 portraits taken of soldiers or copied from existing prints provided by family members. The portraits, which were donated to the State Library, are now being shown for the first time in nearly 100 years as part the WWI centenary program, Portraits of War. They give a fascinating insight into the individual faces of soldiers, both young and old, who served their country. The project was never completed by the photography studio after a fire severely damaged the studio in December 1918. Edward Andrew Bolger was 20 when he enlisted on February 2, 1918.

"By . Alex Greig . A New York woman has taken it upon herself to dismantle a memorial for a 12-year-old boy who died after being hit by a van. The memorial sprang up at Prospect Park West after Sammy Cohen Eckstein was struck and killed by a commercial van when he ran into the street to retrieve his ball in October. The woman was spotted at the 3rd Street entrance to the park cutting all the mementos off the memorial. Memorial: The memorial to Sammy Eckstein sprang up as friends, neighbors and well-wishers paid tribute to the boy with teddy bears, letters and photos . 'The woman came prepared with a scissor and large shopping bag to put the mementos in,' a witness told the local blog F***ed in Park Slope. The witness says a local whose child had been friends with Sammy Eckstein was also passing as the woman dismantled the memorial, located where Sammy was struck by the van and also across the road from where Sammy's mother, father and sister still live. The parent reportedly yelled at the woman, who responded that she felt there had been 'enough mourning.' She also said she felt the had the right to cut down the memorial because she lives in Park Slope. 'I told her I was calling the police and she said she would sit on the bench and wait for them, which she did. The police arrived in less than 3 minutes and the two officers looked incredulous when we told them what she had done,' the witness said. 'Since she was holding scissors and didn’t seem quite right, I felt it best to leave the rest in the hands of the police. Unfortunately I later saw her emerging from the park at the Grand Army entrance.' Grieving: Amy Cohen, Gary Eckhart and their daughter Tamar lost their beloved Sammy in October last year . The touching memorial, which is full of flowers, teddy bears, letters and photos and drawings of Sammy Eckstein sprang up in the days and weeks after the young boy's death. Sammy Eckstein's mother Amy Cohen told Gothamist that a friend had read about the incident on Facebook and informed her. 'I cried inconsolably when I heard but I have no more information,' she wrote in an email. Friends have since replaced the missing items at Cohen's son's memorial. Danger: The Eckstein family want cars to slow down in residential neighborhoods, especially near parks, such as Prospect Park (pictured) and areas where children play . Cohen, her husband Gary Eckstein and their daughter Tamar have been lobbying to lower the speed limit on neighborhood streets to 20 miles per hour in the hope of preventing another tragic death. 'Pedestrians and cyclists do occasionally make mistakes, but they should not have to pay for that with their own lives,' Gary Eckstein said in a community meeting after Sammy's death. He told Gothamist that the driver who killed his son admitted that he saw the ball rolling in the street, as well as other cars stopped, and continued to hit the gas anyway.","A woman was seen cutting down a memorial that sprang up at the place a 12-year-old boy was killed by a van in October .

"By . Darren Boyle . A US entrepreneur is finalising plans to bury three wooden boxes filled with £1,000 in cash and bury them in the British countryside as he expands his elaborate worldwide treasure hunt. Californian businessman Jason Buzi, who is behind the @hiddencash Twitter craze said his treasure boxes will be buried somewhere outside London -but not in the Home Counties. The 43-year-old property developer told his 666,000 followers that the money has not yet been hidden and it will probably take a few weeks to find. US property mogul Jason Buzi has said three wooden boxes containing £1,000 in cash will be buried in secret countryside locations outside London and the Home Counties . Jason Buzi put England on alert with his announcement that he was planning to bury three treasure boxes somewhere in the countryside . Earlier this month 20 envelopes stuffed with £50 in cash were hidden around Kensington Gardens in London. Most were recovered within a couple of hours. However, the clues for the £1,000 boxes will be far more cryptic in a bid to baffle would-be treasure hunters. The clues will be tweeted to followers of the @hiddencash handle. The successful treasure hunters are asked to Tweet a photograph of them with their winnings to inspire rivals. Mr Buzi told The Telegraph that he was following a formula used by British artist Kit Williams who in 1979 buried a valuable golden hare encrusted with jewels in Bedfordshire. Mr Buzi said he would add clues every two or three day to narrow down the locations of the buried treasure, admitting it could take several weeks . Mr Buzi said the boxes will be buried in fields, somewhere in the English countryside outside of London and the South East such as this idyllic location in Dorset . Jason Buzi launched his treasure hunt scheme in the Spring in San Fransisco before unleashing it on the world using this the image of his squirrel . Jason Buzi, 43, is a San Fransisco property developer who made his millions buying and selling houses in the Bay area . Before moving into property a decade ago, Buzi was involved in internet marketing, selling cars and trading diamonds. He said he 'discovered real estate' aged 34. He told his followers: 'I have made more money in a short time than all those other businesses combined. There is nothing like it, unless you are exceptionally brilliant and lucky and have a knack for technology.' He created his @hiddencash alter-ego in Spring, leaving small amounts of cash hidden around San Fransisco and the surrounding area . He has since attracted almost 700,000 followers as leaves cash in locations around the world. Last week he left £1,000 divided among 20 envelopes hidden in Kensington Gardens in London. He said: 'I was so inspired by the idea that this writer could cause such fascination, that so many people could join together in search for something. 'Because the money has gone up we will make the clues much harder, much more cryptic. People found them too quickly when we hid them in Kensington Park; we want to really intellectually challenge hunters with this one.' Mr Buzi said he had no agenda other than to use social media to bring people together in the outdoors. ‘That’s the key thing here – that and brightening up people’s day,’ he said. During the Kensington Park experiment, the first envelope was recovered by Sam Wilson of east London who discovered the envelope containing £50 in cash and a hand written note wedged into a tree stump. She  said: ‘The whole point of this is a game for everyone to get involved. The atmosphere in the park was great.’ Even luckier than her were Adam Mills and Jane Fletcher from north London, who were working together, who found one each – then an extra one. Mr Mills said he was giving the third £50 to charity. In America the sums of money involved are generally $100 a time. After the first hunt in San Francisco the next were in Los Angeles, Chicago and Mexico City.In Chicago the key clue was ‘What do Life of Pi, Lord of the Flies and Robinson Crusoe all have in common?’ The answer was that they were all castaways – and the cash in Chicago was hidden close to the city’s Castaways Bar and Grill. In California, a 14-year-old girl who found some £120 in her envelope wept as she told a reporter that she was going to send it to her grandmother in Mexico to help her buy medicine. Critics and cynics suggest the hunts are either an attention-seeking exercise by Mr Buzi, or a promotional campaign for Twitter, and that the money would be better spent going straight to charity. The lucky few who found the cash, however, have no complaints. Kurt Dee from Queens, New York, found one of the @hiddencash envelopes during a treasure hunt in New York's Central Park .","Jason Buzi said three boxes containing £1,000 will be buried outside London .
Treasure hunters will receive clues following @hiddencash on Twitter .
The treasure boxes have not been buried yet, but clues will be cryptic .

The only clue is that he won't be leaving the money in the Home Counties ."

Living on the edge: One video, pictured, shows bikes riding through the streets and performing tricks . Sources told the New York Post that Cruz's driving had sparked the hour-long chase as he was driving erratically, causing Lien to rear-end him.

Cruz, who is not believed to be among the swarm of bikers who followed the terrified father, was briefly hospitalized and released for minor injuries, including lower back pain, authorities said. Lien, a Columbia University graduate, was taken to Columbia University Medical Center, where he received stitches. Fearful: The bikers had been riding alongside the Range Rover before the incident. Shortly after this moment, the biker in blue jeans - Christopher Cruz - braked . Intimidating: Within minutes, the whole pack has caught up with the vehicle, with the family inside .
