"Diego Lopez insisted that despite an indifferent start to the season, AC Milan have a squad that is strong enough to finish in the top three of Serie A and qualify for next season's Champions League. The former Real Madrid goalkeeper signed for Milan in the summer after the arrival of Keylor Navas in the Spanish capital. After spending the early part of the season as understudy to veteran stopper Christian Abbiati, the 33-year-old has excelled as first choice - keeping two cleansheets in his last three appearances. Diego Lopez keeps Gonzalo Higuain at bay in Milan's weekend win over Napoli . Lopez kept Iker Casillas out of the Madrid side for much of last season . And buoyed by last weekend's victory over top three rivals Napoli, Lopez has set his sights on European football next season. 'Yes, of course (we can finish in the top three), but it will be tough. There are plenty of teams who have Champions League ambitions,' Lopez told Tuttosport . 'Napoli remain perhaps the most credible rival, but Inter and Fiorentina are ascending. Genoa and Lazio are also playing very well.' The top half of Serie A shows there is still much work to do for Milan . On the back of that impressive display against Napoli, Lopez feels that the Rossoneri's trip to face second-placed Roma on Sunday provides them with an opportunity to test themselves against one of the league's best. 'For us it will be a great opportunity to continue on the path of growth,' Lopez added. 'After beating Napoli, we will have to go to the Olimpico and look for three points. It will not be be easy, but we will try even though we face a team that will fight Juventus for the title until the end.' Despite a great deal of competition, Lopez still harbours hope that playing consistently for the Serie A outfit will enhance his chances of earning a place in the Spain squad. 'The national team? I was unfortunate, with (Iker) Casillas, (Victor) Valdes, (Pepe) Reina and (David) De Gea. 'Maybe playing with continuity in Milan will help me go to the Euro 2016.'","Milan sit in sixth place just two points behind third-placed Sampdoria .
Last weekend's win over Napoli was only their second win in eight .
However, the Rossoneri have suffered just three leagues defeats so far .

"Juventus legend Pavel Nedved believes the Italian side's Champions League last-16 match-up with Borussia Dortmund will be a 'very even tie'.

Juve sit top of Serie A under the management of Massimo Allegri while Dortmund are languishing in 16th place in the Bundesliga following a dreadful start to their campaign. And Nedved, who scored 65 goals in 324 appearances for Juve between 2001 and 2009, thinks his former side have a great chance of progressing at the expense of Klopp's men. He continued: 'There are a few teams who are almost impossible to compete with, so we are happy to have a side against whom we have a chance. 'I'm a big fan of Jurgen Klopp and I'm curious to see our level in Europe. 'The games against Dortmund will give us a clear indication of that.'

"Barcelona have come in for criticism in Sunday's Spanish papers after a goalless draw at Getafe left them trailing Real Madrid by four points at the top of La Liga. 'Barca disconnected' reads the headline on the front of AS, which features a picture of frustrated manager Luis Enrique stood on the sidelines in pouring rain. 'We were superior to our opponents,' he said afterwards but Barca were stifled and could even had lost if the referee had not blown for full time when Alvaro Vazquez was muscling his way towards goal in the final seconds. 'Barca disconnected' reads the headline on the front of AS after their goalless draw at Getafe on Saturday . Real Madrid, meanwhile, jet off to play in the FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco this week knowing they'll be top of the table at Christmas. Their historic run of victories was extended to 20 across all competitions when they beat Almeria 4-1 on Friday night. Marca is also keen to hail the defending European champions, calling Barcelona's plight a 'fiasco' and also hailing Pepe, who is 'the cleanest centre-back in the League.' Contrary to reputation, Pepe has made the least fouls and been shown the lowest number of yellow cards in the last 40 matches. As might be expected from a Madrid publication, they stick the boot into Barcelona, saying Luis Enrique had no idea how to get his team out a jam. Real Madrid fly off to the FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco with a four-point lead in La Liga, say Marca . Catalan paper Mundo Deportivo go for the simple headline - 'water' - in reference to the pouring Madrid rain that thwarted Barca's attacking instincts at Getafe. Pictured is Luis Suarez slipping up as he tries to shoot for goal on the soggy surface. 'Barca remained loyal to their style,' they write, but are now crucially four point behind Real. Lionel Messi struck the crossbar but the Argentine missed Neymar, who was left out of the travelling party as a precaution on an ankle problem. While four points does not seem an insurmountable margin to make up, Sport run the headline 'red alert' and there is criticism for Luis Enrique, who has not used the same team in any of his 22 matches in charge. Sergio Busquets suggested that Barcelona's performance may have been down to fatigue following their midweek win over Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. 'We tried different ways of creating danger, we gave it all we could, and we're going away unhappy,' he told the club's official website. 'Perhaps we were still tired after Wednesday.' 'Water' runs the front page headline on Mundo Deportivo after Barcelona were held in the rain by Getafe . Busquets suggested Barcelona can reel in Madrid despite their four-point advantage and 20-match winning streak. 'of course we'd rather be top, but there's a lot of the league still to play,' he said. 'We have to take things game-by-game and start cutting away at the difference bit-by-bit.' Over in Italy, Gazzetta Sportiva tee up Sunday's Serie A action by pointing out that Juventus, Roma and AC Milan all face sides that they've struggled against in the recent past. 'The Bete Noir' is their headline, with a picture of some glowing cat's eyes. Juventus face Sampdoria, against whom they have the worst record over the last two seasons as they try to build on their current three-point advantage. Second placed Roma go to Genoa, where they have lost five of their last six meetings. Coach Rudi Garcia admitted: 'We need to turn over a new leaf.' Gazzetta Sportiva points out that Juventus, Milan and Roma all face bogey sides on Sunday . Milan, meanwhile, host a Napoli side they haven't beaten since February 2011.

"Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard has lavished praise on former boss David Moyes and hailed the 'confidence' of the Scotsman's successor Roberto Martinez. Real Sociedad manager Moyes signed Howard from Manchester United in 2006 on an initial season-long loan deal before eventually signing the American goalkeeper on a permanent basis. And Howard has revealed he thoroughly enjoyed his six-year spell under Moyes. Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard has lauded former Goodison Park boss David Moyes . Howard has also expressed his enjoyment at working under Moyes' successor Roberto Martinez . Speaking to Bleacher Report, Howard said: 'David Moyes was brilliant for me and my hat goes off to him for what he did in his 11 years here. I have a lot of love and respect for David Moyes. 'Roberto has come into the club with ideas and confidence, which is not something that is easy to do because he inherited a bunch of players without a mass exodus.' Howard, who has been combining his Everton commitments with his role as an analyst on NBC Sports, has stated he is keen on working in the media when he hangs up his gloves. He added: 'The options are there. The media interests me a lot. You can keep your eye on the game and continue to learn. 'Coaching is the obvious transition, but I'm not 100 per cent that I want to do it. But if the right opportunity presents itself, I'd be open to it.'

"Batsman Nick Compton has returned to Middlesex with an eye on kickstarting his England career. Compton, 31, started his professional career at Lord's, where his grandfather Denis made his name, but left for Somerset in 2009. His spell at Taunton saw Compton reach new heights, scoring more than 5,000 first-class runs at an average of 55.86 during his five seasons with the county and earning nine Test caps. At Somerset, Nick Compton was rewarded for his impressive performances with a call-up to the England team . Compton (right) scored over 5000 first-class runs while at Somerset between 2009 and this summer . Angus Fraser, director of cricket at Middlesex, is delighted that Compton has returned . He left by mutual consent this summer having slipped off the international radar entirely, despite having signed a new three-year deal in 2013, and there was some doubt over whether or not he would return to county cricket at all. But having relocated to London, he found a willing director of cricket in Angus Fraser, who signed the opener until the end of 2017. 'We are delighted to welcome Nick back to Middlesex CCC,' said Fraser. 'Players of Nick's ability do not become available very often and when we were made aware of his desire to move back to London we immediately moved. 'I was in charge at Middlesex CCC when Nick left at the end of the 2009 season and, even though I could at the time totally understand his reasons for moving to Taunton, I was disappointed when he left. 'It will be great to see him once again wearing a Middlesex cap and sweater, and I believe he has a lot to offer us both on and off the field over the course of the next five or six years.' Compton celebrates after scoring a century for his country against New Zealand in Wellington in March, 2013 . While Middlesex see Compton as an experienced head to lead the batting order while Chris Rogers spends most of his summer on Ashes duty with Australia, Compton has not given up hope of persuading England he can play a part in the same series. And with Fraser as a selector, he is certainly in the right place. Compton said: 'The time I spent at Taunton was great for me. I also fulfilled the dream of representing England, which is something I am determined to do again. 'Returning to Middlesex CCC as a senior player is an exciting challenge for me, one I am really looking forward to. Lord's is the home of cricket and with my family ties here the time feels right to return home.'","Batsman Nick Compton began his professional career at Middlesex .

"Mauricio Pochettino believes Tottenham's fighting spirit evident in their backs-to-the-wall win at Swansea is proof that Spurs players are buying into his philosophy. Spurs had to defend for long periods at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday but Christian Eriksen's 89th-minute winner secured a 2-1 victory which took Pochettino's men into seventh place in the Barclays Premier League. Danish midfielder Eriksen also claimed a 90th-minute winner at Hull last month, which came just weeks after Spurs had struck twice in the final six minutes to win 2-1 at Aston Villa. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino (right) was delighted with the character his team showed . Tottenham's Harry Kane (left), Eriksen (centre) and Jan Vertonghen (right) celebrate their 89th-minute winner . 'The character is very important, to show and fight in every action,' Tottenham manager Pochettino said after Sunday's game. 'We are playing the right way and when you arrive in a different club with different players you always need time to try and put your philosophy on the squad. 'I am happy with the players, we are showing the character we want and we got the reaction we want. Eriksen scores a late winner for Spurs as they took all three points away from the Liberty Stadium . Kane (centre) leaps above the Swansea defence to power a header into the back of the net early on . 'We have a lot of good players and young talent and players like Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane are very important to us.' Kane's header had given Spurs a fourth-minute lead but Swansea created plenty of chances either side of Wilfried Bony's 48th-minute equaliser - the Ivorian's 20th Premier League goal in 2014 - without managing to make them count. However, even though Swansea had the opportunities to get something out of the match, Pochettino felt Spurs were good value for the three points which takes them above their opponents in the table. 'In football you need to score and we deserved to win because we scored. In the last few games we deserve more and didn't score,' he said. Bony (left) slots the ball past Hugo Lloris in the Spurs goal as the Tottenham defence can only look on . 'We deserved more in the first half but then we conceded a goal and Swansea pushed us. 'We defended deep and maybe Swansea played better in this period, but in the last 10 minutes we were always alive.' Swansea manager Garry Monk pinned the blame for a second consecutive defeat on individual errors. Poor marking gave Kane the chance to profit from a corner before substitute Jazz Richards' careless clearance allowed former Swansea defender Ben Davies to set up Eriksen's low drive from 20 yards. Garry Monk (left) gestures towards the pitch as Pochettino holds his arms out and expresses his surprise . Ashley Williams, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Jonjo Shelvey and Ki Sung-yueng look devastated after conceding late on . 'It is sickening, two individual errors have cost us and we were not clinical enough,' Monk said. 'We could have scored a number of goals and didn't. The second half was one-way traffic and if it had been a boxing match it would have been called off. 'We lost it more than they won it and I do not know how we did not win it. It is very hard to take. 'It is an injustice, but football can be cruel at times and we have to learn from that.' Monk was unhappy that Spurs forward Erik Lamela went unpunished for what he saw as several poor challenges, including a swinging arm which left Swansea's Jefferson Montero prostrate on the floor in the first half. 'Lamela had six or seven fouls and was not punished for any of them, which is strange,' Monk said. 'I asked the fourth official did their player touch the ball at any time? 'I don't think he did but that is not the reason we lost.'","Late Christian Eriksen goal earns Tottenham all three points .

"He was one of the earliest and biggest scalps claimed by the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into political donations and former NSW Energy Minister Chris Hartcher has now decided to quit politics. Mr Hartcher, who's alleged to have organised a scheme to funnel illegal donations to Liberal candidates and was also accused of leaking details of the $3000 bottle of wine which would ultimately end Barry O'Farrell's rein as premier, has announced his imminent retirement. He confirmed on Wednesday that he won't be re-contesting the Central Coast seat of Terrigal in next year's March state election. Scroll down for video . Former NSW Energy Minister Chris Hartcher was alleged to have organised a scheme to funnel illegal donations to Liberal candidates and was also accused of leaking details of the $3000 bottle of wine which ultimately brought down Barry O'Farrell's rein as premier. He has announced his imminent retirement from politics . Mr Hartcher's staff allegedly funnelled banned donations from an Obeid family-linked company Australian Water Holdings through a mooted Liberal slush fund EightByFive ahead of the 2011 state poll. It was alleged that fake invoices were issued to disguise illicit political donations from property developers including Sydney's Gazal family and former coal mogul Nathan Tinkler's Buildev. NSW Greens MP John Kaye, earlier this year, called for a review of decisions made by Mr Hartcher when he was water and energy minister. Mr Hartcher's first preference vote in Terrigal increased significantly from 50 per cent in the 2007 election to 60.2 per cent in the 2011 poll. The outgoing MP is the longest serving member of the NSW lower house and entered parliament in 1988 as the member for Gosford. 'It is time to move on,' Mr Hartcher, 68, said in a statement. Chris Hartcher confirmed on Wednesday that he won't re-contest the Central Coast seat of Terrigal in next year's March state election. 'It is time to move on,' he said . Mr Hartcher was also accused of using his nephew to launder $4000 in Liberal Party donations through his old law firm and then through a business run by the partner of long-time aide Ray Carter, before 'pocketing' the cash. He denied instructing Mr Carter - who has admitted to soliciting donations from banned political donors in the lead-up to the 2011 state election - to lie to the inquiry. During heated proceedings, barrister James Trevallion put it to Mr Hartcher that he showed up at Mr Carter's house unannounced in November last year after ICAC investigators began circling. 'You said to him that you wanted to get your stories straight in respect to the $4000 because you knew it was likely to become an issue at ICAC,' Mr Trevallion said. 'And you told him that he should say, if he was asked, that he kept the money himself.' 'I reject that absolutely,' Mr Hartcher said at the time. Under cross-examination from his own counsel, Mr Hartcher also slammed suggestions from counsel assisting, Geoffrey Watson SC, that he leaked details of the notorious $3000 bottle of Grange that brought down former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell. He was one of the earliest and biggest scalps claimed by the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into political donations and former NSW Energy Minister Chris Hartcher has now decided to quit politics . 'I deeply resent that question being asked and it was completely untrue,' he said. In the wake of the ICAC inquiry, former police minister Mike Gallacher has moved to the cross-bench while The Entrance MP Chris Spence and Wyong MP Darren Webber have announced they too won't re-contest their seats. The ICAC inquiry report is due in January, two months ahead of the state election in which the Liberals will field at least three new Central Coast candidates.","Chris Hartcher is the former NSW Energy Minister .

"A North Carolina U.S. senator had a PR nightmare Tuesday night after she failed to show up for a televised debate, leaving an empty chair to stand in for her. Kay Hagan, a Democrat struggling to keep her Senate seat in a year when Republicans have captured most of the political momentum, let North Carolina Republican House Speaker Thom Tillis have the entire hour to himself, taking questions from two moderators. 'This is more of a conversation with Speaker Tillis, as opposed to a debate,' remarked Tim Boyum, a Time Warner Cable News anchor tapped to anchor the event. The race is a virtual dead heat, with Hagan polling 2 percentage points ahead – a razor-thin lead that's inside the margin of error. North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis got an unfiltered hour of 'debate' time to himself on Tuesday when Senator Kay Hagan refused to show up . Embattled: Sen. Hagan is dogged by new allegations that her husband's company got $387,000 from the 2009 Obama stimulus bill – which she voted for . Hagan's decision to ditch the debate was a political calculation that seemed to backfire . 'I'm disappointed that Senator Hagan's not here,' Tillis said in his closing statement, 'particularly because just two days from now North Carolina voters are going to go cast their ballots in early voting.' The episode brought conservative partisans out of the woodwork on Twitter, with many comparing Hagan's empty chair to another, more famous one. At the 2012 Republican National Convention, film star Clint Eastwood set up an empty chair representing President Barack Obama and carried on an imaginary conversation with it – complete with pregnant pauses – in front of a nationwide prime-time audience. 'What do you want me to tell Romney?' he asked the chair, referring to Mitt Romney, the president's GOP opponent. 'I can't tell him to do that to himself,' Eastwood said, after allowing a few seconds for the invisible Obama to talk to him. 'You're crazy, you're absolutely crazy,' he said. 'You're getting as bad as Biden.' Tillis, too, made his hour-long messaging monopoly about the president. 'If you want to change President Obama's policies, you have to change your senator,' he said. Tillis has hit the president hard for his 2009 stimulus package, now that Hagan stands accused of benefiting from her 'yes' vote to pass it. Her husband's company received more than $387,000 in government handouts and tax credits under the program's renewable energy provisions. Tillis' latest staetwide ad includes a narrator recounting the history. 'Days after Kay Hagan took office, she pushed Obama's stimulus bill,' the voice says before cutting to a clip of Hagan saying the infusion of cash would help the country's economy move forward. 'It didn't,' he says. 'But it did help Kay Hagan move forward personally.' Clint Eastwood talked to an empty chair – representing President Barack Obama – during the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida . Some on Twitter quickly remembered the last time a political audience was treated to the sight of an empty chair . MSNBC commentator and liberal firebrand Rachel Maddow castigated the Hagan campaign for giving the Republican challenger an unfiltered approach to voters. 'The moderator explained that Thom Tillis' answers wouldn't be timed – they were otherwise planning on timing them – because nobody else needed to talk!' she exclaimed. 'So for you, voters, we present this hour-long conversation with just the Republican candidate. On TV. For an hour. Uncontested,' Maddow continued in disbelief, “so he can tell you what he thinks without any time constraints and without anybody rudely interrupting. Two weeks before Election Day.' 'Did I mention this race is basically tied? I did mention that.' Hagan's campaign team busied itself during the debate sending journalists a steady stream of emails contesting Tillis' points as he made them – a tactic that fell flat as reporters wondered why the candidate didn't participate and make her points in person. 'Hagan declined to attend tonight's debate,' a Buzzfeed reporter tweeted. 'Yet so many fact-checks in my inbox.' The Tarheel State race is on pace to become the most expensive U.S. Senate contest ever mounted, costing the two sides and their surrogate groups an estimated $100 million in ad buys and other costs.","North Carolina Democratic Sen.

The winners for 2014 have been revealed by beautyheaven.com.au, listing the  very best hair, makeup and skincare products on the market. Scroll down to see the Best in Beauty Awards of 2014 . Winners of the Best in Beauty awards 2014 have been announced by leading Australian beauty website beautyheaven.com.au . Senior content producer of beautyheaven, Olivia Mackinnon, told Daily Mail Australia that the winning products were must-have essentials for any busy woman. Senior content producer of beautyheaven Olivia Mackinnon told Daily Mail Australia why some of the winning products were favoured. Best Hair Treatment - Moroccanoil Original Treatment . ‘I’m a big fan of the Moroccanoil Original Treatment because it’s the best treatment for hair,’ she said. 'It’s great to use as a damp in conditioner when you’re out of the shower to give your hair feeling soft and nourished. ‘It’s easy and versatile to use and you can mix it with other products. I usually mix mine with gel.’ Best Foundation - Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay-In-Place Makeup . ‘The best thing about this foundation is it’s a semi matte liquid foundation for oily skin to give you that hint of radiant and sleek look,’ she said. ‘It controls oil and it’s definitely another one that’s getting a cult status because there’s a huge following behind it. Best Mascara - Benefit They’re Real Mascara . ‘The Benefit They’re Real Mascara is a front runner because it has won the same award from last year,' she said. It’s an innovative mascara that gives that false lash effect and it’s under $40 so people find it reasonable. Best Lipstick - YSL Rouge Pur Couture Lipstick . ‘It has a beautiful gold casing and some of our reviews have said you don’t need to reapply because it lasts long,' she said. ‘We know what works,' said Olivia. 'These products were judged upon what was consistently reliable after gathering a cult status from our beautyheaven members.' beautyheaven members voted over 2000 times for the products they loved, ensuring that the beauty essentials were ones that worked well and were used across a wide range of customers. ‘There was a real mix of winners across all categories where we were able to find the higher end products and brands that have been successful over the year,' she said. ‘The awards are about establishing and rewarding cult products, so it makes sense that some of the winners are those that have made their way into the hands and hearts of consumers and win time and time again,’ she said. ‘It helps men and women across Australia determine the crème-de-la-crème of what is out there, discovering the hidden beauty essentials of others along the way!’ Among the product winners for 2014 were a few familiar brands, holding onto their titles from last year. This was the case for Benefit Hoola as Best Bronzer and ghd eclipse as Best Straightener. ‘The Maybelline tattoo liquid eyeshadow was really popular and won an award two years in a row. It’s different to other eyeshadows because it gives incredible pigment to eyelids,' Olivia said. For the best beauty advice, Olivia said that one of the best tips she had come across was to find a celebrity with similar resemblance to yourself for inspiration. ‘Find a celebrity who has the same skin tone or similar facial features to you,' she said. ‘I look at Leighton Meester and if I see her on the Red Carpet rocking blue eye-liner, I’d feel confident that I could pull that off too. Beauty muse is really helpful.' Pictured from left to right - Lanolips Lip Ointment with Colour, Moroccanoil Original Treatment and Biore Self Heating One Minute Mask . Members had to submit reviews and give products star ratings with an additional secret ballot to reveal the most highly regarded products in each category . ‘Something else I was told a long time ago is to be cautious of what you’re putting in your hair. ‘Don’t overload with hair products because less is more in what I use and these products are designed to last. Too much protein can make it stiff and can’t move in the wind. Olivia said that for all conditioners, especially the three-minute hair treatments, are best left on as long as possible to get the best benefits and allow enough time for nutrients to penetrate the hair. 'You need to leave them on for at least 10 minutes to work because you're basically washing your hair mask down the sink,' she said. 'My advice is to leave it in your hair as long as you can – while you’re vacuuming or running some errands around the house before rinsing.' Australia’s beauty experts have made it their mission to find the best beauty products that’ll make you look and feel amazing . It's not all about the new and improved though, with a few classics remaining a necessity for any beauty-lover. 'Red lipstick will never go out of style. There are so many different shades of red, including pink, coral and orange,' she said. 'I think every girl would suit one of these colours and it makes you look classy and it's the perfect way to lift you up.' Benefit and Garnier swept up the most awards with three products each in the make-up, skincare and hair categories.

"The White House plans to defy Congress and permanently shutter the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, setting the stage for an epic throw-down on Capitol Hill over the future home of 149 terrorists – including some of the most dangerous individuals the U.S. has ever captured. Barack Obama signed an executive order on the first day of his presidency declaring his intention to close down 'Gitmo,' as it's called in Pentagon circles, and send its population of war-on-terror captives to domestic prisons or repatriate them. Both Congress and the American public strongly oppose the plan. House Speaker John Boehner told MailOnline in a statement that 'even as Islamic jihadists are beheading Americans, the White House is so eager to bring these terrorists from Guantanamo Bay to the United States that it is examining ways to thwart Congress and unilaterally re-write the law.' Former President George W. Bush declined comment through a spokesman. But a Kansas Republican lawmaker – facing the possibility of seeing Obama transfer Guantanamo's inmates to his state's Leavenworth maximum security prison – pledged Friday during a campaign event that 'if he tries it ... I will shut down the Senate!' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . To close or not to close? The most hardened anti-American terrorists are housed at Gitmo, but President Obama wants to close it and transfer every detainee either to U.S. prisons or back to their countries of origin . Muslim prisoners at Gitmo are shown in morning prayers, far away from their onetime US targets . Tough choice: Obama campaigned on a promise to close Guantanamo by the beginning of 2010, and his post-presidential legacy is beginning to weigh on him . Sen. Pat Roberts is in the political fight of his life and needs to create headlines, but Obama faces real hurdles: how to accomplish what Congress has made illegal, with money it has forbidden him to spend, and where to put the orange-jumpsuited prisoners who call Gitmo home. 'Not only is this scheme dangerous,' Boehner said, 'it is yet another example of what will be this administration’s legacy of lawlessness.' Gallup polled Americans in June after Obama swapped five Taliban prisoners for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdal, who reportedly deserted his unit in Afghanistan before being captured. Just 29 per cent supported closing Guantanamo, and 66 per cent were opposed. It's clear that there's nothing resembling serious support for the idea on Capitol Hill. In May 2009, with both houses of Congress in Democratic hands, the Senate voter 90–6 against adding $80 million to the U.S. defense budget that Obama had requested to pay for his plan. 'The American people don’t want these men walking the streets of America’s neighborhoods,' South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune said at the time. 'The American people don’t want these detainees held at a military base or federal prison in their back yard, either.' Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe told MailOnline on Friday that Obama's zeal to close Gitmo for political gain 'is exceeded only by his willingness to bypass Congress and ignore the law in order to accomplish it.' 'With the threat of terrorism on the rise, the president should be focusing on strengthening U.S. national security,' Inhofe said, 'but instead he is attempting to check boxes before the midterm elections.' The Wall Street Journal noted Friday that most of the facility's prisoners – there were 800 enemy combatants there at one point – were released before Obama took office. But those who remain are a boiled-down worst-of-the-worst, the most hardened terrorists the U.S. has ever put in handcuffs. Gloves off: House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, blasted Obama's Gitmo plan as part of a 'legacy of lawlessness' At what cost? Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was freed from captivity in May after Obama traded him for five hardened Taliban fighters . Now former CIA Director James Woolsey says the 'Taliban Five' were released because the White House wants to shrink the Gitmo population to a size where maintaining the prison won't make economic sense . The Journal cited an unnamed senior administration official who said Obama is 'unwavering in his commitment' to closing the prison, and wants options for a coming day when he lays out his presidential legacy. Congress bans the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. each year when it sends the National Defense Authorization Act to the president for his signature. Obama would face a firestorm of angry lawmakers if he were to hamstring the Pentagon by vetoing the entire bill over that provision.He would also risk a slap from the Supreme Court, and a relentless public backlash – especially from Americans in states with prisons that could house transferred detainees – if he chose to ignore Congress' restraints and do it anyway. Worst of the worst, but where to put him? Khalid Sheikh Mohammad was the top organizer of the 9/11 terror attacks . That could come via a 'signing statement,' a controversial self-administered vaccine against Congress that some presidents have used to indicate that they're enacting a law even though they think narrow parts of it are unconstitutional. Former CIA Director James Woolsey said Friday morning that the president is desperate enough to whittle down Guantanamo's numbers that he seized the opportunity in May to clear out five captives through a prisoner swap while freeing Bergdahl. 'I think the Bergdahl trade ... was about trying to get rid of terrorists that are incarcerated in Gitmo, get them taken by somebody else or freed, so there's less and less pressure on the president to keep Gitmo going,' Woolsey said on the Fox News Channel. The numbers suggest Woolsey could be right. It costs the Pentagon $2.7 million per year to keep each inmate at Gitmo. The comparable annual cost for housing a prisoner at a Supermax prison in the U.S. is just $78,000. 'As the number becomes smaller at Guantanamo, the case for domestic transfers ... becomes that much stronger,' a senior administration official told the  Journal. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found in August that the White House broke federal law by spending nearly $1 million on the Bergdahl prisoner swap despite a congressional ban. 'I think it is dangerous,' Woolsey added. 'And they're down now to 149, I think, prisoners. And most of these, like Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, are really dyed-in-the-wool terrorists.'","The White House is mulling ways to fulfill the president's promise to close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba but it houses 149 terrorists .

"Five people who had contact with a woman who died of an unusual strain of tuberculosis in far north Queensland have tested positive to a dormant version during screenings for the disease. Queensland Health on Tuesday confirmed the 32-year-old Cairns woman died from a multi-drug resistant strain of TB after being admitted to Cairns Hospital in September. Thirty people believed to have been in contact with the woman, who travelled regularly to the Torres Strait and Papua New Guinea, have already been tested by the Cairns TB Control Unit. Of those, five have returned a positive Mantoux test result.

Thirty people were tested for TB (pictured) but five of them came back with positive results. But health officials say this does not mean that they are a risk to others . However health officials have been quick to point out this does not necessarily mean they are a risk to others. 'A positive Mantoux test simply indicates that a person may have been infected with TB at some point in their life,' said Dr Richard Gair from the Tropical Public Health Unit in Cairns. 'It does not indicate that the infection was acquired from a particular person. Dr Gair said patients with an inactive form of TB, called latent TB, were not infectious. 'It is not possible to get TB from someone with latent tuberculosis,' he said. 'The main risk of latent TB is that some patients may go on to develop active TB at a later stage in their lives.' Twenty more people who have come in contact with the woman, who had been in close contact with another patient who died of TB last year, are still yet to be tested.

"Anyone hoping to one day emulate the likes of time travellers Doctor Who or Marty McFly in Back To The Future has just been dealt a devastating blow. Researchers from Michigan have scoured websites, search engine results and social networks dating back as far as 1996 in search of people who discussed select events before they happened. They even asked time travellers from the future to tweet using a specific hashtag. Yet despite comprehensive analysis of . thousands of records, they were unable to find . any evidence time travellers existed. Anyone hoping to emulate the likes of time travellers Dr Emmett Brown (left) and Marty McFly (right) in Back To The Future have been dealt a devastating blow. Researchers from Michigan scoured web results back to January 1996 in search of people who discussed events before they happened - yet found nothing . Travelling through time may not be the far-fetched science fiction theory it was once thought to be, according to Professor Brian Cox. 'If you go fast, your clock runs slow relative to people who are still.' explained Cox. 'As you approach the speed of light, your clock runs so slow you could come back 10,000 years in the future.' The theory is based on Einstein's Theory of Special Relatively that states to travel forward in time, an object would need to reach speeds close to the speed of light. However, he said this theory only works when travelling to the future, and it's not possible to come back. He added that if the technology was developed to accelerate larger objects, it could be possible for humans to travel to the future, similar to Doctor Who's Tardis in the TV show. Yet this technology doesn't exist yet, and will never exist that could take people to the past. Since the late 1800s, writers and filmmakers have been obsessed with the allure and intrigue of time travel from H.G Wells’ 1895 book The Time Machine to the Back To The Future franchise and Doctor Who. Inspired by this fascination, Professor Nemiroff, along with a MTU graduate Teresa Wilson, wanted to use the web to try and find evidence of people from the future living among us. They began by selecting two events from recent history - the Comet ISON in September 2012 and the appointment of Pope Francis in March 2013. They then scanned websites and search engine results for conversations or references to these events made between January 2006 and September 2013. 'Were a time traveller from the future to access the internet of the past few years, they might have left once-prescient content that persists today,’ explained Nemiroff and Wilson. 'Such content might have been catalogued by search engines such as Google or Bing, or remain in posts left on Facebook, Google Plus or Twitter.' They spent months researching and scanning these sites for mentions of the comet and Pope Francis before the respective events took place, but concluded there was no ‘clearly prescient’ mention of either. To verify evidence of time travellers, the researchers choose two events from recent history - the Comet ISON in September 2012, left, and the appointment of Pope Francis in March 2013, right.  They then scanned websites for prescient conversations or references to these events dating back to January 2006 . They then asked time travellers to send tweets using either hashtags ‘#ICanChangeThePast2’ or ‘#ICannotChangeThePast2’ before the end of August 2013. The request was deliberately made in September in the hope that a time traveller would see the tweet in the future before travelling back to the past to tweet it before the end of August. However, no tweets were sent that predated the original request. 'No time travellers were discovered,' said the researchers. 'Although these negative results do not disprove time travel, given the great reach of the internet, this search is perhaps the most comprehensive to date.' The researchers only searched for time travellers from the future because firstly, the results could be verified, and secondly, as Nemiroff explained: ‘To the best of our knowledge, human technology to create a time machine does not exist in the past, so that time travellers from the past must originate in the future, assuming such technology is ever developed.’","Physicists scanned websites, search engine results, tweets and emails .

"Liberal MP Wyatt Roy and comedian Josh Thomas have swapped insults in a Twitter stoush about children in detention centres. Josh Thomas, star of ‘Please Like Me’, took offence to a tweet from Roy about the Liberal party’s treatment of asylum seekers. The Federal Member for Longman had claimed, ‘1100 deaths at sea, 1400 children in detention. Our policies have saved lives – a fact lost on Labor members.’ The comedian, 27, instigated a fiery feud by quizzing the Liberal MP about the alleged sexual assault of children in Australia's detention centres. ‘Our government didn’t actually rape, kids did it?’ asked Thomas, accompanied by an article about the reported abuse. Scroll down for video . Comedian Josh Thomas has found himself in the middle of another heated exchange with a politician, when he took Liberal MP Wyatt Roy to task on the issue of asylum seekers . The Twitter stoush escalated when Josh Thomas referred to allegations that children in detentions centres have been the subject of sexual abuse. Wyatt Roy retaliated with an insult that referred to the title of Thomas' ABC TV show, Please Like Me . Wyatt Roy is the Federal Member for Longman. He had posted a tweet saying the Australian government is now implementing policies that are saving asylum seekers' lives . There were 33 reported cases of sexual abuse involving children in detention centres between January 2013 and March 2014. Allegations also emerged last month that guards at Nauru detention centre have been sexually assaulting refugees. The 27-year-old comedian began the argument by tweeting: ‘You’re being a twerp’, meaning a ‘silly, weak-minded, contemptible person’. Thomas took the 24-year-old MP to task over the Liberal government’s policies, also asking about cuts to foreign aid and the deportation of gay refugees to Papua New Guinea 'where homosexuality is illegal'. Josh Thomas' first tweet, igniting the feud, was the simple four word insult: 'You're being a twerp' Roy and Thomas swapped barbs on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon about the Liberal party's policies . The Federal member for Longman retaliated, lashing out at the ‘Please Like Me’ star. ‘No wonder you have to ask ppl to like you (sic),’ Wyatt Roy tweeted to Thomas. ‘Is this part of your routine? I wouldn’t open with that in any company.’ The Federal MP’s first tweet was accompanied by a YouTube video of Roy speaking in parliament, accusing the Labor party of being responsible for the death of 1100 asylum seekers at sea. Thomas pushed the MP to answer questions about the current state of Australia's immigration. ‘If the goal of being cruel to asylum seekers is to deter people from getting on boats then why the secrecy?’ Thomas tweeted to Roy. ‘And why not be crueller? We are a great, rich nation. Kick them in the balls, film it and put it on YouTube.’ Josh Thomas ABC show Please Like Me was nominated for an International Emmy in the comedy category . Roy responded to Thomas, defending the changes the Liberal party have made to their policies. ‘What is kind about ppl drowning & kids in detention (sic)? We can now take more of the world’s vulnerable,’ Roy tweeted. When Thomas then asked about the rape allegations, Roy lashed out at the comedian. ‘really? Is this where you are going with this conversation. No wonder you have to ask ppl to like you,’ Roy responded, referring to the name of Thomas’ ABC television program, Please Like Me. Wyatt Roy became the youngest person to ever be elected to Australian parliament in 2010 . The Liberal MP told Thomas there are ‘516 fewer children in detention compared to when we came into office,’ standing by his belief that Liberal policies are saving lives. Josh Thomas continued the debate, discussing the actions of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Scott Morrison. ‘There are less (children in detention) because loads were sent back to danger. It’s not good having @ScottMorrisonMP as your legal guardian,' he tweeted. Josh Thomas also took a swing at the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Scott Morrison . Earlier this month, Josh Thomas was involved in another heated exchange with a politician whilst appearing on ABC program Q&A. He criticised north Queensland MP Bob Katter for his refusal to address homosexual issues as a politician. 'You say that it's (mental health issues amongst the gay community) not a priority but you talk about it quite a bit, and when you do talk about it you say awful things,' began Mr Thomas. 'All you need to do (is) say you say you know what, I've said some things in the past, it was a mistake,' said Mr Thomas, telling Mr Katter how to move forward in a more positive manner. '(You need to say) I understand now, it's (Mr Katter's comments) hurting people's mental health, it's part of the problem, not part of the solution. 'I'm sorry, hooray for homosexuals, here's some glitter.'

"Following reports Facebook manipulated the feeds of almost 700,000 users, the site has issued a statement claiming it 'never met to upset anyone'. During one week in 2012, the social media giant edited feeds to highlight either positive or negative items, and then monitored responses. The site has since apologised for the way the paper described the research, and any anxiety that was caused, adding, 'the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this.' Scroll down for video . During one week in 2012, Facebook manipulated feeds of just over 689,000 users to highlight either positive or negative items, and then monitored responses over the course of a random week. The site has since apologised for the way the paper described the research, and any anxiety that was caused . The California-based firm carried out the experiment during a week in 2012. During that time, negative posts were deprioritised in the data feeds of 689,003 users, to see if it generated a more positive response. Posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word. The experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500. According to Facebook, nobody's posts were 'hidden,' they just didn't show up on some feeds. It found that negative posts elicited a . swell of positive responses, but also that a reduction in positive news . led to more negative posts. ‘When . positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts . and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the . opposite pattern occurred,’ said the researchers. ‘The reason we did this research is because we care about the emotional impact of Facebook and the people that use our product,' said Facebook data scientist Adam D. I. Kramer. ‘We felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out. ‘At the same time, we were concerned that exposure to friends' negativity might lead people to avoid visiting Facebook. We didn't clearly state our motivations in the paper. 'Having written and designed this experiment myself, I can tell you that our goal was never to upset anyone.' During the experiment, Facebook deprioritised content in News Feeds, based on whether there was an emotional word in the post. Tests affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500 - for a week, in early 2012. According to Kramer, nobody's posts were 'hidden,' they just didn't show up on some feeds. 'Those posts were always visible on friends' timelines, and could have shown up on subsequent News Feed loads.' It found that negative posts elicited a . swell of positive responses, but also that a reduction in positive news . led to more negative posts, according to the results of a study . published in PNAS Journal. Facebook data scientist Adam D. I. Kramer issued a statement over the weekend (pictured). He said: 'The reason we did this research is because we care about the emotional impact of Facebook.

The . findings led the team to conclude that ‘in-person interaction and . nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion.’ This . experiment was limited to users who viewed Facebook in English, but it . is not known across which geographic boundaries. 'At the end of the day, the actual impact on people in the experiment was the minimal amount to statistically detect it - the result was that people produced an average of one fewer emotional word, per thousand words, over the following week,' continued Kramer.

'In hindsight, the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety.' Commenting on the reports, Brett Dixon, director of the digital marketing agency DPOM, said:  'Despite Facebook's insistence this was merely an academic experiment, it sails perilously close to the illegal world of subliminal advertising. 'There's a reason this insidious form of manipulation is banned - it is an abuse of people's freedom to choose. 'But let's keep some perspective.

"Former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has told the Royal Commission into Trade Union Corruption of her anger at arriving home from holidays to find her bathroom had been demolished by her then boyfriend Bruce Wilson. During four hours of testimony, Ms Gillard denied having any knowledge of an illegal 'slush fund' and having any role in setting up the account for the Australian Workers Union (AWU) Workplace Reform Association. Ms Gillard was answering questions about the fund, the purchase and renovations of an Abbotsford property she owned in the 1990s, as well as the relationship she shared with Mr Wilson, an AWU official. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard has denied knowledge of an illegal slush fund from the 1990s before the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption on Wednesday . Ms Gillard said she had no knowledge of the Australian Workers Union Workplace Reform Association fund until recent years and denied having any involvement in setting up their account . Counsel assisting, Jeremy Stoljar, SC, put to the woman who once held the highest office in the land, that she had been 'answering questions about these issues for many years, correct?"" 'I most certainly have, Mr Stoljar,' she replied - only this time the grilling was under oath and not in the court of public opinion. Mr Stoljar then homed in on how renovations at her property were paid for he, asking Ms Gillard 'were you annoyed that Mr Wilson had smashed up your bathroom?' She replied 'it wasn’t my preference, no' Mr Stoljar put to the ex-PM that it was likely that Mr Wilson had paid tradesmen working on her home in cash, without her knowledge. Ms Gillard refuted his claim. 'At the time of all of this, in 1995, I took steps to satisfy myself that looking at the amount of work that had been performed on my home, that I had paid for it all. That I had documents, receipts, invoices, that showed that I’d paid for it all,' she said, noting that it was a very stressful time in her life. 'I am sure that in our big wide world that there are tradespeople who take cash and don't issue receipts, it was my practice to pay by cheque.' Former PM Julia Gillard leaves the Royal Commission. Earlier she told counsel assisting that she might have done some things differently but 'none of us get to go in a time machine and go backwards. Obviously, if one got to do the whole thing again, you would do things differently given what I know now that I did not know at the time' The former PM tendered four short separate statements ahead of proceedings. Her lengthy evidence was punctuated by some jolting exchanges with counsel assisting. When pressed by Mr Stoljar on whether she felt there was an issue with an the Workplace Reform Association (WRA) seeking incorporation under the Australian Workers Union (AWU) banner, Ms Gillard replied: 'None of us get to go in a time machine and go backwards. Obviously, if one got to do the whole thing again, you would do things differently given what I know now that I did not know at the time.' The ex-PM admitted to providing legal advice regarding the establishment of WRA and assisting with the incorporation of the association, as well as providing free work. 'I provided legal advice, I then had no further contact with the work of the association or its workings.' She defended her decision to provide free legal work for Mr Wilson, when providing advice and assisting with the incorporation of the Workplace Reform Association. The entity was allegedly used as a union slush fund in the early 1990s. Ms Gillard did however concede, that in hindsight, she could have opened a file for the advice but did not agree it was a substantial task. 'Mr Stoljar, I can assure you that I did more substantial jobs than this for free for trade unions during my days at Slater and Gordon,' she said. 'Whilst this matter has come to assume a great deal of significance in the years since, at the time of these events and my provisions of advice, it had no particular significance. Ms Gillard (right) worked for law firm Slater and Gordon in the 1990s. 'I was just trying to do my best and give them the benefit of my professional expertise' she said of her work for WRA . 'In terms of a busy legal practice it did not stand out amongst the many matters on which I advised.' Ms Gillard has maintained she did not have an ongoing advisory role and when asked said there was no indication that the full name of the association, Australian Workers Union, Workplace Reform Association Inc., would mislead people or cause confusion. She also again denied having any knowledge of any WRA-related bank accounts, filling in forms or providing any detail for or writing an advertisement promoting the association in question. When pressed on whether she might have provided advise for the advertisement in question, Ms Gillard fired back at Mr Stoljar: 'I'm giving evidence in a Royal Commission, I'm not prepared to guess.' And she added: 'I was just trying to do my best and give them the benefit of my professional expertise.' At one point, Ms Gillard clearly became agitated with the line of questioning and dryly replied to a question regarding what her practice was in respect to dating a document. 'You put the right date on a document.' When pressed on whether she might have provided advise for the advertisement in question, Ms Gillard fired back at Mr Stoljar: 'I'm giving evidence in a Royal Commission, I'm not prepared to guess.' Ms Gillard often repeated that she was given no money by her former boyfriend, Mr Wilson, for the purchase of her house nor the renovations and despite their relationship, denied anything specific was discussed in relation to the setting up of the WRA account. She also detailed how in 1995 she took steps to satisfy that works on her property were paid for, and in a legitimate way. The ex-PM said she should have opened a file on the advice she gave to the unions but did not see it as necessary at the time . 'I worked hard... Mr Wilson worked hard... There would not have been times where we would have been sitting at my house while tradespeople were working,' she added. Throughout the commission she maintained she knew no specific details about the fund and she and Mr Wilson did not discuss the specifics while at home. Mr Stoljar asked: 'Did you ever wonder whether Mr Wilson had some other source of income?' Ms Gillard said: 'There was nothing about his conduct which caused me to wonder.' But when she questioned him on it further down the track, Ms Gillard said Mr Wilson was 'evasive' about the topic and she suspected he knew more than he had told her. This was during the time their relationship had already begun to break down. Ms Gillard has always denied allegations she knew that money from the fund was used to buy her house, and has publicly stated her belief that the fund was used for legitimate purposes. The commission is part of the investigation into the Australia Workers Union, and is specifically looking at the fund called the Workplace Reform Association (WRA). Ms Gillard, right with former treasurer Wayne Swan, has always denied any wrongdoing over the slush fund set up by her former boyfriend Bruce Wilson . Witnesses at the commission have previously testified Mr Wilson gave Ms Gillard money from the slush fund to pay for renovations to her house. In her statements presented to the Royal Commission, Ms Gillard said: 'I purchased 26 St Phillips Street, Abbotsford in May 1991. Over time, between 1993 and 1995, I had arious renovations done to the property. All payments made for renovations on my property were from my own money which was either derived from a loan from the bank and my salary.' 'Bruce Wilson was not paying for the renovations at St Phillips Street. 'To my knowledge, I never received monies that came from an account operated by (Bruce) Wilson and (Ralph) Blewitt.' Earlier, a key witness in Robert Elliott, a former Heath Services Union industrial officer and national secretary issued a public apology to the former PM, in recanting parts of his written testimony. Mr Elliott, described as a 'hostile witness' by the Commissioner, said he was embarrassed by his 'false memory'. He stated to Neil Clelland, SC, representing Ms Gillard that he was suffering ""acute embarrassment' and wanted to express 'my apologies to your client for causing her any distress and discomfort, that would be mortifying to me and I am very apologetic that it has made its way into the public domain.' Bruce Wilson fronted the commission earlier this year and said he had no conversations with Ms Gillard about the way the WRA funds would be used. On Tuesday, a former colleague of Ms Gillard's from Slater and Gordon Justice Bernard Murphy, told the commission despite hearing rumours in the mid-1990s about the slush fund he believed Ms Gillard was innocent. Justice Murphy - now a federal court judge - said he believed the rumours were started by the former prime minister's enemies.","Former PM Julia Gillard told how she came back from a holiday to find her boyfriend had demolished the bathroom in her home .

The last time Morph appeared on television screens was in 1997 but now, nearly two decades on, Aardman has resurrected the character thanks to an online campaign. Last year, Lord launched a fundraising project to produce new episodes featuring Morph on crowd-funding site Kickstarter. The initial target of £75,000 to fund 12 one-minute episodes was reached in just nine days. In January this year, the studio began production on 15 brand new episodes of Morph, including one where the character takes on the Ice Bucket Challenge. Sniff: Smiling widely, Morph waited with his hand outstretched in the park until a peckish squirrel approached . Peter Lord, the creator of Morph, poses with his plasticine star in Aardman Animination's studios in Bristol . Morph was first created in 1977 by Peter Lord and David Sproxton, and was named because he is always made out of a single lump of clay and can change shape . His first ever TV appearance was broadcast on BBC1 on February 15, 1977. He appeared in one minute 'shorts' interspersed throughout children's TV shows presented by Tony Hart. The character was known for living in a box, and was later joined by a white-coloured friend called Chas, allowing the two to interact. They often changed shape completely, and could be rolled, squished or bent into various shapes. While the original show was axed in 1997, there were several small Morph scenes created over following years before Mr Lord's recent Kickstarter campaign funded a whole new series.","Plasticine model Morph was posted in Bristol park by creator Peter Lord .

"A gay teen in South Dakota says he quit his job at fast-food chain Taco John's after a manager forced him to wear a name tag reading 'Gaytard' - and now he's looking into legal action. However, the Yanktown franchise's manager disputes 16-year-old Tyler Brandt's claims, saying he came up with the name-tag nickname himself. The alleged incident took place Monday night, when Brandt says his 'agitated' and 'verbally abusive' manager pulled him into the office and gave him the name tag with 'Gaytard' on it while laughing. Scroll down for video . That's not my name: 16-year-old Tyler Brandt says he was forced to wear this name tag at his fast-food job in Yanktown, South Dakota . Resignation: Brandt (left) says quit his job at Taco John's (right) the morning after his manager made him wear the name tag . Brandt had been struggling to learn the new job and was afraid to getting fired, so he agreed to wear the name tag. 'I put it on because I didn't want to upset him and I felt that if I did do anything to upset him, it would cause me to lose my job because he'd be looking for ways to fire me,' Brant told Keloland. He says he spent the night standing behind the till so customers wouldn't see the homophobic slur on his name tag, but Brandt says his manager continued to call him by the name across the store. Brandt tried taking off the tag several times, but his manager kept telling him to put it back on. Singled out: Brandt, pictured in photo posted to Facebook, says he's looking into suing the franchise for discrimination . By 11:30pm, Brandt was so frustrated that he asked how long was left in the shift, at which point the manager yelled and him and told him to 'Get the f*** out' of the restaurant. After talking about the situation with his boyfriend and other friends, Brandt decided to resign the next morning. He went into the restaurant to return his uniform but kept the name tag as evidence. However, restaurant manager John Scott says he didn't force Brandt to wear the name tag, and didn't come up with the nickname. 'He asked the manager to make that name tag for him,' Scott told the Press & Dakotan. 'He (the manager) didn't tell him he had to wear it. (Brandt) put it on himself and created the situation.' But Brandt says that idea is offensive. 'Do you really think I'd want to go around making a mockery of who I am?' It's really irritating to think someone could believe I would want that label.' Taco John's CEO Jeff Linville has since issued a statement, saying the company believes everyone 'should be treated with dignity and respect.' 'We take any accusation of workplace harassment very seriously. The type of discrimination that reportedly took place recently in the Yankton, South Dakota restaurant is deplorable. Such actions will not be tolerated by our company. Taco John’s is committed to doing all we can to make certain nothing like this happens again in any of our restaurants. Now both Scott and Brandt are exploring legal action against each other. 'I don't think that any person has to put up with what has been going on. I don't think that anybody should have to put up with any kind of discrimination. It's not fair,' Brandt said.","Tyler Brandt, 16, was training at the Yanktown, South Dakota franchise Monday night when the alleged incident happened .

"Killed: Gospel singer Roy Bray, 61, was killed when the RV he was driving came off the road in Indiana . The singer for an old-fashioned Southern gospel band died after the RV he was driving the band in crashed in the early hours of the morning. Roy Bray, a 61-year-old baritone with the Southmen Quartet, was driving the band back from a performance in Indiana when the vehicle came off the freeway and crashed into a tree yesterday morning. The RV was traveling south on I-65 in Lebanon, Indiana, when it hit a wooden median, 'totaling' the bus, a surviving member said. Bray, from Trenton, Kentucky, was pronounced dead at the scene. Another member, lead singer Jim Hefner, 72, was injured and taken to hospital. A statement from the local Sheriff's department said his injuries aren't life-threatening. The other members - Johny Washburn and Donnie Marr - escaped unharmed. The cause of the crash remains unclear. Marr described the incident in a post on his Facebook page. He wrote: 'As The Southmen Quartet was traveling to Nashville for our last concert for the weekend, tragedy hit us. Traveling down I65 south in Lebanon, IN, our bus left the road and traveled approximately 200 feet before hitting a tree head on totaling our bus. 'Our piano player/baritone singer Roy Bray was driving the bus and took the brunt of the impact and was tragically killed. Owner Jim Hefner has been admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Johny Washburn and myself walked away with few or no scratches. Onstage: Bray was a baritone singer and a pianist for the Southmen Quartet, with whom he was on tour . 'We ask each one of you to pray for the Southmen and families thru this difficult time and especially for Roy - our brother, partner, friend, father, and husband, and his sweet family!' The band played a concert at the Trinity United Methodist Church in Kentland, Indiana, Saturday night. They were scheduled to play at the Lavergne, Miracle Baptist Chuch in Lavergne, Tennessee, which would have been their 60th concert this year. The group was heading south after a performance in the northern Indiana town of Shipshewana. Performing: Bray is seen left singing alongside other members of the Southmen Quartet . Bray had been involved in gospel music since the 1960s, and toured around the country - and to Canada - with the Southmen Quartet. He described his 'mission in life' as 'to seek and save the lost'. Writing on the group's website in 2012, Bray said: 'I have been involved in southern gospel music in many ways since 1966, and I'd have to admit that I'm not easily impressed, but wow; what a time I've had traveling and performing with The Southmen!' 'I count it an honor and a blessing to work the type churches and venues in which The Southmen perform and, best of all we are seeing souls saved, lives changed and, Christians re-dedicating their lives to The Lord. What more could a gospel musician/singer ask for?' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Roy Bray, a 61, died near Lebanon, Indiana in a crash early Sunday morning .

"The ex-boyfriend of former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard has been verbally abused while walking down the street, after giving evidence at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. On Thursday, former union official Bruce Wilson denied ever giving Ms Gillard 'wads' of cash and accused fellow witnesses of lying. At the centre of the controversy are claims that Mr Wilson paid for renovations to Ms Gillard's house, when the two were in a romantic relationship in the early 1990s. 'I don't recall that I ever gave Gillard any money myself, or asked anyone to do so on my behalf': Bruce Wilson, the ex-boyfriend of former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, has denied ever giving slush fund money to the former PM and accused anyone that says anything different of lying . Former union official Bruce Wilson, who now works as a cook, made repeated denials to the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption on Thursday that he had paid for Ms Gillard's renovations when the two were in a relationship in the early 1990s. 'I don't recall that I ever gave Gillard any money myself, or asked anyone to do so on my behalf,' Mr Wilson said in a 91-page statement to the commission. 'During our relationship, Gillard was independent about everything, including financial matters.' Mr Wilson said tradesmen and former colleagues who gave evidence to the commission that he had handed over cash to Ms Gillard and requested money be placed into her account were wrong. Mr Wilson met Ms Gillard, then a lawyer with firm Slater and Gordon, in 1991 when she did work for the Australian Workers' Union in Perth. He was secretary of the AWU's Western Australia branch but moved to Victoria in 1992 and became secretary of the Victorian branch of the AWU after beginning a personal relationship with Ms Gillard. Former Wilson colleague, Wayne Hem, has told the commission he received a 'wad of notes' worth $5000 from the union boss and was told to place it into Ms Gillard's bank account. Mr Wilson said on Thursday he didn't recall having given Mr Hem the money. He denied evidence from builder Athol James, who previously told the commission that Ms Gillard had told him during the 1994 work on the Abbotsford, Melbourne property that Mr Wilson was paying the bills. And Mr Wilson also rejected evidence from his one-time right-hand-man, confessed bagman Ralph Blewitt, that he had tucked $7000 into the overalls pocket of a tradesman at Ms Gillard's house to pay for work. 'This never occurred' he said. Heckled on the street: Ex-union official and former boyfriend of Julia Gillard, Bruce Wilson, was heckled on the street after giving evidence at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption . Counsel assisting the commission, Jeremy Stoljar SC challenged Mr Wilson's version of events, saying: 'There seem to be a long list of people, according to you, who are not telling the truth'. At the heart of the AWU affair is a so-called 'slush fund', the Workplace Reform Association, established by Mr Wilson in 1992 with legal advice from Ms Gillard. The commission has heard funds of about $2000 a week flowed into the WRA from construction firm Thiess to pay for supposed safety training, although no work was ever done. Some funds were used in buying a house in Melbourne, with Ms Gillard attending the auction with Mr Wilson after discussing how to arrange a power-of-attorney at a Thai dinner with Mr Wilson and Mr Blewitt. Mr Wilson said he wanted to conceal the purchase of the house from the AWU but did not tell this to Ms Gillard. The commission will begin investigating the Health Services Union on Monday.

"A village school which has six members of staff on its payroll despite having no pupils has been branded a 'fiasco'. All the children have now left the small, rural Ravenstonedale Endowed School in Cumbria following an 'inadequate' Ofsted inspection in April yet a cook, two teaching assistants, a cleaner and a secretary – all being paid a full-salary – join the headmistress Vicki Boggon every day. Andy Silvester of the Tax Payers' Alliance called the situation a 'complete fiasco' and said that taxpayers would be 'baffled'. Ravenstonedale Endowed School in Cumbria has no pupils but six members of staff . He added: 'It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that a school without pupils doesn't need any staff. 'The process of closing the school, and reassigning these staff to places where they can actually contribute to a child's education, must be sped up.' Adding to the odd situation, Cumbria County Council, who took over the running of Ravenstonedale, have suggested in a 'consultation on closure' document, that that the school may stay open for another seven months. Trouble started at the small school near Kirkby Steven, Cumbria, when it was put under 'special measures' after inspectors who arrived on April 30 at half a day's notice found 'there are too many incidents of racist and homophobic bullying, together with some serious instances of violence towards one another'. Cumbria County Council, who took over the running of Ravenstonedale, have suggested in a 'consultation on closure' document, that that the school may stay open for another seven months . The news shocked and confused the quiet community because there were only 13 pupils at the school and they were all white. But  the chairman of governors at Ravenstonedale, has claimed the report was based on a single incident of children using the word 'gay' as a throwaway comment and not knowing what it meant. She said she believed that Ofsted had an agenda against small schools and suspected they'd been unfairly labelled racist because racism and homophobia were treated as one category by Ofsted. Since the damning report every one of the pupils enrolled has now been taken out of the school. By September there were just two pupils left, and within the past month that number has dwindled to zero. Parents of children at Ravenstonedale Endowed School have described the Ofsted report as 'ludicrous' A Cumbria County Council spokesman said: 'Despite a positive recent Ofsted monitoring visit, unfortunately the school now has no pupils attending. 'As a result the council will begin a consultation on the future of the school from October 27 which runs until 21 November. 'We're exploring options with staff about how we might be able to deploy them to other schools when close-down procedures have been completed. 'In doing this, we have to follow Human Resources law and their employment rights by consulting with staff and working with them to look at what their options might be.' Ravenstonedale is centred on a single main street, though there are many scattered dwellings on the periphery. There are two pubs in the village . Although the school has no pupils, there are still people in the area who would prefer it to stay open. Paul Bonsall, the 63-year-old owner of the Fat Lamb Hotel, Ravenstonedale is one of them although he chose to send his children, now in their thirties, to a different school. He said: 'It would be a real shame if the school ceased to exist completely as it was once at the very centre of village life. 'However I agree that they shouldn't be paying all six members of staff to keep it open. 'It probably only needs the headmistress to complete whatever tasks still need to be dealt with even without any pupils.'","School put under special measures after Ofsted observed 'racist and homophobic behaviour'

"For those who suffer from hayfever, the onset of autumn may usually be a great relief. But British scientists fear the season of sneezing and snuffling may be extended, after they found the first signs of pollen from invasive foreign plants. Common ragweed - a highly allergenic plant which emits a billion pollen grains in a single season - is already the biggest cause of hayfever in the US. It invaded the Eurppean mainland in the 1960s - brought over in contaminated seed - and has been spreading north ever since. Common ragweed is already the biggest cause of hayfever in the America and now the pollen in being found in England . Usually the plant, which grows in late summer and early autumn, would not cope with our chilly September weather. But scientists think it has managed to establish itself in the UK thanks to our long and warm summer. Researchers at the University of Leicester, who have been monitoring pollen levels for 40 years, found signs of ragweed pollen on four consecutive days earlier this month. On one of the days the ragweed pollen count at their East Midlands recording site reached 38 - a level high enough to cause significant hayfever attacks and problems for asthmatics. One in five British people suffer from hayfever - and another one in 12 have asthma. Because ragweed is so allergenic - far more than grass - it could become a real health problem if it becomes established. It would also extend the hayfever season, which currently ends for most people by early August. Experts last night warned asthmatics to make sure they have their inhalers with them at all times, given the increased risk. Deborah Waddell, lead clinical advisor at Asthma UK, said: ‘The milder weather and presence of ragweed pollen may now result in a longer pollen season this year which will cause misery for people with asthma and hay fever in the UK. ‘The 79 per cent of people with asthma who find that pollen makes their symptoms worse may also be at an increased risk of a potentially life threatening asthma attack.’ Microbiologist Dr Catherine Pashley, who led the research in Leicester, said the plant - which grows up to three feet in height - had probably come into Britain in birdseed imported from Europe or the US. She said isolated cases of ragweed had been reported before in Britain, particularly on the south coast - but they had never become established and had never created a pollen problem before. But because of the mild autumn, she fears ragweed may have enough time to grow sufficiently to survive the winter - and may be a real problem next year. She said: ‘Ragweed can’t survive [here] because of our cooler climate compared to North America and Central Europe, so we were very surprised to see it when we analysed the pollen and fungi in the air earlier this month. ‘Whether or not we continue to see more ragweed will very much depend on how mild this autumn is and when we have the first frost. If it is a late frost, it is likely that ragweed levels may increase this time next year. One in five British people suffer from hayfever - and another one in 12 have asthma . ‘Pollen counts change on a daily basis and seasonally. It is really important to monitor pollen levels in the air to inform treatment for the millions of hayfever and asthma sufferers in the country. It can also be used as an indicator of climate change.’ Dr Jonathan Storkey, a plant biologist at the Rothamsted Research centre in Hertfordshire, said controls on bird seed are far from rigorous. When contaminated seed is put out in bird feeders in the garden, some may drop out and germinate in the soil below. ‘This is mainly a problem of sunflower seed imports,’ he said. ‘This grows as a weed among sunflowers in the US - and controls on bird seed are far less stringent than for plant seed. ‘This has certainly been the year for ragweed to establish itself, if that is what it has done - this late summer spell of good weather is perfect for it. ‘However, this could be a case of airborne pollen coming over from France. It has been spreading through central and northern France for some time - the right wind and some settled weather could explain why it is being picked up in the Midlands.’ Dr Richard Gornall, director of the Leicester Botanic Garden, said there is a chance the seeds could have been carried to the UK by birds. ‘The ragweed fruit - which encases the seed - has wings and spines that can become attached to animals and birds. ‘That is the most probable cause. But whatever had caused this, it is very unusual to see this level of ragweed pollen. ‘The source is clearly local to the East Midlands - these levels suggest a number of plants have become established in the recent past.’","Common ragweed is already the biggest cause of hayfever in the US .

"After a few nights staying in a hotel, eating out every night or paying extortionate prices for room service can become tiresome. And sometimes, you just want to whip up an easy dinner yourself. George Egg, a frequent hotel guest around the world, discovered that it is possible to cook a three-course meal using just the objects found inside a standard budget hotel room. The British comedian has used a trouser press, iron, hairdryer, waste bin, electric towel rail and kettle as cooking tools for his in-room dining. Scroll down for video . In-room dining: George Egg has made a name for himself by creating three-course meals in his hotel rooms . George, 41, has made everything from pancakes and fish to ice cream and tiramisu over the years. 'I've been performing on the stand-up circuit for the last 20 years,' he said. 'I'm really into cooking but often I stay in soulless budget hotels where they serve over-priced and not very good food. 'I would rather cook my own, so I started experimenting and seeing what I could rustle up in my room. There are various ways of heating and cooking things, using just the stuff you find in there. 'I started out doing pretty basic dishes. Now I can do quite advanced stuff, like making ice cream.' Resourceful: The comedian uses just the equipment found inside a budget hotel room to make his food - like toasting muffins on an iron . Five years ago, George made short films of hotel room cookery demos as he travelled the world - and they went viral on YouTube. Now, he's taking his unique brand of cooking show on the road in a UK tour. 'It's an hour of stand-up and storytelling about my exploits, while I simultaneously make a starter, a main and a dessert,' he said. 'The food is actually very good and the audience are welcome to eat the dishes, though I always stress it's ""at your own risk"". 'I have made pancakes, poached fish and ricotta out of those little cartons of UHT milk. Hotel-cooked meal: George has made pancakes, ice cream, tiramisu, fish and pastas . 'I have found two ways to make ice-cream. One that doesn't work, I discovered, involves a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher. The other, which does work, involves the nifty use of the ice machine in the corridors of hotels. 'You can use a heated towel rail to make beef jerky, by drying strips of brined meat on it. 'Hotel kettles are tiny but you can poach a sea bass if you cut it into four fillets. I add fennel seeds, too, and make a nice salsa verde. 'I think ""This would cost me £18 in the restaurant downstairs, and I've done it in my room without a kitchen"".' Clever: In this YouTube video, the 41-year-old made pasta by boiling it in the hotel room kettle . George is playing The Victoria, Birmingham, on October 5, where he will perform his cookery show. He said: 'I like playing Birmingham.. I grew up in London and live in Brighton now, but my parents met while at teacher training college in Birmingham. 'And, of course, with my name I'm a fan of Mr Egg the greasy spoon. 'On stage with me in Anarchist Cook I have an iron, kettle, minibar and trouser press, plus towels and sachets of sugar and milk. Unique show: George is now taking his skills on the road in a one-man show, Anarchist Cook, at The Victoria in Birmingham . 'With a kettle you can steam, poach and boil; with an iron you can fry and toast. 'I'm particularly proud of the ice-cream invention. I've even made a tiramisu using only the free ingredients provided by the hotel, including milk, biscuits, sugar and coffee.

"The Bank of England has come under fire for lavishing staff with pensions ‘beyond the wildest dreams’ of ordinary people. In a withering attack, government adviser Ros Altmann has described the benefits paid to employees at Threadneedle Street as ‘mind boggling’ and the most generous she has seen in the UK. Last night another pensions expert said the gold plated pensions enjoyed by Bank officials are more befitting of an ‘international superstar chief executive.’ The old lady of Threadneedle Street:  Government adviser Ros Altmann has described the benefits paid to employees at the Bank of England as ‘mind boggling’ and the most generous she has seen in the UK . More than 1,000 Bank staff are still building up benefits in a gold plated final salary pension which pays out a retirement income based on salary at retirement and length of service. The same applies for a slightly less generous ‘career average’ pension introduced in 2007 for new employees, which has around 1,400 ‘active members’. But staff in either scheme do not have to contribute a penny for the privilege. Instead the Bank makes an annual contribution of more than half of their salary. Even MPs - who also enjoy hugely generous final salary pensions - typically contribute just under 14pc of their salary. Latest figures published by the Bank show it also increased contributions from under £50million last year to almost £75million this year to plug a growing funding deficit in its pensions. Dr Altmann, who has been appointed by the Government to champion the rights of older workers, said: ‘These benefits are beyond the wildest dreams of ordinary savers. ‘It means staff on £50,000 are actually being paid £75,000 – they don’t have to contribute a penny. ‘I can’t think of any other schemes in the UK which are as generous as this.’ 'Benefits are beyond the wildest dreams of ordinary savers': Dr Altmann, left, has been appointed by the Government to champion the rights of older workers. The bank's '£1million' governor, Mark Carney, is right . The vast majority of private sector employers have shut down their final salary pension schemes because they are too expensive to run - partly because people are living longer. Just 1.8million private sector workers are still paying into a final salary pension scheme – a drop of around half since 2006, according to the latest figures from the Pension Protection Fund. Oil giant Shell in 2012 became the last blue chip company in the UK to shut its final salary pension to new joiners. Almost a third of final salary schemes in the private sector have been closed to future contributions for existing members. Meanwhile the gulf between public sector and private sector workers is growing, with around 12 million public sector workers still enjoying a generous final salary pension funded by taxpayers. Millions of private sector workers are being automatically enrolled into work pensions as part of a government-backed scheme to kick-start saving in the UK and avert a future crisis. Referring to the Bank of England’s pension arrangements, Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Landsown, said: ‘These benefits are off the scale and are more generous than the best mainstream public sector schemes. ‘You are getting into international superstar chief executive territory here.’ Although the Bank of England’s pension is not funded by taxpayers, this is not the first time its generous benefits have come under the spotlight. Earlier this year it emerged Mark Carney had become the first £1million governor, with his move from Canada to London costing the Bank of England nearly £200,000, on top of his £874,000 annual package. This includes a £250,000 annual housing allowance. Mr Carney is not a member of the Bank’s final salary pension scheme and receives a payment of around £145,000 - 30pc of his £480,000 salary - instead. The Bank of England declined to comment.","Ros Altmann says Bank's pensions are the most generous she has seen .

"U.S. stocks drifted lower in afternoon trading on Friday, as the market headed for a lower close for the week. A slide in semiconductor stocks weighed on the Nasdaq composite index. U.S. financial markets were mixed in midday trading on Friday, on track to end lower for the week on the heels of a wild two-day market swing. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 38 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,697 as of 12.19pm (ET). U.S. stocks drifted lower in afternoon trading on Friday, as the market headed for a lower close for the week . U.S. financial markets were mixed in midday trading on Friday (pictured) following the market's worst day of 2014 on Thursday . Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. After suffering its biggest points loss in 2014 yesterday, the Dow was up slightly in this morning . The Standard & Poor's 500 index was down less than one point to 1,927. The Nasdaq composite lost 33 points, or 0.8 percent, to 4,344. The market had a pessimistic start on Friday morning following its worst day of 2014. U.S. stock futures dropped today suggesting the effect of a 334-point plunge on the Dow Jones industrial average on Thursday was hitting hard. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 63 points, or 0.4 per cent, according to The Wall Street Journal - before today's trading began. The dramatic decline on Thursday came after a slump in energy stocks and worries about the global economy sent investors fleeing out of the market. It was the biggest point drop since June 2013. It was also the third straight day investors have been taken on a wild roller coaster ride. On Tuesday, the Dow fell 272 points, only to jump 275 points on Wednesday. While 100-plus moves in the Dow have become more common as stocks have risen to record highs, 200-plus point moves had been rare until this week. More than half of this year's 200-point moves have happened in the last two weeks. It was a roller coaster week (five-day chart pictured) on the Dow Jones with pessimism setting in among investors on Friday before the opening bell . Pictured, the Dow Jones industrial average at the end of trading on Thursday. The Dow was up on Wednesday but plummeted on Thursday after a slump in energy stocks . The VIX, a measure of volatility that is sometimes called Wall Street's 'fear index,' jumped 26 percent to its highest level since February. 'The violent gyrations are causing havoc for fund managers and active investors (who were) hoping for a smooth fourth quarter,' said Todd Schoenberger of J. Streicher Asset Management. After more than three years of the stock market moving quietly, steadily higher, volatility is back and in a big way, market observers say. The stock market hasn't seen day-to-day movements like this since August 2011, when Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States' credit rating. The S&P downgrade subsequently pushed the U.S. stock market into its last 'correction,' a technical term for when stocks fall 10 percent or more from a recent peak. Stocks fell at the opening of trading on Thursday, and the selling accelerated once European markets closed at midday Eastern time. By the end of the day, the Dow had lost 334.97 points, or 2 percent, to 16,659.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 40.68 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,928.21 and the Nasdaq composite fell 90.26 points, or 2 percent, to 4,378.34. The FTSE 100 Index has continued its slump as fears about the state of the powerhouse German economy lead to a big correction for global stocks. Leading European markets were down by as much 2%, with the Dax in Frankfurt extending its losses for the week to more than 5% and the FTSE 100 Index testing a new one-year low with a fall of more than 100 points. Worries about the global economy, particularly in Europe and Asia, have been accompanied by a wave of selling in energy and commodity stocks due to a recent sharp fall in the price of oil. Fears that Europe's largest economy, Germany, may fall into recession were fuelled yesterday when a report showed its exports sank 5.8% in August, the biggest monthly drop in five years. It triggered Wall Street's worst session of the year last night, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by nearly 2%. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its growth forecasts for the three largest eurozone economies - Germany, France and Italy. The FTSE 100 Index has now retreated from near-record territory less than a month ago to its lowest level since October last year. The spread of the deadly Ebola virus has also had an impact on travel stocks, including British Airways owner International Airlines Group. Few companies were spared from the selling on Thursday. All 30 members of the blue chip Dow index fell and 482 of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 index ended the day lower. Worries about the global economy, particularly in Europe and Asia, were once again center stage. A large part of Thursday's selling happened in energy stocks, particularly oil and coal companies. The price of oil fell sharply again Thursday, continuing its multi-week decline, on concerns that global oil production remains high despite signs that global demand is slowing. A report showed Germany exports sank 5.8 percent in August, the biggest monthly drop in five years. The figure raises concerns that Europe's largest economy may fall into recession. Earlier in the week, the IMF cut its outlook for this year and next for the global economy, citing weakness in Japan, Latin America and particularly Europe. 'Europe is struggling. Asia is struggling. Japan is struggling. The United States is the best house on the block at the moment,' said Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments. Benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.54 to $85.77 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a third straight decline of more than 1.5 percent. Oil is now 20 percent below its 2014 peak of $107.26 a barrel, reached in late June, technically pushing oil into a bear market. Brent crude, an international benchmark used to price oil used by many U.S. refineries, fell $1.33 to $90.05 a barrel in London, at one point slipping below $90 for the first time since June 2012. Sinking crude price mean lower future profits for oil and gas companies, and investors responded accordingly. The energy sector of the S&P 500 fell nearly 4 percent, far more than the rest of the market. Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the nation's two largest oil and gas companies, each fell roughly 3 percent. Coal stocks also took a beating after Morgan Stanley analysts downgraded the entire industry. Walter Energy slumped 11 percent and Peabody Energy fell 9 percent. Traders say the market's volatility may ease once corporate earnings season gets fully underway. Aluminum company Alcoa reported its results Wednesday, which beat analysts' expectations, but the bulk of S&P 500 companies will not report for another week or so. 'Everyone seems to be waiting for earnings season at this point,' said Neil Massa, senior equity trader at John Hancock Asset Management. Average investors who might be worried about the market's recent volatility should remain calm, Fidelity's Timmer said. The stock market has gone up for three straight years and the S&P 500 index is still up 4.3 percent this year. 'Just stick to your long-term (retirement) plan,' Timmer said. 'You don't want to sell at the bottom and buy at the top.' In other company news, Gap dropped $5.23, or 13 percent, to $36.67. The clothing chain's CEO Glenn Murphy announced he would step down in February. The news came as a surprise to investors, since Murphy is only 52 and was expected to continue in his role for several more years. Murphy was credited for helping Gap navigate through the Great Recession and restoring the company's appeal to younger customers. Advanced Micro Devices, better known as AMD, fell 33 cents, or 10 percent, to $2.95. The chipmaker also announced a change in leadership, saying CEO and president Rory Read was stepping down. AMD has long struggled to keep its market share of the PC chip market against its main competitor Intel. The dollar fell to 107.92 yen and the euro fell to $1.2687. U.S. government bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held at 2.33 percent. Wholesale gasoline futures fell 4.35 cents to $2.275 a gallon. The average price at the pump across the U.S. is $3.25, down 18 cents from a month ago. In other trading of energy futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, heating oil fell 3.9 cents to $2.537 a gallon and natural gas slipped 1 cent to $3.845 per 1,000 cubic feet. With this week's volatility, investors moved into gold. The price of gold rose $19.30 to $1,225.30 an ounce. Silver rose 35 cents to $17.42 an ounce and copper rose three cents to $3.03 a pound.","U.S. stock futures dropped today before the opening bell following a 334-point plunge on the Dow on Thursday .

"French truckers are threatening to blockade the port of Calais in protest at steep fines imposed for British-bound migrants found hiding in their lorries. Haulage firms are fined £2,000 for each illegal immigrant they bring across the Channel from France. Drivers complain that lax border controls in Calais allow stowaways to climb into their vehicles and sneak into Britain. Penalty protest: French truckers could be set to copy British counterparts who organised a demonstration in Dover a week ago, above, claiming they were being wrongly punished for a lack of proper border controls . And the harsh penalties imposed if they are caught is driving some firms to bankruptcy. Hundreds of truckers staged a mass protest in Dover a week ago claiming they were being unfairly punished for the lack of proper checks across the Channel. David Sagnard, president of France's National Road Haulage Federation, said: 'We have reached the point of no return. 'Many firms can not afford these hefty fines if they are caught in Britain, and some are going bust. 'If those in charge do not act now to resolve this issue, we plan a blockade.' Lorry drivers are now forbidden from parking overnight within 100 miles of Calais in case immigrants sneak aboard. But many climb into lorries at service stations near the port, or break into the secure truck parking area at the ferry terminal. Truckers and their supporters gathered in Dover last week to complain about the financial penalties imposed on hauliers who are found with illegal migrants in their vehicles . Two weeks ago, Home Secretary Theresa May promised to give France £12 million to tighten security in Calais after 250 illegal immigrants stormed the ferry terminal hoping to make it across the Channel. The UK also offered Calais an 11-mile-long high security fence used at a NATO summit in Wales to keep the migrants out of the ferry terminal. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart also recently threatened to blockade the ferry port unless Britain did more to help her town tackle the crisis. Ms Bouchart also wants the UK border to be moved from Calais to Britain, and for Prime Minister David Cameron to visit her town. She recently blamed the UK's 'generous' state benefits for refugees for the squalid migrant camps in her town. She said: 'Calais is a hostage to the British. That's enough. It's no longer tenable. It's necessary to renegotiate these accords. We're not here to do their job.' There are an estimated 2,000 migrants in Calais, where tensions have been mounting in recent months as hundreds more refugees fleeing war zones in the Middle East and poverty in Africa flood into the town. Mass brawls between rival gangs have left more than 70 people injured during July and August. Many refugees are now taking increasingly dangerous risks to sneak into the UK. Last month two migrants were plucked to safety from the English Channel after trying to climb aboard a moving ferry off Calais. Migrants have also risked their lives by smuggling themselves into refrigerated lorries, clinging to the axles of HGVs and even aboard a cargo of coffins.","Firms fined £2,000 for each illegal immigrant they bring across the Channel .

"A 90-year-old woman who shattered her pelvis in a fall was forced to wait six hours for an ambulance to take her to hospital. Barbara Hedley, who lives alone, was found lying face down by her neighbour crying in agony. After the alarm was raised at 5.45pm on August 29, guidelines stipulate an ambulance should have taken Mrs Hedley to hospital within 90 minutes. But the widow, who said she feels she was treated like a 'dog', did not arrive at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital until after midnight. Scroll down for video . Barbara Hedley, 90, from Beeston Regis, near Sheringham in north Norfolk, was left in agony waiting for an ambulance for six hours after falling at her home and shattering her pelvis . Mrs Hedley, of Beeston Regis, near Sheringham in north Norfolk, said: 'I took a very dim view of all this having been in the trade for many years and to be treated like I wished I was dead. 'I don't think you would have treated a dog like that.' The former ward sister at Mundesley Hospital, Norfolk, added: 'I have never suffered so much pain in my life. 'I will never forget it.' Her neighbour Gina Mackenzie, 68, rushed to help after the 90-year-old pressed an emergency help-line button. But it was more than two hours before a rapid response paramedic arrived and more than six before Mrs Hedley was taken to ambulance by a crew. Mrs Mackenzie said she repeatedly called to find out if an ambulance had been sent. A paramedic finally turned up after 8pm in a rapid response vehicle. 'The paramedic told us that if an ambulance had not arrived by 11pm we should phone 999,' said Mrs Mackenzie. But with no ambulance she rang again at 11.15pm. 'Again it was confirmed that an ambulance was on its way coming from a very long way away but without blue lights,' said Mrs Mackenzie. It was 12.15am before an ambulance arrived, by which time Mrs Hedley had been lifted into her bed. Mrs Hedley added: 'I never want to go through that again. 'I couldn't move because of the pain in my leg and I knew I had fractured it.' The former nurse said she feels she was treated like a 'dog'. She said: 'I never want to go through that again. I couldn't move because of the pain in my leg' Norwich-born Mrs Hedley trained at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital before starting her career as a nurse in 1948. She moved into her current home in 1980, her husband Walter died four years later and she has lived by herself ever since. 'One of the biggest fears I have is falling over,' said Mrs Hedley. An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said Mrs Hedley had been conscious and breathing so the incident was graded as a 'green call' as it was not life-threatening. Di Chan, senior locality manager for the ambulance service, said: 'I'd like to apologise to the patient for waiting as long as she did to be taken to hospital. 'A paramedic attended her two hours after the call but an ambulance crew was not available to visit her until much later. 'I am heartened that she was pleased with the level of care given when we attended. 'We are looking at this patient's case and will visit her to discuss what happened. 'We're working hard to get more ambulances on the road, recruit hundreds of new frontline staff, upskill staff, and save money to reinvest and improve patient care so that patients get a quicker response and a level of service they expect.' Health Minister and North Norfolk MP Norman Lamb said: 'The impression I get is there has been a reduction in the horror stories, but this case demonstrates there is still a long way to go. 'There are still failings, which are unacceptable and I think renewing the ambulance fleet and recruiting hundreds of student paramedics will bear fruit. 'But it will take time.' Between April and August this year, there were 164 instances in north Norfolk where response times to non-life-threatening patients were breached. This was just under 4 per cent of all calls. Ambulance services across the UK categorise each call according to how serious the patient's condition is. The aim is to ensure the most serious, life-threatening calls are dealt with first. The categories are nationally agreed, by the Department of Health and each ambulance service across the UK are measured according to required targets. - Red 1 . The most serious category, Red 1 is reserved for those patients who have suffered traumatic life-threatening injuries or those who are displaying the signs of suffering a heart attack or cardiac arrest. An ambulance is expected to reach a patient within eight minutes. Where possible two ambulance crews are dispatched to Red 1 calls - commonly a rapid response car, who can make initial assessments and start to treat the patient at the scene, followed by an ambulance, who can transport the patient to hospital. Ambulance services across the UK categorise each 999 call according to how serious the patient's condition is. The aim is to ensure the most life-threatening calls are dealt with first . - Red 2 . The second most serious category is for all other life-threatening emergencies. Examples include patients who have suffered a stroke, with serious symptoms or those who are struggling to breathe. Similarly to Red 1 ambulance crews are expected to reach the patient within eight minutes of the 999 call being logged. For both Red calls the response times are set out as national requirements rather than recommended times. The guidelines dictate that an emergency response - usually in the form of a rapid response car - will reach 75 per cent of these calls within eight minutes. Where onward transport to hospital is required, 95 per cent of life-threatening calls will receive an ambulance capable of transporting the patient within 19 minutes of the request being made. - Green 1 . These are serious but not life-threatening calls, for example diabetic problems or a suspected stroke with no serious symptoms. A Green 1 call requires an emergency response within 20 minutes. - Green 2 . Also deemed serious but not life-threatening, Green 2 calls can include suspected fractured arms or legs, or a patient who has fallen and maybe immobile. These calls require an emergency crew to be on the scene within 30 minutes. - Green 3 . These are non-emergency calls which require an on-scene response within 60 minutes or an assessment over the phone from the clinical support desk within 20 minutes. A patient who has suffered a suspected overdose, but is showing no serious symptoms, or someone who has suffered a non serious injury would be classified as a Green 3 call. - Green 4 . These are the least serious calls, which require emergency crews to be sent to the scene within 90 minutes or a telephone assessment within an hour. Minor scalding, a fall with no apparent injuries or someone in pain, but showing no serious symptoms would be classed as a Green 4 999 call. Response times for Green calls are recommended and are set locally rather than being national requirements.","Barbara Hedley fell and shattered her pelvis at home on August 29 .

"Fashion designer Julien Macdonald, who once called plus-size models  ‘a joke’, is eating his words. After losing more than a stone on Strictly Come Dancing last year, he’s now trying to bulk up. Julien’s been topping up his diet  with NRG Fuel protein shakes and supplements, while cycling daily  and going to the gym three times a week. He is attempting to gain more muscle ahead of a 280-mile charity  bike ride next month. Working hard: Designer Julien Macdonald lost more than a stone on Strictly Come Dancing but is now bulking up ahead for a 280-mile charity bike ride . ‘I’ve committed to doing this marathon ride through Madagascar  in aid of ENABLE Scotland,’ says Julien.‘This is a huge physical challenge, so I need to prepare.’ On Britain’s Next Top Model, where he was Mr Nasty on the judging panel, Julien famously said that ‘if you’re a size 14 in a room full of size 8s, you’re in the wrong room’. He later apologised, saying there was a gap in the market for curvier models. Maybe he’ll discover there’s a market for more flattering cycle clothing, too. Sneaky: More than a quarter of people hide how much they use their phone from their partner . For those who queued round  the block to buy Apple’s new iPhone 6, take heed – new research has discovered that smartphone addiction is causing romantic strife. A survey of 1,000 people, commissioned by musicMagpie, found that 41 per cent of couples bicker about the amount of time spent on their mobile phones. As a result, more than a quarter of people hide how much they use their phone from their partner. Psychotherapist Toni Mackenzie said: ‘Over recent years, mobile telephones have become psychologically addictive for  many users. ‘They can lead to people switching off from reality and missing out on what’s actually going on around them.’ A remarkable new serum has been found to start the healing process in cold sores within two days. Herpatch Serum, which includes an ingredient derived from red algae, forms a thin transparent layer over the sore to protect it, preventing further infection and accelerating the healing process, claim the makers, Belgian skincare company Sylphar. Without any treatment, cold sores – which are highly contagious and caused by the herpes simplex virus – will take about ten days to clear up. The Herpatch Serum  is available from Boots at £7.99.

"For most, cosmetics are a big part of their daily routine, especially women. Few other consumer products are directly applied to our bodies in the way cosmetics are, so it's a wonder, how safe are they really? Well not as safe as some might think with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission finding that cosmetics actually accounted for around 30 per cent of injury reports in the past year. Thousands of Australians every year are being injured from wrongly labelled products, with some consumers succumbing to severe allergic reactions. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has found that cosmetics actually accounted for around 30 per cent of injury reports in the past year . Skin infections and irritations like these (pictured) can be caused from makeup. It's been found by the ACCC that thousands of Australians every year are being injured from wrongly labelled products, with some consumers succumbing to severe allergic reactions . 'We see skin infections, bacterial conjunctivitis, folliculitis, corneal ulcers and anaphylactic shocks, which is why ingredients labelling is very important indeed,' deputy chair of the ACCC Delia Rickard told the Canberra Times. The ACCC receives mandatory injury reports when a supplier becomes aware that a product has or may have caused death, serious injury or illness. The consumer watchdog also does regular surveys on cosmetic products and is, this year focusing on products which have no ingredient labelling and where ingredient labelling is in a language other than English. It says the cosmetic labelling standard helps consumers identify ingredients that they may be allergic or sensitive to. 'People who make and supply cosmetic products need to be fully aware of their responsibilities,' said Ms Rickard. 'An inaccurate list of ingredients, or a product without a label could see consumers with allergies exposed to harm.' 'Where we identify non-compliance with the cosmetics labelling standard, we will speak with the suppliers and enforcement action will be seriously contemplated.' The ACCC does regular surveys on cosmetic products and is, this year, focusing on products which have no ingredient labelling and where ingredient labelling is in a language other than English . During 2012-13, the ACCC started an audit of cosmetic-related injury reports received during 2011. The main observations from that, were many of the reports involved injuries from face washes, creams, body wash products and creams and deodorants. It also found that while labelling was generally good, some products had ingredient labelling that was inconsistent. This woman in her 20s had had an allergic reaction. Around 30 per cent of injuries are linked to cosmetics in the past year . In mid-2013 the ACCC also investigated whether microbiological contamination may be to blame for some of the reported injuries. A survey of products sold in Australia saw three out of 112 products tested returned high microbial counts. The Canberra Times reported, lab tests of products found Nude by Nature Liquid Mineral Foundation, Australian Lavender Essentials Eye Cream and Australian Lavender Essentials Face Up Moisturiser had dangerous levels of microbial contamination, leading to their recall. 'It is a timely reminder as the trend to produce all natural and all organic products may increase pressure on manufacturers to produce cosmetics with less preservatives or less effective natural preservatives,' said Ms Rickard. This year, The ACCC conducted a specialised survey on popular deodorants. It came after a consumer made a complaint about an allergy to one particular deodorant ingredient. It was found that ingredient labels on some deodorants were not prominent or legible as they were required to be. Talking at the Accord Cosmetic and Personal Care conference in Sydney this week, Ms Rickard said all consumers needed to be assured that every manufacturer, importer or retailer in Australia was doing the right thing when it cames to the sale of their product. 'Investing in good quality assurance processes means you can be confident that the products you sell are safe and fit for purpose,' she said. The ACCC hopes through findings and studies, they can ensure safer products and accurate marketing claims in the cosmetic industry . That also includes claims, or false claims, about their product. 'Companies should not claim products are of a particular quality or standard when they are not.' 'Credence claims may relate to the presence or absence of an ingredient (i.e. formaldehyde free), product safety (i.e allergy tested) or the moral or social benefits of a product (i.e cruelty free, not tested on animals).' 'Consumers cannot judge the truthfulness of claims made about products and they rely on suppliers to provide accurate and truthful information.' In July, Fair Trading raided two Sydney CBD retail sites and one Western Sydney warehouse, after a tip-off that they were dealing in counterfeit cosmetics, including the world renowned Mac brand. NSW Fair Trading Minister Matthew Mason-Cox said more than 8,000 counterfeit products were seized as a result of the raids. 'Alarmingly, one complainant reported experiencing burns to her face after using the counterfeit products,' he said. 'Others reported that it was not until the product packaging had been opened that it became obvious they had purchased a fake due to a different colour and consistency to the genuine article.' The ACCC hopes through these findings and studies, they can ensure safer products and accurate marketing claims in the cosmetic industry.","Around 30 per cent of injuries are linked to cosmetics in the past year .
These include skin infections, bacterial conjunctivitis, folliculitis, corneal ulcers and anaphylactic shocks .
The ACCC has found some of those injuries are due to misleading ingredient labelling .
A study this year found that ingredient labels on some deodorants were not prominent or legible ."
"The traditional Aboriginal owners of Maralinga, the remote South Australian outback land on which Britain detonated seven atomic bombs  50 years ago, will finally be allowed back on the  nuclear testing site. The Australian Government  has officially returned the 1,782 square kilometre site to the Maralinga-Tjarutja people, granting them full access to the land known until this week as the 'Section 400' or the Woomera Prohibited Area. The owners are now planning to turn the land, which is 500km north-west of Adelaide, into a tourism mecca. Traditional owners: Maralinga-Tjarutja people gather in the South Australian outback town Maralinga Village to have the final parcel of their homeland returned to them, 58 years after Britain took over the land to drop atomic bombs and test nuclear warheads in the remote western desert region . Mushroom cloud: The atomic cloud  over Maralinga (pictured, left) after Britain dropped one of its nuclear test bombs between 1956 and 1963, causing widespread radiation sickness among the local Aboriginal people and contaminating the environment. Members of the Maralinga-Tjarutja community (above, right) attended a ceremony this week for the return of their land which was appropriated for the nuclear testing range . Return of the homeland: Maralinga-Tjarutja indigenous council chair, Keith Peters (left), accepts a framed map of the traditional owners' land from Australian Defence Minister  David Johnston (centre) and Indigenous Affairs minister, Nigel Scullion (right). The map shows a vast tract of South Australia's western desert which was used by Britain in the 1950s to drop atomic bombs and establish its nuclear power status in the Cold War . Poisoned ground: Nuclear testing programme worker John Stanier photographed in the 1950s on the ground in the South Australian town of Maralinga wearing protective clothing and carrying a camera in a plastic cover. Mr Stanier appears to be standing by the perimeter of a radioactive area at the atomic bomb testing site . Fifty years on: A local Anangu Aboriginal boy walks alongside a policewoman at Maralinga this week, as Australian Government officials flew in to the tiny South Australian town to hand back the title to the traditional owners of a parcel of land known as 'Section 400' - the nuclear testing range where Britain launched atomic bombs in the 1950s . The area is part of the 3,300 square kilometres of territory belonging to the Anangu Pitjitjantjara  indigenous language group which Britain appropriated to conduct nuclear tests between 1956 and 1963. Australian and British servicemen built the test site and an airstrip on Section 400 in 1956 in a region known colloquially as the Woomera Rocket Range, which had been established as a restricted access area after the end of the Second World War. Britain's defence authorities decided to test nuclear bombs at Maralinga, as well as at another South Australia region called Emu Field and the Montebello Islands off Western Australia, to establish its nuclear power status during the Cold War. Radioactive fallout: The Anangu people, from the Maralinga-Tjarutja community, gather this week for the formal handover of 'Section 400', an outstanding 1782 sq km portion of their land which was finally returned to them. More than 50 years ago, Britain used the land for nuclear testing, which caused skin rashes, diarrhoea, fevers and, later, blood diseases and cancer among Aborigines exposed to the radiation . Miles from nowhere: The vast region of South Australia's far western desert known as Maralinga was chosen for its remoteness by the Australian Government for Britain's Cold War nuclear tests. Many indigenous people as well as Australian and UK servicemen suffered the debilitating effects of radiation poisoning following the dropping of atomic bombs in the outback . Big day: A local Aboriginal boy climbs aboard the Royal Australian Force C-130J Hercules on the airstrip at Maralinga after defence force personnel flew in to attend the ceremony to hand back the piece of traditional land once used as a nuclear testing range by the British Government . Thanks a lot mate: Two members of the local indigenous community at Maralinga speak with Australian Defence Minister, David Johnson, at the ceremony held this week to hand back the country taken from the Aborigines, bombed by the British and poisoned with radioactive fallout. Australia spent $100m rehabilitating the land . Hundreds of nuclear trials were carried out. Britain dropped twelve nuclear bombs at Maralinga, and then went on to test nuclear warheads. Although many Aboriginal people were forcibly removed from their land, more than a thousand were directly affected. The widespread radioactive fallout of the bombs across the environment, which the local Aboriginal people called 'puyu' or 'black mist', caused disease and death. New dawn: Synonymous with the atomic bombs that were exploded secretly in its backyard, Maralinga is now hoping to capitalise on its name as a nuclear testing site and attract tourists . Then: Maralinga village in 1956 as seen from an aircraft flying over the north-east of the tiny outback town . Now: The RAAF C-130J Hercules casts a shadow over Section 400 as it flies in for the formal handing over of the land back to the the traditional Aboriginal owners, the Maralinga-Tjarutja community . Bombs away: Servicemen photographed celebrating at Maralinga in 1955, a year before the airstrip and nuclear testing site was built. Following extensive nuclear testing at Maralinga, both Australian and British military men stationed in the area suffered radiation poisoning . Anangu people, along with the non-indigenous civilians and Australian and British soldiers exposed to the radiation, suffered from radioactive poisoning, with symptoms including vomiting, skin rashes, diarrhoea, fevers and, later, blood diseases and cancer. A 1985 royal commission into the British nuclear testing in Australia found the fallout from exploding radioactive Caesium-137 and elements such as Uranium, Plutonium and Beryllium in the desert was three times greater than predicted, and that the tests left 'off the scale' Geiger counter readings 25 years later. The local Aboriginals, because of 'their unique lifestyle, and often their lack of clothing, footwear and permanent shelter' were particularly vulnerable to radiation; one group became sick after walking across highly radioactive ground in bare feet. Boom town: Maralinga village caretaker, Robin Matthews, outside his home in the town that he and other residents are hoping becomes a tourism mecca by trading in on its 'nuclear' name . Spartan: Inside one of the old barracks at Maralinga, where Australian and British servicemen slept during the seven years that atomic bombs and nuclear warheads were tested in the  South Australian desert . Final handover: Attending the official ceremony to hand over the final piece of homeland to its traditional owners are (left to right), Defence minister, David Johnston, Indigenous Affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, and Independent Senator, Nick Xenophon . Belly of the beast: South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon speaks with a crew member in the RAAF Hercules on the way to Maralinga in South Australia for the hand-over ceremony of Aboriginal land . Some land title was returned to its Aboriginal owners following the royal commission. The Australian Government spent $100 million cleaning up the land between 1993 and 2001. In 2004, special legislation was passed handing back the title over 21,000 square kilometres to the Maralinga Tjarutja and Pila Nguru people. The Department of Defence held on to Section 400 as a weapons testing range until this week. Sign of the time: The road sign to Section 400, the former nuclear testing site, says 'low level' radioactive contamination still exists . The final piece of homeland land was returned to the Maralinga-Tjarutja community at a ceremony in Maralinga village attended by hundreds of traditional owners, and the Defence Minister David Johnston and Royal Australian Air Force chief, Air Marshall Geoff Brown, . At the ceremony, Maralinga Tjarutja general manager, Richard Preece, said his community planned to set up a business to take visitors on bus tours of the traditional area and nuclear test sites. He said there was strong interest from four-wheel-drive clubs, 'grey nomads' and former servicemen who were based in Maralinga. Tours would begin in April next year. Indigenous Affairs Minister, Nigel Scullion, told AAP the tourism venture would allow the government  to work with the traditional owners to ensure the land could be used as a foundation for economic advancement. The Defence Minister, Senator Johnston, said he hoped the handover will provide some 'solace' to the Maralinga people, in particular those who were removed from their traditional lands and relocated to missions.","The British nuclear testing site in outback Australia has been returned to its Aboriginal owners .

"Last week, scientists announced the discovery of Kepler-186f, a planet 492 light years away in the Cygnus constellation. Kepler-186f is special because it marks the first planet almost exactly the same size as Earth orbiting in the ‘habitable zone’ – the distance from a star in which we might expect liquid water, and perhaps life. What did not make the news, however, is that this discovery also slightly increases how much credence we give to the possibility of imminent human extinction. Last week, astronomers said they had discovered a planet called Kepler-186f, artist's impression pictured. Kepler-186f is special because it marks the first planet almost exactly the same size as Earth orbiting in the 'habitable zone' This because of a concept known as the Great Filter. The Great Filter is an argument that attempts to resolve the Fermi Paradox: why have we not found aliens, despite the existence of hundreds of billions of solar systems in our galactic neighbourhood in which life might evolve? As the namesake physicist Enrico Fermi noted, it seems rather extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has been detected - UFO conspiracy theorists notwithstanding. This apparent absence of thriving extraterrestrial civilisations suggests that at least one of the steps from humble planet to interstellar civilisation is exceedingly unlikely. This image of Kepler-186f based on what the astronomers expect it might look like. Plant life is yellow due to the manner in which it reflects light from the star but the water and clouds would probably be more orange . The Great Filter is an argument that attempts to resolve the Fermi Paradox. This paradox questions why have we not found aliens, despite the existence of hundreds of billions of exosolar systems in our galactic neighborhood in which life might evolve. Physicist Enrico Fermi believed it to extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has yet been detected. He claims there must be some kind of barrier that prevents the rise of intelligent, self-aware, technologically advanced, space-colonising civilisations. We can think of  this barrier as a ‘Great Filter’. The absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct. The absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct. This bottleneck for the emergence of alien civilisations from any one of the many billions of planets is referred to as the Great Filter. What exactly is causing this bottleneck has been the subject of debate for more than 50 years. Explanations could include a paucity of Earth-like planets or self-replicating molecules. Other possibilities could be an improbable jump from simple prokaryotic life - cells without specialised parts - to more complex eukaryotic life. After all, this transition took well over a billion years on Earth. Proponents of this ‘Rare Earth’ hypothesis also argue that the evolution of complex life requires an exceedingly large number of perfect conditions. In addition to Earth being in the habitable zone of the sun, our star must be far enough away from the galactic centre to avoid destructive radiation, our gas giants must be massive enough to sweep asteroids from Earth’s trajectory, and our unusually large moon stabilises the axial tilt that gives us different seasons. These are just a few prerequisites for complex life. The emergence of symbolic language, tools and intelligence could require other such ‘perfect conditions’ as well. Physicist Enrico Fermi noted that it seems extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has been detected - UFO conspiracy theorists notwithstanding . According to the Great Filter theory, discovering life on another planet in a solar system would suggest that the emergence of life is not that rare. If it happened independently twice in a solar system, it must have happened millions times across the galaxy. This would mean that the Great Filter is less likely to occur in the early life of planets and is therefore more likely still to come. If the Great Filter is still to arrive, it would mean that there is some great event - such as its possible demise - that would prevent humanity from travelling to other parts of the galaxy. While emergence of intelligent life could be rare, the silence could also be the result of intelligent life emerging frequently but subsequently failing to survive for long. Might every sufficiently advanced civilisation stumble across a suicidal technology or unsustainable trajectory? We know that a Great Filter prevents the emergence of prosperous interstellar civilisations, but we don’t know whether or not it lies in humanity’s past or awaits us in the future. For 200,000 years humanity has survived supervolcanoes, asteroid impacts, and naturally occurring pandemics. But our track record of survival is limited to just a few decades in the presence of nuclear weaponry. And we have no track record at all of surviving many of the radically novel technologies that are likely to arrive this century. Esteemed scientists such as Astronomer Royal Martin Rees at the Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk point to advances in biotechnology as being potentially catastrophic. While emergence of intelligent life could be rare, the silence could also be the result of intelligent life emerging frequently but subsequently failing to survive for long . Others such as Stephen Hawking, Max Tegmark and Stuart Russell, also with the Cambridge Centre, have expressed serious concern about the exotic but understudied possibility of machine superintelligence. Let’s hope Kepler-186f is barren. When the Fermi Paradox was initially proposed, it was thought that planets themselves were rare. Since then, however, the tools of astronomy have revealed the existence of hundreds of exoplanets. That just seems to be the tip of the iceberg. But each new discovery of an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone, such as Kepler-186f, makes it less plausible that there are simply no planets aside from Earth that might support life. Kepler is a space observatory launched by Nasa to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. Data from Kepler could help humans find alien life . The Great Filter is thus more likely to be lurking in the path between habitable planet and flourishing civilisation. If Kepler-186f is teeming with intelligent life, then that would be really bad news for humanity. For that fact would push back the Great Filter’s position further into the technological stages of a civilisation’s development. We might then expect that catastrophe awaits both our extraterrestrial companions and ourselves. In the case of Kepler-186f, we still have many reasons to think intelligent life might not emerge. The atmosphere might be too thin to prevent freezing, or the planet might be tidally locked, causing a relatively static environment. Discovery of these hostile conditions should be cause for celebration. As philosopher Nick Bostrom once said: ‘The silence of the night sky is golden … in the search for extraterrestrial life, no news is good news. It promises a potentially great future for humanity.’ Andrew Snyder-Beattie works at the University of Oxford. This article was originally published on The Conversation.","Scientists claim there must a barrier that prevents rise of intelligent life .
Barrier - known as the Great Filter - could be in past or awaiting humanity .
If we find intelligent life, it would mean the Great Filter is still ahead of us .
This suggests an event will occur to prevent humanity – and perhaps all technological civilisations – from travelling to other parts of the galaxy .
We might then expect that catastrophe awaits both aliens and ourselves ."
"Fears surrounding the spread of Ebola have led to a string of false alarms by people fearing they have caught or been exposed to the killer disease. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) attempts to tackle the flood of worried Americans - with more than 800 Ebola false alarms coming in each day - a flurry of incidents have seen Hazmat officers boarding planes. On the other side of the Atlantic, last night a Liverpool coach station found itself at the centre of an Ebola scare after a female passenger arriving from London collapsed and vomited, with others on the bus seen sprinting from the scene. Scroll down for videos . Last night Liverpool coach station was at the centre of an Ebola scare after a female passenger arriving from London collapsed and vomited, with others on the bus seen sprinting from the scene. Medical staff boarded the coach in protective gear and removed the elderly woman, who is from Africa, wearing a protective garment and face mask. The woman was taken to Royal Liverpool Hospital where doctors confirmed she did not have the disease. It is understood she was feeling feverish and also had stroke symptoms. Witnesses described panic as the coach arrived at around 9.30pm with ambulance and police waiting. An onlooker said: 'There were loads of people on the coach and people were running and panicking when they got off. 'The ambulance service and police were there to meet it so I think the driver must have telephoned ahead. It was coming in from London. 'People wearing protective clothing got on to the coach and after a time brought the woman off. They put her in some sort of protective garment and a mask. It looked like a full alert.' Another scare saw a Hazmat team rush on to a plane from Philadelphia in the Dominican Republic after a man sneezed and yelled: 'I have Ebola!' National Express confirmed the station was closed for half an hour as a precautionary measure. Another scare involved a Hazmat team rush on to a plane from Philadelphia in the Dominican Republic after a man sneezed and yelled: 'I have Ebola!' The American passenger, who does not have Ebola, was detained by four officers and taken to the airport's medical center in Punta Cana as he declared: 'I ain't from Africa'. The remaining 255 people were forced to stay on board for two hours until he was cleared, despite airline staff insisting they believed it was a poor-taste joke. The man had reportedly been sneezing and coughing through the four-hour US Airways flight - an early sign of the often fatal disease. A video taken by one of the passengers in the middle of the Boeing 777 shows passengers standing up ready to leave before a flight attendant on a speakerphone tells everyone to sit down. Quarantine officials examined the plane and the man was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital for treatment. The 'unbalanced' man made the 'poor-taste joke' for attention, officials deduced in an interview . The Ebola virus causes fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and sometimes internal bleeding, and is spread through direct contact with body fluids. About half of those infected in West Africa have died. In Australia, a Jetstar plane was forced to make an emergency landing after a seriously ill passenger was reportedly vomiting blood on board on Wednesday night. A man in his 50s was greeted by paramedics and quarantine officials, including a woman wearing a white Hazmat suit, at Sydney airport after the Darwin-bound flight was forced to turn back. Staff wore protective gloves as they carried the sick traveller across the tarmac on a stretcher and a bright yellow protective plastic bag was also placed on the stretcher. Around 140 people were on board the flight, which had been in the sky for around an hour when the decision was made to turn back. The remaining 255 people were forced to stay on board for two hours until he was cleared, despite airline staff insisting they believed it was a poor-taste joke . A flight attendant warned passengers an 'idiot' had provoked them to call a Hazmat team on board . Quarantine officials examined the plane and the man was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital for treatment. The other passengers were offered hotel rooms after their flight was subsequently cancelled. A Jetstar spokesman told AAP the man was not suffering from Ebola. '(He) was vomiting, and it was clear (he was) quite unwell,' he said. He added that the passenger had a pre-existing medical condition that concerned the medical advisory team. The spokesperson would not disclose the medical condition, but said it was not contagious and there is now no concern of Ebola. France’s health minister Marisol Touraine today said that tests on a suspected Ebola sufferer at the Bichat hospital in Paris had proved negative. A man in his 50s was greeted by paramedics and quarantine officials, including a woman wearing a white Hazmat suit, at Sydney airport after the Darwin-bound flight was forced to turn back. The unnamed female American patient had been travelling in Africa, Ms Touraine said, but she was not suffering from the fatal disease. 'There have been no cases of Ebola in France, and this remains the case,' she added. This morning, tests showed that a  man in Prague hospitalised with symptoms of Ebola does not have the virus, said Czech Health Minister Svatopluk Nemecek. 'Laboratory tests did not confirm Ebola,' he told Czech Radio, confirming earlier media reports. 'There is a suspicion of malaria and further checks need to be done. The essential thing is that it is not Ebola.' The 56-year-old Czech businessman who had recently travelled in Liberia was put in isolation at a Prague hospital on Thursday with signs of the virus. Authorities in Taiwan tested a Nigerian woman for Ebola, after she showed symptoms of the virus, but it was revealed earlier today that she tested negative Ebola. She reportedly had a history of malaria. Around 140 people were on board the flight, which had been in the sky for around an hour when the decision was made to turn back . Quarantine officials examined the plane and the man was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital for treatment . In the Unites States, since Thomas Duncan became 'America's patient zero' on September 30, the CDC says it has received more than 800 calls per day from local health workers and other officials desperate to know if their patient has Ebola. In all cases except Mr Duncan's, that answer has been an emphatic no. On Wednesday, a Harlem man checked into Bellevue hospital complaining of a fever and was initially treated as a potential Ebola case, according to the New York Post. The man had recently traveled from Nigeria and was suffering from diarrhea and vomiting, but was apparently given the okay. Sergeant Michael Monnig tested negative for Ebola after spending 24 hours under observation . In Washington, DC,  Ebola was ruled out as a potential cause of illness in a man at Howard University Hospital just days after Mr Duncan's diagnosis. Around the same time, at nearby George Washington University, a patient was found to have the flu and not Ebola, as was initially feared. On Wednesday, an American Airlines flight landed at Midland airport in Texas and passengers filed out wearing masks after a passenger 'exhibited one symptom of the Ebola virus on a flight from Dallas'. She too, experts ruled, is Ebola-free. Sergeant Michael Monnig, a Dallas County sheriff, tested negative for Ebola  after spending 24 hours under observation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. He had entered the Dallas apartment where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan stayed before he was admitted to the hospital. He had no protective clothing and spent about 30 minutes inside. One week later, he showed up at an urgent care clinic in Frisco, Texas, and complained of stomach pains - which are among the common symptoms of the early stages of Ebola. 'Mr Monnig’s condition is good with no fever, no vomiting, no diarrhea reported. His current condition is NOT consistent with an early stage Ebola diagnosis,' the hospital said. Public health officials have said from the beginning that Sgt Monnig's chances of contracting the disease during his short time in the apartment were next to nothing. 'The risk is extremely low because this individual didn't have contact with the Ebola patient, but we want to err on the side of caution,' Texas health commissioner Dr David Lakey said. 'We understand there's a lot of anxiety in the community, and we hope getting test results back will help calm those fears.'","Scare at Liverpool coach station after passenger collapsed and vomited .

"Now in its 25th year, the breathtaking Icehotel in Jukkasjärvi, Sweden, is gearing up for its latest massive re-build. Opening again to guests in December, the hotel - located 200km north of the Arctic Circle and made entirely of snow and ice - is an architectural and engineering marvel. Each year, hundreds of artists from around the world apply to design a room - called an art suite - at the Icehotel. The jury then selects a handful of artists to come to Sweden in November and December for their vision to take shape. This year's artists have already been selected and room themes will range from a rainforest-inspired suite with orangutans to one art installation entitled 'Time Piece.' Each room is complete with a bed built by ice blocks, a thick mattress and reindeer skins, as well as a heavy-duty sleeping bag to keep the -7 degrees Celsius chill at bay. During the day, however, these 'cold rooms' must be vacated, since the hotel turns into an art installation for visitors. This season also marks the introduction of the Icehotel private function space - making icy cool weddings a stunning reality. The Aurora Hall will feature a private entrance, a stage for live performances, and inner walls made of solid ice, which will allow for unique acoustics and natural light conditions. Certain signature fixtures will make their return this year, as well, including the popular Icebar BY Icehotel and a gourmet restaurant as well as the 61 rooms, a unicorn sculpture and a theatre. Activities such as snowmobile tours, dog sledding, show-shoeing, and cross-country skiing are also available for guests. The 2014/2015 season will last from December through to March, before the hotel melts away, beginning in April. Scroll down for video .

"The South Carolina woman who drove a minivan into the Florida surf with her three children buckled inside requested to see them again. Ebony Wilkerson had been barred from any contact with her children, ages 3, 9 and 10, after she was accused of trying to kill them by plunging her car into the ocean. On March 4, a pregnant Wilkerson drove into the water at Daytona beach before exiting the minivan and attempting to stop bystanders from rescuing the children. Blood sugar: The attorney for Ebony Wilkerson said that the pregnant mother's blood sugar was dangerously low, causing her to become severely disoriented, which may have led to allegedly trying to take her kids' lives . Prosecutors charged she acted with 'premeditated design' after finding out she told her kids to close their eyes as they went in and that they'd soon be in a better place. 'Mom was going to drive us in the ocean to die,' one child told investigators. 'She was crazy.' One of the children fought with Wilkerson over the steering wheel as the car was entering the water and was able to lower the windows to call rescuers' attention. Hours before, Wilkerson's sister Jessica Harrell, 28, had called police after Wilkerson had driven from the house with the children and asked officers to perform a wellness check. 'She's talking about Jesus, that there are demons in my house, that I'm trying to control her, but I'm trying to keep them safe,' she told a 911 operator. An officer came across the family, and though the officer noted Wilkerson seemed mentally ill, the children were smiling and Wilkerson appeared lucid. Waves: Good Samaritans and police ran to the car and were able to save the three children inside from any serious injury . Safe: The three children were rescued and taken into foster care, and Wilkerson has had no contact with them since . Evaluated: Wilkerson was twice committed involuntarily while being held in custody, once for the attempted drowning, and once for punching her belly after being arrested . She told him that she was afraid her ex-husband would find her in Florida and said she was going to a location arranged with a domestic violence counselor. In 2005, Lutful Ronjon, who was at the time Wilkerson's common-law husband, was arrested for domestic battery after an argument between the couple over receipts. Wilkerson's public defender argued that Wilkerson's blood sugar was dangerously low at the time she drove into the ocean, making her severely disoriented. Paramedics tested Wilkerson's blood sugar level at 44, far below the threshold of 70 milligrams per deciliter, considered abnormally low according to the American Diabetes Association. Wilkerson was seen 'beating her stomach with her fists' after her arrest, leading officers to bring her to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. Circuit Judge Leah Case will hear her request for visitation Friday morning. She gave birth to her fourth child, a boy, in May. Since her arrest, she has not been allowed contact with her children. According to the Daytona Beach News-Journal, Wilkerson is out of jail on $90,000 bail while awaiting trial. She's charged with three counts each of attempted second-degree murder and child abuse.","Ebony Wilkerson, 33, was accused of trying to kill her children when she drove into the water in Florida with the doors locked and windows rolled up .

"A 130-year-old homestead has been destroyed by a blaze, just two days before its new buyers were to settle their $4.5 million sale. The 1,336ha historic home named Glen Alpine in Werris Creek, near Tamworth which is northwest of NSW, has been burnt to the ground with nothing left but its five chimney stacks and an underground cellar. It's a devastating loss for the new buyers who had plans make the big move from the city to enjoy a country lifestyle as part of their retirement. The mansion named Glen Alpine, in Werris Creek near Tamworth which is northwest of NSW, was burnt down on October 8 . The 130-year-old homestead was built in 1886 and designed by famous architect John Horbury Hunt . All that's left of the residence is its five chimney pots and an underground cellar . Fire crews were called out the home at 12.45am on October 8 but said it was 'pretty well gone' by the time they arrived . Peter Davis, captain of Fire and Rescue NSW's Werris Creek unit, says the home was 'pretty well gone' by the time emergency crew attended the scene at about 12.45am on October 8. 'There was nothing to save by the time we got there so we tried to stop the fire getting to surrounding bushland,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Buyers Antony Tisch and wife Wendy were devastated when they heard the news. 'We've been trying to buy the property for eight years,' Mr Tisch told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was such a magnificently beautiful home with a grand old staircase, ballroom and so much character. 'Not only is it sad for us but it's also sad for Australia.' The mansion, built in 1886, was designed by famous architect John Horbury Hunt. Mr Tisch, a Sydney landscaper and builder, says the property would be irreplaceable. 'The property survived 130 years of drought and fires but now it's just gone for nothing,' he said. 'To rebuild that signature house it'll probably cost $10 million and it'll be so hard to replace some of it.' The historic property was destroyed by a blaze just two days before its new buyers were to settle their $4.5 million sale .

"Christine Bleakley is replacing Holly Willoughby as co-host of ITV's celebrity skating show Dancing on Ice. The star, who quit the BBC last year with her former One Show host Adrian Chiles, said she was a 'total Dancing on Ice addict.' She will join co-host Phillip Schofield on the show when it returns next year for a seventh series. Skating in her shoes: Christine Bleakley has been announced as the new co-host of Dancing on Ice . Bleakley said: 'My only concern was what a big task it is to follow the brilliant Holly and I can only promise her, Phillip and everyone at home that they couldn't have a bigger fan of the show on board.' Schofield said he was 'absolutely delighted' that Bleakley was joining the show which was won last year by ex-EastEnders actor Sam Attwater. Bleakley and Chiles have struggled to recreate their One Show success on ITV's breakfast show Daybreak.

"For the second straight year, youth and adult membership in the Girl Scouts has dropped sharply, intensifying pressure on the 102-year-old youth organization to find ways of reversing the trend. According to figures provided to The Associated Press, the total of youth members and adult volunteers dropped by 6 per cent over the past year — from 2,994,844 to 2,813,997. Over two years, total membership is down 11.6 per cent, and it has fallen 27 per cent from a peak of more than 3.8 million in 2003. According to figures provided to The Associated Press, the total of youth members and adult volunteers dropped by 6 per cent over the past year — from 2,994,844 to 2,813,997 . While the Girl Scouts of the USA have had an array of recent internal difficulties — including rifts over programming and serious fiscal problems —  CEO Anna Maria Chavez attributed the membership drop primarily to broader societal factors that have affected many youth-serving organizations. 'Parents and families are less financially stable, frequently working two jobs or more, leaving little time to volunteer or take their children to extracurricular activities,' she said. In hopes of stemming the decline, the Girl Scouts are revamping their online platforms with new toolkits. One is aimed at streamlining the process of joining the Girl Scouts; another seeks to help volunteer troop leaders plan an entire year of meetings and activities with a single online visit. 'These tools will dramatically decrease the amount of time a volunteer has to spend preparing so that they can spend it serving the girls,' Chavez said. A crucial challenge, she said, is supporting the current ranks of volunteers and recruiting more adults to join them. A breakdown of the 2014 figures shows 809,413 adult leaders and 2,004,584 youth members. In 2003, there were about 2.9 million youth members and more than 900,000 adults. In some regions, a shortage of volunteers is forcing Girl Scout councils to turn away girls who want to join. Chavez said there are about 30,000 girls on waiting lists nationwide. 'The need for what Girl Scouts has to offer is not decreasing — more than ever girls need our time and our commitment,' she said. 'Our challenge is to meet them where they are with enough caring adults to serve them.' In hopes of stemming the decline, the Girl Scouts are revamping their online platforms with new toolkits . Last year, the Girl Scouts enlisted first lady Michelle Obama to make a video pitch for more adult volunteers. This year, there's a national recruitment campaign on Facebook. Just two years ago, the Girl Scouts celebrated their centennial with a host of upbeat activities, but it's been a rough stretch since then. There was disgruntlement in some regional councils related to a deficit-strapped pension plan, as well as revenue shortfalls that prompted the national headquarters to trim about one-fourth of its staff through buyouts and layoffs. Many alumnae — including some who were active as volunteers — complained publicly about the closure of some Girl Scout camps and what they perceived as a misguided shift away from camping and other traditional outdoor activities. Chavez defended the changes, which included new programs seeking to boost girls' competency with money matters and encouraging them to pursue careers in science and technology. The Girl Scouts also have defended their decision to enter a business partnership with Mattel, the manufacturer of Barbie dolls. There's now a Barbie patch that girls can wear on their uniforms and a Barbie Girl Scout doll. Two consumer advocacy groups — the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Center for a New American Dream — have urged an end to the partnership, saying Barbie is a flawed role model for little girls. If there's a broad theme to the Girl Scouts' current outreach efforts, it's to depict its programs as invaluable in helping girls grow up to be leaders, particularly girls disadvantaged by poverty and racial or ethnic disparities. A breakdown of the 2014 figures shows 809,413 adult leaders and 2,004,584 youth members. In 2003, there were about 2.9 million youth members and more than 900,000 adults . The Girl Scouts Research Institute recently compiled a comprehensive study, 'The State of Girls,' that assesses how the organization can help address social, economic, and health issues affecting the 26 million girls ages 5 to 17 in the U.S. That mission — as well as the membership problems and the new outreach strategies — will be discussed next week at the organization's national convention in Salt Lake City. Some other youth organizations also have been losing members, for reasons including competition from youth sports leagues and a perception by some families that they are old-fashioned. The Boy Scouts of America lost 6 percent of its membership last year; its youth membership has dropped from 3.3 million to about 2.5 million since 2002. The Boy Scouts alienated some conservatives last year by deciding to accept openly gay boys for the first time, while angering gay-rights supporters by maintaining a ban on gays serving as adult leaders . By contrast, the Girl Scouts have long had inclusive membership policies, although there have been some defections by families who felt the organization had become too liberal. American Heritage Girls, formed in 1995 as a Christian-oriented alternative, now claims more than 35,000 members.","Over the last two years total membership is down 11.6 per cent and off 27 per cent from peak of 3.8 million in 2003 .

"I've worked around politics and politicians for more than 25 years. And I thought I'd seen it all when it comes to political cynicism. Look at the long view and all the parties are as bad as each other, making promises they know can't be delivered or pledges they've no intention of honouring. But in nearly three decades of following politics, for sheer shameless, dishonourable and downright nasty cynicism, nothing I've encountered comes close to Ed Miliband's promise yesterday that for anyone with suspected cancer, under a Labour Government they will be able to 'go to the GP and within a week you get both the test and the result'. To read his interview, it was almost as if he was claiming a Miliband Government would be able to cure cancer in a week: . Criticised: Stephen Pollard says that in three decades of following politics, for sheer shameless, dishonourable and downright nasty cynicism, nothing he encountered comes close to Ed Miliband's cancer results promise . 'One in three of us is going to get cancer during our lifetime – that's incredibly scary,' he said. 'It's a massive killer. The number of people waiting more than six weeks has doubled – we are talking about millions of people each year. This will make a big difference to patients.' Except, of course, that the idea of a cancer test – any one test that can tell you 'yes' or 'no' – is utter nonsense. It's not just a false hope that he is holding out; it's a shameful piece of political posturing designed solely to boost Labour's poll rating without any basis in medicine or reality. We'll come to the specifics of his cynicism in a moment. But here's my context. The reason the Labour leader's pledge so disgusts me is that it is personal. Just under two years ago I was diagnosed with leukaemia. So, I know exactly what it means as a patient to be told that cancer is suspected, and then to have to go though the agonising waits involved. Anyone who has cancer will tell you that it's not just one wait, it's several. And while the jaw-dropping inefficiency of the NHS certainly prolongs those waits, even in Mr Miliband's fantasy world where the NHS could do everything at the drop of a hat, waiting would be inevitable. Because there is no one, single cancer test. There are many, of varying degrees of nastiness – just like cancers themselves. Cynical: Ed Miliband has chosen to make the centrepiece of his campaign on the NHS, one of the core issues of the General Election, a pledge on cancer that is essentially nonsense, according to Stephen Pollard . My own diagnosis was both fortunate and farcical. As I have a form of arthritis, I have to have steroid injections. After one, my brilliant GP looked at the blood tests that were part of the procedure and sniffed that something wasn't quite right. She sent me to a haematologist, who in turn sent me off to have a series of further blood tests. Looking back, I now think it's funny that she had the worst bedside manner imaginable. I saw her again when the results came back from the lab, and without looking up from her notes she uttered a sentence I will never forget: 'The tests show that you have either the after-effects of a virus or a form of leukaemia.' With hindsight, I was clearly an idiot because throughout the process to date the C-word never crossed my mind. I had been feeling run down and tired for years but thought it nothing other than the result of working long hours and having two toddlers. So when she said 'leukaemia' I was poleaxed. I needed more blood tests after some time had passed to see if a diagnosis was possible. Then, after these came through, she gave me the news: it was indeed 'a form of leukaemia' and I needed to see a consultant. When I saw him, he ordered yet another round of blood tests. So much for Mr Miliband's idea of one test. When these results came through, I was told I needed to have a sample of blood and bone scraped from my spine. I will spare you the full details. Suffice to say that no local anaesthetic is possible at the immediate place of incision, so the pain is, well, serious. The surgeon told me they only ever make two attempts to do the procedure in one session because it is so painful. Even if there was one overall cancer test that could be delivered within a week, it would be pointless without an NHS able to deliver the right care . They made an exception in my case – the house doctor was so incompetent that after five attempts she had still not got what was needed, before finally consenting to get the registrar. On his first go (and my sixth) he managed it perfectly. Then, finally, after four blood tests and a bungled procedure, the consultant was able to give me a full diagnosis, a month after my GP's initial concern. Even if the bone test had been carried out flawlessly, the process could not have been anything other than drawn out and ambiguous. And for good measure, when the consultant then tried to see when my leukaemia had actually developed by looking at the records of four previous operations I'd had over the past decade, not one of the four different hospitals – not one – could lay their hands on records they were supposed to have kept. So no one has any idea if I've had leukaemia for two years or 20. Seven days to find out if we have cancer, Mr Miliband? What disgusting cynicism. It is possible, I concede, that I am doing the Labour leader a disservice. Perhaps he doesn't actually know that this is how cancer diagnosis really happens, and that he's not being deliberately cynical. Perhaps, in other words, he's just being an idiot. Not exactly a comforting thought about a man who could be Prime Minister next year, is it? But given his track record, I've no doubt that it's naked cynicism. In July, Mr Miliband gave a little-noticed speech about political cynicism. According to him, what really threatens to stop Labour winning next year isn't the Conservatives – it's cynicism. He said: 'The belief that nobody can make a difference. That all politics is the same…They believe we value posturing more than principle. Good photos or soundbites more than a decent policy. Image more than ideas.' Ignore the breathtaking hypocrisy of such a speech from a man whose most stupid mistake so far was to forget to talk about the deficit in his party conference speech – a mistake that happened because he cared so much about his image that he chose to speak without any notes. Just think about this weekend's announcement in that context. Mr Miliband has chosen to make the centrepiece of his campaign on the NHS, one of the core issues of the General Election, a pledge on cancer that is essentially nonsense – based neither on medical reality nor patient need. Even if there was one overall cancer test that could be delivered within a week, it would be pointless without an NHS able to deliver the right care. But instead of focusing on a decent policy, as he put it in that speech, he is the one who is focused on posturing more than principle. Here's the cynicism. Labour has a 12-point lead over the Tories on the NHS – and Mr Miliband will do anything he can to keep the issue alive as one of the key battlegrounds of the General Election. Even if it means making cynical promises that leave this cancer patient simply nauseated.","Miliband criticised for promising Labour would speed up cancer tests .
Has been accused of making pledges he has no intention of honouring .

"A deserted airport customs lounge, luggage weighed by hand on an old fashioned scale and a cockpit with no digital assistance, are just some of the sites a photographer from Singapore has captured on camera after flying with the world’s only one-star airline. Aram Pan gained unprecedented access to the Soviet-era planes still used in North Korea by the nation’s civil carrier, Air Koryo, plus cargo transporters and helicopters, after joining a tour for aviation enthusiasts inside the communist enclave. From the photos, the airline, which was founded in 1950 as a joint North Korean-Soviet partnership to connect the capital Pyongyang with Moscow, appears to be stuck in a time warp. Scroll down for video . Photographer Aram Pan was greeted by smiling Air Koryo flight attendants dressed in smart navy blue outfits before he boarded an Ilyushin Il-18 plane, a large turboprop airliner. The Soviet aircraft was first flown in 1957 . Inside the cockpit of the Ilyushin Il-18 things looks very different to modern planes, there is not a digital screen in sight . The cockpit in the Ilyushin Il-18 plane, a large turboprop airliner that first flew in 1957, is a long way from digital. Astonishingly, the flight’s communication officer appears to sit in the passenger seating area and listens in to air traffic control on an ancient pair of headphones. While the Ilyushin Il-18 is known for its durability, with many planes achieving over 45,000 flight hours, there is a bold contrast in its appearance to modern aircrafts. Skytrak, an airline review service, rated Air Koryo a dismal one-star but gave it three stars for 'staff grooming and presentation'. And in March 2006, due to safety and maintenance concerns, Air Koryo was banned from flying into the European Union. In March 2010, the airline was allowed to resume operations  but only with their TU-204s aircraft. ‘At first I was a little nervous about flying,’ Mr Pan, who was on his third trip to North Korea, told Daily Mail Australia. However, he said after his first flight in a historic plane ‘it wasn’t scary at all’. Baggage check-in is a lot more old fashioned at Samjiyon Airport, a military airport near Samjiyon County, Ryanggang Province, North Korea . An Air Koryo flight to Pyongyang Sunan International Airport, the main airport serving North Korea, shows its ready for boarding. Mr Pan flew from Kuala Lumpur into Pyongyang with Air Koryo on the 25 August . The new modernised Pyongyang International Airport is nearing completion and looks set to open in 2015 . 'I was constantly looking forward to the next joyride. Besides… there were 48 other members of the tour group and everyone was like a kid in the candy store. I couldn’t possibly be nervous with everyone so psyched up about every ride,’ he added. Mr Pan flew out to North Korea with UK based company Juche Travel, who have been running DPRK aviation tours for the past three years. ‘The DPRK is now the only country in the world where you can reliably fly on all major Soviet era aircraft in one place,’ their website informs. From the 11-20 September, the flyers experienced eight different aircraft types on both scheduled international and internal charter flights. Inside the Ilyushin Il-18 there are blue chairs and blue carpet. Curtains draw across the windows and overhead luggage is stored less securely than in modern planes . Not enough leg room? Seats on the Ilyushin Il-18 all fold down. But entertainment is limited to only one channel playing their DPRK dramas and documentaries, Mr Pan revealed . The in-flight meal featured rice and chicken and fruit cocktail for desert. 'The food is better than I expected,' Mr Pan commented . In Mr Pan’s revealing photos, he shows the empty airport customs area at Pyongyang, the main airport serving North Korea, as well as a glimpse at the revamped International Airport which looks set to open in 2015. A new airport isn’t the only update North Korea is making to its airline. In 2013, Air Koryo appeared to be making efforts to update its image to the outside world, changing the uniforms worn by flight attendants from red and white to navy blue with a white studded trim. Flight attendants smile in the smart outfits in Mr Pan’s photos, their black hair swept back into chic buns. 'The air stewardess are polite and soft spoken. From what I understand, they never leave the plane to change shifts at Kuala Lumpur,’ Mr Pan said after his international flight. Inside the plane, entertainment is limited to only one channel playing their DPRK dramas and documentaries but the seats do fold down for extra leg room. In the services area of the Ilyushin Il-18, a steward prepared the meals metal containers. Unlabelled bottled water was stored in a tub . The female flight attendants served drinks from plastic cups. In 2013 some of the attendants' uniforms changed from red and white to navy blue with studded white trim . Life vests are stored under the seats of the Ilyushin Il-18 in case of emergencies. The toilet area features an old fifties interior . Mr Pan has previously visited North Korea twice, and in 2013 he witnessed bustling markets, men and women enjoying themselves at a Western looking water park and miles and miles of crops ready for harvest, shattering all of his illusions about what a holiday to North Korea would entail. This time he said his trip was 'a very different experience' because he wasn't on his own with just official guides to keep him company. ‘I ended up being the odd one out… it was like I attended a Star Trek convention and everybody was speaking Klingon. These guys absolutely love and know their planes,’ Mr Pan said of joining the aviation fans. ‘The tour group were all over the runway, happily snapping away at the planes. And the North Korean government didn’t even mind one bit,’ he said. In one of Mr Pan’s videos the tour group is seen running across the runway in a dash to get the best seats on the plane. And despite North Korea being known as highly-secretive, the photographer believes his latest tour shows things are becoming more open. ‘It's a huge leap forward in terms of relaxing the rules. Everyone was even allowed into the cockpits to take photos,’ he said. The communications officer on the flight sat outside the cockpit in the passenger area and listened in with an ancient looking pair of headphones . The old green seats in the Ilyushin Il-18 cockpit are covered with beige material. The empty weight of the plane is 35,000 kg . Mr Pan also took a flight on the Russian made Tupolev Tu-204. 'I'm told this particular plane is only 4 years old,' he said . The safety instructions on board the flights were in both Korean and English . Mr Pan said: 'The air stewardess are polite and soft spoken. From what I understand, they never leave the plane to change shifts at Kuala Lumpur' Toilets in the Tupolev Tu-204 were 'clean' and had 'no foul smell'. Mr Pan flew into Pyongyang again with Air China on 13 September . North Korea has recently been plagued by speculation after its leader Kim Jong-Un, who is usually widely-photographed, had not been seen since September 3. On Tuesday, the Communist regime’s ambassador to the United Kingdom became one of the first to offer a direct answer to increasing questions over his whereabouts. The lack of public appearances of the 32-year-old has led to speculation that he is either ill or even that he has been deposed. But he is healthy - and ‘there is no doubt about it’, one of the country’s most senior officials has insisted. In the five weeks since Mr Kim was last seen in the state media at a concert, he has missed several high-profile events that he normally attends. An official documentary released late last month then made a single reference to Mr Kim's 'discomfort' and showed video footage from August of him overweight and limping. However, speaking to the BBC, the North Korean ambassador devoted more time to questions about human rights abuses than to the whereabouts of the country's leader.

"It is a surreal sight. Hundreds of people running in the cold, pitch-black of a mid-autumn night, their faces lit from below by neon bands on their arms. And in the middle of this mass of humanity is 39-year-old solicitor Simone George, running on her own, glossy jet-black hair streaming down her back and tears running down her face. ‘I call it my 10k run and cry,’ she says. She is taking part in Life Style Sports Run In The Dark, a five and ten-kilometre race launched four years ago after Simone’s fiance, 38-year-old blind adventurer Mark Pollock, fell out of a two-storey-high window in 2010. He broke his back in three places and is paralysed from the waist down. The run takes place in 45 cities across the world and raises money for research into a cure for paralysis. A film about Simone and Mark, called Unbreakable: The Mark Pollock Story (released in Ireland and coming to the UK in the New Year), tells how they have overcome seemingly impossible hurdles. Light in the dark: Blind athlete Mark Pollock, 38, pictured with fiance Simone George, fell out of a two-storey-high window in 2010, broke his back in three places, and is now paralysed from the waist down . Originally from Holywood in County Down, Northern Ireland, Mark was five when he went blind in one eye aged five from a retinal detachment. This occurs when the retina comes free from the inner part of the eyeball. The problem affected his other eye when he was 22. In spite of two desperate operations to save his sight, he went completely blind. He subsequently forged a successful career as a motivational speaker and adventurer. Simone and Mark met when he took up salsa dancing and she, a solicitor, offered to help him learn. They were just four weeks away from marrying when Mark suffered his catastrophic accident. Simone has said that back then, she didn’t worry about Mark following his heart on extreme adventures, because he was so well prepared. ‘It is normally the mundane that gets you,’ she said. And that’s exactly what happened. Mark had been staying in a house with friends visiting Henley for the famous regatta when he decided to have an early night and went up to bed alone. Walking tall: Mark Pollock in the Ekso bionic suit . Simone was in Ireland, planning their big day. Inexplicably, Mark fell from his bedroom window and crash-landed on to concrete, fracturing his skull and breaking his spine. To this day, he has no idea how it happened. He spent 16 months in hospital. So marriage plans were put on hold and Simone found herself taking a year-long sabbatical and spending day after day sitting by Mark’s bedside. The spinal cord relays movement commands from the brain as well as sensory information back from the body up to the brain. It also controls certain automatic sensory information back from the body to the brain, and affects some automatic bodily functions such as breathing, sweating and regulating the body’s blood pressure. With a diagnosis of complete spinal-cord injury, Mark had no significant movement or feeling below his belly button. Although he believed he might pick up on his adventuring again, albeit in a wheelchair, a training trip to Norway made him realise that this was not possible. ‘I didn’t get the same buzz,’ he mourns. ‘I was being helped too much. Finding a cure for paralysis has become my adventure.’ Simone says: ‘I read literature about his condition almost from the moment he was in hospital. ‘When Mark’s South Pole team-mate, Simon O’Donnell, came to see him, I noticed that he was reading a book about neuroplasticity – how the brain and central nervous system are ‘‘plastic’’ and capable of change. It may be one of the keys to helping paralysed people.’ Simon offered to help Mark with physical training. ‘Without that, I think we would have given up on our quest,’ says Simone. ‘It’s hard enough going to the gym at the best of times, never mind when it takes three hours to get up, have a shower and get out of the door.’ Mark points out that in order to cure paralysis, we need to be aware of the unpleasant realities that come with it, such as lack of bladder control. And he gives an example to show how his paralysis affects every single moment of the couple’s lives. ‘If I want to turn over in bed at night, I have to be physically wide awake and use my arms to lift up my legs, and then I disturb Simone.’ Following a fundraising drive, Mark became the first person to have his own £100,000 Ekso Bionics exoskeleton suit, which allows him to walk, with support. ‘Now I can hug my girlfriend,’ he says. He already holds the accolade of being the first blind person to reach the South Pole on foot, and has also won two Commonwealth Games medals for rowing. He and Simone travelled to Los Angeles earlier this year to take part in a ground-breaking experiment. ‘Scientists from a number of disciplines are looking at a cocktail of treatments for paralysis,’ he explains. ‘This is a combination of therapies, including robotics, electrical stimulation and drugs.’ He has volunteered himself to help the scientists in their quest. Simone adds: ‘This is exciting stuff, this quest for a cure. And Mark does the hard stuff – the training, the drugs and the rehab. ‘Even if these interventions don’t help Mark, we hope to contribute to science which helps others.’ Race In The Dark is an acknowledgment of their current situation, and the atmosphere is electric with hope for the future. ‘The first year we did it was in Dublin and it was raining so hard,’ recalls Simone. ‘A man came over and told us that his baby had a spinal injury – hearing about Mark’s struggle was keeping him going.’ runinthedark.org takes place on November 12 in five official locations.

"A new plane seat design looks set to revolutionise long haul flights. Designed for use in premium economy and business class, at the flick of a switch, the seat can be transformed from single upright seat, to four-foot 'couch' and even into a full length double bed. It will allow young passengers in premium economy to lie flat, and will stagger seating to avoid the dreaded elbow clash - a very common complaint on long-haul flights. Hong Kong designer James SH Lee of Paperclip Design, came up with the concept, named Butterfly seating, which recently one first prize at IATA's 2014 Passenger Innovation Awards. A business class seat in upright mode. Passengers get a spacious private suite  with a seat plus a side couch and direct aisle access . The idea of Butterfly seating is to allow for individual demand of the cabin on each individual flight - despite the limited space on an aircraft. While only the business class passengers will be able to transform their seats into a full length bed, this is the first time that premium economy travellers will have access to a 'couch' allowing younger passengers the chance to sleep more comfortably. Lee told MailOnline Travel: 'This flexibility allows airlines to make use of resource more efficiently so that the cost is lowered. The layout maximises bed space, with the sleeping surface utilizing nearly every inch of available floor area . 'They can also react to fluctuations much quicker than before, making them much more resilient to the risks of changing market conditions.' 'For passengers this equates to  more stable fares long term, and the flexibility means more options for them. 'In the past if the business class cabin is full, then it's sold out. But with butterfly they can turn some premium economy seats into business class, and vice versa, if there's a need. At 53cm, the seating will be as wide as many current business class seats in a 777 sized cabin. Fliers in business class can transform the seat into a large bed, accommodating various sleeping positions . In premium economy, young passengers will be able to lie flat as their seat can be transformed into a 'couch' The seats will also feature large cocktail trays, seat pockets on the side and an adjustable ottoman. Meanwhile, passengers in business class will be able to transform the seat into one of the largest bed surfaces currently available. At 195.6cm long from top-to-toe, the seat becomes a private suite including a side couch. A graphic shows the conversion from premium economy to business class.  A mechanism that allows flight attendants to flip the window seat over, turning it into a couch. Passengers in Business Class will be able be offered one of the largest surfaces currently available . The designer added: 'Academic research on convertible seating used in European short haul flights shows a 3.3 per cent increase in revenue, which is hugely significant for the airline industry which makes a net profit between zero to four per cent globally.' 'Butterfly helps to extend this benefit to long haul markets,' he said.","The new seat design is for premium economy and business class suites .

"Police are to reopen 68 rape investigations where officers dismissed allegations that should have been pursued, it emerged yesterday. A review by Northumbria Police found that 54 allegations of rape were not investigated properly, possibly allowing sexual abusers to go unpunished. And Cleveland Police is reopening 14 rape investigations after an audit by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) revealed similar problems with the way its officers had dealt with allegations. Scroll down for video . Northumbria Police officers  have decided to reopen one in three rape cases from the past three years (file picture) Northumbria has removed dozens of officers from its sex crimes investigations unit following the discovery that one in three rape allegations recorded as ‘no crime’ should have been investigated. The officers have been told they could face disciplinary action. Rape charities said it was extremely worrying that so many cases had been handled incorrectly. The reinvestigations by Northumbria and Cleveland highlight growing concern that the problem may be widespread. Earlier this year HMIC criticised South Yorkshire Police for its ‘unacceptable’ handling of serious sexual crimes. In 2010 a rapist Northumbria policeman who attacked up to 30 women during a five-year reign of terror was jailed. PC Stephen Mitchell, 44, assaulted drug addicts in the cells and interview rooms of a city-centre police station, knowing that if they complained they were unlikely to be believed. One of them, a 19-year-old drug addict when he first struck, estimated she had been abused 100 times as he kept track of her using the police computer. Yet his colleagues ignored a series of warnings about his behaviour – some of them from his own wife. They were unaware that he had already stood trial for sex offences before he was recruited to the force. He was eventually sacked in 2007 for having ‘consensual’ sex with one of his victims, only to be reinstated on appeal eight months later. And when he was finally stopped, a senior detective with Northumbria Police offered him ‘a get out of jail free card’ if he agreed to resign. He refused, opting to take his chances in court. Mitchell – a tall, muscular former soldier – was found guilty of two rapes, three indecent assaults and six charges of misconduct in a public office, involving a total of seven women. He was cleared of three further rape charges, two indecent assaults and counts of misconduct involving another nine women. But police suspect he attacked at least a further 14. The watchdog found officers were put under pressure not to record rapes as crimes and police had spent a great deal of time trying to disprove the word of alleged victims. It has also recently been revealed that nearly a quarter of rape allegations made to police in parts of London were never recorded as crimes in 2013. An HMIC audit into the Northumbria force earlier this year found it may have incorrectly deemed 11 rape cases to be ‘no crime’, meaning that officers decided no law had been broken. After the audit the chief constable ordered a review of 153 allegations dating back to October 2011. Yesterday the force said it is to reinvestigate 54 of those cases. A 50-year-old man from Newcastle upon Tyne has already been arrested and subsequently bailed in connection to an allegation that was previously downplayed by investigating officers. Chief Superintendent Neil Adamson said the force had moved 48 officers from its rape investigations team to other units while the review was under way. The officers were served with gross misconduct notices, which could result in disciplinary action following the investigation. Potential victims who were initially told that rape had not been committed will now be contacted by officers, which police admitted could be stressful. Andrea Terrett, of Tyneside and Northumbria Rape Crisis Centre, said: ‘It is extremely worrying that victims have reported rapes and on investigation it is being stated that there has been no crime. ‘Only 10 per cent of rape victims that we help report to the police. But for these victims who have stepped forward, it is very disappointing and worrying for them to see that these cases have not been investigated properly.’ Northumbria’s police and crime commissioner, Vera Baird, described her ‘grave concerns’ when the HMIC report, which has yet to be made publicly available, flagged up the 11 suspect cases. She said the report showed police did not take seriously cases where a female complainant had consumed a lot of alcohol, or those arising in a domestic setting. Yesterday she said: ‘We took immediate action when the HMIC and, indeed, my office identified some rape ‘‘no crimes’’ of serious concern.’","Northumberland Police admit 1 in 3 rape cases may have been written off .

"Lone survivor: Bradley Morales, 16 (pictured), was driving without a license around 2am on Saturday when he lost control of his 1995 BMW and crashed, killing all five of his passengers. Morales survived, and underwent surgery for a skull fracture . California Highway Patrol continues to investigate a fiery car crash that killed five 14- and 15-year-olds returning home from a trip to Knott's Berry Farm this weekend. The lone survivor of that crash has since been identified as 16-year-old Bradley Morales, who is not licensed to drive. The crash happened around 2am Saturday as Morales was behind the wheel, driving his friends home from the amusement park's Halloween attraction, when the 1995 BMW hit a guardrail, rolled off an embankment then caught fire. Morales was either ejected from the vehicle or escaped before the fire broke out, but the three boys and two girls inside were not as lucky. The three male victims have been identified as Alex Sotelo, Matthew Melo and Brandon Moreno, who were all on the same soccer team. Laguna Hills High School student Jenny Mills was one of the females inside, while the other girl remains unidentified. The three male victims, from Mission Viejo, were identified by their soccer coach, who realized something had gone wrong when they failed to turn up for Saturday morning's game. Billy McNicoll told how Alex, his team's top goal-scorer, and Matt were well-established players, while Brandon was a newer addition. Their loss hit the team hard. Speaking to the LA Times, he said: 'These are good boys. We are devastated. Just devastated.' Alex and Matthew were ninth-graders at Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo, while Brandon was in the eighth grade at Carl Hankey Middle School in the same town. CHP Officer Florentine Oliva said skids marks on the freeway indicate speed may have played a role in the crash.  Investigators will also survey the damaged vehicle to check for signs of mechanical failure. CHP Sgt Todd Kovaletz said there is no indication drugs or alcohol were involved in the crash. Crash scene: California Highway Patrol is still investigating the cause of the crash but believe speed may have been a factor . Victims: Matthew Melo (left) and Alex Sotelo (right) are two of the male victims in the crash. They were returning him from a trip to Knott's Berry Farm when the deadly accident happened . Too young: Jenny Campos (left) has been identified as one of the female victims. The other girl remains unidentified. On the right, a picture of the third male victim, Brandon Moreno . Both girls and one of the boys appear not to have been wearing seatbelts. Morales was rushed to Mission Hospital on Saturday where he was underwent surgery for a skull fracture. However, he was last listed in serious but stable condition. It took emergency responders about 30 minutes to put out the blaze sparked by the crash,  during which time they were unable to approach the vehicle to attempt a rescue of the victims. 'This is one of the worst accidents a number of both CHP officers and firefighters have witnessed. To have five fatalities in one vehicle was extremely tragic today,' Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdai told ABC 7. Firefighters arrived at the scene in Irvine, California, to find five badly-burned bodies inside the charred BMW . Wreckage: The burned remains of the car were lifted off the I-5 freeway where the car veered off the road . The crash was one of two that happened just hours apart in Southern California that killed 10 people, including three members of the same teen soccer team and four recent graduates of the same high school. Five more people were killed about five hours earlier on Friday night, when three vehicles collided on an isolated two-lane road on the edge of Chino, a city east of Los Angeles in San Bernardino County. Authorities were working to identify the dead and determine the cause Saturday afternoon, police spokeswoman Monica Gutierrez said. The lone survivor of the three-vehicle crash - the driver of a Honda Civic - was released from the hospital, Gutierrez said. The dead included four in a Chevy truck and one in a Honda Accord. The victims in the truck included 19-year-old Andrew Anthony Deleon, 18-year-old Nathan Dominguez and two other friends, all recent graduates from the same high school, Dominguez's uncle Anthony Vasquez and coroner's officials said.

"A middle school principal and his guidance counselor pal who produced sexually charged slasher pics have been put on administrative leave by their schools. Dr. Mark Foley, a principal at Granby Memorial Middle School in Granby, Connecticut, and Aaron Vnuk, a seventh-grade guidance counselor at Windsor's Sage Park Middle School in Windsor, Connecticut, not only produced horror movies with nude scenes, but also ran a website that included images of scantily clad women. Among the titles produced by the duo were Mind Morgue, The Limb Collector, Demon of Castlebury, and The Bard of Blood. Caught: Dr. Mark Foley (right), a middle school principal and Aaron Vnuk (left), a seventh-grade guidance counselor, have been put on leave for producing sexually charged horror pics . Double life: The two produced multiple films, as well as running a site featuring women in lingerie and posing in sexually provocative ways . The two also made a full-nudity flick, Slicing Beauty. That film stars Kerri Taylor who 'bares all as a kinky serial killer who loves to give her victims a satisfying but often morbid peep show.' Foley, 45, worked under the pseudonym Mark Daniel, while Vnuk, 39, went by Aaron Thomas Howell, according to the Daily News. The two began making films together in 2008, meeting when Foley was vice principal at Windsor's Sage. They formed a company that became Moongoyle Entertainment, with a website that includes the tagline, 'Fresh Blood. Hot Babes. Cool Pics.' One shot on the site shows a woman dressed as a provocative schoolgirl. Scream queen: Kerri Taylor, above, stars in the film Slicing Beauty, which was produced by Foley and Vnuk . Femme fatale: It is said that in the film, Taylor's character 'bares all as a kinky serial killer who loves to give her victims a satisfying but often morbid peep show' The pair also released a calendar featuring Moongoyle Web hostess Violett Wolfe posing in lingerie that was 'popular with prison inmates' according to their Facebook page. The Moongoyle site and YouTube channel have been taken down in the aftermath of this controversy. 'The administration and [Board of Education] are concerned about the judgment used to be engaged in such activities while serving as an educational leader.' Granby Superintendent Alan Addley said in a written statement. 'The investigation will begin immediately and is expected to conclude promptly.' The Hartford Courant reports that Addley also added that there was no indication Foley had engaged in any illegal activity. No work: Granby Middle School in Granby, Connecticut, where Foley worked . Where it all began: The two first met at Windsor's Sage Park Middle School in Windsor, Connecticut, where Vnuk is still employed . 'Put in the context of a school, then it's not appropriate,' Foley said earlier this week. 'But there is no overlap there, that's the thing to keep in mind. This is not being done at school or anything.' He also made it clear that none of his films ever used one of his, or Vnuk's, current or former students. Vnuk has declined to comment.","Mark Foley, a middle school principal at Granby Memorial Middle School in Granby, Connecticut, has been placed on leave for making nude horror pics .

"A teacher's scorned ex-boyfriend has been arrested for hacking into the man's email account and sending nude photos of him to hundreds of students, teachers and community members. David A. Galvan, 38, was caught in Oregon last week after allegedly leaking the images of Richard Rosa, who works at John Muir High in Pasadena, California, earlier this summer. He allegedly accessed Rosa's work email account in July while the science teacher was out of the country and sent emails because he was angry that their relationship was over. He attached four shirtless photos the teacher, 31, had taken of himself, including two where the man's privates were also visible. Leaked: The ex-boyfriend of Richard Rosa, a high school science teacher, allegedly sent nude images of him (pictured) to students and teachers over the summer and he was finally arrested last week . Cruel: Rosa, pictured, was out of the country when Galvan allegedly sent the images to his colleagues . Galvan then allegedly sent them to as many as 287 people in the address book, including students, teachers and a member of the school board - with the subject: 'Enjoy.' Several of the recipients called the police. 'A criminal investigation was launched and detectives learned that Rosa was not responsible for the e-mails and he was out of the country at the time the emails were generated,' Pasadena police Lieutenant Terysa Rojas said, the Pasadena Star News reported. 'Further investigation revealed the e-mails were sent by Rosa's estranged partner, David A. Galvan, who had unlawfully accessed Mr. Rosa's Pasadena Unified School District e-mail account. Suspect Galvan was reportedly angry over the relationship ending when he distributed the obscene pictures.' On July 24, 2014, an arrest warrant was filed against Galvan for false impersonation, identity theft, internet/electronic impersonation and obscene matter. Victim: Rosa was not reprimanded by the school and hundreds of students signed a petition in support of him . When Galvan learned that he was wanted by police, he fled to Oregon but he was eventually detained on October 21 in Hillsboro, Oregon. Galvan waived an extradition hearing and was transported back to the Pasadena City Jail this week, before being transferred to the LA County Jail. He posted bail and was released from custody on Thursday afternoon. He is scheduled to appear in court on November 21. Rosa, who has been a teacher at the school since 2007, was not reprimanded by the school district in the aftermath of the incident. The X-rated email sent from his account prompted School Superintendent Jon Gundry to issue a written apology to the recipients, KTLA reported at the time. Devoted: Rosa, a science teacher, has worked at John Muir High School since 2007 . ‘If you received this email, I would like to apologize for any harm this email might have caused and want to assure you that we are working with the relevant authorities to investigate the matter,’ he wrote. Even though he did not face termination, John Muir student Devin Perry preemptively launched a 'Save Mr Rosa' petition online, which received hundreds of signatures. ‘Mr. Rosa is one of the most professional teachers I know and I would hate for a great teacher to lose a job based on a mistake that may have been an accident,’ Perry wrote. ‘He's taught me so much and I don't want a teacher who has impacted lives to be turned down because of a mistake.’","David Galvan 'sent an email containing four photos of his ex, teacher Richard Rosa, from the man's work account with the subject ""Enjoy""'

"More than 100 dogs are trapped in 'disgusting, inhumane' squalor at a puppy breeding farm in north-western NSW, despite notifications to the RSPCA and local authorities, says an animal rights group. Debra Tranter, founder of Victoria-based organisation Oscar’s Law, says she was ‘horrified’ to find a heavily pregnant labrador, lying dead on the cold concrete floor of a shed at the rural property near Armidale recently. ‘Usually when I go into these places, I shut down emotionally because I just have to get the photos,’ Tranter told Daily Mail Australia. ‘This time I was caught out: I just sat there with her and patted her for half an hour, it was so sad. The worst part is that her death was preventable.’ Ms Tranter, who has been rescuing  dogs from 'puppy factories' for more than 20 years, travelled to the property this week to photograph the abuse after she was tipped off  by members of the community. She  has made several trips to the farm since January and says she reported what she saw to the RSPCA numerous times. ‘We've been complaining about this farm for more than a year now and the authorities have ignored us,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. ‘This time I had to go public.’ Scroll down for video . The  pregnant Labrador found dead by animal rights activist Debra Tranter at a NSW property that breeds dogs for pet stores . Traumatised and scared: One of the dogs locked up in a shed at the back of the property near Armidale, NSW . RSPCA chief inspector David O'Shannessy has told Fairfax Media that  the owner complies with minimum standards for breeding facilities. 'There are no immediate concerns for their welfare,' he said. But the owner of the puppy farm, Jennifer Frazer, has been known to authorities for over a year. In December, the RSPCA raided the property and charged Frazer with aggravated animal cruelty and failure to provide veterinary care. She was made to relinquish 27 dogs, fined $11,500 and was placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond, Fairfax reported. Debra Tranter says the 'puppy factory' should have been shut down. 'This case proves that the system we have cannot properly safeguard animals,' she said. 'A fine to a puppy farmer is nothing more than the lost sale of one or two puppies to a pet shop.' Tranter says there are currently about  130 dogs at the property who are living and giving birth in 'filthy, filthy conditions' and at least 10 dogs that require immediate veterinary care. ‘There is one dog I'm especially concerned about: A Labrador that is never let out of her enclosure, she is only being fed every other day, at most, and she is so lame she struggles to walk. She has a number of mammary tumours but it's her lameness and pain that is so distressing.' 'She is so lame she struggles to walk,' says Debra Tranter, who travelled to rural NSW to photograph animal abuse at the Frazer property near Armidale. A vet report that was leaked to Ms Tranter and used in the RSPCA's case against Ms Frazer last year,  described the poor condition of several dogs that had to be put down following the property raid. It noted one female terrier who was being attacked by a pack of other dogs. 'She had an abdominal wound from which her intestines had eviscerated. She had multiple puncture wounds over her body and bruising around her eyes. Her jaw was clamped shut and she had a trickle of fresh blood from her nose,' the vet had written. These puppies were locked with their mother in a 'freezing cold' shed in the middle of winter . Debra Tranter wants the leadership of RSPCA NSW  to change, saying that in all her years investigating puppy farms across Australia, she has only ever had poor responses from the NSW branch. She has called for the resignation of NSW CEO Steve Coleman. ‘The RSPCA has the highest authority to act to stop animal cruelty. We have to take these cases to the RSPCA which is why it’s so important for people in the position to show strong, compassionate leadership. ‘I honestly believe that the reason these dogs have been left behind is because it’s seen in NSW as just too hard and too expensive to relocate and rehabilitate them.' Tranter says the response from some arms of government has also been disheartening. She says NSW Shadow Minister for Primary Industries, Steve Whan, has emailed her organisation to complain about being 'bombarded' with hundreds of rude emails petitioning for action on the factory farming of pets. The department is responsible for administering the 1973 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Neglected: Despite being charged with animal cruelty, property owners have been allowed to continue operating their dog-breeding business . When the Daily Mail spoke with Ms Tranter, she was on the road taking a car full of rescue dogs that had been seized by council officers from an illegal farm  in Victoria. She was taking them to a veterinary nurse, and then on to foster care for rehabilitation and behavioural therapy. She says she has a 'pretty good' success rate with her rescue dogs. 'We work incredibly hard, however long it takes, to get them to learn to be in a house and around people - our vet bill is horrendous!' 'These little ones are quite traumatised and they have a long journey ahead of them - but they will be ok.' Tranter says there are hundreds of 'puppy factories' in Australia, some registered but many operating illegally. The only way to stop this, she says, is to put an end to the sale of cute puppies in pet shop windows. 'Puppy farms are very much a hidden industry, so the chances of breeders being caught or having a complaint lodged against them is less than small,' she said. 'We are lobbying for a full ban on puppies in pet shops. Pet shops are simply retail outlets for puppy factories that perpetuate abuse.' The puppies in the bread basket were huddled together to keep warm in near freezing temperatures in August, with nothing but a filthy, bloodied rag, says Tranter.

"A young father shouted 'boom' as he threw a single punch which killed an innocent man who was trying to break up a pub fight. Jake Sweeney's head was smashed on the pavement - cracking his skull in two - after Jason Grovell, 24, delivered the fatal blow outside the Irish Tymes pub in Caerphilly, South Wales. Grovell had been drinking and taking cocaine with friends on a night out when one of the men got in a fight after the pub's closing time. Jason Grovell, 24, was today jailed for four years after punching Mr Sweeney so hard his skull cracked in two . Cardiff Crown Court heard that 26-year-old Mr Sweeny had tried to 'defuse' the situation by stepping between the two men. But as he walked away he was struck on the side of his head by Grovell, who jumped and shouted 'Boom!' as Mr Sweeney crashed to the ground, . Prosecutor Michael Jones said: 'Grovell threw a gratuitous, forceful, unexpected and cowardly punch. Mr Sweeney's only involved was to act as a peacemaker and he was of no threat.' He was seen smiling and 'bouncing like a boxer' before fleeing the scene in August this year. Jake Sweeney, 26, was killed by a single punch after he tried to break up a fight at a pub in South Wales . Scene: The fatal blow was delivered outside the Irish Tymes pub (file picture, above) in Caerphilly . Office worker Mr Sweeney died four days later from his injuries and father-of-one Grovell was arrested. Grovell, who is an accounts worker, initially claimed he could not remember the attack but later admitted manslaughter. Grovell, of Caerphilly, who appeared in court in a grey suit and glasses, was jailed for four years today. Judge Eleri Rees told him: 'This was a cowardly act by you. Mr Sweeney didn't see the blow coming and had no chance to defend himself.","Jake Sweeney, 26, died after head smashed on pavement and skull cracked .

"Lisa Ling, 41, said she started seeing a man called Tom, who was much older than she was, in her early 30s and would travel the world with him . Lisa Ling has revealed that she once had a sugar daddy and became 'seduced' by the luxury lifestyle they lived together. The married TV host, 41, said she started seeing a man called Tom, who was much older and wealthier than she was, in her early 30s and would travel  the world with him. The mother-of-one, who is about to front a new show called This is Life with Lisa Ling, described how he would take her on yacht cruises in the Mediterranean and would go on shopping sprees with her in Rome. Even though the former co-presenter of The View has travelled around the world as a reporter, she was taken to destinations new to her, and quickly became 'sucked into his vortex'. She made the admission as part of a new series called which focuses on women who look to get into relationships with sugar daddies in a bid to get financial support. Writing for CNN, she said: 'I met ""Tom"", who was much older and more successful than me. 'We started dating in my early 30s at a time when my career had me traveling all over the world to report stories. I was neither looking for a relationship nor cared to be in one.' 'It started to become glaringly apparent that I was being seduced by a lifestyle. I was becoming a sugar baby. Or at least, that's how I felt'. She said that before she met Tom, she developed a strong desire for self-sufficiently after growing up as a 'fiercely independent woman' and 'die-hard feminist' For her it was 'personal' as her parents had always fought over money-related issues during their divorce when she was just seven years old. Scroll down for video . Tom liked her because of her 'independent spirit', but she thinks he quickly started to hope that she would give up her job so he could look after her. 'He was not at all a bad person, but increasingly, I was starting to feel owned and that I was losing myself,' she added. During the first show of the series, she interviews a woman who has signed up to SeekingArrangements.com to find 'sugar daddies' - or older, richer men who would spoil them. The married TV host (pictured at the Golden Globe Awards when she was 32) said she started seeing the older man in her early 30s and quickly became 'sucked into his vortex' The 41-year-old, who married oncologist Dr Paul Song in 2007 (pictured), said she became 'sucked into his [Tom's] vortex' as he took her on yacht cruises in the Mediterranean and shopping sprees in Rome . Alongside her long list of TV accolades, she and her husband have a one-year-old daughter called Jett . She goes to a party where young women try to find a suitor. All of the attendees are in masks and some of the men are married. Ling then interviews some of them, asking them why they want to pick a partner using the method. One admits they were homeless when they went on their first 'sugar date' while others used it as an opportunity to go to college because they had nothing. Ling was 26-years-old when she chosen from an estimated 12,000 young women who applied to be the new View co-host in 1999 after Debbie Matenopoulos left the show. After leaving the show in 2002, she started to focus on international reporting, with a series of documentaries. Ling married Paul Song, an oncologist, in May 2007, five years after leaving the morning show. In October 2012 Lisa announced on Anderson Cooper's talk show that she and husband Paul Song were expecting their first child, a baby girl. She gave birth to a daughter named Jett Ling Song on March 8 last year.

"Fitness trackers typically monitor people as they move around and exercise, but many of us spend hours at a time sat at our desks, leaving these trackers a little redundant. But now, a designer has created the world's first 'inactivity tracker' - a smart cushion that monitors a user’s heart beat, breathing rate and posture, through their bottom. Called Darma, the device identifies when people are slouching, or if their stress levels are too high, and provides tips to correct it using an app. Scroll down for video . The Darma cushion, (pictured) uses sensors to monitor a user’s vital signs, including their posture, heart beat and respiratory rate. The smart cushion identifies if a user is slouching, and an app offers tips to correct their posture. Darma is due to launch in June and will cost $199 (£122) Size: 15.7"" x 15.7""x 1.2"" (40cm x 40cm x 3cm) Sensors: 1mm fibre-optic sensors. Padding: Multi-layer memory foam . Battery: Lithium-ion battery last for one month on a single charge . Connectivity: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Charging: USB mini port . Apps: Free on iOS and Android . Price: $199 (£122) plus $25 (£15) shipping . Expected delivery date: June 2015 . The name was inspired by Bodhidharma, the person attributed as the 'father' of Zen and meditation by the California-based firm. After collecting a user's vital signs, the free Darma app recommends certain activities based on what it detects. For example, if a user has been sitting down for too long, the app warns them, and offers stretches they can do to limber up. When slouching, the app helps users, in real time, change their position by guiding them using on-screen prompts. When high stress levels are detected, Darma tells the user to take a break, or offers a guided meditation plan. These levels can also be tracked over a period of time, to identify key moments of stress and find ways to resolve them. Darma connects to a smartphone using Bluetooth, and its lithium-ion battery is said to last for one month on a single charge. The 1mm sensors inside the cushion have been developed to detect even the tiniest of body movements. They were designed by California-based Dr. Junhao Hu. Dr Hu has created a prototype and has already received $124,000 (£76,700) to fund production of the device, through a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign ends on 14 November and models of the cushion are expected to ship in June, for $199 (£122).

"A headteacher who left a vulnerable child crying on the floor outside of her office for so long that she wet herself has been struck off. Susan Stuart, 68, had been in charge at Greenfields Community Primary School in Kettering, Northamptonshire since 2004. However, a panel at the National College for Teaching and Leadership heard how the child was twice taken to see Stuart in 2008, with one teacher claiming she was left there for four hours. Susan Stuart has been in charge at Greenfields Community Primary School in Kettering, pictured, when it is claimed she left a vulnerable child weeping outside her office . Stuart, who insisted that the child was there for 60 minutes, would open the door and say 'stop making that noise' when she heard the child sobbing, the hearing was told. Meanwhile another teacher said that the child informed them that on one occasion the child was in such a state, she wet herself. The head teacher said the child was throwing a tantrum after refusing to attend music assembly, and that she 'needed to learn that having a temper tantrum would not get her what she wanted.' Panel chair Martin Greendale said: 'The panel was concerned that the child was not treated with dignity and due regard for the child's welfare. 'The panel were particularly concerned that Mrs Stuart had not demonstrated insight into how she could have acted differently, save for stating that with regard to the child it would have been better for her to have been placed in an empty classroom with a Learning Support Assistant.' Stuart, who has been retired for four years, was also found to have made a girl cry when she could not eat a 'revolting' lunch that had been provided because of her dietary requirements. As the child was being walked to collect a homemade lunch from her mother as a replacement, Stuart intervened saying: 'You will eat it. Be grateful for what you have got.' A hearing at the National College for Teaching and Leadership heard that on one occasion the child was in such as state that she wet herself . Other infringements included placing a colleague under undue pressure, and not providing adequate support for her to fill her role, and asking another teacher to call another member of staff who was on sick leave. Mr Greendale added: 'In light of the panel's findings against Mrs Stuart, which involved a failure to treat a child with dignity and with regard to her welfare, there is a strong public interest consideration in the protection of pupils. 'Although Mrs Stuart is retired, she could return to teaching at any time, if a prohibition order was not imposed.' Stuart was found to have behaved inappropriately with regard to more than one child, and more than one colleague. She was also found to have made a number of errors in school policy including not updating the prospectus since 2005. As a result she was banned from teaching, and cannot apply for the order to be set aside until 27 October 2016. Speaking after the hearing Stuart now says she intends to appeal the decision. She said: ‘I strenuously deny it. It is simply not true. I will most definitely appeal this. ‘I am totally innocent of the charge relating to the child who was outside my office. It just isn’t true. ‘There was an investigation by the governors and I was exonerated.’","Susan Stuart had been in charge at Greenfields Primary in Kettering .

"A youthful yet chilling voice  belonging to a nine-year-old boy calls for the reclamation of Islamic authority around the world. His father, who proudly shared the video on social media, is a devout supporter of  Hizb-ut-Tahrir - the controversial Muslim group which organised protests in western Sydney last week against 'government aggression'. In the footage, seen by Daily Mail Australia, the child  stands before a Sydney gathering to deliver a sermon about sacrifice and victory of the Muslims. The boy addresses his fellow 'brothers and sisters' as he chants passages from the Koran and preaches in his Australian accent. A video of the nine-year-old preaching to his 'brothers and sisters' in Sydney has been posted by his father . Another video shows the boy, 7, in 2012 addressing protesters at a rally in Sydney . 'Today we see the same sacrifices in the Muslims and the mujaheens in Syria and Afghanistan and in Palestine and all around the Muslim lands who know that only Islam can bring mercy to mankind,' the boy preaches. 'Let us take this opportunity, in this month (Ramadan) … by sacrificing everything for the sake of Allah. 'Let us pray that Allah will release the calamities to this Ummah and brings back Islam as an authority and as life to be an example to the humanity and send mercy to mankind.' His father, who Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to identify, posted the footage on Facebook in July - during Ramadan - which was then shared a number of times. More videos of the boy delivering a sermon were posted by his father on Facebook in 2013 . The father of the boy is a supporter of controversial Muslim group Hizb-ut-Tahrir . His father, who also shows his support for Hizb-ut-Tahrir online, has also posted similar videos of the boy in previous years. The child stood before a Sydney protest in support of the Syrian uprisings in 2012, at the age of seven, where he delivered another speech. 'We witness that our brothers and sisters in Syria, in Afghanistan, in Palestine and other countries has been oppressed by corrupt tyrant rulers,' the boy said. 'They sacrifice their lives and they sacrifice their families for the sake of Allah. May Allah help our Ummah to work day and night to establish the (caliphate) that will protect and free all Muslims from oppression.' On the father's Facebook page, disturbing images of soldiers brandishing Islamic flags  and children holding machine guns  can be seen. He also posted an image which declares: 'Say no to democracy.' It also appears he attended a Sydney rally organised by Hizb-ut-Tahrir last Thursday night, following a series of pre-dawn anti-terrorism raids -  the largest counter-terrorism operation in Australian history. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the nine-year-old boy's father for comment. The operation last week saw 800 police officers carry out 25 search warrants across Sydney's north-west and in three Brisbane suburbs. About 200 protesters took to the streets to defend their rights as Islamic Australians in Lakemba, western Sydney, with signs reading 'terror raids cannot break the spirit of Muslims' and 'stop terrorising Muslims'. In August, a shocking photo of a young boy holding a head of a decapitated soldier in Syria emerged on social media when it was posted by his father and convicted Australian terrorist, Khaled Sharrouf. It was accompanied by a photo of Sharrouf himself holding the same head, written with the words: 'What a head', and another of him and three young boys brandishing rifles. Since departing Australia, Sharrouf has been using his social media pages to boast about the Islamic State group. Sharrouf is wanted by the Australian Federal Police for alleged terrorist activities in the Middle East after he fled the country in December on his brother's passport.","The boy stood before a Sydney gathering as he speaks about sacrifice and victory of the Muslims .

"Ecobot III 'digests' organic matter and then excretes the waste as sludge - it's the first robot designed to eat and get rid of waste just like a human . They have made robots that talk, walk and speak like humans. Now researchers have taken another leap forward in android technology - with a robot that eat just like a human and, just like a human, has to visit the toilet. The team created a robot which uses organic matter for fuel, then 'excretes' the waste. They claim it could be the first step on the way to a new generation of ‘eco bots’ that may even need their own toilets - or share those humans do. Another theory is that they could actually be toilets themselves, and use human waste for power. Such a scenario has until now been the stuff of science fiction - the time-travelling Delorean in Back to the Future Part 2 was famously powered by waste food. The discovery was made by the Bristol Robotics Laboratory, part of the University of Bristol in the UK. The first prototype had a microbe-powered fuel cell that ran off E. coli bacteria which fed off refined sugar. The second model tried using sludge microbes to break down rotten food.Both of these had a hitch, however, that they had no way of getting rid of their waste, meaning they became poisoned. Step forward prototype three, dubbed ‘Ecobot-III’ which BRL roboticist Ioannis Ieropoulos said  ‘collects its own food and water from the environment’. Ecobot III can't find itself a sandwich, of course - it picks up its sugary food from a track within its Bristol laboratory. He said: ‘It performs the task we design it to do, and at the end of the day, it gets rid of its own waste. It literally craps into its own 'litter' tray.’ Robot with cakes and biscuits: ¿Ecobot-III¿ can find its own food. Roboticist Ioannis Ieropoulos said the machine ¿collects its own food and water from the environment' John Greenman, a microbiologist at the BRL added: ‘Robots that eat biological fuels could find enough fuel almost anywhere. ‘There is organic matter anywhere on Earth - leaves and soil in the forest, or even human waste such as urine and feces.’ The researchers have already received enquiries from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and NASA which could put them on missions to Mars to keep astronauts company.","Ecobot III digests organic matter and visits a litter tray .

"A whistleblower says her career was destroyed by NHS managers after warning about how vulnerable patients were coming to severe harm. Dr Hayley Dare, 42, a psychologist,even claims to have received a poison-pen letter from one of her bosses saying her children would suffer if she lost her job which also threatened: ‘You cannot win, you cannot beat us’. She said conditions were so appalling at the mental health unit where she worked that one 72-year-old woman died after staff forgot about her. Whistleblower Dr Hayley Dare, 42, a psychologist, said conditions were so appalling at the mental health unit where she worked in Ealing, west London, that one 72-year-old woman died after staff forgot all about her . Dr Dare, who worked at the Orchard, run by West London Mental Health Trust, said staffing shortages meant patients were able to assault each other as well as doctors and nurses. She has taken a case against the trust claiming she suffered detriment after whistleblowing over alleged poor patient care and bullying of staff. Giving evidence to Watford Employment Tribunal in Hertfordshire yesterday, she said she raised concerns with chief executive Steve Shrubb last March. She said she was spurred on by an NHS drive for whistleblowers to come forward in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal. But Dr Dare claims managers threatened her and made her life miserable. And a month later, she said she received the poison-pen letter which, also stated ‘how hard it will be on your children if you are unemployed’. She said: ‘I no longer have any confidence in my trust, given that the duplicitous behaviour is from the chief executive down. I fear my career has been destroyed as a consequence of whistleblowing and my health has suffered significantly. ‘The trust did not complete a full investigation into the concerns I raised and it did not conduct an independent investigation.’ She said that in March 2012, the trust’s forensic director Andy Weir closed a ward on the unit without warning. This led to a 72-year-old woman having to sleep in a padded unit because there was no bed for her and she died a fortnight later. Dr Dare said: ‘Many staff members raised concerns with me about the lack of safety and high levels of violence on the ward, the level of self-harm that service users were engaging in and the failure of senior management to support clinical staff. 'There was ongoing bullying from senior staff and Mr Weir. Despite being very fearful about the consequences and what would happen to me, I decided that I had no choice but to whistleblow, first thing on Monday, March 18, 2013, to the chief executive Steve Shrubb.’ She also said that managers had slashed staffing levels – despite concerns from senior doctors who warned it would put patients at risk. Two months later – last May – a female patient hanged herself. Dr Dare took compassionate leave last May and returned to the unit last September. She said that since then, she has been offered only lowly positions for which she was overqualified. And she said that since December, her treatment by the trust had left her suffering from depression, anxiety, migraines, panic attacks and trauma. The Mail has repeatedly highlighted how whistleblowers have been victimised for raising the alarm over poor standards despite the fact that the NHS said last year it would make it easier for whistleblowers to come forward. Ian Scott, representing the trust, accused Dr Dare of enjoying ‘conspiracy theories’ and denied that her colleagues were in a ‘cohort’ against her. The tribunal continues.

"Dental problems can signify more than sweet tooth - and could even be a sign of serious disease, an expert has warned. From the colour of your teeth to the condition of gums, the mouth can tell you a great deal about your overall health, says Dr Sameer Patel, Clinical Director at Elleven Dental, London. Even minor dental conditions can sometimes be a sign of more serious health concerns, he warns. So what should you be looking for? Here, Dr Patel outlines some key warning signs... Scroll down for video . Your mouth can provide clues about your overall health - and could indicate you are stressed or have an underlying condition, dentists say . BAD BREATH: Liver disease . If you’ve tried brushing your teeth and tongue as well as flossing regularly and using breath fresheners, bad breath may be a symptom of something more serious and indicate a disease elsewhere in the body. These include stomach disorders, indigestion and occasionally liver disease. This often shows no other symptoms in the early stages but is more likely to occur if you drink a lot of alcohol. Visit your dentist if you have any concerns. YELLOW TEETH: Medication . A number of medications have been linked to yellow teeth. These include antibiotics such as tetracycline - often used for acne - mouth rinses specifically used to treat gum disease, and medicines for high blood pressure . The best way to treat yellow teeth is to seek professional advice on whitening. Toothpastes which claim to ‘whiten’ teeth will only remove superficial stains and not have any impact on the colour of the existing surface of the teeth. Unsuccessful attempts to freshen breath could indicate a disease elsewhere in the body, such as stomach disorders, indigestion and occasionally liver disease . DRY MOUTH: Diabetes . Although a dry mouth can often be attributed to dehydration and other factors such as alcohol consumption and smoking, a lack of sufficient saliva is one of the earliest symptoms of diabetes. The condition causes blood vessels in the salivary glands to thicken and slows down the natural production of saliva. This can make the gums more prone to infections. Other symptoms include excessive thirst, tingling in the hands and feet, frequent urination and blurred vision. If you suffer from the above, be sure to visit your GP. ULCERS AND RECURRENT SORES: Oral cancer . When an open sore in the mouth doesn't go away within a week or two, it always warrants visiting a dentist or doctor. Although it is common to suffer from mouth ulcers when we are run down and our immune system is suppressed, if a problem area persists, this might need to be checked. Look out for raised sores with red or white borders as well as bleeding and numbness. More than 30,000 people are diagnosed with oral cancer every year, most over the age of 60. C . ases are often detected late and if you are a smoker your risk is increased. Symptoms of bruxism (tooth grinding) include unexplained jaw ache and headaches. The condition causes the teeth to look flat and worn . BLEEDING GUMS . It is estimated that gum disease affects more than half of us. Bleeding gums during or after brushing - as well as bad breath - can be a sign that you have gingivitis, which is inflammation of the gums. If left untreated, a condition called periodontitis can develop - an infection of the tissues and bones that support teeth and hold them in place. In severe cases, this can cause the bone in the jaw to decay and small spaces can open up between the gum and teeth. Ultimately, teeth can become loose and fall out. To lessen your chances of developing gum disease, its imperative to brush and floss teeth daily - and change your toothbrush every three months. Visiting a specialist periodontist and hygienist can also help to combat gum problems and prevent bacteria from building up. FLAT, WORN TEETH: Stress . Grinding your teeth at night can often be a sign of emotional or psychological stress which can manifest itself when we are asleep. Many people are surprised when they learn that they are tooth-grinders but dentists will normally recognise this straight away by the texture and consequential flatness of the teeth. Symptoms of bruxism, as it is called, include unexplained jaw ache and headaches. To prevent damage to teeth, sufferers can have custom-made splints made by dental professionals to relieve the symptoms and protect teeth at night.","Even 'minor' dental conditions can signal more serious health problems .

It charges via USB and can store 32GB of video and images with a microSD card. The device is splash proof but, if user's are planning to submerge it in water, they'll need to use the included waterproof casing. In addition, the device is magnetic, and it can easily attach to bikes and other surfaces using an included clip - something that fans of GoPro will be pleased to hear. An integrated microphone and LED-light for night use round out the features. The Polaroid Cube is splash proof but not waterproof, so a protective casing (shown left) will need to be used if it goes underwater. A bump casing (right) also helps it survive tumbles and falls . If you've ever wondered what your dog really gets up to, or simply wanted to experience life from a dog's point of view, a new harness could be the answer. The Fetch harness lets owners attach a high definition GoPro camera, made famous by extreme sports enthusiasts, to their pet. Owners can even choose their point of view - either mounting the camera on the dog's back or chest. HTC's device, meanwhile, is called the ReCamera. The device is small and appears to be curved at one end. In a teaser video, it is shown shooting underwater, highlighting its waterproof capabilities. And it also appears it can shoot in slow motion, based on the slower segments of the teaser video. In one of the leaked images, first spotted by Reddit user fodawim, the device seems to be attached to the strap of a bag, suggesting it will be easily mountable on different objects. No other details have been released, or leaked. A Twitter account set up for the camera, @re_camera, has just one tweet at the moment. It said: ‘Taking a picture has traditionally meant you’re busy behind the camera, framing the scene. But what have you been missing?’ And in the teaser video the company said: ‘Something remarkable is coming.’ Taiwan-based HTC has teased a new camera to compete with GoPro. The portable action camera will be formally announced on 8 October. In a video it appears the device is waterproof, while leaked images (one shown) reveal that it looks a bit like a toy periscope with a button below the lens to maybe take selfies .

"A sharp rise in the number of hospitals missing cancer waiting time targets is putting lives ‘at risk’, a charity warned last night. Damning figures emerged yesterday which show that the number of NHS trusts missing the main cancer waiting target has tripled in just a year. The NHS recommends that no one should wait longer than 62 days after being referred urgently by their GP for suspected cancer. NHS recommends that no one should wait longer than 62 days after being referred urgently by their GP for suspected cancer (File photo) A government target requires that 85 per cent of patients are seen within this time. But between January and March this year, no fewer than 27 NHS trusts missed the target – up from eight over the same period the year before. It means that thousands of cancer patients are waiting far too long for potentially life-saving treatment, thanks to a shortage of consultants and MRI scanners. Separate figures show that the amount of money spent on NHS cancer care has fallen by almost £800million in real terms since the election. The revelation comes on the day that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt addresses the Conservative conference in Birmingham. The Department of Health says the rise is down to the fact that more people are being treated. Separate figures show that the amount of money spent on NHS cancer care has fallen by almost £800million in real terms since the election.The revelation comes on the day that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt addresses the Conservative conference in Birmingham . But Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘Jeremy Hunt should stand up before the Tory conference today and order an immediate halt to these disgraceful cuts to cancer care. ‘On his watch, people are waiting longer for treatment and tests and now we know why. ‘This is why people can’t trust him and David Cameron with the NHS. He should apologise and produce a plan to bring cancer services back up to the national standard.’ The figures on the number of trusts failing to meet the target were contained in a report published by health regulator Monitor two weeks ago. Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘Jeremy Hunt should stand up before the Tory conference today and order an immediate halt to these disgraceful cuts to cancer care' It found that: ‘Performance against cancer waiting time targets has steadily deteriorated over the past year. ‘The number of trusts failing the target rose to 27 at Q1 2014/15 compared with 8 at Q1 2013/14.’ The report said the high level of referrals from GPs had led to the decline in performance, but added: ‘When combined with rising emergency demand and elective referrals, a further increase in cancer referrals creates pressure on diagnostic, surgical and inpatient bed capacity. ‘In addition, foundation trusts have also cited late referrals, consultant shortage (especially in urology), complex diagnostic pathways, and inter-trust referral protocols as some of the reasons for breaches.’ Other reasons include ‘inadequate outpatient and diagnostic capacity’. Figures released following a Parliamentary question show that NHS expenditure on cancer services has fallen in real terms from £5.91billion in 2009/10, the year before the election, to £5.68billion in 2012/13. It means that in three years since the election, £790million less has been spent on cancer than otherwise would have been spent had pre-election levels been maintained. Last night Duleep Allirajah, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘It is deeply concerning that the number of NHS foundation trusts missing the cancer treatment target have more than trebled in just a year. This is unacceptable. ‘Delays mean that thousands of cancer patients must put their lives on hold while waiting for vital treatment - causing anxiety, distress and putting their lives at serious risk. ‘These delays are yet another clear warning sign that the system isn’t working and the NHS is under huge strain. ‘Everyone should have the best possible chance to survive cancer but lives are being put at risk and this can’t continue. We already have some of the poorest survival rates for cancer in Europe. Macmillan is calling on all the political parties to ensure that cancer remains a top priority ahead of the next general election.’","Amount of money spent on NHS cancer care has fallen by almost £800million in real terms since election .

"So Mario Balotelli is on the brink of joining Liverpool and completing the shock move of the summer. When I first saw the news breaking, my initial reaction was ‘This can’t be true’; I had serious misgivings. Since then, though, I have changed my stance because of the economics — £16million for a 24-year-old who is Italy’s No 1 striker looks a great deal. If you consider Ross McCormack moved from Leeds to Fulham for £11m, it is even better value. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's biggest, baddest and best Balotelli moments . In town: Mario Balotelli arrives at Liverpool's Melwood training ground ahead of his medical on Friday . In demand: Balotelli signed autographs for young supporters as he left Melwood later on Friday . And if Balotelli fails to deliver, Liverpool could expect to recoup most of their outlay. I admit he still has to convince me as a player. People talk about his behaviour off the pitch — that doesn’t worry me too much and, in truth, I think some of it is quite funny. It is what happens when he crosses that white line that is important, and he has yet to show me he is as good as some people have claimed. We faced each other a few times when he was in England and I never saw a lot from him at Anfield. He was subbed in his three appearances there and sent off after 18 minutes as a substitute. On target: Balotelli celebrates after scoring against England during Italy's 2-1 World Cup victory in June . Ordered off: Balotelli is shown a red card during Manchester City's 1-0 defeat by Arsenal in April 2012 . There is, however, a player lurking in that frame. He has been outstanding on the two occasions he faced England at major tournaments, causing problems with his pace and power. If he’s like that, Liverpool will have done some smart business. Daniel Sturridge will find three games a week difficult, so there will be rotation issues and how they play as a pair will be intriguing. Above all, Liverpool have a fabulous spirit under Brendan Rodgers that has carried them far. Balotelli can’t be allowed to jeopardise that.

"On trial: Karen Carberry, 45, falsely claimed to be a qualified accountant to get a job with the recruitment giant Reed in 2001 and siphoned off £300,000, the Old Bailey was told . A finance director accused of stealing more than £300,000 to fund her 'love of shopping' told police she did it for her disabled daughter, a court heard. Karen Carberry, 45, falsely claimed to be a qualified accountant to get a job with the recruitment giant Reed in 2001, the Old Bailey was told. She began siphoning cash out of company accounts in 2009 and spent huge sums on shoes, holidays and a hot tub as well as gifts for her family, the jury heard. When questioned about the missing money by her employers, Carberry supplied them with a bogus certificate from the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), it is claimed. Carberry was later arrested and made no comment other than to tell an officer: 'I knew this was going to happen. I'm so sorry. I did this for Charlotte [her daughter]. My husband is going to kill me.' She told jurors at the Old Bailey that this comment referred to her fear she was going to lose her job. Carberry explained: 'I hadn't done anything wrong. I was sorry to my family, how I was going to go home and tell my husband I wasn't going to have a job. I worked as many hours as I could so that I could take time off to be with my daughter and go with her to hospital. I worked really hard for my daughter.' Carberry insisted was an ACCA qualified accountant and passed the exam in 1996 after doing a distance learning course. She claimed that the original certificate was framed and put on the wall at her parent's home and was lost when they moved house. The copy supplied to Reed in 2012 was a copy supplied by the ACCA, she said. 'I paid a fee of £20 to get a copy,' she added. Case: The Old BAiley heard that she transferred a total of £303,317.60 into her personal bank accounts . Carberry denied exploiting problems in the Reed accounting system to cover up her thefts and rejected claims she could 'blag' her way through audits by Deloitte. She claimed that her claims for furnishings, flights, accommodation, fixtures and stationery were all related to work and that she received a bonus of £10,000 for setting up a reward scheme. Her £1,000 long-service award was used to buy a hot tub for her family home, the court heard. Carberry said: 'It has to be over £1,000 and we wanted a hot tub so we bought a hot tub.' Prosecutor James Norman told jurors that Carberry stole money to fund her extravagant lifestyle and added: 'She would often have items delivered to the office and would joke about her love of shopping.' Defending her shopping habits, Carberry insisted she made most of her purchases online. 'They were personal goods, handbags and shoes, children's clothes. 'We have a disabled daughter that does gymnastics and a son that plays football. 'I don't go out, I enjoy buying shoes.' It is claimed she transferred a total of £303,317.60 into her personal bank accounts between 2009 and 2012 to lavish her family with gifts and pay off her credit card bills. Carberry, of Epsom, Surrey, denies obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception between July 1, 2001 and July 31, 2001, fraud by abuse of position between 6 August 2009 and 9 July 2012 and two counts of using a false instrument between 13 August and 29 August 2012.

"An Australian family have given up their life in the suburbs and instead moved halfway across the world to take on an enormous and unusual task. Karina and Craig Waters purchased the Chateau de Gudanes in 2013, nestled into the hillside on a ledge overlooking the Midi- Pyrénées in the south of France. Built in the mid-eighteenth century, the sprawling property was designed by Parisian architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel and originally owned by an influential member of Toulouse Parliament. Scroll down for video . This stunning French chateau is being restored by an Australian family . Karina and Craig Waters bought the Chateau de Gudanes in 2013, and began restorations last November . Spiral staircases which lead to some of the many levels in the house are dotted throughout . The Chateau's website states the building was created for: 'Louis Gaspard de Sales, Marquis de Gudanes. Gaspard, also known as the ""King of the Pyrénées"", (who) was an influential member of the Toulouse Parliament, and ironmster of the Ariége' in the 1700s. On social media the history of the spectacular 94-room property has also been well documented. 'This Class 1 Historic Monument was designed by Parisian architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel, famous for his neoclassical, architectural symmetry, including the Le Petit Trianon and Place de la Concorde,' one entry reads. The property also features a magnificent-sized pool with views of the mountains . There are dozens of rooms in the sprawling property with original brickwork still visible . The Waters left their hometown of Perth to take on the mammoth challenge . The have found some friendly foals who often roam the grounds of the romantic property . 'Now this sleeping beauty is being reawakened by an Australian family, as they start their restoration, giving back the love it deserves, and unravelling the spirit of the past. Opening the door to a world of wonder, both real and imagined.' Since November last year the Waters have been restoring the huge mansion, which was on the market for four years before it was purchased by the Perth-based family. Photographs posted to their website and Facebook page show the progress of the historic chateau, which was half in ruins when it came into its current owners hands. The chateau sits on the edge of a ledge overlooking the Midi-Pyrénées in the south of France . The family have enlisted help in tackling the massive restoration . Spiral staircases lead down into many of the room in the chateau . Spectacularly high ceilings and original details on the walls still exist in the house . Spiraling staircases, dozens of rooms, spectacularly high ceilings and original details on the walls of the property are some of it's most impressive features. A magnificent pool out the back, the stunning setting and original brickwork, paintings and architecture plus friendly animals which roam the ground only add to the wonder. The Waters hope in the near future to have a running cafe and tours of the stunning rooms, with their impossibly high ceilings and intricate detail dating back centuries. Looking ahead to 2016, the Waters aim to have accommodation, a gift shop, spaces for weddings and other functions, plus the ability to host local music festivals, fetes, conferences and other events at the chateau. The detail in this keyhole could date back as far as the eighteenth century . Original stone walls still exist around the chateau . Some parts of the property needed more work than others, like this staircase covered in rubble . As for the legacy of the newly restored chateau when 'she' is finished, the Waters are hoping the beautiful building which sits between snow-capped mountains in the winter will live on. 'The Chateau won’t be a pretentious museum piece, but rather, a place to visit, reconnect with the earth and people, and restore the senses, just like she herself has been restored,' their website reads. 'It won’t be about overcrowding the walls with paintings or overflowing the floors with furnishings, but will be relatively minimalistic - a place to simply rest, breathe and enjoy the calm.' Meantime another Australian family are currently undertaking a very similar expedition, recently dropping everything to move to the French countryside. The Bromley family, from Mosman in Sydney's northern beaches, have taken it upon themselves to restore a romantic 14th century French chateau to its former glory and share it with romantics everywhere by transforming it into an affordable boutique hotel. In winter snow is visible on the surrounding mountains . The Waters hope to turn the stunning chateau into a place where people can visit or stay .

"Ian McLoughlin, 55 (pictured), murdered Graham Buck, 66, while on day release from HMP Springhill in Grendon Underwood, Buckinghamshire, last year . A prisoner who murdered a Good Samaritan while on day release was allowed to walk out of the open jail without a proper review due to a number of security blunders, it has emerged. Ian McLoughlin, 55, butchered Graham Buck, 66, while on day release from HMP Springhill in Grendon Underwood, Buckinghamshire, where he was serving a 25-year jail term for murder. He had also already served a long sentence for manslaughter prior to his latest killing in July last year, which came after prison staff allowed him to be ‘released on temporary licence’. Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, said a number of ‘procedural’ failings resulted in the criminal being allowed out as part of preparations for his eventual release. He said there had been a ‘failure to undertake a formal risk assessment’ of the killer and told the justice secretary that it was not appropriate for him to have been released. An inquiry into his release found that staff did not review his offender assessment system on his arrival at the Category D prison and concluded that staff should have considered his criminal past before allowing his temporary 12-hour unsupervised release. McLoughlin killed Mr Buck on July 13 last year - the first day he was eligible for day release during his sentence for murder. Within hours of hitching a lift from the prison, McLoughlin went straight to the house of Francis Cory-Wright, 87, an Old Etonian he met in prison two years earlier while Cory-Wright was serving a 30-month sentence for indecently assaulting a ten-year-old boy. As McLoughlin filled a pillowcase with family heirlooms and cash from the victim’s £1million Hertfordshire home, Cory-Wright shouted for help from a window. Mr Buck went over to investigate and was confronted by McLoughlin, who dragged him inside the house and slashed his throat. Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, said a number of ‘procedural’ failings resulted in the criminal being allowed out of HMP Springhill (pictured) - a Category D prison in Grendon Underwood, Buckinghamshire . Company director Graham Buck, 66 (left), died after he went to help neighbour Francis Cory-Wright, 87 (right) He committed the crime while already serving a jail sentence for murder, after he stabbed his Brighton landlord Peter Halls to death in 1992. It was only 17 months prior to that killing that he had been released from prison, having been jailed for ten years for manslaughter in 1984. Aged 25, he admitted admitted to police he had done a ‘bad thing’ after crashing a car while drunk. Officers then went to the home of Len Delgatty, 49, from Stoke Newington, North London, and found his body upside down in a cupboard, with his skull smashed in seven times with a hammer. The house had been ransacked for cash. McLoughlin was charged with murder but was found guilty of manslaughter, after he claimed he had attacked Delgatty – who had served time for having sex with teenage boys – only after he told him of a fantasy for under-age sex. He was released after five years after behaving as a ‘model prisoner’. The full report into his release and those of two other offenders at different prisons will be published in full when an ongoing trial involving one of the men has concluded. McLoughlin killed Mr Buck at the home of Francis Cory-Wright in the sleepy Hertfordshire village of Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted, last year. He was on temporary day release from jail at the time of the murder . McLoughlin killed Mr Buck when he tried to intervene and stop the criminal as he ransacked the £1million home . After his latest killing, police issued a 'wanted' poster in the major manhunt to find McLoughlin . Ian John McLoughlin, also known as Ian John Baker, has been described as ‘astonishingly bright’, with an IQ of 140. Born in Lancashire in 1958, he spent much of his youth in care homes and picked up a string of convictions for petty theft and burglary. By his early 20s he was a drifter, reportedly earning money as a rent boy and sleeping rough when his cash ran out. He briefly married at 25, but his marriage collapsed under the strain of his heavy drinking and his continued involvement in crime and prostitution. In October 1983, he was stopped by police after crashing a stolen car in London while drunk. Kept in a cell to sober up, he demanded to see the custody sergeant and told him: ‘I’ve done a bad thing.’ McLoughlin had killed a gay man, Len Delgatty, smashing his skull seven times with a hammer before strangling him with a towel. At his trial, McLoughlin told the jury that Delgatty, 49, – who had previous convictions for sexually abusing teenage boys – had played him an audio tape describing a graphic sexual fantasy of having under-age sex with a teenage boy. McLoughlin claimed he had ‘panicked’ and repeatedly struck out at Delgatty. He said he had thrown the tape away. The jury convicted him of manslaughter, not murder, and he was sentenced to 13 years, reduced to eight on appeal. He was released in 1989 after serving only five years. Just 17 months later he stabbed gay barman Peter Halls, 55, through the neck at his home in Brighton. In July 1992, he was convicted of murder and given a life sentence, with a minimum tariff of 25 years. McLoughlin’s 25-year minimum term would have meant he was eligible for release on licence in 2017 but he was moved to a Category D ‘open resettlement prison’ so he could prepare for life outside.","Ian McLoughlin, 55, killed Graham Buck while on day release from prison .

"Confession: David Redmond has allegedly admitted to killing his own baby son because the infant irritated him . A 24-year-old Washington state father has been charged with first degree murder after admitting throwing his 'fussy' newborn baby nine-feet across a room, causing the child fatal brain damage. Vancouver man David Redmond told police he abused his one-month-old son Everett every day of his short life and came home on the evening of October 15 and lost his temper with the baby, tossing him at the child's changing table. 'I threw him pretty hard,' said Redmond to detectives when he admitted the murder of the six-pound baby, police papers reveal. 'I was pretty annoyed.' Redmond appeared in Clark County Superior Court on Monday in a green suicide prevention vest and the judge announced he was being held on $750,000 bail ahead of his next court appearance on October 23. During his solemn court appearance, a police affidavit was read out that detailed the horrifying abuse dished out by the violent father. 'David said he was frustrated with this, so he dropped Everett onto his changing table, causing Everett to bump his head on the wooden rail,' wrote Vancoucer police detetive Jason Hafer. Hafer wrote. 'Everett paused for a second with his mouth open, then started crying a high-pitched noise.' According to the Columbian newspaper, Redmond's wife Ashley was not home at the time. She gave birth to Everett premature and underdeveloped at three pounds and 14 ounces. Wracked with guilt, Redmond went to check on his son later during the night and found him to be unresponsive. Panicked, he woke his wife and told her their son was not breathing properly and they called 911. Desperate: David Redmond was made to wear a 'suicide smock' after he told police he was suicidal. Visible on his right arm is his Biblical tattoo that preaches 'turning your back from your evil ways' Depression: David Redmond appeared in court on Monday in a suicide prevention vest and was charged with the first-degree murder of his son, Everett on October 15 . The baby was rushed to Randall Children's Hospital at Legacy Emanuel Medical Center in Portland, but was diagnosed as brain dead shortly after arrival. Doctors observed the child's injuries and asked the couple, who married in May, 2013, what happened. Redmond lied and said that earlier in the day he was napping with the baby and accidentally rolled over onto him. Subsequent scans revealed Everett had a huge skull fracture, soft tissue swelling and bleeding inside the brain that caused his eyes to hemorrhage appalling. Doctors initially feared 'shaken baby syndrome' but when the full extent of the child's injuries were revealed they informed police that they had been caused by blunt-force trauma. Confronted by officers, Redmond allegedly confessed and told police he had abused his son every day since his birth. On one occasion he held his own son's jaw shut to stop him crying and threw him around the room when his infant wailing irritated him. Tragic: The Redmond's home in Vancouver where David Redmond allegedly abused his son, Everett . He also admiited to spanking the child when Everett was one week old. Police told the court that Redmond is depressed according to the Columbian. 'We believe the defendant has mental issues,' said Deputy Prosecutor Patrick Robinson. 'He had indicated he wants to die.' Redmond's mother, Jenifer, took to Facebook to express her shock. 'We had a horrific tragedy happen,' wrote Jenifer Redmond. 'Our son out of exhaustion hurt our baby grandson. The baby died. Our son is not (the) monster that the news station and papers would like you to believe.' Redmond also has a tatoo on his right shoulder that references the Bible, 2 Chronicles 7:14 - according to the Columbian. 'If then my people, upon whom my name has been pronounced, humble themselves and pray, and seek my face and turn from their evil ways, I will hear them from heaven and pardon their sins and heal their land,' the scripture says.","David Redmond began abusing his son Everett the day after his birth .

"Banned: Maria Adams, 20, received a two-year driving ban for recklessly towing a friend in a Tesco wheelchair around a car park . A motorist has been banned after she was caught on camera in a car park dragging around a man in a wheelchair in a 'stupid' stunt. CCTV captured driver Maria Adams, 20, recklessly towing a friend in a borrowed Tesco wheelchair around a car park at one of the supermarket's stores in Sunderland on January 10. Her irresponsible male companion can be seen clinging to a towel attached to the back of Adams's black Nissan as she hurtles up and down the car park, dragging him back and forth behind her. The footage, which was played at Newcastle Crown Court, shows stunned shoppers loading bags into their cars as the call-centre worker and her friend shoot up and down the central lanes. Several other vehicles also enter and exit the car park - forcing the pranksters to temporarily put their dangerous game on hold. Prosecutor Neil Pallister told the court: 'She was towing a wheelchair, with a male sitting in it, around the car park. 'The wheelchair was one of Tesco's, for use by customers. There was a piece of towel attached to the car, held by the man in the wheelchair as he was pulled along. 'The incident went on for about three or four minutes. 'Security guards feared for the safety of customers who were still frequenting the store and feared for the safety of the man in the wheelchair. Scroll down for video . 'Stupid': Maria Adams, 20, was captured on CCTV recklessly dragging a friend around a car park in a borrowed Tesco wheelchair in Sunderland . 'He did not require a wheelchair, you see him get out and walk away unaided.'

"Scientists have finally answered the question: is there anybody there? A spooky experiment which conjured up a ghostly illusion in the laboratory has proved once and for all that it’s only our mind playing tricks. The invisible, creepy presence reported by so many people over the centuries is just a set of mixed-up signals in the brain. Scroll down for video . Artificial 'ghosts' have been conjured up by scientists in an experiment so spooky that two participants asked for it to stop. By having signals mixed up in their brains (shown), volunteers were made to feel that a creepy 'presence' was behind them. They counted up to four phantoms positioned where no-one was standing . The sensation was re-created by researchers using a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blindfolded volunteers. Two volunteers were so unnerved by the feeling of being surrounded by ghosts, they asked for the experiment to stop. They counted up to four phantoms positioned where no-one was standing - and touching their backs with invisible fingers. The illusion came from a programmed delay between the brain’s processing of the body’s movements and the body’s position in space. Whether we are alone in the universe is one of life’s unanswered questions. But a new poll suggests that the majority of us are convinced aliens exist, and that we're more likely to believe in little green men than God. According to the research, children in particular are so confident in the existence of extraterrestrial beings that they think family members are aliens in disguise. The poll of 2,000 adults and children was carried out by Ripley’s Believe It or Not! attraction in London. Each of the participants were asked to rate how strongly they believed in five supernatural or religious beings including aliens, ghosts, UFOs, angels and God. Ghosts topped the adult’s list on 55 per cent, followed by aliens on 51 per cent and UFOs on 42 per cent. God was at the bottom of their list of beliefs on 25 per cent, behind angels on 27 per cent. Children believed in aliens and ghosts equally (64 per cent), UFOs scored 50 per cent followed by God on 33 per cent. Angels were bottom of this group's list on 27 per cent. The interference in the brain was sufficient to make the volunteers believe the signals were no longer from their own bodies - but from someone else. The findings appear to explain the common experience people have of feeling an unseen presence, even a guardian angel, demon or apparition stalking their movements. These are frequently reported by people in extreme physical or emotional situations, such as mountaineers and explorers, or those grieving for a lost loved one. They are also associated with medical conditions that affect the brain, including epilepsy, migraine, schizophrenia and cancer. Professor Olaf Blanke, who led a team at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, says the research has given up the ghost to science. He said: ‘Our experiment induced the sensation of a foreign presence in the laboratory for the first time. It shows that it can arise under normal conditions, simply through conflicting sensory-motor signals. ‘The robotic system mimics the sensations of some patients with mental disorders or of healthy individuals under extreme circumstances. ‘This confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain.’ Here an unamed participant takes part in the experiment. The robot made humans feel the illusory presence of a non-existent 'ghost'. The study was conducted on 12 individuals with various neurological conditions such as epilepsy, stroke, migraine and tumours . The scientists re-created the ‘feelings of presence’ - known as FOP - using a slave robot device that allowed volunteers to control the movements of a jointed mechanical arm with their index fingers. The movements were translated to another robot arm behind them which touched their backs. When both the finger-pushing and back-touching occurred at the same time, it created the illusion that the volunteers were caressing their own backs. That felt weird enough to the blindfolded participants. But something a lot stranger happened when the back-touching was delayed and about 500 milliseconds out of sync with the finger movements. One in three of the volunteers felt as if they were being watched, and touched, by one or more ghostly presences. At the same time, they had the disconcerting sensation of drifting backwards, towards the unseen hand. When questioned, several reported a strong feeling of invisible people being close to them. On average, they counted two, with up to four being reported. Two of the 12 healthy participants were so disturbed by the experience that they asked the scientists to halt the experiment, the results of which appear in the journal Current Biology. The scientists say the experiment that what some people believe to be a ghostly presence is just a trick of the brain. ‘This confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain,' said Professor Olaf Blanke of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland . Co-author Dr Giulio Rognini, also from the EPFL, said: ‘Our brain possesses several representations of our body in space. Under normal conditions, it is able to assemble a unified self-perception of the self from these representations. ‘But when the system malfunctions because of disease - or, in this case, a robot - this can sometimes create a second representation of one’s own body, which is no longer perceived as ‘me’ but as someone else, a “presence”.’ The researchers describe in the journal the case of mountaineer, Reinhold Messner, who had an FOP experience while descending from the summit of the Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat in June, 1970. Accompanied by his brother, he was freezing, exhausted and oxygen-starved. He recalled becoming aware of a third climber 'descending with us, keeping a regular distance, a little to my right and a few steps away from me, just outside my field of vision'. Before conducting the experiment, the researchers carried out brain scans of 12 patients with neurological disorders who had encountered FOPs in the past. They identified disturbances in three specific brain regions, the insular cortex, parietal-frontal cortex, and temporo-parietal cortex. All were involved in self-awareness, movement, and sense of position in space.","Swiss researchers carried out an experiment to make artificial 'ghosts'

"Thousands of people are being paid sickness benefits because they are too fat to work – at a cost to the taxpayer of £54million. Shocking figures show welfare payments for claimants with obesity-related illnesses have more than doubled in five years – highlighting the crisis blighting Britain. Almost 12,000 people received Disability Living Allowance last year because they have metabolic disease - the medical term for a combination of obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. Scroll down for video . The number of people claiming benefits because they are too fat to work has more than doubled in five years . The Department for Work and Pensions statistics show that the number of claimants with the condition has more than doubled from around 5,500 five years ago. Obesity is also a massive burden on the NHS and costs the health service more than £9billion a year. Ministers have been accused of failing to take proper action against the food industry to help the public by cutting calories in food and drink, and to help people make healthier choices. Some DLA claimants have jobs but the vast majority are out of work. Recipients can receive up to £138 a week. Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘Successive governments have made life too easy for too many obese people. ‘If the obese have a legitimate cause for their fatness - and there may be medical or genetic reasons - benefits should not be denied to them. But getting long-term benefits simply for over-eating is an insult to society.’ Andy Silvester, from the Taxpayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘It’s crucial that every one of these claims is investigated to ensure it’s necessary.’ Julia Manning, from the think tank 2020health, said: ‘This obesity crisis in the West is a far worse health catastrophe than Ebola but there has been no government urgent action, even though we see the benefits bill spiralling.’ Iain Duncan Smith's department is spending £54million a year on sickness benefits for fat people . But Jill Tipping, of the obesity support charity HOOP UK, said: ‘Obese people have an addiction to food. It’s an illness.’ Nearly one in five British secondary school pupils and a quarter of adults are obese, according to officials figures. Health experts predict that by 2050 the annual bill for obestity-related illnessed will have risen to £50billion a year, with almost two-thirds of the population obese. In one extreme case, Paul Mason, 51, who was once known as the fattest man in the world, had to give up his job as a postman when he became too huge to complete his delivery rounds. Mr Mason, of Ipswich, used to weigh 70 stone but shed a whopping 48 stone after gastric band surgery and now tips the scales at 22 stone . At the height of his weight problems he ate about 20,000 calories a day, weighed 70 stone, and needed a specially-built bungalow provided for him by the council. When Mr Mason became ill, firefighters had to knock down a wall in his house and use a forklift truck to get him to hospital. The Government has vowed to cut the welfare bill and began phasing out Disability Living Allowance in April and replacing it with the new Personal Independence Payment. Ministers also launched a Call to Action campaign in October 2011 in a bid to tackle obesity and reduce the nation’s calorie intake by 2020. The drive has called on the food and drink industry to play a key role in slashing the nation’s calorie consumption and encouraging families to eat healthily and enjoy active lifestyles. But senior doctors and academics want the Government to force food manufacturers to cut sugar levels, ensure products are clearly labelled and impose a tax on soft drinks. Public Health England, the Department of Health agency responsible for tackling obesity, has said it would ‘consider’ the ideas as part of a nine-month consultation process that will eventually report to ministers next spring. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘Just having a metabolic disease in itself is unlikely to qualify for DLA. But they could qualify if they have a physical or mental disability caused or made worse by it.’","Benefits for overweight illnesses have more than doubled in five years .

"A vaccine found to be 100% effective in protecting monkeys from Ebola is to be rushed through human trials - after sitting unused on a lab shelf for ten years. The vaccine, known as VSV-EBOV, even had had its results published in a respected journal, and health officials called them exciting. However, it then languished on a lab shelf after being licensed to a drug firm - until now. Scroll down for video . Soldiers in Texas carrying out training in using protective suits. A radical 100% effective vaccine has just beguin human trials at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland . When a person takes a vaccine, it prompts their immune system to start making antibodies. Antibodies work in our body by finding and then neutralizing foreign objects such as bacteria or viruses. The experimental vaccine is based on an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that is combined with a portion of the protein covering of the Ebola virus. The Ebola Virus . When administered, it induces an immune response against the Ebola virus. Animal studies suggest that the experimental Ebola vaccine is very effective in helping prevent illness. Those same studies have shown that the vaccine can help to prevent illness if it is taken immediately after exposure to the Ebola virus. Studies already done in primates found that it prevents infection when given before exposure and increases survival chances when given after exposure. The intellectual property rights for the vaccine belong to the Government of Canada, and NewLink, a private company that owns the licensing rights to the vaccine, has the responsibility to produce mass quantities and to bring the vaccine to clinical trials. 'On October 13, 2014, the Government of Canada announced the start of clinical trials for the vaccine at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the United States,' the Canadian Health Agency said. 'These trials will provide critical information about the safety of the vaccine and appropriate dosage. 'Results from the clinical trial are expected in December 2014.' NewLink Genetics says at least five clinical trials involving the vaccine, known as VSV-EBOV, will soon be under way in the United States, Germany, Switzerland and in an unnamed African country which is not battling Ebola. The work stalled due to a lack on interest in Ebola, and because there were cases. 'There's never been a big market for Ebola vaccines,' Thomas W. Geisbert, an Ebola expert at the University of Texas and one of the developers of the vaccine, told the Boston Globe. 'So big pharma, who are they going to sell it to?' Geisbert said: 'It takes a crisis sometimes to get people talking. 'OK. We've got to do something here.' The vaccine was produced in Winnipeg by the Public Health Agency of Canada, and is the product of more than 10 years of scientific research by Public Health Agency of Canada scientists at the National Microbiology Laboratory. The Canadian government patented it, and 800 to 1,000 vials of the vaccine were produced. In 2010, it licensed the vaccine, known as VSV-EBOV, to NewLink Genetics, in Ames, Iowa. The Canadian government donated the existing vials to the World Health Organization, and safety tests of the vaccine in healthy volunteers have already begun. 'The Public Health Agency of Canada is supplying the vaccine to the WHO in its role as the international coordinating body for the Ebola outbreak, so that the vaccine can be made available as an international resource,' officials said. The Ebola vaccine on which Geisbert collaborated is made from another virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, which causes a mouth disease in cattle but rarely infects people. It had already been used successfully in making other vaccines. The researchers altered VSV by removing one of its genes — rendering the virus harmless — and inserting a gene from Ebola. The transplanted gene forces VSV to sprout Ebola proteins on its surface. The proteins cannot cause illness, but they provoke an immune response that in monkeys, considered a good surrogate for humans, fought off the disease. 'The WHO, in consultation with partners, including the health authorities from the affected countries, will guide and facilitate how the vaccine should be distributed and used. 'The remaining vials of the vaccine will be kept in Canada for further research and compassionate use as required.' The Ebola vaccine on which Geisbert collaborated is made from another virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, which causes a mouth disease in cattle but rarely infects people. Here, the ebola virus is shown in closeup . The research is part of a rush  of research to test drugs and vaccines is underway, with clinical trials starting for several candidates, including the vaccine produced nearly a decade ago. With no vaccines or proven drugs currently available, the stepped up efforts are a desperate measure to stop a disease that has defied traditional means of containing it.","Vaccine found to be 100% effective in protecting monkeys .

"A pharmaceuticals millionaire admitted in court Wednesday to killing her autistic 8-year-old son at a high-end Manhattan hotel, but told jurors she did not force drugs down his throat. Taking the stand in her murder trial, Gigi Jordan tearfully described a failed murder-suicide — one her defense has said was spurred by a mother's fears for her own life and her developmentally challenged son's future. ‘Did you give yourself and your son an amount of drugs that you believed would take your life and his?’ asked one of her attorneys, Allan Brenner. Mother's confession: Gigi Jordan, right, pictured in court in 2011 with her attorney Alan Dershowitz told jurors Wednesday that she gave her son a lethal dose of painkillers and didn't force them down his throat . ‘Yes, I did,’ Jordan said, her voice audibly shaking. But she denied the scenario prosecutors have painted: that she climbed on top of the comatose 8-year-old Jude Mirra, punched him in the nose, pried open his mouth by force and shoved a lethal dose of prescription medication down his throat with a syringe. ‘In doing so, did you ever jab your elbow into his chest… inject liquefied drugs into his mouth, forcibly then pinch his nose and cover his mouth to force him to swallow those drugs?” “No, I did not,’Jordan responded from the stand. Jude was found dead of a drug overdose and Jordan was found on the floor in room 1603, a $2,300-a-night suite at Manhattan's five-star Peninsula Hotel on February 5, 2010. More than 5,800 prescription pills, including anti-depressants, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs, were scattered around the room, prosecutors said, according to CNN. Some emergency responders have said they discovered Jordan incoherent; others described her as composed. By the time Jude was found inside the hotel room he had been dead for 8-14 hours. An autopsy revealed that the child was given a deadly cocktail of four painkiller and anti-inflammatory drugs, all washed down with Orange juice and vodka. Mother and son: Prosecutors maintain Jordan (right), 54, forced a cocktail of crushed pills and vodka with orange juice down the throat of her eight-year-old son, Jude Mirra (left), in a $2,300-a-night hotel suite . Standing trial: As Jude (right) lay dying on the bed next to her, Jordan (pictured, left, in court) then reportedly emailed adviser Patrick Walsh, saying: 'Hi Pat, can you please wire $125,000 to Bruce as requested below?' 'His fate was sealed,' prosecutor Matt Bogdanos said in opening statements. 'He didn't die fast. One by one, his vital organs shut down. It didn't take minutes. It took hours to die.' As he lay dying on the bed next to her, she then reportedly emailed adviser Patrick Walsh, saying: 'Hi Pat, can you please wire $125,000 to Bruce as requested below?'. She hoped to siphon the large sum of cash from her son's trust fund into one of her business accounts, prosecutors said in court last month. Jordan has always described her actions in the luxury hotel room on Fifth Avenue in February 2010 as a 'mercy killing,' but prosecutors said the pharmaceutical executive's emails contradicted her defense lawyer's assertions that she was 'emotionally distraught' at her son's autism. Instead, Jordan wanted to live the life of the socialite and not be tied down by a young son who required so much attention because of his condition, said lead prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos. The mother’s defense team have said she acted out of fear that her life was in danger and that her son would be left susceptible to abuse. Aim: Jordan hoped to siphon cash from her son's trust into one of her business accounts, prosecutors said . Scene of the crime: Although Jordan has never disputed feeding the drugs to Jude, she has described her actions in the luxury hotel room on Fifth Avenue as a 'mercy killing'. Above, the Peninsula hotel on Fifth Avenue . Prosecutors say that whatever her worries, they didn't justify killing the boy. ‘The only person he ever needed protection from was the one person he should have been able to rely on the most,’ Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bodganos said in an opening statement last month. Trained as a nurse, Jordan later launched companies that administer drugs to patients in their home. After making an estimated $40million, she left her career and traveled the country seeking medical answers for her son. A joyous boy until roughly his 18th month, he became a tormented child who didn't speak, made strange grimaces, and screamed and cried, she said. He was initially considered autistic, though doctors later diagnosed immune-system abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems, according to her court filings. Jordan said Wednesday that Jude wasn't autistic; instead, she has said, he was severely traumatized by being sexually abused by his biological father, a yoga teacher, in 2007. The man has denied it and has never been charged with any crime. Jordan asked various authorities to investigate but got nowhere — and she even once got taken instead to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, her lawyers say. She was released within days. Meanwhile, she came to believe that one of her ex-husbands, Ray Mirra, wanted her dead to keep her from disclosing certain shady business dealings involving black-market pill sales, her defense says. He has denied all her allegations and has sued her for slander. Afraid that Jude would be left unprotected against his father, she felt ending both their lives was the only way out, her lawyers have said.

"One in seven patients can no longer be helped by antibiotics because they are increasingly ineffective after being handed out too freely by GPs, it emerged last night. Experts warn that the deepening problem could be fatal for a significant number of Britons with common but potentially life-threatening infections. For some infections, the failure rate was one in three. Overall, it has increased by 12 per cent in 22 years as the number of prescriptions has steadily increased. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as this strain of E. coli are becoming more common (file picture) For infections such as pneumonia, which commonly affects the elderly, the consequences are fatal. Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer, has already warned the problem is so severe that routine hip operations, caesarean sections and even minor scratches could become deadly. It has been declared a public health crisis by the World Health Organisation. The issue has been caused by GPs prescribing antibiotics too readily, sometimes for viruses such as coughs and colds for which they are ineffective. Vets have also been using the medication too widely on animals. As a result, the bacteria that make humans ill have evolved to become resistant to treatments that used to kill them. Drug firms have also not produced more effective antibiotics because they are not deemed profitable. Researchers from the University of Cardiff looked at the records of almost 11 million patients prescribed antibiotics between 1991 and 2012 for sinusitis, sore throats, skin infections, bronchitis and pneumonia. For 15.4 per cent of patients given an antibiotic in 2012, it did not work. The failure rate was only 13.9 per cent in 1991. Doctors sometimes give out antibiotics as a catch-all when they are unsure whether an ill person is suffering from a virus, which cannot be treated with the drugs, or a bacterial infection (file picture) In cases of bronchitis and pneumonia – which can be deadly – this rate can be as high as 35 per cent, or one in three. Professor Craig Currie, of Cardiff University’s School of Medicine, said: ‘The growing ineffectiveness of antibiotics is very worrying. We need to minimise unnecessary or inappropriate treatment which could be fuelling microbial resistance to antibiotics, prolonging illness and in some cases killing people. ‘People are given antibiotics inappropriately. We can’t always test whether it’s due to a virus or bug, so antibiotics are a fallback.’ Dame Sally said: ‘The research shows the urgent need to develop new antibiotics, something this Government is looking to address through a review on anti-microbial resistance commissioned by the Prime Minister.’ The study also found that the number of patients given antibiotics had risen from 60 per cent in 1991 to 65 per cent in 2012. GPs cannot test whether a sore throat or a rash is caused by bacteria or a virus, which cannot be treated by antibiotics. But when put under pressure by patients they may prescribe them in the hope they will work. There are thought to be 25,000 deaths a year in Europe from infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: ‘Antibiotic resistance is one of the major global health concerns we face. ‘While it is not surprising that the amount of resistant infections has increased, the sheer numbers are of great concern.’ Not enough children are receiving vital vaccinations that protect against serious infections and illnesses. In the past year in England, 94.3 per cent of children who turned one were given the so-called five-in-one jabs to protect against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). This falls below the 95 per cent recommended by the World Health Organisation. The HSCIC’s latest statistics on immunisation also show that just 92.7 per cent of children reaching their second birthday had received the MMR jab, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. Even though this coverage is at its highest since the vaccine was introduced in 1988, England still remains below the WHO minimum of 95 per cent. HSCIC said coverage in England was below that of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for all routine childhood vaccines at the ages of one, two and five. Across the country, it was lowest in London.","Some bacteria that makes people ill has become resistant to antibiotics .

The family is still preparing its funeral plans for little Veronica, who was shot to death by Holmes during the midnight screening of the 'Dark Knight Rises'. It comes as the Century 16 movie theatre offered to pay for the funeral expenses for the victims' families, according to TMZ. Sources close to a mother of victim Rebecca Wingo told the website that Cinemark, which owns the cinema, called the chapel where her service was held and offered to pay for her funeral. The owner of the church said the company told him it would provide financial backing to all victims' families by paying any funeral expenses not covered by the Crime Victims' Compensation Fund, TMZ reported. Rebecca's mother, Shirley Wygal, turned down the offer and said the Victims Advocate Fund covered all expenses. Tears: Relatives and friends of victim Matt McQuinn mourn at the cemetery after his funeral on Saturday . Respects: McQuinn died protecting his girlfriend, who escaped with a shot wound to her knee . Pain: Mourners leave a memorial service for aspiring sportscaster Jessica Ghawi in Bulverde, Texas . Holmes is due back in court on Monday . where he will be formally charged with 12 counts of first-degree . murder. It is not known if he will face further charges for the death of . Ashley's unborn child. Tragically, just days ago, Ashley's boyfriend of two years Jamison Toews shared with CBS News in Denver the ultrasound of their unborn child, who had survived the shootings. He told them that the scan, which was taken on the day of the shooting showed everything to be fine. Toews . spoke of the night that Holmes burst into the theater and opened fire . ont he unwitting audience members, there to witness the third part of . the Batman series of films starring Christian Bale. 'Another bullet came and hit her right in the chest, right in front of me and she just feel right back down,' said Toews. He also described the harrowing moment he saw Veronica had been shot too. Tribute: The crosses erected near the site of the massacre in memory of James Holmes's 12 victims . Victims: A dozen crosses were put up in Aurora, Colorado as makeshift memorials to the victims of the shooting in the movie theatre . 'I saw what you never want to see and it was Veronica’s lifeless body lying there,' said Toews. Ashley . Moser, 25, was hit in the abdomen and twice in the throat when . ‘demonic’ James Holmes opened fire during a midnight premiere of the . film, The Dark Knight Rises, in Colorado. She was sitting next to her six-year-old daughter, Veronica Moser-Sullivan, who was one of 12 people killed by Holmes. Ms . Moser’s brother, Robert Sierra, told the Mail before today's tragic . news: ‘I don’t know how, but she still has the baby. Yesterday I was . told she had lost it and today it’s OK. It’s a miracle as she was shot . in the stomach.’ 'Killer': James Holmes is accused of shooting 12 people dead and injuring 58 more during a movie screening . Arrested: Holmes, pictured in a photograph from his time as a camp counselor, will appear in court again on Monday . It has been claimed that the . breakup of a relationship could have sent Holmes over the edge – the . first sign yet of a possible motive. Mr Sierra, 32, described Veronica as . an ‘angel who was ripped away from us for no reason’. He said: ‘Veronica . wanted to be a princess, everybody loved her. Her laughter was . infectious, when she laughed everybody laughed. ‘She was only young but she had ambitions and goals, she wanted to go to college. ‘She would have so much fun playing, all you would hear through the house was her laughing and giggling.’ When Ms Moser was told about Veronica's death, according to relatives, she burst into tears and screamed: 'I want to die.' 'All she's asking about, of course, is her daughter,' said Annie Dalton, who is Ashley Moser's aunt. Veronica Moser, 6, was killed and her mother Ashley was shot three times . Innocent: Veronica's mother Ashley, 25, was critically injured and is undergoing surgery for her wounds. She will likely suffer some degree of paralysis and she was recently accepted into law school . 'She took it very badly,' Jean Moser, Ashley Moser's grandmother, told the Boston Herald. 'I know she was shocked. '(Veronica) was a very delightful, lively little girl. She was very engaging. It’s a terrible, terrible tragedy.' Veronica was to start learning swimming lessons on Tuesday, said Dalton. 'She . was excited about life as she should be. She's a six-year-old girl. This is just a nightmare right now. It's a nightmare. Everything's . surreal. It's just surreal.' Salute: Airman 1st Class Andrew Zayatz salutes a cross with the name of Air Force member Jesse Childress at the memorial site for the people killed by the gunman . Mr Sierra added: 'We called her Pumpkin since she was young, because she wore a pumpkin outfit to her first Halloween party  and it just stuck. ‘Veronica loved to dance, she loved to swim. She loved fairies and unicorns and she used to love dressing up and messing around in her mum’s high heels.' Aurora police chief Dan Oates indicated one motive for Holmes to carry out what Colorado . governor John Hickenlooper called a ‘diabolical, demonic’ act. Mr Oates . said: ‘I’ve heard one morsel of information about a relationship that . may or may not be true.’ Holmes, 24, is being held in the . Arapahoe County jail on a charge of first-degree murder, where he . reportedly has shown no remorse and ‘thinks he is in a movie’. The neuroscience graduate is said to have spent months planning his attack with ‘calculation and deliberation’. Police say he ordered 6,000 rounds of . ammunition and bought four guns before donning riot gear and a gas mask . and opening fire at the Century 16 cinema in Aurora shortly after . midnight on Friday morning. Massacre: 12 people were left dead and 58 injured in the Colorado shooting . Crime scene: Bystanders gathered at the site of the shooting in the aftermath . The massacre could have been even worse. His A-15 assault rifle jammed, meaning he had to switch to a less powerful weapon. Asked about Holmes, Mr Sierra was . barely able to contain his anger. He said: ‘Even if he got the death . sentence it would not bring Veronica back. We will miss her so much. ‘I have nothing good to say about him. They should have shot him on sight. Who would want to keep somebody . alive who does something like that?’ Investigators are continuing to examine Holmes’s apartment, having disabled the 30 bombs he set up to kill police. He had hoped to lure officers to his flat by setting a timer to play loud music as he was carrying out his rampage.

"A haunted house company in northern California has been forced to change the serial killer theme of one of their attractions after offending families whose loved ones were brutally murdered by the real-life criminal. Scream Park California based one of their haunted houses this year off the 1970s Sacramento murderer Richard Trenton Chase, who killed six people in the span of just one month.

Scream Park have now changed the theme after the families of Chase's victims came forward to express their outrage in posts on Facebook. David Wallin was one person who criticized the house, in honor of his wife Teresa, who was savagely murdered by Chase in her home while carrying their unborn baby. Mr Wallin was sadly the person who discovered her body. 'It's horrifying that everybody else somehow is making some kind of situation, money, whatever you want to call it, off of other people's grief,' he told CBS Sacramento.

"French prime minister Manuel Valls (pictured) has hit back at criticism of his country by John Lewis boss Andy Street . The French prime minister has hit back at stinging criticism of his country by John Lewis boss Andy Street - by suggesting the department boss was drunk. Mr Street said last week that France was 'hopeless and downbeat' and described the Paris train station Gare du Nord as 'the squalor pit of Europe'. But during a visit to Britain, French premier Manuel Valls described the remarks as 'absurd' and suggested the retail boss had 'drunk too much beer'. Mr Street has since apologised for last week's comments, in which he urged those with investments there to 'get them out quickly' On an official visit to the UK, during which he met David Cameron, Mr Valls lambasted the British trait of 'French bashing', which he described as 'not particularly pleasant'. Singling out Mr Street - though refusing to name him - the French prime minister said: 'This business leader has had to apologise. He made some absurd statements. 'Perhaps he’d drunk too much beer. He announced an investment in France and then said France is finished. 'One has to show a bit of respect.' But he did acknowledge the light-hearted nature of the John Lewis boss's attack. Mr Street's comments, at an event marking the end of a John Lewis competition for start-ups, came after he had been in Paris to collect an award for the business at the World Retail Congress. He said: 'You get on Eurostar from something I can only describe as the squalor pit of Europe, Gare du Nord, and you get off at a modern, forward-looking station [St Pancras]. ‘I have never been to a country more ill at ease… nothing works and worse, nobody cares about it.’ Mr Street also said that the award he had been given was 'made of plastic and is frankly revolting'. 'If I needed any further evidence of a country in decline, here it is. Every time I [see it], I shall think, God help France. Andy Street (pictured) said last week that France was 'finished' and urged those with investments there to 'get them out quickly'. 'If you've got any investments in French business, get them out quickly.' But after the remarks were publicised, the 50-year-old Oxford graduate, who joined John Lewis from university 30 years ago, was forced to backtrack in a statement issued by John Lewis. He said: 'The remarks I made were supposed to be lighthearted views, and tongue in cheek. On reflection I clearly went too far. 'I regret the comments, and apologise unreservedly.' But the apology came too late to avoid a response from the French embassy, which said: ‘France is the fifth biggest economy in the world... so obviously many foreign businesses do not seem to share Mr Street’s view.’ France is John Lewis' second biggest market and it is about to open a French website. The graph shows the sales figures for the week ending September 27 for John Lewis, which shows that it was 15 per cent ahead of last year - the retail giant now turns over more than Marks and Spencer . City grandee Lord Levene said Mr Street’s comments were ‘very silly’ and ‘mindless’. The high profile businessman and former Lord Mayor of London added: ‘It’s completely inappropriate for someone running a big company to do this. It doesn’t matter whether the criticism is right or wrong.’ But Mr Street’s comments struck a chord with some in the business community, who believe the 75 per cent tax on top earners introduced by Socialist president Francois Hollande and the country’s labour laws – including a 35-hour week – have stunted the economy. This morning John Lewis said it would be making no further comment on the matter.","John Lewis managing director Andy Street had said France was 'hopeless and down beat'

"Smiling for the camera as they enjoy a drink in a bar with friends, these are the backpackers Hannah Witheridge and David Miller just hours before they were murdered on a Thai holiday island. The picture was taken by another backpacker in a sports club in Kah Tao at 9.45pm. Just nine hours later, they were discovered dead. Thai police have yet to make any arrests for their murder, and have warned of a Mafia-like code of silence on the island. Scroll down for video . Hannah Witheridge, far left, and David Miller, second right, pictured together with a group in a bar in Kah Tao, just hours before they were brutally murdered . The picture shows both backpackers together with a group of people at a sports pub on Kah Tao, the night before they were murdered. It shows 23-year-old Miss Witheridge on the far left wearing a pink top, holding a cocktail, smiling at the camera. While Mr Miller, 24 can be seen second from the right in a grey-coloured T-shirt, also smiling for the photograph. Others in the group at the Choppers pub also appear in high spirits, with one girl giving a thumbs up towards the camera. However, early the next morning and just hours after the photo was taken, the bodies of the pair were found mutilated on Sairee beach on the island after they were bludgeoned to death with a garden hoe. It is thought that the pair did not know each other when they arrived at the bar with separate groups of friends and that they also left the pub separately. The picture comes after claims the British pair may have been arguing with a local gangster before they were murdered last week. Thai police have so far failed to produce a credible suspect after changing their line of investigation several times. There have been claims that Miss Witheridge, left, and Mr Miller, right had argued with a local gangster before they were murdered last week . Now it has emerged that Thailand's government has deployed a security team to the island to crackdown on mafia-type behaviour. According to the Bangkok Post, it comes amid fears that a number of influential people were involved in the murder of the backpackers. The Nation newspaper also added that the security team will target rackets and illegitimate businesses on Kah Tao, as well as punishing soldiers and police who 'patronise these people or activities.' The news comes as police said on Tuesday that were they are close to arresting 'more than one' suspect. Police have been taking DNA swabs and footprints of people on the island in a bid to find the killers of the British pair . It is believed that Thai Police were to force every man on the island to take a DNA test as part of the investigation . Police Lieut-General Panya Mamen said all suspects had been questioned and two had been singled out. 'We are now confident we have the evidence about who are the murderers,' he said. 'I am confident they will be arrested and charged this week.' It was also reported Thai police were to force every man on the island to take a DNA test. Initial tests show DNA samples found on the bodies almost certainly came from two Asian men, though detectives have now said that they now believe at least three people were involved in the attack. A police diver searches clues close to where the pair's bodies were found. Local police have come under fire for their handling of the case . Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller were found bludgeoned to death with a garden hoe close to this spot in Kah Tao . Thai police said they 'still believe sexual jealousy is at the heart of this crime'. Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller were found bludgeoned to death on Sairee beach on September 15. Police had said their prime suspect was a fisherman who had already fled the island on a private boat. However, police have come under fire for their handling of the case which critics say has descended into chaos. Local media in particular have turned on their force, claiming its incompetence stretches way beyond this investigation.","Picture shows Hannah Witheridge and David Miller hours before their deaths .

"By JAN MOIR FOR THE DAILY MAIL . On the last day of London Fashion Week, a revolution of sorts took place. For the first time ever, plus-sized clothes were shown on the catwalk. You heard me right, sister. Fashion for fat birds, being paraded as if it was something to be proud of, rather than a collection of sludge-coloured, tent-sized garments to be hidden away in a dusty corner of a department store, never to be spoken of again. Here, there were togs for the tubs, dresses for the messes; most of them bright, floaty, lovely things that a woman of a certain size and age might actually want to buy and try. Rather than buy and cry over because there was nothing else in the shop that fitted her, except a hideous tarpaulin that once might have kept a van dry in the rain but was now masquerading as a party frock. Or perhaps that was just me? Catwalk revolution: Looks from the Evans show in London this week proving plus size clothes can be colourful and fashionable . On the catwalk for High Street brand Evans' inaugural show, models in silver sandals and peep-toe booties showed cleverly cut bustiers with matching palazzo pants; plissé dresses in fondant colours; wafty cardigans that floated down to the floor; lots of lovely shifts with sequinned straps; a metallic, pleated skirt that fluttered like gossamer and oyster satin blouses, alongside a number of hugely flattering, all-terrain, bulge-bustin', hip-skimming skirts and dresses. True, there were some frocky horrors, too, but the Design Collective for Evans was a clever collaboration between six high-end designers and the plus-size specialists, which will be in shops next spring. In an innovative and mutually beneficial association, the fashion teams reworked designs from their own collections into plus sizes using the Evans in-house expertise. Successful plus size is all about sculpting and cutting, not just adding more and more fabric and hoping for the best - although tragically, that seems to have been the template for about half a century. The new designs from Clements Ribeiro, Vita Gottlieb, Giles Deacon, Hema Kaul, Lulu Liu and Jamie Wei Huang use an enticing range of fabrics and really are fresh and covetable. Well, almost all of them. I can’t be the only blub tub who is not quite ready for a laser-cut silver pleather skirt, or a bright green evening gown or getting my belly button out, as some of the two-piece combos and slash front tops encourage. Shape specialists: Evans have taken the latest trends and made them flatter larger women . Bold and beautiful: Some more of the Evans collection on the catwalk including sequin embellished tops and floaty skirts . The show was the brainchild of clothing magnate Sir Philip Green, whose Arcadia empire owns Evans along with Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and other High Street - please don't take this personally, ladies - giants. Green staged the show at the Freemasons' Hall in Covent Garden on Tuesday evening, just as Fashion Week ground to a close for another season. Inside the hall, the fashion Press packed on to white benches to see, with their very own eyes, perhaps for the first time, what anything above a size six might look like. As the lights dimmed, the atmosphere was similar to those Victorian freak shows, when crowds gathered, consumed with equal parts revulsion and fascination, to view bearded ladies and midgets or perhaps a combination of both. On the front rows, there was a noticeable lack of the kind of high-velocity celebrity big names that have garlanded other fashion shows this week. No Kate Moss, no Cara or Poppy Delevingne, no Downton Abbey girls, no Alexa Chung, for no big (famewise, not shapewise) star ever wants to be associated with the taint of tub; the fashion world equivalent of the black spot. There was not even a glimpse of Katie Hopkins, the fat-shaming, burger-munching controversialist who has put on four stone to show fatsos how simple it is to lose it again. You'd think she could have had the decency to come and heckle, or to throw chocolate biscuits at the models. Who, it must be said, didn't look much over a size 16 anyway. And in the UK, that is an average size, not a plus size. For the more daring: Crops tops and belly button flashing outfits . Meeting demand: The Evans show was the brainchild of clothing magnate Sir Philip Green who hopes it was the first of many at London Fashion Week . Those who did turn up for this momentous moment in the calendar of chub include swimwear designer Kimberley Garner and Tamsin Outhwaite - but she'd go to the opening of a powder compact. Still, she crossed her slim ankles and tried to look interested. The models were traditionally grim-faced and everyone sipped water in that oddly self-important way. Apart from that, we were in uncharted waters, with shapely women sporting busts, curves and even the occasional cankle on the catwalk. Why is this deemed so unusual? Perhaps it is because fashion and fat, like a squirt of astringent lemon on to a pool of double cream, have always separated and reacted badly to each other. They are natural enemies, not allies. Since for ever, fashion has been designed exclusively for tiny, doll-girl women with rosebud breasts and chihuahua hips. The rest of us have just had to suffer in silence, while wearing rather too many jersey separates in various shades of Gloom and Depressed, kidding ourselves that a glimpse of chiffon shirt tail takes about a stone off and no one will notice we’re overweight if we wear noir layers and a jaunty scarf. Star support: Tamzin Outhwaite was on the front row for the Evans show . Well, according to our new saviour Philip Green, those dark days are over. After his plus-size show, he said: 'You cannot ignore the [plus-size] market place. And you can't be defensive about it, or apologise about it. Why should the category be any different from petite?' Why indeed? A cynic might suppose that plus fashion was never economically viable before, but now that so much of the population is so overweight, all of a sudden the numbers add up. For decades, High Street plus fashion has been - with a few honourable exceptions - not much more than a jumble sale of shapeless cardies and endless black leggings. Fat fashion didn't have a season or a theme or a message, it was just a sea of black polyester from spring to spring, an ocean of baggy sacks and waterfall cardigans and peasant smocks that no peasant would ever willingly wear, . 45 per cent of British women are size 16 or over, yet the bestselling dress size is a 12, followed by a 14 . Nice clothes and pretty things? They were for the thin girls. The looks we had to choose between were limited and brutal, including Town Hall In Tights, Leopard Print Barrage Balloon, Hattie Jacques Special, Godzilla Secretary, Mad Granny, and my personal standby, The Black Cube. Yet when I visited the Evans flagship store in London's Oxford Street this week, it was clear that change was in the air. Yes, there are still yards of black leggings and all-weather wraps, but Evans has quietly rebranded itself as 'shape specialists' who 'embrace the curve' in a shop that sells 'reworked designs for fuller-figured ladies.' Items given pride of place include dresses from designers such as Scarlett & Jo and Lovedrobe, with prices ranging from around £30 to £70. There are also cheery assistants who are knowledgeable, helpful and encouraging. They know that if anyone is going to have a plus-size breakdown in the changing room it is going to be us. A wonderful lady called Daisy encouraged me to try a pansy print frock that I would have run a mile from, but which actually looked very... nice. Back at the show, Green suggested that Evans, which has more than 180 stores in the UK and Ireland, may even have a catwalk show every season. 'This is day one,' he said. So is it just a gimmick or genuine change? Eyeing up a lovely Vita Gottlieb purple dress on the catwalk, the one with the scarlet ribbons and divine neckline, I do hope, hope, hope it is the former.

"Final steps: Kellie Maloney, pictured yesterday, will undergo breast and genitalia surgery in January . Kellie Maloney, formerly known as boxing promoter Frank Maloney, was this week told that doctors plan to carry out the operations that will complete her transformation from a man to a woman early next year. Maloney, who has three daughters from two marriages, is now 18 months into the transition period - learning to live as a different gender. And she revealed today that she has just one final consultation with doctors before her final operation is booked for January 13. The mother-of-three was with her eldest daughter Emma, 32, when she found out on Wednesday that doctors had the date set aside for her genital and breast surgery. Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery. Private clinics recommend one year to ensure that their patients can cope with the change. Kellie has already received hormone therapy, hours of hair removal electrolysis, voice coaching and counselling. She will now have an operation that will involve 'the realignment of her male genitalia to become female genitalia' as well as having breast implants - which doctors said could be up to a B or a C cup. The procedures will leave Kellie bed-bound for 10 days and require a further 12-week recovery period. But the 60-year-old insists that she is not nervous about undergoing the painful procedures, saying that it is something she has 'always wanted'. She told the Daily Mirror: 'As soon as I get out of that bed, I'm going to look in a full-length mirror at myself and for the first time ever, I will see the person I should have been all my life staring back at me'. Scroll down for video . She added: 'When I was born, the midwife just got me wrong. If you're born without an arm or a leg, you can have it medically corrected. I was born with the wrong body to match my brain.' The January surgery, which Kellie has chosen to have done at a private clinic, will come after more plastic surgery to her face next month. Sharing her plans yesterday on Lorraine, Kellie revealed that she's having an operation in Belgium to have her nose made slightly smaller. Private: Kellie, pictured with daughter Sophie yesterday, said that she wants to be alone when she sees her body for the first time after her surgery in January. She will have the procedure done at a private clinic . Close: Kellie Maloney revealed yesterday that her stint on Celebrity Big Brother led to her daughters Sophie, right, and Lilly, left, to having a greater understanding and acceptance of her new life as a woman . Strong: The procedures will leave Kellie bed-bound for 10 days and require a further 12-week recovery period.But the 60-year-old insists that she is not nervous about undergoing the painful procedures . She said: 'My youngest daughter told me my nostrils were too big. 'I was always concerned about my chin but they tell me it's within the female parameters and the gender doctor can do the full operation, hopefully, and breasts in January.' Kellie, who has been married twice, shocked the sports world - and her family - when she announced that she had embarked on a new life as a woman. But the news, as well as her appearance on Celebrity Big Brother, led to greater understanding from her estranged daughters - so much so, that they now want her back in their lives on a daily basis after a two-year rift. However Kellie said that she wanted to be alone for the moment that she sees her new body for the first time. She added: 'I want that moment to be personal and private'. The former boxing manager, who guided Lennox Lewis to the world heavyweight title, retired in October – claiming she had fallen out of love with the sport. But yesterday even revealed that she's toying with the idea of getting back into boxing to prove that women can do it too.

"The Metropolitan Police will pay more than £400,000 in compensation to a woman who had a child by an undercover officer, it was claimed today. The woman, known only as Jacqui, has a son with Bob Lambert, who was revealed in 2012 as a member of the now-defunct Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) which placed officers in deep-cover roles between 1968 and 2008. She was one of several women taking High Court action against the Met over the actions of officers like Lambert, whom she knew as ‘Bob Robinson’ when a young activist in the 1980s. Undercover officer: The woman has a son with Bob Lambert (above), who was revealed in 2012 as a member of the now-defunct Special Demonstration Squad . Jacqui is reportedly to receive £425,000 and in an interview with the Guardian and the BBC, she said she had been receiving psychiatric care after learning of his real identity as a police officer who was married with children. She said: ‘The legal case is finished but there is no closure for me. There is the money, but there is no admission by the police that what they did was wrong, there is no meaningful apology and most importantly there are no answers.’ ‘I don't know why I was singled out by the police to be duped into an intimate sexual relationship with Bob Lambert. ‘I don't know if he was paid overtime to be with me during the 14 hours of labour I went through giving birth to our son. I feel violated.’ In August four former SDS officers were told they faced no criminal charges for their actions. The Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to charge four officers with sexual misconduct offences. The Met was previously forced to name two officers who allegedly had relationships with women activists in groups they infiltrated after High Court judge Mr Justice Bean ruled the force could not use its policy of ‘neither confirm nor deny’ (NCND) in response to the damages claims. Known as 'Bob Robinson': The woman said she had been receiving psychiatric care after learning of Bob Lambert's real identity as a police officer who was married with children . Scotland Yard: The woman was one of several women taking High Court action against the Metropolitan Police over the actions of officers like Lambert . As a result, the force confirmed Jim Boyling and Bob Lambert were undercover police officers. Request: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (pictured), the Met commissioner, has been told by the woman's lawyer that he should publicly condemn the practice of undercover officers having sexual relationships . Jules Carey, Jacqui's lawyer, told the Guardian and BBC that Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Met commissioner, should publicly condemn the practice of undercover officers having sexual relationships. Mr Carey told them: ‘The Metropolitan Police are prepared to criticise the conduct of an individual officer, Bob Lambert. They are even prepared to be critical of the unit he was from - but they refuse to condemn the practice itself. ‘It is time for the commissioner of Metropolitan Police to publicly commit to seeing the end of this shameful and abusive practice’. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the force ‘unreservedly apologises for any pain and suffering that the relationship with Bob Lambert, an undercover officer, has had on this woman’ but said that it had ‘never had a policy that officers can use sexual relations for the purposes of policing’. He said: ‘We recognise the impact that the revelation that he was an undercover police officer must have had both on her and her son. From the outset we have dealt with this lengthy case with professionalism and sensitivity, completely understanding the gravity of the circumstances. We regret if this necessarily complex process has added to her distress. ‘We want to be, and have tried hard to be, as open as we possibly can. Arguing the need to maintain the policy of neither confirm nor deny in relation to undercover operations has never been a refusal to accept wrongdoing, but has been done solely to protect a vital policing tactic.' Fathering a child while working undercover proved no barrier to Bob Lambert’s successful 30-year career with the Met Police. In fact, after five years spent infiltrating Left-wing groups in the 1980s he was promoted to oversee more junior members of the notorious Special Demonstration Squad. Over the next two decades he became an expert in combating Islamic and Right-wing extremism. He was even awarded an MBE in 2008 for ‘services to police work’ after retiring into academia. When Jacqui, the mother of Lambert’s child, recognised him in a report on the undercover policing scandal, she managed to track him down to St Andrews University. He was reunited with his son, now in his 20s, and Jacqui learned Lambert’s other two children had died from a genetic heart defect – which thankfully, their son does not share. Fighting back tears yesterday, Jacqui said she has become friends with Lambert and his second wife. Describing their first conversation on the phone, she said: ‘I had not spoken to him since he walked out on me but I instantly knew it was him.’ Lambert now works as a lecturer in terrorism studies at St Andrews and is a part-time senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University. He was also co-director of the European Muslim Research Centre at Exeter University for several years. He is soon to publish a book on Anders Breivik, who killed more than 70 people in Norway in 2011.","'Jacqui' has son with Special Demonstration Squad member Bob Lambert .

"Ginger jihadist Abdullah Elmir could face 25 years in jail if he ever sets foot on Australian soil again. The Australian Federal Police have confirmed the evidence is being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions after the Sydney teenager appeared in the ISIS video rant against western society, according to the Herald Sun. The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video this week. Scroll down for video . Abu Khaled from Australia, thought to be Abdullah Elmir, speaks flanked by other ISIS fighters in the latest ISIS propaganda video . AFP counterterrorism head Neil Gaughan told the Herald Sun that Elmir, who now goes by the moniker Abu Khaled, has 'basically admitted he is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation'. 'The fact that he is admitting that he is a member of ISIS, which he does in the video, straight away says that he has committed an offence under the criminal code. That’s up to 25 years imprisonment,' he said. Meanwhile, the father of the 17-year-old, known as 'Fayez', who accompanied Elmir to the Middle East said his son is 'back on the right path' and has returned to school in Sydney to sit his HSC exams, according to Herald Sun. The father of the 17-year-old, known as 'Fayez', who accompanied Elmir to the Middle East said his son is 'back on the right path' and has returned to school in Sydney to sit his HSC exams . While Elmir's friends have admitted that  Elmir,  who this week appeared in a YouTube video rant, was 'expected' to run away to the Middle East. 'Some expected it, like he used to talk about it a bit,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia. Distraught classmates from Condell Park High School, in Sydney's south-west, painted a picture of a complex young man on Thursday, describing him as both 'very quiet' and someone who 'enjoyed politicking'. Australian security agencies are analysing the vision to determine whether a bearded man to Elmir's right is Mohamed Elomar, (one of the country's most wanted) the ISIS recruit believed responsible for radicalising and luring dozens of Australians to take up arms in the Middle East. While most of his best mates either closed ranks behind him or were too upset to speak, one of his childhood friends admitted to being in a state of shock. 'Yeah man, he's my friend and I don't want to talk about him,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was my mate but I don't talk about him'. But the teenage terrorist was described by another classmate as being 'very quiet, he was a good kid, we used to pray together at our mosque'. While most of his closest mates either closed ranks behind him or were too upset to speak, one of his childhood friends admitted to being in a state of shock . Distraught classmates from Condell Park High School, in Sydney's south-west, painted a picture of a complex young man on Thursday, describing him as both 'very quiet' while also someone who 'enjoyed politicking' 'He did a little bit of debating here, he liked knowing politics and did some politicking but he was mostly very quiet and never, ever got into trouble,' he said. 'Abdullah was in theatre groups at school and he liked playing basketball a lot.' When asked if he was one of those who thought Abdullah was capable of running away, he added 'no, no I didn't expect that but I know a few of his other friends say they heard him mention it'. Professor Greg Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, said Elmir was recruited by another wanted terrorist, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, an Australian based in Syria. He said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators. He said the boy appeared as a 'pawn in the machine' in the chilling video. 'He thinks he's the star ... but the reality is, his new friends have got him a one-way ticket,' Professor Barton said. 'He's not in charge of his own destiny at all, he's being used.' Professor Barton added that young people were the easiest to radicalise. Bearded ISIS fighters, holding rifles, flank the Australian jihadi as he preaches hate . 'Teenagers, 20-somethings, particularly young men more than young women, are vulnerable to making rash judgments,' he said. 'They tend to be more rebellious toward [older] generations and sceptical of establishment figures.' It is believed former Kings Cross bouncer Baryalei, 33, recruited Elmir through western Sydney street preaching group Parramatta Street Dawah. 'He's said to have recruited 30 plus young people - mostly in western Sydney through Street Dawah,' Prof Barton said. Before Elmir joined ISIS, the ginger jihad was employed as a butcher in a shop in Bankstown, The Daily Telegraph. 'He made his own bed now he has to lie in it,' his former boss said. 'He was a good kid. The best kid.' Elmir's boss was furious when the 17-year-old called in sick, the same day Elmir reportedly told his mother that he was 'going fishing' and disappeared from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west, in June. Elmir and his friend Feiz are believed to have made their way to Syria and Iraq after crossing the border from Turkey, where they were last known to have contacted family members. They travelled via Perth, with stops in Malaysia and Thailand. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the 1.43 minutes long video is full of threats against the west . As Elmir finishes his diatribe the men all cheer and chant in Arabic . Elmir begins the video by saying 'this message I deliver to you the people of America, this message I deliver to you the people of Britain and this message I deliver especially to you the people of Australia'. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the video which is 1.43 minutes long is full of heavily worded threats and taunts the US-led coalition that recently began air strikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq. 'I say this about your coalition: you threaten us with your countries, bring every nation that you wish to us, bring every nation that you want to come and fight us. Whether it's 50 nations or 50 thousand nations it means nothing to us,' Elmir says. Reading from a script, a black and white scarf wrapped around his head and a huge rifle in his hand, he warns: 'Bring your planes bring everything you want to use because it will not harm us because we have Allah which is something you do not have.' Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf is wanted by the Federal Police for his activities in Syria . Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar posted photos of himself holding up decapitated heads on Twitter . A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: 'This video again highlights the threat posed by ISIL.' 'As the Prime Minister has said on many occasions, ISIL is a threat that reaches out to Australia and our allies and partners.' Elmir's family told the Sydney Morning Herald in June they were devastated their son had been 'brainwashed'. His family's lawyer Zali Burrows told the Australian Associated Press: 'The family went to the media today as a plea to the government to bring their boy back. 'We know they have the intelligence to pinpoint him. 'The concern is that he's being used as a tracking device to gather further intelligence, to see where he's actually going to go.' Ms Burrows questioned how Elmir was not stopped by Federal Police, who were thought to be monitoring him. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced Australia will send its special forces into Iraq to fight against Islamic State. Elmir's video was published one day after the announcement.","Ginger jihadist Abdullah Elmir could face 25 years in jail if he ever sets foot on Australian soil again .

"Andrew Sadler - who taught French at Rurik Jutting's £6,600-a-term boarding school in Worcestershire in the 1990s - is today revealed by the Mail as a convicted sex offender who was caught in bed with two child prostitutes in Romania . A teacher at 'psycho' banker Rurik Jutting’s prep school is a convicted sex offender who was caught in bed with two child prostitutes, it can be revealed today. Andrew Sadler, who taught French at £6,600-a-term Abberley Hall in Worcestershire when Jutting was a pupil there in the early 1990s, was also a key member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE). Jutting is accused of slaughtering two prostitutes in Hong Kong last week in an unexplained act of savagery. Later jailed in Romania for sexually assaulting boys, Sadler was described as the ‘quartermaster’ of PIE – the vile web of paedophiles that at one stage was linked to three of Labour’s most senior figures, including deputy leader Harriet Harman. It was his ‘job’ within PIE to help co-ordinate other abusers in their ceaseless search for the world’s most vulnerable children. Sadler – who was caught in bed with two child prostitutes in Romania - also ran the Colts football team at Abberley. Police believe Sadler – who confessed to a colleague of having ‘sex with hundreds and hundreds’ of boys – was an associate of PIE leaders including its treasurer Charles Napier and founder-member Morris Fraser. PIE, which in the 1970s lobbied for sex between adults and children to be decriminalised, helped paedophiles to secretly pass around their young victims. By the time Sadler quit teaching in 1995, Jutting, then aged ten, had been a boarder at Abberley for two years. Sadler was never charged with abusing any children at Abberley and there has been no suggestion that Jutting was among his victims. Sadler was reported to police in 1995 and took ‘early retirement’ from the historic school, which counts Lord (Geoffrey) Howe among its former pupils. In 2000, when Sadler was imprisoned for four years in Romania, his sickening double-life was finally exposed. British police who helped the Romanians convict him described Sadler as a key member of a network of public school paedophiles. Blue-eyed Sadler, 64, who now lives 100 yards from another prep school, told the Mail last night: ‘Yes, I was a teacher at Abberley, but I don’t know [Jutting]. I didn’t teach him and I don’t recognise him from the photograph.’ Asked about his paedophile activities, he said: ‘It has all been a terrible misunderstanding. I have been fighting to clear my name for 14 years. 'I am the subject of a SOPO [Sexual Offences Prevention Order] which prevents me from associating with boys under 18 and I have to notify the police if I leave the country.’ Lifestyle: Former public schoolboy and Cambridge graduate Rurik Jutting dated a string of beautiful Asian girls. He is accused of slaughtering two prostitutes in Hong Kong last week in an unexplained act of savagery . These photos show Rurik Jutting while he was a pupil at the £34,000-a-year boarding school, Winchester College. One photo was published in the 2000-2001 yearbook while the other featured in the 2002-2003 edition . He said he had previously visited other countries including Hong Kong, adding: ‘I have been to all over that part of the world as a teacher. 'There is a lot of poverty, which is why a lot of these girls go into prostitution - I have to say with their parents’ knowledge.’ Sadler was convicted of having sex with a 14-year-old boy and engaging in an obscene act in the presence of a juvenile at a court in Bucharest in 2000. He spent 16 months of a four-year sentence in jail in Romania before being deported back to Britain on medical grounds. In 2007, he then breached an interim court order not to have children under 18 at his home after he allowed a 15-year-old to smoke cannabis, drink beer and stay overnight. Worcester Crown Court heard Sadler had employed an 18-year-old gardener who brought the youth along to his house. In a failed attempt to appeal the ban, Sadler maintained he was only 'helping' a vulnerable boy who was having problems with his parents, it was reported by Worcester News at the time. From angelic schoolboy to bloated 'zombie' banker: Rurik Jutting pictured aged six at Wallop Preparatory School in Weybridge, Surrey in 1990 (left) and (right) while working as an investment trader in Hong Kong . 'Not he most popular kid in the school': A former classmate at Wallop Preparatory School in Weybridge, Surrey said Jutting (second right, middle row) was 'a bit of a strange chap' in his days at the school . British banker Rurik Jutting  is driven to court in Hong Kong following a holding charge of two counts of murder . Sadler had claimed the order was 'unjust' telling the court: 'I have never gone near a child in my life. 'I’m not a paedophile and think the whole subject is abhorrent. I was helping the boy purely out of compassion.' Quashing his appeal, Judge Andrew Geddes said: 'It is highly probable the boy was at his home to be groomed for sexual ventures. It is a very similar situation to the one in Romania.' Sadler was subsequently given a full SOPO that also banned him from working with children under 16. Speaking to the Mail yesterday, Michael Haggard, former headmaster of Abberley Hall school, said: ‘There was never any suggestion that Sadler had done anything wrong while at the school. 'I have no reason to think that anything happened.’ He described Jutting as ‘a highly intelligent and respected chap’, adding: ‘He excelled in academics but he also did a lot of other things. 'He played musical instruments and was in lots of sport teams. He got on well with his peers and teachers. 'He was very intelligent and got a scholarship to Winchester College, which is not a terribly easy thing to do.’ Police in Hong Kong are expected to carry out a video reconstruction of the alleged murders at Cambridge-educated Jutting’s high-rise apartment in the near future. The former Merrill Lynch banker has been asked to take part in the exercise, ahead of his next court appearance on Monday. Sumarti Ningshi, a mother-of-one from Indonesia, was killed and stuffed into a suitcase at Jutting's flat . 'Can still feel her presence': Seneng  in a photograph from the family album. Her parents said she 'a lovely girl' who always helped around the house when she was still at school and later on the family's coconut plantation . Seneng, also known as Jesse Lorena (pictured posing with cash) was found by police with her throat slashed at Jutting's apartment . Yesterday, it was claimed that just hours after allegedly butchering his first victim, Jutting went for a pint of beer at a local pub where he had previously told staff and drinkers he was ‘a psychopath’. Police believe he chopped up Sumarti Ningshi, a 25-year-old mother-of-one from Indonesia, on October 27 before stuffing her ‘almost decapitated’ body into a suitcase. Jutting is then said to have arrived at the Old China Hand pub in the Wan Chai red light district between 10pm and midnight that day. A member of staff said he came in and ordered a pint of Tetley’s. He added Jutting – whose email out-of-office reply read: ‘Please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath’ – revealed he had just quit his job at Merrill Lynch but said little else. Previously, Jutting had told people in the pub he liked ‘wild Indonesian girls’. ‘He kept telling everybody he was a psychopath - psychopathic. I didn’t take it seriously,’ the pub employee told the Telegraph. Miss Ningshi’s decomposing corpse was found five days later when Jutting called police after allegedly killing a second sex worker, 32-year-old Seneng Mujiasih, known as Jesse. Seneng’s 55-year-old mother Juminem told the Mail yesterday her daughter’s killer ‘must die the same way that Seneng died'. She added: 'He must die with the knife. It must be plunged into him time and again, so that he suffers and then dies. An eye for an eye.’","Andrew Sadler taught French at £6k-a-term Abberley Hall in Worcestershire .

"Jo Swinson and her husband Duncan with Baby Andrew. She yesterday launched an attack on society’s ‘obsession with women’s role as mothers’ Jo Swinson yesterday launched a scathing attack on society’s ‘obsession with women’s role as mothers’ - which she branded a ‘Call the Midwife’ view of parenting. The junior equalities minister was speaking at an event on ‘what women voters want’, where she came under pressure to provide financial support for stay-at-home mothers. Miss Swinson, who is married to a fellow MP Duncan Hames and gave birth to their first child last year, said the Lib Dems had driven a ‘revolution’ by pushing for flexible hours and shared parental leave of up to a year. She said the Government had also taken steps to increase tax-free childcare for working parents. But she added: ‘The very idea of men caring for small children or mothers forging successful careers is anathema to many Tories, who’d apparently rather have a Call the Midwife version of parenting. At least we recognise that women might want both a fulfilling job and family life. ‘With a paltry two weeks of paternity leave and popular culture that brands dads as hapless and bumbling, men are written out of the family script with worrying regularity.’ However after her speech, several audience members raised concerns about full-time mothers being ignored by politicians. Karen Wilkinson, a party member who has been a stay-at-home mother for ten years, said the Lib Dems should consider ways to ‘level the playing field’ for full-time parents who ‘pay a high price’ in lost income. She went on to say: ‘Not only do stay-at-home parents care for their children but they often provide the glue that makes a neighbourhood a community and undertake much voluntary work supporting working parents and older people. ‘For this they pay a very heavy price in lost income, lower self-esteem and significantly reduced opportunities for future employment and pensions. So can we please consider policies to level the playing field, not just insist on pushing people back into work.’ Scroll down for video . Miss Swinson, who is married to a fellow MP Duncan Hames and gave birth to their first child last year, said the Lib Dems had driven a ‘revolution’ by pushing for flexible hours and shared parental leave of up to a year . And Lib Dem activist Elizabeth Jewkes told Miss Swinson that stay-at-home parents should be given around £40 a week – the sum they would be entitled to tax-free if they worked. She revealed that she had suggested the policy to Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander earlier this year, but said he was ‘only interested in helping working parents’. Speaking about her proposal, she said: ‘This would give mothers and fathers at home a value, and not just people with children but others with caring responsibilities. Many people only do this for a couple of years and then go back to work, but it’s a really important thing to do.’ Miss Swinson said she would be interested in seeing details of the plan to help stay-at-home mothers, but added: ‘It’s pretty expensive to do so and that’s the big challenge.’ Miriam Clegg last night declared: ‘I want to have what men have’ – as she set out the case for women to combine family life with a career. The high-flying mother-of-three said women feel pressured to choose between having a job and having children. Mrs Clegg, who prefers to be known by her maiden name Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, told the BBC: ‘I am asked all the time do you want to have it all, and I don’t want to have it all – I want to have what men have. Orange is the new black: Miriam Clegg's colourful shoes yesterday and right, her red printed top . ‘So if many men have children and a job, and that’s what they choose, I do not know why I cannot have that, if that’s what I choose.’ Mrs Clegg, who earns a reported £500,000 a year as a partner at international law firm Dechert, has spoken out in the past about the need for men to take more responsibility for childcare. Earlier this year she suggested that fathers who look after their children have ‘more cojones’ and has hit out at ‘dinosaurs’ who believe the issue should be left to women, saying that caring for children ‘does not affect your level of testosterone’. Speaking yesterday, Mrs Clegg also said it was ‘crucial’ for women who want to work and have a family to choose their husbands carefully. But in an interview with Sky News, she admitted that not all women wanted to work while their children were growing up, saying: ‘There will be other women who don’t want that.’ Unlike her husband, she was seen wearing only two different outfits yesterday. Mrs Clegg chose jeans, shoes from Zara and a red printed top from Spanish brand Dolores Promesas for a visit to a school. She later changed into a beige dress and bright orange shoes for her husband’s question-and-answer session.","Jo Swinson said idea of men caring for small children or mothers forging successful careers is 'anathema' to many Tories .

"An Australian online retailer has come up with a novel way to keep bearded hipsters and long-haired lasses looking smooth when taking calls on their shiny new iPhone 6's. In the latest Apple controversy, people around the world have been complaining that the new smartphone is pulling out hair. The social media hashtag  #Hairgate went viral  after allegations that new owners are getting their locks and beards 'snagged' between the aluminium and glass parts of the new phones when holding it to their faces. But don't worry: If you were thinking of upgrading to Apple's latest yourself, apparently Kogan.com can shave you. In response, and on the back of a string of hoax advertisements suggesting the phone is good for shaving a woman's legs and trimming a man's facial hair, Australia's biggest online retailer is offering free razors with each new iPhone 6 purchased through its site. 'Don't tear your hair out looking for the best iPhone 6 deal — this is it,' says CEO Ruslan Kogan in a PR release. 'But it is a limited time offer. It might be hair today, gone tomorrow. You won’t find any other retailers able to trim this much off an iPhone 6 and provide you with a free shaver as well.' 'The last thing we want is Australians walking around with unsightly bald patches just because they wanted the latest smartphone,' said Kogan, nobly. Scroll down for video . Claims: Chad Coleman was one of the first people to raise the issue on Twitter after complaining that his 'scruff' was being ripped . Anger: Scott Bilsky blamed the seam where the aluminium meets the glass on his hair being pulled out . Scandal: Hairgate is the latest controversy following bendgate - where users said the phone was bending when it was placed in a skinny jeans pocket or sat on . New iPhone 6 users first complained that their phones were bending in their back pockets or when wearing skinny jeans. This latest scandal, following on from 'bendgate', has led to a flurry of angry posts on Twitter under the hashtags #Hairgate and #Beardgate. 'Anyone else getting beard hairs pulled by the iPhone 6/Plus? It catches my scruff in the seam and yanks it when I make calls,' tweeted Chad Coleman . Paul Peavler complained: 'The seam on my iPhone where the aluminium meets the glass is definitely catching my hair and pulling it out.' Others have said the phone 'has it all' and can save you money on going to the hairdressers. Response: The latest complaint led to some creating mock adverts, one was as a beard trimmer for men . Smooth: Another involved a woman apparently shaving her legs using the iPhone 6 . Earlier this month, the electronics giant were forced to respond to complaints the phones were bending. Apple said its iPhones feature stainless steel and titanium inserts to reinforce high-stress locations and use the strongest glass in the smartphone industry. 'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus,' said Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller . Laban Roomes, CEO of Goldgenie, a company which customizes and gold plates the iPhones, said the only way an iPhone may have bent is if someone put it in their back pocket and sat on the phone for a very long time. Kogan.com's Founder and CEO Ruslan Kogan has denied rumours his entrepreneurial company would also begin offering reinforced jeans with online purchases of the iPhone 6 Plus. Problem: Paul Peavler, blaming the design of the phone for the issue, referred to the problem as 'seamgate' Attribute: Mo Jiwa put a positive spin on the newest perceived flaw saying the iPhone 6 is now the phone that 'does it all' Economical: Another social media user said the problem could provide assistance to personal finances, as it would save you money on going to a hairdresser .","Online retailer claims it can 'shave' prospective iPhone 6 buyers from latest '#Hairgate' dramas .

"The mayor of a Los Angeles suburb has died after being shot multiple times in the torso by his wife during an argument - but she has been released without being charged. Lyvette Crespo, 43, shot her husband Daniel Crespo, 45, to stop him from beating their 19-year-old son, who had intervened as the couple fought at their home in Bell Gardens at 2.30pm on Tuesday. Mayor Crespo was pronounced dead at hospital, Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Crystal Hernandez said. His wife was detained and questioned, but later released without being charged. Family members said the couple, who had been married since they were teenagers, had recently been fighting about money, KTLA reported. Scroll down for video . Killed: Daniel Crespo, the mayor of Bell Gardens in California, has been shot dead by his wife Lyvette, pictured, during a domestic fight at their home. Mrs Crespo apparently shot her husband after he punched her son . Official: Daniel Crespo, pictured, and his wife married in New York in 1986 before moving to Califonia . Sheriff's homicide detectives 'determined that no arrests will be made at this time' after interviewing Mrs Crespo, the department said in a statement late on Tuesday. 'The facts of the case will be presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office who will determine if criminal charges will be filed.' Paramedics were called to the couple's Bell Gardens condominium shortly after 2:30 p.m. Crespo and his wife had gotten into an argument in the master bedroom of the home, Hernandez said. Crespo's brother, William, told KTLA that the mayor had wanted to sleep but his wife wouldn't let him. 'He was tired, he was working all night, and working the days,' he said. 'He wanted to sleep. She wouldn’t let him sleep.' Their son, Daniel Jr., 19, tried to intervene and Crespo got into a struggle with him. Crespo then punched his son in the face, NBC LA reported. Scene: Mayor Crespo was shot to death on Tuesday afternoon during an argument with his wife in the bedroom of their Bell Gardens condominium (pictured), authorities said. She has not been charged .

Crespo and his wife were high school sweethearts who married in 1986. They met in New York, according to a biography on the city's website. The couple then moved to Bell Gardens and they had a daughter in 1987 and a son in 1994. 'I couldn't believe it - I still can't believe it,' Crespo's brother, William Crespo, told NBC Los Angeles.

'Mayor Crespo was a respected public servant who dedicated his life to protecting and helping others in southeast Los Angeles and throughout the region.' The city's website on Tuesday night had an image of a black bow and a statement from Mayor Pro Tem Priscilla Flores and three council members that said the shooting doesn't appear to be related to Crespo's mayoral activities.

"David Cameron turns 48 today but it will be UKIP with something to celebrate. As the Prime Minister marks his birthday in Number 10, some 80 miles away in Clacton history is being made as voters go to the polls in the by-election triggered by Tory MP Douglas Carswell's defection. Polls suggest UKIP will easily win the seat, giving the party its first elected MP in the Commons which Nigel Farage hails as a 'new dawn' in British politics. Scroll down for video . Tory defector Douglas Carswell and UKIP leader Nigel Farage are all smiles in Clacton today, knowing they are course to secure UKIP's first elected MP in today's by-election . Mr Carswell gave supporters a thumbs up after leaving a polling station. He has not voted because he officially lives in Fulham . Mr Carswell stunned Westminster with his decision to defect from the Tories in August . Polls have put UKIP on course to win up to 6,000 more votes than the Conservatives, in what is set to be a humiliating by-election defeat for Mr Cameron. In a separate by-election being held today, Labour is expected to hold its Heywood and Middleton seat but UKIP could break through 30 per cent to come second. Mr Farage told the Telegraph: 'It is a new dawn. It is the end of the closed shop of two-and-a-half party politics. 'Winning the European elections was an earthquake. Clacton is a shift in the tectonic plates of British politics. And if we win in Heywood and Middleton, it will be Krakatoa.' At the 2010 general election Mr Carswell won the seat with a 12,000 majority for the Tories, and UKIP did not stand against the prominent Eurosceptic. The Tories have been rocked by Mr Carswell's defection in August, which was followed by Mark Reckless switching parties on the eve of the Conservative party conference last month. UKIP leader Nigel Farage, pictured in Clacton today, has hailed the prospect of gaining a seat in the Commons as a 'new dawn' Mr Farage was out on the campaign trail in Clacton today, drumming up support for Mr Carswell . UKIP supporters hope victory in Clacton will lead to more MPs being elected at the 2015 general election . Mr Carswell and Mr Farage staged a bizarre visit to McDonalds today, where they ate McFlurry icecreams . Douglas Carswell was one of the most prominent Eurosceptic Tory MPs but his defection to UKIP in August was still a major surprise in Westminster. The libertarian Clacton MP regularly spoke out against the Government on Europe, the economy and Parliamentary reform. The maverick backbencher once led calls for MPs’ expenses to be opened up to the public– but was then criticised after it emerged he claimed cash back for a ‘love chair’ for his home. He is popular among many of his former Tory his colleagues, some of whom refused to campaign against him. In Clacton his popularity outstrips that of the Tories. One senior Conservative said: 'There is not a Tory machine campaign machine in Clacton, it is a Carswell machine.' Mr Carswell grew up in Uganda where his doctor parents worked. He was educated at St Andrews School, Kenya, before moving to the exclusive Charterhouse boarding school in Surrey. Senior Tory strategists accept they stand little chance of holding Clacton, where Mr Carswell has a strong personal following. But Mr Cameron has made clear he will not give up on Mr Reckless' Rochester and Strood constituency, accusing him on betraying Tory activists who worked hard to get his 'fat arse' on the Commons benches. Mr Reckless has a small lead in the polls, but the Conservatives believe they can hold it, and will head there on Friday afternoon after the Clacton result to campaign. The Prime Minister made a last ditch visit to Clacton last week, and acknowledged the Tories were 'the underdogs'. The Conservative candidate fighting Mr Carswell is Giles Watling, an actor best known for his appearance as the vicar in the 1980s sitcom 'Bread', who is from the area and has been a local councillor for several years. But in a sign of the Tory attitude to the seat, London Mayor Boris Johnson was caught out on live radio this week when he could not remember Mr Watling's name. Quizzed on the radio about the Conservatives' chances in this week's by-election, Mr Johnson could only venture that the candidate was a 'superb man... Stirling? Girling? Something like that.' In Heywood and Middleton in Greater Manchester, Labour have approached the by-election with increasing panic amid concerns that Ed Miliband is not in touch with the voters about immigration. One MP said yesterday that if UKIP finished within 2,000 votes of Labour there 'alarm bells would start ringing' about Mr Miliband. The MP, who did not wish to be named, said it would suggest that the direction of the party 'was not one that was appealing to our core voters'. A study last week found that the UKIP surge could prevent Labour taking dozens of Tory target seats at the next election. Prime Minister David Cameron made a campaign visit to support Tory candidate Giles Watling last week, but the Tories accept they stand little chance of holding the seat . Voters are also going to the polls in Heywood in Greater Manchester in a by-election triggered by the death of long-standing Labour MP Jim Dobbin . Labour voters Tim Dolan and Marie Oliver at the polling station at Arnhill Library, Argyle Parade in Heywood . Voters turn out to vote at a polling station in Frinton-On-Sea, for the Clacton by-election . By-elections are rarely dominated by debates on the intricacies of policy. More often they are a chance for voters to give the government of the day a bloody nose. But Clacton is unusual, because instead of being triggered by a death or a resignation, the incumbent MP is standing again, albeit for a different party. The European Union is front and centre in the contest, with Douglas Carswell complaining that David Cameron's Tories are 'not serious about real change'. But UKIP is also trading on the anti-politics mood which has spread across much of the country, notably in deprived areas like Clacton. By far the biggest factor in Mr Carswell's likely victory is his own popularity. He won his first election in 2005 by just 920 votes, but was returned in 2010 with a 12,000 majority. The Tories admit they cannot compete with that, but hope to do better against UKIP in other seats. Dr Matthew Ashton, a politics expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'If UKIP gain their first MP then the party will be in the unusual position of having a representative in parliament, but not the leader of the party. 'In the short-term this isn't necessarily a problem. However if the party gains more seats, yet Farage fails to be elected, this could lead to possible tensions and even a leadership challenge. 'A win for UKIP won't necessarily lead to any more defections. 'If any MP did decide to leave their party it would be difficult for them to not follow the example of Carswell and call a by-election. For any MP with a small majority, or a majority based on party support, rather than their personal vote, this would be a huge gamble.' Clacton has become a key battlefield in the rise of UKIP following Mr Carswell's defection - but the region has already proven to be fertile ground for the party. There have been signs for some time that the loyalty of so-called ""Essex man"" - valued by the Conservatives since the time of Margaret Thatcher - has been waning with voters keen to embrace an alternative. In recent council elections, authorities in Basildon, Castle Point and Southend-on-Sea shifted from Tory control to no overall control after Ukip made significant gains. The party also made gains in Thurrock. All of the districts had traditionally been Tory strongholds. This success was reinforced by the European elections with Nigel Farage's party polling 542,812 up from 313,921 at the previous poll. This compared to a Tory vote of 446,569.","UKIP on course to deliver a bloody nose to the Conservatives and Labour .

Emotional reunion: 5-year-old Dachshund Tinkerbell was presumed dead after a devastating California mudslide on Friday. Here, she and her owner are reunited on Sunday . Everyone's safe: Officials say the mudslide was triggered when a storm drainage ditch became too full of debris to divert the water and mud. Only Tinkerbell's owners' home was a complete loss . That's when a neighbor spotted the 5-year-old pooch in a window. 'Cheers erupted this morning inside the Ventura County Fire Communications Center upon receiving the report,' Ventura County Fire Department posted on their Facebook page.

"As many as 25 children have been struck down by severe sickness while on a summer holiday at a resort in Turkey - leaving them on IV drips in hospital, it has been claimed. Six British families are taking legal action against Hotel Marmaris Palace  and tour operator Thomas Cook after their children were among those allegedly suffering vomiting and diarrhoea. Matthew David, from Manchester, was staying at the four-star resort with his wife Kelly and their two children, Maizy, six, and Alfie, three - who he says fell unwell on the fifth day of their two-week break. Nightmare holiday: Matthew David's children Maizy and Alfie pictured in hospital in Turkey . An aerial view of the five-star Hotel Marmaris Palace, where as many as 25 children allegedly fell ill . The couple, who were celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary and Kelly's 35th birthday, say their children fell violently ill, with Maizy the first to be affected followed by her little brother. 'It couldn't have been any worse really, it was horrific,' Matthew told MailOnline Travel. 'We thought it was just a stomach bug like you get on holiday but it go so much worse than that. 'We were up all night with the kids on the Thursday and in our room all day on the Friday, they just couldn't keep anything down, but by Saturday we had to see the doctor.' Matthew said the hotel medic called a local doctor, who after examining the kids rushed them hospital in his own car. The children were admitted straight away and placed on intravenous drips. Once they were discharged that evening costs had amounted to £300 each for  the doctor and hospital, and £80 for medication. 'It couldn't have been worse': Alfie was placed on an IV drip after falling unwell while on holiday in Turkey . Severe symptoms: Maizy pictured in hospital after falling unwell in Turkey. The family have launched legal action again Hotel Marmaris Palace between Icmeler and Marmaris, and tour operator Thomas Cook . The Davids tried to make the most of their holiday once back at the resort but after a couple of days the children 'too poorly', Matthew said, and the call was made to end their trip four days early. Matthew said the Thomas Cook representative arranged new flights home for the family at a cost of £200 each, and they were left to fend for themselves in getting to the airport with a fare of £70 adding to the damage. 'It was money we didn't have, so my wife's sister had to pay for the flights and the taxi,' Matthew said. 'We'd already paid for a transfer but that didn't cover it. 'When we were talking to the rep we were informed there were 25 other reported cases of the same sort of thing as our kids had, the same symptoms, and it was all children. 'Around the hotel they just tried to wash their hands of it. No pools were closed and no kitchens or anything were closed, that I was aware. The Sunday flea market in central Marmaris in Mugla province, Turkey, near where the families were staying . 'The rep was sympathetic but didn't really help at all. They just wanted it to go away.' The Davids are in contact with five other families and are being represented by legal firm Farnworth Rose, in Lancashire, in a joint action against Thomas Cook and Hotel Marmaris Palace. Holiday claims solicitor Tracy Stansfield, who is acting for the families, said: 'I am very concerned about the reports of children becoming ill at the Marmaris Palace in Turkey. 'It would appear that a large number of children have been affected by symptoms including stomach cramps, high temperatures, diarrhoea, and vomiting. 'It is vital that tour operators and hotel management carry out a full investigation into the food and hygiene standards at the Marmaris Palace, in order to identify the source of the illness and prevent further outbreaks. A sunny beachside promenade in the resort town of Icmeler, which neighbours  Marmaris, in Turkey . 'It is terrible to read of young children becoming ill with such a nasty illness. Holidays are meant to be enjoyed and to have them ruined in such circumstances is truly upsetting.' A spokesman for Thomas Cook told MailOnline Travel 'a small number of guests staying at the Hotel Marmaris Palace in Dalaman, Turkey, reported a stomach upset, usually lasting approximately 24-48 hours. Preliminary indications suggested that this was of a viral nature'. Thomas Cook refutes Mr David's claim that the support of the hotel and tour rep was inadequate. 'Our resort team offered every assistance to the small number of customers at the Marmaris Palace who fell ill earlier this summer,' the spokesman said. 'We ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner. 'However, we can confirm that we have been approached by a no-win, no-fee lawyer on behalf of some customers who stayed at the Marmaris Palace earlier this year. 'While our investigation into the illness continues, we are unable to provide further comment so as not to unduly influence any potential legal proceedings.' The Marmaris Palace is promoted as a child-friendly holiday haven 'with loads of stuff on offer for the kids', according to its website. 'From a treetop climbing adventure to the Thomas Cook Kids' Club, a playground and waterslides, there is certainly plenty to do at the Marmaris Palace to keep the kids entertained,' the website says. MailOnline Travel has contacted Marmaris Palace for comment.","Father of two children hit by bug claims rep told him 25 others had fallen ill .

"Brisbane Broncos centre Jack Reed will miss England's Four Nations campaign after dislocating his shoulder for the third year in a row. The 26-year-old Yorkshireman sat out the 2013 World Cup after dislocating his shoulder last September and is due to undergo further re-constructive surgery after suffering a repeat injury during the Broncos' 22-12 loss to Melbourne on Friday. Reed's 33rd-minute try had brought his side back in contention at 12-10 but his night was cut short shortly afterwards when he dislocated his shoulder while making a charge in the final play of the first half. Out: Brisbane Broncos centre Jack Reed (centre) has dislocated his shoulder for the third year in a row . 'He's dislocated his shoulder unfortunately and that's the third year in a row,' Brisbane coach Anthony Griffin said. 'He'll probably have to have a reconstruction, which is disappointing for Jack, he's been in really good form.' Reed, who was born in Silsden, near Keighley, but raised in Queensland, made his England debut against France three years ago and played in the final of the 2011 Four Nations Series against Australia at Elland Road.","Brisbane Broncos centre Jack Reed will miss the Four Nations .

"A school bus driver has been arrested for his third DUI after he allegedly drove a vehicle filled with high school students while drunk. Robert E. Murphy, 59, from Ashland, Massachusetts, was driving the Hopkinton High School cross country team back from a meet on Saturday night when one of the coaches on board called police with concerns that he was intoxicated. Hopkinton Police Officer Aaron O'Neil met the bus, which was carrying 25 students, as it was turning into the high school parking lot. The school bus driver has been arrested on DUI charges for the third time after allegedly driving his vehicle while drunk, with 25 high school students from the cross country team on board (file picture) Once all the students were let off safely, Officer O'Neil conducted a series of standardized sobriety tests on Murphy, which the driver failed, CBS Boston reported. Boys Cross Country Coach Jennifer Fairbanks told the news channel that the bus driver was swerving during the journey. 'We were heading home from a race down on Cape Cod and there were a few things that I finally put together,' she said. 'It still makes me nervous.' Ms Fairbanks said she called police, but she did not want the students of the bus to know anything was wrong. 'I was just dealing directly with police,' she said. 'My biggest concern was just keeping all the kids on the bus safe.' Murphy was arrested on charges of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and operating a motor vehicle to endanger. Police said it was Murphy's third DUI offense. He was taken to the Hopkinton Police Department where bail was arranged and he is scheduled to appear at Framingham District Court later today.","Robert E.

"Leeds have sprung to the defence of full-back Zak Hardaker, suggesting he may be the victim of a witch hunt over further allegations of homophobic abuse. The 22-year-old England international served a five-match ban earlier this year after being found guilty of making homophobic comments to referee James Child during Leeds’ Super League game at Warrington on May 30 and now the Rugby Football League is investigating claims that he made an abusive comment during last Friday’s home defeat by St Helens. Hardaker was shown on television mouthing a comment to Saints forward Mark Flanagan, which was apparently heard by match referee Richard Silverwood, and Leeds say the RFL has employed the services of a lip reader to aid their investigation. Public backing: Leeds Rhinos have jumped to the defence of full back Zak Hardaker following fresh allegations . Punished: Hardaker served a five-match ban earlier this year after being found guilty of making homophobic comments to referee James Child . The Rhinos stood by their player following his ban in June and on Wednesday called for an external investigation into the actions of the governing body and its officials into their 'vigorous' pursuit of the alleged incident. Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington said: 'We are concerned there appears to be a witch hunt by the RFL towards Zak Hardaker and we are calling for an external investigation into the issues surrounding the investigation. 'We know the match commissioner was asked by the media at the post-match press conference if the referee had reported any incident or comment and they were told ""no"". 'We want to know why the referee’s report quite mysteriously now contains a reference to a possible comment. Unhappy: Gary Hetherington (left) is not pleased with the way full back Hardaker has bee treated . 'It seems incongruent with the RFL’s stance and the vigour that they are now pursuing this incident with that the referee would not have reported this to his superior on the night, as is the protocol in these circumstances, or taken action during the game. 'We understand a St Helens player has been interviewed and he has stated he did not hear anything. There is a hint of mystery about the whole issue and the use of a lip reader has added a new dimension to on-field conduct, particularly when games are televised.' A spokesman for the RFL declined to confirm whether the services of a lip reader were being called on. 'An investigation is taking place,' he said. Leeds confirmed that Hardaker would play against Wigan in Friday’s top-six clash at the DW Stadium. Hetherington added: 'Whilst the RFL deliberate, we will continue to support Zak and at the same time press the RFL for clear transparency about the whole process.'","Zak Hardaker served a five-match ban after being found guilty of making homophobic comments .

"Savings of up to £1million held in a failing bank will be protected for up to six months, as regulators strive to avoid a repeat of the panic when Northern Rock faced collapse. The Bank of England yesterday announced a range of measures designed to protect savers and taxpayers from another financial crisis. They include automatically transferring savers to a different bank account if their own lender is collapsing. Scroll down for video . Government wants to avoid a repeat of the extraordinary scenes in September 2007 when customers formed huge queues outside Northern Rock branches to withdraw their money . Under the new regime, savers who receive a temporary boost to money held in their bank account will be protected. It is hoped this will give peace of mind to those who have just sold their home, received an inheritance or a large pay-out from an insurance policy. Instead of the current limit of £85,000, deposits of up to £1milllion will be guaranteed for up to six months under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, . The Bank of England said the temporary £1million limit - introduced in July next year - would cover around 99pc of house sales in the UK - and 92pc in London. There will be no limit in the protection for pay-outs on personal injury claims. The added protection will also prevent customers from having to split their money into £85,000 blocks to ensure their cash is covered. The Government wants to avoid a repeat of the extraordinary scenes in September 2007 when customers formed huge queues outside Northern Rock branches to withdraw their money, in the first run on a UK bank for more than a century. Savers with pensions and insurance policies will also receive more protection if their insurance company goes bust, with 100pc of the income from annuities protected under the compensation scheme instead of 90pc. Last night one leading MP welcomed the move. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chairman of the Treasury Select Committee said: “With deposit insurance set at £85,000, many people at some stage in their lives could be briefly vulnerable to a catastrophic loss when they transact on a house or receive a legacy. Although the risk is very small something needs to be done – those people need some protection.’ A key priority of the Bank of England since the recent financial crisis has been to ensure banks are allowed to fail, without causing a meltdown in the financial system and disruption for customers. The Government and regulators have pledged that taxpayers will never again be forced to bail out failed banks, following the £46billion injection of public money into Royal Bank of Scotland and the £20bn rescue of Lloyds during the financial crisis. Under proposals announced by the Bank of England yesterday, if a smaller bank goes bust customers’ accounts will be automatically transferred to another lender within 24 hours so they can continue to withdraw their cash and use their cards. Failing that customers should receive pay-outs from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme within seven days instead of the current 20 days. There measures are set to come into force in the second half of 2016. Under the new ‘bail-in’ regime, if a bigger bank collapses investors and bondholders will take the first hit and lose some or all of their money. It is hoped this will minimise disruption for savers who will continue to have access to the £85,000 or more they have guaranteed under the compensation scheme. Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England and chief executive of the Bank’s financial safety watchdog the Prudential Regulation Authority, said: . Andrew Bailey: ‘These proposals will allow customers to have continuous access to the money in their bank account – of receive payment from the FSCS is this is not possible’ ‘These proposals will allow customers to have continuous access to the money in their bank account – of receive payment from the FSCS is this is not possible.’ Big lenders will be forced to ‘ringfence’ their High Street retail operations from their investment banks by January 2019, insulating ordinary savers from the risky activities of so-called ‘casino banks.’ The changes are expected to cost the industry between £1.7billion and £4.4billion, with industry experts warning mortgage rates could go up and savings rates could fall as banks pass on the costs to their customers. Banks will have to submit their preliminary plans on how they expect to restructure their operations by December.","Bank of England announced measures to protect savers and taxpayers from financial crisis .

"When you are married to the Queen's granddaughter, you might expect the in-laws to treat you with decorum. But it seems Mike Tindall has to put up with the occasional royal ribbing as well. Her Majesty cracked a joke about the former England rugby player's battered nose behind his back, one of his former opponents has revealed. Ex-Irish rugby captain Brian O'Driscoll said that when he met the Queen at a formal dinner at Windsor Castle she told him his face was in 'much better condition' than her grandson-in-law's . Ex-Irish rugby captain Brian O'Driscoll said that when he met the Queen at a formal dinner at Windsor Castle she told him his face was in 'much better condition' than her grandson-in-law's. Mr Tindall married Princess Anne's daughter Zara Phillips in 2011. The 36-year-old, who was capped 75 times for England, broke his nose eight times during his international playing career. Mr O'Driscoll, 35, told Radio 4's Today programme: 'Myself and my wife were invited to Windsor Castle for a dinner for the president of Ireland. Mr Tindall reportedly first broke his nose aged five when the seatbelt came loose on a dodgem car and he head-butted the steering wheel . The Queen and the president of Ireland were there to meet everyone and greet them into the banquet hall, so I actually ended up being last in the queue and I was introduced as Brian O'Driscoll, ex rugby captain of Ireland. 'And the Queen said 'Oh yes, you're retiring soon.' I was shocked at her knowledge. She obviously had someone whispering in her ear. 'She said, 'You look as if you've come out of it relatively unscathed. Your nose looks in better condition than Mike Tindall's does. And I just thought, how unbelievably sharp of her. And I said to her, 'Yes, thankfully it is.' Mr Tindall reportedly first broke his nose aged five when the seatbelt came loose on a dodgem car and he head-butted the steering wheel. He once had two metal plates inserted up his nose to keep it straight, but during his next club game they fell out onto a pitch. In 2011, he revealed Princess Anne asked him whether he would have further surgery before he married her daughter, but he refused, saying: 'It's part of me'. When Miss Phillips – who is an Olympic silver medal-winning eventer - became pregnant with their daughter Mia last year, he Tweeted: 'Hopefully he/she won't have my nose.' Last year the couple sold their five-bedroom home in Cheltenham for £1.27million, having bought it for £800,000 in 2009, making a profit of more nearly £500,000. They have now moved into a property on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Park estate, where Miss Phillips has stables and trains her horses.","O'Driscoll said Queen congratulated him on retiring from rugby 'unscathed'

"Feminists in France are demanding that an iconic statue based on the famous VJ-day photo is torn down because it ‘portrays a sexual assault’. The sculpture, which honours a photograph of a kiss in Times Square that captured New York’s celebration as the Second World War ended, is currently on display outside the Caen Memorial Museum near Pegasus Bridge in Normandy. It has been given to the museum on a one-year loan by the Sculpture Foundation in California to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Feminists are calling for the 25ft sculpture to be removed from outside Normandy's Caen Memorial Museum . Sculptor J. Seward Johnson Jr. created the giant piece of artwork after being inspired by Alfred Eisenstaedt's historic black and white photograph taken on V-J Day (Victory over Japan Day) on August 14, 1945 (above) However, the statue – which is 25ft tall and weighs 13 tonnes – has been criticised by French feminists who claim it shows ‘an assault’. The ‘Unconditional Surrender’ sculpture – which is also nicknamed The Kiss – shows a sailor kissing a woman while one arm is around her waist and another supports her neck. French feminist group Osez Le Feminisme has complained the statue represents a ‘sexual assault’ because the woman had the kiss 'forced upon her' by the sailor. The group, which has started a petition calling for it be removed, also claims the photographer who took the original photo – Alfred Eisenstaedt – said the sailor had grabbed and tried to kiss all the women around him before the shot was taken. A spokesman for Osez Le Feminisme said: ‘We cannot accept that the Caen Memorial erected a sexual assault as a symbol of peace. The iconic statue in Times Sqaure, New York . ‘We therefore request the removal of this sculpture as soon as possible. ‘The sailor could have laughed with these women, hugged them, asked them if he could kiss them with joy. ‘No, he chose to grab them with a firm hand to kiss them. It was an assault.’ The petition has so far attracted more than 700 signatures. However, Stephane Grimaldi, director of the Caen Memorial Museum, said the woman in the photograph had always maintained she had been happy to have been kissed. ‘She never considered that she was assaulted,’ he said. But feminists have claimed the woman - Greta Zimmer Friedman from Austria – has previously said she had been unable to escape. In 2012, Ms Friedman said: 'I have not seen him approaching, and before I understand what is happening, I found myself gripped in a vice. You caught me. This man was very strong. I kissed it, it was he who kissed me.’ However, despite her recollection, the dental nurse has never made a complaint. The historic black and white photograph was captured on V-J Day (Victory over Japan Day) on August 14, 1945 by photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt. Sailor George Mendonsa has been identified as the man in the photo who kissed Ms Friedman in Midtown Manhattan as the nation celebrated the end of the conflict. The picture was published by LIFE magazine and has become a symbol of the nation's joy at seeing an end to the devastating fighting that claimed the lives of more than 400,000 Americans. Sculptor J. Seward Johnson Jr. said he created the giant piece of artwork, inspired by the photograph, because he wanted to keep the famous pose alive. It was put in place in Normandy by cranes and construction crews on September 23. The museum said it has no plans to remove the statue, which will stay on its current site for the next 12 months.

"Leeds full-back Zak Hardaker will go into Friday's big Super League clash with Wigan 'in a great frame of mind' despite the threat of an eight-match ban hanging over him. The 22-year-old England international is the subject of an investigation by the Rugby Football League amid allegations that he used a homophobic comment during the Rhinos' 13-12 defeat by St Helens last Friday. Hardaker served a five-match ban earlier this year after being found guilty of using a homophobic comment towards referee James Child during a match at Warrington on May 30 and, if found guilty of a similar offence, he could be facing a suspension this time of up to eight matches. Staying positive: Zak Hardaker says he in 'in a great frame of mind' for Leeds clash against Wigan . That would not only end his season with his title-chasing club, but effectively scupper his chances of playing for England in the Four Nations Series in Australia and New Zealand in October and November. Leeds coach Brian McDermott insists the issue is not affecting his side's preparations for the trip to the DW Stadium for a match that could determine the runners-up spot and, speaking at the club's training base, praised Hardaker for his handling of the situation. 'I wouldn't call it a distraction, it's an issue we've got to deal with,' McDermott said. 'We won't let it be a distraction. Talking point? Hardaker (right) is under investigation by the RFL for making an alleged homophobic comment . 'Zak's dealing with it really well. He's a pro and a fierce competitor. 'While it's something he doesn't want to be having to deal with, Zak is determined to get it right on Friday night he's in a great frame of mind because of it.' Leeds stood by Hardaker in June and on Wednesday issued a strongly-worded statement through chief executive Gary Hetherington in which they defended their player, suggested he may be the victim of a witch-hunt and called for an external investigation into the actions of the governing body. High praise: Leeds coach Brian McDermott has publicly given his support to Hardaker . 'I stand by everything Gary has said, ' McDermott added. 'It's disappointing what is happening. 'Zak's getting accused of being something he isn't and his name shouldn't be bandied about at this stage. 'It's guilty until proven innocent, unfortunately.

"Warrington gatecrashed the party of their arch rivals with a 39-12 victory at Langtree Park to keep St Helens waiting for their first trophy for six years. Saints needed only a point to ensure they would finish top of the First Utility Super League for the first time since 2008 but the League Leaders' Shield was put back in its case after the Wolves ran in seven tries, two of them from the league's leading scorer Joel Monaghan, to ruin their big night. St Helens will still get their hands on the shield if Castleford lose at home to Wakefield on Sunday, otherwise they will have another chance to clinch it with a win at coach Nathan Brown's former club Huddersfield in their final league game next Friday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Warrington Wolves' epic 2015 season ticket promo #areyouin . Joy and misery: St Helens lost 39-12 to Warrington, meaning they could not claim the league leaders' trophy . Warrington's emphatic victory, which was sweet revenge for their opening-day 38-8 home defeat back in February and lifts them up to second place, came despite a spate of injuries, most seriously to loose forward Simon Grix, who was carried off on a stretcher with a suspected broken ankle just 17 minutes into the match. The Wolves also lost co-captains Michael Monaghan and Ben Westwood before half-time, although the former was able to return in the second half, while St Helens lost full-back Shannon McDonnell with a facial injury at half-time. Saints were a shadow of the team that won at Leeds last Friday yet they made a dream start when skipper Paul Wellens passed out of the tackle and forward Anthony Laffranchi's inside ball got McDonnell over for his third try in as many games for the club with just three minutes on the clock. Tom Makinson's goal made it 6-0 but the Wolves struck back four minutes later when Stefan Ratchford, restored to the side at right centre, dummied his way over for their first try. The visitors then established a vice-like grip on the game with the aid of three penalties and three goal-line drop-outs, largely the result of the fine kicking game of half-backs Richie Myler and Gareth O'Brien. The visitors shrugged off the loss of Grix to go in front when Michael Monaghan dummied his way over from acting half-back before providing the spark for a long-range try for brother Joel. Celebration: Warrington Wolves players gather in the corner after scoring a try against St Helens on Thursday . The hooker put second rower Trent Waterhouse through a gap deep inside his own half and Myler took play on before sending Monaghan the winger over for a glorious score. When O'Brien dummied his way over on 24 minutes for his side's third try in seven minutes and Ratchford kicked his third goal, there seemed no way back for Saints. But when Michael Monaghan was withdrawn on 26 minutes after taking a heavy knock and Westwood limped off four minutes later, the game took a twist. Saints received their first penalty after half an hour, to ironic cheers from the crowd, and immediately grabbed their second try, with substitute Willie Manu taking Wellens' clever pass and wrong-footing full-back Matty Russell. Makinson's second goal cut the deficit to 22-12 but Saints could not cut out the errors and paid the price. Myler added a drop goal on the stroke of half-time and Warrington increased their lead further six minutes into the second half when Myler took Micky Higham's pass to dummy his way over for their fifth try. Saints' miserable night was summed up on 52 minutes when prop Mose Masoe fumbled the ball 30 metres from his own line and Warrington centre Ryan Atkins kicked ahead on the resulting free play for Joel Monaghan to grab his second try, his 26th of the campaign. Ratchford took his goal tally to four and Atkins added a seventh try on 63 minutes after swooping on a wayward Saints pass inside their own half.","Warrington beat St Helens 39-12 at Langtree Park on Thursday night .

"A man was being questioned by police last night after his estranged wife and two young daughters were found dead in their home. Marta Galikowska, 27, and children Maja, five, and Olga, 18 months, are believed to have been stabbed to death in a frenzied attack.

Neighbour Matthew Houghton, 30, said: ‘My brother said he heard a woman screaming, that someone was being killed, so we ran up the street. ‘There was a woman already on the phone to the police. She was hysterical, saying they were all dead, that they’d all been stabbed. ‘She’d been in the house and seen it.

"Ebola scare cases are sweeping the nation, with more than 100 potential victims reported to authorities by hospitals in the last few days. Health workers are on high alert for anybody with links to West Africa - where the disease has killed thousands - who show Ebola-like symptoms, which include vomiting, bleeding and diarrhea. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has been deluged by reports of potential sufferers - but so far none have turned out to be genuine Ebola victims. Scroll down for video . Fears: Officers hand out facemasks at Newark Liberty Airport today, where it was feared a passenger had Ebola. It later turned out he did not . Confirmed case: Thomas Duncan, pictured right just after he landed in the U.S. last month, is the country's first confirmed Ebola victim - and is in a critical condition in a Dallas hospital . Precautions: Hazmat teams descended on apartments where Duncan had stayed on disinfect items including his car (pictured). As many as 100 other patients have been flagged up by hospitals across the country . High alert: Medical workers are being especially vigilant and screening as many people as possible for Ebola who have come from West Africa and display symptoms . Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who flew into the country in late September, remains the only person in the United States to have the disease. The 42-year-old is currently in a critical condition in a Dallas Hospital. A total of 49 people who could potential have caught Ebola from Duncan are being monitored by CDC experts. None have shown symptoms so far. Today Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease . Control and Prevention, said the rush of potential cases came after news of Duncan's infection spread to hospitals, who have been especially vigilant. Deadly virus: Duncan is inside the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital - where his condition is now critical . The first Ebola diagnosis in the United States 'has really . increased attention to what health workers need to do to be . alert and make sure a travel history is taken,' Frieden told a . news conference. Frieden added that many of the inquiries involved people who . had not traveled from West Africa, but that the agency preferred . healthcare workers to cast as wide a net as possible.

"A man who brutally raped and strangled a 16-year-old classmate 24 years ago has been released from prison amid protests from the girl's family. Conrad Engweiler, who murdered cancer survivor Erin Tonna Reynolds in Beaverton, Oregon in February 1990, left the Oregon State Correctional Institution at 4.45am on Thursday. Asked what he planned to do now, he said: 'Just do good. Do good. Give back to the community.' But Erin's family said they believe the 40-year-old is still a danger to the community. He has returned to Deschutes County, near to where his father lives. Free: Conrad Engweiler, pictured in May, has been released after serving 24 years behind bars for the brutal rape and strangulation of a classmate he had briefly dated in 1990. He said he wants to 'do good' 'He's still the exact same person he was at 15 years old when he murdered her,' Beth Greear, Erin's sister, told KPTV. 'He's a cold-blooded killer. It's not like he accidentally hit her with a car.' Engweiler has served 24 years and eight months behind bars after being convicted of the aggravated murder, rape and sodomy of Erin when he was just 15. He was sentenced to life but avoided the death penalty because he was a juvenile. He was one of the 'Oregon Five' men convicted of aggravated murder as teenagers in the 1990s before a new measure established mandatory minimum sentences for major crimes, KATU reported. Victim: Erin Reynolds, 16, had gone on a few dates with Engweiler before ending their relationship . The Oregon parole board called his crimes 'heinous' but said it was forced to follow rules in effect at the time of the killing. The  board ruled to free him following two hearings in May and August this year. In May, he said that his prison time has taught him remorse, empathy and compassion. Before approving his release, the board had ordered three separate psychological evaluations. For the next three years, he will be under the supervision of Deschutes County Adult Parole & Probation. He is required to register as a sex offender and cannot have contact with Erin's family. He is also banned from having contact with anyone under the age of 18 without prior written consent and cannot go near a school, childcare center, or place where people under 18s gather. Erin Reynolds was found murdered outside buried in a pile of trash outside Engweiler's father's home on February 22, 1990 - just days after she had learned she had beat cancer. She had been reported missing by her parents the evening before when she missed her curfew. The following morning, Engweiler's father called cops after he reported his son missing and said that strange car was parked outside his home. Denial: Engweiler, pictured in court as a teenager, long blamed the rape and murder on drugs he had taken . Heartbroken: Earl Reynolds comforts his daughter, Beth Greear, at Engweiler's parole hearing in 2012. The family had pleaded for Erin's killer be kept behind bars, saying he still poses a threat to the community . The car was identified as Erin's and while officers inspected the home, dogs began barking in the back yard. Drag marks to a ravine led investigators to the 16-year-old's body under debris. Engweiler was later found hiding out at the home of his mother's attorney and was taken into custody. The teenagers, who had met when they were both students at Sunset High School, had been on a few dates but Miss Reynolds had ended the relationship. At the time of his conviction, Engweiler told the court that he had was under the influence of LSD and marijuana when he killed the girl.","Conrad Engweiler left the Oregon State Correctional Institution early Thursday after being cleared by the parole board for release last month .

"This is the first video of the horrific moment a Formula One driver crashed into a recovery vehicle. The clip - taken yesterday in the aftermath of another accident at the Japanese Grand Prix - was released as Jules Bianchi was revealed to be in a ‘critical but stable’ condition following the crash. The Marussia driver received a severe head injury when his car ploughed into the back of a tractor rescuing the stricken Sauber of Adrian Sutil, who had spun off the Suzuka circuit on the previous lap. Scroll down for video . Crash: The clip was taken yesterday in the aftermath of another accident at the Japanese Grand Prix . Clip: The driver was severely injured when his car ploughed into the back of a tractor rescuing another vehicle . An ambulance was sent to the scene straight after Bianchi's crash - which knocked him unconscious - and the 25-year-old Frenchman was taken to the Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi. Last night Camille Marchetti, 24, the French girlfriend of Bianchi, sent up a prayer through Twitter for her 'champion' as he fought for his life in hospital. Bianchi's father, Philippe, told French TV that his son's condition was 'critical' and he had undergone surgery for serious head injuries. Miss Marchetti, who has dated Bianchi for a number of years, said: 'You are my champion! You are the strongest’.  She ended the tweet with emoticons of a heart and two hands locked in prayer. A spokesman for the FIA, Formula One's governing body, said today that Bianchi's condition was ‘critical but stable’ and it is understood his family will finally see him on Tuesday. They had been delayed in getting to him due to Typhoon Phanfone. Earlier today, Marussia issued a statement giving thanks for the support Bianchi had received. Girlfriend: Camilee Marchetti (pictured with Bianchi at an event) is an osteopathy student at the Collège Ostéopathique de Provence in France and originally hails from the Mediterranean island of Corsica . 'My champion'! Bianchi's long-term partner, Camille Marchetti, led prayers for the race ace's recovery as the world waited for news on his condition . They also asked for ‘patience and understanding’ with regard to further medical updates. This was after an initial release was made by the FIA yesterday confirming the driver suffered ‘a severe head injury’ and was to undergo surgery before being moved to intensive care. Marussia's statement read: ‘Following the accident involving Jules Bianchi during yesterday's 2014 Formula One Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka Circuit, the Marussia F1 Team would like to acknowledge the huge outpouring of support and affection for Jules and the team at this very difficult time. ‘With regard to the communication of information concerning Jules' medical condition, we will respect, and be guided by, the wishes of the Bianchi family. Together with Jules' care, they will remain our highest priority. ‘Therefore, we would ask for patience and understanding with regard to further medical updates, which will be communicated in conjunction with the Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, where Jules is being treated, when they feel it is appropriate. ‘Representatives of the Marussia F1 Team and Scuderia Ferrari will remain at the hospital to support Jules and the Bianchi family.’ Unconscious but breathing for himself, Bianchi was taken to Mie University hospital, ten miles from the track in Suzuka, and the race was stopped nine laps early. Bianchi's father has since told French television that his son's condition is 'critical' and he has undergone surgery for serious head injuries. Concerns: Marussia team principal John Booth (centre) walks into the hospital where Marussia Formula One driver Jules Bianchi of France is hospitalized, in Yokkaichi, Mie prefecture . The F1 season moves on to Sochi in Russia for next weekend's race and it remains to be seen whether or not Marussia will take part. Bianchi's crash saw yesterday’s event halted at lap 44, with victory being awarded to Lewis Hamilton, who has opened up a ten-point lead in the championship over his second-placed Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg with four races remaining. Sunday's race had been under threat of cancellation in the build-up as Typhoon Phanfone headed towards Suzuka and the wet weather led to it being red-flagged after just two laps, despite starting under safety car conditions. Once enough standing water had been cleared to allow the race to begin in earnest, Briton Hamilton caught and passed Germany's Rosberg on lap 29 before disappearing into the distance. The rain then came down again, driving conditions deteriorated and Bianchi crashed out, prompting the red flags to return and the race to be ended with nine laps to go. Williams driver Felipe Massa has said he had been ‘screaming’ over his radio during the race about the amount of water on the track, but former FIA president Max Mosley believes ‘everything was done as it should have been’ in relation to safety. Supportive: Miss Marchetti (far left) watches Bianchi prepare to take part in the Amber Lounge Fashion Show ahead of the Monaco Formula One Grand Prix at Circuit de Monaco last May . Asked if F1 is doing everything right to secure the safety of its drivers, Mosley told Sky Sports News HQ on Monday: ‘I think it is. I think what happened in Suzuka was very unfortunate, a freak accident. ‘But I can't really fault any of the people involved - the marshals or the race director, any of those people. I think everything was done as it should have been.’ Massa said he was trying his best to get the race called off in the run up to Sutil and Bianchi's accidents. ‘I was already screaming on the radio five laps before the safety car that there was too much water on the track, but they took a bit too long and it was dangerous,’ the Brazilian said on Sunday. A subdued Hamilton said: ‘Our first thoughts go to Jules. It overshadows everything else when one of our colleague is injured and we are praying for him. Driving rain: There had been calls to call off the race before it started amid fears the rain had made driving conditions unsafe . Fears: Bianchi's father since told French television that his son's condition is 'critical' and he is undergoing surgery for head injuries. The 25-year-old is pictured doing a lap of the rain soaked track before the race . ‘Next to this, the race result doesn't seem significant at all. Nico and I had a tough battle, we were pushing really hard... But like I said, that's not what matters - our thoughts are with Jules.’ Miss Marchetti is an osteopathy student at the Collège Ostéopathique de Provence in France who originally hails from the Mediterranean island of Corsica. She is well-known in the Formula 1 community and is often seen cheering Bianchi on from the pits as he races around the world. Known also for her glamorous attire and interest in fashion, she regularly accompanies him to F1 events and parties. Bianchi is a graduate of the Ferrari academy and former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa and team principal Marco Mattiacci went with him to hospital. It is the most serious accident to hit a race weekend since Felipe Massa fractured his skull and spent a week in a coma while qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix, in 2009.","Bianchi, 25, in 'critical but stable' condition after Japanese Grand Prix crash .

"Students and teachers smashed windows and set fire to a state capital building in southern Mexico yesterday as fury erupted over the missing 43 young people believed to have been abducted by local police linked to a drug cartel. The protesters called for the missing students, from a rural teachers' college in Guerrero state,  to be returned alive, even though fears have grown that 10 newly discovered mass graves could contain their bodies. Dramatic photographs showed smoke billowing from the government building in Chilpancingo, the capital of Guerrero, and flames licking from office windows. Firefighters battled the blaze. Scroll down for videos . Riots: The Guerrero state capital building burns after it was set on fire by protesting college students in Chilpancingo, Mexico . Riot police guard the Government palace in Chilpancingo. A group of students got into the building and destroyed several furniture pieces in protest over the disappearance of 43 classmates . Jose Villanueva Manzanarez, spokesman for Guerrero's government, said the protesting members of a teachers' union initially tried to get into the state congress in Chilpancingo but were repelled by anti-riot police. They then headed to the state government palace. On Saturday, the governor of Guerrero said that some of the bodies recovered from clandestine graves last weekend did not match the missing young people. The remains were uncovered severely burned, and experts are conducting DNA tests in an effort to identify all of the dead. With the support of hundreds of students from the Ayotzinapa teachers' college, the teachers blockaded the capital building, attacking it with battle bars, rocks and Molotov cocktails, he said. The violence came more than two weeks after police in Iguala, also in Guerrero state, opened fire on the teacher's college students, killing at least six.

In the case of Iguala, the police who attacked the students were working with the local cartel, Guerreros Unidos, according to testimony of those arrested. Monday's protests came after police in Guerrero shot and wounded a German university student in a reported case of mistaken identity, prosecutors said. The victim, Kim Fritz Kaiser, is an exchange student at the Monterrey Institute of Technology, Mexico City campus, said institute director Pedro Grassa. He told Milenio television Monday that Kaiser is in good condition and that that injury was not grave, though Kaiser will remain under observation.

Police tried to stop the van, believing it was suspicious. Police said they opened fire when they heard something that sounded like a shot or detonation, said Victor Leon Maldonado of the Guerrero state prosecutor's office. The students kept driving, fearing that armed men might be trying to kidnap them, state prosecutor Inaky Blanco said.

"In an age of computer wizardry and high-tech animation, one might have expected its simple hand-drawn style to leave a modern audience slightly nonplussed. But the sequel to Christmas classic The Snowman has become one of Channel 4’s highest-rated programmes of the year. Almost six million tuned in to watch The Snowman and the Snowdog on Christmas Eve. Heart-melting: The Snowman and the Snowdog, which is the sequel to Christmas classic The Snowman, has become one of Channel 4's highest-rated programmes of the year . The new animation recorded a peak of 5.8million viewers and an average audience of 4.9million, making it the highest-rating Channel 4 programme to be broadcast on Christmas Eve in more than 10 years and the channel’s fourth highest rating programme of 2012. The original version of the classic Raymond Briggs Christmas story The Snowman also performed well on Channel 4 this year. On Sunday night it drew an audience of 2.8million. It means that the film, which has been shown on Channel 4 every Christmas bar one since 1982, achieved its highest ratings in 13 years, when 2.6million tuned in to watch in 1999. Shown at 8pm, there were fears that youngsters would miss The Snowman and the Snowdog because it would be past their bedtime. The £2million half-hour animation also . faced competition with the last-ever episode of BBC1’s big-budget drama . Merlin, which started at 8.15pm. The . clash between the two programmes resulted in scores of viewers to . complaining to Channel 4, while others took to Twitter to express their . concerns. Happy days: The new animation recorded a peak of 5.8million viewers and an average audience of 4.9million, making it the highest rating Channel 4 programme to be broadcast on Christmas Eve in more than 10 years . In the end, the film was beaten in . the ratings by the BBC1 drama and ITV1’s long-running soap opera . Coronation Street, which recorded a peak of almost eight million . viewers. Convinced: Raymond Briggs, the author of the original 1978 book, said it took a lot of persuasion to allow the sequel to be made . The Snowman and the Snowdog is set in the same house as the original Snowman. It tells the story of a boy who discovers a box hidden under his bedroom floorboards which contains a snowman-making kit. Later that day he builds a Snowman and with a little leftover snow, a Snowdog. On that night at the stroke of midnight the two come to life. It was so laborious to make, that it took over a year to produce, since it was possible to produce only five seconds of animation a week. Unlike modern computer generated animation, the film was drawn by hand - a process that required 77 artists. Each second is made up of 12 frames and took up to 30 hours to complete. In total, the film’s artists worked their way through 200,000 pieces of paper and 5,000 pencils. There was concern that today’s young audience, used to the type of high-tech animation featured in films such as Toy Story, Shrek and Avatar, would not enjoy the simple hand-drawn style. But test audiences were enthusiastic. Raymond Briggs, the author of the original 1978 book, said it took a lot of persuasion to allow the sequel to be made. The 78-year-old said: ‘It would have been cashing in to do it before. Now it won’t do any harm and it’s not vulgar and American. I’m a notorious grumbler, but I found nothing to grumble about.’ He has admitted that he was initially unhappy when his original book was made into a film. ‘I thought, “It’s a bit corny and twee, dragging in Christmas”, as The Snowman had nothing to do with that. But it worked extremely well.’","Sequel to Christmas classic The Snowman was big winner for Channel 4 .

"More than 100 firefighters are battling to save an historic mansion house hotel from a huge blaze as dozens of guests have been evacuated. Residents and staff were led to safety from the recently refurbished Crathorne Hall Hotel in Yarm, North Yorkshire, after the fire broke out at around 10am. Eighteen fire engines were called to the 4* hotel after smoke was seen billowing from the roof. A spokeswoman from Hand Picked Hotels, which owns Crathorne Hall Hotel, said: 'The fire broke out in a wing of the hotel and has been confined there. 'No-one was hurt and all the staff and guests have been evacuated.' The hotel has 37 bedrooms, all of which were recently renovated, according to the hotel's own website. Lord Crathorne, whose family used to own Crathorne Hall, still lives in the hotel grounds and saw the fire as it raged this morning. Fire crews tackle a blaze at the historic and recently restored country house of Crathorne Hall Hotel as a fire breaks out in the building. It has played host to politicians, royalty and socialites over the decades . Residents and staff were led to safety from the recently refurbished hotel in Yarm, North Yorkshire, after the fire broke out at around 10am . Eighteen fire engines were called to the 4* hotel after smoke was seen billowing from the roof. The fire was in the right wing, where lots of the services and kitchens are housed . Crathorne Hall overlooks the Leven Valley on the edge of the Yorkshire Moors, and is believed to be one of the most recently built country halls in the UK. Set in 15 acres of private grounds, the hotel has been awarded four Red Stars - placing it among the top 200 hotels in the UK and Ireland. English actress and singer songwriter Minnie Driver stayed there while filming Who Do You Think You Are for the BBC last year. A spokeswoman from Hand Picked Hotels, which owns Crathorne Hall Hotel, said: 'The fire broke out in a wing of the hotel and has been confined there.'No-one was hurt and all the staff and guests have been evacuated' The blaze ripped through the historic mansion's roof, with flames tearing through the newly refurbished rooms. The fire could be clearly seen through the property's windows. The hall overlooks the Leven Valley on the edge of the Yorkshire Moors, and is believed to be one of the most recently built country halls in the UK . Lord Crathorne said he had 'an awful lump in the throat' as he watched smoke billowing from the roof of the wing where he and brother David grew up. He said: 'I went up there when I saw a fire engine and ambulance go past my house and it looked very bad. 'In terms of the building, it's pretty devastating but the main thing is that no-one seems to have been hurt or lost their life. 'The last thing I wanted to do this morning was get in the way, so I kept my distance. But from what I could see, it seemed pretty bad. 'It looked absolutely devastating, to be honest - like the whole roof had gone. Set in 15 acres of private grounds, the hotel has been awarded four Red Stars - placing it among the top 200 hotels in the UK and Ireland . North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service said that twelve appliances have been called to the incident, and Cleveland Fire Brigade are assisting by sending four appliances to the hall, along with a hydraulic platform . Firefighters from North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service and Cleveland Fire Brigade fought to try to stop the fire from spreading to the main part of the building . Lord Crathorne, whose family used to own Crathorne Hall, still lives in the hotel grounds and saw the fire as it raged this morning . 'Apparently the firefighters were battling to make sure it didn't get to the main part of the building.' Lord Crathorne said the fire was in the right wing, where lots of the services and kitchens are housed. 'That wing is where my brother and I grew up,' he said, sadly. 'It was the nursery wing, where we had a wonderful nanny who David and I adored.' Lord Crathorne has lived in Crathorne House, in the grounds of Crathorne Hall, since the historic hall was sold in 1977. He was last in the hotel on September 12 when 36 family and friends threw a surprise 75th birthday party for him. Parts of the historic house collapsed as the blaze ripped through the roof  - despite the best efforts of more than 100 firefighters called to the scene . He said: 'It's a wonderful building. When it was built in 1903-6, it was the largest house built in Edwardian England. 'It's massively important architecturally and a very large building. When we lived there, it had 115 rooms and 45 bedrooms. 'I just feel great sadness for everyone involved and all the wonderful people who run that hotel so well. 'I think the damage will be tremendously bad, I'm afraid, but when you think of other historic buildings which have suffered even worse damage, . they have been restored and Crathorne Hall will be too. 'It's a sad moment, but the main thing is there has been no loss of life.' North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service said that twelve appliances have been called to the incident, and Cleveland Fire Brigade are assisting by sending four appliances to the hall, along with a hydraulic platform. A spokesperson for the North Yorkshire brigade said: 'We had report of smoke coming from the roof space and dispatched a crew to investigate. 'Crews on the ground requested more appliances and 12 are currently there, or on route to the hall.' Northumbrian Water has advised people in the area that they may experience discoloured supply.","Residents and staff were led to safety from the recently refurbished Crathorne Hall Hotel in Yarm, North Yorkshire .

"Margaret Parsons, 58, launched at her husband Gordon four times with a knife after  drinking . A man who was stabbed by his wife in the chest claims she has actually saved his life - because medics later discovered he had a serious liver disease. Margaret Parsons, 48, launched at her husband Gordon four times with a knife after a heavy drinking session at their home in Launceston, Cornwall. Police found Mr Parsons, 47, bleeding from a knife wound to his chest - while his wife slept in their bedroom. Parsons pleaded guilty to wounding her husband at Truro Crown Court and was jailed for 16 months. Prosecutor Philip Lee said that after an argument, Parsons went to the living room with a kitchen knife and told her husband she would 'cut his throat'. She then struck out with the knife, catching him in the chin, and then stabbing him in the chest. But despite the attack, Mr Parsons told the court he still loved his wife - and wanted her back on her release from prison. Miss Jo Martin, defending,told the court: 'She in effect saved his life because when he was taken into hospital they discovered the seriousness of his liver disease and he is now getting treatment for it.' The Parsons had been married for about four years and lived together in Launceston but had a volatile relationship, fuelled by drink, it was said. The court heard more than a dozen incidents had been reported to police, with heavy drinking being a major factor in the trouble. Parsons pleaded guilty to wounding her husband at Truro Crown Court and was jailed for 16 months. But despite the attack, Mr Parsons said he still loved his wife - and wanted her back on her release from prison . Prosecutor Philip Lee said a neighbour was woken after hearing 'a blood curdling scream which continued for 30 minutes'. Sentencing Parsons, of Launceston, to 16 months in prison, Judge Christopher Harvey Clark, QC, said she had thrust the knife at her husband three or four times and that the thrust to the chest could have killed him. 'Fortunately it did not and fortunately it did not cause major injury to him,' he added.","Margaret Parsons, 58, launched at husband Gordon four times with a knife .

"Dylan Hartley and the rest of Northampton’s England contingent checked in for Test duty last night satisfied that their club are set fair in their pursuit of domestic and European titles. George North shone with four tries, but he was aided by England players. Luther Burrell’s hand injury was an alarming sight for England head coach Stuart Lancaster but flankers Calum Clark and Tom Wood were impressive, as was lock Courtney Lawes and Stephen Myler was largely assured in contributing 14 points with the boot. As ever, Northampton will contribute more than their share of manpower to the country’s cause as England prepare to face New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia in the QBE Test series, and Hartley claimed that he and his fellow Saints will start the international window in good heart. Dylan Hartley carries for Northampton as they continued their excellent start to the season on both fronts . Tom Wood plucks a line-out from the air as Northampton's England stars impressed again . Asked about the European challenge, he said: ‘It’s not dead, is it? It’s not dead. ‘We’re sitting at the top of the Premiership, which is nice, and our European campaign is still alive. We’ve got two weeks of LV Cup now and we’ve got some boys champing at the bit; some young players ready for a game. We’re in a good place. ‘I feel pretty good but Tom Wood’s nose looks pretty messed up! Other than that all the (England) boys are in good nick and we’re excited — it’s a big series coming up and a huge game to start.’ Clark has earned an England recall with his prodigious form and he was a forceful presence again in this demolition of the Ospreys, who were previously unbeaten this season. The blindside was particularly effective at the breakdown and Hartley offered an endorsement of his credentials for national service. Hartley and Calum Clark combine to bring down Alun Wyn Jones as Northampton halted the Ospreys . Luther Burrell, whose injury is a worry for England, offloads to Clark as Northampton dominated . ‘He’s a grafter,’ said his captain. ‘He’s on the ball, on the floor, working hard, making tackles, covering metres. You want someone like that in your team.’ Hartley admitted he was ‘worried’ before the hosts clinched the bonus point courtesy of North’s fourth try. ‘George saved the day,’ he said, while director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, added: ‘He showed what a talented all-round player he is because he came into the centre tonight and did so well. It was a tremendous performance.’ Four-try George North, who was simply superb for Northampton, 'saved the day' according to his captain . Stuart Lancaster last night called up nine players to England’s training squad with uncapped Exeter centre Henry Slade in for the first time and clubmate Thomas Waldrom recalled. Henry Slade is one of three Exeter Cheifs players called up by Stuart Lancaster to cover for injuries . Another uncapped Exeter star, Dave Ewers, completes the trio named as injury cover for Billy Vunipola (concussion), Luther Burrell (hand) and James Haskell (virus). Leicester lost 15-3 in Llanelli as the Scarlets showed their opportunistic streak in Pool Two. The Welsh region claimed two tries from Tigers’ mistakes, as wing Harry Robinson seized on a fumble by Miles Benjamin in the first half, while Aled Davies struck just after the hour, having intercepted a pass by Ben Youngs. Toulon are now in control of the pool after beating Ulster 23-13. Aled Davies dives over to score despite the tackle of Freddie Burns, following an interception .

"Confirmed: Leonid Rozhetskin disappeared five years ago amid fears he was the target of a contract killing from Moscow. A body found in a Latvian wood has been confirmed to be his . Latvian police say they have confirmed the death of a Russian-born British media magnate who disappeared five years ago amid fears he was the target of a contract killing from Moscow. A corpse found in remote woodland last year has been identified as Leonid Rozhetskin, a jet-setting filmmaker and co-founder of the free London business newspaper City AM. The flamboyant lawyer and tycoon, the 41-year-old U.S. citizen, disappeared from his villa at the trendy Baltic resort of Jurmala, in March 2008. At the time he was engulfed in a complex and bitter business dispute with a figure seen as close to President Vladimir Putin. While murder was immediately suspected after blood was found at his £2million beach-side home, there were rumours supported by Latvia's ex-police chief that Rozhetskin's death had been faked. It was rumoured he was smuggled abroad and given a new identity possibly by the FBI under a U.S. witness protection programme, in exchange for his knowledge of the business dealings of the Russian political elite. Several Moscow associates also refused to believe he was dead, and there was a report of an alleged sighting last year in Thailand. Latvian law enforcement sources confirmed on Saturday that DNA tests on the decomposed remains of a body found in woodland in Tukums Region 15 months ago match with a Rozhetskin relative. A credit card belonging to Rozhetskin was found on the corpse. 'The DNA profile of the remains was compared with the one of his family members, and they matched,' reported state news agency LETA citing police sources. The announcement may not quell claims in Russia that he is still alive, though the Latvians are now launching a full-scale murder hunt. It was unclear why it had taken so long to complete the DNA test, but in the past year Latvian sources expressed frustration with the U.S. authorities over the slow pace of obtaining a sample from Rozhetskin's mother, Elvira, 73, a U.S. resident. The woods by the town of Tukums, Latvia, where the magnate's body was found . Glamour: Mr Rozhetskin with wife Natalya (eft) and model Victoria Silversted . When her son went missing, she immediately claimed he had been murdered because he was committed to exposing corruption in Mr Putin's government. She said at the time: 'My son isn't missing. My son is dead.' In contrast, the former head of the Latvian police Juris Reksna said: 'I think Rozhetskin is alive.' He claimed: 'There are too many facts and questions here which don't add up, far too many.' Shortly before his disappearance, Rozhetskin moved his partner Natalya Belova, a glamorous blonde former model 17 years his junior, and their son Max, then aged three, into a high security £3 million apartment in Central London. He had stopped visiting Moscow, where he had been an avid partygoer, telling friends he now feared for his life. He surrounded himself with bodyguards, and made London his home. Leonid Rozhetskin, pictured with an unknown woman, at an event in Paris. He feared for his life and surrounded himself with bodyguards . While several men were arrested in the aftermath of his disappearance, including a butler with suspected links to the Russian secret services, they were freed 'long ago', said criminal police chief Janis Lazdins. Latvian police have examined a number of theories over the Rozhetskin's fate, including murder, kidnapping or a faked disappearance, and are known to have visited Moscow  during the probe, but sources say they have failed to make a major breakthrough. Rozhetskin was thought to have angered Leonid Reiman, a friend of Putin's and Russia's former telecommunications minister . Rozhetskin  was thought to have angered Leonid Reiman, a friend of Putin's and at the time Russia's powerful telecommunications minister, during a £130million deal involving a mobile phone company in which Reiman was alleged to have had financial interests. Reiman has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. Rozhetskin - who liked to dine at the Wolseley in Piccadilly and at the fashionable Japanese restaurant Nobu - vanished early on 16 March 2008. The tycoon, who was secretly gay, had spent the previous evening at his villa in the company of two young men. They left him at 2.30am, taking a taxi 25 miles to XXL nightclub in Riga. His red Porsche Cayenne, left his villa at 7.30am on 16 March, and was later found abandoned in woods, the rear seats smeared in blood. FBI agents from the US embassy in Riga were reported to be on the scene soon afterwards assisting Latvian police. Taxi drivers in Jurmala claimed that on the night of his 'death' Rozhetskin had been whisked by car across the border with Lithuania. Deepening the mystery, his £9million plane left Latvia soon after his disappearance and in the following days flew on an unexplained odyssey that took in Vienna, Geneva, Norway, Newfoundland and Luton. At the time of his death, he was known to have possessed at least one illegally-obtained EU passport in another name. The passport had been bought on the black market. His wife left London in the wake of Rozhetskin's disappearance, initially for the U.S. She was reported to be be too scared with talk. Since then she has returned to Moscow and is in a new relationship.

"Raheem Sterling is reportedly attracting attention from the likes of Bayern Munich and Real Madrid despite being without a goal in 17 games for Liverpool. The 20-year-old hasn't found the net for club or country since Liverpool's 3-1 defeat against West Ham in September - not a great stat when he looks to be angling for a new deal at Anfield. After a 10-goal haul last season as Brendan Rodgers' side came second in the Premier League, Sterling has struggled to make an impact this term. Raheem Sterling should be concentrating on his performances, not a new contract, claims Phil Neville . Sterling also found himself in the spotlight for the wrong reasons at the weekend after missing Liverpool's best chances in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester United. His recent performances have attracted strong opinion from former United defender Phil Neville, who believes Sterling must start proving himself if he is to earn a new deal. Liverpool are trying to tie the England forward to a new long-term contract and can ill-afford to lose their next potential world-class star, but Neville insists the player must concentrate on his job. Neville told BBC 5 Live: 'If I was Brendan Rodgers, I would be sitting Raheem Sterling down today. 'It’s a great lesson for younger players: I keep reading about how Raheem Sterling wants a new contract, maybe Real Madrid want to buy him. 'If you want a new contract, and you want to go to Real Madrid, the best way to get that move or that contract is to go out and score a hat-trick at Old Trafford, like he should have done on Sunday. Sterling has been attracting interest from Bundesliga champions and Champions League favourites Bayern . Phil Neville has criticised Sterling, saying the player should focus on his performances on the pitch . 'I keep saying I think Raheem Sterling is a brilliant talent, a wonderful player, but I think he needs to sit down with his agent and say, You do your job on the contract, I'll do my job on the field"" because in football, it's on the field where you've got to start doing your job.' Rodgers remains relaxed about Sterling's future despite reported interest from some of Europe's biggest clubs. The Liverpool boss said on Tuesday: 'He is a real talisman for this team. He has been a great example of the progress that a lot of the players have made here. 'He has gone from a youth team player to one of the top young players in European football. 'The club, I am sure, will work very hard (on his contract) and Raheem is happy here, he loves being a Liverpool player.'

"Arrested: Melisa Schonfield, 57, a social worker, has been charged with arranging a hit on her daughter's ex-boyfriend . The daughter of an upstate New York social worker who has been charged in a murder-for-hire plot targeting her ex-boyfriend spoke out in her defense Tuesday. Melisa Schonfield, 57, was arrested Friday after allegedly hiring an undercover detective in the parking lot of a Walmart to kill Ernesto Negrillo. The mother-of-two, who is married to a well-respected dentist, had allegedly agreed to pay the bogus hit man $11,000, telling the officer the best way to dispose of the body was 'feeding it to alligators.' The allegations stunned Schonfield's daughter, 31-year-old Alexis Schnofield, who learned of her mother's arrest on Facebook. The woman, who has a 2-year-old son with Negrillo, said her ex-boyfriend had been verbally abusive toward her, but she noted that her mother has not admitted to trying to have him killed. ‘This only happens on a Lifetime movie, she said with tears in her eyes in an exclusive interview with ABC News. ‘My mom is not a monster. She's not the mom that I grew up with, that I know.’ According to court filings, Mrs Schonfield's husband, prominent upstate New York dentist Robert Schnofield, knew about the murder-for-hire plot and even joked about the possibility of his wife getting caught. But in her interview with ABC News, Alexis dismissed the notion that her father had any prior knowledge of the alleged assassination conspiracy. Supporting her mom: Alexis Schonfield (left and right) defended her mother, saying that she is not a monster . Wife and mother: Schonfield, 57, (left) is married to respected dentist Robert Schonfield (right), who may have known about the plot . Target: Schonfield was allegedly trying to get rid of Ernesto Negrillo, 36 (pictured), who is the father of her 2-year-old grandson . Family: Schonfield, pictured with her husband Robert and daughter Alexis, is believed to have agreed a fee of $11,000 for the hit. She was held on $250,000 bail and is still in jail . Although in court papers Ernesto Negrillo has been described as Melissa Schonfield's son-in-law, the Florida man revealed to the Huffington Post that he and Alexis were never married. Speaking to the news site Monday, Mr Negrillo said he does not know why his former girlfriend’s mother would want him dead. ‘It's just f***ed up,’ he said. ‘I don't know why she would want to kill me. I haven't spoken to her in a long time.’ Negrillo said that he and Alexis broke up in 2012, just months after the birth of their son, and went their separate ways. The 36-year-old man said that he has not had any dealings with the Schonfield family in a long time, making the alleged murder-for-hire plot even more puzzling to him. But in her interview with Huffington Post, Alexis Schonfield offered a possible motive. ‘She was trying to protect my son and she got tired of watching me cry,’ she said. ‘I've been an emotional basket case the past two years.’ Bad romance: Alexis Schonfield said Negrillo was emotionally and verbally abusive toward her during their on-again, off-again relationship . Mystery: Negrillo said he and Alexis broke up two years ago, and he has not had any dealings with her family since then . A detective wrote in a report that Robert Schonfield (center) joked about the possibility that his wife (left) might get caught . The 31-year-old mother of one described her on-again, off-again relationship with Ernesto Negrillo as volatile and marred by emotional and verbal abuse on his part - a claim Negrillo has denied. Mr Negrilo said he now pities Melissa Schonfield, who will not be there for her grandson because of her ill-conceived actions. Melissa Schonfield met Jefferson County Sheriff's Detective Dave Pustizzi inside her car parked at a Walmart in Watertown, New York, last Friday to arrange a hit on Ernesto Negrillo, according to court papers. Father: Ernesto Negrillo, who lives in Holywood, Florida, said he pities his son's grandmother . Motive: Alexis said her mother, pictured right next to her husband, Robert, was just trying to protect her young grandson . After handing over an initial payment of $5,500 to the undercover cop, she was picked up by patrol cars. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Department charged the 57-year-old married mother of two with second-degree conspiracy and second-degree criminal solicitation. According to Dr Schonfield's website: 'In addition to being wife, mother and grandmother; Melisa continues to focus on her own career as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. She has totally embraced the grandmother role and has commented that being a grandparent is much less stressful than being a parent!","Melisa Schonfield, 57, accused of arranging contract killing in a upstate New York Walmart parking lot .

"Spat: Literary agent Andrew Wylie has has slammed Amazon as an 'ISIS-like distribution channel' A leading literary agent has slammed Amazon as an 'ISIS-like distribution channel' in a speech on the future of the publishing industry. Andrew Wylie, also known as 'The Jackal' for his ability to negotiate  large advances from publishers for the authors he represents, made the claims in a keynote speech at a festival for authors in Toronto, Canada. His anger at the online retailer stems from Amazon's 'brutal' tactics over royalties, comparing them to the terror group which has cut a swathe of terror across Iraq and Syria. Mr Wylie, who represents heavyweights like Salman Rushdie, Philip Roth and Martin Amis, said: 'I believe with the restored health of the publishing industry and having some sense of where this sort of Isis-like distribution channel, Amazon, is going to be buried and in which plot of sand they will be stuck, [publishers] will be able to raise the author’s digital royalty to 40 per cent or 50 per cent,' he said. 'Writers will begin to make enough money to live.' He also urged publishers to take a stand against the might of Amazon over royalties, adding that publishers should never have agreed to give the company 30 per cent of digital profits. If publishers stand together they can exert influence over what he called a 'digital trucking company' to profit more from their digital book sales in the future, The Guardian reports. Mr Wylie added: 'The publishing industry, up until now, has cowered and whined and moaned and groaned and given Amazon pretty much everything they want. Now I think that’s going to stop.' His latest comments are not the first broadside he has fired at Amazon. In March he said: 'If you have a choice between the plague and Amazon, pick the plague,' and said its publishing programme 'stands out for its idiocy'. He also turned his withering gaze on the self-publishing phenomenon and EL James' 50 Shades Of Grey calling it 'one of the most embarrassing moments in western culture.' Andrew Wylie was born in 1947 in New York and raised in Sudbury, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard College in 1970, and in 1980 established The Wylie Agency in New York. He also urged publishers to take a stand against the might of Amazon.

"The last time anyone designed one of these things, no one had ever heard of the Romans. Even the Egyptians had yet to start work on their first pyramid. Indeed, we have to rewind the clock by some 5,000 years — before the Bronze Age — to get back to an era when people would honour their dead by placing them beneath a huge, communal grass-covered mound called a long barrow. Now, however, it’s back in vogue — starting at £400 for a burial spot (or 24 monthly instalments of £17.50). As fashion cycles go, it’s rather a long one. But dozens of people have already signed up to spend eternity the Neolithic way. Farmer Tim Daw has constructed a neolithic burial mound in an attempt to make a modern long barrow . The practice of building the large tomb to store the remains of the dead dates back more than 5,000 years . Long barrows were built before the Bronze Age, and predate the Romans and the pyramids in Egypt . Tim is selling spots in the long barrow for £400, or £17.50 a month for 24 months. However, the 21st century tomb will only allow cremated remains . I am in a wheat field outside the Wiltshire village of All Cannings, next to a 5,000-ton pile of chalk and rock. It is about 220ft long and 20ft tall with a mighty facade of Sarsen stone, the same heavy-duty material which the ancients used for much of Stonehenge. For those of a more modern mindset, think Flintstones-meets-Teletubbies. Unlock a heavy iron gate in the stonework and you enter a long central tunnel that leads off into five circular chambers. Above each is a dome looming over a series of shelves (called ‘niches’) built into the walls. Here, the ashes of a loved one can be stored in perpetuity with space for up to eight urns in each. Room for all the family. And once a year, on the dawn of the winter solstice, the sun will be aligned precisely with the doorway (assuming it’s a sunny day). At that moment, a shaft of light will run the length of the long barrow. ‘If it doesn’t, I’m in trouble,’ laughs my guide, Simon Banton, 50, a Wiltshire-based engineer and ‘archaeoastronomer’, who has calculated the precise angle required for the structure. It’s cool and crunchy underfoot down here. There’s not a whiff of damp. Nor is there any electricity, so we need a torch to see. The long barrow doesn’t feel particularly funereal, but then it was only opened last week, and there is, thus far, only one resident in any of the 300 niches. A pewter urn containing the ashes of Carol Gray has been sealed in behind a pretty stone slab bearing the family name. Her husband, Adrian, chose that particular spot after seeing a butterfly fluttering around and settling there. Another 60 people have already bought places, including a woman in California and a couple from Ireland. It’s £400 for an individual berth or £1,200 for a whole niche. The tomb has five circular chambers. Above each is a dome looming over a series of shelves, called ‘niches’, built into the walls where remains are to be stored . Another 60 people have already bought places in the recently-built long barrow, including a woman in California and a couple from Ireland . ‘I think people do want something a bit different,’ says Tim, who came up with the idea in the pub . Tim's tomb is sited on part of his family's 220-acre family farm in the village of All Cannings, Wiltshire . Simon has already chosen his own. ‘It’s rather an odd feeling to know where I am going to spend eternity,’ he admits, ‘but it’s reassuring to think this place is going to be here in another 5,000 years.’ So why, in this day and age, do people want to embrace the burial practices of Stone Age man? What next? Human sacrifices? ‘I think people do want something a bit different,’ says the man behind this project, local farmer Tim Daw, 53. There is one crucial difference between the All Cannings long barrow and its predecessors. While the ancients would fill these places with human bones, the 21st-century model may only contain cremated remains. ‘It started as a mad idea in the King’s Arms,’ says Tim. ‘I was talking about where I wanted to leave my ashes. A friend of mine said she’d scattered her father’s ashes at the local crematorium and she felt like she’d lost him twice over because it was such an impersonal place.’ That was when Tim had the idea of a long barrow. This part of the world boasts many famous examples, not least the West Kennet Long Barrow, a Neolithic burial mound that was not uncovered until the 16th century. For his version, Tim earmarked a piece of the 220-acre family farm with road access. And, to his astonishment, his application for planning permission sailed through. This spot sits in what is both a Unesco World Heritage Site and an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty deep inside what you might call the Wessex pagan belt. We’re not far from Stonehenge, where both Tim and Simon work as part-time stewards. The world-famous stone circles at Avebury are nearby, as is Silbury Hill, the colossal chalk mountain built by prehistoric man. Until recently, this whole area would be full of crop circles every summer (either the pranksters got bored or the aliens moved on, depending on whom you believe). Above this spot stands the White Horse of Alton Barnes, a huge chalk drawing etched into Milk Hill, overlooking the Vale of Pewsey. In other words, this is a holy land for druids, spiritualists, archaeologists, cereologists (crop circle enthusiasts), conservationists and every breed of ancient historian. No one objected to Tim’s plan. His initial scheme was to build a concrete substructure covered with soil. But then he was contacted by Welsh stonemason Geraint Davies, who had got wind of the project. Surely, he suggested, it would be better to build it from loose stones, as the ancients would have done? The long barrow sits in what is both a Unesco World Heritage Site and an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . The pagan theme continues nearby, with Stonehenge just down the road from the field and Silbury Hill, the colossal chalk mountain built by prehistoric man, nearby . The burial site is open to people of all religions and none, however the tombs will only be open to the public for occasional interment ceremonies . First urn: A pewter urn containing the ashes of Carol Gray has been sealed in behind a stone slab bearing the family name . Over nine months, Geraint and his team of two pieced every rock together by hand, with the help of a digger and a little lime mortar for sealing gaps here and there. For the front of the structure, Geraint acquired some vast specimens of Sarsen stone from a local yard, including a three-ton whopper. How prehistoric man handled this sort of stuff is anyone’s guess. Most impressive is the roof in each chamber, concentric circles of loose stones narrowing to a flat stone at the top. Once the chambers were completed, tons of chalk and topsoil were piled on top and seeded. It will not be long before the whole thing blends back into the landscape beneath a carpet of grass and wild flowers. With his £200,000 ‘mad idea’ completed, Tim organised an opening ceremony, serving hornfuls of mead in honour of the ancients, plus slices of a barrow-shaped sponge cake. Among those who turned up was the Arch Druid of Avebury, who arrived on a motorbike to bless the long barrow with an apple, a symbol of the soul of the dead. It is still sitting there on the plinth at the end of the main tunnel where Tim has earmarked the prime niche for himself, his wife Alison and his four children. Though an atheist, he is adamant the long barrow is open to people of all religions and none. People can inscribe whatever symbols they choose on the stone slabs that seal up their niche. After all, as he points out, these structures go back to 3,500BC, which predates many of the main faiths anyway. Even the Old Testament feels a little new-fangled down here. There is no public admission to the interior and the chambers will remain locked except for the occasional interment ceremony. But people can visit the site whenever they like. ‘If people want to have a picnic on top of their loved ones, that’s fine,’ says Tim. To get some sort of perspective, I visit the West Kennet Long Barrow a few miles away. Tourists are traipsing to and from the lay-by on the A4 and several people are, indeed, having a picnic. Inside, the stonework is more rudimentary, hardly surprising given the 5,000-year age gap, and people are free to look around. Even so, there is a similar feeling of calm and mystery. A Stone Age farewell may not be to all tastes. But I can see why some would prefer it to being scattered over a municipal garden of remembrance, or being buried in a garden until it changes hands and someone decides to dig it all up. I just hope Simon has got his sums right. Because if the sun does not come beaming through on the morning of December 21, it’s going to be a hell of a job to shift this thing.","Farmer Tim Daw has built a long barrow burial site in a field on his farm .

"Ruth Wilson may be earning rave reviews for her role in raunchy US mini-series The Affair, but the actress has joked that the graphic bedroom scenes have turned her off sex for life. The show, co-starring fellow Brit Dominic West, is set to air in Britain later this year. Miss Wilson, 32, has already been hailed as a ‘breakout star’ by Hollywood bible Daily Variety for her part as a married waitress who steals West’s character away from his wife and four children. But she has admitted she is a ‘prude’ when it comes to filming explicit material, saying: ‘I’m a British prude and dread any sex scene that has to be performed. For an actor they are miserable and vaguely embarrassing. It’s put me off sex for life.’ Scroll down for video . Ruth with fellow British actor Dominic West, 45, whom she steals from his wife and four children, says she dreaded the saucy sex scenes which she says 'for an actor they are miserable and vaguely embarrassing' Ruth, pictured in a passionate kiss with West in the series, says if 'sex is just for titillation it slows up the story' She went on to claim: ‘The sex isn’t gratuitous. I was intent on trying to tell a story within those scenes. It’s not just about the sex, it’s about what is going on in each individual’s mind during it. If it’s just for titillation I think it slows up a story.’ West, 45, revealed that he was ‘concerned’ about his 15-year-old daughter watching his graphic sex scenes, adding: ‘There’s really an awful lot of sex in this. Hopefully it’s hot and erotic. It’s certainly a sexy show. I’m slightly concerned about my daughter seeing it.’ Wilson first shot to fame in the 2006 BBC mini-series Jane Eyre. She won two Olivier awards for her work on the West End stage and played a psychopathic killer opposite Idris Elba in the hit BBC crime series Luther. However after playing her impeccably dressed Luther character Alice Morgan, she said: ‘It’s lovely to go onto the set of The Affair and not have to be perfectly coiffed.’","Star gets rave reviews for role as waitress who lures a man from his family .

"The oldest known stone javelins have been discovered in Africa, predating humans by 80,000 years. The discovery of the 280,000-year-old spear tips means that they were probably created by ancestors to ancient humans, rather than by our species. This discovery means Homo heidelbergensis, our ancestor, was much more technologically advanced than previously thought. The oldest known stone-tipped spears predate the earliest known human fossils by 85,000 years. This image shows a sample of Gademotta pointed artifacts exhibiting fractures indicative of weapons that would have been thrown . Homo sapiens then either developed the . technology themselves, or learned it from Homo heidelbergensis, which . helped them to move out of Africa and out-compete Neanderthals. Researchers are now studying the stone javelin tips, recently found at an Ethiopian Stone Age site known as Gademotta. The Gademotta Formation in the Main Ethiopian Rift Valley was discovered in the 1970s and is best known for its Middle Stone Age archaeological sites. Scientists the University of California at Berkeley’s Human Evolution Research Center were recently able to study the spears and determine their age. The research centres on 280,000 year-old stone-tipped spears recently found at an Ethiopian Stone Age site known as Gademotta. The Gademotta Formation in the Main Ethiopian Rift Valley was discovered in the 1970s and is best known for its Middle Stone Age archaeological sites . Writing in the journal  PLoS ONE, they claim the weapons were made from obsidian - a naturally occurring volcanic glass known for its high blast resistance and strength. ‘[This] is significant because it provides direct evidence for a highly advantageous, complex technology that pre-dates the emergence of Homo sapiens,’ said the authors of the study. Researchers believe the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens in Africa, and Neanderthals in Europe and Asia, is the Homo heidelbergensis, also known as Heidelberg Man. Pictured is a skull of a Homo heidelbergensis, dated at 400,000 years ago and considered to be amongst the most complete fossil skulls ever found. Previous evidence shows that Heidelberg Man was an accomplished tool-maker and skillfully butchered large animals . Previous evidence shows that Heidelberg Man was an accomplished tool-maker and skillfully butchered large animals. However, the stone-tipped spears could provide a clearer understanding of the extent of this species skills. The study also suggests that, because there . were more individuals around in Gademotta during this period, there . would have been a greater chance for the spread of innovative ideas. A mixture of animal remains were found at the site by researchers have been unable to prize them apart to understand which animals were hunted. They do however know the spears were thrown from a distance at prey, instead of thrust into victims, allowing them to hunt buffalo and other game from a safer distance. There . has been much debate surrounding the precise date that early man began to . use stone-tipped spears - with some experts suggesting their use as far . back as 500,000 years ago. A . separate study done in May by Corey O'Driscoll, of South East . Archaeology in Canberra, Australia,  Professor O'Driscoll shaped flint . reproductions of spear and arrow points from the Middle Stone Age in . Africa and attached them to wooden shafts. Together . with a group of University of Queensland students, O'Driscoll ran 15 . experiments, throwing replica spears with bows or a calibrated crossbow . at lamb and cow carcasses. The . results showed 'quite a difference between the butchering marks and . projectile impact marks,'  and revealed six types of distinctive . projectile impact wounds, from drag marks to fracture marks and . punctures. These . findings prompted O'Driscoll and the University of Queensland's Jessica . Thompson to take a new look at three bone specimens from large . unidentified mammals - a rib and two vertebrae - from Pinnacle Point . Cave in South Africa. Two . dated to between 91,000 and 98,000 years ago and the third dated even . earlier, between 153,000 and 174,000 years ago - making them, at the . time, the oldest direct evidence of the use of projectile weapons.","280,000-year-old stone-tipped spears were found at Gademotta in Ethiopia .

"A mother reportedly claims that she has been cut off from her son after agreeing to an open adoption with a wealthy couple. Nina Yusupov, 32, from Brooklyn, New York, claimed to have been living on the breadline after going through a divorce in 2008 and struggling with depression when she gave up her son. She placed her son Eliyahu in a big brother/sister program where he began spending time with David and Jennifer Bergenfeld on weekends, The New York Post reported.

The couple live in a luxury apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, according to The Post. Mr Bergenfeld, 42, is an associate at the law firm D’Amato & Lynch. His 45-year-old wife acts as a lawyer for Global Bank. The Bergenfelds wanted to adopt Eliyahu but allow his birth mother to stay in his life with visits twice a month, phone calls and letters, according to court records quoted by The Post. Ms Yusupov claimed to The Post that she signed a document agreeing to this but the Bergenfelds allegedly never filed the agreement in court and stopped her from seeing her son three years ago.

"Ed Miliband's ‘complacent’ leadership is under assault from senior figures in his own party after a poll suggested the Conservatives have extended a new lead over Labour. Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott, normally a fierce loyalist, condemned Mr Miliband for pursuing a ‘core vote strategy of getting 31 per cent of traditional Labour supporters with a few ex-Lib Dem voters’. And Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said it had been a ‘mistake’ for the Labour leader to forget to make any mention of Britain’s vast budget deficit in his final party conference speech before the election. Scroll down for video . Lord Prescott, listening to Ed Miliband's speech last week, has today slammed the party leader's strategy to win the next election . Labour nerves have been jangled by a slump in the party’s ratings following the party conferences. A poll by YouGov showed the Conservatives moving into the lead for the first time in nearly three years, by just one point. Yesterday, it published another survey suggesting the Conservatives are now up to 36 per cent, with Labour on 34 per cent. It also showed Mr Cameron has opened up a 42-point lead over Mr Miliband on leadership, up from 31 last week. He is more trusted on almost every issue, with the Labour leader ahead only on the NHS. The Labour leader may as well have told party activists to 'go back to your constituencies and prepare for Coalition' Ed Balls insisted the Labour leader's speech was '10 out of 10', but admitted it had been a mistake to not mention the deficit . Lord Prescott shocked Labour HQ by tearing into his party’s approach as ‘far too timid’. Writing in his Sunday Mirror column, the former deputy prime minister mocked Mr Miliband’s ‘six-point’ plan for ten years in Downing Street. ‘Can you remember what they were? They were just one-line objectives, not detailed policies,’ he said. Attacking the strategy of trying to limp to an election win by appealing to core Labour voters plus some disaffected Lib Dems, he added: ‘He might as well have said at the end of his conference speech: “Go back to your constituencies and prepare for coalition”.’ Mr Balls revealed that the Labour leader had told him after his disastrous conference speech that he had blundered. Mr Miliband has been ridiculed after forgetting to deliver planned remarks about the need to rein in the deficit in his address. ‘He said to me afterwards it was a mistake and it was,’ the Shadow Chancellor told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme. ‘But look, that kind of thing happens sometimes in politics.’ Labour MP John Mann said there was an ‘extraordinary level of complacency that permeates the top of the party’. ‘Ed should get out and mix with real voters to discover what they really care about,’ he added. Mr Mann claimed that many backbenchers were infuriated by the ‘35 per cent strategy’ – winning the core Labour vote plus 4 or 5 per cent of former Lib Dems. ‘They seem to think we need just one more small push and we will limp over the line to victory,’ he added. Labour officials insist that polls suggest the party still has a strong lead in key marginal seats, and Mr Miliband’s conference speech has helped push the NHS up the political agenda.","Lord Prescott accuses Labour leader of giving up trying to win swing voters .

"The wife of a man who flew from Britain to Iraq to fight against ISIS militants has pleaded for him to come home. British Kurd Waleed Sulaiman, 36, travelled 3,500 miles to the war-torn country from his home in Coventry in April this year. He originally told his wife, Barbara, 44, that he was going to help his father cross from northern Iraq into Turkey for medical help. The Muslim shopkeeper promised her he would be back within a fortnight but instead stayed on to battle against ISIS terrorists on the front line. Barbara and Waleed Sulaiman, pictured celebrating on New Year's Eve in 2009, have not seen each other since he flew to Iraq to fight against ISIS . Bridget-Rojin, six, is old enough to understand her father is at war and has told her mother and father that she wants him to come . Mr Sulaiman later sent a message on the internet app Viber which said: 'I'm with the Peshmerga in northern Iraq. I'm up in the mountains with them, helping to load their weapons.' Terrified Mrs Sulaiman then spent five agonising months not knowing if her husband was dead or alive, before he finally made contact with her at the end of September. He promised he would be reunited with her and their six-year-old daughter, Bridget-Rojin, soon. But today Mrs Sulaiman said she hadn't heard from her husband since that brief conversation and now spends every day worrying whether he will make it home. She said: 'He was going over to see his dad and was going to take him to get medical treatment. He said he would be there for two weeks. 'Back in April, the only brief message I had was that he was loading weapons and taking water up to the refugees in the hills. 'After seeing the news I was terrified. I didn't know if he was dead or alive. 'When I finally got in touch with him it was worse if anything because he was telling me that he was helping the Peshmerga and that made me worry more. Mr Sulaiman, who was granted UK citizenship in 2010, told his wife and daughter, Bridget-Rojin (left), that he was going to Iraq to help his father cross the Turkish border to receive medical help . The Muslim shopkeeper has only been in touch with her husband twice since he left to fight against ISIS . 'I spoke to him at the end of September on the internet and he said everything was going really bad and he planned on coming back as soon as he can. 'I've spent months hoping and praying my husband comes home. Every day I've tried to get in touch. I'd ring his mobile but there was no answer. 'The mobile signal over there is ludicrous and when they are bombing all the time it doesn't help. 'Waleed told me it makes him cry with what is happening to innocent people. We just want him to come home safe to his family.' The couple met in Daventry, Northamptonshire, nine years ago and got married in Jordan in 2007. Barbara, who cannot work because of debilitating osteoarthritis, said Bridget-Rojin is old enough to realise her father is fighting in a deadly war. She added: 'It is getting very bad there, but ISIS has not managed to enter Duhok. 'There are thousands of refugees that have lost everything and he is trying to help. He is very kind-hearted. He told me he was taking water up the mountains to help the refugees. 'Before he went, Waleed was always talking about people like Islamic State, saying they were giving the Muslim community a bad name. He is fed-up with Muslims getting a bad name, he thinks IS are disgusting. 'I'm constantly worried about him but I have to put on a brave face for my little one. 'She knows what's going on and when we messaged him in September she said ""can you come home, I don't like all the shooting"". 'He is very loyal to his country but we both love him and miss him very much.'

"The grieving widow of beheaded mountain guide Herve Gourdel stepped out in the public for the first time today to pay tribute to her husband who was murdered by Islamist militants. A visibly distraught Francoise was comforted by friends as she and her son Erwan took part in a gathering in honor of the 55-year-old Frenchman. It came as flags were held at half-mast in France today, after President Francois Hollande declared three days of mourning for the murdered mountain guide. Herve Gourdel's grieving widow was seen in public for the first time today since her husband was killed . A visibly distraught Francoise was comforted by friends as she paid tribute to the 55-year-old Frenchman . Across the French capital, thousands of Muslims came out in solidarity to pay tribute to Mr Gourdel and protest against the Islamic State, which many insist does not represent their religion. Imams and ordinary Muslims have rallied to condemn the execution, carrying placards stating: 'Not in My Name'. Hundreds gathered outside the Paris Mosque after Friday prayers carrying signs expressing condolences and denouncing the 'barbarism' of Islamic State militants. 'This gathering is the strong and vibrant expression of our desire for national unity and of our unwavering will to live together,' Dalil Boubakeur, head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith - an official representative for the country's roughly five million Muslims - told the gathering outside Paris's main mosque. 'Islam is a religion of peace', he said, adding it 'orders respect for life'. Leading Muslim figures also signed a message published in French newspapers Friday condemning 'atrocities committed in the name of a murderous ideology hiding behind the Islamic religion'. The French flag flies at half-mast above the Grand Palais. Minutes of silence and vigils were held across the country in tribute to the beheaded mountain guide Herve Gourdel who was killed in Algeria . Muslims, holding French and Algerian flags, attend a gathering in front of the Paris Mosque after Friday prayers . 'We are also the 'filthy French',' said the statement, referring to the epithet the Islamic State group has used. Back in the southern Alpine village of Saint-Martin-Vesubie, where Gourdel worked as a mountain guide, locals, school students and other guides marched Thursday evening in memory of a man they described as hugely curious about the world. More than 800 people - including three imams - took part in the march past his office, stopping at times to light candles or lay flowers down. ""Herve was a humanist full of an overwhelming passion for the mountain that illuminated his life,"" fellow guides said in a joint statement.

The mountaineer was kidnapped while hiking in a national park in eastern Algeria that was once a magnet for tourists but later became a sanctuary for Islamists. A passionate photographer, Gourdel liked going off the beaten track, his friends have said. Jund al-Khilifa, or 'Soldiers of the Caliphate', beheaded Mr Gourdel after he was abducted on September 21 while hiking in a national park in Algeria - an area that was once a magnet for tourists but later became a sanctuary for Islamists. Less than 24 hours earlier, militants had uploaded a video to YouTube warning that the married father-of-two would be killed unless France pulled out of a coalition of nations bombing targets connected to the ISIS in Iraq. Not in my name: Muslims hold a banner as they gather in front of the Arrahma Mosque after Friday prayers in Nantes, western France . Hundreds of Muslims gather at the Great Mosque to pay a tribute answering a call by Muslim leaders to denounce the 'barbarism' of Islamic State militants . The kidnapping came following a chilling call by IS militants for Muslims to kill citizens from countries involved in a US-led coalition fighting the extremists, 'especially the spiteful and filthy French'. The threat sparked concern in France, and authorities have since strengthened security in public places and on transport. The foreign ministry also widened its vigilance alert for nationals abroad from around 30 countries earlier this week to some 40 nations - including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Wreaths and messages lay as hundreds of people pay tribute to mountain-guide Herve Gourdel . Imams and ordinary Muslims from across Paris have rallied to condemn the execution of the Frenchman . France has nevertheless said it refuses to be cowed by IS threats. The government announced Thursday air strikes had been carried out in Iraq - the second bombing raids in the space of a week. Fighter planes destroyed four hangars near Fallujah city, west of Baghdad, that 'likely' contained weapons and other equipment, a military source said. Paris opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq but was one of the first to sign up for an active role in the US-led campaign against the IS group. A woman carries a banner reading 'sincere condolences to the Family', in Paris today . It has six Rafale fighter jets based in the United Arab Emirates, carrying out the strikes in Iraq. While it has pledged to push forward with the air strikes, Paris has stressed it will not deploy ground troops, nor will it expand operations to Syria, as the United States has done. But the presidency announced France would 'continue and intensify its support for Syrian opposition forces who are fighting jihadist groups'. Yesterday, thousands of Algerian soldiers supported by helicopters were hunting for the terrorists in the Tizi Ouzou region, along with 500 marines and sniffer dogs.

Across the French capital, thousands of Muslims came out in solidarity to pay tribute to Mr Gourdel and protest against the Islamic State, which many insist does not represent their religion . 'Everything will be done to bring the killers to justice,' said a spokesman for Algeria's Defence Ministry. There are fears that other radical Islamist groups may carry out copycat attacks on Westerners following calls to do so by ISIS on Sunday. The kidnapping and murder of Gourdel, however, is believed to be a crime of opportunity, since Algeria's extremist have been confined to remote mountainous regions and the French mountaineer was one of only a very few foreigners to venture into this area. Hundreds of people paid tribute to mountain-guide Herve Gourdel, who was  he was abducted on September 21 while hiking in a national park that was once a magnet for tourists but later became a sanctuary for Islamists. The sickening four minute 46 second video of Mr Gourdel's murder - titled 'A Message in Blood for the French Government' - was released exactly 30 minutes after Barack Obama gave a speech vowing to destroy ISIS and its affiliates to the UN General Assembly. In his speech President Obama urged the world to come together to tackle the threat posed by ISIS and 'dismantle this network of death'. The address ended at 10.38am New York time, with the existence of Mr Gourdel's murder video revealed just 30 minutes later, at 11.09am. On Tuesday a video posted on YouTube showed Mr Gourdel surrounded by masked men holding Kalashnikov rifles.

The group threatened to kill their hostage by the end of the day unless France ceased its air strikes in Iraq, where ISIS terrorists control vast swaths of territory under the guise of a 'caliphate'. The footage prompted some 1,500 Algerian forces to comb through the restive, mountainous Tizi Ouzou region in the east of Algeria - desperately trying to save Mr Gourdel before it was too late. Speaking at the United Nations in New York, Mr Hollande said: 'France is going through an ordeal because of the murder of one of its citizens, but France will never give in to blackmail.

President Francois Hollande declared three days of mourning for the murdered mountain guide . 'France will never give in to terrorism because it is our duty and above all, it is our honour.The fight against terrorism must continue and be stepped up.' Politicians lined up to condemn Mr Gourdel's murder, all vowing to fight terrorism. Prime Minister Manuel Valls said: 'The support of the whole nation goes to Herve Gourdel's family. France will never give in.' MP Laurent Wauqiuez said: 'Barbarity cannot defeat the values of democracy.' Hundreds of people pay tribute to mountain-guide Herve Gourdel. Jund al-Khilifa, or 'Soldiers of the Caliphate', beheaded the 55-year-old Frenchman . Herve Morin, of the UDI party, tweeted: 'To Gourdel's murderers: You are monsters and you are hideous.' And the National Front's Louis Aliot said: 'All my thoughts are with the family of our compatriot, cowardly executed by the enemies of our civilisation.' Christian Estrosi, the deputy mayor of Nice who visited Mr Gourdel's family, said the whole country had been plunged into a period of 'national mourning.' He said Mr Gourdel's elderly parents and children were dealing with their loss 'with dignity, anger and an unspeakable pain'.

Now, the teenager is facing a number of charges, including the possession of a destructive device and a handgun violation. He is also still charged with theft in relation to the car break-ins. In an online statement, Police Chief, Jim Johnson, said the first responding officer who interviewed the tenth-grader 'did an exceptional job of police work'. Proud chief: During a police interview, the 16-year-old allegedly revealed that he had explosive devices at his home and wanted to kill people at the Towson-based school. Above, Baltimore Police Chief, Jim Johnson said the first responding officer who interviewed the sophomore 'did an exceptional job of police work' Arrest: The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was originally arrested on suspicion of a series of vehicle break-ins at the 16900 block of York Road (pictured) in Baltimore County last Saturday . He added: 'Thanks to his diligence, we intervened in what could have been an extremely serious situation' at the school in Towson. Meanwhile, a Carver administrator told the newspaper there were no 'red flags' that could have alerted staff to the student's deadly intentions. 'At this point, nothing has been shared with us [from the school] to give us any indication that this could have happened,' said Maria Lowery. 'We had no reason to suspect we had an issue.' Parents of students at Carver - a premier arts school that is considered one of the top-performing insitutions in the country - were being notified of the suspect's charges on Monday . The teenager, who is being held at the Charles H. Hickey Jr. School, a detention center for male youths, cannot be identified because he has been charged as a juvenile, . Baltimore County State's Attorney Scott Shellenberger said his office is currently reviewing the case to determine whether the boy should be charged as an adult instead.

"Denver quarterback Peyton Manning made NFL history on Sunday night when he broke Brett Favre's record for career touchdown passes by throwing his 509th scoring pass during the second quarter of the Broncos' game against the San Francisco 49ers. Manning went into the Sunday night showdown two TDs shy of Favre's record of 508 and finished with four touchdown passes on 22-of-26 passing for 318 yards in just three quarters of work. He surpassed Favre with an eight-yard pass that was caught in the end zone by wide receiver Demaryius Thomas just before halftime in the Broncos' emphatic 42-17 thrashing of the San Francisco 49ers. Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning broke the NFL record for career touchdown passes on Sunday . A digital display commemorates the NFL record 509th career passing touchdown by Manning . Manning creates history as he throws against the San Francisco 49ers during the second  half . Manning acknowledged rapturous applause from the home crowd, who rose as one to salute the 38-year-old as his team-mates briefly played keep-away to keep the record football from Manning before finally handing the ball to the future Hall Of Famer. Thomas tossed the ball over Manning to Emmanuel Sanders, who lobbed it to Wes Welker. From there, Welker dished it back to Sanders, who flipped it to Julius Thomas - all of Manning's favorite targets getting into the act as Manning ran around like a kid trying to get his lunch sack back. ‘Those guys are all great athletes, and my vertical leap isn't what it used to be. I haven't played keep-away since I was eight years old,’ Manning said. ‘That is something I will always remember.’ The Broncos (5-1) had actually talked about doing something like that but Manning said he was surprised his teammates went through with it. He shouldn't have been, Demaryius Thomas said, revealing that Manning actually had them practice it Friday.

San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick greets Manning after the game to congratulate him . Manning leaves the field after he beat the NFL record during the Broncos win over the 49ers . ‘It's easy. You did that when you were kids,’ Thomas said. ‘It's like keep the ball away from the guy in the middle.’ Come to think of it, Manning said he deserved to get picked on ‘based on my non-graceful play when I tripped on the play before.’ Manning finally got the ball along with congratulations from his teammates and coaches. The souvenir won't end up on Manning's mantle, however - the Pro Football Hall of Fame has a nice spot all ready for it. Manning had a hand in most of the game's biggest moments, from Emmanuel Sanders' first TD catch as a Bronco to Wes Welker's record-tying 39-yard catch and run against the exasperated 49ers. ‘I'm not sure what their coaches do,’ 49ers safety Eric Reid said. ‘They probably don't have to do much. 'When he's out there on the field, he recognizes the defense and makes audibles, he does it all. You're playing against a coordinator when he's out there. He's definitely one of the best, if not the best ever.’ Manning is mobbed by teammates following his momentous achievement . Manning waves to the crowd as he runs off the field after the game against the San Francisco 49ers . Favre needed 302 games to set the previous record in 2010 while playing for the Minnesota Vikings, while Manning broke the mark in 246 - 208 with the Indianapolis Colts and 38 with Denver. Manning, who added a 510th touchdown before leaving the game early as the Broncos demolished the 49ers 42-17, typically downplayed his accomplishment and said he planned to place a telephone call to Favre in the next day or so. 'I've always been a fan of quarterbacks, whether it's Brett Favre, or Dan Marino, or John Elway, so I'm very honored and humbled to join a pretty unique club,' he told reporters. 'Brett's always one of my favorite players. He played the position with so much passion, great toughness and great productivity. I just want to tell him thanks, and I'm honored to join this club with him.' Manning was happy he set the record at home - and in a winning effort. 'I was glad it was here in Denver. The fact we won the game certainly allows you to celebrate with your team. The touchdowns I've thrown have helped us win a lot of games. That's the only reason (the record is) somewhat special.' Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre previously held the NFL record of 508 touchdown passes . Manning speaks during a news conference after the game in which he broke the record . Even as the game was in half-time, Favre was already congratulating Manning on his Twitter page. 'Well deserved Peyton,' he tweeted. 'Congratulations on breaking my record. Onto600.' NBA players LeBron James and Kevin Durant also offered their congratulations. 'Legend. OneOfTheGreats,' tweeted James. 'We take him for granted because he's so consistent but we are witnessing a living legend!' added Durant. Manning missed the entire 2011 season with a serious, potentially career-ending neck injury that required multiple surgeries. Manning started Sunday's game needing three touchdowns to overtake Favre. He wasted little time making his mark, notching touchdowns in the first quarter, firstly to Emmanuel Sanders and then to Wes Welker to tie Favre's record.

"A ‘predatory killer’ got a ‘warped pleasure’ out of slaughtering a 16-year-old schoolgirl before turning up at her funeral, a court heard yesterday. Claire Tiltman was on her way to a friend’s house in 1993 when Colin Ash-Smith, then 24, allegedly stabbed her nine times in a ‘frenzied and remorseless attack’ before leaving her to bleed to death. Inner London Crown Court heard how the former milkman attended her funeral a month later with his councillor parents, wearing the same jacket he wore on the night of her murder. Colin Ash-Smith, 46, (left) 'savagely killed' Claire Tiltman (right) in a 'frenzied attack' as she walked to a friend's house in Greenhithe, Kent . The court  heard how 'controlling' Ash-Smith was photographed at Claire's funeral just a month after he allegedly killed her. The jury were shown a photograph of him wearing the jacket he is alleged to have worn while carrying out the stabbing. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC also told jurors that he habitually carried a knife and was very reclusive. He said: 'To those who came in contact with him, he seemed to be a very quiet, shy individual, something of a loner. 'However, he owned and habitually carried a range of weapons, including knives, about which he had an obsessive interest.' He said that Ash-Smith 'savagely killed' Claire inside a dark alleyway on January 18, 1993 - just four days after her birthday - because he got a 'warped pleasure' out of her murder. He told jurors: 'Her assailant had stabbed her no less than nine times in what can only be described as a frenzied and remorseless attack by someone having nothing less than the intention of killing her. 'Make no mistake, this was a killing for the sake of killing, carried out by a ruthless and predatory armed killer, who attacked his chosen victim rapidly and stealthily, allowing her no time for defence or escape, and who fled the scene just as efficiently as he had arrived.' Ash-Smith was photographed at Claire's funeral just a month after he allegedly killed her. The court heard that he carried out similarly brutal knife attacks on other women - and plotted more. He also allegedly bragged about his attacks in journals which contained details of his 'Assault Plans'. School friends of Claire Tiltman - Philippa Fellows (left), Jo Roberts (centre) and Emma Edwards (right) arrive at Inner London Crown Court today for her trial - which is being held two decades after her death . In 1988, Ash-Smith tried to murder and rape a woman, stabbing her repeatedly in a savage attack. Ash-Smith was just 20 when he attempted to murder his first victim 'by strangling her, and by stabbing her several times in the back, and he had attempted to rape her. 'She had been lucky to survive,' said Mr Altman. Five years later he allegedly pounced on Claire, who he knew through family ties with the local Foreign British Legion club. 'The killing of Claire Tiltman did not end his spree, because two and a half years later in October 1995, when he was 27, the defendant attacked and stabbed another local woman some 360 metres as the crow flies from where the prosecution say he attacked Claire Tiltman.' He said that, like the schoolgirl's murder two years before, the attack was 'seemingly motiveless' and it was also 'a rare and exceptional event'. Ash-Smith pleaded guilty in 1996 to these other attacks. Flowers laid at the scene of Claire Tiltman's murder off London Road (A226) in Greenhithe, Kent . While in prison for the other two attacks he 'befriended a fellow prisoner to whom he confessed he was Claire Tiltman's killer', Mr Altman added. Jurors heard that Claire had been taking her mock GCSE exams around the time of her 'dreadful murder'. That evening, she left home at about 6pm to visit her friend Victoria Swift who lived less than a mile away, and who she was going to talk to about college choices. But in a decision 'that was to cost Claire her life' she took a quick detour to buy some cigarettes. She never arrived and was stabbed to death in an alleyway before staggering out bleeding onto London Road in the small town of Greenhithe. Mr Altman said: 'People thought she had been run over by a car but they soon came to realise that she had been the victim of a terrible crime. 'Nothing could be done to save her and Claire died from her wounds on her back on the pavement.' Michael Godfrey and another man, Ronald Wilson, were the first on the scene that evening. Mr Atlman said: 'She was on her knees facing [a] low wall with her left arm draped over it. A small pool of blood had settled on the wall. 'Mr Wilson thought the person had been a victim of a road accident. When he saw that she was covered in blood he ran across the road to summon and ambulance.' Pathologist reports at the time varied in whether Miss Tiltman had been attacked from behind or in front and detectives remain unsure of how Ash-Smith allegedly pounced. Mr Altman said: 'What may never be known, except to the man who attacked her, is whether Claire had entered the alleyway first and was then stabbed, or whether her attacker had dragged her in there and then stabbed her to death. 'Whichever it was, this was a brazen attack by someone with the confidence and resourcefulness to carry out a rapid, frenzied and ultimately murderous attack just off a busy main road.' The court heard that Kent Police launched a massive and long-running investigation to hunt down Claire's killer, but Ash-Smith has always denied her murder. Ash-Smith was arrested following his attack in October 1995, two years after Claire's death. Claire's parents Linda (left) and Cliff Tiltman (right) never gave up hope her killer would be caught but both have tragically passed away before seeing someone stand trial for her death . Mr Altman said police discovered Ash-Smith's 'Assault Plans' writings in which he bragged about his attacks - and plotted others. Mr Altman said that in those notes 'he had written about the attack in 1988 as well as other planned attacks that he had not completed'. He said Claire's killing was an 'entirely motiveless attack', and Ash-Smith got a sick thrill out of her killing. He said: 'There was no sexual interference and nothing was stolen from her. 'But to her killer Claire was a target for a completely senseless slaughter of an innocent young teenage girl, you might think for no better reason than the warped pleasure he derived from attacking a lone woman and the ultimate power and control it gave him.' At the time of the alleged killing he lived with longterm girlfriend Stella Murrell, who married in him in prison in 1997 but later divorced, and has since died. Mr Altman said: 'They went out together and she found him controlling, but despite this the relationship continued and eventually they lived together.' Ash-Smith denies the murder and has always claimed he has an alibi for the killing. Police tape off the scene of the murder in January 1993. Witnesses have described finding Claire's body and thinking she had been in a car accident . Jurors heard Ash-Smith was the son of former Labour councillor Diane and her husband Aubrey. His mother doted on him and refused to believe he could do any wrong - even after he was convicted for the other knife attacks, jurors heard. Mr Altman said: 'The defendant was... the golden boy in his mother's eyes who could do no wrong, even those offences of which he was convicted.' The fair-haired 46-year-old wore a pale pinstriped shirt and jeans as he sat in the dock flanked by three uniformed guards and stared straight ahead as details of Claire's murder were given in court. He spoke only to plead not guilty to murder in a clear voice. A group of Claire's old school friends sat in the public gallery as the historic murder case was opened. Claire's parents, Cliff and Linda, never gave up hope that the killer of their only child would one day be caught, but tragically Linda died from cancer in 2008 aged just 56. Plumber Cliff died in 2012, also from cancer, aged 63. The hearing has been adjourned until tomorrow.

"Former Arsenal striker Eduardo has announced his retirement from international football after blaming Croatia for depriving him of 'fair and honest treatment'. The 31-year-old claims that the involvement of officials . from outside the squad forced him to reassess his involvement following the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The Brazilian-born forward failed to make an impact at the tournament as Croatia were knocked out at the group stages after finishing third behind Brazil and Mexico. I'll get my Croat: Eduardo has announced his retirement from international football . Sharp shooter: Eduardo scored 29 goals in 64 games for the Croatian national team . 'I inform the Croatian Football Federation that I don’t intend to play for the team in which I played 64 times since the first appearance in 2004,' Eduardo said in a statement. 'I was selected 64 times in the last 10 years, from my first match for Croatia against Ireland in 2004. I scored 29 goals, which makes me the most prolific active striker in the team. 'During the past few years for me there were several very hard moments … which are consequences of activities of people who are formally not part of the squad but have a big influence on its work and officials. 'I believe that I’m deprived of a fair and honest treatment' he added. 'With great pride and joy I played in the Croatian shirt and presented Croatian football around the world. It was important to justify the trust that the fans gave me for which I am especially grateful. 'I’m in the team among players, coaches and many other people (medical staff, technical staff, and others) who are very much, everyone in their own way, important and I made many friends. 'I also thank all the coaches who had faith in me. I will remember playing for Croatia only in a nice way.' Horrific: The former Arsenal striker will be best remembered for breaking his leg against Birmingham in 2008 . Croatia manager Niko Kovac commented: 'Thanks, Eduardo. I wish him all the luck in the world for the rest of his career.' Arsenal signed the striker from Dynamo Zagreb for £7.5million in 2007. He scored seven goals in 41 appearances for the Gunners - but will be largely remembered for an horrific leg break following a challenge by Martin Taylor in a season defining game against Birmingham. Many cite the incident as the reason for Arsenal failing to maintain their lead in the Premier League title race that season.","Eduardo has announce his retirement from international football .

Several thousand protesters had marched through the capital yesterday, the day after street battles erupted during a mass rally by hundreds of thousands of people against what they see as a constitutional coup by supporters of Compaore. The legislature is due to examine a proposed amendment that would allow Compaore, now in the 27th year of his presidency, to run for re-election in November next year for another five years.

Government spokesman Alain Edouard Traore issued a statement Wednesday hailing the 'vitality' of Burkina Faso's democracy despite what he termed anti-government 'misbehaviour'. Compaore's bid to cling to power has angered the opposition and much of the public, including many young people in a country where 60 percent of the population of almost 17 million is under 25. Many have spent their entire lives under the leadership of one man and - with the poor former French colony stagnating at 183rd out of 186 countries on the UN human development index - many have had enough.

Compaore was only 36 when he seized power in a 1987 coup in which his former friend and one of Africa's most loved leaders, Thomas Sankara, was ousted and assassinated. The 63-year-old has remained in power since then, re-elected president four times since 1991 - to two seven-year and two five-year terms. In 2005, constitutional limits were introduced and Compaore is coming to the end of his second five-year term.

Many have spent their entire lives under the leadership of one man and - with the poor former French colony stagnating at 183rd out of 186 countries on the UN human development index - many have had enough . The opposition fears the new rules would enable Compaore to seek re-election not just once, but three more times, paving the way for up to 15 more years in power. The third largest party in parliament said at the weekend it would back the amendment, setting the ruling party on course to obtain the two-thirds majority it needs to make the change without resorting to a referendum as first promised. Protesters have erected barricades and burned tyres in the capital since the proposal was announced on October 21. Known in colonial times as Upper Volta, the landlocked country became independent from France in 1960 and its name was changed to Burkina Faso ('the land of upright men') in 1984, a year after a military coup.","Crowds of demonstrators smashed through heavy security cordon to storm National Assembly building in the capital .

"The German national team can have few keener admirers than Gordon Strachan. When he landed the Scotland job, the 57-year-old selected Joachim Low’s side as the pinnacle of the style of play to which he would aspire. The events of the past month underlined that as a canny choice. Strachan’s duties as a TV pundit meant he was close to the action in Brazil as the Germans swept all before them to lift a first World Cup in 24 years. Pondering: Gordon Strachan will have to work out a way to get points off the Germans in qualifying . They conceded just four goals in seven matches, with their 7-1 semi-final demolition of the hosts going down as one of the most extraordinary of all international results. It just so happens, of course, that Germany’s next competitive match comes against Scotland in the opening Euro 2016 qualifier on September 7. The trip to Dortmund will be the most daunting test yet of Strachan’s reign. Yet, while his respect for Low’s team is immense, it would be entirely wrong to suggest he is prepared to write off the fixture in any way. The national boss is adamant Scotland will be actively hunting points against the best on the planet. Nicking a result might just be the difference when it comes to the contest for second place in the group and guaranteed progress to the finals in France. Big task: They might be world champions but Strachan thinks Scotland can get points from Germany . Idols: Strachan, here promoting tickets for the qualifying games, is a long-term admirer of the world champions . ‘When was the last time Germany didn’t qualify for a championship? It just doesn’t happen,’ said Strachan. ‘But these are not free games. They are games where we can pick up points. ‘Over their qualifying campaigns, the Germans have dropped points. They don’t win every game but they somehow qualify for every tournament. ‘We want to be a team that is picking up something from Germany, home and away.’ It is not, therefore, just about turning up in the Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund and looking for a positive performance. ‘No, you always talk about a performance after you get beat,’ insisted Strachan. ‘We want to win. It’s like Brazil — they just wanted to win.’ Quality: Germany can boast arguably the world's greatest goalkeeper in Manuel Neuer . The Germans will play a World Cup Final rematch against Argentina four days before they take on Scotland. Strachan had no intention of accepting a similar friendly as he attempts to get his squad in the best possible shape. ‘I wanted the seven days to prepare for Germany,’ he insisted. ‘I didn’t want to play a friendly where I’d be thinking of resting some players and it wouldn’ t be the team I’d be playing against Germany. The players would know that themselves. ‘Then there would have to be a day of rest after the game and suddenly you’ve only three days to prepare. I thought it would be best to get the seven days with the players. That will help me over the campaign.’ Champions: Andre Schurrle lifts the famous gold trophy in Brazil . This will be the third  successive European Championship qualifying campaign — after meetings with Italy and Spain — in which Scotland have been grouped alongside the reigning world champions. Strachan feels it is a far tougher path than some nations who made it to Brazil had to travel. ‘I look at some of the teams in the World Cup and see the sections they’ve come from,’ he said. ‘If you look at our last draw (for the World Cup qualifiers), we had Belgium — who went to about top four in the world but who were pot three when the draw was made. ‘Then Serbia, look at their squad and see where those players are playing. Lazar Markovic has just moved to Liverpool for £20million. Everyone plays in the Champions League. Nobody will want Serbia in any draw now, trust me. Big fan: Strachan frequently spoke out about his admiration of the Germans while working for ITV . ‘And you’ve got Croatia who were third in the world at that time. That’s what we had as a qualifying group. I don’t care who you are — if you put those three teams together, you wouldn’t want to be in that group. Even Germany or England wouldn’t want that.’ Asked if he felt Scotland would have held their own at the World Cup, Strachan replied: ‘Aye. We are better than teams who were there. But they had a different way of getting through.’ World Cup hangover? Scotland will be trying to exploit any weakness when the two sides come together .","Strachan has long view the Germans as the pinnacle of football .

"A couple donned Santa costumes during their wedding ceremony before being waved off in a sleigh. Terminally-ill Harry Paul, 56, and Margaret Steward, 65, were joined by more than 50 guests in fancy dress outfits, including Snow White, elves and snowmen, at their party. The best man was dressed as a Christmas cracker, while two elf maidens were the bridesmaids and the seven dwarves even made an appearance. The happy couple: Mr Paul and Miss Steward donned their Christmas costumes for their wedding at Shire Hall Register Office, in Cambridge . Special day: The newly-weds were joined by guests dressed as carton characters and other seasonal figures for their party . The children dressed as a Christmas pudding and little elves with the family's dogs Marley, seven, and Layla, one, were Santa's helper and snowman outfits. Other guests dressed in costumes included Minnie and Mickey Mouse and the Stig from BBC's Top Gear. The extravaganza, which included children dressed as a Christmas pudding and little elves, was organised by Mr Paul's sister Anna Webster, 52, on a shoestring. The mother-of-two transformed her home in Willingham, Cambridgeshire, into a winter wonderland before the couple, who married on Saturday, left for honeymoon in a sleigh. Mrs Webster said: 'It was absolutely fantastic and we all had a great time. 'My brother and Maggie said it was a day they will never forget.' Fancy dress: The best man was dressed as a cracker while Mickey and Minnie Mouse also turned up to their celebration .

"It looks like an underground world that would work well as a movie location. But the 18-foot-tall female Atlas sculpture kneeling on the ocean floor off the coast of the Bahamas is not the work of fiction. Part of The Sir Nicholas Nuttall Coral Reef Sculpture Garden, the artwork was created by Jason deCaires Taylor, who previously put 500 life-sized sculptures in the waters surrounding Cancun, Isla Mujeres and Punta Nizuc. Scroll down for video... The female Atlas sculpture has been described by creator Jason deCaires Taylor as his 'hardest ever commission' It's a delicate operation as the Atlas sculpture, which was constructed underwater, is lowered back in . The female Atlas is out of her comfort zone as she is surveyed on dry land . Organised and curated by the Bahamas Reef Environment Education Foundation, the project aims to relieve pressure on natural reefs, which can be hotspots for environmentally-damaging tourism. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline Travel, Taylor said: 'It was one of the hardest commissions I have ever completed. Working on such a grand scale creates some very unique problems. 'The weight loading of 60 tonnes meant that the piece had to be created in sections and assembled underwater. Everything is a hundred times harder in the sea and getting precision parts together underwater was a huge challenge. 'The technique I used incorporated digital upscaling and a CNC routed mould which had never been done before in a marine environment, so it was the first time and quite nerve wracking. The cast of some of the parts of the statue, as the clean-up operation can begin . 'But I was very interested in working for a non-profit organisation that was completely dedicated to marine conservation.' 'Ocean Atlas' references the Ancient Greek sculpture of Titan Atlas holding the heavens but depicts a young local Bahamian girl sustaining the ceiling of the ocean. The largest sculpture ever to be deployed underwater it reaches from the sea floor five metres up to the surface and weighs over 60 tons. The sculpture, commissioned by Bahamas Reef Environment Educational Foundation, aims to create an underwater sculpture garden in honour of its founder Sir Nicholas Nuttall and includes other works by local artists Willicey Tynes and Andret John. The top of the structure, although at this stage forearm-less, is lowered into the sea . 'The coral reef sculpture garden can become a new environmental-friendly tourist and local attraction for The Bahamas once completed,' said BREEF executive director Casuarina McKinney-Lambert. 'The Coral Reef Sculpture Garden is the perfect fusion of art, education and marine conservation located in the world's most beautiful waters. By installing the eco-friendly artwork, beach-goers and snorkelers can now be redirected from natural reefs which will allow time for regeneration.' BREEF was founded in 1993 by the late Sir Nicholas Nuttall to focus on the education of Bahamian teachers about the environment and to address growing concerns on the state of The Bahamas' marine environment. The 'Bahamian Atlas' being prepared for it's journey into the sea . The Atlas sculpture has been joined underwater by 'Virtuoso man', a creation by Bahamian artist Willicey Tynes . Taylor is no stranger to underwater art. In 2006, he founded and created the world’s first underwater sculpture park. Situated off the coast of Grenada in the West Indies it is now listed as one of the Top 25 Wonders of the World by National Geographic. He also created MUSA (Museo Subacuatico de Arte), a monumental museum with a collection of over 500 of his sculptural works, submerged off the coast of Cancun, Mexico. Some 'furniture' that will help form part of the spectacular underwater garden off the Bahamas . The new work which during low tides will reflect a mirror image on the underside of the sea’s surface is a dramatic increase in scale from Taylor's previous works and ensures that even after substantial coral growth the figure will still remain recognizable. Following on from other projects the sculpture is constructed with sustainable materials and creates an artificial reef for marine life to colonise and inhabit, whilst drawing tourists away from over stressed natural reef areas. With our oceans and coral reefs currently facing collapse from numerous threats including; overfishing, ocean acidification, global warming and water pollution the piece symbolizes the burden we are currently asking future generations to carry and the collective responsibility we have to prevent its collapse.","Artist Jason deCaires Taylor's 'Ocean Atlas' part of the Sir Nicholas Nuttall Coral Reef Sculpture Garden .

"Boris Johnson has insisted he is a more serious politician than when he was last in the Commons – but admitted can still ‘drink an awful lot at lunch’ and work effectively. The London Mayor, poised to return to Westminster at the next election as David Cameron’s chief rival, rejected charges that he was ‘flakey’ as a Conservative frontbench spokesman – suggesting he was overshadowed by Tony Blair. ‘I don’t want to sound too defensive about it, but this is complete nonsense,’ Mr Johnson said. ‘We were in opposition when Blair was absolutely at the height of his game. I did have a variety of shadow ministerial posts, and one of them at least, I think, I did pretty well.’ Boris Johnson has insisted he is a more serious politician than when he was last in the Commons – but admitted can still ‘drink an awful lot at lunch’ and work effectively . But in an apparent attempt to burnish his credentials for high office, he went on: ‘I think probably it’s true that I have changed as a politician, yes. The experience of running London for six or seven years has shown me what you have to do to get things done, and the energy and the application you have to put into it.’ Mr Johnson, in a wide-ranging interview published today in the Radio Times, repeated his insistence that his several extra-marital affairs would make no difference if he wanted to be prime minister. ‘I fought two quite heavy-duty elections, which had quite a bit of national scrutiny, and I genuinely think that what people are interested in is how you are going to build more homes in London, fight crime, bridge the gap between rich and poor. 'Do you have a vision for society? Those things are a million times more important,’ he said. Mr Johnson admitted an ‘infantile desire for praise and admiration’ and talks of his admiration for Winston Churchill, the subject of a new biography by the Mayor. He conceded that in writing the book, he was inviting critics to point out the ‘superficial, absurd points of comparison that this buffoon wants us to draw out’ between him and Churchill. Mr Johnson expressed awe at Churchill’s ability to drink whisky from breakfast onwards, work all day in high office, enjoy a hearty dinner with claret and cognac, then at 10pm sit down to knock off 2,000 words of his latest book. ‘I mean, what was he on? How did he do it? He was incredible. I was trying to think of somebody in our profession that could do that still… I mean, I can drink an awful lot at lunch and then write very fluently and fast. But if I drink at dinner, it just peters off,’ he added. The Mayor claimed the wartime prime minister would have shunned Ukip, had he been alive. ‘I think he would have been a Tory, by today’s standards. I don’t think he would have been a Ukip man because he had a more generous conception of what it should all be about,’ he said. ‘If you read his European stuff, he’s pretty much all over the place but there is a consistency; he wants Britain to be involved. He would have wanted a renegotiation and I dare say a referendum too. All these, of course, are pretty idle speculations.’","He also rejected charges that he was ‘flakey’ as a  frontbench spokesman .

"It's a scene normally reserved for wildlife documentaries and blockbuster films. But three adult male gorillas were captured in an astonishing display of animal instinct - as they fought over breakfast at a Devon zoo. Kicking and hitting one another with their fangs in full view, the mammals stood upright as they carried out their hungry scuffle to the amazement of visitors. The stand-off was captured by a visiting schoolboy and wildlife enthusiast after keepers tossed vegetables into the animals' enclosure at Paignton Zoo. The four West Lowland gorillas  began fighting over a tomato after keepers tossed food into their enclosure at Paignton Zoo in Devon at breakfast time . The West Lowland gorillas put on an astonishing display as they fought over a tomato at Paignton Zoo, Devon, after keepers tossed fruit into the enclosure . A schoolboy with a season ticket to the zoo - which operates as a charity - was able to capture the astonishing moment using his digital camera . Owen Taylor was watching the West Lowland gorillas pad around their green enclosure when a single ripe tomato was thrown. Suddenly, three of the four animals started fighting over the fruit, bearing their long teeth and standing upright in a show of aggression. The 14-year-old, who has a season ticket to the zoo, captured the fight before normal order was restored. ‘I love photographing wildlife and I go to the zoo about twice a week to take pictures of the animals,' he said. ‘On this day I was there when the keepers were throwing food into the gorilla enclosure and it all just kicked off. ‘It was amazing to see and I got some good pictures I think. It is something I would like to make a career of, or perhaps work with animals in some way. 'I'm planning a trip to Exmoor Zoo as well to get some pictures.’ Paignton Zoo, which operates as a charity, is home to five male gorillas - Pertinax, Kivu, Kiondo, N'dowe and Matadi. The mammals all came to the zoo at different ages, with Pertinax joining in 1997 when he was 16. While all have different personalities, they all like their food as much as each other, keepers say . The mammals - Kivu, Kiondo, N'dowe and Matadi - all have their favourite foods and become excited when keepers toss the first meal of the day into their enclosure . They are part of a breeding programme which encourages adult males to live in a same-sex social group after being separated from their families . But Pertinax, the oldest of the group, was not involved. A spokesman for the zoo said: 'Having an all male bachelor group is an important part of the breeding programme because when young males grow up they need to leave the family but they also need to live in a social group. 'Youngsters come here to be brought up here in a group and Pertinax is sort of the boss. He's quite laid back but he keeps the younger ones in order. 'The aim is for them is to be good, real genuine gorillas. 'They've all got their favourite foods and when they're first let out in the morning there's a lot of grabbing and running around. 'They all have their quirks and their characters, they're very strong personalities.' In the wild, West Lowland gorillas eat low-growing leaves, herbs, stems and fruit and travel in groups. An average family is made up of adult females, four or five offspring of different ages and one male who protects the group.","Four male West Lowland gorillas started fighting over a tomato at Paignton Zoo in Devon .

"Wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has been pictured leaving hospital with her new baby daughter wearing a vest emblazoned with the slogan: 'The best things in life are free'. The mother-of-three, who shot to notoriety when she had a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, sold tickets to the birth of her child, and threatened to abort her unborn child to go on a reality TV programme, gave birth last night. Josie smiled and waved at photographers as she left St James's Hospital in Leeds, West Yorkshire, carrying her daughter, who was covered with a pink blanket, to a waiting taxi. This morning she posted a black-and-white photograph of her as yet unnamed baby's fingers clutching hers on her Twitter account, accompanied by three kisses, and tweeted throughout this morning in response to a number of well wishers. But the new mother - who already has two sons - was also pelted with online abuse after news of the birth broke. Scroll down for video . Wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has been pictured leaving hospital with her new baby daughter wearing a vest emblazoned with the words: 'The best things in life are free' The mother-of-three, who shot to notoriety when she had a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, was taken to hospital on Sunday . The mother has previously claimed to have sold tickets to the birth of her child, and openly smoked during pregnancy . Josie seemed in high spirits after the birth, waving to photographers as she made her way to a waiting taxi . After tweeting the picture, a number of users hurled abuse at her. It comes after Josie said she would set up a trust fund to pay for her unborn daughter's boob job - with money she had set aside to reimburse the NHS for her own surgery. But her most widely-reported outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Big Brother. A source close to the 24-year-old told The Sun she was thinking about naming the girl after Katie Price's daughter Bunny. After tweeting a picture of her new daughter's hand clutching hers, a number of users hurled abuse at her, suggesting she was an unfit mother . It's a girl! Josie Cunningham, pictured in hospital with her agent Rob Cooper, gave birth to her child last night . Her agent Rob Cooper posted a cheery photo on Twitter yesterday from her bed on a labour ward, saying: 'Not long till baby's here.......#Eeeeeek!' The birth came after Josie revealed she had been duped into thinking the child's father was Hull City captain Curtis Davies. Despite friends warning her the man might not be Hull's £2.2million central defender, she fell for the trick even after searching for pictures of the real footballer on Google. Josie said the father, who she began sleeping with after meeting him at a Leicester hotel in April last year, was 'IDENTICAL to the real Curtis - but turns out he is just a lookalike.' Duped: Josie (left) was fooled into thinking the baby's father was Hull City captain Curtis Davies (right) Girl power: The 24-year-old said this month she would set up a trust fund for her own daughter's boob job . Posting four pages about the situation on Twitter, she wrote: 'I feel so dirty, ashamed and devastated. I've been completely manipulated by a man for 18 months pretending to be a Premiership footballer. 'I feel physically fooled by him and had sex with someone who claimed to be someone he wasn't. 'I let a conman put his hands on me, kiss me with his lips and fill my head with lies.' She added: 'We wasn't in a full blown relationship, so I didn't see him too much, that's how he managed to keep the lie going. I know I'm not that clever.' Mr Davies, 29, who signed for the club last year, lives with his girlfriend Laura Dearn, 25. There is no suggestion he has been involved with Josie, and Hull City declined to comment. Mr Davies tweeted that he would not be responding to the 'non-story', and added that he was 'disappointed'. He said: 'My life goes on as normal' The episode is the latest in  an ongoing series of unusual dramas since Josie revealed she was pregnant. Fooled: The mother-of-three, who met the baby's father last year, said on Twitter that she felt 'physically sick' She reassured followers she had Googled Curtis Davies, but was still tricked into believing the man was him . Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother-of-two later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. She made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It came after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. Josie, from Leeds, made headlines after having £4,800 breast enlargement surgery paid for by the NHS . As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont). 'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice. Earlier this month, the mother-of-two stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. But, using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. The mother-of-two had earlier spoken of her devastation when doctors told her she was having a third boy. She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'. Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl.","Josie smiled at photographers as she left St James's Hospital in Leeds .

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers says the club tried 'everything' they could to keep hold of Luis Suarez before his £75million move to Barcelona. And Rodgers does not see Suarez's World Cup bite on Giorgio Chiellini as the reason behind his move. Barcelona announced on Wednesday that the controversial Uruguayan was '100 per cent' a Barca player, although the striker was conspicuous by his absence at a press conference. Pals: Rodgers congratulates Suarez after he scored a hat-trick against Cardiff last season . Latest star: Suarez's new No 9 shirt is already on sale at Barcelona's club shot at the Nou Camp . That was, of course, due to his four-month FIFA ban from all football-related activity after biting Italian defender Chiellini's shoulder. The incident, the third time in Suarez's career that he had been banned for biting, prompted many in the game to urge Rodgers to get rid of his star forward before the start of the season. But the Northern Irishman is adamant that the 27-year-old's exit was more down to his desire to move to Catalonia than his antics in Brazil. Thumbs up: Suarez pictured wearing the famous colours of the Catalan giants . Back in the day: Suarez at his Liverpool unveiling in 2011 - alongside Andy Carroll and Kenny Dalglish . Seeing is believing: Suarez was voted Player of the Year last season after a stunning campaign with Liverpool . 'We did everything we could as a club to keep Luis,' he told the Liverpool Echo. 'He wanted to go and play in Spain, and unfortunately when a player no longer wants to play for you, we need as a club to look at it. 'It was his decision for him to go, he's gone to Barcelona, a club he wanted to play for and now we'll move on. 'I'm not sure if he would have gone regardless of the World Cup. But I never felt that towards the end of the season, and likewise he never said he would give us another year either. He had obviously signed a new deal so we had that. Painful blow: Suarez's bite on Chiellini led to him getting his four-month ban from football-related activity . New boy: Rickie Lambert . New boy: Adam Lallana . New boy: Emre Can . New boy: Lazar Markovic . 'But I think we have had great service out of Luis and it's one that we can't worry too much about now, it's done, it's gone and our focus is here. 'There is a lot of work going on with the recruitment team in terms of getting in the right player and I am sure we can identify that. 'This club and many other clubs have shown over a period of time you move on, and believe me, it will be a really exciting season for us.' Suarez will be ineligible to play for Barca, who reportedly paid £75million for his services - or even to train with his team-mates - unless any appeal lodged with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is successful.

"Radio and TV personality Paul Murray has described the sending of an offensive tweet about his tragic baby son as a 'dog act'. Murray received the vile message from the Twitter account of a Labor Party member - who denied to Daily Mail Australia he was the person who sent it. The tweet read: 'Paul, is it OK to say now your dead son Leo is a grub and deserved to die? Just thought I'd match your editorial tonight. Reply pls.' Andrew McMicking, from Brisbane, said he was hosting drinks at his home to remember the late Gough Whitlam on Tuesday night when friends took his phone and sent the message to Murray about his son Leo, who died just after birth due to complications in 2012. An angry Murray told Daily Mail Australia: ‘You can say whatever you want about me personally and it’s water off a duck’s back, I’m in the opinion business. ‘But to unnecessarily involve my family, let alone attack the most precious part of my family, it’s a dog act. Labor party member and unsuccessful preselection candidate Andrew McMicking (right) has denied sending a tweet to radio and TV personality Paul Murray (left) taunting him about his dead son . ‘If there’s a person out there thinks who thinks what was said is OK there is something wrong with them.’ Murray said he had received an apology from Mr McMicking but he was sceptical of his explanation. ‘I don’t doubt the sincerity that he is very sorry that it happened last night but if he was the person who authored the tweet he should resign from the Labor Party and get out of public life,’ he said. ‘He claims the person who stole phone is no longer his friend, then why not name them? ‘How can I prove he didn’t have people there and it’s not a sincere excuse? It’s impossible.' Mr McMicking insisted he was not responsible for the tweet or other 'aggressive' texts sent from his phone. 'I deleted it as soon as I discovered it had been sent,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I have put an explanation on my [Facebook] page and wrote to Paul Murray first thing this morning offering my apologies and explaining the matter.' Mr McMicking did not respond to questions about who took his phone or why they sent the tweet. In the post on his Facebook page he wrote: 'Folks last night I had people over for drinks and to reminisce about Gough Whitlam. Fellow media personality Dan Ginanne condemned Mr McMicking on Twitter . 'A nice (and emotional) night for the most part, but then as the evening progressed some thought it funny to send out some (political/aggressive) texts and tweets in my name. 'These communications were completely inappropriate and not sanctioned by me at all. I sincerely apologise for any offence caused.

"A council inspector visited an 'exceptionally bad' building site hours before a trench collapsed and killed a father-to-be - but did not report it because the work was almost finished. The blunder emerged today at a second inquest into the death of Callum Osborne, who was 24 when he was buried alive more than three years ago in Swalecliffe, Kent. Colleagues desperately tried to dig out mounds of earth from around the labourer, but he suffered heart failure and was pronounced dead at the scene. Crushed: Callum Osborne was 24 about to become a father when he was buried by a collapsing trench in Swalecliffe, Kent. Today an inquest heard a council officer said the site was 'exceptionally bad' hours earlier . Desperate: Colleagues tried to dig out mounds of earth from around the labourer, but he suffered heart failure and was pronounced dead on the building site - which it has emerged a council officer said was 'dodgy' Today an inquest jury heard the site was visited by Canterbury City Council building inspector Julie Darbyshire earlier the same day. She felt it was ‘dodgy’ - but did not report it to the Health and Safety Executive, she told the jury. The 52-year-old said she took her decision because the work was almost finished, adding she did not have the power to shut down the site. On the day of the accident in April 2011 Miss Darbyshire said she could only get inside by holding a fence before she saw the trench with material piled alongside it. 'I saw a young boy digging in the trench close to a small digger,' she told the hearing. 'It was up to his shoulders. I would say it was up to five feet. 'I thought to myself, ""that looks dodgy"". It was an exceptionally bad site.' Killed: Callum Osborne with his girlfriend Colette Scott, who was eight months pregnant when he died . Pictured: Police at the site. Council building inspector Julie Darbyshire told the inquest: 'I saw a young boy digging in the trench close to a small digger. It was up to his shoulders... I thought to myself ""that looks dodgy""' The trench on the site, which was run by the Kent-based firm Coopers Services Ltd, was being dug to connect utility pipes from two new bungalows to the mains. The labourer from nearby Canterbury, whose girlfriend was eight months pregnant, was self-employed and had been working for the company laying pipes for just two days. His girlfriend Colette Osborne, who gave birth to their daughter a month after his death, said he had texted her two hours before his death to say he had not been given a break. She told the hearing: 'He said he hadn’t had a break yet. He said he was digging a trench and it was very deep. 'He’d spoken to me about trench collapses and said he wouldn’t work on a site where trenches were unsupported.' Long investigation: Police at the scene of the accident, which happened more than three years ago . Rescue: An air ambulance attended but Mr Osborne was pronounced dead at the scene. The inquest continues . But the mother-of-three added: 'He was desperate for this job and would do anything to get it, including working in a trench without shoring.' The inquest, which is being held in Sandwich, Kent, is the second formal hearing into the tragedy. The first collapsed in December 2012 without a conclusion, and a bid to finally resume the hearing in June this year was scuppered when an administrative blunder meant there were not enough jurors. The inquest continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Callum Osborne was 24 when he was buried alive in Swalecliffe, Kent .

"Britain will become more involved in the battle against Islamic State militants, but ground troops will not be deployed into Iraq and Syria, the Defence Secretary said today. Michael Fallon said the UK's involvement against IS fighters in Iraq will continue to be in a supportive role, by RAF planes taking part in air strikes, and helping to arm Kurdish troops. The Defence Secretary said western countries had learned from previous conflicts that the war against Isis would only be won by 'home troops', but that Britain and the U.S. can support them. Defence Secretary: Michael Fallon said the UK's involvement against IS fighters in Iraq will continue to be in a supportive role, by RAF planes taking part in air strikes, and helping to arm Kurdish troops . His comments come after Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, admitted there was nothing the international coalition fighting IS militants can do to make a fundamental difference in the battle for the strategically important Syrian town of Kobane. IS is threatening to overrun the lightly-armed Kurdish defenders of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey, despite United States air strikes on the extremists' position. The battle has sparked major protests in Turkey against its government's perceived inaction and US secretary of state John Kerry said he was deeply concerned about the situation. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fallon said neighbouring countries had a duty to stop Iraq and Syria 'falling apart', but stopped short of urging Turkey to get involved in the conflict. 'Turkey could help, but it's a matter for Turkey,' he said. 'Other allies have been helping, from the south Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia were helping with strikes. Strike: A picture taken from Turkey shows smoke rising after an airstrike, thought to have been carried out by a coalition plane on Islamic State targets in the west of Kobane, Syria . Fear: IS is threatening to overrun the lightly-armed Kurdish defenders of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey, despite United States air strikes on the extremists' position . 'This is a situation that can not be resolved by America and Britain. We'd like Turkey to be involved, but it's a decision for their government.' Mr Fallon said there had been talks with the Turkish government, and that Ankara is 'very aware' of the 'desperate' situation in Kobane. 'They will have to see whether they can help more,' he said. He added: 'Every country has its own position and comes to this from its own position. They have had difficulty with Kurdish extremism in the past, such as hostages. 'Every country in the region has got to see what it can contribute against ISIL or we will have Iraq falling apart and Syria falling apart and that's a danger for the entire region.' Mr Fallon said that it was in Britain's interest for Iraq and Syria not to collapse at the hands of IS, but said the Armed Forces would continue to act in a supportive role. Plight: Newly-arrived Syrian Kurdish refugees carry their belongings after crossing into Turkey from Kobane . 'There is a very direct British interest in making sure the Middle East does not fall apart, and that terrorism is not exported back to Western Europe,' he said. 'The legitimate government in Iraq will have asked for help, I don't think it would be right for Britain with its air power and other resources to stand apart and leave it to the Bahrainis or the Americans.' He added: 'We're not portraying ourselves as the saviours of the Middle East, we are helping.' Mr Fallon said ground forces would ultimately be the ones to push back IS, but maintained that British soldiers would not be involved in this. 'This can only be won in the end by ground forces, but it can only be won by the home army not an army from the West. 'That is the hard lesson we have learned. 'We can stiffen up the army, supply ammunition to Kurdish forces and use air power to provide support for operations on the ground. Help: A RAF Tornado GR4 returns to Akrotiri in Cyprus following an afternoon armed mission to Iraq . Air power: Mr Fallon said RAF flights have been flying on missions out of Akrotiri 'every day and night' 'We can help, and we should help. 'We have got to keep reviewing the campaign. At the moment we are here at the request of the Iraqi government and air power is a key part of that, as is stiffening up the Iraqi army and making sure it is properly equipped.' Mr Fallon also said British action would continue to focus on Iraq, rather than Syria. 'We have made it clear that ISIS has to be defeated in Syria and Iraq but we don't have the authority to support in Syria at the moment. 'There is plenty for us to do in Iraq and the RAF are flying missions every day and night. There is plenty for us to be getting on with in Iraq and pressure from ISIL is coming from bases in Syria. That's why we welcome what America is doing there.' He added: 'If we find there is a contribution we can make in Syria and it is lawful we can do it, but at the moment we don't have the authority from Parliament.' Asked if Britain would become more involved in the fight against IS militants he said: 'This is the international community's fight and the collapse of Iraq, or if Syria gets worse, that will affect us all. 'There could be terrorist strikes across Western Europe as (IS fighters) are returning to countries as far apart as Norway and Australia.' Mr Fallon said the proposal for a Turkish 'buffer zone' along the border inside Syria where refugees fleeing the fighting could be protected was being considered. He said that US special envoy to Syria, former general John Allen, would be holding talks with the Turkish government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to establish what contribution Ankara would make to the coalition. Foreign Secretary: Philip Hammond admitted that the coalition's focus on air strikes meant there was nothing it could do to make a fundamental difference in the battle for Kobani and acknowledged the town could fall to IS . 'We have the air power to help with it,' he said. 'That's something General Allen is discussing with the Turkish government today. Last night, Mr Hammond admitted that the coalition's focus on air strikes meant there was nothing it could do to make a fundamental difference in the battle for Kobani and acknowledged the town could fall to IS. He told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: 'The US has implemented some additional air strikes to try and help the people who are defending Kobani but it is a very difficult situation on the ground and we have never envisaged that the coalition's intervention with air power in this battle was going to turn the tide in the short term. 'We have got to degrade ISIL's military capability over time, that isn't going to happen overnight. 'So I don't want to suggest that there is anything readily that the coalition can do that will make a fundamental difference on the ground in this battle, in the tactical situation that's faced around Kobani.' He said: 'Self evidently it could fall. The Americans are committed to doing what they can to support the defence the town with additional air strikes. Cautious: US secretary of state John Kerry (right) and Mr Hammond (left) have reacted cautiously to a Turkish proposal to establish a 'buffer zone' 'But this is a long struggle here against a poisonous ideology and an organisation which has built up some very significant military capabilities. 'Although we the coalition are confident that we will win that strategic battle we cannot say with confidence that we will be able to win any specific tactical engagement.' Both Mr Kerry and Mr Hammond have reacted cautiously to a Turkish proposal to establish a 'buffer zone'. 'If Syrian citizens can return to Syria and be protected in an area across the border there's a lot that would commend that,' he said. 'But at the same time you'd have to guarantee safety, guarantee there wouldn't be attacks by the government. 'It needs a thorough examination.' Mr Hammond added: 'We would have to explore with other allies and partners what is meant by a buffer zone, how such a concept would work, but I certainly wouldn't want to rule it out at this stage.' Meanwhile, the Foreign Secretary sought to reassure the US that Britain would be prepared to join air strikes on Is militants in Syria, if requested by American commanders. Mr Hammond indicated ministers would be prepared to go back to Parliament to seek permission to extend British military action into Syria if US Central Command (Centcom) considered it 'militarily useful'. 'We absolutely have not ruled out playing a role in Syria,' he said. 'We will require further parliamentary approval if we decide that that is the right thing for us to do. 'We would see this as a military question - is there a militarily useful role that UK assets could play. 'If Centcom commanders see a specific role for UK military assets I am sure that they will not be slow in requesting them.'","Michael Fallon says British involvement in Iraq will continue to be supportive .

"When the most decorated Argentinian footballer in history makes a beeline for you to praise your side’s performance, you are generally on to a good thing. Ronald Koeman was delighted to be congratulated by Esteban Cambiasso after Southampton extended their best ever start to a top-flight season by inflicting another defeat on struggling Leicester. ‘Cambiasso came to me after the game and said, “What a good team you have”. That’s a big compliment from a great player and it’s very important,’ said Koeman. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Southampton vs Leicester City .

There is a dizzy whirl of people hankering to heap success on Saints and for good reason. Not only are they second in the table, just four points behind Chelsea, but they again extended the best defensive record in the top four. The stakes have been raised at Southampton. That much was clear as groans became louder and more guttural as the home side dominated Leicester but failed to find a breakthrough for more than an hour. It required substitute Shane Long to break the deadlock with his debut League goals for the club. The Ireland striker came off the bench after 68 largely uninspiring minutes and nabbed his first seven minutes later, before sealing all three points on 80 minutes. ‘We had to be patient,’ said Koeman, ‘It was difficult against a team with good organisation in defence and we lacked attention in the box and a final pass in the first half. But I said at half time, “Keep pressing and we will create, for sure we will score one or two times”.’ He was full of praise for Long, who had been dropped to make way for Sadio Mane after starting last week’s victory at his former club Hull. ‘It was great coming in from Shane, he made all the difference. Sometimes Shane is not happy [when he does not start], sometimes Sadio is not, but I like that in a player. Shane was brilliant today.’ Long made the breakthrough shortly after his introduction. Fellow substitute Jack Cork played in an arcing cross which was controlled by Graziano Pelle, who set up Long to expertly curl past Kasper Schmeichel into the far corner. Four minutes later the £12million signing, who has had a frustrating start to professional life on the south coast, added a second, finishing supremely after going one-on-one with Schmeichel. Koeman looked drenched but delighted at the final whistle, flinging off the red blanket he had draped over his knees in an attempt to keep warm. It appears he might be building something truly special at St Mary’s and more importantly, something that lasts. This was the week Southampton opened a £33m centre of excellence, named the Markus Liebherr Pavilion after the late Swiss businessman who bought Saints out of administration in 2009.

Sympathies have to be with the person forced to watch the first half of yesterday’s game again. As the rain lashed down, Southampton managed only one attempt on target in the opening 45 minutes, which was one better than the visitors. That effort came in the 21st minute and it was an ambitious one. Nathaniel Clyne responded to the crowd urging and unleashed a shot from 25 yards, but Kasper Schmeichel collected easily. Moments later, Leicester’s Jeff Schlupp did well to head behind after a brilliant Ryan Bertrand cross. While the Foxes remained steadfast they offered little going forward. A Wes Morgan header from a corner, which he directed high and wide, was their first real chance on 25 minutes. The second half heralded a more fluid Southampton. Pelle fired over on 49 minutes from a Tadic cross after he linked up with Mane superbly. The crowd were cheering when 22-year-old Mane finished from close range shortly after but he was rightly ruled offside, guilty of mistiming his run. Long popped up with his two and Leicester’s Chris Wood was heavily mocked by the crowd after missing a plum opportunity for a consolation goal, prodding the ball to the right of the target when one-on-one with Fraser Forster. Long almost got his hat-trick with the final touch of the game but hit the side netting — not that he will be too bothered about that. Leicester have now failed to score in their last five games and have collected just one point since their 5-3 win over Manchester United. ‘It’s a tough run for our players to deal with at the moment. It tests the resolve of everybody,’ said manager Nigel Pearson. ‘You’ve got to try to separate the psychological aspect of the players from how we play. Unfortunately we didn’t show enough quality. ‘I don’t accept the argument that it’s a great achievement to be here and that’s it. The combination of not keeping clean sheets and not scoring goals makes it very difficult.’ Sadio Mane (centre) thought he had put the Saints ahead in the second half but saw his strike disallowed .

"Eurostar has raised a glass – 515 of them, to be exact – to kick off its 20th anniversary celebrations as a high-speed rail link between London, Paris and Brussels. The company’s inaugural journey took place on 14 November 1994 and to kick off the countdown to its milestone birthday it set a Guinness World Record on Thursday for the largest champagne tasting event. Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc, who works with Eurostar’s kitchens to create seasonal menus, led 515 passengers through the tasting on board the 10:25 train from London St Pancras to Paris Gare du Nord. Cheers: Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc surprised the passengers on their two-hour journey to Paris . Travellers in all classes were served three types of champagne and a slice of opera cake – setting the record on UK soil – after they were surprised by Mr Blanc at the start of their two-hour journey. He hosted the tasting with Arnaud Goubet, his sommelier from  Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons in Oxford. Marc Noaro, Eurostar’s service and people director, said additional events and promotions will take place in Eurostar stations in the coming weeks.

The court heard how Wunderle, who lives with his mother in Waltham Abbey, had also coerced the girl into performing a sex act on him. Prosecution barrister Chris Stimpson said: 'He is 35 years old and a person of good character. 'The Crown will seek time to draft a sexual offences prevention order and a restraining order.' Wunderle pleaded guilty to five charges . Judge Neil Saunders adjourned the hearing for sentencing on November 14. Former pupils at the school in Essex include Alan Davies and tennis player Samantha Smith.

"One unlucky bride literally fell head over heels on her wedding day. Julia Magdaleno was getting ready to make her big entrance at her wedding reception at Jackpot Ranch in Camp Verde, Arizona, on October 11, when her new groom, Chad Kannard, decided to be spontaneous and pick her up in his arms as they sprinted into the tent holding all their guests. Things were going great for the first few seconds of their entrance, but then Chad, 27, dropped Julia to the ground, falling on top of her and causing brief panic among the guests.

Ain't love grand. In an interview with ABC News, Julia explained that the fall, which happened on a concrete walkway, looks far, far worse than it actually was. 'Both his arms went under me so really he took most of the impact. It looks like in the video he body slammed me but really, I really felt, like, nothing,' she said.

"Liberal Democrats have ‘rescued the country’ by helping secure the economic recovery, Treasury minister Danny Alexander boasted yesterday. In an interview yesterday, the Treasury chief secretary was ‘p****d off’ at the Tories claiming credit for tax cuts for low-income workers and Britain’s economic recovery. ‘The economic plan is just as much my plan as it is George Osborne’s,’ he said. ‘It is just as much a Liberal Democrat plan as it is a Conservative plan.’ In an interview yesterday, the Treasury chief secretary was ‘p****d off’ at the Tories claiming credit for tax cuts for low-income workers and Britain’s economic recovery . Speaking at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mr Alexander urged activists to claim credit for the recovery. The MP, who surprised activists by appearing at the podium without a jacket or tie, and with his sleeves rolled up, said: ‘We have rescued the country, and we need to summon up all our courage and resourcefulness to save it again, from a Labour party that would borrow too much and a Tory party that would cut too much.’ He went on: ‘We have rescued the economy, given opportunity to young people, cut taxes for millions of working people. This message needs to be told in every community, on every doorstep. Don’t be shy about it.’ Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg watches Danny Alexander give his speech . Mr Alexander said Labour and the Tories were like ‘two drunks fighting over the steering wheel’, with neither able to keep the economy under control. ‘Many would say we are the heart of this administration. It’s because we are in Government that we have an economic recovery.’ Mr Alexander said the Lib Dems would demand a new ‘fiscal rule’ after the next election that would require the burden of deficit reduction to be borne by the better off. He said the party would also invest billions more than the Tories in infrastructure. And he warned wealthy tax dodgers that the Treasury was coming after them. ‘We are using psychologists and behavioural economists in HMRC to get the money quickly,’ he said. ‘Tax dodgers beware - we know where you live, we know how much you owe, and now we know how you think. Your behaviour is unacceptable, and we are coming for our money.’","Treasury chief secretary said economic plan is just as much his as Chancellor George Osborne .

"Thousands of desperate homeowners with interest-only mortgages could forfeit their children’s inheritance in a bid to avoid repossession. Every year, half of those reaching the end of their interest-only home loan find they are unable to pay off their debt. Santander has become the first bank to announce it will offer lifetime mortgages – a form of equity release – for people in this position. The family home is then sold when they die and all or part of the proceeds handed to the bank to pay back the outstanding loan. Every year half of those reaching the end of their interest-only home loan find they are unable to pay off their debt (file picture) But experts warned that such schemes should only be used as a last resort and borrowers should discuss it with their families before effectively selling off the family silver. The lifetime loans are designed to help tackle a mortgage timebomb which could see families forced to downsize at the end of their fixed term or face repossession. Millions took out interest-only mortgages in the 1980s and 1990s. Monthly repayments are lower than with a traditional mortgage because only the interest, rather than any capital, is being paid off. However, that leaves the full loan to be repaid at the end of a typical 25-year term. But around half of the 85,000 loans of this kind which expire every year cannot be paid off in full, with the average shortfall in excess of £71,000. Around one in ten of those with such loans failed to plan ahead and save money into a repayment plan. Others bought an endowment policy, a stockmarket-linked savings plan designed to pay off the loan in full but which, millions have discovered, actually falls well short. Now those who find themselves with a shortfall could be offered the new deals. Santander said ‘a lifetime mortgage is one option we are considering for 2015’ in a bid to save families from eviction or being forced to sell their home and downsize to a cheaper property. Santander has become the first bank to announce it will offer lifetime mortgages – a form of equity release . Other major banks are also understood to be considering following Santander into the equity release market, which is dominated by insurance companies. Nigel Waterson, of the Equity Release Council, admitted that lifetime mortgages can cause tension with family members wanting to keep hold of their inheritance. He said: ‘The ombudsman receives very few complaints about equity release compared to normal mortgages, but those they do receive are mostly from sons and daughters, which is sad but not really surprising. ‘If the banks were to become a member of our council then we would require them to follow our strict standards and make sure borrowers have discussed their decision with family members.’ Lifetime mortgages will work like equity release, where homeowners use their property like a cash machine by borrowing money against the equity they have built up. The difference is that with traditional equity release, borrowers never repay the interest. With the bank loans proposed by Santander they will pay monthly interest until they die. The remaining debt will be deducted from the sale value of the property, leaving their children or grandchildren with a reduced inheritance. Banks are believed to be considering entering the market after changes to mortgage lending rules made it harder for interest-only borrowers in arrears to take out a new loan . Banks are believed to be considering entering the market after changes to mortgage lending rules made it harder for interest-only borrowers in arrears to take out a new loan – leaving more at risk of having their home repossessed. Previously, older workers unable to pay could switch to a repayment mortgage or extend their interest-only term – but many have been shut out by the tougher rules, designed to restrict risky lending, introduced in April. Andrew Montlake, a director at mortgage broker Coreco Group, said: ‘Lifetime loans will offer an alternative but you have got to be very, very careful before buying these types of products. When you are talking about inheritance intended for family members the subject becomes very emotive.’","Santander has become first bank to announce it will offer lifetime mortgages .

"Animal rights activists have warned people in China against giving money to beggars asking for money to help mutilated animals. These pictures claim to show a camel deliberately mutilated to get people to feel sympathetic and donate more money, apparently towards its upkeep. The camel and two beggars were photographed in the city of Fuzhou, Fujian province, south-east China, where police confirmed mutilating animals was now the new trend. Scroll down for video . Beggars belief: Two men kneel with their foreheads on the pavement as they ask for donations to help look after a camel with no feet. Animal rights activists say such beggars are scammers that mutilate animals . Mutilating people, they said, no longer seemed to gather as many generous donations, with people more often making a wide berth around limbless beggars. Police were unable to take any action against the gang as they hadn't broken the law. The camel has been used for begging since at least April and, according to local media, brings in lots of cash. The men claimed that the camel was a wild camel that they had rescued after it had been run over by a train. They denied mutilating it, saying they had taken it upon themselves to care for it and needed the money for food. But police say the story is a sham and it's almost certain the men or their contacts hacked off the camel's hooves themselves. Animal cruelty: The men claimed that the camel was a wild camel that they had rescued after it had been run over by a train. They denied mutilating it, saying they had taken it upon themselves to care for it . With just 600 wild camels left in north-west China's Gobi desert, and 800 in the deserts of Mongolia, their survival in the world is seriously at risk and they are supposedly strictly protected. In practice though there is rarely any action against people who trap the animals, mainly because of the difficulty in proving they are not domestic animals. The mutilation of this camel is the latest argument by animal rights activists for China to change the law on the torture of animals, in a country where cruelty to animals is not illegal. Change in the law: The mutilation of this camel is the latest argument by animal rights activists for China to change the law on the torture of animals, in a country where cruelty to animals is not illegal . Animal rights campaigner Xiong Kung said: 'You can see that the animal was obviously mutilated some time ago because the wounds are now healed. 'My information is that they get a large amount of money every day from people shocked by what they see and in effect they are rewarding these criminals for torturing the animal in the first place. 'But when police turn up all they can do is maybe move them on or fine them for begging, but nothing else. And that will remain the case until we get laws protecting animal rights.'","China has no law against cruelty to animals so these men can't be punished .

"Jailed: Karen Ackland, 44, has been sentenced to prison for having sex with a 14-year-old boy . A 44-year-old woman who has sex with an underage schoolboy has been jailed after judges overturned the original non-custodial sentence. Karen Ackland, of Deal, Kent, took advantage of a friend’s 14-year-old son after a drunken party, but was initially handed a nine-month suspended prison term. Court of Appeal judges in London today quashed the ‘unduly lenient’ sentence, replaced it with two years in prison. Ackland, a former sailor was sentenced at Canterbury Crown Court in July after admitting three counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child. The charges related to offences committed in April 2013 against the then 14-year-old son of a friend. The boy’s mother said: 'I never expected her to do this, you trust your friends. And he was just a child. 'She was always a party animal and when she had too many drinks she completely loses all self-respect and embarrasses herself. 'She used to always say 'I'm a nightmare when I've had a drink' and she'd always have a few men on the go. 'But I was a great friend to her and I stood by her. I never expected this. 'She was very domineering and my son said as soon as it happened that he'd wished he'd never done it.' Divorced mother-of-two Ackland was at a party in April two years ago when she met the schoolboy, who is now 16 years old. After hours of drinking the 44-year-old Tesco worker backed the helpless boy into a corner in the kitchen and they kissed. She tried to get the boy to walk her home on the pretext she had lost her phone, but his older brother refused to let him go. After hours of drinking the boy's mother offered Ackland a bed at their home, but as the boy went upstairs to get some tracksuit bottoms so he could change for bed, she sneaked into the room behind him. Abuser: The divorced mother-of-two from Deal, Kent, took advantage of her friend’s teenage son after a drunken party . Change: Canterbury Crown Court initially handed the Tesco worker a nine-month suspended prison term . Ackland, the mother of two teenagers, pounced on the boy and used him as her 'sex object' - until the boy's older brother heard noises and Ackland saying, 'I can't believe I'm doing this with a 15 year old!', and burst into the bedroom. Lord Justice Pitchford, sitting with Mr Justice Dingemans and Mr Justice William Davis, ruled today that the original sentence, which had been suspended for a year, was ‘plainly unduly lenient’. Announcing the decision, Lord Justice Pitchford said the court accepted that the offences were ‘out of character’, and committed ‘on one drunken evening’. Speaking after the hearing, Solicitor General Robert Buckland, said: ‘Karen Ackland, a 44-year-old woman, clearly took advantage of a teenager. ‘I note that the defendant pleaded guilty at a late stage in this case. I referred the case to the Court of Appeal as being unduly lenient because the original sentence failed to fully reflect the ages of the defendant and the victim. ‘I am therefore pleased the Court of Appeal today imposed an immediate prison term on Ackland, which should reassure the public and send out a strong message to women that teenage boys have a legal right to be protected from potential sexual interference.’ Ackland has also been ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register and pay £500 court costs.","Karen Ackland, 44, met her friend's son at a party, cornered and kissed him .

"YOU SAY POTATO by Ben Crystal and David Crystal (Macmillan, £12.99) Ozzy Osborne is known for his heavy Birmingham accent . In 1997, a hundred students were asked to listen to what they believed were tapes of the police interviewing various suspects — in fact, everyone concerned was an actor. The people playing the suspects either spoke in Received Pronunciation — BBC English — or with Birmingham accents. The students were then asked to say if they thought the suspects were guilty or innocent. It turned out they were twice as likely to convict someone who spoke with a Brummie accent. The reason was simple: the Brummies, they reckoned, ‘sounded guilty’. Somehow, I suspect that this won’t come as that great a surprise to anyone who doesn’t actually hail from Birmingham. The flattened vowels, the aggrieved uplift at the end of each sentence . . . Surely anyone who talks like this must have something to hide? But just a year after the experiment, a nightclub owner in Israel took out adverts in Birmingham papers for staff. Why? Because his clients couldn’t get enough of the accent. They thought it sounded cool and sexy. What’s going on here? Why do accents sound different to different people? And, more to the point, why do we speak with accents at all? The reasons, Ben Crystal and his father David believe, go back a long way. Trying to work out someone’s identity in the dark would have been a critical business for early humans. If you were sitting in a cave and you heard voices outside, you would want to know if they belonged to friends or foes. If they spoke the same way as you, it was probably safe to go out. If not, you’d best sit tight and keep your hands fastened around that club. Accents, of course, say an awful lot about us. They proclaim where we’re from, what class we belong to, our ethnic origins, even our educational history. They’re also something we judge people on — and our judgments tend to be as swift as they are unforgiving. Yet it doesn’t explain why Birmingham should be synonymous with shifty. In the Middle Ages there was no such thing as Received Pronunciation; everyone spoke with a regional accent. RP, as it’s known, was a reaction against Cockney. But Brummies can console themselves with the fact that though they regularly come top of polls to find the most unattractive accent in the UK, when it comes to sounding bolshy, Belfast stands supreme. Talking posh turns out to be a comparatively recent invention. In the Middle Ages there was no such thing as Received Pronunciation; everyone spoke with a regional accent. RP, as it’s known, was a reaction against Cockney. Essentially, it was everything Cockney wasn’t. If Cockneys dropped their h’s, polite society wouldn’t. If Cockneys put an h in a sentence where it didn’t belong — ‘I broke my harm’ — polite society took it out again. Skip forward 500 years and the wheel has come full circle. In the Eighties, people began to talk in Estuary English — the result of East Enders moving up in the world and wanting to sound less Cor Blimey. What they ended up with was a weird amalgam of Cockney and Received Pronunciation. As accents multiplied, so people became more and more adept at identifying them. George Bernard Shaw based Professor Higgins in Pygmalion — who claimed to be able to place a person’s origins within six miles, and sometimes within two streets in London — on a real-life professor of phonetics at University College, London. It was only a matter of time before phonetics went into showbusiness. In the Forties, a radio series went out in the U.S. called Where Are You From? in which a man called Henry Lee Smith would try to identify people’s accents. Guests were given a list of 20 words to say, including ‘very’, ‘wash’ and ‘greasy’. Smith regularly got seven out of ten correct. David Crystal is Honorary Professor of Linguistics at the University of Bangor, and Ben is an actor who curated the British Library’s CD, Shakespeare’s Original Pronunciation. For some reason — presumably because they thought it would make everything sound bright and snappy — their narrative keeps switching from one to the other, with cheery little sign-offs such as: ‘Over to you Pops.’ Although this works surprisingly well at first, it soon runs out of steam. Yet there is still a lot of fascinating stuff here. Plainly, we’re all obsessed by how we speak, even if — thanks to U.S TV — we’re increasingly shifting westwards. How many people now say ‘skedule’ instead of ‘schedule’? Linguist David Crystal (left) and his son Ben (right) explore why we're obsessed with how we speak . At the same time, attitudes to Received Pronunciation are changing. Once it was the embodiment of decency and trustworthiness. Now it’s more likely to be seen as ‘distant’ and ‘customer unfriendly’. Some things, though, never change: snobbery and a desire to escape one’s background being two of them. In 2012, a British private tuition company announced it received far more requests for elocution lessons than any other subject. So if you happen to be sitting on a bus on, say, the Birmingham inner ring road and hear someone reciting ‘how now brown cow’ over and over, don’t judge them too harshly: they’re only following a natural human impulse.","A nightclub owner in Israel took out adverts in Birmingham papers for staff .

"A woman who was worried about her grandmother when her flight became delayed at JFK airport used the help of a stranger on social media to make sure she was alright. Leila Wons' 88-year-old grandmother Rosa Levy had been traveling from Argentina to Boston to visit her family. But when her granny's connecting flight was severely delayed  at JFK airport she began to panic when she could not locate her and put out an S.O.S on social media for help. Grandmother: Rosa Levy, 88, had been traveling from Argentina to Boston to visit her family but her family became worried after her flight was delayed at JFK airport . ‘She was going back to her home [Argentina] and from Boston was supposed to connect from New York,’ Wons told ABC news. ‘She was supposed to get to the flight to Argentina at 10 p.m. and it was delayed to 8 a.m. the next morning.’ ‘It's difficult for her to communicate,’ Wons said. ‘The issue was that the airline didn't keep a record of what hotel they were sending her to and we couldn't find where she was.’ Wons, who does not live close to New York, used social media to connect with former students at her old college - Wellesley College - to ask for help. Soon, Maryann Ford, 47, a fellow Wellesley alumna who lives in Manhattan, read Wons' call for help via social media. Ford told ABC News: ‘I was on my way to sleep and a Wellesley friend tagged me in a post, asking if I could help.’ ‘I got out of my PJ’s, threw on some sweats, and hopped in a cab to JFK to find her.’ Deserted: With a digital picture of Wons’ grandmother in hand, Maryann Ford asked if anyone had seen Rosa Levy in the near-empty airport . Found: After a few phone calls airline employees helped Ford, left,  locate a surprised Rosa Levy, right, . With a digital picture of Wons’ grandmother in hand, Ford asked if anyone had seen Rosa Levy in the near-empty airport. She was in luck when airline employees, got in touch with a Holiday Inn, where she called for police assistance to help find Levy. Wons said: ‘It was 4 a.m. and my grandmother was getting on the shuttle to the airport. That’s when Maryann saw her.’ After putting their worries at ease, Wons said Ford's act of kindness made her feel incredibly grateful, especially as they had never met each other. She said her grandmother had been visiting the country every one to two years for the past 20 years but had never experienced any real delays, so Ford's gesture put their minds at ease. ‘She’s an angel,’ said Wons. ‘I couldn't have imagined that somebody I never met would do this.’ But Ford thanks social media. She said: ‘Social media made this possible it was so great to continually check this thread and read the suggestions people made on what my next move should be, and how I could find this person.’ ‘It didn’t matter if I didn’t know [Wons] or her grandmother because this isn't about me. I feel like this is kind of what we are supposed to be doing in this world is helping each other,’ Ford said.","Leila Wons' 88-year-old grandmother Rosa Levy had traveled from Argentina to Boston to visit her family .

"Comic Con 2014 came to a close on Sunday but what a fun couple of days it was for the attendees who dressed in their finest costumes over the four day event at the Jacob Javits Center in New York. The event, which kicked off last Thursday, attracted some 150,000 people – many donning elaborate and often skimpy – costumes in homage to their comic book favorites. Sunday saw guest appearances from William Shatner and Hulk Hogan among the screenings, panels and book signings at the biggest event in the comic book aficionado's calendar. Scroll down for video . Comic Con 2014 came to a close on Sunday but what a fun couple of days it was for the attendees - many of who dressed in their finest for the four day event at the Jacob Javits Center in New York . Comic Con 2014 kicked off last Thursday and was  attended by more than 150,000 people – many donning elaborate, often skimpy – costumes in homage to their comic book favorites . One of the more bizarre costumes photographed at Comic Con on Sunday was Bill Cipher, left, from Disney's Gravity Falls, while more familiar characters included the X Men's Kitty Pryde and  Iceman, right . The Comic Con attendee on the left appears to have come as a mix of his favorite Johnny Depp characters including bits of Edward Scissorhands and Captain Jack Sparrow, while Chewbacca, right, loses his cool after being asked to pose for another photograph . From midday on each day of the five day extravaganza, streams of men, women and children - some still in pushchairs – have streamed into the exhibition room dressed as characters from movies, books, and video games. This year's event also included 800 exhibitors, 400 panels and 600 artist signings. There was even a faction of people protesting against Ben Affleck being cast as Batman in a 2016 comic movie: Batman v Superman. As ever, numerous women came scantily clad like their favorite characters - some wore little more than panties and tape. It is a controversial issue that has plagued the event for years as many cosplayers complain they are fondled and intrusive photos are taken of them and later posted on the internet. In a bid to tackle the controversy, organizers this year hung posters warning people that 'cosplay does not mean consent', that they should keep their hands to themselves, and ask for permission before taking photos. One comic-mad mom brought along her young baby in matching costume, left, while the Joker checks his cellphone, right . For many attendees, Comic Con isn't all about the famous names and exclusive previews but is also a chance to dress up as your favorite comic book character and ham it up with the other visitors.

Last year, New York Comic Con generated more than $70 million, according to the New York Times, and tickets sold out within minutes for the event. It has even spurned a secondary ticket market, with people selling their entry passes online for triple the price. According to Alex Fensterman, the creator, New York Comic Con is 'a reflection of New York City' and, compared to the unaffiliated San Diego version, 'a little bit less Hollywood focused, a little bit more comic book, publishing, television focused.' Fans were treated to a surprise at the presentation of Tomorrowland when George Clooney crashed the event on Thursday. Other highlights over the weekend included actor Bill Nye signing autographs for fans and a panel featuring the creators and actors from AMC's Walking Dead. Fans can also shop for collectibles. Digg compiled the most valuable items for sale, including the highest-valued comic, the first Action Comics issue held by Bryan Menegus, valued over $3million.

"David Rennison is from the Royal British Legion in Chapeltown, South Yorkshire,  where members were left 'shocked' and 'upset' after a collector was turned away from their local Asda store. Asda bosses forced a British Legion poppy seller to leave their store - because it clashed with the rota of other charity collectors. The shocked collector was unexpectedly marched from the  supermarket in Chapeltown, South Yorkshire, and told not to return for a week. David Roussell, local Legion secretary, said: 'We were shocked a poppy seller had been turned away and she was upset at being asked to leave the store. 'We always collect at the Asda store for two weeks, so not allowing us to collect there for one of those weeks could affect our collection total. 'We send letters to supermarkets around July letting them know we intend to collect, and someone went and agreed it verbally at the Asda store,' said Mr Rousell. Collector Jacqueline Stenton was representing the British Legion at the supermarket when she was unexpectedly turned away on October 25. Asda managers said they couldn't allow a poppy seller that week because it clashed with a calendar of other charity collectors who stand outside the store. Mr Roussell said the store had always allowed poppy sellers in the past and collectors had not had any trouble until Ms Stenton was turned away. An Asda spokesman confirmed its stores have a calendar of charity activity to avoid clashes. 'Across October our stores fundraise for Breast Cancer Awareness month, and there were also two local charities collecting in store at this time. 'As per every year the Royal British Legion is welcomed into our stores from November 1 to 11. We're pleased the team has been in store since Saturday.'

"A  rail passenger was handed a bill of more than £1,000 by ticket inspectors - after he and his family boarded the wrong train to London. The man, in his 40s, was travelling from Birmingham New Street to London Euston with 38 of his family and friends who had each purchased London Midland only tickets. But they accidentally boarded the faster, and more expensive, Virgin Trains service. Shock: A rail passenger was handed a bill of more than £1,000 by ticket inspectors - after he and his family boarded a Virgin Trains service to London, having bought London Midland only tickets . Ticket inspectors discovered the family’s mistake on the 10.30am service on Monday  when it pulled into Coventry. They gave the group the option of paying £800 to travel to the next stop - 100 miles away in Watford  - or face an even heftier fine and prosecution through the courts. The party eventually agreed to pay £1,048 to complete their journey to London Euston, an average of £26.87 per person. A fellow passenger who witnessed the inspectors confront the head of the family said: 'It was a pretty heart-stopping moment.

The revenue protection policy at Virgin Trains states that it issues Unpaid Fare Notices (UFNs) to customers travelling without valid tickets who are unable to pay at the time. A spokesperson for Virgin Trains said: 'If people are travelling in large groups we encourage them to make the most of our group offers; on our Birmingham to London route, fares would start at £7.50 for an adult single fare (£3.75 for children). 'That would mean all 39 could have travelled for a maximum price of less than £300. We run three trains an hour between Birmingham and London Euston, with journey times of one hour 25 minutes.

"Seven people accused of witchcraft were hacked with machetes and burned alive by a mob of villagers in Tanzania, police said. Five of those killed were over the age of 60, while the other two were aged over 40, according to police chief Jafari Mohamed. Mr Mohamed, whose force oversees the country's western Kigoma region, said that 23 people had been arrested in connection with the crimes. Among those arrested on suspicion of carrying out the killings was the local traditional healer, or witch doctor.

Among those arrested on suspicion of carrying out the killings was the local traditional healer, or witch doctor. Relatives of the victims said that their family members were hacked with machetes or burned almost beyond recognition. Josephat John, whose parents were killed in the attack, told Tanzania's Mwananchi newspaper: 'When I returned home in the evening, I found the body of my mother lying 10 metres away from our house, while the body of my father was burnt inside the house.' The assault in the village of Murufiti took place on Monday but reports only emerged after police announced the arrest of the suspects. Mr Mohamed said: 'We are holding 23 people including local leaders in connection with the attack. They will appear in court to face murder charges.'

Above, a file image of shamans dancing a ritual in front of residents in a village in Tanzania . One local human rights group, the Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC), has estimated as many as 500 'witches' are lynched every year, based on reports that counted some 3,000 people killed between 2005 and 2011. Many of those killed were elderly women, the centre said. The group said some are targeted because they have red eyes, which is seen as a feared sign of witchcraft. But reddening of the eyes can be caused by the use of dung as cooking fuel - a necessary method in impoverished communities. The centre said that many local people believe that witchcraft is behind every misfortune - from infertility and poverty to failure in business. Past attacks have included a series of bloody assaults against albinos, as well as against young children. In Tanzania, albinos are killed and dismembered because of a widespread belief that charms made from their body parts bring good fortune and prosperity.","Five victims were over the age of 60, while the other two were over 40 .

"A top civil rights lawyer has  been accused of raping a woman at his Manhattan home after Rev Al Sharpton's star-studded 60th birthday party. Sanford Rubenstein, 70, a high-powered attorney in New York, is said to have sexually assaulted the victim at his luxury apartment after the event at the four-star Four Seasons restaurant earlier this week, according to the New York Daily News. Sources told the paper the rape of the woman, who is believed to be a 42-year-old executive with links to Sharpton, is being investigated as third degree. Allegations: Sanford Rubenstein, 70, a high-powered attorney in New York, is said to have sexually assaulted the victim at his luxury apartment after Rev Al Sharpton's (right) 60th birthday party . The charge is brought when the victim is 'incapable of consent', which means she could have passed out or was very drunk at the time. However Rubenstein, who has appeared as a legal analyst on CNN and MSNB, is yet to have been charged in connection with the encounter. The NYPD would not comment on the case while Rubenstein's law firm are yet to provide a statement on the story. The civil rights organisation National Action Network released the following statement: 'National Action Network and Rel Al Sharpton has not been notified or advised by any official investigating authorities. 'The allegations as reported occured at a private residence after a NAN even and had nothing to do with NAN nor Rev Al Sharpton, therefore we have no comment at this time.' The likes of Mayor de Blasio, Gov. Cuomo, director Spike Lee and legendary singer Aretha Franklin were at Sharpton's soiree on Wednesday night. Rubenstein is well-known in New York and has been involved in a number of high profile cases. Recently he was chosen as the attorney for Sandra Amezquita, a heavily-pregnant woman who claims NYPD officers threw her to the ground belly-first during an arrest. Spotlight: The civil rights lawyer (right) has represented claimants in a number of high-profile cases. Here he is with Esaw Garner, the wife of Eric who died in a 'chokehold' by an NYPD officer on Staten Island in July . He is also representing the family of Eric Garner, who died after police officer held him down in what appeared to be a chokehold during an arrest on Staten Island in July. His wife Esaw attended Sharpton's bash. He has said his death should help try to improve police policies and practices. According to a profile on the website of his law firm Rubenstein Rynecki: 'The senior partner... is one of New York's most sought-after advocates for victims' rights in personal injury and civil rights matters . 'Appearing frequently on national and local TV News, he has been quoted in all of New York’s daily newpapers. Rubenstein has been a guest advocating victims rights on Good Morning America, Larry King Live, Geraldo at Large, Inside Edition and Montel.' He represented police-torture victim Abner Louima in his civil suit against the city. The case was settled in July 2001 for a stunning $7.1 million, the largest police brutality payout in city history at the time. In 2010, he published a memoir self-titled Outrageous Rubenstein.","Sanford Rubenstein, 70, allegedly assaulted woman in his Manhattan home .

"George Osborne was today accused of ignoring a 'mega problem' with the nation's finances as the amount of taxes which went unpaid rose to £34billion. The so-called 'tax gap' in 2012-13 rose to 6.8 per cent of all taxes owed going unpaid, thanks to evasion, avoidance, error and criminality. Ministers admitted there is 'still more work to do' to deal with the problem, but the head of the Commons spending watchdog warned law-abiding taxpayers are 'losing out massively'. Scroll down for video . The amount of unpaid tax rose to £34billion in 2012-13, HM Revenue and Customs admitted today . The biggest slice of unpaid taxes was attributed to income tax, National Insurance and Capital Gains Tax . New figures from HM Revenue and Customs show that £1 in every £15 owed in taxes was not collected last year. The gap had been shrinking, but last year hit the highest level since before the coalition was formed, topping £34billion. Some 6.8 per cent of tax that was due was not collected in 2012/13, compared to 6.6 per cent in 2011-12, resulting in an increase of £1 billion in the gap. The increase in the overall tax gap was due to an increase in the VAT gap of £0.9 billion and an increase of £0.3 billion in uncollected tobacco duty. Ministers insisted that the gap was lower now than under Labour but critics seized on the figure to claim the Government was failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the powerful Public Accounts Committee, told MailOnline: 'It is a mega problem that has got worse and this is a very conservative figure. The taxpayer who pays their proper taxes is losing out massively. 'I am worried that what is happening with the HMRC and the government is they talk the talk but they don't walk the walk. 'They say they are committed to tackling the tax gap, they say they are committed to accuracy, better control of their figures and customer service. 'But then we have to find out that things are much worse than they admit to. 'The health service has got a gap of £30billion. It is a big elephant in the room. The government is not facing up to that and if they just got on top of the tax gap, they could protect the NHS.' The long-term trend is downward, with the tax gap falling from 8.5 per cent in 2005/06, HMRC insisted. HMRC attributed £3.1 billion of the gap to tax avoidance, down from £3.4 billion. Some £14.2 billion of income tax, national insurance contributions or capital gains tax went uncollected, along with £12.4 billion of VAT. Corporation tax made up £3.9 billion of the gap, with excise duties accounting for £2.9 billion. Financial Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said: 'Since 2010-11 the percentage tax gap has stayed lower than at any point under the previous government, saving the country £4 billion. 'Today's figures show that there's still more work to do but our continued drive to tackle avoidance means that avoidance is down. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, warned Chancellor George Osborne warns failing to tackle the problem of the tax gap . 'In 2012-13 HMRC achieved a compliance yield of £20.7 billion, rising to a record breaking £23.9 billion in 2013/14. 'The UK has one of the lowest tax gaps in the world but HMRC will continue to deploy its resources and skills to maintain the downward pressure that has proved so effective in recent years.' Labour's shadow exchequer secretary Shabana Mahmood said: 'These damning figures show that this Government is totally failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion. A squeeze on wage growth helped blow a £25 billion hole in income tax receipts for the last financial year compared with expectations at the time the Coalition came to power, the Government's budget watchdog said today. Britain's deficit of £108billion for 2013-14 was £48 billion larger than predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in June 2010. In an evaluation of its earlier forecasts, the OBR said the single largest factor in its over-optimistic prediction was the shortfall in income tax. The body said this reflected lower wages and salaries and a lower effective tax rate on that income - with the level of tax-free personal allowances increasing. National Insurance contributions were also £7.4 billion below forecast. 'According to HMRC's own assessment, the amount of uncollected tax rose again last year and has now gone up by £3 billion on George Osborne's watch. 'At a time when working people face a cost-of-living crisis, our NHS is going backwards and the deficit is still high, it's even more vital that everyone pays their fair share of tax. 'Labour has set out a clear approach to tackling tax avoidance, including measures to help raise revenues for our National Health Service. In contrast, George Osborne is failing to tackle the tax gap while giving the top one per cent of earners a £3 billion a year tax cut.' It came on the day HMRC said it would close another 14 offices and cut more than 400 jobs. The Public and Commercial Services Union claimed that more than 1,000 jobs would be lost – and warned it did not make economic sense to impose cuts on the department that should be collecting revenue. Chas Roy-Chowdhury, of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, said ordinary people were ‘an easier target’ than those who set out to cheat the system. Almost £24billion of the tax gap was from businesses – suggesting that the Government must tackle the complex tax-avoidance schemes used by multinational corporations. Shabana Mahmood MP, a Labour Treasury spokesman, said yesterday: ‘These damning figures show that this Government is totally failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion.’ But David Gauke, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said that since 2010-11 the percentage tax gap has been lower than under Labour. He said: ‘Today’s figures show that there’s still more work to do but our continued drive to tackle avoidance means that avoidance is down. ‘The UK has one of the lowest tax gaps in the world.’","6.8% of all taxes owed were not paid in 2012-13, HMRC admits .

"Star sing-along: Wayne Rooney took part in an extraordinary duet with his idol Ed Sheeran in Manchester last week . Wayne Rooney became a pub crooner after agreeing to a duet with superstar Ed Sheeran during a late-night drinking session, new footage revealed today. The England and Manchester United captain was filmed as he warbled his way through Sheeran's hit Lego House during a sing-along after the musician's sell-out gig in Manchester last week. He joined Ed for drinks at the Sir Ralph Abercromby pub but when Ed pulled out his guitar Rooney was keen to sing with him. The millionaire footballer sat on a stool with a pint of lager on the table next to him, and at times closed his eyes and clasped his hands together as he sang one of his favourite songs. The crowd joined in although at times those watching could be heard giggling as Rooney struggled to hit some of the notes. Wayne, 29, later documented their late night drinks by sharing a fun post-show snap with his 10.1 million Twitter followers. The Manchester United forward is known for his love of music and has the title of the Stereophonics' album Just Enough Education to Perform tattooed on his arm. One person who saw Rooney sing last week told The Sun: 'Everyone was singing along and laughing but he showed he can take a joke. 'It was like a normal group of mates messing about in a pub but I'd definitely advise him not give up the day job.' Pub landlord Mike Christodoulou said: 'Ed pulled out his guitar and him and Wayne had a little sing song — it was good vibes all round.' Scroll down for video . Unlikely alliance: Manchester United striker Rooney sat down as Sheeran strummed his guitar and joined in to during the performance of his hit Lego House, sometimes closing his eyes as he sang . Having fun: Rooney and Sheeran have become friends and arranged to meet for a drink after the gig . Lads: Wayne Rooney and Ed Sheeran enjoyed a night out at central Manchester pub The Sir Ralph Abercromby following Ed's gig at the city's Phones4U Arena earlier that evening . Thanks mate: Wayne acknowledged his night out with Ed in a tweet shared with his 10.1 million Twitter followers . Music lover: Wayne Rooney's got previous for singing in public - pictured here in a Barbados night club three years ago during a set including Yesterday and We Are The Champions . And this is not the footballer's first gig, having been filmed doing karaoke in the past. In 2011 he did a seven song set while on holiday with his wife and children in Barbados. He belted out Queen hit We Are The Champions and Yesterday by The Beatles after asking people for requests. He later tweeted: 'Having a great night in Barbados! In lexys piano bar with ColeenRoo and friends. Been on the mic for about 7 songs and felt like a rock star'. But Wayne has also suffered from stage fright, having admitted in the past he didn't sing the national anthem at football games because he never learned the words. The star was criticised for being unpatriotic because he did not sing a single word of 'God Save The Queen' when lining up for his country,  but explained he was never taught the song. After his duet with Sheeran the footballer tweeted: ‘Brilliant time at @edsheeran concert last night. Thanks for a great night mate.’ Sheeran has become a Premier League phenomenon. Top referee Mark Clattenburg was dropped from the top flight's list of officials at the weekend after breaking protocol and travelling to see him in concert in Newcastle straight after a game. The referee drove alone to take charge of West Brom's home game against Crystal Palace on October 25 - a move engineered in order to see the award winner perform at the Metro Radio Arena. Arsenal defender Calum Chambers has also seen Sheeran perform recently. Venue: The Sir Ralph Abercromby in central Manchester was the venue for Rooney's impromptu gig . He's off: Manchester United striker Wayne checked messages on his phone after leaving the Ed Sheeran gig in Manchester on Tuesday evening before they met at a local pub . Hello Manchester: Ed posted a stage shot of the screaming crowd during his gig at the cavernous Phones4U Arena . Meanwhile Ed, 23, updated his own account with a shot of the audience taken from his stage vantage point with the message: ‘Manchester #1.’ His own life has been transformed by his success, going from being homeless to earning wages on a par with top footballers. Although his friend Wayne Rooney earns £300,000 a week, Sheeran's music is said to bring in around £85,000 a week for him. The Suffolk boy made £4.5million in 2013 according the Companies House and his highly-rated album X is the biggest seller of the year. Rooney’s appearance at Sheeran's gig came days before her played in the Manchester derby where his side lost 1-0 to rivals City. Rooney, who celebrated his 29th birthday days earlier on October 24, had remained in Manchester while wife Coleen and their two sons, Kai, two, and 17-month old Klay, enjoy a half-term break in Barbados. The WAG has been sunning herself on the West Indian isle, where the Rooney’s own a holiday home, on what amounts to her 10th overseas holiday in a year.","The England captain agreed to sing Sheeran's hit Lego House in packed pub .

"He has admittedly publicly that the White House underestimate the terror threat from ISIS. But Saturday Night Live took Obama's confession a step further - by having him admit that jihadists outperform the U.S. government on Twitter. The comedy show had performer Jay Pharaoh play the President in a sketch going into detail on how jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq have him on the ropes when it comes to hashtags, emojis - and even dating apps. In his best Obama voice, Pharoah took part in a 60 Minutes-style interview which also made light of recent failures in the Secret Service - and the Ebola crisis. 'They can maximize faves': Jay Pharaoh played Obama - and admitted that ISIS had outfoxed the administration on social media . Mocked: 'Obama' confessed that terrorist Twitter accounts had baffled him - and lamented their skilled use of emojis . At the opening of the NBC show, Beck Bennett, posing as CBS host Steve Kroft, asked how the Obama administration had been outfoxed by ISIS. In reply, the 'President' said: 'We underestimated how effective ISIS would be at social media - they really blew us out of the water. 'These terrorists have nothing to do - they can be tweeting all day. They can maximize faves as well as RTs. Faux serious: Beck Bennett pretended to by 60 Mintues host Steve Kroft for the skit . 'Why was the CIA on Tinder?' The sketch also coined the acronym D.T.J. - Down to Jihad . He then threw out some examples, exposing their 'tactics' of using emojis and trending hashtags to put across their messages by stealth. He offered example tweets like: 'Hearing cool stuff about Sharia law. I'ma check it out. Then there's an emoji of a ghost with an eye patch.' He also suggested: 'Loving this new show ""Selfie"" on ABC. P.S. can you believe Israel is still a state?' and 'We will destroy the infidels #thankyoujeter' Scary: Saturday Night Live later moved on to parodying the Ebola crisis - with a mock-up movie trailer for a sequel to The Fault In Our Stars . Health scares: The fake trailer made light of the disease ravaging West Africa . The mock-Obama also made jokes about the CIA finding profiles on Tinder marked DTJ - Down to Jihad - a play on a popular dating acronym on the network. When asked why the agents were on the app in the first place he simply said: 'That's not important' The interview was cut short when a Secret Service agent blundered onstage telling Obama he had an urgent meeting with 'a man with a sharpened screwdriver'. Saturday Night Live later moves on to a mock movie trailer - a sequel to The Fault in Our Stars in which the love interest, played by host Sarah Silverman - has the deadly virus. She is shown falling for a leading man - who reciprocates but always stays at least 5ft away from her - or wears hazmat gear. Her suggestion that they 'take a plane somewhere' is not rapturously received. 'Maybe we should take a plane'? The trailer, starring host Sarah Silverman, deployed trademark risqué humor .","Jay Pharaoh - posing as the President - praises jihadists' hashtag skills .

"Dressed in drab red jumpers, two children climb to the top of a rubbish heap a dozen times taller than them. The shocking scene is typical of Buenos Aires' Matanza-Riachuelo river basin, one of the ten most polluted places in the world. A list of ten filthy sites, from Russia to Indonesia to Ghana, has been amassed by the global environmental group The Blacksmith Institute - which says 200 million people are endangered daily in the top ten places alone. 1: Matanza-Riachuelo River Basin, Buenos Aires. It is just 37 miles long but its banks are packed with 15,000 industries spewing chemicals like zinc, lead, copper, nickel and chromium into the filthy water . Filthy: Some parts of the river basin look normal, but 60% of its homes are deemed unfit for human habitation. Residents suffer diarrhoea, breathing difficulties and cancer as there are few sources of safe drinking water . Some governments are working to make life better but in others, the damage has already been done. On the list is the former Soviet nuclear plant Chernobyl, which suffered a massive meltdown in 1986 in what is widely known as the worst nuclear disaster in history. Others, though, few people have heard of. Deep in the wastes of Siberia is the industrial city of Norislk. Founded by Stalin in 1935 to provide forced labour for the gulags, it was for decades the largest heavy metals mine in the world. It has leaked millions of tons of copper oxide, nickel oxide and sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, causing lung diseases and cancers of the digestive tract. The report - which says six of the sites are new to the list since it was last compiled in 2006 - said symptoms of people suffering from pollution include organ damage, diahrroea, eye damage, vomiting, lung diseases, cancers and premature birth. 2: Norilsk, Siberia. Once the largest heavy metals smelting complex in the world, Stalin built it and forced gulag prisoners to work there. Life expectancy for factory workers is 10 years below the Russian average . Smog: High levels of copper and nickel have been found in the soil 'nearly everywhere' within 40 miles of Norilsk, Russia, where 130,000 people live. Children get sick one and a half times more often than those nearby . Ominous: Norilsk, Russia, pictured in 1993. Two million tons of sulphur dioxide pour into the air every year . The lack of good medical care in poorer countries means they are particularly vulnerable - explaining, in part, why many of the worst places are in what was traditionally called the Third World. The report said: 'The shortage of adequate resources in many low-and middle-income countries increases the severity of health impacts from toxic pollution while simultaneously marginalizing those who need help the most. 'An objective of the work of Blacksmith Institute and Green Cross Switzerland and one goal of this report is to enhance understanding and funding for this crucial area of public health.' 3: Citarum River Basin, Indonesia. Some nine million people live along its banks and it provides 80% of Jakarta's drinking water - but scientists have found lead at more than 1,000 times the recommended level . Horrifying: But the report said the Indonesian government is trying to solve the river's huge health risks . The most densely-populated area, Indonesia's Citarum River Basin, is home to some nine million people but also countless factories and industrial sites. Despite providing 80% of Jakarta's drinking water it has lead at more than 1,000 times the recommended level and manganese at four times the recommended level. Meanwhile Hazaribagh in Bangladesh has a more unexpected source of pollution - it is teeming with almost 300 tanneries to make leather. Toxic world: Eight of the ten most polluted places named in a report by the Blacksmith Institute . 4: Kabwe, Zambia's second-biggest city, once held one of the world's largest lead mines. Children have up to ten times the recommended level of lead in their blood. The government did not tackle the problem for 90 years . The process of making leather uses dangerous amounts of the chemical hexavalent chromium, which was made famous as a water pollutant in the Hollywood film Erin Brockovich. The chemical causes cancer and is almost universally banned throughout Europe, but it is among the 22,000 cubic litres of toxic waste dumped into Hazaribagh's water supply every day. Tannery workers' homes are built next to contaminated streams, ponds and canals and they suffer horrifying symptoms including skin rashes, acid burns, dizziness and nausea. 5: Hazaribagh, Bangladesh, is home to 270 tanneries for making leather - which together dump 22,000 cubic litres of toxic waste every day including the cancer-causing chemical hexavalent chromium . Dangerous: Hexavalent chromium was made famous by the film Erin Brockovich, which documented the story of an American junior lawyer and single mother who campaigned to expose water pollution . In Kalimantan, Indonesia, a long history of gold mining is to blame. The process uses large quantities of the toxic chemical mercury - causing decades of health problems for its residents. The Western world has a big part to play in the levels of pollution in these countries, the report said. Dr Jack Caravanos, assistant director of research at the Blacksmith Institute, told the Earth Island Journal: '[In the United States,] your whole body is covered with products whose fundamental chemical ingredients have likely come from other countries. The contamination stayed in those countries.' 6: Kalimantan, Indonesia, is a world centre of gold mining - which uses the dangerous chemical mercury and releases 1,000 tons of it a year. Pictured: A coal mine in East Kalimantan province . People in Kalimantan eat fish containing up to double the recommended levels of mercury . 7: Pripyat, Ukraine, played host to the massive meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986. It is deserted, a ghost town which has become an eerie haunt only for investigators and photographers of its crumbling homes . Toxic: The Chernobyl nuclear reactor 26 years after the meltdown which killed thousands. It is now cased in concrete, but there are still dangerous levels of radioactive particles in the soil for miles around . The report said several governments, especially in Indonesia, are doing their best to tackle the problems. Others have been taken off the 'worst ten' list since 2006, including sites in Peru, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, India and Azerbaijan. But the report admits there will inevitably be pollution scandals waiting to be uncovered. It said: 'These listings, as explicitly acknowledged in the reports, were based on limited information and data. 'This was only to be expected, since pollution by its nature shuns the spotlight.' To find out more visit worstpolluted.org. 8: The Niger River Delta, Nigeria, is home to some of the world's biggest petrochemical plants and saw almost 7,000 spills from 1976 to 2001 where the oil was never recovered. A quarter of children are starving . Toxic: The Niger delta is also home to crime - pictured is a boat which was burned by authorities after being loaded with stolen oil. An average of 240,000 barrels of crude oil are spilt every year in the area . 9: Dzershinsk, Russia, a Soviet industrial city where 300,000 tons of chemical waste were put into unsafe forms of landfill - many of them seeping into groundwater. Three of the worst ten are in former Soviet states . Entry prohibited! A sign warns people away from the Sibur-Neftekhim sludge reservoir near Dzershinsk . 10: The Agbogbloshie Dumpsite in Accra, Ghana, is where many western computers end up without the resources to process them properly.

"Thousands of new mothers are being let down by inadequate GP appointments that are supposed to ensure they recover well from labour, a study has found. Nearly half said their six-week post-natal check was not thorough enough, with one in five saying it lasted less than five minutes. Almost a third (29 per cent) claimed their GP did not ask about their state of mind, even though doctors are meant to check for post-natal depression. Scroll down for video . Nearly half of new mums said their six-week post-natal check was not thorough enough, with one in five saying it lasted less than five minutes . A fifth claimed they 'put on a brave face', too embarrassed to admit that they were struggling with motherhood. The consultations are offered on the NHS six weeks after labour to check that women are recovering physically and emotionally, and coping with caring for their babies. GPs are meant to weigh women, check their blood pressure, test their urine for kidney infections and ask a series of questions about their wellbeing. But a survey of 4,000 new mothers by the National Childbirth Trust found 45 per cent thought the checks were substandard. Another 43 per cent said their GP did not understand their circumstances and 7 per cent wanted to talk about how they were coping emotionally but ran out of time. GPs are meant to weigh women, check their blood pressure, test their urine for kidney infections and ask a series of questions about their wellbeing . One mother, Lyssie, from Leeds, said her GP was abrasive and made her feel a nuisance, adding: 'As a first-time mum I felt rushed and as if I was a nuisance. I felt as if I couldn't possibly ask, 'Is this normal?'. 'I had some questions but I didn't feel comfortable to ask them due to the GP's manner.' Another, Allie, from London, said: 'There was no consideration of the difficult labour I had gone through and impact it may have had on me psychologically.' NCT chief executive Belinda Phipps said: 'The check-up is a key opportunity to spot potential problems. Post-natal depression can develop from this stage, as well as other physical and psychological disorders. 'So it is worrying that almost a third of women were not even asked about how they felt. Identification early on is crucial.' Common problems that should be picked up include difficulty in shedding pregnancy weight, or going too far the other way and developing eating disorders as mums try to regain their figure. The checks are also an invaluable opportunity for mothers to admit they are struggling with breastfeeding, or seek advice on how to settle their baby. Cathy Ranson, editor in chief of the website Netmums, said: 'The check is a vital safety net, but this system isn't working. Investing a little more time and money could pick up serious emotional and psychological issues much earlier, saving the NHS millions in treatment costs later.'

"An orphaned kitten thinks she is a dog after being brought up by an Irish Wolfhound. Roomba, a tiny 13 week-old stray, was found abandoned in a ditch when she was just three days old after her mother was run over and killed by a car. She was taken in by Annie Georgeson, of Dibden, near Southampton, Hampshire, and the first thing she saw when she opened her eyes was Aoife the wolfhound. Little Roomba thinks she is a dog after being brought up by Aoife the Irish Wolfhound (both pictured) - and the pair love nothing more than to play, snuggle up and groom one another . When Roomba first opened her eyes she saw Aoife - which may be another reason she thinks she is a dog . Roomba, named after a brand of automatic vacuum cleaner which changes direction when it hits a wall, now follows Aoife everywhere and loves snuggling up to her surrogate mother. Retired Ms Georgeson says little Roomba, who has sight problems, quickly became firm friends with her two wolfhounds, six year old Aiofe and male Ohno, three. She said: 'She does all sorts of funny things like crawl in between the wolfhounds and you will just see a bit of cat poking out.' Roomba also rolls over with the dogs when they do and loves being with them. Irish Wolfhound Aoife 'usually wants to eat cats' but has taken an 'extraordinary' liking to kitten Roomba . Annie Georgeson (pictured with Roomba) fostered the kitten after she was found abandoned in a ditch . Roomba runs to the door to greet people, eats  out of the dog's bowl and even rolls over when Aoife rolls over . Roomba's vulnerability appears to have awoken Aoife's maternal instincts and the pair are now inseparable . Sarah Mills, manager at All Animal Rescue, which first took Roomba in when she was found, said: 'It's a very, very unusual situation. 'Annie fosters animals for us and Aiofe usually wants to eat cats, but she's taken an extraordinary liking to Roomba. 'Even Ohno will put up with anything from Roomba. 'It seems like her vulnerability has brought out an amazing maternal instinct in the dogs and they treat her like own of their own. 'Aiofe grooms Roomba and cleans her and Roomba does the same back to Aiofe. Roomba, who has sight problems, is in need of a permanent home - and she absolutely loves dogs . 'Now Roomba is becoming more and more dog like. She runs to the door to greet people with the dogs, she eats the same food at the same time out of the same bowl and she follows the same routine. 'The first thing she saw when she opened her eyes was this Irish wolfhound so I guess she thinks she's a dog. She loves being around them.' Miss Milles, 31, added: 'By rights she should have died but she's a fighter and obviously thought ""I will beat this."" 'She's a little trooper and has fought tooth and nail to survive. 'She's a superstar and just loves the dogs.' Roomba is looking for a permanent home and, although she loves dogs, is scared of children, probably due to her vision problems. She would need a quiet and calm home to live in. The other two cats from the same litter as her have already been homed.","Roomba was just three days old when she was found abandoned in a ditch .

"Earlier this week Taylor Swift removed her entire back catalog from music streaming service Spotify, and now the singer has explained why. The decision came at the same time she was promoting new album 1989, which sold 1.287 copies in its first week, just shy of Britney Spears' record for the biggest-ever album weekly sales by a female artist (1.319million). 'If I had streamed the new album, it’s impossible to try to speculate what would have happened,' Taylor told Yahoo of leaving Spotify. Scroll down for video . Explanation: Taylor Swift, pictured on Tuesday in Tokyo, has revealed that she removed all of her music from Spotify because she doesn't want to contribute her 'life's work to an experiment' 'But all I can say is that music is changing so quickly, and the landscape of the music industry itself is changing so quickly, that everything new, like Spotify, all feels to me a bit like a grand experiment. And I’m not willing to contribute my life’s work to an experiment that I don’t feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music.' The 24-year-old added: 'And I just don’t agree with perpetuating the perception that music has no value and should be free.' Taylor referenced the piece she wrote for the Wall Street Journal in July in which she expressed that she does not believe music should be free, and in her interview with Yahoo went on: 'I try to stay really open-minded about things, because I do think it’s important to be a part of progress. 'But I think it’s really still up for debate whether this is actual progress, or whether this is taking the word “music” out of the music industry.' Taylor's current single Shake It Off was among the songs she removed, and had been the most streamed track on the service in the U.S., the U.K. and globally. And she explained she was keen on giving the service a try, but that it just didn't work out. Taylor told Yahoo: 'A lot of people were suggesting to me that I try putting new music on Spotify with Shake It Off, and so I was open-minded about it. Big decision: The singer, seen here performing on GMA last week removed her entire back catalog from the popular music-streaming service - just as her record label boss is attempting to sell his business . 'I thought, ""I will try this; I’ll see how it feels."" It didn’t feel right to me. I felt like I was saying to my fans, ""If you create music someday, if you create a painting someday, someone can just walk into a museum, take it off the wall, rip off a corner off it, and it’s theirs now and they don’t have to pay for it."" Taylor added: 'I didn’t like the perception that it was putting forth. And so I decided to change the way I was doing things.' In a statement posted on Spotify’s website after her music was removed, the company said it was trying to get the hit-maker to change her mind. ‘We love Taylor Swift, and our more than 40 million users love her even more – nearly 16 million of them have played her songs in the last 30 days, and she’s on over 19 million playlists. ‘We hope she’ll change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone. 'We believe fans should be able to listen to music wherever and whenever they want, and that artists have an absolute right to be paid for their work and protected from piracy. That’s why we pay nearly 70 percent of our revenue back to the music community.' Smash hit success: The decision came at the same time she was promoting new album 1989, which sold 1.287 copies in its first week, just shy of Britney Spears' record for the biggest-ever album weekly sales by a female artist (1.319million) It has been suggested the decision may have been instigated by Taylor's record label, reports Billboard. Big Machine Label Group is up for sale and a source said the decision to leave Spotify was aimed at driving up the sales price. 'Big Machine is in the process of selling itself, and that can't be forgotten here. [They're looking to] increase the multiple for the sale of that company. [Owner] Scott Borchetta is a very old-school thinker. He's wrong,' said the source. It isn't unusual for major artists to wait a while before releasing new material to the streaming service - Coldplay, The Black Keys and Beyoncé have all withheld their latest albums in a bid to encourage greater first week physical sales. Taylor's last album, Red, didn't make it onto Spotify until eight months after it was first launched. More unusual is the singer's decision to remove her back catalog from the service, while her older albums currently remain available on rival Beats Music, which is owned by Apple. Pulling out all the stops: The 24-year-old singer underwent a promotional frenzy last week to promote the release of her fifth album - including this appearance on The Talk . In the past Spotify has drawn criticism from some artists who claim it doesn't pay them enough in royalties. Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke withdrew his project Atoms for Peace from Spotify in 2013 and launched an angry Twitter tirade over its royalty rates. 'Make no mistake new artists you discover on #Spotify will no get paid,' he posted. 'Meanwhile shareholders will shortly being rolling in it. Simples.' According to the latest Spotify figures, the service has 10 million paying customers and 30 million free users. The Seven-time GRAMMY winner recently announced The 1989 World Tour on Good Morning America, which will kick off on 20 May, 2015 in Louisiana, USA. The 1989 World Tour will encompass eight countries and span four continents including North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. Please come back: Spotify announced on Monday that Swift had pulled her entire back catalog from the service and posted a playlist of songs as a plea to the singer to return .","The 24-year-old singer removed all her songs from the music-streaming service, including current single Shake It Off .

"A woman who spent a decade trying every diet under the sun has undergone a body transformation in just 12 weeks. Lisa O'Daly, 33, from South East London, struggled with her shape since her early 20s and has never managed to shift excess weight, especially around her middle. After giving everything from Weight Watchers to the Dukan diet a go over the last 10 years, she finally got the toned, taut body she dreamed of after discovering weightlifting, and pairing it with a healthy diet. Scroll down for video . Lisa's body fat percentage went from 24 per cent to 19 per cent, and she lost 2.3kgs in just 12 weeks . While her weight only dropped 5lbs from 9st 12lbs to 9st 7lbs, her size changed dramatically. The former size 14 can now fit into size 8 clothes, and her body fat percentage has dropped from 24 to 19 per cent, showing off her toned muscles. Lisa said: 'I've tried every diet you can think of but nothing really stuck. At first, it was bizarre muscling my way into the weights room at the gym.' Lisa had spent every year since she finished university trying two or three diets a year. Her eating plans included the Zone diet, the 5:2 diet, weight watchers, Carol Vorderman's 21 day detox, No carbs after 5pm, Low carb evenings, the Ducan diet, and juice fasting. But Lisa yo-yoed and couldn't keep the weight off, ranging between a size 8 and 16 over 10 years. As soon as she was under stress she would turn to doughnuts, chocolate and coffee and would skip the gym when her job in HR got busy. She embarked on the USN fitness programme that combines healthy eating with intense weight training . All her eating and exercise habits have changed and she's clued up on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle . When her friend Tarryn suggested she try the Ultimate Sports Nutrition programme Lisa never thought she would find herself at home with bench pressing in the weights section. But in just 12 weeks of the fitness programme that combines healthy eating with intense weight training she lost 2.3kg and developed a six pack. The free body transformation challenge is based around a five day programme with two rest days, booked online, but the optional USN supplements and shake powders are paid for, available through their website. Thanks to switching snacking on Ben and Jerry's and Dairy Milk to lean meat, veg and brown rice Lisa sent her body fat from 24 per cent down to 19 per cent. She followed a plan of daily exercise to tone her abs, arms and legs and tried out protein supplements to help kick-start her complete makeover which saw her go from a size 14 to a size 8. Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Three courses of soup with bread, cheesy pasta, and a cake for desert . Dinner: Large spaghetti bolognese . Snack: Lots of full-fat milk coffees, doughnuts . Pre and post-workout whey protein shake . Breakfast: Porridge . Lunch: Salad with grilled chicken, brown rice . Dinner: Fish with steamed vegetables . Snacks: Handful of nuts . Pre-workout USN supplements: Xedra Cut Slim Pack and CLA Thermo . She took protein supplements to help her complete makeover which saw her go from a size 14 to a size 8 . Day 1 – Legs and abs (squats, lunges, free weights) Day 2 – Chest and triceps (flat bench dumbbell presses and overhead chest extensions) Day 3 – Shoulders (overhead presses and raises) Day 4 – Back and biceps (barbell rows, dead lifts and curls) Day 5 – Circuit with plank and crunches . Lisa followed the USN programme pretty closely, working out for 45 minutes a day throughout the 12 weeks, for five days a week with two days off. She gradually increased the weights as she got further through the programme. Week 1 - arm curling 2kg, leg press 65kg . Week 12 - arm curling 8kg, leg press 200kg . Lisa said: 'I'd started loads of diets, and sometimes finished them, but it never worked. I'd fall back into my old eating habits and put it all back on. 'I thought I was eating healthily and even went to spin classes at the gym but I still had rolls around my stomach. I assumed food was good for me just because it says low carb and low fat on the label. I assumed it was good for me. 'I wasn't obese or and people didn't look at me and think I was fat, but I wasn't happy and I knew that I needed to lose a few pounds. When I hit 11 and a half stone I became officially classed as overweight and that shocked me into action. But I wanted to do something that was maintainable which USN is. 'The weight came off really quickly and after just six weeks people were noticing that I'd changed. 'But it's stayed off too. All my eating and exercise habits have changed and I've clued up on healthy eating.'","Lisa O'Daly, 33, from South East London, yo-yoed from size 8-16 .

"Superstar NRL fullback Greg Inglis has sunk the hearts of Sydney Roosters supporters by leading the Hollywood-owned South Sydney Rabbitohs into their first rugby league grand final in 43 years. The Rabbitohs' number one  tore the Roosters apart in the 32-22 win, scoring twice to end NRL veteran and Roosters' captain Anthony Minichiello's 14-year career in the game. The highly anticipated semi-final at Homebush, Sydney, was watched by South Sydney owner Russell Crowe who walked onto the ground after the match to embrace his players in an emotionally-charged Sydney derby. The match, played in front of 52,592 fans, will see Souths play in their first grand final since 1971 and sets the tone for a mouth-watering weekend of sport across the nation as the Sydney Swans and Hawthorn Hawks battle it out in Saturday's AFL grand final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It is expected a crowd of 100,000 fans will front the MCG to watch the most celebrated day of sport for the code.

Roosters captain Anthony Minichiello looked destined for a fairy tale finish  when he scored early to take the Roosters to a 12 point lead. Scoring off a James Maloney kick, Minichiello and the Roosters looked ominous early but couldn't deliver the knock-out punch as the Rabbitohs stormed back into the match scoring 30 unanswered points to steer themselves into next week's NRL grand final. It also ends Sonny Bill Williams' return to the NRL with the 2013 premiership winner heading to New Zealand rugby next season to play for his old club, The Chiefs. South Sydney will either play either meet the Canterbury Bulldogs or Penrith Panthers in  next Sunday's decider at ANZ stadium. Russell Crowe's men took the game away from the Roosters in front of a healthy crowd of 52,592 people. The Friday night blockbuster was the perfect prelude to a weekend of  footy finals across Australia with tomorrow's AFL grand final set to draw a crowd double that size. The dramatic night of sport unfolded before a ball was even kicked when heavily guarded police officers patrolled train stations and outside the ground. The extra security was in response to the  heightened terror alert in the wake of recent events across the country. Both sides went in to the half-time break equal before the Rabbitoh's shot clear to win by 10 points.

The pivotal moment inside the Rabbitoh's huddle before they took the match away from the Sydney Roosters . Greg Inglis proved to strong in the match scoring in the 52nd minute to sink Roosters' supporters hearts around the country . Like Lance Buddy Franklin for the Sydney Swans, Burgess has been one of the Rabbitohs' highest paid recruits since coming to the club in 2013. Before the season started he announced a return to the English Super League but committed himself to finishing on a high at South Sydney by putting himself on a self-imposed media ban. He has since broken that ban and after the match spoke with Channel Nine reporter Andrew Johns about the most important achievement on his mind this year - winning a grand final. 'It was a good performance, we went down 12 early but we stuck in there and didn't panic.' 'We have worked for this all year. It's been in my mind and the only thing I have thought about, it's good to finally get there but we've not achieved anything just yet.' 'I have made some great friends (at South Sydney) i'm just going to enjoy the next nine, 10 days, and then maybe the next couple of days after that. 'It's been a cracking journey.' South Sydney coach Michael Macguire spoke candidly about this team's incredibly tough performance. 'I'm just really proud of my players,' he said. 'The smiles on their face mate, it's unreal.' Although recent history would have fans believe otherwise, South Sydney are the most successful rugby league side in the game having won 20 premierships. It has been 43 years since they last appeared in and won a grand final which was way back in 1971 against the St George Dragons.

"A 20-year-old pizza deliveryman from Florida was arrested and charged with murder after police say he strangled and stabbed to death his roommate, and then had sex with her lifeless body. Bryan Santana, of Orlando, was taken into custody at a barbershop Tuesday. When questioned by police, he allegedly confessed to killing 23-year-old Shelby Fazio by choking her from behind and stabbing her in the neck. 'He stated that he later had sexual intercourse with her body after she was dead,' according to his arrest report. Scroll down for video . Savage act: Bryan Santana, 20 (left), has been charged with murder for allegedly killing 23-year-old Shelby Fazio (right) and then desecrating her body . Mayhem: Police found Fazio's body with ligature marks around her neck and her corpse covered in stab wounds inside this house on North John Street in Orlando . Gory sight: Fazio's other roommate, John Heermance, returned home and found a trail of blood leading to the woman's bedroom . Evidence: Investigators retrieved what appeared to be a blood-spattered shirt from a trash can outside the house . Writing on the wall: A piece of drywall was removed from the home with the words: ‘Not sorry for what I did’ and ‘I’m sorry' The 20-year-old also allegedly attempted to kill his other roommate and planned to buy a fake gun so he could commit 'suicide by cop.' The grisly incident took place early Tuesday morning inside the house at 447 North John Street, which Bryan Santana shared with Fazio and 23-year-old John Heermance who moved in three months ago. Heermance told investigators that he came home at around 9am Tuesday and noticed a trail of blood smeared across the hallway leading to Shelby Fazio's room, which was closed. The arrest affidavit cited by Orlando Sentinel stated that Heermance then saw Santana in the bathroom washing his hands. The 23-year-old man hurried to his room to grab his cellphone and car keys so he could call for help from a safe distance, but in that moment Santana allegedly pounced on him armed with a can of pepper spray and a knife. Heermance was able to fight off his roommate and flee the house unharmed. Santana told police that with Heermance gone, he jumped into Shelby Fazio’s car and headed to a Walmart store.

Companion: Fazio shared the house in Orlando with two male roommates and her dog (pictured) ‘He said he was looking for a Walmart to find a fake gun like a BB gun so he could point it at a police officer so they would shoot him,’ the report said. But before the 20-year-old man had a chance to carry out his plan, he was arrested by police acting on a tip inside a barbershop in downtown Orlando and hauled off to the Orange County Jail. The owner of the hair salon told Channel 9 that Santana went in to get a haircut and was in a rush, telling the barber that he was going to the movies with a 'hot girl.' ‘His eyes were big and [he] said, “I'm going to jail,” so he knew it was over,’ the shop owner said, describing the moment of Santana’s arrest. Officers who arrived at the trio's residence found Shelby Fazio dead with ligature marks around her neck and stab wounds on her body.

"Profits at controversial payday lender Wonga more than halved last year as the company embarked on a drive to clean up the image of the business, it was revealed today. Wonga said the 53 per cent slide in profits to £39.7million in 2013 was in part due to a one-off charge in relation to a recent scandal over fake legal letters. These were used in order to chase struggling customers into paying up, and Wonga racked up £18.8million in costs relating to the scandal. The company said it expects that it will be ‘smaller and less profitable’ in the near term while it builds a more sustainable business for the future. Scroll down for video . Pay-day lender: Wonga said it expects that it will be ‘smaller and less profitable in the near term’ The firm, which has been attacked by MPs for charging interest rates of over 5,000 per cent, had been forecast to post annual profits of £50million for 2013 compared with £84.5 million in 2012. But the slump revealed today was even worse than expected, and is reported to have also come from difficulties at its overseas and small business operations. Wonga issued 4.6 million loans in 2013, a rise of 15 per cent, and lent a total of £1.3billion, compared with £1.19billion the previous year. Revenues were 2 per cent higher at £314.7million but operating costs jumped 56 per cent to £133.7million. The default rate on loans fell to 7 per cent from 7.4 per cent in 2012. New strategy: Wonga put an end to its puppet adverts to prevent young people being lured into debt . Michael Ruck, a senior financial services enforcement lawyer at Pinsent Masons and formerly with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said: ‘Such a large drop in profits reflects both the impact of FCA regulation and also the current reputation of payday lenders. ‘Firms are in the process of finding out if they have achieved FCA authorisation. Despite the large amount of time and money invested by firms, they need to understand the standards and approach of the FCA including how to challenge the FCA. ‘Wonga and similar firms need to stop shooting themselves in the foot by doing things such as allegedly impersonating solicitors to recover monies from customers.’ In July it brought in the former chief executive of the RSA insurance group, Andy Haste, to head the group, replacing founder Errol Damelin who left earlier in the year, in a bid to clean up its battered reputation. At the time of his appointment Mr Haste said: ‘This is a sector and Wonga is a company that needs to go through significant change if it is to have a sustainable future. Compared: While Wonga's revenues were up by £5million, their costs also increased by almost £50million . Dejected: Wonga sponsors Newcastle United FC, whose players are seen after losing at Stoke City last night . ‘Some serious mistakes have been made. The company admitted those mistakes and it has apologised for those mistakes.’ Only a fifth of people struggling to repay a loan had the interest frozen and just a quarter thought the lender treated them sympathetically, a poll claimed today. The figures from a Citizens Advice survey carried out between April and August this year also showed just one in three people thought the costs of extending a loan were made clear. Meanwhile one in five were told of the availability of free debt advice, and half of customers said payday lenders asked them questions about their personal finances. Gillian Guy, chief executive of CA, said: ‘Payday lenders are still not sticking to their word to treat people fairly.’ Separate analysis of CA clients with serious debt problems also found one in eight had a payday loan, and that £1,000 was the average payday loan debt. In June Wonga was fined £2.6million for sending threatening legal letters from fake law firms to 45,000 customers by City watchdog The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA said Wonga had been guilty of ‘unfair and misleading debt collection practices’ by creating fake companies to pressure struggling customers into paying their bills. Pay lenders have been attacked by MPs as a form of ‘legal loan sharking’. In July the Church of England ended its indirect investment in Wonga - a holding that embarrassed the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who said he wanted to compete Wonga out of existence by boosting the use of credit unions. The FCA is also bearing down on providers of short-term credit, proposing earlier in the summer a cap on payday lending meaning that from next January, interest and fees must not exceed 0.8 per cent per day of the amount borrowed. It also wants to impose a cap on the overall cost of a payday loan so that it cannot exceed 100 per cent of the original sum borrowed. Earlier this month in a bid to beef up the personnel at the payday lender Mr Haste brought in Tara Kneafsey as managing director of its UK consumer loans business. Ms Kneafsey had previously spent six years at insurer RSA. In recent years payday loan firms - which have been attacked by MPs as a form of 'legal loan sharking’ - have been in the spotlight for crippling interest rates. Wonga, for instance, charges 5,853 per cent in annual interest. For a £100 loan over 30 days, meanwhile, it charges £37.15. The Archbishop of Canterbury, MPs and debt campaigners have joined the growing clamour of critics that has left such short-term lenders branded ‘legal loan sharks’. Justin Welby: In July the Church of England's investment arm severed ties with Wonga, after criticism by the Archbishop of Canterbury (pictured) of the payday lending industry . In July the Church of England's investment arm severed ties with Wonga, after the Archbishop of Canterbury's criticism of the payday lending industry. Wonga's reputation was further damaged this summer by a fake legal letter scandal. It was revealed that the firm had been chasing struggling customers with letters from made-up legal firms to pressurise them into paying up. Between October 2008 and November 2010, the firm sent correspondence to about 45,000 customers in arrears from non-existent law firms threatening legal action. Annual results: Wonga's pre-tax profits were down by 53 per cent to £39.7million in 2013, compared to 2012 . The case, which consumer campaigners described as a 'shocking new low' for the payday industry, also saw Wonga add charges to some customers' accounts to cover administration fees for sending the letters, from fictitious firms Chainey, D'Amato & Shannon and Barker and Lowe Legal Recoveries. Wonga boss: In July it brought in the former chief executive of the RSA insurance group, Andy Haste (pictured), to head the group . The Financial Conduct Authority announced that Wonga is to pay £2.6million in compensation to the customers affected. Part of new chairman Andy Haste’s strategy for cleaning up the firm's image was the ditching of puppets in its TV adverts and marketing to limit the risk of making its payday loans appeal to the young. Adverts for its loans featured a group of supposedly cool and trendy pensioners Betty, Joyce and Earl in amusing situations. But debt campaigners said the tactic made high-cost loans seem fun and normal to young people and children. Debt charity StepChange recently said that the number of people struggling to cope with payday loan debts has risen by more than 13,000 in the past year. It said they dealt with 43,716 people in the first six months of this year, compared with 30,762 for the same period last year. Some people have become burdened with so much debt from payday loan firms that it has driven them to suicide. An inquest in July heard that Ian Jordan from Botley, near Southampton, was driven to kill himself after racking up debts of more than £20,000 with at least nine payday loans companies — one of which was charging him 5,000 per cent interest. Loans: Wonga's reputation was further damaged this summer by a fake legal letter scandal . In July the FCA announced proposals to introduce a cap on the fees and interest charged by payday lending firms in a bid to protect borrowers from escalating debts. The proposals, which include default fees capped at £15 and a limit of 0.8 per cent per day on interest on unpaid balances, should mean those who cannot repay on time will never have to pay back more in charges than the amount borrowed. The latest clampdown on the industry by the FCA is due to come into force in January, subject to a consultation period.","Controversial lender expects to be 'smaller and less profitable in near term'

"Shamed designer John Galliano, who was sacked by Dior in 2011 for a series of racist and anti-Semitic offences, has been hired as creative director of Belgian brand Maison Martin Margiel. The British designer, 53, was asked to leave his job after a damning video emerged of him telling a woman whom he thought was Jewish that he 'loves Hitler' and that her parents should have been 'gassed'. He then allegedly ranted to an Asian man sitting with her: '****ing Asian b******, I'm going to kill you.' Two other women also complained to police about suffering anti-Semitic abuse at the hands of the designer. Scroll down for video . Left: Shamed fashion designer John Galliano sporting a clean look to publicise his new appointment; Right: Arriving at court in 2011 following a video which emerged of him spewing anti-Semitic and racist abuse . Showing his soft side: Fashion designer John Galliano gives a finger to the camera . Face of Dior, Natalie Portman, was amongst those outraged by his remarks. At the time the Oscar-winning actress said: 'In light of this video, and as an individual who is proud to be Jewish, I will not be associated with Mr Galliano in any way. 'I hope at the very least these terrible comments remind us to reflect and act upon combating these still-existing prejudices that are the opposite of all that is beautiful.' Dior owners LVMH cited a zero-tolerance policy on racism and anti-Semitism and immediately gave the designer his marching orders. He was later charged in court and given a suspended sentence. Since then, Galliano has undergone treatment for drugs and alcohol and worked briefly as a designer for New York fashion brand Oscar de la Renta in 2013. A graduate of London's prestigious Central Saint Martin's College, Galliano was famous for his theatrical, romantic shows at Dior as well as for his creative designs for his John Galliano brand, which is still owned and run by LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group. Left: Former Dior fashion designer John Galliano on the catwalk; Right: Face of Dior actress Natalie Portman was amongst those who found his comments deeply offensive . But Renzo Rosso, president of Only the Brave group, which owns Maison Martin Margiel as well as jeans brand Diesel, Marni and Viktor & Rolf, would prefer not to dwell on the past. He said in a statement: 'This appointment marks a new era in the history of the Maison.' He also described Galliano as a 'a visionary and non-conformist'. The brand's founder Martin Margiela left his fashion house in 2009. Before that he kept a very low profile, rarely giving interviews. When he did, he preferred to do so in writing, and he would generally sign Maison Martin Margiela as opposed to his own name. His brand's products did not carry the Belgian fashion house's name, but visible white stitches instead as a signature. 'They hired the most visible designer to replace the most invisible designer, which is very ironic and funny and from that point of view, very much in the spirit of Maison Martin Margiela,' said Bea Ercolini, editor-in-chief at the Belgian edition of fashion magazine, Elle. Since Margiela left, the brand has been led by a team of designers. Galliano's first show for the brand will be in January for Haute Couture week in Paris. OTB acquired Maison Martin Margiela in 2002 and the brand, which now makes around 100 million euros in annual sales, has been profitable for just under three years. In 2013, OTB made total revenues of 1.6 billion euros.","British designer's first appointment since he was found guilty of anti-Semitic abuse .

"David Cameron refused yesterday to rule out a deal with Ukip after next year’s general election, saying he wouldn’t speculate on what would happen if the Conservatives fail to win a majority again. The Prime Minister dodged a question on whether he might turn to Nigel Farage, whose party hopes to win a number of Commons seats, to help prop up a minority Tory administration. But there are growing fears among senior civil servants that the general election could produce a dead heat between the main parties – with only a ‘rainbow’ coalition made up of several parties able to govern. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured with Kelly Tolhurst, the Tory candidate in Rochester, said he did not want to specualte about what he would do if the Tories 'fall short' in 2015 . Ukip leader Nigel Farage is to target 100 seats in next year's general election . Pollsters say the Conservatives and Labour could end with around 284 seats each, and the Lib Dems 30 or even fewer. That would mean neither main party could form a coalition capable of commanding an absolute Commons majority of 326 with the Lib Dems alone. They would also have to try to reach a deal with either the SNP - on course to steal at least a dozen Labour seats in Scotland, which would give them a total approaching 20 - Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists, or Ukip and the Greens, which could each pick up two or three seats. Such a Government would be inherently unstable and dependent on personal relationships between several different party leaders. Asked if he would do a deal with Mr Farage in order to stay in power, if Ukip does win its first seats at a general election, the Prime Minister told BBC Radio Kent: ‘The next election is absolutely wide open, and it could easily result, if people vote the right way, in a Conservative-only government. That’s what I’m campaigning for and nothing’s going to distract me between now and then. ‘Until that election is over, you won’t get me speculating on what would happen if I fall short. ‘People know with me that I will always try and do the right thing for Britain. At the last election, we didn’t have an overall majority, we fell short, and I thought the right thing to do was to give Britain strong and stable government to get the deficit down, turn the economy round, get the country back to work. Listen to the full interview on BBC Radio Kent here. Is this the face of Ukip's second MP? Mark Reckless is standing in the by-election in Rochester and Strood . ‘I believe at the next election I’ve got a very strong case to say you’ve seen what we’ve done in coalition, having to make some compromises, not being able to go ahead with all the things we wanted to do, now give us the chance to really deliver for the country, including on issues like immigration.’ Aides insisted Mr Cameron had not been signalling any shift in his thinking, and would have given the same answer about coalition or a looser arrangement with any other political party, including the Lib Dems. ‘He gave his standard response, which is that he is going all out for a Conservative majority and he is not going to speculate about what happens in any other scenario,’ said one. ‘You could equally say he didn’t rule out an alliance with any other party.’ Mr Farage has suggested he might support the Tories in the event of a hung Parliament under a so-called ‘confidence and supply arrangement’, which means a minor party agreeing to support Budgets and other key measures but stopping short of a full coalition. Asked the day after Ukip’s byelection victory in Clacton if he was prepared to join a full coalition, Mr Farage said: ‘I don’t honestly think that’s what has to be done, just because the Liberal Democrats did that. There are other ways. You can support a minority government by saying on motions of confidence or on key bills you would give them support. There are lots of ways of doing this.’ A small number of Tory MPs have called for local pacts with Ukip in order to prevent the Eurosceptic vote from being split next year, something ruled out by both Tory and UKIP HQs. Senior figures in Ukip have privately admitted they would rather see Ed Miliband in power after the election because they believe an ‘out’ vote in an EU referendum is more likely under him than Mr Cameron, who has promised to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels.","Fears among senior civil servants that general election could produce a dead heat between main parties .

"John Bercow was urged to sack his chief spin doctor tonight after she launched an astonishing political attack on the Conservatives, Labour and Ukip. Justine McGuinness, who is in charge of media relations for the Commons Speaker, described the three parties as a ‘collection of clowns’. In an extraordinary rant at the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow, she accused the Conservatives of trying to ‘buy the election’, and blasted Ukip’s ‘utterly perverted notion of patriotism’. Commons Speaker John Bercow is supposed to be politically neutral, but his spokesman Justine McGuinness today used a speech to the Lib Dem party conference to launch an attack on other rival parties . She also attacked Labour for trying to ‘steal the election’ by supporting a ‘biased’ electoral system. Miss McGuinness, a longtime Lib Dem activist, was speaking in a personal capacity. But her comments appeared to breach the longstanding convention that the Speaker’s office must remain neutral on party political matters. Tory MP Michael Fabricant  said the tirade called into question Mr Bercow’s judgment in hiring Miss McGuinness – and called on him to sack her. He said: ‘The Speaker has to be politically neutral and has to be seen to be so. How then can he employ someone as his official spokesman who has nailed her colours to the mast in a political rant against the Conservatives and Labour? ‘This calls into question yet again the judgment of John Bercow. If she is still employed by him this evening after this then she should no longer be so. It is essential for the integrity of Parliament that the neutrality of the Speaker’s office is maintained. Tory MP Michael Fabricant said Mr Bercow could not employ someone who was so overtly political . ‘We also need to hear from Mr Bercow whether he was aware that his spokesman was going to make such an overtly political spokesman. Tirades of this nature are simply not acceptable – either from the Speaker or his spokesman.’ Miss McGuinness, a former media adviser to Kate and Gerry McCann, did not respond to calls  and it is now known whether she cleared her comments in advance with Mr Bercow. She has been involved in Lib Dem politics for years and has previously stood for Parliament against Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin. She is employed by the Commons on a freelance basis for an undisclosed sum, and is not a civil servant. But the highly political nature of her comments is likely to raise concerns at Westminster. Addressing activists from the main podium, she said: ‘The next general election campaign will be a really ugly business. ‘The Tories will aim to buy the election with the millions of pounds donated to them by their hot money, hedge fund friends. ‘Labour will seek to steal the election, relying on an electoral system so biased in their favour that 35 per cent of the vote could deliver them 55 per cent of the seats. ‘Ukip will try and hijack the election, turning the whole event into an argument about Europe and immigration as Nigel Farage swans around suburbia selling himself as some sort of suburban, saloon bar Socrates. ‘And the one thing that will connect this collection of clowns will be a desperate determination to marginalise the Liberal Democrats, for what they all fear above all else is that once again the British people will put the balance of power into our hands. ‘The Lib Dems will offer this country a fair deal. Labour have their warped sense of the term equality, the Tories are welcome to their twisted notion of freedom, and Ukip are welcome to their utterly perverted notion of patriotism. Fairness is what we will stand for.’ The row is an unwelcome development for Mr Bercow, who is already embroiled in controversy over his bid to appoint Australian Carol Mills as the new Commons Clerk despite widespread concerns she is not qualified for the job.","Justine McGuinness used a speech at Lib Dem conference to attack rivals .

"A great grandmother has called in police after being plagued by anonymous letters criticising her appearance and calling her a 'council house hussy'. Margaret Kitching, 76, says the poison pen letters, one of which is typed and the others handwritten, started when she rejoined a pensioners' club in her home village of Ardsley, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire. The retired dinner lady called in police after receiving four letters taunting her about her appearance and calling on her to leave the Over-55s club which meets fortnightly at the Oaks Working Men's Club near her home. Great grandmother Margaret Kitching, 76, called in police after receiving anonymous letters criticising her . Devil symbol: The first letter arrived last November, when Mrs Kitching had let her club attendance lapse . Officers have taken fingerprints from the letters and have asked all members of the club, which Mrs Kitching has recently started attending again after lapsing for a while, for samples of their handwriting. The first letter, which was typed, arrived at the bungalow Mrs Kitching shares with husband Ken, 81, last November, the day after she had had an operation which meant she hadn't attended the club for a while. It read: 'We are all glad you have left the club.  You are a mouthy, vindictive council hussy.  You can take the hussy out of a council house but you cannot take the council house woman and make her a silk purse!!!' And the letter ended with a devil symbol. Determined not to let the anonymous bully win, Mrs Kitching, who has three children, three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren, started going to the club again.  There are 23 members, all of them women in their 60s and 70s, and they organise events and trips including bingo, day trips to the seaside, quizzes and guest speakers. This February a second letter arrived, this one handwritten.  It read: 'Some of us are not best pleased that you are back (55s), you always was bolshi [sic] and liked your own way even at school. 'You are like mutton dressed as lamb in your charity shop clothes.' In June a third letter, also handwritten, and riddled with spelling mistakes, arrived for Mrs Kitching. Calling her a 'harridan', it said: 'You are cheap as chips with your cheap jewellery.  Your hair looks as though it has been cut with a knife and fork.' Then a fourth, handwritten, letter arrived, purporting to be from someone else as it begins: 'Hi, it's my turn.' The Ardsley Over55s club meets fortnightly at the Working Men's Club not far from Mrs Kitching's bungalow . The letter goes on: 'You would be surprised at what we get to know about you' and continues by calling Mrs Kitching a 'selfish gobby b****' and telling her to 'keep away' from the club where she has served on the committee. One of the letters ended with three kisses, while others included personal comments about Mrs Kitching's husband and relatives. Mrs Kitching said: 'Some of the things in the letters are unbelievable - they are absolutely horrible and really upsetting. 'I think there is a jealous person behind all this, but it's caused me real heartache and sleepless nights, as well as stress. 'When I go out of my home I am always looking over my shoulder, wondering if the perpetrator is following me like a stalker.' She believes the sender of the letters is not a member of the club, but someone in the village, possibly a former member of the club or someone who knows one.' The former dinner lady has called in police and says she has her suspicions about who the culprit may be . 'They say things like no-one likes me, and talk about my buying things from charity shops. It is running me down. 'When I first got the letters I said I wasn't going to the club any more, but my friend said if I stopped going then this person had won. So I'm still going.' She said other people in the area unconnected with the over-55s club had received similar poison pen letters about four years ago. 'One neighbour came to read my letters and he said straight away it was the same handwriting as on the letters he received all that time ago.' One 79-year-old club member said: 'We just haven't a clue where these letters are coming from. 'I can't believe it is a member of our club. We sit and chat, have a game of dominoes or bingo and wile away a couple of hours. We also arrange outings - they are a nice set of ladies. 'I have seen the letters and they are quite nasty and very personal. It is obviously somebody that knows Margaret well who is very vindictive.' Mrs Kitching said: 'It is definitely somebody who knows me and my family really well. I have my suspicions but I can't prove anything. If I had anything to say to someone I would say it to their face. I can't understand it.' A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'We have received reports of a 76-year-old woman receiving distressing letters from an unknown person. Officers are continuing their inquiries.'","Margaret Kitching received the first letter, which was typed, in November .

"The TV licence fee could be scrapped and replaced with subscriptions in the biggest shake-up since the BBC was founded in 1922. Some members of the Cabinet are understood to believe the compulsory £145.50 annual charge for television ownership is increasingly outdated. Senior industry figures also believe a fundamental rethink is required in a multi-channel age with more and more viewers using computers and mobile phones to watch programmes on internet catch-up services. Last week Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told the Mail the licence fee could be cut, saying: '£145.50 is a lot of money for some people' The BBC’s royal charter, which sets out the corporation’s scope and remit, and funding arrangement – both ten-year agreements – is up for renewal at the end of 2016. The Government has already announced a review of whether non-payment of the licence fee should be decriminalised. Ministers say it cannot be right that 200,000 people a year end up in court accused of not buying a TV licence. They face fines of up to £1,000 and a criminal record, with more than 50 a year going to prison. One possibility is for new technology to be used to cut off BBC channels for those who have not paid. Decriminalising non-payment for a licence, supported by most of the Cabinet, would pave the way for more fundamental reform in the charter review, which will begin in earnest after the election. David Elstein, who was a member of a review panel set up by the BBC to assess the corporation’s future, strongly supported decriminalisation of the non-payment of licence fees . One possibility is a subscription model, whereby viewers who want BBC services purchase a ‘bundle’ of channels, or even individual programmes or series. Subscriptions could replace some or all of the compulsory licence fee – breaking the link between owning a TV set and the licence fee. An alternative model, being used in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, would see a payment for the national broadcaster simply rolled into household taxes. Like other areas of public spending it would be subject to cuts in times of austerity. Last week Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told the Mail the licence fee could be cut. ‘£145.50 is a lot of money for some people,’ he said. ‘It’s incumbent on all public bodies to be vigilant when spending other people’s money and the BBC is no exception to this.’ The Commons culture and media committee has launched an inquiry into the future of the BBC. John Whittingdale, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, told a party conference meeting this week it was ‘getting steadily harder to sustain the licence fee’. He described compulsory licences as deeply unfair on those who cannot afford to pay the fee and end up in jail. David Elstein, a former Sky and ITV television executive, who was a member of a review panel set up by the BBC to assess the corporation’s future, said earlier this year: ‘It is socially unjust that so many are fined and indeed go to prison for not paying the licence fee. ‘And it makes more sense too for the BBC to move to subscription from 2020, which is about the date when set-boxes go, and standard definition TV is phased out.’ You need a TV licence if you watch or record TV as it is being broadcast. This includes the use of devices such as a computer, mobile or DVD recorder. Under a subscription model, rival broadcasters such as ITV would be free. A BBC spokesman said: 'At 40p a day the Licence Fee is tremendous value and ensures that everyone gets access to great content that informs, educates and entertains. 'Support for the licence fee has risen by 22 per cent since 2004 and remains the most popular way of funding the BBC across all ages and socio-economic backgrounds.'","Experts believe rethink is required in multi-channel age with more viewers using computers and mobile phones to watch programmes .

"Residents told to boil drinking water for the second time in a week because of E. coli contamination are awaiting new test results Friday in the Seattle suburb of Mercer Island — one of the wealthiest towns in Washington state whose residents include billionaire Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The warning is unusual because most boil-water advisories hit small communities in rural areas. The city of 24,000 on an island in Lake Washington issued the second order Thursday after routine testing again turned up E. coli, and more than 60 businesses were told to close. Scroll down for video . Residents told to boil drinking water for the second time in a week because of E. coli contamination are awaiting new test results Friday in the Seattle suburb of Mercer Island . An advisory last weekend was lifted Monday after shuttering schools and restaurants. More chlorine is being added to the water — enough to make tap water smell like a swimming pool — and officials hoped to announce Friday whether samples are clean of the bacteria. There have been no reports of illness. Mercer Island gets its water from Seattle Public Utilities through a pipe along the Interstate 90 bridge, but no E. coli has been found in other parts of the Seattle water system. Local and state health officials at a news conference Thursday said they don't know how the E. coli is getting into the water. They thought it was a random minor incident that was cleared up Monday when samples came back clean after the first boil-water advisory. Meanwhile, Mercer Island schools remained open Friday by using bottled water, ""heat and eat"" meals and temporary washing stations in the restrooms. Teachers could use the incident as a learning opportunity to talk about millions of people around the world who do not have access to drinkable water, District Superintendent Gary Plano said in a statement. Some of the 62 restaurants, coffee shops and delis that were ordered to close could reopen with prepackaged food under the observation of the Seattle-King County Health Department. The city, with many waterfront homes on the 6-square-mile island, has a median household income of more than $127,000, according to census data for the ZIP code in 2012. The state median household income is about $59,000. Mercer Island has increased water sampling and inspections of construction sites in an attempt to find the source of the contamination. In addition to adding extra chlorine, crews are flushing water mains in potential problem areas. The city is asking residents to report if garden irrigation systems were connected without a backflow preventer. The presence of E. coli in a drinking-water sample usually indicates recent fecal contamination, Public Health Seattle & King County said Thursday. Most E. coli bacteria are harmless and exist in the intestines of people and warm-blooded animals. Anyone who drinks contaminated water could become ill, but infants, young children, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems are at increased risk. Symptoms include diarrhea and vomiting that may last several days.","No illnesses have been reported yet .

"This is the extraordinary moment a vehicle sank all the way into the beach after the driver got stuck. The 22-year-old driver from Bristol got into difficulty on Berrow Beach in Somerset after attempting to drive through deep mud in his Toyota Celica on Saturday evening. His wheels quickly sank into the infamous mudflats and as the tide drew closer he tried and failed to push it free. Scroll down for video . The Toyota Celica was quickly swallowed by dangerous mudflats on Berrow Beach in Somerset at weekend . Search and Rescue from nearby Burnham on Sea was called to the scene on Sunday morning but it was not possible to recover the car safely. Sedgemoor District Council, which manages Berrow Beach, says it was now in discussions with the car owner to arrange for it to be removed. The council's Resorts Manager Graham Newing said: 'We have spoken with the gentleman involved, who is arranging for recovery.' The six-mile long beach - the second longest stretch of sand in Europe - is infamous for its wide exposure of soft sand and mud at low tide and is patrolled between May 1 and September 30. The 22-year-old driver had been attempting to drive across the mud when he got stuck and had to abandon car . He called a nearby Search and Rescue the next morning which was also unable to recover the vehicle safely . Mudflats or tidal flats as they are sometimes known, are coastal wetlands that form when the tide comes in and mud and silt are deposited. The water mixes with the mud and silt, creating the muddy quicksand, which can be dangerous and treacherous. Councillor Tony Grimes, whose ward covers the beach, said he usually sees around two or three similar incidents every year. He told MailOnline: 'Quite frankly I find it amazing that people still try and do it - there are plenty of warning signs telling people to stay off. 'People just get a bit blasé and think it will be okay and it might be one minute but the next thing the tide comes in and they're stuck.' He added that the parish council has 'done everything it can' to prevent people from wandering too far and says it is a case of 'education'. 'There are wardens with loud speakers and plenty of warning signs so there really is no need for it. Berrow Beach, Somerset is infamous for its dangerous mudflats which are formed of deposited mud and silt . 'If people stick to the main part and don't go out too far then there wouldn't be any problems. But they get carried away.' The incident, which is one of several that have occurred this year along the stretch of coastline which has one of the world's highest tidal ranges raises fresh questions about the safety of vehicles on the beaches. However, Cllr Grimes noted that there are designated areas of the beach for cars and to ban all vehicles would be 'unrealistic'. In 2002 a five-year-old girl died on Berrow Beach when she became trapped in the mudflats while on a walk with her mother's boyfriend during a family holiday from Worcester. The RAF found the little girl face-down in the water and she later died in hospital.","22-year-old driver got into difficulty on Berrow Beach as the wheels of his Toyota Celica quickly sank on mudflat .

"Being hunched over a computer screen for hours at a time means three-quarters of us now suffer from back pain, experts say. Rather than wrenching the back with strenuous exercise or hard lifting, sedentary lifestyles are the main cause of problems. Lounging in front of a television or spending too long in bed are also major causes of back complaints, according to the British Chiropractic Association. Being hunched over a computer screen for hours at a time means three-quarters of us now suffer from back pain, says British Chiropractic Association . Some 82 per cent of people now spend six hours a day in front of a computer screen, the association found in a survey of 2,000 people. And 49 per cent of those questioned admitted they spent between two and six hours a day watching television. Chiropractor Rishi Loatey said: 'As a nation we're becoming increasingly sedentary and struggle to switch off - whether it's sitting at a desk or lounging on the sofa, hunching over a mobile device or lying in bed for too long, the effects of modern lifestyles are taking their toll. 'Understanding how to sit properly and keeping active will help improve posture, strengthen muscles and therefore reduce neck and back pain. Around 82 per cent of people now spend more than six hours a day in front of a computer screen . 'With 35 million working days a year lost to back and neck related problems it' s really important that people think about their back health when going about their daily business, and that they seek help from an expert if they are in pain to avoid more long term problems.' Some 77 per cent of people surveyed said they are currently experiencing back or neck pain or have done in the past. And 24 per cent said they suffer on a daily basis. The survey results suggest that 73 per cent spend more than six hours in bed, and 33 per cent spend between two and six hours looking at a laptop or tablet. Chiropractors recommend that when sitting at a desk people have their back straight, arms close to the body and computer screens level with the eyebrows. The seat base should be tilted slightly forward, allowing for the knees to be lower than the hips and the feet to be flat on the floor. They advise that people take a walk every half hour.","Three in four of us now suffer from bad pain, according to experts .

"Time is running out for 18 miners trapped underground after a coal mine collapsed in southern Turkey on Tuesday. Governor Murat Koca said the incident occurred at the Has Sekerler mine near the town of Ermenek in Karaman province, 300 miles south of Ankara close to Turkey's Mediterranean coast. A rescue team has been working all night and into Wednesday to free the trapped miners, who are believed to be located about 350 meters below ground. Aid: Locals watch as rescue workers try to save 18 miners trapped after a collapse in a mine in the Ermenek district in Karaman, Turkey . Turkish officials say the workers' chances of survival are slim unless they managed to reach a safety gallery. The flood occurred around 3pm local time when workers were eating their lunch, Kerim Pinarli, one of 16 miners who was able to escape, told NTV news channel. 'We smelled gas and heard our friends below shout, ""There's gas, don't come!"" We escaped by seconds,' Pinarli said. Mr Koca said the miners were trapped after water accumulated inside the mine and flooded a gallery where they were working. Turkey's emergency management agency, AFAD, said a broken pipe in the mine caused the flooding. Moving fast: Time is running out for the miners who failed to escape, and the team has been working all night . Catastrophe: Medics comfort a relative of one of the 18 miners trapped below ground . Emergency: Rescue workers attempt to pump water from the collapsed mine which has trapped the miners . Sahin Uyar, an official at the privately-owned coal mine, told NTV television the miners were stuck about 300 metres underground. 'At the moment, 18 of our colleagues are trapped. We are working to pump water out from three sections of the mine,' he told NTV, adding that so far rescue crews have had no contact with the trapped miners. He said the trapped workers' chances of survival were slim unless they had managed to reach a safety gallery. Turkey's ministers for energy and transportation are heading to the scene to oversee the rescue operation. Race against time: The miners are said to be trapped about 300 metres underground . Pictured is the town of Ermenek, in south west Turkey, where the 18 miners are trapped . Governor Murat Koca said the incident occurred at the Has Sekerler mine near the town of Ermenek in Karaman province, 300 miles south of Ankara close to Turkey's Mediterranean coast . In May, a fire inside a coal mine in the western town of Soma killed 301 miners. The fire exposed poor safety standards and superficial government inspections in many of the country's mines and led to more than two dozen arrests. General manager Ramazan Dogru and operations manager Akin Celik were among the 24 detained five days after a fire ripped through the mine choking and incinerating workers. The disaster sparked violent protests across Turkey, directed at mine owners accused of ignoring safety for profit, and at Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government, which is seen as too close to industry bosses.","A coal mine in Turkey has collapsed trapping 18 workers 300m underground .

"A British woman killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul wrote a tragic last message on Twitter just weeks before she died, asking: ‘I am back in Afghanistan and wonder what lies before me this time.’ Jeni Ayris, from Edinburgh, died alongside 11 fellow aviation workers when a female insurgent rammed a car laden with explosives into their minibus as they drove to the airport on Tuesday. Islamist group Hezb-e-Islami claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming it was in retaliation for the controversial American film allegedly lampooning the Prophet Mohammad which has sparked turmoil across the Muslim world. Scroll down for video . Bubbly: Jeni Ayris, who had been in Afghanistan for more than a month, was due to return home to see family and friends in Edinburgh only this weekend . Shocking attack: Ms Ayris, 47, died alongside 11 of her fellow aviation workers when a female suicide bomber rammed into their minibus . Ms Ayris, 47, who had been in . Afghanistan for little more than a month, was due to return home to see . her sister Patricia and friends in Scotland only this weekend. Heartbroken . friends described her today as a 'great cook who loved entertaining' and a passionate sailor who enjoyed boating on the Firth of Forth and . along the West Coast of Scotland. She had been working in the country for just over a year as a customer . relations manager for aviation firm Air Charter Solutions/BalmOral, organising . private flights for charities and NGOs into and out of the country. 'She loved her job,' said friend Richard Kellett, a restaurant manager and former Army captain in the Scots Guards. Grief: Ms Ayris was described as 'warm' and 'wonderful' by her distraught friends and family . 'She would go out there for three months at a time and come home for one. She was due to come home this weekend. ‘She loved it out there and always looked forward to going back when she came home on leave.’ He said Ms Ayris, who was born in South Africa but had lived in Scotland for 20 years and gained British nationality, had no immediate family apart from sister Patricia, who he said was ‘distraught’ over her death. Ms Ayris and a partner opened a cafe called Ndebele in Edinburgh several years ago, serving South African food. Tragic: The final tweet posted by Ms Ayris weeks before she died . Devastating: Ms Ayris had been working in the country for just over a year as a customer relations manager for aviation firm Air Charter Solutions, organising private flights for charities and NGOs into and out of the country . ‘Patricia got a call from the company only this morning telling her her sister had been killed in a roadside bomb. It wasn’t until later that she found out it was a suicide blast. ‘Patricia is distraught. Jeni was her only family and she cannot come to terms with the violent manner in which her sister was killed. ‘She was a wonderful woman and a wonderful friend. 'She loved sailing and spent time sailing in the Firth of Forth and on the West Coast of Scotland. 'She was a great cook and loved entertaining, dinners and parties at her house were always great fun. No chance: Afghan security personel scour the mangled remains of the minibus in which Ms Ayris died for clues . Abandoned possessions: Afghan security personnel carry bags belonging to foreign contractors . 'She was an amazing friend who could always be relied upon to help you out of any situation no matter how difficult it might be. She always had a great positive energy and a buzz about her.' Michael Hodgson, 39, who is from the Netherlands and is a close friend of Ms Ayris, set up a Facebook page in tribute to her. 'Jeni Ayris was a warm, kind and generous person with an everyday objective of helping everyone she met,' he said. 'She had a positive boundless energy which rubbed off on everyone, making her loss all the more hurtful. 'Jeni leaves behind a sister who is her only family as well as a huge number of friends across Scotland and the world who are all absolutely devastated by her tragic death. 'Although born in South Africa, Jeni was a British citizen and her home was firmly rooted in Edinburgh where she had lived for the last 17 years. Carnage: Security staff inspect the scene. Islamist group Hezb-e-Islami has claimed responsibility for the blast . 'She loved living in the UK and was very passionate about her life in Scotland. 'For 10 years she was a popular figure in Tollcross where she ran the Ndebele South African Cafe and Delicatessen. 'Jeni was highly respected and valued . in her job as a manager in the aviation sector where she was . responsible for the safe air travel of NGOs (non-governmental . organisations) throughout Afghanistan, and her contribution was her . practical way of helping Afghanistan move forward. 'At this moment her sister and close friends ask everyone to respect the privacy of the family and their loss.' Mr Hodgson met Ms Ayris when she first moved to Edinburgh, where they both worked as silver service waiters. Horrific sight: Bodies were seen lying by the mangled mini-van, which was thrown at least 50 metres . He said they 'just clicked' as friends and described her as his 'night and day' and 'like a sister'. A spokesman for the Foreign and . Commonwealth Office said: 'We can confirm that one of those killed in . the attack was a dual South African and British national. 'Our deepest sympathies are with the families of all those involved.' He said the office was liaising with the Afghan government and providing consular assistance. The firm Ms Ayris worked for, ACS/BalmOral, said today: BalmOral . Central Contracts can now confirm that all the people that were killed in the . Afghanistan suicide bomb blast on Tuesday the 18th September 2012 . have been identified. Putting out the flames: Afghanistan firefighters pour water on the remains of the Sedan that carried the bomber along a major highway leading to the airport . 'We have . been in contact with each of the families and relatives and will be keeping . them all up to date with the necessary arrangements to bring their remains back . to South Africa. 'BalmOral . Central Contracts wish to convey our sincere condolences to all involved and . affected by this random tragic event. We thank the South African aviation . community for their concern and assistance during these very difficult times.' The bomber was named by Afghan insurgents as Fatima, 22, who was reportedly wearing a suicide vest and blew herself up on a large avenue northwest of the city centre near the airport. Wreckage: An Afghan security officer investigates at the site of the attack, which is thought to have been carried out by a 22-year-old woman wearing a suicide vest . The criminal director for the Kabul . police department, Mohammad Zahir, said eight South Africans believed to be foreign . aviation company workers died in the . blast and ten Afghan bystanders were wounded. The other person killed was believed to be Afghan - possibly a driver or translator for the group. The explosion, which went off in front of a petrol station, was so powerful it hurled the minibus about 50 metres (46 yards). Reports from the scene said at least six . bodies lay next to the destroyed mini-van. Eight Afghan workers were also said to have been injured in the blast. Investigation: Nato's soldiers and Afghan forces inspect the scene after the latest outbreak of violence . An eyewitness at the scene said he was waiting for a bus to go to work at 6.45am when he saw a small white sedan ram into the mini-bus. 'The explosion was so powerful and loud that I could not hear anything for ten minutes,' said Abdullah Shah, a teacher waiting at a bus stop. 'It was early and there wasn't much traffic.' The bombing came a day after hundreds of Afghans burned cars and threw rocks at a U.S. military base in the capital in a demonstration against the anti-Islam film. One police vehicle was burned by the mob before they finally dispersed around midday yesterday. Proximity: The bomb blast happened near Kabul airport, killing nine and injuring eight others (file picture) Hizb-i-Islami is led by former warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The group has recently sought to participate in a so-far fruitless peace and reconciliation effort led by President Hamid Karzai. As part of the group's effort, it offered a peace plan that called for a broad-based government. Hizb-i-Islami is a radical Islamist militia that has thousands of fighters and followers across the north and east of Afghanistan. Its 65-year-old leader is a former Afghan prime minister and one-time U.S. ally who is now listed as a terrorist by Washington. Devastating: The incident was the first reported suicide car bombing ever to be carried out by a woman in Afghanistan . The Taliban have also threatened to increase their attacks against foreign targets to avenge the controversial film. Taliban fighters last week attacked a large British base in southern Afghanistan, killed two U.S. Marines and destroyed six fighter jets. Nato forces killed 14 insurgents and captured another who participated in the attack. In a torrent of violence blamed on the . film last week, the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans . were killed in an attack in Benghazi. U.S. and other foreign . embassies were stormed in cities in Asia, Africa and the Middle East by . furious Muslims. At least nine other people were killed. Shocking violence: The bomber was driving a Sedan and blew it up beside a minivan carrying foreigners on a major highway leading to Kabul's international airport . Widespread anger: Afghan police arrive at the scene of the attack, which was apparently launched in retaliation for a film mocking the Prophet Mohammad . The news will raise fears that anger . over the film will feed into deteriorating security as the U.S. and other . Western countries try to protect their forces from a rash of so-called . insider attacks by Afghan colleagues. The U.S. has sent ships, extra troops and special forces to protect U.S. interests and citizens in the Middle East, while a number of its embassies have evacuated staff and are on high alert for trouble. Despite Obama's efforts early in his tenure to improve relations with the Arab and Muslim world, the violence adds to a host of problems including the continued US military involvement in Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear programme, the Syrian civil war and the fall-out from the Arab Spring revolts.

"South Sydney hooker Issac Luke will miss Sunday's NRL grand final against Canterbury after the judiciary upheld his one-match ban for a dangerous throw. Luke bowed his head and looked at the floor after the verdict was read out by judiciary panel member Mal Cochrane, who spent 11 minutes deliberating with the two other panel members Chris McKenna and Michael Vella on Tuesday night. Judiciary chairman Paul Conlon echoed the thoughts of all Souths fans, officials and players when he immediately addressed Luke. 'We all know what that means,' he said. 'It is very unfortunate.' Scroll down for video . Luke was hit with the charge following a 38th minute tackle on Sydney Roosters forward Sonny Bill Williams in the Rabbitohs' 32-22 preliminary final win over the premiers at ANZ Stadium on Friday . 'The position player Williams was put in meant his head or neck could have been the first contact point with the ground' judiciary prosecutor Peter Kite said . Judiciary prosecutor Peter Kite argued the tackle on Williams was 'a classic grade one dangerous throw' 'Obviously not the result we were after,' Maguire said (pictured) Luke declined to comment as he left League Central following the decision. Rabbitohs coach Michael Maguire didn't answer questions from the phalanx of reporters and cameramen assembled but only gave a short statement. 'Obviously not the result we were after,' Maguire said. 'But I know I have a squad that are looking forward to preparing well all week and getting into Sunday's game.' Penrith-bound back-up rake Api Koroisau filled in capably for Luke earlier this year when the 27-year-old suffered a shoulder injury, and is likely to be called upon again to fill his role in the decider. Luke was hit with the charge following a 38th minute tackle on Sydney Roosters forward Sonny Bill Williams in the Rabbitohs' 32-22 preliminary final win over the premiers at ANZ Stadium on Friday. With the guilty verdict, Luke is hit with 200 penalty points, with 100 points equalling a one-match suspension, meaning he will also miss the Kiwis' opening Four Nations match against Australia in Brisbane on October 25. From the outset judiciary prosecutor Peter Kite argued the tackle on dual international Williams was 'a classic grade one dangerous throw'. 'There was an unacceptable risk of injury,' he continued.

"Police are searching for the parents of a one-year-old child after they abandoned him in his stroller on a street corner Saturday night. Officers heard the boy crying in his stroller on a street in downtown New Orleans at 5pm yesterday. Bystanders told officers the child had been there at least 45 minutes - and that there was no sign of his parents. Lost child: Police officers found this boy, whom they think is one year old, crying in his stroller, where he had been left for at least 45 minutes .

"The Spanish nurse who survived Ebola has spoken for the first time about her ordeal, saying the worst part was learning her dog had been put down. Teresa Romero has been in quarantine in Madrid since October 6 after she became the first person to contract the disease outside Africa while treating two infected missionaries. After learning Mrs Romero had become infected, Spanish authorities quarantined her and her husband, and put down the family dog Excalibur - claiming it could have spread the disease. Scroll down for video . Teresa Romero (pictured), the Spanish nurse who has survived Ebola, has spoken of her ordeal for the first time - saying the worst moment was when she learned her dog had been put down . Mrs Ramos, who has been in quarantine since October 6, says she plans to get a new puppy - 'a little Excalibur' - after authorities had her old dog put down over fears it could spread Ebola . Mrs Romero said: 'The worst part was in regard to my dog. Now I'm going to get a puppy. A little Excalibur.' Mrs Romero has tested negative for the infection twice in the last week, with 48 hours between each test, but will remain in hospital until she is fully recovered. Speaking about her recovery, she added: 'I feel newborn, that is how I feel. I have had a very hard time. I told [my family] I was feeling very bad. 'I told them that I was sick, that I was feeling awful. But I also told them to stay calm. 'What they do is to cheer me up. They tell me they are longing to take off their protective suits to hug and kiss me. 'They cheer me up constantly and ask my what I need all the time. I am thankful to death for them.' Mrs Romero caught Ebola after treating Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who died on September 25 after being infected with Ebola while he treated patients in Sierra Leone. Thousands of protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against officials' decision to put the animal down without testing to see whether it was infected first . Innocent animal: Ms Romero's husband Javier Limon Romero, was was under quarantine until yesterday, has also questioned the decision to put the animal down . Another Spanish priest, 75-year-old Miguel Pajares, had died in Madrid in August after being flown back from missionary work in Liberia. She was quarantined along with 14 other people who had come into contact with her for 21 days - the incubation period for the disease - though all have now been cleared. However the decision by Spanish authorities to put down her dog, Excalibur, without testing the animal to see whether it was infected caused widespread protests. At a news conference last week, her husband Javier questioned why the decision had been taken, saying the animal had not been to blame 'for anything'. Yesterday, Mr Romero went further, describing the animal as 'the son we never had', and adding that authorities had given him no chance to argue against the decision. In the U.S. a dog belonging to a nurse infected with Ebola was quarantined and tested negative, before being released. At a press conference yesterday Mr Romero described the animal as 'the son we never had', adding that authorities had given him no chance to argue against the decision . Mrs Romero became the first person to be infected with Ebola outside Africa after treating two missionaries. Her infection drew protests, with workers saying they were not being given the proper safety equipment . Thousands of angry protesters marched in the streets of Madrid calling on the government's health minister Ana Mato to resign after the pet's death on October 8. Ms Romero's recovery could prompt further criticism by the protesters, 390,000 of whom signed a petition urging officials to save Excalibur's life. Ms Romero was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease, and other drugs which a government spokesman declined to name. One was the experimental anti-viral medicine favipiravir, according to the respected national newspaper El Mundo. Romero was the only known sufferer of Ebola in Spain after the death of the two priests.","Teresa Romero has been in quarantine since October 6 suffering from Ebola .

"Despite warnings about the dangers of wildfires and drought-parched forests, the inferno that swirled through the California lumber town of Weed caught the entire community off guard. In just a few hours, wind-driven flames destroyed or damaged 100 homes, the saw mill and a church. At times, the fire moved so fast that residents had only a few minutes to get out of the way. On Tuesday, the 'Weed Like To Welcome You' town sign still stood, but nothing else was normal as stunned residents assessed the damage, took stock of what they lost and gave thanks for what was saved. Scroll down for video . Wasteland: The Boles Fire took residents of Weed, California, by surprise - raging through the town of 3,000 on Monday night and Tuesday and destroying 100 buildings - including the library and parts of the elementary school . Firefighters hose down the smoldering remains of a home,  in Weed, California. A fast-moving wildfire destroyed at least 100 structures before winds died down and firefighters got a line around most of the fire .

A bathtub is seen painted pink with fire retardant in the rubble of a home destroyed by a wildfire in Weed. Nearly everyone in the town was forced to flee Weed as the wildfire swept through . 'At the peak, essentially the entire town was evacuated,' state fire spokesman Robert Foxworthy said. Disastrous as it was for the community of 3,000 people, daybreak brought gratitude and relief that there were no reports of death or even serious injuries. The intense blaze erupted Monday south of Weed. Elsewhere in the state, hundreds of firefighters battled about a dozen other persistent blazes. The cause of the Weed fire is still under investigation. Winds gusting up to 40mph pushed the flames into town, where they quickly chewed through a hillside neighborhood. 'It went through here so fast it was unbelievable. I've never seen anything like this,' Jim Taylor, a retired butcher who has lived in the town for 30 years said Tuesday. 'I'm not a real religious person, but somebody was looking out for me.' Taylor said fire bombers dropped retardant over his house. As his home and his deck furniture turned pink from the retardant, another house nearby erupted into flames.  Across the street, pine and oak trees were burned to a crisp, and small flames and smoke drifted up from chunky embers. The town and the forest that surrounds it were a tinderbox this summer after three years of drought. And Weed's winds are notorious. The steady breezes were what attracted town founder Abner Weed to build his lumber business there in 1897, after he realized that wood dried more quickly when fanned by nature. Firefighters air-dropped red flame retardant across the town - painting entire houses with the  chemical .

The town's saw mill, once the world's largest, was among the structures damaged in the blaze. On Tuesday, chimneys were the only thing still standing in the rubble, and broken pipes spurted water over the blackened landscape. The remnants of the Holy Family Catholic Church were still smoldering, its metal girders twisted on the ground. 'I mean it was devastating,' said Maureen Campbell, the church's music minister who was baptized, confirmed and married at the church, along with her children. She lost her home to the fire. 'The house up there is no big deal. It can be rebuilt,' she said. 'But this is my family church, you know? It's much more endearing to me.' Tasha Davis, 30, said she was given two minutes to grab what she could from her apartment and evacuate. 'We then packed my car and sat on the road and just watched everything burn,' she said Tuesday in an email from Mount Shasta, where she spent the night with her family. Fire crews took advantage of calmer winds and firefighting aircraft Tuesday, gaining control in and around Weed. Flames still threatened in other parts of California. In Oakhurst, a foothill community south of Yosemite National Park, a fire that had burned 320 acres was 40 percent contained. About 600 residents from 200 homes remained evacuated, Madera County sheriff's spokeswoman Erica Stuart said. Farther north, a wildfire about 60 miles east of Sacramento forced the evacuation of 133 homes. El Dorado County sheriff's officials said residents of an additional 406 homes were being told to prepare to flee. More than 1,500 firefighters battled the blaze, which started in a remote area Saturday but exploded Sunday when it reached a canyon of thick, dry brush. It grew rapidly and had burned through more than 18 square miles as of Tuesday morning. It was only 5 percent contained. More than 4,000 wildfires have burned in California this year.

"Both Dairy Queen and Kmart are the latest stores to be plagued with computer security breaches. Dairy Queen said on Thursday that its payment systems were breached by hackers who may have gained access to customer names, credit and debit card numbers and expiration dates. The ice cream and fast food chain says 395 of its stores around the country were affected. The data breach happened between August and September. Hacked: dairy Queen payment systems were breached by hackers who may have gained access to customer names, credit and debit card numbers and expiration dates . Customer alert: Retailer Sears Holdings Corp said the payment data system at its Kmart unit had been breached, and that certain debit and credit card numbers could have been compromised . Dairy Queen says it worked with law enforcement authorities and credit card companies to investigate the breach. It says there's no evidence Social Security numbers, personal identification numbers or email addresses were accessed. The Edina, Minnesota-based company is offering customers free identity repair services. Retailer Sears Holdings Corp said the payment data system at its Kmart unit had been breached, and that certain debit and credit card numbers could have been compromised. The data hacking at Kmart discount stores comes after a slew of data breaches at U.S. companies over the last two years. Earlier this month, it was revealed that personal data from 83 million households and small business accounts were exposed when computer systems at JPMorgan Chase & Co were compromised, making it one of the biggest data breaches in history. Kmart, which launched an investigation into the hacking, apologised to its customers on Friday and said it was working with federal authorities, banking partners and security firms in the probe. Sears, whose shares were little changed in extended trading, said there was no evidence that kmart.com had been compromised. The investigation, which indicates the breach began in September, revealed that no personal information, debit card PIN numbers, email addresses and social security numbers were obtained by the hackers. Bond insurer MBIA also reported a server breach this month that compromised the data of thousands of local U.S. government entities. Other widespread breaches include those of Target Corp, Home Depot Inc, Michaels Stores Inc and Neiman Marcus.

"The image of Gerard Pique sat on the bench at Amsterdam, four days after the pictures of him sat in the stands at the Nou Camp, will have had more than one Premier League manager thinking: 'What a waste, what I wouldn’t give for the chance to play him in my side.' Louis van Gaal, about whom Pique tells the story of being pushed over by as a teenage apprentice at the Nou Camp, and being told he wasn’t strong enough to be a defender by the boisterous then-Barcelona manager, will know that Pique has more experience and defensive know-how in his locker than the sum total of the Dutchman’s current Old Trafford resources. Arsene Wenger, fresh from seeing his defence surrender a three-goal lead against Anderlecht will be similarly puzzled as to why someone who has so much of the composure and vision to turn defence into attack quickly, something he loves in a defender, is currently not good enough to play for Barcelona. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pique: If I joined an English club it would be Man Utd (archive) Gerard Pique watches from the stands as Barcelona lose to Celta Vigo on Saturday night . Pique celebrates after Barcelona's Champions League final win over United at Wembley in 2011 . There are Premier League suitors crying out for a top defender if Pique stays on the sidelines and as we approach the winter transfer window it will only increase their appetites to sign him. As things stand there would be two main obstacles to him returning to England. The first is his own desire to make things work at Barcelona and the second is Barca’s current transfer ban. Pique told Sportsmail before the Clasico: 'I left a lot of friends at United and I was really happy there even though I did not play as much as I wanted to. But I always said that I want to retire here (Barcelona) and if it is possible I want to stay here all my career.' Pique shares a joke with Neymar during training at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday . The loyalty to the club his grandfather was a director of and who he helped lead to two European Cups under Pep Guardiola is genuine and persuading him to walk away would not be easy. What he also said in that frank and open interview ahead of the visit to the Bernabeu was: 'At this moment I am not thinking about leaving,' adding: 'I am really happy if it is true that Manchester United want me but I want to stay.' He always speaks warmly of United and joked about how frustrating it was to be in the shadow of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, two players who he said never seemed to get so much as a red card that would at least give him the chance to play. Pique celebrates scoring for Manchester United against Dynamo Kiev with Nemanja Vidic in 2007 . He is also in contact with Cesc Fabregas who knows what it is like to feel unappreciated at the Nou Camp and forced to find a first team berth somewhere else. In an ideal world Fabregas would still be living up the coast from Barcelona in Arenys de Mar, close to his family and would be ever-present in the Barca team but players must go where best suits their career and seeing how Fabregas has rejuvenated at Chelsea will have at least made him think. The other major obstacle to something happening as soon as January is the transfer ban hanging over Barcelona. They cannot sign anyone until the end of the season at the earliest so why would they weaken their defensive resources by losing Pique without being able to sign replacements? In December they will find out if the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is going to allow them to sign players at the end of the season – reducing the current ban on two transfer windows to just one. If CAS does come down in their favour then Premier League suitors might begin their enquiries. Pique's loyalty to Barca and the club's transfer ban could stand in the way of him moving back to England . The other option open to the defender is to wait out Luis Enrique’s reign. Barcelona are in the midst of an unstable period when coaches staying for four seasons as Pep Guardiola did seem long gone. The Barcelona coach could also change his mind about Pique and bring him back in to the fold. With his personal favourite Jeremy Mathieu injured on Wednesday night and the Barca board’s other summer signing Thomas Vermaelen still nowhere near fitness, Pique’s absence from the starting line-up seemed even more bizarre. Most Barca fans want Javier Mascherano moved into a midfield weakened by Sergio Busquets’ drop in form and Pique back alongside Marc Bartra, but for now Enrique does not agree. Pique has time for a smile in the stands despite being dropped by Luis Enrique . Asked after Wednesday’s game what exactly it is he is looking for from Pique: 'A change in attitude or performance?' The Barca coach hesitated over his answer, buying time by asking for the question to be repeated, and ultimately side-stepped the issue by saying he didn’t speak about individuals and just wanted the 'maximum' from everybody. Pique may not be the player he was four years ago when Spain and Barca were in their pomp, but he remains good enough for Barcelona’s current defensive options and comfortably good enough to walk into most Premier League defences. As it becomes increasingly difficult to understand him being left out in the cold, those who would welcome him with open arms will continue to be encouraged. Enrique (centre) has preferred Jeremy Mathieu, Javier Mascherano and Marc Bartra at centre back .","Gerard Pique dropped by Barcelona for games against Celta Vigo and Ajax .

"Four University of Nebraska-Lincoln students have been arrested after a freshman died of alcohol poisoning. Clayton Real, 18, was found dead in a room at FarmHouse fraternity house near campus on September 5. The students, who are members of the fraternity, each face a felony charge of procuring alcohol to a minor resulting in death. They were sent to the Lancaster County jail, and a hearing is scheduled Friday. Three other students, including another fraternity member, face citations. Four fraternity brothers have been arrested after freshman Clayton Real died of alcohol poisoning in September . Affidavits show Mr Real's cause of death was acute alcohol intoxication and his blood alcohol content was .365. Following the arrests, the school suspended the fraternity chapter indefinitely. The decision means more than 20 freshmen living in the house will need to find another place to live, according to university spokesman Steve Smith. The university requires freshmen to live on campus, and the house will no longer be approved for such purposes. 'We have taken appropriate action, given the seriousness of the matter,' said Juan Franco, the university vice chancellor for student affairs. The four students, from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (pictured) each face a felony charge of procuring alcohol for a minor resulting in death . The affidavits indicate fraternity members hosted a party at a separate house the night before Mr Real was found. Alcohol was provided to underage attendees, including Mr Real, according to the documents. Witnesses told investigators that Real became intoxicated and passed out. He was brought back to the fraternity house and was left to sleep in his room, according to the affidavits. Smith said it's too early to say what disciplinary action the students may face from the university.","Clayton Real, 18, was found dead at a fraternity house on September 5 .

"Heartbeat recognition could soon be used to unlock doors, start cars and even pay for your shopping thanks to new, wearable software currently under development. The Nymi is a lightweight, wearable wristband which authenticates a user’s identity through their electrocardiogram (ECG) - or heartbeat rhythm. Canadian company Bionym, the creator of Nymi, say the technology is more unique and harder to forge than a fingerprint. The Nymi works through an electronics module that incorporates an ECG sensor with two electrodes . The Nymi’s ECG recognition algorithms observe the shape of the wearer's heartbeat, extracting unique and consistent features. The hi-tech bracelet works by reading the wearer's ECG 'wave pattern' and finding its unique identifiers to use as an alternative to asking for a Pin number or password. The technology is currently being tested out with £9 million in funding from financial companies including Mastercard. The Nymi is a wristband which authenticates a user’s identity through their ECG - or heartbeat rhythm . The hi-tech bracelet works by reading the wearer's ECG 'wave pattern' and finding its unique identifiers . It's creators say the Nymi is robust against a wide variety of health issues, and even if the rhythm of the wearer's heartbeat varies - for instance, during exercise - the shape of the unique ECG wave pattern is still recognisable and the device will still work. During authentication the system is able to ignore low frequency anomalies and will still correctly identify its owner, while a medical condition such as cardiac arrhythmia or the use of pacemakers will not impact the Nymi’s performance because every heartbeat, even an irregular one, has a unique signature. Founded in 2011, Bionym is based in Toronto and the project is currently being privately-funded by Ignition Partners, Relay Ventures, Mastercard and Salesforce Ventures. The Nymi Band is its first product, which it bills as a 'wearable technology device that delivers persistent identity experiences by using the wearer's unique electric cardiac signature as a biometric.' Its creators say even if the rhythm of the wearer's heartbeat varies - for instance, during exercise - the shape of the unique ECG wave pattern is still recognisable and the device will still work . When the Nymi is activated, it communicates a secure, digitally signed identity credential via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to smart devices  - everything from a smartphone, to a vehicle, to a locked door. Unlike an iris scan or fingerprint sensor, the device can take a reading without the wearer interacting with it. Balaji Gopalan, a director at Bionym, said: 'Anywhere you go the bracelet will identify you to other devices, which could be the payments wallet on your smartphone, or in future, cash machines, cars and computers. 'It is also mugger-proof because the bracelet forms a circular electrical circuit that wipes the device when disconnected - that is, taken off.' The wristband has an electronics module which incorporates an ECG sensor with two electrodes – located on the top and bottom of the module. One electrode touches the wrist, and one is exposed on the other side. ECG data is captured when the user touches the top‐side electrode with the opposite hand. The wearer is authenticated when they first put on the wristband, which enables continuous  access to services and devices via wireless communication. As soon as it is removed from the wearer’s body, it becomes deactivated.","The Nymi authenticates user’s identity through the rhythm of their heartbeat .

"A young amputee who was forced by a lifelong condition to have both her legs removed has become a model. Lizzy Holmes, 24, who was born with 'club foot' - meaning both her feet were back to front - has suffered a lifetime of chronic pain and endured 36 operations, the first when she was just 10 weeks old. Her first leg was amputated below the knee the day after her wedding to soldier Lewis Georgeson, 21. Now her other leg has been amputated - but that hasn't stopped her launching a modelling career.

Lizzy, from Oakwood, Leeds, was born with the condition, which has meant a lot of pain and operations, and regular morphine doses just to manage the pain. 'I may never be completely pain-free, as the way I've walked has affected my spine, but I already feel much better,' she said. 'While I am fit and young I can adapt to my new life. I don't let my disability stop me from doing anything. I love to swim and I am looking forward to hopefully raising some money myself so I can buy some special wet legs to swim properly.'

"Shrien Dewani hired a driver to have 'a woman removed from sight' in a staged honeymoon carjacking just minutes after arriving in Cape Town, his murder trial has heard. Zola Tongo was recruited by Dewani for the contract killing of his wife Anni Dewani, 28, after dropping the couple off at a five-star hotel in Cape Town where they were spending part of their honeymoon. Tongo is currently serving 18 years for his role in the murder of Mrs Dewani in November 2010, and has always claimed it was Dewani who masterminded it. Scroll down for video . Murder accused Shrien Dewani hired taxi driver Zola Tongo to kill his wife Anni, just minutes after arriving in South Africa to begin his honeymoon, a South African court has heard . Tongo, who is currently serving 18 years jail for the murder, said Dewani approached him about the contract killing after he dropped the newlyweds off at their hotel, having collected them at the airport . The Swedish newlywed was found dead from a single gunshot wound to her neck, still wearing her evening dress, in the back of Tongo's abandoned car after it was ambushed during a late night township tour. Flanked by heavily-armed prison guards, bald-headed Tongo told the court that Dewani had approached him about 'a job' after checking in to the Cape Grace hotel after he had picked the couple up from the airport. Dewani, 34, promised to pay £1,350 for her murder and £282 for organising it, Cape Town's high court was told. Once Tongo had agreed to make inquiries with a friend who would have better contacts, the men swapped numbers and kept in touch. The following day – the morning of Mrs Dewani's murder, Tonga took Dewani to change a large amount of cash, and thrashed out the details of the murder. The wealthy Bristol-based businessman had already hatched a plan, the court heard. Tongo said when he picked the newlyweds up from dinner, shortly before the murder was to take place, they seemed happy, the car was 'full of laughter' 'He [Dewani] wanted a car to be hijacked, and they must be robbed, then they must drop me along the way and they must also drop him along the way. And they must kill the woman,' Tongo told Cape Town's high court via an interpreter. Dewani looked closely at Tongo throughout his evidence, making notes which he occasionally sent over the dock to his legal team. Tongo was put in touch with two gunmen Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe who agreed to carry out the hit in Gugulethu, a township outside the city centre. The men met up to finalise the details hours before Tongo was due to collect the the Dewanis from their hotel and drive them to a restaurant. After they had agreed the location where the hitmen would lie in wait to ambush the vehicle, Tongo went home and had a change of heart. Anni was found dead from a single gunshot wound to her neck, still wearing her evening dress, in the back of Tongo's abandoned car after it was ambushed during a late night township tour in November 2010 . 'My knees were shaking,' he told the court, as Mrs Dewani's family sat forward, straining to hear every painful detail about the plot that ended her life. Tongo said he tried but failed to find another driver to carry out the job. He later collected Dewani and his 'beautiful' bride from the Cape Grace and took them on a city tour before dropping them at a restaurant out of town. Tongo stayed in touch with Dewani and the killers during the meal, and when he picked them up they seemed happy, the car was 'full of laughter', he said. But as he drove to the appointed corner in Gugulethu the two killers were not there which prompted Dewani to look at him in the rear view mirror with 'big eyes' and send him a text message demanding to know what had happened. Tongo will continue giving evidence tomorrow. Dewani denies five charges including murder and kidnapping.","Zola Tongo is already serving 18 years for the murder of Anni Dewani .
