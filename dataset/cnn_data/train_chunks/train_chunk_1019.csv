"Police are hunting a saboteur who left hundreds of drawing pins on a cycle track where racing bikers were travelling at speeds of up to 50mph. The spikes, which were placed on a downhill stretch of road during a cycling event near Bridgend in South Wales, were painted black to blend in with the surface. More than 70 competitors were left with punctures as a result of the prank, which some are claiming is ‘attempted murder’, after the tacks were scattered on a hairpin bend. Scroll down for video . Riders can be seen at the side of the road after hundreds of drawing pins were scattered on a cycle track . Cyclist Richard Manning, 46, from Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire was one of the people taking part in the Valleys Velo Sportive and rode over the pins. He had been travelling at about 50mph when he noticed his front wheel clicking but was fortunate enough to stop safely and repair his inner tube. He said: ‘I only hope that the culprits are caught and that their punishment is enough to dissuade from this. ‘The placement of these drawing pins on a really fast descent, just before a hairpin bend can only lead to the conclusion that the saboteur was hoping to cause serious injury - or even death. ‘Add to this painting them black to camouflage them on the road shows a level of planning I find deeply distressing.’ Rider Gary Dawes posted on Twitter: ‘Black painted drawing pins scattered as sabotage on a fast descent is nothing less than attempted murder.’ The cyclists can be seen at the side of the road after cycling over the pins and puncturing their tyres . In a video posted on YouTube, several riders can be seen pitched up on the side of the road attempting to repair their punctures. Mr Manning added that one cyclist he spoke with had five separate punctures. No one is thought to have been injured during the race. Police are working with race organisers to investigate the act of sabotage which took place on Sunday, September 28. Organiser Jamie Rowland said: ‘I couldn't believe it when I first received the call to say what was happening. More than 70 competitors were left with punctures as a result of 'prank' after they were put on a hairpin bend . One cyclist has claimed that the sabotage is 'attempted murder' after the pins were painted black to blend in . ‘My heart sunk thinking of the riders and their safety who were unfortunately caught up in the unfolding events, all their training and effort undone by some mindless idiot.’ It is not the first incident of its kind - earlier this year a race in the New Forest was sabotaged. Nails were strewn along a stretch of road in Bransgore, Hampshire, as more than 20 participants in the Wiggle Sportive suffered punctures. And in 2012 French police investigated an attack on the Tour de France after tacks were scattered at stage 14 of the race. The cyclists were taking part in the Valleys Velo Sportive at Dare Valley Country Park last Sunday .","Pins were placed on a downhill stretch of road during race in South Wales .

"Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne looked to have scored the catch of the day as the smiling star netted two huge fish during an outing with a friend. The troubled star, who was treated in hospital last month after he was found staggering in the street during an alcoholic relapse, looked in better health than a few weeks ago, and beamed as he reeled in the trout. However, he did appear to be toasting his success on the water with a  lager, apparently sipping from a can of Stella Artois beer on the banks of the lake at the Rockbourne trout fishery near Fordingbridge, Hampshire. Scroll down for video . Catch of the day: Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne netted two huge fish during an outing with a friend . Time for a drink: The star appeared to be toasting his success on the water with a lager, apparently sipping from a can of Stella Artois beer on the banks of the lake at the Rockbourne trout fishery . Day out: The troubled star, who was treated in hospital last month after he was found staggering in the street during an alcoholic relapse, looked in better health than a few weeks ago . Fellow fishermen said he had pulled the can from a blue bag bearing the slogan 'Keep Calm And Carry', but had just stuck to one beer, and appeared to be sober. The midfielder, whose career included stints at Tottenham Hotspur, Glasgow Rangers and Lazio, chatted with fellow anglers, and posed of for pictures with his haul, giving one of the trout a kiss. 'It was great to see him healthier and happier than recently. He was smiling and really seemed to be enjoying himself,' one fisherman told the Daily Mirror. He added: 'I only ever saw him drinking from one can and he seemed happy and sober.' In August, Gascoigne was taken to hospital after he was pictured clutching a bottle of gin in the street near his rented apartment in Sandbanks, Poole. Success: The beaming midfielder seemed happy with his catch, posing up with his haul and giving one of the trout a kiss . He was also seen wandering the streets outside his expensive apartment block, holding a carrier bag full of cans of Stella Artois, and sitting with his head in his hands. Neighbours called 999 for help after finding the midfielder slumped against a wall, and an ambulance arrived to take the former England star to hospital. After pictures emerged showing Gascoigne looking much older than 47, looking gaunt with sunken eyes, QPR manager Harry Redknapp, who also lives Sandbanks, offered him the chance to work alongside him in football. Finding the net: Gascoigne hauls in his catch as he enjoys the New Forest sunshine . Can: Fellow fishermen said he had pulled the can from a blue bag bearing the slogan 'Keep Calm And Carry', but had just stuck to one beer, and appeared to be sober . He said: 'I saw him about a month ago and said ""I'll pick you up in the mornings, Gazza, come training with me and do a bit of work with the kids"". I’d love it if he could do that. It's an open invitation. 'He's a great lad and it's sad to see what’s happened to him and how he's looking at the moment.' In a TV documentary shown last September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him. He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, having found been unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky. Good spirits:  Fellow anglers said Gascoigne had seemed 'healthier and happier' as he enjoyed his fishing trip . Afficionado: Gascoigne has long been known for his love of fishing . Since then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs, particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago. Earlier this month, he was seen crashing a golf buggy into a ditch after losing control of the 15mpg vehicle at the Playgolf course in Bournemouth. He was said to be dazed but unhurt after the incident. Days later he was photographed cradling a chicken at a pub in Hampshire, and the next day apparently being turned away from an off-licence in Poole. Struggle: Gascoigne has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs, particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago . Past activities: Earlier this month, Gascoigne was seen crashing a golf buggy into a ditch after losing control of the 15mpg vehicle at the Playgolf course in Bournemouth . Treatment: For the past four years, Gascoigne, pictured with his fishing flies, has been living in Poole, where he is an occasional patient at the nearby Providence Project rehabilitation centre . For the past four years, Gascoigne has been living in Poole, where he is an occasional patient at the nearby Providence Project rehabilitation centre, but was reportedly due to be evicted from his penthouse flat earlier this month after a string of disturbances. The director of the management company in charge of the flats has dismissed claims he is being forced to leave, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract. On September 10, he was arrested for allegedly throwing a brick at a van outside his home in Sandbanks and questioned on suspicion of criminal damage. It is believed it followed an altercation with a photographer. He was released on bail until October pending further enquiries . In 2010, he called a radio station to inform them he was off to search for fugitive Raoul Moat while he was hiding from police officers, taking with him a fishing rod, lager and some chicken. Done fishin': Gascoigne poses with one of his trout while sitting on a ride-on mower at the fishery . On the move: Gascoigne tests out a small truck at the New Forest fishing lake . He later admitted he did not realise that the former bouncer had shot a police officer in the face and admitted he feels 'guilty' about the incident. Moat died following a stand-off with police. Gascoigne said in a radio interview at the time: 'He is willing to give in now. I just want to give him some therapy and say ""come on Moaty, it's Gazza.""' He later told the Daily Express: 'I thought I could take him fishing because stuff like that has worked on me. But his situation was different from mine.' In a TV documentary shown last September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him. He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, having been found unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky. Since then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs, particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago. Last year his friends DJ Chris Evans and ex-England cricketer Ronnie Irani paid for Gascoigne to attend a rehab clinic in Arizona. Hunter Davies, who co-wrote the former star's 2004 autobiography, said: 'He doesn’t even like alcohol. He hates the taste of it. 'I’ve been with him when he’s poured it into flower pots, because he finds it so revolting. But then he will get depressed, and just want to get obliterated.' Despite his demons, he is still remembered fondly by fans of the clubs he played for - including Newcastle United, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough - for his brilliance on the pitch. He starred in midfield for Terry Venables' England side during Euro 96, where his virtuoso goal against Scotland was topped off with an equally memorable celebration. Six years earlier he was seen crying on the pitch after being booked in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup against West Germany. The booking making him unable to play in the final.","Former footballer Paul Gascoigne visited a trout fishery in the New Forest .

"Robots already live amongst us, but should they have the same rights as humans and should we be allowed to torture them? They may sound like questions from science fiction films but these are the kinds of question that will need to be answered in the not too distant future. BBC reports that Kate Darling, a researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is truly fond of experimenting and isn't afraid to do terrible things to silly robots. Scroll down for video... Robotic feelings: Aww, look how cute he looks. But remember, it's only a robot! Robot ethics: Kate Darling (pictured), a researcher at MIT asks as we form such strong emotional bonds with machines that people can¿t be cruel to them even though they know they are not alive. So should robots have rights? He's smiling and he loves you: Watching Pleo the dinosaur being tortured prompts strong physiological and emotional reactions in people . As a part of her psychology experiment, Darling offered people to play with a Pleo robot, a toy dinosaur for children. The cute soft Pleo has trusting eyes and affectionate movements. When you take it out of the pack, it is like a newborn puppy – it can’t walk and you have to teach it everything. But after an hour of hugs and affection, Darling changes her tune. She gives the participants knives, hatchets and other weapons, and orders to torture and dismember their toys. What happens next 'is much more dramatic than we ever anticipated,' she says. Most of the participants refused to go along with her orders. Under the surface: Perhaps if Pleo didn¿t have its soft skin, might it be easier to see the bot as the machine it is, made up of metal, wires and bits of plastic? Kate Darling: Darling asked people to play with a Pleo robot, a child¿s toy dinosaur. The soft green Pleo has trusting eyes and affectionate movements. When you take one out of the box, it acts like a helpless newborn puppy . For Darling, our reaction to robot cruelty is important because a new wave of machines is forcing us to reconsider our relationship with them. When Darling described her Pleo experiment at a lecture, she made the case that mistreating certain kinds of robots could soon become unacceptable and abusive in the eyes of society. She even believes that we may need a set of 'robot rights'. Until not long ago, the idea of robot rights had been left to the science fiction writers. Perhaps that’s because the machines around us have been unsophisticated. Nobody feels anxious about throwing away a toaster or a remote-control toy car, the situation changes when it comes to modern so-called 'social robots'. They display autonomous behavior, show interest and act familiar to pets or babies, as if they are alive, which triggers our emotions, and often we can’t help it, adds Darling. Emotional: After an hour allowing people to tickle and cuddle these loveable dinosaurs, Darling turned executioner. She gave the participants knives, hatchets and other weapons, and ordered them to torture and dismember their toys . Partners: It's easy to become attached to robots that appear to have human-like qualities . Playing to your emotions: In an experiment where children held a Furby upside down, even children couldn¿t stand the way it was programmed to cry and say 'Me scared' In an experiment conducted in 2011, children were asked to hold upside down a Barbie doll, a hamster and a Furby toy for as long as they felt comfortable. While the children held the doll upside down until their arms got tired, they soon stopped torturing the wriggling hamster, and after a little while, the Furby too. They were old enough to know the Furby was a toy, but couldn’t stand the way it was programmed to cry and say 'Me scared'. Some people give names to their vacuum cleaners, says Darling. Soldiers honor their robots with 'medals' or hold funerals for them. She cites one particularly striking example of a military robot who was created in order to defuse landmines by stepping on them. Cause for concern? Robots may appear to have human-like qualities, but could you ever bring it upon yourself to physically torture them? What a cute dog! Until recently, the idea of robot rights had been left to the realms of science fiction. Perhaps that¿s because the real machines surrounding us have been relatively unsophisticated . Number five is alive! 27 years after Short Circuit came out, researchers are converging on the idea that if a robot looks like it is alive, we feel empathy towards them, even though we know they are artificial . In a test, the explosions ripped off most of the robot’s legs, and yet the crippled machine continued to limp along. Watching the robot struggle, the colonel in charge called off the test because it was 'inhumane'. Another experiment was conducted by the researchers from the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. They used machines to track people’s reactions to a video of somebody torturing a robotic pet – choking it, putting it inside a plastic bag or striking it. The physiological and emotional responses they measured were much stronger than expected, although they were aware of watching a robot.","MIT researcher asks if we become attached to our robots, can we avoid having human emotions towards them?
Experiments involved torturing toys after letting children play with them .
The kids found it incredibly difficult to destroy the toys as they became attached even after a short time .

"Madison Bumgarner might want to think twice before driving the brand new  truck General Motors gave him for winning World Series MVP.

"Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed it took him just 10 seconds to turn down the England job. The former Manchester United manager was approached twice . by the Football Association to take over the national side, first in 1999 . prior to the appointment of Kevin Keegan and then in 2001 before Sven . Goran Eriksson was given the job. And, speaking at the launch of his new book, My Autobiography, Ferguson admitted he didn't have to think twice before rejecting the opportunity. VIDEO: Sir Alex Ferguson on turning down England . Main man: Sir Alex Ferguson prepares to speak ahead of the launch of his latest book, My Autobiography . Second choice: Kevin Keegan (left) and Sven Goran Eriksson took over after Ferguson turned down England job . 'It was my great opportunity in life to relegate them,' he said. 'There was no way I could have taken the job. Adam Crozier was the first one to come. We met at Old Trafford and he made an offer. 'It didn’t take me long [to turn it down] – 10 seconds. I thought about it for 10 seconds. Never in a million years could I manage England. Think of me going back to Scotland. Dearie me.' In his book, Ferguson also described the job as a 'bed of nails.' He went on to admit he expects an immediate response from Roy Keane after claiming the former Old Trafford captain's personality changed towards the end of his time at the club. He wrote of the ‘relief’ that was felt in the dressing room when the man with ‘the most savage tongue’ left the club in a blaze of controversy in 2005 after his dominance in the midfield began to wane. The final straw, however, was Keane’s explosive interview on the club’s official channel, MUTV, in November 2005. Happier days: Ferguson's relationship with Roy Keane deteriorated before the midfielder left the club in 2005 . And Ferguson is now braced for the Irishman's comeback. 'The nature of the man you can expect that,' he said at his launch. 'That is the type of personality Roy is. The reason I had to explain it: it happened so quick, his actions were so quick. For one reason or another he decided to criticise his own team-mates. We couldn’t release the video. 'Two of our young players got booed at a match and we decided we had to do something. I couldn’t lose my control in his particular situation. If I had of let it pass the players would have viewed me differently. Throughout my career I’ve been strong enough. 'Roy overstepped his mark and there was no other thing we could do. We did well by him, paid up his contract, gave him a testimonial in front of 75,000 people. We did everything to honour the player he was for Manchester United.' Revelations: Ferguson's new book documents his exceptional spell as manager of Manchester United .

Ferguson, who was speaking in central London, also expanded on his . relationship with David Beckham, claiming the former England captain . changed after he met his future wife Victoria. 'The . big problem for me, I’m a football man, he fell in love with Victoria – . that changed everything. Being a football man, I had to think about . where we were going for that,' he added.

'He reinvented himself a . couple of times to go to AC Milan then PSG. That’s because of his . natural stamina. At the end I think he did miss the big time football.

But in one exclusive part of the capital records are being set – with the cost of the average home breaking through the £1million barrier. Figures from the Land Registry yesterday showed that a typical property in Kensington and Chelsea would set a buyer back £1,022,515. Those lucky enough to have bought 15 years ago – when the average price was just £240,000 – would have quadrupled their money. Buyers are not guaranteed to get much for their cash, with a 689sq ft one-bedroom flat in the royal London borough on the market for a seven-figure sum. The vendor is asking more than six  times the price of the average home in England and Wales of £160,417. Space is at such a premium that a double garage in Knightsbridge has been put up for sale with the estate agency WA Ellis for an extraordinary £525,000. The majority of buyers of these ‘prime’ properties are foreigners, according to another estate agency, Knight Frank. Over the past year, 55 per cent of its sales have been to non-Britons, with Russian, Indian and French buyers topping the list. Expensive: This attractive property in Chelsea Park Gardens is on the market for £11,250,000 (left) while the classic Chelsea townhouse (right) has been priced at 3,650,000 . Peter Rollings, of estate agents . Marsh & Parsons, said: ‘London has become a store of wealth. We are . still selling to people who will not even live in the properties they . buy, and some will not rent them out. You can buy a one-bedroom flat in . Chelsea for £600,000, but to the man in the street this sounds . ridiculous.’ The Land . Registry figures show that prices have jumped by 11.6 per cent over the . past year in Kensington and Chelsea, putting more than £100,000 on to . the value of a home. Nick . Gaunt, of Knight Frank in Chelsea, said: ‘In the last week or so, I have . dealt with Nigerians, South Africans, Irish, Italians and Iranians as . well as people from Turkey and Switzerland and of course the UK buyer.

"The son of a man killed by a drugs overdose given by a foreign doctor said today he would not be 'shut up' despite being ordered to pay the medic thousands of pounds in legal costs for calling him an 'animal'. An inquest found David Gray, 70, was unlawfully killed in 2008 after Dr Daniel Ubani, who was working as an out-of-hours locum on his first shift in the UK, fatally administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine. Mr Gray's son, Rory, 49, has been sued in a German court by Ubani after he and his brother Stuart, himself a GP, confronted the doctor at a Bavarian conference and called him an 'animal', 'charlatan' and a 'killer'. Dr Ubani, who now works in Germany as a doctor after being struck off in Britain, sued Mr Gray and secured a ruling demanding he pays three quarters of Dr Ubani's legal costs and writes a letter promising never to call him an animal again. But Mr Gray said it would not change his belief that Dr Ubani presents a danger to the public, even though the German authorities are satisfied he is safe to practise. Court battle: Rory Grey (right), whose father was killed by a drugs overdose given by foreign doctor Daniel Ubani (left) has been ordered to pay thousands of pounds after being sued by the medic for calling him an 'animal' He said: 'He's tried to shut us up and it shows a complete lack of remorse. His entire agenda is to prevent the truth coming out'. 'I have been banned from using a certain phrase and I won't use that phrase. But I will continue to say that Ubani is a charlatan and a killer'. His father had been suffering renal colic when he was treated by Nigerian-born Dr Ubani at his home on February 16, 2008, and died from a massive diamorphine overdose. His death highlighted national concerns about the standard of locum doctors from abroad working in the UK. Coroner William Morris described Mr Gray's death as 'gross negligence and manslaughter' and said Dr Ubani was 'incompetent'. Dr Ubani admitted he had confused the morphine with another drug. He had flown into the UK the day before his 12-hour Cambridgeshire shift for GP service provider Take Care Now, and had only had a few hours' sleep, a GMC panel was told. A doctor who gave him an induction expressed concerns that Dr Ubani had no NHS experience, did not know the area, and that he did not have enough time to properly train him. The disgraced doctor has since refused to return to the UK, where he has been struck off the medical register. Error: An inquest found David Gray, 70, (left) was unlawfully killed in 2008 after Dr Ubani, who was working as an out-of-hours locum on his first shift in the UK, fatally administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine . Four years ago Mr Gray's sons sought him out and called Nigerian-born Ubani a 'charlatan' and a 'killer' and demanded he explain his 'colossal blunder'. Shortly before they were thrown out of the conference, Rory muttered to his brother that Ubani was an 'animal' – something he had said he was unaware of until it was mentioned in legal documents long after the incident in 2010. Accord to the Daily Telegraph the legal fees he would be expected  runs into the thousands. 'It makes me feel physically sick, it is quite hard to believe,' Rory, who lives in Germany and works for the country's weather office, told the Daily Telegraph. 'We went to that conference because we were determined to make things safer for people - what we have done has changed the laws to make things safer across Europe. 'The General Medical Council has thanked us, the politicians have thanked us but now this. It shows the man has no integrity, no remorse.' Brother: Rory was sued for remarks he made when he and his brother Stuart (pictured), himself a GP from Worcester, confronted the doctor at a medical conference in Lindau, Bavaria . The medic was struck off by the British General Medical Council but was able to continue working in Germany. He was charged with death by negligence at a court in Witten but was let off with a nine-month suspended prison sentence and ordered him to pay costs of 5,000 euros, or £4,100. The disgraced doctor has since refused to return to the UK, and a European arrest warrant was issued by Cambridgeshire Police but could not be carried out because legal proceedings had begun in Germany. The case was almost identical to one Ubani brought against the Grays in August 2010. On that occasion his claim for compensation was thrown out and he had to pay the brothers' legal costs. The German court also ruled they could refer to him as a 'charlatan and a killer' but not describe him as an 'animal'. Ubani later lost an appeal at Munich High Court. David Gray's death in 2008 prompted a review of out-of-hours services, particularly a loophole which allowed doctors from the EU with poor English to practise here because of rules on the free movement of labour. In June new laws were introduced that allow the GMC to withhold a licence if they have concerns about an individual. The regulator wrote to the Grays congratulating them on their efforts to have the law changed. Tanja Schubert, its head of European and international affairs, said: 'We could not have achieved this without your support.'","Dr Daniel Ubani over-prescribed diamorphine to David Gray, 70 .

"From blocked drains to burnt toast, there are some smells that most of us would love to block out. Now scientists think there may be a way of stopping people smelling unpleasant aromas by creating a blend of chemical compounds that neuralise a specific pungent aroma. They have devised a mathematical model that predicts how humans perceive certain smells and think they could be blocked by creating what they describe as 'white noise for the nose'. Scientists think there may be a way of stopping people smelling unpleasant aromas (illustrated with a stock image) by creating a blend of 38 aromas to create 'white smell' While visual and audio signals are easily manipulated, because waves can be described mathematically, it is harder to use equations to describe the chemistry behind smells,New Scientist reported. But Kush Varshney of IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Centre in New York and Lav Varshney of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have managed to describe different smells using maths. The brothers have come up with a mathematical model that predicts how humans perceive the smells of certain substances based on their chemistry and physical properties. The duo did this by matching a database of chemical compounds to perceived smells, so that a compound could smell 5.8 chalky, on a scale of -5 to 10. for example. Two brothers have devised a mathematical model that predicts how humans perceive certain smells. Their research could one day lead to the creation of a smell-cancelling device, which could be used to block out a range of nasty smells from burnt toast (illustrated left) to nasty bodily whiffs (stock image right) A Norwegian study recently uncovered the process behind how the brain makes smells stick to distant memories and 'inner maps'. Researchers designed a maze for rats, where a rat would see a hole to poke its nose into. When poking into the hole, the rat was presented with one of two alternative smells. One smell told the rat that food is in the left food cup behind the rat. The other smell told it there was food in the right cup. After three weeks, the rats chose the hole with the food more than 85 per cent of the time. Electrode pairs were inserted in the brains of the rats throughout. After the associations between smell and place were established, the researchers could see a pattern of brain wave activity in these areas. They say that a smell can be cancelled out by calculating which compounds create the opposite ratings, so that a perfectly neutral score of 0 is achieved. Noam Sobel, of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel came up with the idea of ‘white smell’ – a specific blend of 30 compounds that can be compared to white noise for the nose. Now, the Varshney brothers have shown that a blend of 38 compounds can cancel pungent smells such as onion and tuna. While a smell cancelling machine has not yet been created, the pair think that their mathematical model could make it possible. They came up with the idea having been inspired by IBM’s experimental Watson computer, which is currently learning to cook by looking at which flavour compounds different foods have in common. Dr Sobel, who is working on his own smell-cancelling device, said that white smell itself is not very palatable. ‘It's not very pleasant, but it's not foul. It's not very edible smelling, but it doesn't smell poisonous,’ he said.","Brothers at IBM in New York and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  have described different smells using mathematics .

"Fears are growing for the sister of a crazed gunman who shot dead two volunteer firefighters after he lured them to their deaths by setting fire to his house on Christmas Eve. Cheryl Spengler lived with her felon brother William Spengler at the home he burned down early Monday in Webster, New York. Police say she is missing. A family friend of William Spengler says he 'couldn't stand' his sister and said the two had a difficult relationship. Police are investigating whether a fight with her sparked the shocking violence - which took place just ten days after the elementary school shootings in Newtown, Connecticut.

Burning: A bystander watches while seven homes in a street in Webster, New York, burned . William Spengler, 62, has a history of brutality against his family. In July 1980, he beat his 92-year-old grandmother Rose Spengler to death with a hammer. He served 17 years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter. He was released in 1998. Authorities believe he used an assault rifle to kill Webster police Lieutenant Mike Chiapperini, 42, and Tomasz Kaczowka, 19, a rookie 911 dispatcher who was best friends with Lt Chiapperini's son. Spengler, who shot himself dead after a brief firefight with police, is a convicted felon and cannot legally own a gun in New York. Killer: William Spengler had previously served 17 years in prison for killing his elderly grandmother . However, somehow, he was able to obtain an assault rifle - the same type of weapon that was used to murder 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14. Police say Spengler also had a handgun. Roger Vercruysse, who claims Spengler was a good friend when they lived next door in Webster, a Rochester suburb, said Spengler 'couldn't stand' his sister, Cheryl Spengler. Police have been unable to locate her since the home she shared with William Spengler was burned down. Mr Vercruysse said Spengler 'loved his mama to death.' Arline Spengler died in October, and Mr Vercruysse wonders what effect that had on her 62-year-old son. He says he thinks William Spengler 'went crazy' after she died. Police say they don't have a motive for the killings on the shore of Lake Ontario. However, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reports that detectives believe a fight between William Spengler and his sister Cheryl, whom he lived with, could have sparked the horrific violence. The victims, Lt Chiapperini and Kaczowka, were public servants who bravely volunteered to be firefighters in their off-hours. Lt Chiapperini was a community leader who was heavily involved as a volunteer firefighter and had held nearly every post at the fire house. He even trained Mr Kaczowka, who spent three years of high school training in the department's Explorer program. In addition, two full time fire men, Joseph Hofsetter and Theodore Scardino were shot and wounded by the gunman and are currently in nearby Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, along with John Ritter, an off duty police officer who was hit by shrapnel from the volley of bullets. Mr Hofsetter, who is also a full-time firefighter with the . Rochester Fire Department, was hit once in the pelvis and the bullet . lodged in his spine, authorities said. Mr Scardino was hit in the chest and . knee. All three men are in a guarded condition according to West Webster fire Chief Gerald Pickering, who confirmed that there was only one gunman and that it appears the fire was started as a trap. 'It does appear it was a trap set for first responders,' said a visibly emotional Pickering at a press conference this morning.

Joseph Hofsetter and a friend: The West Webster firefighter is currently in hospital in Rochester having been shot by the unidentified gunman . Police say Spengler set fire to a car and house to lure firefighters to his house on the shore of Lake Ontario about 5.30am. When firefighters arrived, he ambushed them and opened fire.

Monday's shooting and fires were in a neighborhood of seasonal and year-round homes set close together across the road from the lakeshore. The area is popular with recreational boaters but is normally quiet this time of year. 'We have very few calls for service in that location,' Pickering said. 'Webster is a tremendous community. We are a safe community, and to have a tragedy befall us like this is just horrendous.' O'Flynn lamented the violence, which comes on the heels of other shootings including the massacre of 20 students and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. 'It's sad to see that that this is becoming more commonplace in communities across the nation,' O'Flynn said.Webster, a middle-class suburb, now is the scene of violence linked to house fires for two Decembers in a row.

"Captain Wayne Rooney admits the hard work for England starts again now as they step up preparations for next week's opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland. Roy Hodgson's young side - with five of the starting XI under 22 - laboured through a 1-0 victory over Norway at a half-empty Wembley on Thursday night as England began life after their World Cup disaster.

'It was important to get the victory, but now we have to move on from here,' said Rooney. 'There are four days before Switzerland and hopefully we can come back from there with a positive result. 'We know we have to be better against the Swiss if we are going to get the victory there. 'We will work hard now and be ready, hopefully we can come back with a victory.'

'We understand that after the World Cup, it is difficult for everyone, the players and the fans, so we have to make sure we do well in the Euro 2016 qualification campaign to make those fans believe again and hopefully we can do that on Monday night.' Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling was man of the match against Norway. Rooney, 28, is confident all the younger members of the squad can follow his example and step up to the challenges ahead. 'If you look at the squad, you can see the players who are doing really well with their teams in the Premier League, you have Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge, Jack Wilshere and (Alex) Oxlade-Chamberlain are all doing great,' he said. 'Going to the World Cup and being part of that, feeling what they did, seeing how it was out there can only give them experience in international football for future tournaments. they will learn from that. 'We know we have a young team, but all of us have to stand up and make sure we can give ourselves a great chance of qualifying for 2016.' England were set to train at St George's Park on Thursday, with those who played some part against Norway scheduled for a warm down and the others of the squad to do some field sessions as Hodgson turn his attentions towards tackling the Swiss, whom he guided to the finals of Euro 96.

'We wanted to see how both ways of playing could operate for us because we know we have the personal to do it if we want to.

"The number of children who have died from asthma attacks in the past two years has sky-rocketed, new figures have revealed. The latest New South Wales child death review found that in the last 10 years, 20 children have died from the respiratory disease but the alarming figure is that half of those deaths occurred in the past two years. It was also found, there were more deaths in 2010, 2012 and 2013 than in previous years and more than two thirds of those children were male, twice the rate of  girls for the same period. In most cases, it's been put down to complacency, the children who died from asthma had factors that may have increased their risk of death. Scroll down for video . The latest New South Wales child death review found that in the last 10 years, 20 children have died from asthma attacks . These included sub-optimal level of asthma control, insufficient follow-up after a hospital visit, poor adherence to recommended asthma medication or action plans and exposure to tobacco smoke. Surprising figures in the past two years have seen the number of children dying from asthma attacks has increased in NSW . The report states the majority of the children had more than one risk factor, while insufficient follow up after a hospital admission was a factor for eight children who did not visit a doctor. For four children, it was unclear who in the family was overseeing the child’s asthma management. While in relation to the fatal asthma attack, in six cases there were indicators that the child or the child’s family may not have recognised early signs that asthma symptoms were slowly worsening, or may not have fully appreciated the severity of the child’s condition. NSW Asthma Foundation CEO Michele Goldman says the figures are surprising since there has been a downward trend in childhood related deaths in the last decade. 'They show asthma is not being taken seriously, some deaths could have been prevented,' she said. 'The foundation strongly advises people to take asthma more seriously, making sure children have an asthma action plan in place and preventative measures are taken regularly (because some people get caught out).' 'When the child does start to expose symptoms, something must be done within minutes.' The increase in child deaths from asthma has been put down to complacency, including sub-optimal level of asthma control, insufficient follow up after a hospital visit and lack of action plans . Ms Goldman says there is still a lack of understanding because asthma is a complex disease which impact people differently. 'To find the right medication, to find the right dose is not the simplest thing in the world but education is key,' she said. The Asthma Foundation regularly conducts survey in a bid to get a reading of how well asthma is controlled and other key issues. 'Most people thought it was well controlled but three quarters of cases are not well controlled according to our asthma test.' Australia has the highest incidence of asthma in the world, with every one in ten Australian suffering from the disease. But over the last decade there has been a significant decrease in deaths. 'There was 1000 deaths in the late 1980s and recently there's been around 400 deaths,' said Ms Goldman.

"BIG BET: Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger bet that Facebook's shares would dramatically rise after its May IPO. They were right, if only briefly . Facebook's ill-fated shareholders can take solace in the fact that they probably didn't make as big a wager on the social network's stock as the owners of Instagram. So far, the creators of the popular photo-sharing service have lost around $300 million - and with each successive dip in Facebook's shares, that amount grows even larger. Instagram was sold to Facebook in April for $1 billion. Founders Kevin . Systrom and Mike Krieger decided to take $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of Facebook's yet-to-go public's stock. At the time, Facebook stock was valued at around $30 per share. Facebook's initial public offering on May 18 valued the stock at $38 per share. At the time, Instagram's big Facebook bet looked like a masterstroke, as those 23 million shares soared in value to almost $875 million, alone. That made the total deal closer to $1.2 billion. Deal-maker: Along with Krieger, Systrom, pictured here, sold Instagram for $300 million in cash and about 23 million pre-IPO Facebook shares valued at $30 a-piece . Going Down: Since it May 18th IPO, Facebook's stock has plummeted from a high of around $42 on the first day to about $19-a-share at Tuesday's close of trading .

"Lewis Hamilton will not jeopardise his chances of winning the Spanish Grand Prix by repeating the erratic driving style he deployed at the last race in China. Hamilton, who will again start on pole position here in Barcelona, slowed down and weaved during the parade lap three weeks ago, causing the cars behind him to slam on their brakes and in some cases to stop altogether. The Mail on Sunday has learnt that race officials discussed Hamilton's strange behaviour at the time but decided not to penalise him. VIDEO Scroll down to jump on board with Hamilton around the Barcelona circuit . Job done: Lewis Hamilton secured the 35th pole position of his grand prix career in Spain on Saturday . However, the matter was brought up at the drivers' meeting on Friday evening and Hamilton apologised to his fellow racers and promised not to replicate the same antics. As long as he keeps his nose clean, Hamilton is likely to win Sunday's race after a brilliant performance in qualifying. He finished 0.168sec ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to claim his fourth pole position in five races this season. For all the talk of upgrades to the cars of rivals at the opportunity offered by the first race of the European stage of the season, Mercedes have seemingly maintained their significant advantage over the rest. On track: Mercedes driver Hamilton is bidding for his fourth straight victory this season . Nobody can live with them: Daniel Ricciardo, of Red Bull, was third fastest, a full second back from Hamilton. 'I'm very disappointed,' said Rosberg. 'I don't particularly like coming second to Lewis. I did a good lap but he did a better job.' There is a danger, implicit in what Rosberg said, that Hamilton can waltz to his second world title. He has won three of the four races, the only blip being a technical malfunction at the opening round in Melbourne. Rosberg won that race and was runner-up at the next three, meaning that he takes a four-point lead into Sunday's race in Barcelona. Hamilton has not led the standings since he did so fleetingly in 2012. Second best: Nico Rosberg will start alongside his team-mate on the front row in Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix . 'That was my one small taste of leading the championship for some time, but otherwise I don't remember the last time,' he said. 'As long as you're leading when you cross the finish line at the last race, that's what counts. But it's my goal to get in front and stay there.' Hamilton accomplished his pole position feat despite having problems with his machinery. He came on the radio to say: 'I don't know how but we've made the car worse.' He later explained: 'In practice we had such a great car and often when things are that good you don't want to change much. But we changed a few things over night in the hope of making things a little bit better – small things, like half a millimetre here and there.  'But today they car was a real handful.' Best of the rest: Daniel Ricciardo will start in third ahead of Sebastian Vettel who broke down on track . The same could be said of the world champion, Sebastian Vettel. The gearbox of his Red Bull failed, condemning him to start 10th and adding to a season of woe. How he must be irked by the performances of his team-mate Ricciardo. 'I'm quite disappointed,' said Vettel. It was a dismal day, too, for McLaren. Jenson Button was eighth fastest – impressive in the circumstances – and his rookie team-mate Kevin Magnussen 15th. The feel-good factor that came with Ron Dennis's return is dissipating. It will take time for the structural changes that are slowly evolving to take full effect.","Lewis Hamilton slowed down and weaved during the parade lap .

"Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has faced criticism for toasting champagne after signing a refugee deal with Cambodia, a country described as 'one of the poorest and most corrupt in the world'. The four-year deal, signed on Friday night with Cambodia's Interior Minister Sar Kheng, will allow Australia to send refugees currently detained on the Pacific island of Nauru to  Cambodia. Mr Morrison said it would be up to Cambodia to determine when it accepts the refugees and how many but hopes voluntary resettlement will begin later this year. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison (left) has faced criticism for toasting champagne after signing a refugee deal with one of the world's poorest and most corrupt nations . The four-year deal, signed on Friday night, with Cambodia's Interior Minister Sar Kheng (right) will allow Australia to send refugees processed on the Pacific island of Nauru to Cambodia . The memorandum of understanding has  been criticised as pointless and expensive, as Australia is required to provide support for housing, education and health as well as language training to refugees. Australia will give Cambodia $40 million in extra assistance over the next four years in return. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young described the deal as 'dirty' and a 'fundamental failure'. She said it was $40 million bribe to a corrupt government that will unleash human misery. 'On budget night we had Joe Hockey dancing, and now we have Scott Morrison popping champagne corks after signing a dirty deal with one of the most corrupt and poorest nations on Earth,' Senator Sarah Hanson-Young told reporters on Saturday. 'It's crass, it's sickening.' Mr Morrison brushed off criticism, saying the toast was standard protocol in Cambodia. 'I'm not going to disrespect my host,' Mr Morrison said. The opposition has labelled the deal a complete farce that will see only a handful of refugees resettled. 'It is no wonder Scott Morrison refused to answer questions (at the signing),' opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles said. The memorandum of understanding has been criticised as pointless and expensive, as Australia is required to provide support for housing, education and health as well as language training to refugees . Up to 1000 asylum-seekers currently on Nauru who are deemed to be genuine refugees will be given the opportunity to resettle in Cambodia . The United Nations refugee agency says it is 'deeply concerned at the precedent' and has urged Australia to reconsider. 'It's crucial that countries do not shift their refugee responsibilities elsewhere,' UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said on Friday. Amnesty International said the agreement was a 'worrying departure from international norms', Sydney Morning Herald reported. 'In January the Australian government condemned Cambodia's human rights record at a UN human rights hearing, but will now relocate vulnerable refugees, possibly including children, to the country,' said Rupert Abbott, the Deputy Asia-Pacific Director at Amnesty International. About 100 people protested outside the Australian embassy. '(Cambodia) couldn't give humanitarian support even if we wanted to ... Cambodia is poor as hell,' Ou Virak, chairman of the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights, told AP. The condemnation comes just after the federal government confirmed that a 15-year-old asylum seeker girl who allegedly attempted self-harm was evacuated to Australia from Nauru detention centre. Mr Morrison was reportedly 20 minutes late to Friday's ceremony that saw Australia's Immigration Minister and Minister Sar Kheng toast to their deal, The Age reports. In a statement, Mr Morrison said 'a number of those found to be in genuine need of protection will now have the opportunity and support to re-establish their lives free from persecution'. Cambodian officials have said they might only start off with five refugees, but Mr Morrison downplayed such reports saying Phnom Penh had made a 'very strong commitment'. 'What Cambodia is saying, and we agree with them, is that you have to start off small, make sure the program is working, and then build it up over time,' he told the ABC on Saturday. In Australia, about 70 protesters chanting 'free the refugees' and 'freedom, azadi' gathered along the perimeter fence of the Brisbane Immigration Transit Centre at Pinkenba.

"Nasa has revealed the design chosen for its next generation spacesuits by a public vote - and a sci-fi inspired 'Tron' design has won. This design now will be incorporated into the final version of the suit, which is expected to be ready for testing by November 2014. Each iteration of the suit will test new technologies that one day will be used in a suit worn by the first humans to step foot on the Red Planet. Scroll down for video . The new design will now be incorporated into the final version of the suit, which is expected to be ready for testing by November 2014. Each iteration of the suit will test new technologies that one day will be used in a suit worn by the first humans to step foot on the Red Planet. The public was given three choices of suit design: . The Biomimicry suit was inspired by the . ocean and has been designed to mirror ‘the bioluminescent qualities of . aquatic creatures found at incredible depths, and the scaly skin of fish . and reptiles found across the globe.’ The Technology suit ‘pays homage to spacesuit achievements of the past while incorporating subtle elements of the future’. It . is fitted with Luminex wire and patches that emit light to make it . easier to identify crew members during spacewalks, for example. The Trends in Society suit is ‘reflective of what every day clothes may look like in the not too distant future.’ It uses electroluminescent wire and a bright colour scheme to mimic the look of sportswear and wearable tech. With 233,431 votes, the 'Technology' option has won NASA's Z-2 Spacesuit design challenge with just over 63% of the total vote. Nasa’s Z-2 is the latest prototype in the agency’s Z range of spacesuits, and will be the successor to the its green and white Z-1 model unveiled in 2012. The Technology suit, the eventual winner, ‘pays homage to spacesuit achievements of the past while incorporating subtle elements of the future’. It is fitted with Luminex wire, and patches that emit light to make it easier to identify crew members during spacewalks, for examples. These patches are fitted to the upper and lower torso, alongside collapsing pleats that make movement easier. It also has abrasion resistant panels on the lower torso. The public was given a choice tof three designs. The Biomimicry suit was inspired by the ocean and has been designed to mirror ‘the bioluminescent qualities of aquatic creatures found at incredible depths, and the scaly skin of fish and reptiles found across the globe.’ Nasa said the design reflects the qualities that protect some of 'Earth's toughest creatures', and specifically includes segmented pleats at the shoulder, elbow, hip and knee. It also features electroluminescent wire across the upper torso, which lights up in the dark. Jeff Bridges in Tron:Legacy, the film believed to have inspired the design . The Technology model of the suit, pictured left, ‘pays homage to spacesuit achievements of the past while incorporating subtle elements of the future.' It is fitted with Luminex wire and patches that emit light to make it easier to identify crew members during spacewalks, for example . Besides the typical fit checks and mobility evaluations, NASA currently is planning a very comprehensive test campaign for the Z-2 suit. Engineers will conduct multiple vacuum chamber tests, including one series at full vacuum, mimicking the lack of atmosphere found in space. The suit will be tested at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, the huge indoor pool used to train astronauts to spacewalk. Further testing at a site at Johnson that imitates the rocky Martian surface  will help evaluate the suit's mobility, comfort and performance. Ultimately, all of these tests will guide engineers in designing the Z-3. With the Z-2, NASA will employ cover layer design elements, like electroluminescent wiring, never used before in a spacesuit. Meanwhile, the Trends in Society suit is ‘reflective of what every day clothes may look like in the not too distant future.’ It uses electroluminescent wire and a bright colour scheme to mimic the look of sportswear and wearable tech. The design includes pleats with contrast stitching, plus electroluminescent wire and patches of varying styles across both the upper and lower torso. The Z-2 will be made using 3D printed . parts, while 3D human laser scans will be used to accurately size each . suit to individual astronauts. In a . blog post, Nasa said: ‘As spacesuit engineers, [we] have found . ourselves with an exciting opportunity: the chance to make a suit with a . look unlike any suit ever built before. ‘The designs were created with the intent to protect the suit and to highlight certain mobility features to aid suit testing. ‘To take it a step further, we are leaving it up you, the public, to choose which of three candidates will be built.’ The Z-2, Technology prototype pictured, will be made using 3D printed parts, while 3D human laser scans will be used to accurately size each suit to the astronaut.

Technically, the Z-2 will be built to withstand and absorb impact, especially on the upper and lower torso. Despite claims it looked like a toy suit, Nasa’s Z-1 suit was named one of Time Magazine's Best Inventions of 2012. ‘After the positive response to the Z-1 suit's visual design we received, we wanted to take the opportunity to provide this new suit with an equally memorable appearance,’ continued Nasa. ‘The cover layer of a prototype suit is important as it serves to protect the suit against abrasion and snags during the rigors of testing. ‘With the Z-2, we're looking forward to employing cover layer design elements never used in a spacesuit before. ‘ .

"A teenage entrepreneur who scooped a £80,000 investment on Dragon's Den has been arrested on suspicion of burgling his mother's house. Jordan Daykin, 19, became the youngest person to ever go into business with the Dragons when Deborah Meaden pledged the money in return for a 25 per cent stake in his  business. But just two months later he was arrested after his mother claimed he ransacked her house and stole a number of valuables including, Swarovski crystals, four televisions and jewellery worth £4,000. Claims: Jordan Daykin, pictured right on Dragons' Den earlier this year, is alleged to have stolen from the home of his mother Maria Daykin, right, in Westbury, Kent. He was arrested and later released on bail . Permission: Jordan's spokesman said that he was allowed to enter the home and that his mother had recently experienced 'a sudden upheaval at home'. Above, one of the rooms that Ms Daykin claimed was burgled . A spokesman for Jordan said that he had permission from his mother to enter the house and that he was simply helping his brother leave home after a row. He added that the belongings they took belonged to them. Mother-of-two Maria Daykin, 45, said she was 'disgusted' by her son's alleged actions, which are said to be part of a family feud. She said: 'I had to phone the police because it is a violation of my privacy. When I got home I found my house had just been completely trashed, every bit of furniture, the TVs off the wall, everything. 'He has been nominated for all these awards. I think the only motive was for me to walk in and see my house destroyed.' She claims to have lost all the furniture from two bedrooms, around 100 DVDs and perfume worth nearly £300. 'Family feud': The teenager's spokesman said Jordan was was simply helping his brother leave the home in Westbury, Wiltshire, pictured, after a row. He claims that they removed some of their possessions . 'Disgusted': Ms Daykin claims Jordan and three others planned the raid for when she was out the house. Above, the mess Ms Daykin said was left in her garage (left) after the alleged burglary, and an empty bedroom . 'Violation': Ms Daykin said that she returned home to find that her house, pictured, had been ransacked and claims that items including two beds, four televisions and jewellery worth £4,000 had been stolen. Ms Daykin, from Westbury, Wiltshire, said the incident happened on October 9 and that her son was swiftly arrested later that evening by Wiltshire Police. She claims Jordan and three others planned the raid for when she was out the house. He was arrested and kept overnight and was released on bail after extensive questioning. Record-breaking: Jordan Daykin became the youngest entrepreneur to secure an investment on Dragons' Den when Deborah Meaden, pictured, pledged £80,000 for a share in his company . The teenager's spokesman said Jordan was simply helping his brother leave home after a row. He said: 'Some of his brother's possessions were removed and some of Jordan's.' He said that his mother had given her permission and added: 'She's had a sudden upheaval at home. Jordan's sensitive to her emotional state.' Last week Jordan was short-listed as Young Entrepreneur of the Year in the GB Entrepreneur Awards. In August he was handed £80,000 from Dragon Deborah Meaden after she took an interest in his company Grip It Fixings, which offers a universal fixing, designed for use with all types of plasterboard. The investment will help Jordan with the costs of new machinery, stock increase and a deposit for their warehouse in Melksham, Somerset. Jordan left school at the age of 13 and his first business was a website called RS2Services, inspired by his love of RuneScape, an online fantasy role-playing game. The site offered players the best RuneScape products at a cheaper price. He later founded nationwide tutoring agency Tutor Magnet, which currently has a database of over 400 tutors and generates a turnover of £2,000 a month. Jordan came up with the idea for Grip It Fixings in 2008 while putting up curtain rails with his then 74-year-old grandfather Stan. A Spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'We can confirm a man aged 19 was arrested on October 9 at approximately 7pm on suspicion of burglary and was taken to Melksham Police Station. 'He has been bailed pending further enquiries.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Jordan Daykin became youngest person to secure Dragons' Den investment .

"Police hunting for the gunman accused of shooting dead a corporal at state barracks 29 days ago hope the fall will break his cover. Since September 12, Eric Frein has evaded 300 troopers, sniffer dogs, helicopters and citizen watch teams after fleeing through the woods of Pennsylvania's dense Pocono Mountain range. And a shocking new report reveals the large-scale operation is costing agencies more than $1.1 million a week. But now that it's getting colder and the leaves are starting to fall, the advantage could soon shift to law enforcement, experts say. Hopes: Lt Col George Bivens hopes the change of weather will give them an advantage over Eric Frein (left) However, officials insist the challenge remains no less daunting as police track an armed suspect - already accused of killing one officer and injuring another - in a wilderness that offers plenty of places to hide. 'I wish people could understand how hard it is to find people in the woods,' said Patrick Patten, who helped track Eric Rudolph, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bomber who eluded authorities for years in the woods of western North Carolina. 'It truly is a massive undertaking.' The September 12 ambush outside the Blooming Grove state police barracks killed Cpl. Bryon Dickson, seriously wounded Trooper Alex Douglass and touched off a manhunt whose scale and intensity is unrivaled in modern Pennsylvania history. Day after day, tactical teams looking for Frein creep through the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis, using sticks and ski poles to prod the dense underbrush. Dogs sniff for explosives, weapons and ammunition - and any sign of the suspect. Troopers maintain a perimeter. Search: 300 armed troopers have been searching Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains since September 12 . Drastic: The intensity of the manhunt is unrivaled in the state's history as Frein is armed and trained . Pulled out all the stops: Sniffer dogs and helicopters were among the many measures brought in to find him . A month after the attack, residents have grown accustomed to the constant police presence in this rugged corner of the state. A woman fetching her mail seemed unfazed last week as more than a dozen camouflaged officers surrounded a vacant home across the street. She walked back up her driveway without so much as a glance. Others are more unnerved. Vonya Galunic, 35, said the sight of tactical teams in the woods behind her house, or along the creek where she often spends time, is upsetting. 'This is where I go for my solitude,' said Galunic, who grew up here but lives part-time in New York City. Spreading mulch along her driveway as black-clad, heavily armed state police rendezvoused next door, she said: 'It's really uncomfortable. What do you do?' The massive manhunt has upset daily life in other ways, with schools closed and whole neighborhoods blocked off in the early days of the search, and retail businesses still foundering. An upcoming Halloween parade has been postponed and trick-or-treating this year is canceled. State police Lt. Col. George Bivens acknowledged the manhunt's toll. Dangerous: Police claim they have spied Frein from a distance but not been able to catch him . 'I know this has been a very trying time for everyone, and I can only imagine the stress this is putting on families caught in the middle,' he said. Yet most residents remain supportive, Bivens said, citing the blue ribbons that adorn mailboxes and tree trunks, the letters from schoolchildren and Scouts, and the handshakes offered up by civilians. At Lewis' Supermarket, near the search area, a fundraiser for the victims' families sold more than 300 'PSP Strong' T-shirts in just a few hours last week. 'There's a lot of support in the community for the police to catch his guy,' said Eric Roeder, 53, who bought one of the $15 shirts. 'I live next to the woods and he could be running around my house.' At times, law enforcement has seemed tantalizingly close to Frein, the 31-year-old self-taught survivalist, war re-enactor and expert marksman believed to harbor a hatred of law enforcement. Police were able to determine Frein's direction of travel from a campsite he had used and say they've even laid eyes on him - from a distance. But he has proven to be elusive, and the dense forest canopy has allowed him to avoid the prying eyes of police helicopters outfitted with thermal imaging cameras. Tragic: He is accused of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson (left) and seriously wounding Trooper Alex Douglass (right) That could change once the trees are bare, giving the cameras a better shot at detecting him, said Patten, the tracking expert. Yet the lack of foliage could also work in Frein's favor, he said, allowing him to see law enforcement from a greater distance and potentially putting officers in more danger. 'Whatever works for the good guys, works for the bad guys, and whatever works for him works for us,' said Patten, founder of Tactical Woodland Operations School in North Carolina. At one point during the long, frustrating search for Rudolph, Patten walked 600 miles in a single 10-month span but found no sign of his quarry. Similarly, it's not clear that authorities in the Frein manhunt have any idea where he is hiding within the 5-square-mile area they are targeting. 'Not being there, I can't criticize what they are doing,' said Larry Wilkinson, president of Tactical Tracker Training School in North Carolina. But the evidence suggests 'they are still shooting the dark,' he said. 'If you have guys in the woods and guys around a house' several miles away, 'they have no idea where he is.'","Eric Frein has evaded 300 troopers since barracks attack on September 12 .

"Self-confessed ‘party boy’ Solomon Akhtar, 22, from London allegedly filmed himself with an ex-girlfriend . The Apprentice has become embroiled in fresh controversy after it emerged one of the contestants allegedly made a sex tape which show bosses fear could be leaked to the public. Self-confessed ‘party boy’ Solomon Akhtar allegedly filmed himself with an ex-girlfriend and was forced to confess to BBC bosses after his friends posted the information on Twitter. It is the latest in a string of controversies for this year’s show, which is fronted by Sir Alan Sugar, after it was revealed that fellow contestant James Hill, 27, is a convicted thug who bit a man’s ear. BBC bosses are said to be ‘concerned’ Mr Akhtar’s sex tape will leak while the tenth series of the show is on air. News of the video first surfaced after a friend of the technology entrepreneur from London posted news of it on Twitter with the caption: ‘revelation of the day’. It was later deleted. Friends of the 22-year-old have reportedly told The Sun the sordid tape is one of many, prompting fears other former girlfriends may come out of the woodwork and sell their stories. According to the newspaper, a show insider said: 'This is a concern for Solomon and the BBC. 'Both are hoping his conquests keep quiet. 'He is still on good terms with his ex, so while she has obviously told friends about the tape, fingers are crossed that she won't leak it. 'But there are no guarantees that she, or any other former flames, won't come out of the woodwork and reveal what he's been up to.' Mr Akhtar, who has confessed on the show to enjoying a party lifestyle, runs his own social media technology business and works at a creative agency. In his profile for the show, he described himself as ‘enthusiastic, energetic, personable and passionate about technology and travel.’ 'I am from the “ideas generation”; because of my age, I understand technology and how to turn it into a business,' he said. He has also claimed his biggest life regret is 'spending too much time and hard-earned money at university on partying.' The revelation is the latest controversy to hit the BBC1 show. Scroll down for video . Mr Akhtar (pictured left in the boardroom with Scott McCulloch and Daniel Lassman) has admitted enjoying a party lifestyle and claims his biggest life regret is 'spending too much time and money at university on partying' Contestants James Hill, 27, (left) and Lauren Riley, 28, (right) allegedly had a 'full-on fling' during filming . Details of Mr Hill’s conviction left show bosses red-faced after it was revealed that he beat up a bus driver who was talking to his girlfriend and hit him with 'punch after punch' in the unprovoked attack. The victim was left scarred for life. While Mr Hill, who started out in business washing cars and now runs several businesses including selling vending machines and running his own bar and restaurant, waited for the court case into the incident, he attacked again. Just months after the first attack, he was arrested for biting a man's ear on Christmas Eve 2008. He appeared at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court in March 2009, where he was charged under his full name of Anthony James Hill and admitted two counts of assault. In July that year he was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended, ordered to pay his victims £300 and £200 respectively, and told to pay £755 costs. Mr Hill, from Chesterfield (pictured on the BBC show), was convicted in 2009 of two attacks in which he bit a man's ear and left the other scarred for life. He has since said he 'very much' regrets the unprovoked incidents . The popular BBC1 show, which is fronted by Sir Alan Sugar (pictured), is currently in its tenth series . After details of his conviction emerged, the contestant came out and said he was ‘not proud’ of the attacks and ‘very much’ regrets them. However, it didn’t stop him allegedly sparking up a relationship with fellow contestant Lauren Riley, 28, during filming for the show. They allegedly had a 'full-on fling' while competing for the £250,000 top prize. Representatives for The Apprentice declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.","Contestant Solomon Akhtar, 22, allegedly filmed himself with an ex-girlfriend .

"Ailing phone group BlackBerry bought a private jet worth over $20 million just months before it laid off 4,500 workers and  reported a nearly $1 billion second-quarter loss, it was revealed on Sunday. Ill-timed executives had the second-hand Bombardier Global Express delivered in July and explained the decision as a cost-cutting exercise as the plane replaced two older aircraft. But perhaps after a closer look at their accounts, the company announced on Sunday it will now sell the latest addition to their fleet and will no longer own any private jets. Ill-timed: Blackberry bought a Bombardier Global private jet (as seen in this file photo), just months before the phone company sacked thousands and reported huge losses . 'Several years ago, the company bought two medium-range Dassault aircraft,' BlackBerry said in a statement reported by the Financial Times. 'Earlier . this year the company decided to sell both planes and replace them with . one longer-range aircraft. The company considered several options and . selected a used Bombardier aircraft, which was eventually delivered in . July,' it continued. This . ultra long-range jet can fly between Tokyo and New York without . refueling. A used aircraft will typically cost between $20 - $30 million. Blackberry . said on Friday that it will lay off thousands of employees, or 40 per . cent of its global workforce, as it reported a nearly $1 billion . second-quarter loss a week earlier than expected. Plush: The interior of a Bombardier Global Express XRS business jet looks comfortable and the plane can travel between New York and Tokyo without refueling. But Blackberry fired 4,500 employees on Friday . The stock dropped 23 per cent to $8.11 after reopening for trading. Shares had been halted earlier pending the news announced the same day rival Apple's latest iPhone models went on sale. Sunday's statement on the private jet purchase added: 'In light of the company’s current . business condition, the company has decided to sell that aircraft along . with the two legacy aircraft and will no longer own any planes.' BlackBerry had been scheduled to release earnings this week. Bombardier Global Express 5000 specs:  Crew: Two - ThreeCapacity: 8 in a typical configuration, up to 19 in high density arrangementLength: 96.8 ft (29.5 m)Wingspan: 94 ft 0 in (28.65 m)Height: 25.5 ft (7.7 m)Powerplant: 2 × Rolls-Royce BR710A2-20 turbofansCabin length: 42.47 f (12.94 m)Cabin width (centerline): 8.17 ft (2.49 m)Cabin height: 6.25 ft (1.91 m)Maximum speed: Mach .89 (513 kt, 590 mph, 950 km/h)Cruise speed: Mach .85 (488 kt, 562 mph, 904 km/h)Range: 5,200 nm (9,360 km)Data from Bombardier . But the Canadian company said late Friday afternoon that it expects to post a staggering loss of $950 million to $995 million for the quarter, including a massive write down of the value of its inventory due to increasing competition. Revenue of $1.6 billion is only about half of the $3 billion that analysts expected, according to FactSet. The . company's expected adjusted loss of 47 cents to 51 cents per share . falls far below the loss of 16 cents per share projected by Wall Street. BlackBerry . said it wants to slash operating costs in half by the first quarter of . 2015 so cutting its global headcount to 7,000 total employees is . necessary. 'We are . implementing the difficult, but necessary operational changes announced . today to address our position in a maturing and more competitive . industry, and to drive the company toward profitability.' Thorsten . Heins, President and CEO of BlackBerry, said in a statement. The . BlackBerry, pioneered in 1999, was the dominant smartphone for . on-the-go business people and other customers before Apple debuted the . iPhone in 2007. Axed: Blackberry President and CEO Thorsten Heins, pictured, attempted to boost the Canadian firm's poor sales over the past year through a series of releases, including the Q10, pictured. But it wasn't enough. Since then, BlackBerry Ltd. has been hammered by competition from the iPhone as well as Android-based rivals like Samsung. The iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C, Apple's latest and greatest, went on sale earlier Friday, flying off shelves at a record pace. Since 2007, BlackBerry has lost 93 per cent of its market share, with half going in the past year alone . Marked . by the usual lines around the block and triumphant Apple fans walking . out of Apple Stores to cheers, the new models received rave reviews from . consumers and media alike. The most-hyped new feature on the 5S is a new fingerprint sensor used to unlock the phone, making passwords and finger swipes 'a waste of time.' It also comes with an improved camera and a faster processor. It has sold out around the world, say reports. In January, Blackberry unveiled new phones running a revamped operating system called BlackBerry 10. The Z10 and Q10 were designed to better compete for customers and rejuvenate the brand. But vendor marketing was uneven and BlackBerry's market share continues to lag its rivals. BlackBerry said last month that it would consider selling itself. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company reiterated Friday that a special committee of its board of directors continues to evaluate all options. It also seemed to say that it would shift its focus back to competing mainly for the business customers most loyal to its brand. 'Going forward, we plan to refocus our . offering on our end-to-end solution of hardware, software and services . for enterprises and the productive, professional end user,' said Heins. 'This . puts us squarely on target with the customers that helped build . BlackBerry into the leading brand today for enterprise security, . manageability and reliability.' Not an iPhone killer: New Blackberry models have failed to impress ever-more choosy consumers flocking to Apple and Android devices . A stark contrast to the hype surrounding every iPhone launch, Blackberry's last new model dropped with a thud. Despite a massive advertising push and aggressive in-store sales tactics, the Z10 fell flat - despite rave reviews from the tech press. Blackberry's once leading market share has been eroded by both Apple and Samsung. Though there haven't been many lines for Samsung products, the South Korean electronics giant sells more smartphones than any other phone manufacturer - android or otherwise.","BlackBerry lost almost $1billion last quarter .

"Former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser has spoken of his political rival Gough Whitlam in the wake of his death on Tuesday morning at the age of 98. Mr Fraser said his predecessor Mr Whitlam carried neither sadness nor bitterness in his heart. Despite their political differences Mr Fraser came to value his friendship in the years after the Whitlam government was dismissed by Governor-General John Kerr in 1975, leaving the coalition to take over. Scroll down for video . Former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser (left)  has paid tribute to his predecessor Gough Whiltlam (right) in the wake of his death . 'He was far too big a man to carry any bitterness or sadness in his heart,' Mr Fraser told ABC radio on Tuesday. 'While Gough turned his antagonism, if you like, on certain people he never seemed to me to bear any personal animosity. 'We met occasionally at international forums and little by little the ice seemed to break between us and we did establish a rapport, I suppose, friendship.' Mr Fraser said Australia today was a much richer place in the wake of Mr Whitlam, whose government abolished the last remnants of the White Australia Policy, established relations with China, recognised Indigenous land rights and created Medibank. 'He was enormously, I believe, proud of Australia and the role Australia could play in the world,' Mr Fraser told ABC radio. Mr Fraser (right) said Australia today was a much richer place thanks to Mr Whitlam, and described his former political rival as someone who touched the hearts and minds of many Australians . 'He wanted this to be an independent country, not subject to anyone else or to any other country. 'He had aspirations probably too large for our immediate resources but aspirations that I think touched the hearts and minds of a great many Australians. 'He certainly left an indelible mark on Australian history.' Mr Fraser also spoke to Sky News later on Tuesday morning, to pay tribute to the 'quick-witted and able' man whose 'policies touched people one way or another'. 'He was only in power a short time but he changed the labor party in dramatic way', Mr Fraser said. 'He had a vision of Australia as an independent country.' The former Liberal prime minister also spoke of how Mr Whitlam 'opened the door' to relations with China before America, and how respected how much was attempted by his government in a short space of time. 'He will certainly go down in history as one of the most significant people in Australian public life', Mr Fraser said. 'Gough's legacy is going to be remembered as a high point in Australian life forever.' In a press conference, Mr Fraser reiterated his affection for his former political rival and paid tribute to his tenacity as a leader. 'I'll remember Gough as having a sense of Australian identity, a sense of Australia's purpose as a nation not as an appendage to other nations.' Describing him as 'large, larger than life' Mr Fraser said Mr Whitlam was a family man who loved his late wife Margaret and children dearly. When asked what politicians today could learn from his era, Mr Fraser made a strong point of the importance of maintaining Australia's independence. 'Australia should be Australia, we are not a plaything for another country'. 'We stand for what we believe not for something someone else tells us to believe,' Mr Fraser said, adding he believes it's something the country has lost over the year.

"Singer hinted his personal issues and insecurities played a big part in breakdown of marriage . Said everyone goes through 'challenges' in their lives 'whether it’s love . or money, kids, or illness' Chris Martin has spoken about how his personal issues played a part in his marital split from Gwyneth Paltrow. In a revealing interview with BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe, the Coldplay frontman gave the first real insight into troubles within his ten-year marriage to the actress. 'About two years ago I was a mess really . because I can't enjoy the thing that we are good at and I can't enjoy . the great things around me because I'm burdened by this,' the 38-year old said. 'I've got to . not blame anyone else and make some changes.' Scroll down for video . Ready to talk: Coldplay frontman Chris Martin - seen outside his hotel in Germany on Saturday - has spoken about his split from Gwyneth Paltrow in a new interview . Brave face: Gwyneth Paltrow showed off her slim pins in patterned shorts as she posed with Paris Photo Director Julien Frydman at his exhibition on Sunday . He continued: 'I wouldn’t use the word breakdown, this was . more a realisation about trying to grow up basically. 'If you can’t open yourself up, you can’t appreciate the wonder . inside. So you can be with someone very wonderful, but because of your . own issues you cannot let that be celebrated in the right way. 'What . changed for me was - I don’t want to go through life being scared of . it, being scared of love, being scared of rejection, being scared of . failure.' Moving on: Gwyneth was spotted stepping into her car after apparently getting her chakras balanced in Los Angeles on Friday . It's getting real: Removal men were seen at the London home of Gywneth and Chris earlier this week . Chris appeared to be shouldering the blame for how the couple's troubles began. He said: 'Up to a . certain point in my life I wasn’t completely vulnerable and it caused . some problems.' He . added: 'If you don’t let love really in then you can’t really give it . back. 'So what Ghost Story means to me is like you’ve got to open . yourself up to love and if you really do, of course it will be painful . at times, but then it will be great at some point. ' Happier times: The musician spoke exclusively to BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe about how the 'breakdown' of his ten-year-marriage inspired his new album, Ghost Stories . The . musician took part in an hour long interview, which will air on Monday . evening, and while he did not mention his estranged wife by name, he . spoke about candidly about his love and life. Chris mused: 'I think in life everyone needs to be broken in some way. 'I . think everyone in their life goes through challenges, whether it’s love . or money, kids, or illness... You have to really not run away from that . stuff. 'Life . throws these colorful challenges at you … what we decided to do on . Ghost Stories was to really be honest about it and say, this is what’s . been happening.' Hard to love: Chris revealed that his inability to let in love has caused problems in his life . Speaking about his new single Magic, Chris explained: 'It’s about saying this person is really awesome and is magic, and of course certain parts of it have to change because that’s life but not everything has to be black or white or clear cut and that’s okay. 'It’s not a question of you either really love someone or you really hate someone, its more nuanced than that - especially with the modern world’s complications – like travelling and all the stuff that come to life, and illness and addiction and all that sort of thing. While the video sees Chris saving a damsel from an unhappy relationship, Chris said: 'It’s just saying - ultimately there is magic between two people no matter what anyone else thinks.' The couple, who were considered one of Hollywood's most solid partnerships, stunned the showbiz world when they confirmed their split less than two months ago on March 25. Conscious uncoupling: Gwyneth and Chris are parents to Apple, eight, and Moses, six . The interview also saw Chris reveal his admiration for pop boyband One Direction. Chris admitted: 'I think One Direction are the biggest band in the world, their songs are great. 'I’m saying One Direction are brilliant and I’m not kidding. You know why? Because their songs are really good and I don’t think that any of them are going to go solo. I think they appreciate their chemistry from watching their movie. He spoke candidly about his appreciation of Harry Styles as he added: 'Harry has come to a couple of our shows, I think I probably said the same thing about chemistry. 'I can’t remember - I was too enamored with his hair cut.  I was like this: ‘I was pretty sure I was a straight guy before’ - I was having a hot flush.' He also shared his admiration for Kanye West. 'That . guy is amazing and I think he is misunderstood by people who only look . on the surface. I understand what he is talking about and I understand . what he means.'

"Roy Hodgson has unveiled his 23-man squad to bid for World Cup glory when the Three Lions jet out to Brazil later this summer. Hodgson confirmed he will be taking a side packed with young talent as England bid to end their 48-year wait for a second world title. One notable absentee is Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick, less than two years after he was tempted out of international retirement by the England manager. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luke Shaw is going to Brazil! THe boss: Roy Hodgson has named his 23 man squad for the World Cup in Brazil . Star man: Wayne Rooney is one of the key strikers in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad . Carrick is a big-name casualty as . Hodgson proved his determination to include young midfielders Ross . Barkley, Jordan Henderson and Jack Wilshere in the 23-man squad. Hodgson . also revealed Everton youngster John Stones will come into the squad if . Phil Jones' shoulder injury does not heal in time. Ashley Cole and Jermain Defoe (with 162 caps between them) are the other most senior internationals jettisoned. Rickie Lambert, who has scored 14 goals this season, gets the nod ahead of Andy Carroll. Former Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe, who now plays for Toronto FC, is only good enough for a place on the standby list. Carrick rejected the chance to be on the standby list for Euro 2012, but he has accepted the same position this time around. No-go: Michael Carrick has missed out on a chance of being in the England midfield in Brazil . Hart, Forster, Forster, Baines, Cahill, Jagielka, Johnson, Jones, Shaw, Smalling, Barkley, Gerrard, Henderson, Lallana, Lampard, Milner, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sterling, Wilshere, Lambert, Rooney, Sturridge, Welbeck . Standby: Ruddy, Cleverley, Flanagan, Carroll, Stones, Defoe, Carrick . Carrick is joined in Hodgson's . contingency planning by Tom Cleverley, who has not made the 23 despite . starting nine consecutive games under Hodgson at the start of the . 2012-13 season. Hodgson has selected just four strikers for the tournament in Brazil, which kicks off on June 12. Wayne Rooney will be the leading . striker, with Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck and Lambert in support. Frank Lampard, 35, makes the cut, but otherwise there is a youthful look . about England's midfield selection. Ross Barkley, 20, has been selected, alongside Liverpool teenager Raheem Sterling.Arsenal duo Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere are in the 23 despite their recent injury concerns. Young Lions: Raheem Sterling is one of several young players included in England's charge for Brazil . Different ball game: Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley played a round of golf after being named on England's stand-by list for the World Cup . Adam Lallana, who has three caps, has been rewarded for a fine year with Southampton by being included. James . Milner also is favoured ahead of the likes of Adam Johnson and Ashley . Young - neither of whom made the squad or standby list. There were no surprises in defence. Gary Cahill, Phil Jagielka, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling were Hodgson's four centre-halves. Leighton . Baines goes to Brazil as first-choice left-back, with Shaw in reserve. Glen Johnson goes to the tournament as England's only recognised . right-back. Hodgson selected . Fraser Forster as third goalkeeper behind Joe Hart and Ben Foster. There was a place on the standby list for Everton teenager John Stones, . who only made his first Premier League start in January. Impressed: Adam Lallana capped off a brilliant season by being named in England's squad for Brazil . Uncapped Liverpool right-back Jon Flanagan was also on the standby list. Those standby players will fly to Portugal with the squad next Monday for a week-long training camp. Hodgson admitted the decision to leave out Cole was 'an unbelievably hard' call. 'Ashley is a player that I and the rest of my staff appreciate,' he said. 'He is a magnificent player and what he's done for England is second to none. Luke Shaw has had a wonderful season. He has captured headlines with his form and ability. 'One player has 107 caps and one has many caps to come. It was a hard job to ring Ashley and I can only be unbelievably grateful for the gracious way he accepted the decision. 'Circumstances will prove whether the decision to take the younger player was the right one or not.' For . Carrick, it is a miserable end to a disastrous season at Old Trafford . and another unsatisfactory episode in a haphazard England career of 31 . appearances in 13 years. It . began with a debut against Mexico in 2001 at the age of 19 and his last . cap was as a starter against Poland in the final World Cup qualifier in . October. Back in action: Jack Wilshere has been named despite a lengthy spell out with injury . Golden chance: Rickie Lambert caps off a fantastic season for Southampton by beating Andy Carroll . There has been only . one taste of action in a major tournament, when Sven Goran Eriksson . selected him against Ecuador in Germany 2006. Nine . of his caps have been awarded by Hodgson, since he was lured out of . retirement in 2012. Like Cole, his experience and reliability has proved . valuable to England during the campaign for Brazil. He . played in the six of the qualifiers, but Hodgson has shown a glimpse of . his ruthlessness by casting them both aside as he moves the team into . the next phase. Confusion . reigned as Carrick was left out two years ago. Having officially retired . from international football under Fabio Capello, Hodgson assumed that . was that. ‘I was given to . believe he didn’t want to be part of the England set-up,’ said Hodgson, . but it turned out he did want to play and had unfinished business with . England. Young gun: Saints starlet Luke Shaw has been picked ahead of Ashley Cole . After a terrific . 2011-12 season with his club, the United midfielder came back for the . friendly against Italy in Switzerland, amid a national debate about how . to value ball possession, which followed the exit in Kiev orchestrated . by Italian pass-master Andrea Pirlo. In . the heat of a World Cup, which will start for England in the jungle . city of Manaus, Carrick might have expected this to be the perfect . moment for his calming qualities, but events at United have not helped. Nor has the development of young midfield players. A . year ago, Carrick started the summer friendlies in the absence of . Steven Gerrard against the Republic of Ireland at Wembley and Brazil in . Rio, and deep midfield was one of the areas where Hodgson considered his . options to be thin. Wilshere . was struggling for fitness – as he still is - and Barkley had yet to . emerge as a force at Premier League level. Henderson, too, has . progressed beyond expectations in the last 12 months. World at his feet: Everton starlet Ross Barkley could be one of England's wild cards in Brazil . Without . Carrick, however, there is no natural replacement for Gerrard as the . midfield anchorman if the captain is lost to injury or suspension during . the tournament. Gareth . Barry is another with the required defensive instinct, able to deputise . in the holding role but he has never been recalled by Hodgson since he . was injured in Norway, in a warm-up friendly against of Euro 2012. Frank . Lampard has played the holding role at times for Chelsea but has not . made the conversion as completely as Gerrard. The ever-versatile James . Milner and Phil Jones could be adapted, but if there is a bare patch in . the squad it is here. It . appears to have been boiled down to a straight choice between West Ham . Academy graduates Lampard and Carrick to supply midfield experience; . Carrick’s stability and ball retention versus Lampard’s goal knack and . general good influence around the camp. Not for the first time Carrick is England’s fall-guy.","Luke Shaw picked ahead of Ashley Cole .

"Just when Bali-bound Australians didn't think it could be possible to get a cheaper holiday - Indonesia is considering lifting its $US35 tourist visa fee on arrival from next year.

Aussies may be able to visit Bali for free from now . The $US35 fee could be scrapped for citizens of Australia, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia from next year, Tourism Minister Arief Yahya says.

'Like China, its middle-class is huge and that has potential for us.' The free short-term visas for Indonesia's five main tourist markets was one idea to come out of a ministerial meeting on Wednesday. Another option was simplifying licenses to encourage more yachts and cruise ships to stop over in Indonesia.

"Liverpool striker Fabio Borini says they have 10 days to get their season back on track. Last season’s title pretenders have had a poor season so far with new recruits struggling to gel and the injury to Daniel Sturridge proving more damaging than expected. But Borini, who figured in recent defeats by Real Madrid and Chelsea, believes the international break can help Liverpool put right their wrongs ahead of a visit to Crystal Palace on November 23, the site where their title challenge ended last season.

Steven Gerrard consoles a tearful Luis Suarez at Selhurst Park last year as Liverpool's title dream ended . Borini, who remains a January target for Inter Milan and Sunderland, said: ‘The feeling here is that we have 10 days to work hard and focus on ourselves. ‘We can work hard on what we need to do to improve and take that into the game against Crystal Palace and then Ludogorets. ‘We’ve got to focus on the positives and return to winning ways. We need to find confidence and belief, focus on us first and be really concentrated on what we do. We need to just pass all the rest because that’s how you perform well. Talking to Liverpoolfc.com, he added: ‘We played better [against Chelsea] than we had in the previous league games. But to lose 2-1 is obviously a disappointment. We can’t be happy about a loss in the league, especially against one of the contenders for the league and one of our rivals. ‘But there are positives - the way we played and the way we started the game, which was a lot better than what we did in the games before that.

Now it’s actually [going to be] easier to get up and fight because you want to win and you want to show that the winning mentality is our mentality.’ Borini, 23, has worked hard to make an impression despite it appearing his Anfield career was over in the summer. ‘I think that when I was called upon to play, I did well against Real Madrid or against Chelsea, when we were down and we needed to chase the game,’ said the Italian. ‘Against Newcastle, we were at 0-0 and we needed to change the game. So it’s not an easy way to get in, but it’s good to be involved and I hope I get more [chances]. ‘In training I work hard every day, so I’ve got the game rhythm every day. So it’s easy for me to get into the game, like I showed against Swansea.

After the air steward notified the captain and the Airbus A320 was put under emergency lockdown when it landed at Dublin Airport as medics were called to the scene. An Aer Lingus flight from Milan to Dublin was placed under emergency lockdown due to an Ebola scare . A passenger showed a flight attendant a plastic cup marked with the words ‘Attentione Ebola’ Around 150 passengers and crew were forced to remain isolated on board flight EI433 on the runway apron for an hour while three of the passengers were medically examined. Airport police placed a cordon at the aircraft, which was parked at a stand. Ireland's health service, the Health Service Executive, was also called in but an examination in consultation with experts established there was no evidence of a health risk. Crew and passengers were allowed to disembark and the cordon was removed once the incident was determined to be a hoax.

"An admin error dashed the hopes of 2,500 university applicants after they received congratulatory letters of acceptance from their school of choice, even though they'd actually been rejected. Fordham University in New York sent the notifications in error after the job of contacting applicants was outsourced to a third party company called Student Aid Services. Contained in the email was a message in bold red letters which read: 'Congratulations once again on your admission to Fordham University'. Let down: The aspiring students had applied to Fordham University in the Bronx, New York (above) The words came on Wednesday, two days before . students were told to expect a decision, leading many to believe they had made the grade. After quickly realising their error the university sent out a correction note just a few hours later. The heartbreaking news for many read that the original emails 'do not reflect your status'. In total, Fordham University say that 500 of the 2,500 contacted did not get into the university while the other 2,000 have had their decision deferred. The university apologized in a statement on Thursday and said it was working to find the cause of the problem, to prevent it from happening again. Of the 2,500 people contacted, 500 had been rejected outright while the others have had their decision referred (picture posed by model) A spokesperson said: 'Fordham and its undergraduate admissions staff are acutely aware of the high hopes prospective students and their families have regarding college acceptances. 'The University deeply regrets that some applicants were misled by the financial aid notice. The admission staff is working with S.A.S. to find out what went wrong.' Craig Carroll, the chief executive of Student Aid Services said he was 'devastated by the error'. Mary Fallon, a spokeswoman for Student Aid Services, said the mistake 'occurred when data was transferred from a staging environment to our development environment.' She told the New York Times: 'Oversight errors don’t just come about, as you know.

"On a sunny day, they boast some of the finest scenery England has to offer. So can it be coincidence that some of our top seaside and country beauty spots also happen to contain the locals who pull the most sick days? Employees in areas near beauty spots such as Worthing in West Sussex (pictured) are off with illness up to three weeks a year compared to national average of four days, Public Health England's regional figures show . A league table of workplace absenteeism is enough to make even a trusting boss raise an eyebrow. It suggests a rather suspicious link between the number of days taken off ill and places where there’s a range of temptations on the doorstep. Employees round Worthing and Shoreham in West Sussex – fringed on one side by miles of south coast beaches and rolling hills on another – are the most likely to come down with something. The league of Britain's workplace sickness numbers shows most are from the country's top locations . They have almost three working weeks off sick each year compared with a national average of around four days. Curiously, the top ten features next to none of the industrial heartlands which traditionally have the worst health records. Instead, the most ailing staff are from places like the Cotswolds and Allerdale in the heart of the Lake District. Public Health England’s 2010-2012 figures give a regional breakdown of the proportion of working days lost to sickness absence. The national average was 1.6 per cent, around four days per year per person. But Adur has the highest rate of all: 5.5 per cent which is approximately 14 days. The district incorporates the seaside towns of Lancing and Shoreham-by-Sea, which are popular with sunbathers and surfers. Second in the table is Weymouth & Portland in Dorset (4.3 per cent – 11 days), a resort built on miles of sandy beaches. Also featuring in the top ten with 3.7 per cent (nine days) are Tendring in Essex, which includes the holiday hotspots of Clacton and Frinton-on-Sea; the picturesque rural haven of the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire and Allerdale in Cumbria which boasts Lake District beauty spots such as Keswick and Buttermere. Among the best rates nationwide were Sedgemoor in Somerset and Wyre in Lancashire – where the typical employee takes next to no time at all off sick . Ken Bishop, a Shoreham-by-Sea councillor, said: ‘Perhaps it is just too tempting round here on a nice day to think “to hell with work”. ‘This is a great place to be. It still has a villagey feel to it and everybody knows everybody else – though that means you’d have to be careful you weren’t spotted on the beach when you were supposed to be in bed ill.’ Adur has the highest rate of work place absenteeism and pictured is a marina on the River Adur at Shoreham .

"Australia's heightened terror alert saw naval personnel returning for duties urged to  'look after your mates' and ordered not to wear their uniforms in public. HMAS Sydney has just returned to the Garden Island naval base in Sydney Harbour after taking part in Exercise Kakadu, which is Australia's biggest naval warfare training drill, and border protection duties. Those on board were under strict instruction to change into their civilian clothes ahead of leaving the dock with their loved ones. Colleagues from within the base were seen to be admonished by gate security earlier in the day, when they had apparently forgotten the edict. Before and after. HMAS Sydney crew walk down the gangplank during their homecoming at Garden Island in full uniform but (left) leave the naval base in civilian clothes (right) Welcome home dad! HMAS Sydney crew members are re-acquainted with family and friends on the ship's return to Garden Island. Able Seaman Candice Beech, into her third year serving and part of the vessel's Communications team, did confirm that, despite their 6 months away from home, all the crew was well aware of the recent counter-terrorism operations and measures in Australia. On the back of two reported incidents against members of the navy, one which has since been ruled out, an email was circulated yesterday by a high-ranking naval officer to commanders, advising them that 'all ADF personnel are instructed not to wear uniforms externally'. As for that order not to be walking the streets in uniform or fatigues, she said 'it doesn't faze us'. HMAS Sydney crew members have been away for six months, involved in border protection duties and war games during Exercise Kakadu . After the reunions, sailors were quick to change out of their uniforms, as directed by superiors, before leaving the naval base . 'Everyone is just happy to be home, we still feel safe here,' Able Seaman Beech told Daily Mail Australia. But there was also another very clear message from their superiors before docking at Garden Island. 'To be aware, not alert, just look out for your mates, keep an eye on everything, as we do always - we always keep an eye out,' she added. Crew member Able Seaman Candice Beech returned home to a warm welcome from her parents and nephew . HMAS Sydney crew were told 'to be aware, not alert, just look out for your mates, keep an eye on everything, as we do always - we always keep an eye out' The 'Sydney' is one of four guided missile frigates left in the Royal Australian Navy fleet, with 210 crew members under the guidance of Commander Karl Brinckmann. Candice's family, including parents Cathy and Larry, was on hand - banner and all - to welcome her back to dry land. 'We're really proud of her and she's proud to be in the navy, she'll keep safe, they all do,' said Mrs Beech. 'No I don't think it (not wearing the uniform) will be a problem, she likes to wear them but if it's going to be a problem, she won't.' Able Seaman Beech was happy to be home after serving in war games and border protection duties. 'It was really good, I mean you get used to it - first couple of weeks are hard,' she said. 'You miss family a lot but then you just get into your routine. Go to work, go to bed, work out.' Naval bases have been moved onto their highest alert level of 'Charlie' and tighter security measures have included updating of identification cards for naval personnel and civilian contractors. Strict security was in place as family and friends arrived at Garden Island to welcome home HMAS Sydney . Naval bases are all at the highest alert level of 'Charlie' and tighter security measures have included updating of identification cards for naval personnel and civilian contractors. Even those arriving at the HMAS Kuttabul base in Sydney's east were dressed in civilian clothes and not their defence gear. Defence chief Mark Binskin says 'I want people to be aware of of their situations and aware of their surroundings' Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, the ADF Commander, today insisted he would not be issuing a general alert for all ADF personnel to avoid wearing their uniforms and instead would leave that up to others. 'I want people to be aware of of their situations and aware of their surroundings,' he said. 'People are aware of it, commanders will make those decisions as to what is best for their people.'

"Brazil's World Cup hopes this summer rest on the shoulders of their 22-year-old Barcelona star Neymar. But can he live up to the achievements of the greatest players ever to have worn the shirt of The Selecao. A new star: Neymar is Brazil's new star - but will make the list of top Brazilians . 10: Carlos Alberto (1964-77) Captain of the best Brazil team of all time and scored the goal that became a trademark for 'The Beautiful Game' Carlos Alberto was nominally Brazil’s right-back in 1970 but that didn't really matter as the team developed a new style where defenders were as liable to do tricks and score goals as forwards. Alberto’s overlapping run to shoot in Pele’s pass in the final against Italy has been re-run millions of times around the world ever since. Besides that goal, Carlos Alberto was a popular captain in a team of huge talent and ego. Brazilians feel his exclusion from the 1966 squad was the reason they failed the year that England won it. Captain Carlos: Carlos Alberto played a key role for Brazil in the 1970s . 9: Ronaldinho (1999-2013) His perennial toothy grin and array of tricks and flicks brought the joy back to Brazilian football after they’d won the World Cup in 1994 in a more austere manner. Ronaldinho was the ultimate playboy footballer who enjoyed life on and off the pitch. He exploded on to the scene at the 2002 World Cup having arrived as a relatively unknown with Paris St Germain, who weren’t the major force they are today. Manager Felipe Scolari gave Ronaldinho freedom and he was the best young player in the tournament. His winner against England from near the touchline was condemned as a fluke by fans here, but in Brazil they remain convinced he meant it. Some would love to have seen him in this year’s World Cup squad even at the age of 34. Box of tricks: Ronaldinho was a star for Brazil for over a decade . 8: Leonidas (1932-38) Scored 37 goals in 37 games for Brazil and nicknamed 'The Black Diamond' as the country’s first genuine football superstar. He brought a new skill to football - the bicycle kick – which earned him another nickname, The Rubber Man. And he was at his peak during the 1938 World Cup, which he top-scored with seven goals. In fact, if Leonidas had not been injured for the semi-final against eventual winners Italy, Brazil might have claimed their first World Cup then, instead of waiting another 20 years until 1958. Leonidas was small and quick, changing the assumption that you had to be big to succeed and paving the way for future superstars like Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. The Black Diamond: Leonidas scored 37 goals in 37 games for Brazil . 7: Roberto Carlos (1992-2006) Full-backs are seen as hugely important positions in the modern international game – a status largely down to Roberto Carlos. Describing the long-time Real Madrid player as a left-back seems strangely insufficient. He was given the freedom to roam forward by Luis Felipe Scolari, who picked two holding midfielders to accommodate him – another trend copied by other managers since. Roberto Carlos was hugely important to Brazil’s win at the 2002 World Cup. He is also regarded as the most spectacular of Brazilian free-kick takers, quite a claim. His most famous strike came against France at Le Tournoi in 1997, a strike that was heading well past the post until it changed trajectory at the last moment. Set piece king: Roberto Carlos was a threat from free kicks . 6: Jairzinho (1964-82) Scored in every game of Brazil’s 1970 World Cup triumph including the final – a record that remains unsurpassed. Jairzinho was the first of the versatile attacking players, possessing the speed and trickery to be an effective winger, and the shooting power and finishing ability to be a centre-forward. He’d recovered from two broken legs to take his place in the 1970 team and though Pele, Gerson, Tostao and Rivelino dictated matches, he finished the chances. He scored the only goal in a titanic group game against England and the third in Brazil’s 4-1 win in the final against Italy. He played in the 1974 World Cup and such was the respect for him in Brazil, they allowed him  an international send-off at the age of 38 in 1982, against Czechoslovakia. In the goals: Jairzinho scored in every game in the 1970 World Cup . 5: Garrincha (1955-66) Together with Pele, he helped pave the way for future generations of black players to star in the modern era for Brazil. Dubbed The Little Bird, Garrincha used a physical abnormality – one leg significantly shorter than the other – to his own huge advantage, giving him a body-swerve other wingers couldn’t emulate. He was drafted in with Pele at the 1958 World Cup – a breakthrough moment for black footballers – and together they led Brazil to the trophy. Four years later with Pele injured, Garrincha single-handedly helped Brazil retain the cup, becoming the tournament’s joint top-scorer in 1962. He is revered in Brazil where his journey from poverty to superstardom, and problems with womanising and alcoholism, is the stuff of folklore . The little bird: Garrincha helped pave the way for black players in Brazil . 4: Romario (1987-2005) A one-touch finisher par excellence, Romario was responsible for ending Brazil’s long 24-year wait for the World Cup. The striker, with an extraordinary low centre of gravity, was the heartbeat of the Brazil side that lifted the trophy in 1994. He perfected the toe-poke finish but arguably his most important goal came with his head – the winner in the World Cup semi-final against Sweden. Unlike his 1970 Brazilian counterparts, Romario played his club football in Europe and was a huge hit with PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona, whose manager Johan Cruyff labelled him ‘a genius’. Scored 55 goals in 70 games for Brazil. Winner: Romario (lifting the trophy) played a key role in helping Brazil win the World Cup in 1994 . 3: Ronaldo (1994-2011) The leading World Cup goalscorer of all-time and possibly the greatest comeback story ever told. The biggest superstar in the world in 1998, the 21-year-old suffered a mysterious breakdown - some reports suggest it was a convulsive fit - before the World Cup final against France. His name was scrubbed off the team sheet, then reinstated to huge drama, but he looked a shadow of his normal self in a 3-0 defeat for Brazil. The next four years were wrecked by injuries with cynics doubting he could maintain his blistering pace following a series of knee operations. Instead, he dominated the 2002 World Cup in Japan and scored both goals in the final against Germany to earn Brazil their fifth and most recent World Cup. One of the best: Ronaldo has been one of the best Brazilians in the modern era . 2: Zico (1976-86) Would probably be considered on a par with Pele had he won the World Cup. Unfortunately, the 1982 side he starred in blew up against Italy and instead gained the reputation as the greatest team never to have been world champions. Zico is undoubtedly regarded in Brazil as the equal of the other great names in this list who have won the World Cup. As an all-round talent, it is hard to think of anyone his equal; he was the ultimate creative No 10 but also added goals, pace, set-pieces and heading to his game. He played in three World Cups – Scotland fans will remember Alan Rough’s look of disbelief as his free-kick flew into the ‘postage stamp’ of the goal in 1982 – but infamously missed a penalty against France in the 1986 quarter-final having just come on as substitute. Missing out: Zico must be one of the best Brazilians never to win the World Cup . 1: Pele (1957-71) Regarded with Diego Maradona as the greatest player of all-time, and with Muhammad Ali the most internationally-recognised sportsman of all-time. Pele scored more than a thousand goals in his career and is the only player to win three World Cups, starting in 1958 as a 17-year-old. He’s so famous, even the long version of his name Edson Arantes do Nascimento is known to fans around the world. Icon: Pele is considered to be the best player to play the game . Simply the best: Pele won three World Cups with Brazil in 1958, 1962 and 1970 . Due to the 1960s introduction of satellite television and boom in air travel, Pele became football’s first true international superstar as The Beatles were in the entertainment world. He also introduced the United States to soccer with the New York Cosmos. The 1970 World Cup was his zenith, featuring an attempted shot from the halfway line, his outrageous dummy against Uruguay, the Gordon Banks save and his hug with Bobby Moore that encapsulated sportsmanship. The Brazilian which all others – Neymar included – have to aspire to.","Neymar showed he is Brazil's star of today, but how world he have does he compare to the greats?
Carlos Alberto, Jairzinho, Zico all feature from the golden age of Brazilian football .
Ronaldinho, Roberto Carlos, Romario and Ronaldo are the stars from the modern era to make the list ."

Across the rest of the UK, there will be sunny spells but this will be peppered with showers, which could be heavy with the risk of thunder. The showers are expected to be most frequent in the south and west of England and Wales. By Saturday, there could be a few showers  in northern Scotland, but there should be a lot of dry weather around. But in the UK, it will be another mixed day of sunshine and showers. Forecasters say the showers could be 'heavy and prolonged for a time', especially in the west, with the risk of thunder. These showers are expected to be most frequent in Wales and the south and west of England, while most of the sunshine will be in Scotland. In Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, gusts of almost 50mph were recorded, causing huge high tide storms . A spokesman for the Met Office said the high tide storms had been caused by spring tides peaking - shown here in Peterhead - mixed with the strength and direction of the gusts of wind .

"Fresh evidence that  MI5 and Special Branch  covered up Sir Cyril Smith’s abuse of children has been found in a police dossier. The file, which accuses the Liberal Democrat MP of ‘a sordid series of indecent episodes with young boys’, was handed to prosecutors in 1970 but then went missing for more than four decades. It was discovered by a team of investigators from  Channel 4’s Dispatches. A police file which accuses late Lib Dem MP . Cyril Smith of 'a sordid series of indecent episodes with young boys' which went missing four decades ago has been unearthed by reporters from . Channel 4's Dispatches . The file reveals that the 29-stone politician was accused of eight counts of sex abuse, including six offences at a care home he set up in his Rochdale constituency. The case has strong parallels with that of former BBC DJ and abuser Jimmy Savile, who was allowed access to patients at Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General Infirmary. The Dispatches reporter, Liz MacKean, worked on the BBC Newsnight investigation into Savile in 2011. That programme was shelved later that year – sparking a crisis at the corporation and her  acrimonious departure. Smith, who died three years ago aged 82, was a guest on an edition of Savile’s show Clunk Click that was broadcast in 1973. Parallels to the Savile case: The 29-stone . politician was accused of eight counts of sex abuse, including six . offences at a care home he set up in Rochdale . Miss MacKean has unearthed evidence that the file containing claims against the MP was  suppressed at the highest levels of the Establishment. The allegations first surfaced last year when Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, called on Home Secretary Theresa May to investigate whether MI5 were involved in a cover-up. Dispatches spoke to a former Special Branch detective, Tony Robinson, who said he found the file in a safe at police headquarters in Lancashire. He claimed he took a call in 1977 from ‘Box 500’, the police codeword for MI5, requesting the file be sent to London by special courier. At the time, Smith was heavily involved in negotiations to keep James Callaghan’s government in office through a pact between Labour and the Liberals. Another officer, Paul Foulston, told Dispatches he was ordered by Special Branch in London not to interview a witness in a murder inquiry. He claimed they then discovered the 18-year-old, who was soon ruled out of the investigation, had been involved in a sexual relationship with Smith. Mr Foulston said: ‘It was quite apparent to us that they were in effect protecting Cyril Smith and not investigating him.’ The police file names eight victims who describe being stripped, massaged, beaten and subjected to bizarre ‘hygiene examinations’ or ‘chastisements’ by Smith. One victim told Dispatches he was so . upset he ran away from Cambridge House care home and was forced to live . rough for several months. Another, . Chris Marshall, said he was taken from his dormitory and abused by . Smith in a bedroom in Knowle View school – another Rochdale institution . set up by the politician. He told the programme: ‘They had the evidence to stop him, didn’t they? They knew what he was up to.’ Smith strains the benches of the House of . Commons: Dispatches reporter Liz MacKean has found evidence that the file . containing claims against the MP was suppressed at the highest levels of . the Establishment . A police chief said yesterday that a lack of leadership from responsible authorities led to abusers Savile, Smith and Stuart Hall getting away with their crimes for so long. Andy Rhodes, assistant chief constable of Lancashire Constabulary, told delegates at a child sexual exploitation conference near Blackburn that gaining knowledge of the subject and acting upon it was the key to tackling the problem. Mr Rhodes told the meeting: ‘The reason Cyril Smith, Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall got away with what they got away with, which was serious, serious prolonged sexual exploitation of young people, was because leaders who had responsibility to do something, did not do it. ‘They turned a blind eye. Buried their heads in the sand. ‘There are a lot of leaders around the country (now) becoming aware and increasing their knowledge about what sexual exploitation is all about in their areas.’ The Paedophile MP – How Cyril Smith Got Away With It is on Channel 4 tonight at 11pm.","Lib Dem MP for Rochdale was accused of eight counts of sex abuse .

"Danny Sherwood, 31, was given two 12-month suspended prison sentences at Bournemouth Crown Court months after he was jailed for a similar crime . A 'predatory' roofer who repeatedly swindled pensioners out of thousands of pounds could strike again after he avoided jail for his latest con, officials have warned. Danny Sherwood, 31, told a disabled 60-year-old she needed £90 of work done to her roof but ended up charging her a whopping £5,680. He was  handed two 12-month suspended prison sentences at Bournemouth Crown Court just months after he was jailed for a similar crime. Sherwood pleaded guilty to misleading commercial practice in his dealings with Christine Coales, who suffers with ME, fibromyalgia and arthritis. The serial offender has already served nine months in prison for overcharging a 73-year-old woman £2,150 for £630 of work in 2012. He even drove her to a cashpoint to withdraw the money. In 2011, he also admitted engaging in a misleading commercial practice after informing an 86-year-old Ferndown woman that her roof needed £700 of work done. Andy Sherriff, manager of Bournemouth council's Trading Standards unit, said: 'Danny Sherwood's behaviour is contemptible. As the court saw, he aims to exploit the elderly and vulnerable and, when caught, shows no true remorse. 'Regrettably, it seems that spells in custody provide little deterrent. It doesn't look as though he's learnt his lesson. 'However, we have a team of officers who have worked hard to gather evidence and take this matter to court, and we continue do our best to protect all our local residents. 'The fact we repeatedly put Sherwood and his like in front of the courts should demonstrate that we are determined to pursue fraudsters and confidence tricksters. People should be allowed to feel confident in their own homes.' His father Kevin Sherwood (left) and brother Kevin Jr (right) have also been convicted of conning pensioners . In his latest scam Sherwood convinced Coales she needed minor repair work on her roof, but then proceeded to remove the whole roof. Prosecutor Duncan Milne said Sherwood's move to replace the whole roof was 'entirely unnecessary and unjustified' according to an independent surveyor. Recorder Gordon Bebb QC said Daniel Sherwood, who has two previous convictions for similar offences, showed 'predatory behaviour' and 'took advantage' of the 60-year-old. He ordered him to pay £1,900 compensation to Mrs Coales and £1,000 towards costs. Sherwood was found guilty of seven counts of fraud at Bournemouth Crown Court in April after needlessly removing a chimney at the vulnerable pensioner’s home in Rossmore in September 2012. Margaret Williamson and Alan Read spoke of their shame at being conned by Kevin Sherwood . He was also found guilty of charging £2,150 for roofing work worth just £630 and of engaging in an aggressive practice in driving her to the cash point. Sherwood comes from a family of rogue traders in Bournemouth, Dorset - his brother and father have also both been convicted of ripping off elderly customers . His father Kevin Sherwood was sentenced to 12 months in prison and given an ASBO in January 2013 stopping him from taking advantage of pensioners. Alan Read and his partner Margaret, 82 said they were duped into handing £7,000 to Kevin Sherwood who needlessly replaced their roof. Sherwood Snr committed his crimes in September 2011 - five months after his son Kevin Jr tried to trick a vulnerable pensioner out of thousands of pounds after convincing him his garage roof was dangerous. He turned up at his victim's house one morning and offered to fix some tiles which had mysteriously fallen off in return for £50. Eventually, he charged the elderly man £3,700 for the straightforward work. He was given a nine-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service.","Danny Sherwood has been spared jail for con which targeted pensioner .

"A middle-class mother with £300,000 in a Swiss bank account and children in top fee-paying schools carried on claiming benefits as 'pocket money', a court was told today. Caroline Foxley, 58, was  a 'greedy' woman who had made a 'calm, calculated and rational' decision to abuse the benefits system out of more than £20,000, Gloucester Crown Court heard. She is alleged to have claimed income support, Jobseeker's Allowance and council tax and housing benefits, while she had more than £300,000 in the bank. Caroline Foxley, 58, of Teignmouth, Devon,is accused of committing a £20,000 benefits fraud . Ms Foxley, formerly of Mickleton, Gloucestershire, but now living in Teignmouth, Devon, denies four charges of dishonestly failing to report a change in her circumstances and dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits between March 2007 and March 2009. The court heard the interest she was receiving on her money was around £300 every couple of weeks - more than the benefits she was claiming. Yet when she filled out forms certifying she still qualified for benefits she said she had only £100 in a Lloyds TSB account. 'This case is about greed really,' said prosecutor Stephen Mooney. 'It involves her making a calm, calculated and rational decision, in fact quite a number of them, to top up her already quite substantial income by making false claims for benefit.' He told the court Foxley had abused a system designed to be a safety net for people unable to finance their lives and in danger of ending up sleeping rough on the streets. He added: 'It is not supposed to be a source of pocket money or additional income for wealthy people like Ms Foxley who decide that is what they would like. 'It is the prosecution case that this is a thoroughly dishonest woman who decided to get money she knew she was not entitled to in the hope and expectation, and arrogance, that she would not be caught. 'Greedy people bank on not being caught but this was a gamble in respect of which this woman failed.' The benefit rules did not allow anyone with more than £16,000 in the bank to be paid any State benefits, he said. She paid the money into an Indian bank and then started using the money which included paying fees to Cheltenham Ladies' College (pictured), it was said . Until March 30th 2007 she did qualify but she then sold a house which made her £306,000, said Mr Mooney. She paid the money into an Indian bank and then started using the money which included paying fees to Cheltenham Ladies' College, Malvern College and Bloxham School, Banbury, he said. 'These are not cheap schools,' he said. 'Between 2007 and 2009 when she was claiming poverty and penury she paid in the region of £48,000 to Bloxham School. 'This was a woman who had certain high expectations and standards for her children and a sense that she was entitled to a particular standard of living and she was going to have it come what may. 'You would either have to be colossally stupid or fraudulently dishonest to continue claiming benefits when you had £306,000 in the bank.' During the course of the alleged deceptions, he said, she transferred her money into Habibsons Bank - a Swiss bank with a branch in London. 'No doubt she was taking advantage of the notorious and well documented reluctance of the Gnomes of Zurich to give out information about their bank accounts.The money went back to Zurich, spirited away, no doubt, to be used by Ms Foxley.' Mr Mooney said that when the alleged frauds were detected Ms Foxley was 'like a chameleon on a tartan hook' not knowing which way to turn when questioned by investigators. Her explanation was 'like a sort of fraudster's equivalent of ""the dog ate my homework"",' he said. She claimed the money in the account was not hers and was needed by her ex husband in Italy to settle debts. She produced a document to support that claim but the prosecution alleged it was a false document, he went on. 'What we have here is a woman who has been caught out and frankly she doesn't like being caught out. She regards it as rather an affront that those perhaps less clever than her, less sophisticated than her, and less entitled than her, should have the right to pursue her. 'And all this at a time when the poorest in society are having their entitlement to benefits cut from beneath them because of the austerity which affects all of us - but not her. 'This is a case of someone using the benefits system as their own pocket money to help finance an already wealthy lifestyle.' The case continues.

"U.S. aviation regulators loosened restrictions on the commercial use of drones on Thursday, granting six television and movie production companies permission to use the small, remotely piloted aircraft to shoot scenes on closed sets. The Federal Aviation Administration said it would allow filming with drones provided the aircraft weigh 55 pounds (25 kg) or less, are used within sight of the remote pilot, who must hold a private pilot's license, and are flown under 400 feet (120 meters) in altitude, among other restrictions. The approval marks a major advance for the growing drone industry, which is expected to generate billions of dollars in economic activity once restrictions on commercial use of drones are removed. The FAA currently bans most commercial drone flights, but is required by Congress to integrate drones into the U.S. airspace in coming years. Ready for takeoff: The Federal Aviation Administration said it would allow filming with drones provided the aircraft weigh 55 pounds (25 kg) or less, are used within sight of the remote pilot, who must hold a private pilot's license, and are flown under 400 feet (120 meters) in altitude, among other restrictions . 'This is the first step to allowing the film and television industry to use unmanned aircraft systems in our nation's airspace, and it's a milestone in the wider effort to allow unmanned aircraft for many different types of commercial use,' Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a conference call. The six companies that received FAA exemptions from the drone ban are Astraeus Aerial, Aerial MOB LLC, HeliVideo Productions LLC, Pictorvision Inc, RC Pro Productions Consulting LLC dba Vortex Aerial, and Snaproll Media, LLC. The FAA said it has asked for additional information from Flying-Cam Inc, a seventh aerial video company that filed for exemptions with this group in June. The agency said it is working closely with the company to obtain the information. In granting the exemptions, the FAA barred the six companies from making drone flights at night, required that flights take place on sets closed to the public, and said operators must inspect the aircraft before each flight. The approval marks a major advance for the growing drone industry, which is expected to generate billions of dollars in economic activity once restrictions on commercial use of drones are removed . The film and television industry hailed the FAA decision. 'Today's announcement is a great victory for the industry but also a great victory for audiences,' Chris Dodd, chairman and chief executive officer of the Motion Picture Association of America, said on the conference call. Dodd noted that drones have been used in other countries to film scenes in such movies as the James Bond film 'Skyfall' and the 'Harry Potter' series. 'This is going to bring a lot of business back home to the United States,' he said. The drone industry has mushroomed in recent years with the arrival of small, inexpensive remote-control aircraft that can carry cameras, sensors or other equipment that makes them useful for a wide range of uses, from inspecting oil pipelines to crop dusting to locating people lost in the wilderness. The drone industry would create at least 70,000 U.S. jobs in the first three years after the aircraft are integrated into U.S. airspace, and generate nearly $14 billion in economic activity, according to the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a trade group. The FAA's approval shows the agency working relatively quickly to approve new uses, since the petitions for exemptions were filed in May and June. Under law, the agency had to respond to the requests in 120 days, said attorney Jonathan Hill, of counsel at Cooley LLP, who filed the exemption requests to the FAA. 'It's for the six specific companies on closed-set filming,' said Hill. 'It's restrictive and regulatory in nature. But it's a welcome first step.' The exemptions come as the FAA is still drafting proposed rules for integrating commercial drones into the national airspace . The exemptions come as the FAA is still drafting proposed rules for integrating commercial drones into the national airspace. A draft set of those rules is circulating in Washington, according to industry sources, but the FAA is widely expected to miss a deadline of publishing the draft rules this year. Final approval is expected to be years away, which means exemptions like those granted on Thursday are the only way businesses can legally get permission to use them. Last year, the U.S. government created six sites for testing broader commercial uses, in Alaska, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Texas and Virginia. Among the potential uses: Google Inc has said it is developing airborne drones capable of flying on their own and delivering anything from candy to medicine. Amazon.com Inc announced plans last year to use drones to make home deliveries.","The FAA will let the production companies fly small drones on closed sets in the US .

"Roads that glow in the dark and could one day even charge electric cars are set to be introduced in the Netherlands from next year. 'Smart Highways' unveiled last week at Dutch Design Week will use the latest technologies in roads their designers claim will be 'more sustainable, safe and intuitive'.

Electric priority lane: Special lanes which will allow drivers of electric cars to recharge their vehicles as they travel along them are among the most ambitious ideas put forward . Energy efficient: Another plan is to fit motorways with lighting that brightens as vehicles approach then dims after they pass, saving electricity that would otherwise be wasted lighting empty roads . Among the most ambitious of the ideas for the future of road travel are special lanes which will allow drivers of electric cars to recharge their vehicles as they travel along them. Another plan is to fit the roads with power-saving lights which will gradually brighten as vehicles approach then switch themselves off after they pass. Those ideas are still some years off, but from next year Dutch roads will be painted with lines made from a photo-luminescent powder that charges in sunlight to illuminate the road for up to 10 hours overnight. Another technology aimed for implementation next year is temperature-responsive dynamic paint which will make ice-crystals visible to drivers when cold weather makes road surfaces slippery. The ideas - developed by Dutch firms Studio Roosegaarde and Heijmans Infrastructure - have already been hailed as 'Best Future Concept' at the Dutch Design Awards. However, there is as yet no information on how lanes which recharge electric cars travelling among them might work.

"Thousands of dementia patients are hiding symptoms from loved ones and doctors because they are ashamed, a report warns. It compares the stigma to that of HIV and Aids in the 1980s and says as many as a quarter of those suffering are refusing to speak out. Doctors say patients tell them how their friends ‘disappeared’ after they were diagnosed and in some cases how their own children have stopped visiting. Scroll down for video . Thousands of dementia patients are hiding the symptoms from their loved ones because they are ashamed, a new report warns (file image) A joint report led by the Medical Research Council warns that this ‘unacceptable stigma’ is denying patients vital help and resulting in them being ‘marginalised’ from the rest of society. Around 850,000 patients in Britain are thought to have dementia but only half have been given a proper diagnosis. The Government is urging GPs to improve their detection rates over concerns that victims and their families are struggling in silence. But part of the problem is that many patients are too afraid to be diagnosed so do not make an appointment in the first place. Professor Hugh Perry, chairman of the neuroscience and mental health board at the MRC, said: ‘The embarrassment and shame of having a disease associated with both age and mental health is a real barrier to people seeking the help they need. ‘A long time ago there was a stigma attached to cancer and more recently HIV. In both cases it stopped people from getting treatment and that’s sadly the case with dementia.’ The report is based on in-depth interviews of patients with dementia, their relatives, specialist doctors and academics. Sylvia Kahn, 77, a retired solicitor, was diagnosed with dementia three years ago. She said that since then people ‘don’t want to know’ and often ‘turn away’. The grandmother, who lives with her husband Bob in Warrington, Cheshire, said: ‘Those of us with Alzheimer’s are often deeply hurt when people are afraid to talk to us. ‘Why should you stigmatise us? We didn’t ask for the dementia. It’s not a crime.’ Mrs Kahn decided to leave her job after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s following a series of memory scans in 2011. With her husband she now works for the Alzheimer’s Society giving talks and helping raise funding for the research. It describes how patients’ friends and close relatives often distance themselves and don’t ‘dare ask’ how they are. In some cases, the report warns that patients’ own children stop visiting them because the deterioration is ‘too hard to watch’. And it also cites figures from a study in 2012 involving 157 dementia patients which found one in four had tried to hide their symptoms from family and friends. George McNamara, head of policy and public affairs at the Alzheimer’s Society, which was also involved in the report said: ‘We’ve come a long way in terms of raising awareness but we still need to do more as a society to banish the stigma surrounding dementia once and for all.’ In a forward to the report, Professor Alistair Burns, a Department of Health expert on dementia and Baroness Sally Greengross, chairman of the All-Parliamentary Group on dementia, write: ‘We still have much to understand about why dementia remains outside the realm of acceptable conversation.’ Early symptoms of dementia include loss of memory, difficulties concentrating, depression and confusion. Certain drugs including donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine can temporarily halt the decline but only if given in the early stages. Last year David Cameron pledged to make dementia a national priority and said there would be a cure by 2025. The Government has also promised that by next year doctors will have diagnosed two thirds of all patients with the illness. Recent estimates show diagnosis is as low as 45 per cent and in some areas as low as one in seven. Last week it emerged NHS officials were planning to pay GPs £55 for every new patient diagnosed with dementia between now and March. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Real change is needed, that’s why we are working with the Alzheimer’s Society and Public Health England to help tackle stigma and increase understanding.’","Report warns stigma is depriving patients of the vital help they need .

"An plasterer murdered his identical twin brother on New Year's Eve with a kitchen knife before going to a party, a court heard. Robert Cerqua's brother Christopher, a carpenter, was left with a seven-inch stomach wound after the 31-year-olds began arguing about 'the past' at their parents' house in Hythe, Hampshire. Jurors in Robert's murder trial were played a chilling 13-minute 999 call by the pair's  parents, who pleaded with police to break up the fight before their father cried out: 'He's stabbed him'. Accused: Robert Cerqua (left) is charged with murdering his twin brother Christopher (right) with a kitchen knife in a New Year's Eve argument, then fleeing their parents' house barefoot and going to a party until 2.20am . The 'extremely drunk' brother then left without putting on his shoes, joined his girlfriend at a New Year's Eve party and turned off his phone so he was uncontactable, Winchester Crown Court heard. Christopher's father tried to stem his bleeding with a tea towel as he lay on the kitchen floor, but he had a cardiac arrest less than an hour later and was declared dead in hospital. Police found Robert at a party in nearby Totton at 2.20am and told him he was being arrested - to which he replied only: 'Murder?' He then fell asleep in the back of a police car on the way to Southampton Central Police station, jurors heard. When he woke up, he said: 'Is he dead? You are lying, he cannot be'. While being taken to his cell, he added: 'Was it me? Was it me? I cannot remember. Honestly, is my brother dead?' And when he was told the charge against him the next day, he allegedly said: 'I killed my f****** brother. I don’t want to be here any more. 'Nine times out of ten it would be all right. [That’s] just my luck, he had to die on me.' Distraught: The jury was played a 13-minute 999 call by the 31-year-olds' parents Peter and Denise (pictured) Cerqua, who denies murder and told police his brother had threatened him, listened in the dock as the case was opened against him yesterday. Prosecutor Nicholas Haggan QC said the brothers had spent a 'happy and relaxed' evening drinking at their parents’ terraced house from 6pm on December 31 last year. But things soured at about 8pm when they started talking about 'the past', Mr Haggan said - leading to the emotional 999 call at 9pm by their mother Denise and father Peter. Abandoned party food such as cheese, apple and crackers and cans of Stella Artois lay littered around the room where Christopher was stabbed. The couple have watched previous hearings from the public gallery, but were absent yesterday as their remaining son went on trial. Mr Haggan told the jury of nine men and three women: 'This is a tragic case. In a nutshell, it was New Year’s Eve last year and both brothers had been drinking. 'Shortly before 9pm an argument started between the two brothers and that argument appears to have turned into a tussle. Punches may have been exchanged. 'At some point, this defendant picked up a kitchen knife and he used it to stab his brother. 'The defendant inflicted just one wound, but the tract of that wound was quite long, about 15 - 17 centimetres or approximately six or seven inches, and it punctured the aorta, the principle artery which runs down a person’s trunk. 'That injury caused major internal bleeding and Christopher’s subsequent collapse.' A post mortem revealed a six to seven inch stab wound on Christopher’s abdomen which cut through his aorta. Tests showed he had 230 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, around three times the drink drive limit. Traces of cannabis and antidepressants were also found. His face was bruised from a punch and where he fell to the ground. Robert told police he had drunk six cans of lager and two glasses of red wine before leaving the house. Murder scene: The alleged argument broke out at the twins' parents' house in Hythe, Hampshire (pictured) In interviews, Robert Cerqua said his brother had been threatening him with the knife and he had either taken it, or picked up another, in a bid to defend himself. The kitchen knife said to have been used - its handle broken and the blade bent - was discovered in the kitchen sink. DNA found on the knife matched both the defendant and his brother because, as identical twins, they shared the same DNA profile. In his first police interview on New Year's Day, Robert described his relationship with Christopher as 'fiery' and said drink could make him 'nasty' and 'short-tempered'. He added: 'We started arguing, I do not know about what... All I can remember is he picked a knife up and walked towards me and I sort of panicked. 'I do not remember much. I punched him - I had a knife in my hand. He yelped and I ran out of the door.' In a later interview he said he had not intended to kill his brother but had 'just reacted'. Jurors heard text messages between Robert Cerqua and his girlfriend, Joelle Mansfield, which showed how the mood deteriorated. Defendant: Robert Cerqua denies murder at Winchester Crown Court, Hampshire, where the trial continues . An earlier message from Cerqua read: 'I cannot wait to marry you!!! xxx', followed at 6.30pm by: 'Yes sexy. Chris wishes happy ‘New Year! xxx'. But at 7pm he wrote: 'Me and Chris are going at it. Talking about past. We got things to sort out but all good. Enjoy your night my lovely, I love you'. At 8:10pm he wrote: 'There might be a fight in a minute. This is my life!! Don’t want this but what can I do. Had enough. Sorry but this is what I have got to put up with and I hate it. This is my life. Sorry, but blokes. Want to f*** off anywhere but here'. Christopher Cerqua was described in tributes as 'thoughtful and caring', and had recently got back together with girlfriend Lisa Harfield, 40, a receptionist. The couple had previously dated for six years and her son and three daughters described him as a ‘father figure’. Closing his opening statement, Mr Haggan said: 'This was a tragedy for Christopher, for his parents and for his family. 'No doubt the defendant bitterly regrets that moment of stupidity when he picked up that knife and chose to use it as he did, but it was not, we say, an act of self defence.

"A mother-of-two lost 12st after being embarrassed by photos taken when she was her sister's maid of honour. Sharon Osawe, 34, of Sleaford, Lincolnshire, ballooned to size 34 partly due to an addiction to fizzy drinks which saw her consume up to 18 litres of cherryade a week. Facing mounting obesity-related health problems Ms Osawe decided to seek help after being humiliated by pictures of her in a drab, extra-large grey suit she was forced to wear as maid of honour at her sister Julie's wedding. Sharon, pictured on her sister's wedding day, had struggled with her weight since childhood . By the time of her sister's wedding Sharon weighed 25st and wore size 34 clothing (left), forcing her to wear a suit instead of the dress worn by the other bridesmaids (right) She was approved for a gastric band operation on the NHS and went on to slim down to the 13st, size 14 she is today. She said: 'I was so upset when I tried to fit into my bridesmaid's suit that I actually cried. I'd ordered three suits, and two of them wouldn't get over my thighs. It was humiliating. 'Now that I've lost the weight I feel so much happier. I know I'll never go back to the way I was.' Ms Osawe, who has struggled with her weight since adolescence, felt that her eating habits were out of control by the time she gave birth to her son Austyn, now five. Sharon used to eat two steak and kidney pies with a large plate of chips or fish and chips with four rounds of bread and butter for her evening meal and drink two litres of cherryade a day . She said: 'I used the pregnancy to make excuses to overeat and after Austyn arrived I found myself reaching for convenience food before anything else. 'I would go all day without eating a thing, then eat quick and easy, high-fat foods and stodgy bread all evening. 'My biggest downfall was definitely cherryade. I drank at least two litres of it a day. I got a sugar rush from it - it was quite addictive.' Sharon lost a stone the first month after her operation and continued to drop the pounds, reaching 13st (right) By the time her sister Julie, 32, announced she was getting married in 2009, Ms Osawe weighed 25st and wore size 34 clothing. She said: 'I was thrilled when Julie asked me to be maid of honour. It took me hours to find an outfit which was in any way suitable, and even then I was very unsatisfied with it. 'Julie looked amazing as we drove to the church, but I felt as if I stuck out like a sore thumb in my huge suit. There were two other bridesmaids, but there were able to wear beautiful purple dresses. The change in Sharon's appearance is dramatic, having dropped from a size 34 (left) to a size 14 (right) 'My sister and I are close and it should have been one of my proudest moments, but it felt terrible.' It was only when the photos of Julie's big day came back that Ms Osawe realised how far she had let herself go. She said: 'The suit looked even worse on me than I'd thought. My face looked like it had been blown up with an air pump. 'I'd told myself I'd been trying my best to lose weight through fad diets but I realised I'd been in denial until that moment, and I knew that something needed to change. ' Ms Osawe was given a three-month subsidised gym membership after she appealed for help from her GP. She said: 'I was so big that progress was painfully slow. I found it really hard to stay motivated, especially while I focused most of my efforts on Austyn. 'I was starting to suffer from health problems including the onset of diabetes and osteoporosis in my knees, so I applied for a gastric band.' Ms Osawe finally underwent the operation in January 2012 at The Royal Derby hospital . She said: 'I was nervous before the surgery but once I had gone through with it, things seemed to fall into place. Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Nothing . Dinner: Two steak and kidney pies and chips or fish and chips with 4 pieces of bread and butter . Snacks: Six packets of crisps or pack of digestive biscuits, 2 litres of cherryade . Breakfast: Toast with marmalade . Lunch: A small cheese sandwich . Dinner: Beef stew and rice . Snacks: Nothing . 'I lost around a stone a month. The results were even better than I expected.' Before the operation Ms Osawe typically ate nothing for breakfast or lunch, followed by two steak and kidney pies with a large plate of chips or fish and chips with four rounds of bread and butter for her evening meal. She would snack on up to six packets of ready salted crisps or a packet of chocolate digestive biscuits throughout the day, washed down with at least two litres of cherryade. Sharon with her fiancée Kingsley and her sons Jamayne (in her arms) and Austyn (far left) Today, she typically eats toast with marmalade for breakfast, followed by a small cheese sandwich for lunch, and beef stew with rice for evening meal. She tends not to snack. Shortly after her operation she met her current partner Kingsley Osawe, 31, a field engineer, with whom she would have a son, Jamayne, born in November 2013. She has since officially changed her surname to his. She said: 'I put on around a stone during my pregnancy but as soon as I'd given birth the weight came off really easily again, so I never felt as out of control as I did before. 'I felt better equipped to be able to deal with the challenge of looking after my children and a new relationship because I wasn't so overweight. It was as if I was a completely new person. 'It feels amazing to be able to fit into size 14 clothes now. I used to hate shopping because there were very few shops which sold clothes big enough for me. Now I can shop anywhere I want.' Ms Osawe and her partner are now planning to marry in 2015. She said: 'I can't wait to wear a wedding outfit which actually suits me.'","At her sisters wedding Sharon weighed 25st and wore size 34 clothing .

"When it comes to buying a winter coat, British customers may have had the wool pulled over their eyes. New research has found that UK consumers could pay up to 60 per cent more for their coats this year compared with other European shoppers. International brands Zara and Mango, which were both founded in Spain, are among those accused of charging more in Britain than in countries such as Germany, Ireland and Spain. Scroll down for video . Retailers claim that higher taxes and rents make it more expensive to do business in the UK, pushing up prices, while Britain’s stronger economy means we have more money to spend. But experts claimed that brands have been cashing in on customers’ willingness to pay ‘a premium’ for popular labels. Zara’s profile has been boosted in recent years in the UK after its clothes were worn by well-known figures including the Duchess of Cambridge and Samantha Cameron. Foreign currency firm Caxton FX found a Zara draped wool coat costs 60 per cent more here than in Spain. Zara is among the stores which are charging Brits more for clothes than they do in the EU . A khaki duffle coat with a fur hood was 37 per cent cheaper in Spain and cost 22 per cent less in Ireland. A red leather handbag from Zara was 22 per cent cheaper in Europe, while flat leather zip-up boots were 33 per cent cheaper. Mango’s winter coats were also more expensive in the UK, with a faux fur coat costing 46 per cent more. Asda has launched a range of clothing for women who are dress sizes 18 to 32. The George Plus range was created after customers complained they struggled to find affordable, fashion-able clothes in larger sizes. The supermarket said its prices, which start from £8 for a pair of leggings or a top, are up to 65 per cent cheaper than its nearest rivals. A spokesman said: ‘All women have the right to feel beautiful in the clothes they wear without the fear of being judged.’ However, health campaigners criticised the store, saying that it had a ‘responsibility’ to help tackle rising obesity rates. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research agency Conlumino, said: ‘Retailers obviously want to charge as much as they can. In stronger economies, retailers can charge higher prices. That said, with the rise of online this has become more difficult because international prices are more visible.’ Mr Saunders went on to say that ‘the willingness of the UK consumer to spend on fashion’ and the strength of the pound against the euro were partly to blame for steeper price tags. But he added: ‘One of the issues with flexing pricing across different countries is that consumers are now more likely to pick up on this and differences that are too great can be damaging to the brand as shoppers feel like they are being ripped off.’ A Zara spokesman said: ‘Zara’s prices are set by individual markets to keep the same commercial positioning in terms of fashionable quality products at affordable prices. ‘These price-points take into account competitive local pricing, but also regional operating costs, such as rent and salaries.’ A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: ‘With a free- market economy, retailers rightly decide the market worth of their products and then price them accordingly.’ However James Hickman, managing director of Caxton FX – a specialist payment provider for foreign currency – said: ‘With the public increasingly aware of the great offers available online, they are now taking advantage of overseas bargains from the comfort of their own home.’","Spanish brands Zara and Mango among those accused of  Brits more .

"It is one of the most shocking tales of sexual extremism ever published – often banned for its graphic depiction of the rape and torture of young victims. But the original 39-ft scroll upon which the Marquis de Sade penned The 120 Days of Sodom is going on display to mark the 200th anniversary of the writer's death. The Marquis, whose name forms the root of the word 'sadism', wrote the masterpiece in just 37 days during his imprisonment for sexual deviancy and blasphemy in 1785. Scroll down for video . The original scroll on which the Marquis de Sade wrote the draft of his novel 'The 120 Days of Sodom' is displayed at the Letters and Manuscripts Museum in Paris . It was found when the Bastille prison was stormed during the French Revolution. And now it  is being displayed by the Museum of Letters and Manuscripts in Paris. Sade's work details the depraved behaviour of four wealthy French libertines who rape, torture and finally murder their victims in a remote mediaeval castle. It was described by the author as 'the most impure tale that has ever been told since our world began'. The story remained unpublished until 1904 when it was obtained by a German psychiatrist who regarded it having scientific importance. The Marquis (right)  wrote the masterpiece in just 37 days during his imprisonment for sexual deviancy in 1785 . But it has since been translated into many languages and is even studied in some French literature degrees. Feminist writer Andrea Dworking has condemned it as 'vile pornography' and described Sade as the embodiment of misogyny. In 1929, the scroll was bought by a member of the Noailles family who was a direct descendant of Sade. It was later stolen, smuggled into Switzerland and sold to a collector. A furious international legal wrangle ensued with a French court ordering it to be returned to the Noailles family. But this was overruled in 1998 by a Swiss court that declared it had been bought by the collector in good faith. It was first put on display near Geneva in 2004 when Aristophil, a company specialising in rare manuscripts, bought the scroll for £5.75million.

"As a young boy he watched as his mother  scoured newspapers for coupons to buy milk and bread to feed her family. But now, as one of the richest people in Britain and worth an estimated £60m, Mark Pearson said his poor upbringing inspired his success. Mr Pearson said watching his mother Julie cut out coupons as she struggled to pay for her young family inspired him to set up a discount site My Voucher Codes. He has been able to use his success to buy his mother a house, and now owns property in the Caribbean and a fleet of luxury cars. The entrepreneur was inspired by his upbringing, where his mother (pictured) collected vouchers to feed them . He describes his upbringing in Liverpool as a difficult one. On Christmas Day in 1992, when he was just nine, his mother took he and his younger sister to a women's refuge after a violent encounter with the man in her life. Mr Pearson's mother was left working several jobs to pay for her young family - a world away from his life now which he splits between properties in Britain and the Caribbean, complete with a fleet of luxury cars, . 'Growing up in Huyton in Liverpool, I had a challenging upbringing,' said the 34-year-old. Eight years after launching his voucher discount company Mark Pearson is a millionaire worth around £60m . 'Times were very tight. 'My mum was juggling single parenthood with working several, low-paid jobs. 'I remember we had to stay with my nan often because my mum worked a lot of jobs to make ends meet, including working nights in a petrol station. 'My mum had trouble making ends meet. 'It was hard for her financially, emotionally and socially. My nan saved vouchers on her fridge and watched every penny. Mr Pearson and his younger sister Alison (left) were moved into a refuge . 'I remember watching my mum scour the papers looking for coupons to cut out so we she could buy us milk and bread.' Mr Pearson said that after him and his mother ended up in the refuge he felt he should become a breadwinner, which drove him to achieve his success. He added: 'I felt that I was now the only man in the family, and that drove me. 'At nine or 10 I couldn't do anything, but over time I kept thinking, 'how could I be the breadwinner?' 'It all ignited a spark in me to do something, to be the breadwinner.' When he was 18, Mr Pearson moved to London to pursue a career as a chef and worked under Gordon Ramsay after being taken on as an apprentice at Claridges. After working in various restaurants in London and setting up a floristry business he launched the My Voucher Codes in November 2006 aged 27 after paying just £300 for the website. He started his business in humble surroundings - from a laptop in a one-bedroom flat in Croydon in 2006. He spent hours scouring news websites and magazines for vouchers from companies which he posted on his website. Soon he was able to secure payment from the companies using 'affiliate marketing' whereby he would receive a commission fee each time someone downloaded the voucher. In the first 12 months of trading he saw the website turnover £300,000. Mr Pearson, pictured at a wedding as a child, says his upbringing inspired him to create his business . Screenshot of My Voucher Codes, which was set up in 2006 and Mr Pearson just sold for £55m to Monitise Plc . Incredibly, in just four years the business earned an astonishing £10million and in 2011 he received the Ernst and Young 'Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year'. Eight years on from the launch he is a millionaire. The site, which receives more than a million hits each week, was so successful InterFlora and Flowers Direct, asked if he could advertise their vouchers. My VoucherCodes is a website which offers people deals on restaurants, bars, clothes and gifts . It works by allowing customers to select offers advertised on the site . They are then given a code, which can be used at online checkouts for specific stores so they can claim offers . The former chef is now a multi-millionaire . Mark Pearson launched MyVoucherCodes from his one bedroom flat in Croydon in south London in 2006 . In eight years it has grown to be used by millions of people . Monetise bought the company for £55m in June - eight years after it was launched . He said: 'I was thinking this is a neat business model. 'Unlike roses, I was suddenly selling something that didn't cost me anything to buy.. When he made his first million, Mr Pearson bought mum Julie her own house in Liverpool and one for himself and his partner, Arron Harpin, 25, and their two surrogate twin boys. He added: 'One of the things I was most proud of was my agenda – to give something back to my mum. 'One of my biggest purchases was to give my mum a house. The look on her face was indescribable. I think at that point I felt I had made it. 'I bought a place in Barbados three years ago. 'I just thought 'imagine you are running your business on a Caribbean beach in the sun' but I have only been twice. I've just been too busy to go back. 'But mum now gets to spend six months of the year in Liverpool, and six in Barbados. 'In Christmas 2006 I went home and I remember my step-dad, who is a great guy but always quite conservative, said to me 'well, enjoy while it lasts because it won't last' when I was showing him my charts and graphs. In June Mr Pearson pocketed tens of millions of pounds after Markco Media, the parent company of My Voucher Codes, was acquired by Monitise plc for £55million. He is now executive vice president of the company.","Mark Pearson grew up in poverty with mother cutting out vouchers for food .

"A Welsh model is preparing to try and win the same international beauty pageant that her mother competed for 32 years ago. Victoria Tooby, 20, beat 71 other competitors to win a heat in the UK for Miss International 2014, while her mother Caroline, 52, looked on with pride. The former Miss Wales, who now works as an accountant, took part in the same event in 1982 when she was 21 year -old. Victoria Tooby (left) is getting ready to compete in Miss International 2014 - the same competition that her mother Caroline (right) took part in 32 years ago . The ladies even share the same dress size at the pageants - with Victoria boasting an almost identical size six figure to that her mum had 32 years ago. After her win at the Palace Hotel in Manchester, Victoria, from Colwyn Bay, North Wales, will be heading to Japan to compete for  Miss International 2014 in November. When she returns to the UK, she will be heading to university to study law with the aim of eventually becoming a barrister, . Victoria said: 'It sounds really cheesy but I'm so proud to be able to follow in the footsteps of my mum. 'She competed at the Miss International event when she was younger and to say that I'm about to do the same thing is phenomenal. 'I never in my wildest dreams expected to win the Miss International UK event. Victoria Tooby won the UK heat of Miss International during an event in July at the Palace Hotel in Manchester . 'I was competing against the best people in the country - I never believed I had a genuine chance of winning. 'During an interval, my mum and dad told me how proud they were of my performance but I didn't think I'd done all that well. 'The next thing I was announced as the winner of the whole thing and I dropped to the floor. 'I started to cry because I was so shocked and overwhelmed - my stomach was doing back flips. 'But when it started to sink in that I'd won I felt absolutely incredible. 'I just hope I can make my parents proud in Japan and it would be amazing if I could win it after my mum came so close all those years ago.' Victoria's mother Caroline is seen here representing Wales in the Miss International beauty pageant in Japan, 1982 . Caroline (bottom row, third from right) with her fellow competitors in the Miss International 1982 beauty pageant . Although she enjoys competing in pageants, Victoria is keen to show she has brains as well as beauty. After studying English language, drama, theatre studies and history at Eirias High School in Colwyn Bay, she was granted a place at Oxford Brookes University to study law. Victoria said: 'I'm about to start a three year course in law at university because I'd love to become a barrister. 'It's completely different to the pageant side of things but it's great to keep my options open for my career. 'Competing at pageants has improved my confidence so much and I'll always enjoy the thrill of being up on stage at events. Victoria sports the sash and crown she won during the UK heat of Miss International 2014 in July . 'But I've wanted to be a barrister for some time now, so I'll be getting stuck into the books before travelling out to Japan. 'I'm just getting ready for a hectic few months but it's amazing to have two completely different things in my life that I enjoy. 'A lot of preparation went into Miss International UK, I stepped up my workout regime and started eating healthier. 'I practiced walking and also interview techniques and I'm having to do the same now for the Miss International competition. 'I'm definitely making sure I up my game and make the most out of the opportunity I've been given.' Caroline went on a tour of Japan with her fellow Miss International contestants when they visited the country in  1982 . Mother-of-three Caroline qualified for the Miss International competition in 1982 after being named Miss Wales in Cardiff in the same year. At the same time, she finished as a runner up at the Miss Europe event in Turkey and the Miss Intercontinental competitions in Colombia. Caroline said it would be a dream come true if her daughter claimed the top prize that she narrowly missed out on 32 years ago. She said: 'Victoria is such a confident person and I was ecstatic when she won Miss International UK this year. Victoria (centre) pictured with her mother (left) and a friend (right) after winning the UK heat of Miss International in July . 'I actually started to cry - I was that proud of her. 'It's extraordinary to see her getting ready to compete at the same event as I did just over 30 years ago. 'It really would be a dream come true to see her bring the crown back home. 'In some ways the events are exactly the same as they were when I did them. 'I won Miss Wales and was entered straight into Miss International but Victoria had to beat off competition from the whole of the UK before qualifying for the same event.' 'I'd love her to win the competition that I came so close to winning - it really would be a special feeling. 'Whatever happens I'll be incredibly proud of her.'","Victoria Tooby is heading to Japan to compete for Miss International 2014 .

"When Laura Dekker set sail on a solo trip around the world at just 14 years of age, some critics thought she would die trying. But the teenager, who was born on a boat in New Zealand, had the last laugh when she became the youngest person to single-handedly circumnavigate the globe in 2012 at just 16. Ms Dekker managed to brave 518 days of high and wild seas, long weeks of solitude, many sleepless nights and a number of wildlife encounters, including flying fish and a lone seal that decided to set up camp on her deck.

But her ambitious task didn't come without hurdles, despite the support of her parents. After word got out of her plans, Ms Dekker landed herself in the custody of Dutch child services, which sparked numerous court cases and global debate about parental responsibility. Her long-haul journey on board the 12-metre yacht named Guppy was documented and Ms Dekker has now published her daily account of life at sea two years after her feat . During her 518 day trek, Ms Dekker repeatedly anchored at ports along the way to sleep, study and repair her sail boat . Laura, who finished her journey in the Caribbean in January 2012, still lives on board her boat in the marina at Whangarei, north of Auckland . Remarkably, she said the court cases and dealing with harsh critics before she set off was actually tougher to handle than sailing around the world. 'I’m capable of sailing, I've been doing it for years. It's very natural to me. I only lived in a house on land for one year of my whole life... the rest I've lived on a boat,' Ms Dekker told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just wanted to sail but my dream became very well known – that was not my intention, so it made it difficult.' During her 518 day trek, Ms Dekker repeatedly anchored at ports along the way to sleep, study and repair her sail boat. She had two birthdays during her long haul adventure, including her 16th which she celebrated by eating donuts in Darwin with a balloon decorated boat. Laura, who has lived on a boat for all but one year of her life, started mapping out her route across the world when she was just 10 years old . She was given her first boat when she turned six and she hasn't stopped sailing on her own since . 'I was very happy to be doing what I loved. I met a lot of people along the way. There were of course moments where I missed my parents and friends, but not enough to turn around,' she said. 'The weather really decided what my day was going to be like. If it’s rough you’re really busy, but if it’s calm you have more free time... I did home schooling on the trip. 'Whatever you do it’s like doing it on a rollercoaster so I waited for it to be quiet to make food. 'I slept whenever I could. I had to keep checking on things and there are other boats out there… so I could only sleep for an hour at a time.'

Just a week after she finished, the then 16-year-old decided to sail across the world again to her birthplace of New Zealand. 'It wasn't about proving people wrong or being the youngest… It was my trip and I just wanted to do it. I didn’t really care about what people thought,' she said. Now two years later, Ms Dekker still lives on board her boat in the marina at Whangarei, north of Auckland. She spends her time giving motivational speeches across the world about her adventure and ferrying boats to various destinations. Ms Dekker, now 19, hasn't ruled out another around the world trip.

"Connah Smith, 20, of Brighton, East Sussex, 'stabbed a former colleague and her housemate, threatened to kill them, covered them in petrol and threw matches and told them not to call police for a day' A Sainsbury worker went online and searched 'what's the best way to murder somebody and not get caught?' before attacking and trying to set fire to two young women in their home, a court has heard. Connah Smith, 20, stabbed a former colleague and her housemate, dunked one in the bath, threatened to kill them, covered them in petrol and threw matches at them. Then when he left after the attack on Gabby Price and her housemate Megan Parsons, he allegedly said: 'Don't tell the police, give it a day. I want to have a good night's sleep.' The pair finally escaped their more than seven-hour ordeal when one of them pretended she was having a miscarriage. Mr Smith, of Brighton, East Sussex, is standing trial at Lewes Crown Court for the attempted murder of Ms Price and Ms Parsons. He had a platonic relationship with Ms Price, a former co-worker in Sainsburys, despite his wish to take things further, the court heard. The attack allegedly occurred overnight between March 29 and 30, at the home the two women shared in Dean Street, Brighton, when Mr Smith was 19. Mr Smith, a former Sainsbury's worker, has pleaded guilty to assault with intent to cause serious bodily harm, false imprisonment and making threats to kill against both women. But he denies attempting to murder them. Jurors heard how in the 'weeks and months' before the attack his internet searches also included 'how are most serial killers caught?' Other searched on the internet included 'stabbed in the neck scene' and 'evidence you would not expect to leave'. He had also viewed violent pornography, the court heard. Dale Sullivan, prosecuting, said Mr Smith met trainee nurse Gabby Price, now 22, while they both worked at the Sainsbury's in Brighton. He said their relationship was platonic despite his wish to take things further. On March 29, Mr Smith waited for Ms Price to come home from work shortly after 6pm, the court heard. He asked to use her toilet before dragging her into her bedroom and stabbing her in the legs when she struggled. When Ms Parsons, now 21, came home, he stabbed her in the head and neck, later holding her underwater in a cold bath using his foot. When petrol failed to ignite after he had doused the women in it and thrown matches at them, he allegedly said: 'Oh, this is not what happens in films. I thought it would be a bigger explosion.' The women's ordeal ended shortly after 3am when Ms Parsons pretended to have miscarriage and Smith let her call 999 on his phone before leaving the home. On leaving he allegedly said: 'Don't tell the police, give it a day. I want to have a good night's sleep.' A day earlier he was seen on the victims' street in a rented van holding a knife. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Connah Smith attacked both Gabby Price and housemate Megan Parsons .

"At least 15 people have been killed and dozens injured after the Taliban carried out two suicide bomb attacks in Afghanistan with minutes of Ashraf Ghani being sworn in as the new president. In the country's first ever democratic transfer of power - which took place after six months of bitter dispute and rows over electoral fraud - Ghani was sworn in as president. At a handover ceremony in the country's capital Kabul, Ghani formally replaced predecessor Hamid Karzai, who came into office following the 2001 U.S.-led invasion to topple the Taliban. But within minutes of Ghani taking the presidential oath, two bomb attacks left 15 people dead - the first at Kabul airport killing seven, before a second attack in Paktia province killed eight. Shortly after the attacks took place, the Taliban claimed responsibility for them, having earlier described the election as a U.S.-orchestrated sham. Scroll down for video . Swearing in: At a handover ceremony in the country's capital Kabul this morning, Ashraf Ghani (centre left) was formally named president. The event marked Afghanistan's first ever democratic transfer of power . Chaos: Minutes after Ghani took the oath of office, a bomb attack near Kabul airport  killed seven (pictured) A second attack - this time in Afghanistan's eastern Paktia province - then killed eight more people (pictured) The first bomb blast this morning - a possible assassination attempt on the new president - took place on the on the road connecting the country's main airport with the presidential palace. The roadside bomb did not result in any deaths or injuries, but a second attack about half a mile along the same road - this time by a suicide bomber - killed seven people near Kabul airport. A bigger attack then took place in the eastern Paktia province, with Police Captain Mohammed Hekhlas saying a car bomb exploded near a government compound as gunmen attacked, killing eight people, including at least four police officers. The second attack sparked a gun battle in which seven Taliban militants died. The violence and insecurity remained one of the top concerns of Afghans watching the inauguration. 'I hope Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai can bring peace and the rule the law in Afghanistan as former Afghan President Hamid Karzai could not bring peace,' said Abdul Rahman, a 30-year-old police officer. 'Our people have been suffering from the instability and poverty.' Ceremony: Afghanistan's new President Ashraf Ghani (centre) arrives for inauguration as president in Kabul . Setting aside rivalries: Moments after Ghani took the presidential oath, he swore in his election challenger, Abdullah Abdullah (centre) as chief executive . Outgoing: Afghanistan's former president Hamid Karzai arrives for the inauguration of the country's new president at a ceremony in Kabul this morning . The attacks took place within minutes of the swearing-in ceremony, which a senior adviser to President Barack Obama said would allow Kabul to immediately sign a long-awaited security pact permitting U.S. forces to remain in the country past the end of the year. Moments after Ghani took the oath, he swore in his election challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, as chief executive, fulfilling a political pledge he had taken to share power and defuse election tensions that had threatened to spark violence between the country's north and southeast. In his first speech, conducted as the suicide bomb attacks were carried out, Ghani called on the Taliban and other militants to join the country's political process and lay down their weapons. 'We are tired of war,' he said in a televised address. 'Our message is peace, [but] this doesn't mean we are weak.' Ghani, a former World Bank official and Afghan finance minister, wore a dark black turban popular in the country's south as he swore in his two vice presidents and then Abdullah. Abdullah, a former foreign minister, spoke first and thanked Karzai for his service and the people of the country for casting votes in the millions despite the threat of attack from Taliban militants who tried to thwart the election process. 'We are committed as one in the national unity government,' Abdullah said. 'Our commitment will be fulfilled together as unified team to create national unity.'

Ghani then congratulated Karzai for a peaceful and democratic transition of power, and he thanked Abdullah for making the national unity government possible. The new president also promised to confront the country's endemic corruption. 'We want to be held accountable. I am your leader but I am no better than you. If I make mistakes, you should hold me accountable,' Ghani said. The change in presidents will allow Afghanistan to sign a deal to allow American soldiers to remain in the country past the end of the year, according to John Podesta, a senior adviser to Obama. U.S. Ambassador James Cunningham is scheduled to sign the agreement, while it was not immediately clear if Ghani or a lower member of his government would provide the Afghan signature. The deal will allow about 10,000 American troops to stay in the country after the international combat mission ends December. 31. Karzai had refused to sign it despite U.S. threats of a full withdrawal in the absence of legal protections for American forces. U.S. officials have said that the delay in the deal's signing does not affect plans for next year. Another hit: A bigger attack then took place in the eastern Paktia province, with Police Captain Mohammed Hekhlas saying a car bomb exploded near a government compound as gunmen attacked . Scene: Eight people, including at least four police officers, were killed in the bomb attack in the eastern Paktia province. The second attack sparked a gun battle in which seven Taliban militants died . Karzai - the only president Afghanistan and the West have known since the invasion - wore a wide smile as he greeted his presidential guards upon entering the palace. Karzai has said he is glad to be stepping down after more than a decade of what the U.S. ambassador recently said was one of the most difficult jobs in the world. The inauguration caps a nearly six-month election season that began when ballots were first cast in April. A runoff election in June between Ghani and Abdullah stretched on for weeks as both sides leveled charges of fraud. The United Nations helped carry out what it said was the most thorough recount in its history, a count that reduced Ghani's vote percentage from 56 per cent to 55 per cent, but still gave him the win. But the real power struggle took place in marathon talks between the two sides, often brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and other U.S. officials. The political deal they agreed to created the new position of chief executive that Abdullah will now fill.","Deaths occurred during Afghanistan's first ever democratic power transfer .

"A British woman has died and an anaesthetist has been charged with manslaughter after performing a caesarean section while she was suspected of being drunk. The woman's first child, a boy, was delivered safely in France last Friday, but his 28-year-old mother was taken to hospital in a coma and never recovered. She died on Tuesday. The Belgian anaesthetist, 45, is said to have admitted to having a long-standing problem with alcohol and would carry 'vodka in a bottle of water'. A British woman has died after having a caesarean section in France, which has led to her anaesthetist being charged with her manslaughter (file picture) She is alleged to have inserted a tube from a ventilating machine into the patient's oesophagus instead of her windpipe. The patient was then starved of oxygen and suffered cardiac arrest. When questioned on Tuesday the female anaesthetist was found to have 2.16g of alcohol per litre of blood – the equivalent of four bottles of wine. The legal driving limit in the UK is 0.8g/litre. She faces a maximum of five years in prison. A French judge has put her under official examination – the equivalent in Britain of being charged – for 'aggravated manslaughter caused by the manifest and deliberate violation of the obligation of care and safety', The Guardian reported. Local prosecutor Jean-Christophe Muller said it became clear after the boy was delivered that his mother was in pain and required more pain killers. After more was administered the woman began having difficulties breathing and the anaesthetist put her on an artificial respirator, before she was taken to hospital. French prosecutor Jean-Christophe Muller said the woman had admitted drinking 'significant amounts of alcohol every day' and that she would carry vodka in a bottle of water . Mr Muller told the Guardian: 'During questioning she admitted she drank significant quantities of alcohol every day. She would carry vodka in a bottle of water.' He said the anaesthetist admitted she drank alcohol every day and that when she was called upon to assist with the caesarean, she had been at a concert and cocktail party. Mr Muller added: 'There are some very serious elements to make us think she had drunk excessively that evening.' Neither the anaesthetist or the deceased woman have been named.","A British woman, 28, died days after giving birth to her first child .

"Israeli rabbis have given approval to the creation of a series of high-rise cemeteries to alleviate the country's grave yard crasis. Architects proposed that multi-story 'artificial caves' would stay within the spirit of Jewish law while also allowing them to maximise space in such a densely populated country. The Yarkon Cemetery on the outskirts of Tel Aviv is the main burial ground in the city with 110,000 graves situated in its 150 acres. But under the new plan, 30 multi-storey 'caves' will provide an additional 250,000 graves which should be sufficient for a further 25 years. The Yarkon Cemetery in Tel Aviv is the first to develop a multi-storey burial ground to cope with Israel's grave capacity crisis . The new building is one of 30 planned for the cemetery and should provide enough capacity to last a further 25 years . The Israeli government has implemented new rules restricting the purchase of new traditional outdoor graves . Initially ultra-orthodox Jews were sceptical about the project but eventually declared the practice kosher and in accordance with their burial practices. Yaakov Ruza, the rabbi of the Tel Aviv burial society, a semiofficial organisation that oversees Jewish burials, said the new forms of burial have been endorsed by leading Jewish ultra-Orthodox figures. The towers, for instance, have pipes filled with dirt inside their columns so that each layer is still connected to the ground. In many ways, Ruza said the new types of burial represent a return to the Holy Land's ancient origins of burying inside caves and catacombs. He said: 'This is an artificial cave. Once they used to build a cave into a mountain. Now we are taking these artificial caves and turning them into a mountain.' Architect Tuvia Sagiv said: 'The source of all this is that there is simply no room. It's unreasonable that we will live one on top of the other in tall apartment buildings and then die in villas. If we have already agreed to live one on top of the other, then we can die one on top of the other.' Sagiv said the Yarkon Cemetery has been his flagship project and has completed the first of the 70-foot-high buildings. He said: 'It takes some getting used to, but it just makes the most sense.' The first of the buildings has not yet been completed. The Israeli plan is not unique as there are already vertical cemeteries in Brazil, pictured, Japan and China due to overcrowding . The Brazilian solution, pictured features a series of over-ground crypts where families can visit the space where their loved one is held . Cemetery overcrowding presents a challenge the world over, particularly in cramped cities and among religions that forbid or discourage cremation. The reality of relying on finite land resources to cope with the endless stream of the dying has brought about creative solutions. The world's tallest existing cemetery is the 32-story high Memorial Necropole Ecumenica in Santos, Brazil. In Tokyo, the Kouanji is a six-story Buddhist temple where visitors can use a swipe card to have the remains of their loved ones brought to them from vaults on a conveyer belt system. Versions of stacked cemeteries already exist in some shape or form in places like New Orleans and across Europe, in Egypt's Mountain of the Dead, in China and in the amphitheater-like Pok Fu Lam Rd Cemetery in Hong Kong. But the future will likely look more like the ambitious plan of Norwegian designer Martin McSherry for an airy cemetery skyscraper that looks almost like a gigantic honeycomb with triangular caverns. Other plans for cemetery towers have been presented for Paris and Mumbai. In Mexico City, another big project has been proposed: the Tower for the Dead, which will combine a vertical necropolis and an 820-foot-deep subterranean complex. Many cities have severe problems with overcrowded cemeteries such as the Montmarte graveyard in Paris . In Lebanon, the Bashoura cemetery for Sunni Muslims is packed to capacity in the city of more than one million people . Under Jewish law, cremation is prohibited so burial space is at a premium such as in the Washington Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York . The Washington Cemetery dates back to the late 1800s and is predominately used by New York's Jewish community . In China, Beijing residents have been provided subsidies to buy space in vertical cemeteries. The world's tallest existing cemetery is the 32-story high Memorial Necropole Ecumenica in Santos, Brazil. In Tokyo, the Kouanji is a six-story Buddhist temple where visitors can use a swipe card to have the remains of their loved ones brought to them from vaults on a conveyer belt system. But only in Israel does the phenomenon appear to be part of a government-backed master plan. Aside from those who have already purchased their future plots, individual outdoor graves are no longer offered to the families of the more than 35,000 Israelis who die each year. The first space-saving option is to put graves on top of each other - separated by a concrete divider - and have a shared headstone. This is common among couples and even whole families, and every new pit dug in Israel has room for at least two graves in it. The second option is stacking the dead above ground into niches built into walls, a bit like in a morgue, but adorned with headstones. The third, and most revolutionary option, is to be buried in a building where each floor resembles a traditional cemetery, without the blue sky above. For this upheaval to take off in Israel, though, the blessing of the rabbis was needed. Israel's rabbinical authorities oversee all burials of Jewish Israelis. The Jewish burial ritual is based on the passage in Genesis in which God banishes Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden: 'For dust you are - and to dust you shall return.' Jewish law stipulates that all bodies be buried separately on a layer of dust and earth. Jerusalem's burial society even has plans to dig an actual underground cave to find more room for the dead. In the Nueva Esperanza cemetery in Lima, Peru, locals have built their own version of the high-rise grave to maximise available space . In the City of the Dead region of Cairo, Egypt, more than half-a-million people live in the spaces between the tombs . Japan is another country facing a grave capacity crisis which has led to a high-tech solution in Tokyo with one cemetery using a conveyor belt system where relatives can order their ancestor to be delivered from the vaults automatically . Proponents say the new system is more sustainable, environmentally friendly and user friendly - providing a more comfortable visiting experience. But resistance has emerged from a public wary of change. In one famous case, a bereaved family threatened a cemetery official that if their loved one was put in a wall they'd put the official in a wall too. Shmuel Slavin, a former director-general of Israel's Finance Ministry who put together a report on the country's burial crisis, said there is no reason for such an emotionally fraught overhaul of an ancient tradition. He believes there is enough space in outlying areas, such as the vast Negev Desert in southern Israel, to build new cemeteries. He said technological advances could allow more burials in existing cemeteries, and that the new 'dead cities' will be expensive to build and maintain. But the bottom line, he said, was that people just don't want to be buried that way. 'People don't want to hear about it,' he said. 'There is a matter of tradition here. People want to be buried like their parents.' Officials say that those who insist on traditional burial will still have that option; they'll just have to drive a little further and pay for it. Cemeteries, they say, are not designed for the dead but rather for the living who want to visit them. The hope is that by attending funerals, people will be exposed to the new system and learn to appreciate its upside. Either way, burial officials say a growing number of people understand that change is inevitable. Chananya Shahor, manager of the Jerusalem burial society.'We are all in favor of burying in the open field so long as it does not infringe on our lives. So if there is no more room to build homes in Jerusalem, I prefer burying in layers. God gave us land for living, not for dying.' The National Cemetery in Port-au-Prince, Haiti is oneof the most severely overcrowded in the world . In New Orleans, pictured, most graves in the city are above ground because of the high water table. As soon as a grave is dug in the city it is soon filled with water and if a traditional grave is not reinforced by concrete the body can be pushed above ground .","Orthodox Jews have backed a scheme to build a series of high-rise cemeteries in Tel Aviv to cope with a grave crisis .
The first 70-foot-high 'artificial cave' is nearing completion and should have space for 250,000 new graves .
30 of the high-rise buildings are planed for the main Yarkon Cemetery in Tel Aviv with other similar schemes planned .
Experts believe the multi-storey cemetery will provide enough capacity for Tel Aviv for a further quarter of a century ."
"Former police officer Mustaq Patala was cleared of a string of sexual offences this month and now claims he was the vicim of 'institutional racism' by his former police force . A disgraced police inspector who had to quit the force for beating his wife and was later accused of rape is demanding a payout after claiming he is the victim of 'institutional racism'. Mustaq Patala, 39, lost his job in 2011 after his wife claimed he had subjected her to a  long campaign of violence which began in 1999 when she was pregnant. She told police he was a 'controlling individual' who became obsessed with the idea she was having an affair. But after his conviction - for which he got 180 hours unpaid work - police arrested Patala again and accused him of raping two women, allegedly telling one he was a police officer who 'could find and kill her'. Patala, a father-of-three from Blackburn, Lancashire, faced two trials accused of 14 charges of rape, three of sexual assault and another charge of perverting justice. But a judge at Preston Crown Court threw out the case earlier this month following legal submissions. Patala - who was once one of the youngest Asian police inspectors in Britain - has now vowed to take legal action against Lancashire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service claiming he had been a victim of 'jealousy' in the force due to his 'meteoric' rise through the ranks. He said he may need counselling after the stress of his trial and added: 'I do not think it should have ever had to come to this and I am going to commence proceedings arising from this court case in terms of the way it was investigated. 'Institutional racism exists profoundly within the police service. Whatever sense of justice I thought there was in Lancashire Police does not exist. I also rose through the ranks very quickly and there may have been people that were jealous.' He told local paper, The Blackburn Citizen that whilst awaiting trial he had spent time in prison and added: 'I had to notify the prison staff I was an ex-police officer as I might have come into contact with people I arrested. 'But the prisoners very quickly found out. I was kept behind closed doors 23-hours a day for protection.' After joining the police, Patala - a former school governor - was quickly promoted to inspector to oversee neighbourhood policing and was well-known locally. He had helped introduce reforms in the constabulary and his performance in police exams was said to among the best in the country. Patala was cleared of rape and sexual assault at Preston Crown Court (pictured) and now claims police failed to fully investigate the claims made against him . But his downfall began in 2010 when wife went to police to report a series of incidents. He was later convicted of assault after a court heard he attacked her and pulled her hair before her driving theory test and then threw furniture across a room. At the time, a then-33-year-old Patala said he was not old enough to cope with his rapid promotion to his £50,000-a-year post and claimed it brought about a 'wholesale change in his character'. The original list of charges alleged a decade of violence, but Patala admitted the common assaults in relation to two incidents and other charges were dropped. After Patala completed community service, he was was detained again on his return from a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia after two women came forward to say he had sexually assaulted them. A trial opened last year but had to be abandoned due to legal problems. A second trial judge then decided not guilty verdicts should be entered after a week of submissions. He says other officers were jealous of his quick rise through the force and the sex charges should never have been brought against him . Patala's lawyer Paul Schofield, partner at Farleys Solicitors LLP, said 'This has been a challenging and worrying case and my client had completely denied all charges from the first moment, and ultimately has been vindicated.' Explaining the case, a CPS spokesman said: 'After receiving medical evidence relating to the complainant in this case the prosecution applied to the judge to have the evidence given by the complainant in an earlier trial adduced as hearsay evidence in this trial. 'After hearing legal argument from prosecution and defence about this issue the judge refused the application and the CPS decided that in these circumstances it would not be appropriate to require the complainant to give evidence. 'We concluded that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction against any of the defendants and therefore offered no evidence at court. 'We take all cases of alleged sexual offences extremely seriously, however the health and welfare of alleged victims remains one of our prime considerations.' A spokesperson for Lancashire police said: 'While disappointed with the outcome we of course respect the decision of the court which we recognise has been taken in the best interests of justice and of the alleged victims. 'Lancashire Constabulary remains committed to investigating allegations of sexual offences, no matter how historic, and no matter what the role, position and status of the alleged offender, and we would encourage anyone who has been a victim to come forward safe in the knowledge that they will be treated sensitively and professionally.'","Former inspector Mustaq Patala left force after his wife reported beating .

A BBC Radio 5 Live investigation . found the illegal practice is now so prevalent there is even a . profitable underground market selling the ability to watch victims, who . are dubbed 'slaves', for a few pounds. More worryingly, paedophiles are using the technique to target youngsters – mainly girls – who have computers in their bedrooms. The technique works by fooling the victim into downloading a piece of software on to their computer. This . is usually done by sending an email requesting the user to click the . link to see a picture or listen to a song. Teenagers have been targeted . through internet links advertising diet tips or celebrity stories. Once . installed, the 'remote administration tool' (RAT) software allows . hackers to take control of the machine at any time – similar to how IT . workers fix office computers remotely. Hackers . can then use a victim's home computers as if sitting at it – doing . everything from switching on the webcam to looking through personal . files on the hard drive. A . 16-year-old from London called 'John' told investigators he had hacked . more than 100 computers – using the webcams to view the victims on about . half of them. He said: 'I wasn't really looking for anything, just their reactions. I'd open random sites [while the person sat at their computer] – shock sites – they'd see a scary picture or someone screaming, and you'd see they were scared. There are creepy people who post pictures of female slaves. I'm not really into that.' Called 'ratting', hackers can send out an internet virus that allows them access to a person's desktop computer or laptop without their knowledge . He added: 'Yeah, it is illegal. But the risk of getting caught isn't that much. It's just a bit of a laugh.' Matthew Anderson, 36, was jailed for 18 months after he was found guilty of infecting more than 200,000 computers with a virus that allowed their webcams to be hacked. The father-of-five, from Banffshire, Scotland, had watched dozens of women in their own homes, including girls as young as 16. He boasted to fellow international hackers he watched a teenager and her sister for hours and lamented how she had not got naked in front of him. Tony Neate, of the Government's Get Safe Online campaign, said: 'As more cases of “ratting” come to light, there is a serious need to educate the public about the methods hackers use to access the private lives of innocent people.' There is a range of ways to prevent being spied on, experts said. Covering the webcam with a piece of paper and installing anti-virus software will prevent most hacking attempts and delete RATs. Mr Neate said: 'The most at-risk computers are those running older software, and those without up-to-date anti-virus software installed.' The Association of Chief Police Officers said: 'Police have come across webcam hacking through cyber investigations. Any unauthorised intrusion into an individual's computer is an offence under the Computer Misuse Act.'","English student Rachel Hyndman thought police would laugh at her .

"A cafe owner left heartbroken at seeing a beach lying lost beneath a mountain of rubble bought it from the Queen for £1 - and then spent £100,000 turning it back into a sandy haven. Gordon Hadfield, 59, was appalled at the state of the beach, which had been left for 30 years as an illegal dumping ground for concrete and rusting metal. The cafe owner longed for the day when children could return to build sandcastles and safely stroll along the seashore again at Swanbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan. Scroll down for video . Back to its best: Gordon Hadfield builds the beach's first sandcastles since it was cleared in a £100,000 operation . Dumping ground: How the beach looked after being covered in concrete slabs and rusting metal over a 30 year period . But after negotiating to buy the site from the Queen's Crown Estate for just £1 two years ago, the real cost quickly escalated to more than £100,000, with a mechanical digger setting him back £30,000 alone. Yesterday, as people started returning to the beach, he said the project had been worth every penny. The grandfather-of-five Mr Hadfield said: 'I don't like to put a cost on it but my 60th birthday is coming up and I told my family all I wanted is for the beach to be cleared up. 'It was ruined 30 years ago - my cafe overlooks the beach but it was an eyesore with rubbish strewn over it from top to bottom. 'It has been hard work and in the past few weeks we have had to remove tonnes of rubble by hand. 'You would not believe what we have dug out, including metal piping and bars, reinforced concrete and all sorts of rubbish. 'It was a difficult job and cost a considerable amount of money - we did it when the money was available and we could afford it. 'I'm over the moon with it and so is everyone else.' Tia Spry, 7, makes sandcastles on the beach, fulfilling the dream of Mr Hadfield and a three-decade campaign . Gordon Hadfield at the beach, which cost him just £1 to buy from the Queen's Crown Estate two years ago . Mr Hadfield said: 'It's great for the area and it's great to see people fishing and using the beach again.' Mr Hadfield said: 'I have done this for my grandchildren and all children - that's where I will get my pleasure from.' He added: 'I have done this for my grandchildren and all children - that's where I will get my pleasure from. 'It's great for the area and it's great to see people fishing and using the beach again. 'Even though I have seen it every day I still appreciate that it's a fantastic area and we are fortunate to have it on our own doorstep.' The debris from a demolished cement works was dumped over Swanbridge beach when work was being carried out to strengthen a sea wall in September 1984. Vale of Glamorgan Council removed some metal bars from the beach but said it could not justify removing all the rubble at taxpayers' expense. Mr Hadfield, owner of the Seashore Grill and Cafe, said: 'It was just so dangerous for dogwalkers and children. 'One of our main concerns was to get the beach back to being safe so people could use it again.' 'But it was one of those things - if you want something doing then do it yourself. 'It has taken a lot of hard work, battling in all sorts of conditions, it was particularly hard on dark, cold winter days. 'But 30 years on it is fantastic to see the beach back to what it was.' Local paper the Western Mail covered the angry reaction in south Wales after the beach was ruined back in 1984 . Mr Hadfield spent £30,000 of his own money on a digger with the rest of the project costing him a further £70,000 . Mr Hadfield bought the beach two years ago but it has taken until now for it to finally be returned to use . Debris from a demolished cement works was dumped over the beach when work was carried out to strengthen a sea wall in September 1984 . Photos from before the clean-up show the extent of rubbish which had built up on the beach since the mid-1980s . Lis Sourlis said: 'I used to take my nieces and nephews to the beach as at one moment we had a beautiful beach, and the next moment they had dropped all this stuff over it.' Jeff Higgins - who helped clear the rubble - said: 'People are over the moon with what has happened here here. 'Visitors come from far and wide and say how nice it is to see the beach back to how it used to be and that they will be able to enjoy it again. 'I have lived here for 16 years and all that time I have had people saying we need to get the beach cleared so they could use it again.' Mr Higgins said that sand and shale would naturally return to the beach, making it look as though the flytippers had never been. Villager Lis Sourlis, who campaigned for 30 years to get the beach back to its former glory, said: 'It seemed like an insurmountable task. 'We lost 30 years of beach use because of what happened. 'I used to take my nieces and nephews to the beach as at one moment we had a beautiful beach, and the next moment they had dropped all this stuff over it. 'It is wonderful what Gordon has done.

"She once claimed her life contained too much too drama leaving her with little time to hit the gym. But looking at her new slimline face and chiselled cheekbones, it appears the contentment of motherhood may have encouraged Adele Adkins to re-assess her priorities. The award-winning star unveiled her taut jawline – a sharp contrast to the one she sported this time last year – as she enjoyed a rare night out without her son Angelo who will be celebrating his second birthday later this month (October 19).

The 26-year-old Rolling In The Deep star was at Hackney Empire in London on Wednesday watching a performance by FKA Twigs and emerged having wrapped herself in a warm oversized black coat and bright Burberry scarf. According to sources Adele is reported to now work out with a personal trainer, enjoys pilates and has given up smoking. Her lifestyle now is a far cry from the one she enjoyed a few years ago when she said: 'My life is full of drama and I won’t have time to worry about something as petty as what I look like. I don’t like going to the gym. ‘I like eating fine foods and drinking nice wine.’ The singer, pictured performing at 2013's Oscars ceremony, is reportedly earning up to £80,000 a day despite having not released an album for four years .

"Attack: Lord Judge said the way the Strasbourg-based court ordered Britain to follow its instructions was ‘a negation of the democratic process’ The European Court of Human Rights is a threat to democracy, a former Lord Chief Justice said yesterday. Lord Judge said the way the Strasbourg-based court ordered Britain to follow its instructions was ‘a negation of the democratic process’. Strasbourg demands, he said, meant that political decisions were left ‘exclusively to a body of unelected judges’. And Lord Judge, who retired last year as the most senior judge in England and Wales, said the campaign by the human rights court to impose its will on Parliament ‘represents a dramatic and unconstitutional extension of judicial authority’. In the strongest attack on Strasbourg made by a leading British legal authority, Lord Judge’s comments came at a key moment in the political struggle over Europe between the Tories and Ukip and at a time when Strasbourg is pressing the Coalition to heed the court’s requirement that Britain allows convicted prisoners to vote. Lord Judge, 73, has previously made measured criticisms of the court. But in an article for the Bar Council’s magazine, Counsel, he accused the court and its leaders of trespassing beyond the bounds of Britain’s constitution and the democratic practices that underpin it. ‘In any country which embraces the principle of democracy, and certainly in the United Kingdom, ultimate authority over constitutional and societal questions is not vested in a body of judges, however wise and distinguished, and even if the system for their appointment is beyond criticism,’ Lord Judge said. He added that the Human Rights Act did not give Strasbourg the right to impose its rule on Britain. ‘The debates in Parliament show that the suggestion that legislative authority should be given to the Strasbourg court to bind our courts here was expressly rejected,’ he said. ‘And if it could not bind our courts, it certainly could not bind Parliament.’ In 2004, the court backed claims made by axe killer John Hirst and ordered that Britain must overturn centuries of practice and allow at least some convicted prisoners to vote in elections. Lord Judge noted that the president of the Strasbourg court, Dean Spielmann, has said governments must change their laws when told to do so. ‘If he is right, whether or not Parliament agrees, Parliament is bound to enact laws which will bring the decisions of the Strasbourg court into effect. ‘In my view it would be a negation of the democratic process for Members of Parliament to be obliged to vote for a measure with which they disagree.’ Tyrannical: In an article for the Bar Council’s magazine, Counsel, Lord Judge accused the court and its leaders of trespassing beyond the bounds of Britain’s constitution and the democratic practices that underpin it . Lord Judge also pointed to a section of the controversial Article Eight of the code, which is supposed to guarantee the right to private and family life and says the right operates only as far as ‘is necessary in a democratic society’. Lord Judge said: ‘If what the President says is correct, what constitutes a necessity in a democratic society is left, in the ultimate analysis, exclusively, to a body of unelected judges, and has been removed from the legislative body elected through ordinary democratic processes. ‘The respect owed by Parliament to the views expressed by that court is embodied in the Human Rights Act itself. But, using the President’s language, the imposition of those views on Parliament represents a dramatic and unconstitutional extension of judicial authority.’","Lord Judge takes aim at court's insistence that convicts be allowed the vote .

"It may be more than 13,300 years old, but a spear made using the horn of a woolly rhino horn has been unearthed - and it is still sharp enough to kill today. The spear was discovered on the island of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky, off the north coast of Siberia and is the first tool from this era found so far north. It was was used by Palaeolithic man in the Arctic, and has been shown to Russian president Vladimir Putin on a recent visit to Yakutsk. Straight to the point: A spear made from woolly rhino horn, which was used by Palaeolithic man in the Arctic, is still sharp enough to be used today. It is almost 35inches (90cm) in length . The horn was uncovered by paleontologists searching for mammoth remains on the Arctic island. Semyon Grigoryev, Director of the Lazarev Mammoth Museum at Northeastern Federal University in Yakutsk, said: ‘This find helps our understanding of how far north people penetrated in the Palaeolithic Era. ‘At the same time, there are no analogues in the world for this discovery,’ he told The Siberian Times. The discovery was 240 miles (386 km) north of earlier finds of tools and implements of ancient man, at a site on the Yana River, also in the Sakha Republic. Woolly rhino horn is known to has been used in making spears, but the latest evidence shows it formed the weapon's tip, - almost 35inches (90cm) in length. Illustration of a woolly rhinoceros, pictured . It has been shown to Russian president Vladimir Putin on a recent visit to Yakutsk after it was uncovered by palaeontologists searching of mammoth remains on the Arctic island of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky. Lead researcher Semyon Grigoriyev is pictured left and President Putin, right . The spear was discovered on the island of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky, off the north coast of Siberia and is the first tool from this era found so far north. It helps experts understand how far north people penetrated in the Palaeolithic Era. The spear was probably used by ancient man to kill woolly mammoths and rhinos, demonstrating their considerable hunting abilities. Woolly rhino horn is known to has been used in making spears, but the latest evidence shows it formed the weapon's tip, - almost 35m inches (90cm) in length. It is first time we see that the tip - and such a long tip - was made of rhino horn. Experts believe that the spear could have been used to kill woolly mammoths and rhinos, both of which became extinct thousands of years ago in Siberia. Woolly rhino horn is known to has been used in making spears, but the latest evidence shows it formed the weapon's tip, - almost 35 inches (90cm) in length. ‘It is first time we see that the tip - and such a long tip - was made of rhino horn,' said Mr Grigoryev. ‘The woolly rhino's horn is rather hard, but flexible at the same time. ‘It consists of keratin - a substance that makes up our hair and nails. Deer horn or cow horn, by contrast, consist of bone substance.’ The weapon was dated as being 13,300 years old after analysis by Groningen University in the Netherlands. The spear was discovered on the island of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky (shown on the map), off the north coast of Siberia and is the first tool from this era found so far north . Mr Grigoryev expects other rhino spears may be found, and further evidence of early man uncovered on the island of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky (pictured), which is part of the New Siberian, or Novosibirsk, archipelago . Scientists say that stone spear points used by our ancestors 500,000 years ago, are comparable to bullets that expand on impact because they create large ‘wounds’. In August, researchers announced that they think that the use of stone tips had a large impact on human evolution because it allowed early humans to hunt large animals effectively. Experts tested stone-tipped and sharpened wooden spears and found that both had the same penetrating power. However, the stone point caused far more damage and was likened to the hollow-nose or ‘dum-dum’ bullet that expand on impact and are more destructive than regular bullets. The study involved shooting six stone-tipped and six sharpened wooden spears into gelatine and examining the degree of penetration and damage they produced. All were fired from a cross-bow with the same amount of force. Scientists found that the stone-tipped spears created a significantly larger and wider ‘wound’ cavity. Dr Jane Wilkins, of Arizona State University, said: ‘Hafting a stone point to the end of a spear was an important innovation that changed life for Pleistocene humans. ‘Humans with stone-tipped spears were more likely to kill the game that they targeted, and were able to secure high quality food resources more frequently and regularly.’ Mr Grigoryev expects other rhino spears may be found and further evidence of early man uncovered on the island, which is part of the New Siberian, or Novosibirsk, archipelago. The spear suggests that early Siberians were accomplished hunters. ‘Woolly rhinos were rather dangerous animals, and hunting them could be regarded as a huge trophy,’ he said. ‘The spear is also in one-piece, so it could be made only from the horn of a big, mature rhino.’ While woolly rhino died out some 12,000 years ago in Siberia, mammoth roamed the area until around 4,000 years ago. Experts believe that the spear (pictured) could have been used to kill woolly mammoths and rhinos, both of which became extinct thousands of years ago in Siberia .

"President Barack Obama bungled the response to the Islamic State and 'waited too long' to engage the terrorist group, the nation's 39th president, Jimmy Carter, said Tuesday. Obama's current approach to fighting ISIS in Iraq has a 'possibility of success,' Carter added, but only if ground troops do their part. Carter, a Democrat who served as president for one term in the late seventies, held little back when asked about the current occupant of the White House by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Former President Jimmy Carter speaks at a press conference as he takes part in the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project in east Fort Worth, Texas, by Habitat for Humanity, on Monday. In an interview at the work site on Tuesday, Carter gave a biting critique of Obama's foreign policies . Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, joined Habitat for Humanity and Trinity Habitat for Humanity, along with thousands of volunteers, in building twenty new homes in seven days in the Central Meadowbrook neighborhood of Fort Worth. They are pictured here yesterday preparing a siding board for attachment to one of the homes . The retired politician said he supported Obama's candidacy but disagrees with the way he's handled several foreign policy issues, including the ascent of ISIS. 'First of all, we waited too long [to get involved],' he said. 'We let the Islamic State build up its money, capability and strength and weapons while it was still in Syria. 'Then when [ISIS] moved into Iraq, the Sunni Muslims didn’t object to their being there and about a third of the territory in Iraq was abandoned.' Carter seemed skeptical that Obama's current plan of attack would yield the desired result. 'If we keep on working in Iraq and have some ground troops to follow up when we do our bombing, there is a possibility of success,' he stated. He did not indicate who should supply the soldiers, the U.S., Iraq or some other country. Ground forces are also needed in Syria, Carter said. 'You have to have somebody on the ground to direct our missiles and to be sure you have the right target. Then you have to have somebody to move in and be willing to fight ISIS after the strikes,' he explained. President Obama and his administration have already set to work on recruiting moderate rebels of the government to serve as the United States' eyes and ears on the ground in Syria. Before Congress left Washington for an extended recess last month, it authorized a weapons and training program for members of the Free Syrian Army. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told lawmakers that the effort would result in the training of 5,000 rebels each year who are capable of taking on the Islamic State. President Barack Obama walks back to the White House on Tuesday night upon his return from a set of high-dollar fundraisers for the Democratic Party in New York City and Connecticut . During his wide-ranging interview with the Fort-Worth Star Telegram at a Habitat for Humanity work site, Carter, who recently celebrated his 90th birthday, Carter also offered a negative assessment of Obama's policies in the Middle East more broadly. Part of the problem with Obama's approach, Carter said, is that it's been inconsistent. 'It changes from time to time,' he said. 'I noticed that two of his secretaries of defense, after they got out of office, were very critical of the lack of positive action on the part of the president.' Carter was referring to  former administration officials Leon Panetta and Robert Gates. Both of have released unflattering memoirs on their time working for Obama since retiring from government service. Panetta's book, Worthy Fights: A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace, was released just yesterday. In promoting it, he derided Obama in numerous times for not arming rebels in Syria sooner and for refusing to leave troops behind in Iraq when the U.S. ended its years long occupation of the country. Carter also noted his opposition to Obama's drone program. 'I really object to the killing of people, particularly Americans overseas who haven’t been brought to justice and put on trial,' he said. 'We’ve killed four Americans overseas with American drones. To me that violates our Constitution and human rights.' When it comes to replacing Obama in 2017, the year his second and final term will come to an end, Carter was slightly more reserved, however. 'It’s too early to speculate about the next presidential election,' he stated. 'I think Hillary [Clinton] is a real possibility,' he noted, but didn't give any clues as to whether she'd have his support in the primary. 'Whoever the Democratic candidate is, the Carter family will vote for them,' the former president said.","Carter, a Democrat who served as president for one term in the late seventies, openly disagreed with Obama on several foreign policy issues .

"Meet Nathan McClymont - the Aussie pilot who just might have the best job in the world. The 29-year-old flies helicopters over the breathtakingly picturesque Great Barrier Reef - the world's largest coral reef system. Life's pretty good for the commercial helicopter pilot, who's gained quite a following on social media for documenting his enviable lifestyle. Nathan McClymont is a commercial helicopter pilot in the Whitsundays from Hamilton Island - north of Brisbane . The 29-year-old, who previously worked in IT, says it's always been his dream to fly helicopters . The pilot spends time napping in hammocks and hanging by the beach . Mr McClymont left his job a year ago piloting choppers in Phillip Island, southeast of Victoria, in exchange for this . Mr McClymont was previously piloting choppers in Phillip Island, southeast of Victoria, but didn't hesitate taking up an offer at the Whitsundays from Hamilton Island - north of Brisbane. Who can blame him? Before that, he bid his IT job farewell to pursue his dream of becoming a pilot. 'I've always wanted to be one since the age of 10, he said. 'But getting a licence to fly helicopters is expensive so I wasn't able to get mine until I was 24.' For the past year, he's spent his time running charter and scenic tours for couples and showing them some of Australia's natural beauties. 'Everyone's on holidays here so we're all happy,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I feel like I'm relaxing all the time.' And it appears that Mr McClymont's 2,010 Instagram followers are living vicariously through him as he likes to share his experiences whilst on the job for Hamilton Island Air - whether it be in the air, by the water or simply on land. However he was too shy to admit that he had the best job in the world. For the past year, he's spent his time running charter and scenic tours for couples and showing them some of Australia's natural beauties . Mr McClymont says he's dreamed of being a helicopter pilot since the age of 10 . The pilot says he considers himself lucky because he loves his job . 'It's a good job and I'm living a pretty good life here but I'm sure there are better jobs than mine out there,' he said . Although he loves his current job, Mr McClymont has aspirations of becoming a search and rescue pilot . 'It's a good job and I'm living a pretty good life here but I'm sure there are better jobs than mine out there,' he said. 'But I'm really lucky because I don't sit here and complain about my job because I love what I do. 'There's no big downside to this job. The only thing is that we're living on an island so it can get a bit expensive. Sometimes you can also get a bit of island fever. So it's always good to take holidays to other places. Essentially take a holiday from your holiday.' So when Mr McClymont's needs a break from it all, he likes to go visit the big cities. 'I like to go back to Sydney or Melbourne because it's good to be back to the real world,' he said. 'Then again, it's not every day you get to sleep in a hammock, hang out at the beach and fly helicopters for a living and get paid to do that.' Having said that, Mr McClymont has aspirations of becoming a search and rescue pilot.","Nathan McClymont is a commercial helicopter pilot in the Whitsundays from Hamilton Island - north of Brisbane .

In the wake of the scare on the seas, Texas Health Presbyterian shared news guidelines it had issued limiting staff's travel. From now on workers will not be permitted to board planes, ships or trains for 21 days after entering a room with an infected patient. The New York Post, which reported the memo, said that enhanced monitoring will also be put into place, and staff can volunteer to be taken into care at the hospital if they want. On board: Passengers on the Carnival Magic, pictured, have been separated from the health worker, who put herself in voluntary isolation . Keeping on: Vacations continued for passengers aboard the ship, who were given a $200 credit to their on-board accounts, but had to miss out on a stop in Mexico . An administration official said the cruise ship had stopped in Belize but officials there would not allow the passenger to leave the vessel so she could be flown home. On Friday morning, passengers aboard the ship learned that they will not be making a planned stop in Cozumel, Mexico, due to 'a situation beyond the cruise ship's control.' The captain of the Carnival vessel made the announcement at around 10am saying that they are being forced to skip the final port on the itinerary and return to Galveston, Texas, Sunday. ‘We greatly regret that this situation, which was completely beyond our control, precluded the ship from making its scheduled visit to Cozumel and the resulting disappointment it has caused our guests,’ the Carnival Cruise line said in a statement to Miami Herald. A Mexican port authority official said the ship was denied clearance to avoid any possible risk from Ebola. 'It is the first time that this has happened, and it was decided the ship should not dock as a preventative measure against Ebola,' Erce Barron, port authority director in Quintana Roo, told Reuters . The company is offering passengers a credit of $200 each to their shipboard account and a 50 per cent discount toward a future trip. Explanation: This note was handed out to passengers explaining how the spat with Belize meant the woman could not be taken off the ship . The ship skipped a planned stop in Cozumel, Mexico, on Friday because of delays getting permission to dock from Mexican authorities over Ebola scare . A government official said that when the Texas lab worker left the US on the cruise ship from Galveston October 12, health officials were requiring only self-monitoring. One official said it's believed the woman poses no risk but health-care authorities want to get her off the cruise ship and back to the US out of an abundance of caution. There have been no restrictions placed on other passengers aboard the ship. Images from aboard the stricken vessel were published by The Denver Channel. Carnival Cruise Lines said in a statement that the woman, a lab supervisor, remained in isolation 'and is not deemed to be a risk to any guests or crew'. 'We are in close contact with the CDC and at this time it has been determined that the appropriate course of action is to simply keep the guest in isolation on board,' the statement said. The worker is being monitored for any signs of infection by the ship's doctor. An administration official said the cruise ship had stopped in Belize, but officials there would not allow the passenger to leave the vessel, which is now on its way back to Texas . The worker did not come into direct contact with Thomas Eric Duncan - the Ebola-infected man who died at the Dallas hospital on October 8. US State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said the worker joined the cruise ship with a companion in Galveston, Texas on October 12. 'The employee has been self-monitoring, including daily temperature checks, since October 6, and has not had a fever or demonstrated any symptoms of illness,' Ms Psaki said. The  cruise ship is carrying more than 4,600 passengers and crew. In a statement about company policy concerning Ebola, Carnival officials wrote: 'None of Carnival Cruise Lines' ships visit the region where Ebola cases are originating nor do our ships call in any countries with Level 3 CDC Travel Heath Notices. 'Any passengers or crew who have visited or traveled through Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea within 21 days of a cruise departure date will be denied boarding.' The Belize government said Washington has asked for assistance evacuating a cruise ship passenger who was considered to be 'a very low risk of Ebola' - but it refused because of the threat of infection. Mr Duncan, 42, was diagnosed with the deadly disease on September 28 after returning from a trip to Liberia. He died from the virus on October 8 . 'While we remain in close contact with US officials we have maintained the position that when even the smallest doubt remains, we will ensure the health and safety of the Belizean people.' The incubation period - the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms - for Ebola is two to 21 days, according to the World Health Organization. Caribbean countries on the Gulf of Mexico cruise circuit have been among the first to close their borders to travelers from Ebola hotspots, with four nations laying down bans. Jamaica has joined Colombia, Guyana and the Caribbean island of St. Lucia as countries denying entry to travelers who recently visited the Ebola-affected nations. Jamaica's travel ban extends to 'persons ordinarily resident in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone as well as persons who have traveled to or transited through Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, within 28 days of having departed from these countries,' the government said. Two nurses who treated Mr Duncan, 42, have also been diagnosed with Ebola. But both Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, were in a stable condition after treatment for the deadly virus. The latest statistics from WHO show that the worst-ever Ebola epidemic has already claimed nearly 4,500 lives, with the vast majority of the fatalities in the West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The passenger is a healthcare worker at the Texas Presbyterian Hospital where Thomas Duncan died . The deadly virus has also reached Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States but outbreaks have been contained so far. Ebola is spread through close contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat, vomit, feces, urine, saliva or semen. Those fluids must have an entry point, like a cut or scrape or someone touching the nose, mouth or eyes with contaminated hands, or being splashed. For this reason healthcare workers wear protective gloves, fully-body suits and masks. WHO says blood, feces and vomit are the most infectious fluids, while the virus is found in saliva mostly once patients are severely ill and the whole live virus has never been culled from sweat. Health workers in protective gear carry the body of a woman suspected to have died from Ebola virus, from a house on the outskirt of Monrovia, Liberia (pictured) earlier this month. The latest statistics from WHO show that the worst-ever Ebola epidemic has already claimed nearly 4,500 lives, the majority in West Africa .","A woman who handled the specimens of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan is returning to Texas after being on a Carnival cruise .

"You might think cold sores are unsightly. But they could also increase the risk of Alzheimer's, a new study suggests. Swedish researchers found an infection of the herpes simplex virus 1 - which causes cold sores - doubles the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The body carries the virus forever after the first infection, and it can reactivate now and then, causing the crusty blisters known as cold sores. Crusty: An infection of the herpes virus- which causes cold sores in as many as nine out of ten Britons at some point in their lives - doubles the risk of developing Alzheimer's, according to a study . While up to 90 per cent of adults have herpes simplex virus 1 lurking in their systems, only around a quarter of them will experience frequent outbreaks. The researchers say the virus could increase the risk of Alzheimer's because elderly people have weakened immune systems, which creates opportunities for the virus to spread to the brain. In the brain, the virus can start the process which results in Alzheimer's disease. Plaques are formed in the brain which result in the death of brain cells and the breakdown of the connections between them. This causes memory loss and the decline in the ability to think, which are the characteristic symptoms of Alzheimer's. Previous research suggests that people who do not get Alzheimer’s produce less amyloid - the substance which forms brain plaques - or are better at clearing it. Professor Hugo Lövheim, from Umea University in Sweden, said the study findings could be used to develop treatment for the disease. He said: 'Our results clearly show that there is a link between infections of herpes simplex virus and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. 'This also means that we have new opportunities to develop treatment forms to stop the disease.' He added: 'Something which makes this hypothesis very interesting is that now herpes infection can, in principle, be treated with antiviral agents. Experts said the cold sore virus could increase the risk of Alzheimer's as elderly people have weakened immune systems which allow the virus to spread to the brain more easily, where it can start the process of plaques forming in the brain which kill brain cells . 'Within a few years we hope to be able to start treating patients to prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease.' Professor Lövheim and his team carried out two studies to prove the link between an infection with the herpes virus and Alzheimer's. In the first study, 3,432 participants were followed for 11.3 years on average. They found that a reactivated herpes infection doubled the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. In the second study, samples donated to Umeå University's Medical Biobank were analysed from 360 people with Alzheimer's disease taken on average 9.6 years before they were diagnosed. The same number of samples from people who had not developed dementia were also analysed. Researchers found a doubled risk of developing Alzheimer's disease if the person was a carrier of the herpes virus.","Cold sores are caused by an infection of the herpes simplex virus 1 .

"A naked man who was acting erratically at an Atlanta airport gate was shocked with a stun gun and will likely face criminal charges, Atlanta police say. The 23-year-old man was at a Delta gate in the A concourse of the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Thursday morning yelling and acting strangely, police spokesman Greg Lyon said. The man, identified as Derrick Weems by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, did not calm down when police approached him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lyon said airport police were called to try to calm the man, but he kept yelling and an officer hit him with the stun gun to try controlling the situation without a physical fight. Lyon says the man was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital for a medical evaluation and will be charged with disorderly conduct.

"A Georgia man who moved all the way to Kentucky to meet a girlfriend he'd only known online in person was so upset by how different she looked in person he allegedly attacked her. Cornelius Jefferson, 33, is being held at the Laurel County detention facility. He faces fourth-degree assault charges. According to the Laurel County Sheriff's Department's Facebook page, Jefferson was arrested at 4:20 a.m. Tuesday morning. 'This subject had allegedly moved from Georgia after meeting this female subject on the Internet,' authorities wrote. 'The argument was allegedly because the male subject didn't think she was like she was on the Internet, and he allegedly choked her with both hands around the neck and threw food on her and left the scene on foot with two suitcases. 'Deputy Morris located the subject on Litton town road, nearby.

"Matthew Harries, 36, (pictured outside Southwark Crown Court) has been jailed for six months for the ‘totally unwarranted’ attack on motorist Justin Small . A police officer who launched a ‘totally unwarranted’ attack on an innocent motorist by getting him into a headlock and punching him in the face has been jailed. Matthew Harries, 36, stopped Justin Small on suspicion of possessing drugs outside Nando's restaurant in Acton, West London. He held Mr Small in a headlock, causing him to choke, punched him in the face and then kneed him using a ‘high degree of force’, Southwark Crown Court heard. Mr Small was left bleeding with swollen and bruised eyelids and swelling to the spine after the attack on April 5 last year. Harries later claimed Mr Small was holding his car keys in a clenched fist and he believed they could have been used as a weapon against him. He said the ‘worst case scenario was death with one hit’. However, a jury rejected his self-defence claim and  found the police constable guilty of one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm after four and half hours of deliberation. The judge, Mr Recorder Peter Kyte QC, told him: ‘You are a 36-year-old man now, you are married to a fellow police officer and you have a very young baby. ‘In your favour is the fact that this is your first criminal offence. ‘I also give you due credit for the fact that it seems that you have otherwise been a responsible and conscientious police officer of a period of 11 years. ‘I have read and I am impressed by documents which include testimonials from 11 police officers and three of your personal friends. ‘I note and take into account also the fact that there are no less than five commendations and obviously all that counts in your favour.' However, the judge also told Harries that the 'full picture' to be taken into consideration included previous complaints made by members of the public about his conduct. He told Harries: ‘It is pretty insignificant by comparison and your counsel has referred to those other matters as ""low level"" and they may well come into that category but the full picture includes a number of complaints from members of the public about incivility, intolerance and impoliteness. ‘The most important aspect of this is the fact that, at the material time, you were a police officer in uniform and this was, in my view, a nasty assault that the jury rightly convicted you of. ‘It was an unprovoked attack on a civilian who has consequently ""lost his faith in the police"". ‘I wholly reject your claim in evidence that at the relevant time Mr Small was armed with a car key which you regarded as a weapon. The attack occurred in the car park of the Nandos restaurant in Acton, west London (pictured), in April last year . ‘This in my view was an invention of yours in order to seek to justify your actions as amounting to self-defence. ‘It is you who placed his head in a headlock, as a consequence to which he started to choke and was unable to speak, according to his evidence. ‘He then went to the ground, your colleague was on top of him at this point. ‘According to the complainant, at this point one hand cuff at least had been applied to Mr Small and then you chose to punch him with full force to the face. ‘Again, I use his words: ""This was a totally unwarranted attack"". ‘Not content with that, you then kneed him to the same general area with what he described as a high degree of force.' The court heard how Mr Small was left nauseous and dizzy after the attack. ‘In all the circumstances it would be wholly inappropriate of me not to mark it with a sentence of immediate custody - it is quite unavoidable,’ Mr Kyte QC said. Harries was ordered to serve a six-month sentence and pay an £80 victim surcharge. A jury at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) found the officer, 36, guilty after four and half hours of deliberation . ‘That, in my view, is the least sentence I can properly impose,’ the judge concluded. The attack happened after Mr Small stopped to use the toilet at the Royal Leisure Park in Acton before driving home to Sussex. He found the toilet was busy during his visit at around 7.30pm and instead decided to use the corner of the car park. Harries then pulled up alongside him as he jogged back to his car and asked if he had been drinking. The officer went on to suggest that Mr Small was slurring his words and that his pupils were dilated, jurors heard. The court heard that the  officer then attempted to manhandle Mr Small, who sought to diffuse the situation by asking: 'Why are you being so aggressive?.’ After assaulting the ‘wholly innocent’ victim, Harries then bundled Mr Small into the police car and took him to Acton Police Station. When Harries was booking him in, Mr Small said he overheard Harries saying he could not remember what had happened. Mr Small was charged with obstructing a police officer and did not see a doctor until 3am. Described in court as ‘sick and emotional’, Mr Small agreed to a caution at the police station - requiring an admission of guilt - so that he could go home. The caution was later expunged and the decision  to prosecute Harries was made following an investigation. Harries accepted he had made ‘two rapid heel palm strikes’ to Mr Small’s biceps to try to get him to release the keys which he claims he was still holding. Harries held Mr Small in a headlock, causing him to choke, punched him in the face and then kneed him using a ‘high degree of force’, Southwark Crown Court heard. The judge told him the sentence was 'quite unavoidable' Harries, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was convicted by the jury after denying one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He had been placed on restricted duties pending the outcome of the trial. DPS Detective Chief Superintendent Alaric Bonthron said: ‘Where an officer’s behaviour falls short of the very high standards that we and the public expect of them then it is only right that they are held to account for their actions. ‘The actions of one officer abusing his position in this way can cast a shadow over the thousands of officers who are on duty right now demonstrating bravery, compassion, integrity and professionalism. ‘There is no place in the Metropolitan Police Service for officers and staff who do not uphold our values.","Police officer Matthew Harries attacked Justin Small in Acton, West London .

"Shameless water firms have been chasing customers in debt by using threatening letters from ‘invented’ third-party companies. The letters appear to be from an external debt agency, but are actually from the water companies themselves. The strategy is part of the psychological warfare used to turn the screw on customers with money troubles, by making them believe their debt has been passed to an outside company. Worry: Some of Britain's biggest water firms have been sending third-party letters from themselves (file photo) But the tactic has been condemned by consumer groups and MPs as underhand and potentially illegal. However, some of the water companies involved insist they are doing nothing wrong. Earlier this year, payday loan giant Wonga was ordered to pay compensation of £2.6million to 45,000 customers who were harassed with threatening letters from firms that it invented to chase debts. Subsequently, the head of the Student Loans Company apologised after it emerged the government agency had been using similar tactics. Recently, the chairman of the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee, Andrew Tyrie, condemned high street banks for using the ploy to turn the screw on customers. And energy regulator Ofgem has warned power companies that their use of third-party names for their own debt collection or legal departments was unacceptable. Research by BBC Radio 4’s You & Yours found that 12 of the largest water firms had used the third-party-letter ploy at some point. Demanding: Thames Water sent letters from 'County Wide Collections' - which is part of the same company . Five were still doing so earlier this year although this has now been reduced to two. Typically, the name of the debt collection company appears in large print at the top the letters sent to customers. Often the small print reveals it is linked to the water company, but sometimes no link is made. Thames Water sends out letters headed County Wide Collections, which is actually part of the company’s debt collection department. In the past, this connection was not spelt out, however the small print now states County Wide is part of Thames Water group. A spokesman said the use of a third-party name works and it plans to continue with the policy. He added: ‘We try hard to engage with our customers in arrears. ‘This is a long process, but our open and transparent letters do increase in severity. ‘When it gets to a final letter, we have found the use of an internally branded debt collection agency approach to be effective and cost efficient.’ Yorkshire Water has been sending letters to some customers in arrears under the name Rockford Debt Collections Ltd. It has changed them recently to include a statement in the small print that it is linked to Yorkshire Water. It defended the practice, saying: ‘Any customer who receives a letter from Rockford would already have received three letters from Yorkshire Water urging them to get in touch, as well as a text.’ Other water firms including Northumbrian Water, Affinity Water and Welsh Water stopped sending such letters this year. Citizens Advice condemned the aggressive approach. Chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘We’re not saying don’t pursue debt. Clearly companies are entitled to do that, but we are saying that they really ought to do that honestly and with some sensitivity. ‘These letters are about increasing the level of aggression to get payment. ‘They’re made on the assumption that people won’t pay rather than actually that many can’t.'","Research finds 12 of largest firms sent letters from supposed third parties .

"A woman digging foundations for a conservatory has discovered two headless skeletons in the house's back garden. Claire Wheeler was helping her parents with work at their home when builders found bones beneath the grass at the property in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. The remains, thought to be 150-years-old and of two adults, have been passed on to archaeologists at Anglia Ruskin University for analysis. Builders discovered the bones, thought to be 150-years-old, when digging foundations for a conservatory at the house in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire .

We were digging the foundations for a new conservatory and then we found these human remains,' said Mrs Wheeler. 'They haven’t found the skulls yet, which is a little bit worrying.' The house was built by Mrs Wheeler's great-grandfather in the 1930s and are thought to have been in the grounds of a Georgian house. Her father, Robert Russell, said: 'Huntingdon is a very old town, at least 2,000 years, it’s always been a river crossing and Roman remains have been found previously. 'We don’t think these bones are Roman but we know a house once stood were these two houses are today, there is still the Georgian wall around the area. 'I’ve spoken to the county council archaeologist and he said there used to be up to 16 churches in Huntingdon but there are no records of the site being a graveyard.

"Surprised: Shop manager Ali Iqbal, pictured with the black flag - inscribed with a Muslim prayer . The sinister emblem of Islamic State has already brought terror to Syria and Iraq. So when people saw a suspiciously similar-looking black flag being displayed in Walthamstow, they naturally were worried. Witnesses who called the police also reported seeing what looked like a gun on the East London premises, a dry cleaner’s shop. Two officers from the Met investigated, aware that eight years ago a cell of Al Qaeda supporters based nearby were involved in the liquid bomb plot to blow up airliners. However, their minds were quickly put at rest when manager Ali Iqbal explained that the flag was widely used in the Muslim world and had merely been pinned up to cover a hole in the wall – although his initial assertion that ‘the flag isn’t only used by IS – the Taliban use it as well’ was perhaps less than reassuring. Mr Iqbal also explained that the ‘gun’ was a BB air gun left over from the shop owner’s market stall. He was surprised that anyone had linked the flag, which bears the text of one of the central beliefs of Islam, to the IS jihadis bringing death and destruction to Syria and Iraq. ‘I’ve seen this flag before IS was created,’ he said. ‘The Taliban use it as well. And Pakistani tribal religious groups. You even see it on top of mosques or Islamic schools, madrassas. I’ve seen people waving them on TV too.’ Mr Iqbal, 30, who is of Pakistani descent but was born in Saudi Arabia and moved to London aged 14, added: ‘I’ve known Abdullah, the shop owner, for the last two years, and the flag’s been up all that time. ‘I don’t think there’s been any complaints until now. Police asked what the flag meant, and I just told them the wording. ‘I think the flag belongs to the Nation of Islam, not IS, but I am happy for it not to be on the wall.’ Proprietor Abdullah Abdur Rehman, who was busy minding his market stall on nearby Walthamstow High Street when the police were called on Wednesday, was also keen to deny supporting IS. Mr Rehman, 43, born in South Africa of Pakistani descent but living in London since 2001, said: ‘Somebody gave the flag to me two or three years ago as a gift at the Muslim festival of Eid, and we put it up to cover a hole in the wall. All clear: Police officers leave after enquiring about the black flag, hanging in the circled area inside the shop in Walthamstow, east London. The shop's manager explained it was widely used in the Muslim world . ‘I don’t like IS. And if people think it looks like the flag of terrorists, I have to remove it.’ The Met said: ‘It was found to be a flag that represents one of the five Pillars of Islam. This is not an illegal symbol. The proprietor has removed the flag from public view.’ The black flag mostly commonly used by IS fighters features a line of white text above a white circle which carries black writing.

"The traitorous Afghani soldier who gunned down three Australian army personnel in a 'green-on-blue' attack at a patrol base in 2012 is unrepentant, 'remarkably cheerful' and hopes to be released despite being sentenced to death. That's according to a new Four Corners documentary which has revisited the tragic events of the evening of August 29, 2012. That night, Afghan National Army (ANA) soldier Sergeant Hekmatullah, 19, killed Private Robert  Poate, Sapper James  Martin and Lance Corporal Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic with his M-16 rifle as they relaxed at Patrol Base Wahab, in the Baluchi Valley region of Oruzgan Province. Two other soldiers were wounded. In the interview, Hekmatullah also asks the families of those he killed to forgive him, but reportedly said he would kill again. Scroll down for video . Killed three Australian soldiers: Sergeant Hekmatullah 'seems remarkably cheerful for someone who's at least technically on death row' The Australian soldiers were playing cards at Patrol Base Wahab (seen in this ABC re-enactment) when they came under attack by Afghan National Army soldier Sergeant Hekmatullah . The rogue soldier opened fire on the Australian soldiers with his M-16 rifle and successfully escaped the base for Pakistan (re-enactment) While the rogue trooper is on death row at a prison in Kabul, the nation's capital, the country's government has not given the execution order. 'He is living in good conditions in this jail, he's put on weight and he seems remarkably cheerful for someone who's at least technically on death row,' ABC reporter Quentin McDermott said. 'When Four Corners interviewed him he was happy to talk about the incident and happy to talk about his hopes for the future.' After the attack, Hekmatullah fled Patrol Base Wahab for Pakistan. He was 'hailed as hero' by Taliban militants and spent around five months on the run until he was apprehended by security services in January 2013. Hekmatullah was sentenced to death by an Afghan court in December. Shot dead: Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate . Killed:  Sapper James Thomas Martin (centre) Murdered: Lance Corporal Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic . The temperature was stifling - over 40 degrees Celsius - on August 29, the day the Australian soldiers were attacked . Australian troops at Patrol Base Wahab were tasked with mentoring Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers . The rogue soldier told News Corp Australia in January he became enraged after he was shown a report about U.S. soldiers burning the Koran. 'There were some real nasty thoughts that I had in my head,' he was quoted saying. 'I saw that video and went crazy'. The ABC program comes as a Queensland coronial inquest last week examined the circumstances which led to the soldiers' death. Troops from both countries were present at Patrol Base Wahab at the time of the incident. The 24-strong Australian team had been tasked with mentoring ANA soldiers and ANA personnel had open access to the Australians. Parents of fallen soldier Robert Poate arrive at the Brisbane Magistrates Court for the inquest into the death of their son on October 15, 2014 . Suzanne Thomas, mother of soldier James Martin, is pictured attending the inquest on October 14 . Kelly Walton, the wife of fallen soldier Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic, also attended the inquest into her husband's death . Hekmatullah's attack came amid a spate of so-called 'green-on-blue' strikes by allied Afghani soldiers on Coalition forces. According to The Long War Journal, insider attacks were responsible for 15 per cent of Coalition deaths in 2012. Last year, the Australian Defence Force made public an internal investigation into the Patrol Base Wahab incident. Relatives of the killed soldiers  disagreed with its finding that intelligence failures had not played a role in the incident. The ABC report will reveal that secret orders circulated by U.S. military command warning of an increased threat of attack from rogue soldiers was not passed on to Australian soldiers. The full interview with Sergeant Hekmatullah airs tonight on Four Corners: The Enemy Within, ABC1, 8:30pm AEDT.","Sergeant Hekmatullah gunned down three Australian soldiers in August 2012 .

"Twitter will allow users to play podcasts, music and other audio clips direct from their timelines for the first time. The firm unveiled a new 'audio card'. It hopes the move will convince artists to debut new songs on the platform. The new feature allows users to listen to music directly from the twitter stream on mobile devices . 'With a single tap, the Twitter Audio Card lets you discover and listen to audio directly in your timeline on both iOS and Android devices,' the firm said. 'Throughout your listening experience, you can dock the Audio Card and keep listening as you continue to browse inside the Twitter app.' The new feature was designed in partnership with Berlin-based audio-streaming service SoundCloud. For starters, Twitter has promised audio from SoundCloud's partners, which include such diverse sources as NASA, the Washington Post, CNN, David Guetta, Coldplay and Warner Music. But it's trying to snag more content partners in future, Twitter said in a blogpost on Thursday. 'We’re just beginning to test the Audio Card and plan to make it available to more partners and creators in the future so that many more musical artists and creators will be able to share exclusive, in-the-moment audio to millions of listeners on Twitter. ' Twitter has promised audio from SoundCloud's partners, which include such diverse sources as NASA, the Washington Post, CNN, David Guetta (pictured), Coldplay and Warner Music.

'Many more musical artists and creators will be able to share exclusive, in-the-moment audio to millions of listeners on Twitter,' the company added. Twitter's new feature comes after rivals from Apple to Google  have jumped into the business of music-streaming, considered the fastest-growing segment of a music market dominated by iTunes. Twitter had reportedly been in discussions to acquire audio-sharing website SoundCloud, which has been called the Youtube of music, as far back as June.","Feature developed with Soundcloud .

"Elegant in a crimson coat and a matching tartan scarf, the Duchess of Cornwall was every inch the royal style icon as she welcomed HMS Astute back to port. The Royal Navy submarine has just completed its first tour of duty and has spent the last eight months patrolling the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. Camilla, 67, who last week joined the Prince of Wales at the funeral of their friend, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, was greeted by Astute's Commanding Officer, Gareth Jenkins, as she arrived at HM Naval Base Clyde. Welcome on board! Camilla is greeted by Commanding Officer Gareth Jenkins at HM Naval Base Clyde . All smiles: Camilla, who is Astute's 'Lady Sponsor', was all smiles as she toured the submarine . Once there, the Duchess, who is known by her Rothesay title while in Scotland, was given a tour of the base, before being invited to board Astute. Described by the Ministry of Defence as being 'more complex than a space shuttle', Astute is the first of the advanced Astute class submarines to go into service. Despite early teething problems, including an incident in which the £1bn boat ran aground on rocks off the Isle of Skye during sea trials, the submarine is one of the deadliest ever built. Carried on board the nuclear-powered Astute are 38 Spearfish heavy torpedoes and Tomahawk Block IV cruise missiles, the latter with the capacity to hit targets with 450kg of high explosive from 1,240 miles away. The Duchess, who holds the honorary title of Lady Sponsor of HMS Astute, has long been associated with the vessel and officially launched it in 2007. Camilla was also present for Astute's commissioning ceremony in 2010, when the submarine was officially given her HMS prefix and welcomed into the Royal Navy. The vessel was finally declared fully operational in May, three months after leaving the UK on her maiden voyage. Ambush, the first of Astute's sister ships, is also complete and scheduled to begin her maiden deployment before the end of 2014. Although she does, like Astute, have a formidable number of military uses, Ambush has no royal sponsor, but is affiliated with the city of Derby. Astute's home port, HM Naval Base Clyde, is also home to the UK's nuclear deterrent Trident and will also become the base for the remaining Astute class submarines, Artful, Audacious, Anson, Agamemnon and Ajax. Maiden deployment: Astute has been patrolling the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal since February . Advanced: Astute is one of the most technologically advanced submarines ever built in Britain . Powerful: The vessel carries Tomahawk Block IV missiles which can be fired from 1,250 miles distant . Like HM Naval Base Clyde, the Duchess is set for a busy few weeks, after it was announced that she and Prince Charles will embark on a tour of Mexico and Colombia at the end of October. During the visit, the royal couple will join President Santos of Colombia for a ceremony in capital Bogotá to remember the estimated 200,000 victims of the drug-fuelled war that has plagued the country in recent decades. In Mexico, the pair will travel to four different cities, including Real del Monte, a town that has close links with Cornwall and a taste for pasties as a result.","The Duchess of Cornwall was in Clyde to welcome HMS Astute home .

"Staying warm in the winter is often a case of piling on more and more layers. But one entrepreneur has found a new way to keep the cold weather at bay - by creating  clothes with built in 'central heating'. The Podz Gear shirt has six pockets which hold thermo-chemical packs over the body's major blood vessels, turning the wearer's circulatory system into a heating network. Scroll down for video . A Kentucky-based inventor has designed a shirt with heated pockets. Called Podz Gear (shown) it has six pouches that store thermo-chemical packs. The pockets are positioned in a way that a person's whole body is heated. Regular hand warmers can also be used in each of the pockets . It was invented by Kentucky-based Dwaine Evans who wanted to solve the problem of getting cold during paintball games without prohibiting his movement with bulky layers. The entrepreneur  developed the thermal base layer - which has reusable heaters on the shoulders, stomach and hips - which sells for £47 in the UK ($74.95 in the US). The product, which is currently seeking funding on Kickstarter, has six different pockets in which heat packets can be stored. Researchers at the Institute of Textiles and Clothing in Hong Kong have created a fabric circuit board (FCB) that could be incorporated into clothing for a number of purposes. One of these is the ability to create ‘smart bulletproof vests’ that could tell people away from the front lines that the person wearing it has been shot. And the team who made the fabric circuit board says it can be stretched a million times and washed 30 times with no detrimental effects. The team put some of the FCBs inside energy-absorbing fabrics such as Kevlar to create the smart vests. A bullet was then fired into the vest, and they found that the fabric circuits could register when they had been shot. This means that, on the battlefield for example, they could send a signal to a medic when a solider has been shot. According to the inventor, these evenly spread heat over a person's body, ensuring they stay warm in cold conditions. 'Podz Gear takes the place of multiple layers of clothing and keeps the user warmer while not restricting mobility,' the company writes on Kickstarter. 'Pockets are designed to hold thermo-chemical packs and are arranged along major blood vessels. 'This allows the wearer's circulatory system to use the blood as a heat transfer fluid. 'Using the blood to modify body temperature permits the wearer to maintain their appendage and core body temperature and enhance their tolerance of otherwise uncomfortable or dangerous temperatures.' The top is available in green, blue, red or black, while the thermal insets can also be replaced by hand warmers bought from garages and supermarkets. However, the company adds that for every 30 minutes the heat packets are used, they should be taken out for five minutes to prevent the clothing overheating. They also add that those with sensitive skin should keep the heat packets in for less time. The top is available in green, blue, red or black, while the thermal insets can also be replaced by hand warmers bought from garages and supermarkets. The pockets are designed to dissipate heat evenly around a person's body (illustration shown) and keep them warm in all circumstances . The £47 ($74.95) product is currently part of a Kickstarter campaign. 'Podz Gear takes the place of multiple layers of clothing and keeps the user warmer while not restricting mobility,' the company writes on Kickstarter. 'Pockets are designed to hold thermo-chemical packs and are arranged along major blood vessels' Wearing the shirt against your skin with no layer underneath keeps the heat packs as close as possible to your body (illustrated). This allows them to transfer heat to your arteries and veins, which can then be circulated around your body in cold weather .","Kentucky-based inventor has designed a shirt with heated pockets .

"Doctors have treated the first case of Google Glass addiction. An unnamed man, a 31-year-old US navy serviceman, admitted he wore the smart specs for 18 hours a day, removing them only to sleep and wash. He admitted feeling irritable and argumentative when he wasn't wearing Glass, and that he also wore it in his dreams. Scroll down for video . Google founder Sergey Brin (L) and designer Diane von Furstenberg wearing Google's Glass. Now the first owner has been treated for his addiction to his device after he started to wear it in his dreams. Internet addiction disorder (IAD) is characterized by the problematic use of online video games, computer use, and mobile handheld devices. While not officially a clinical diagnosis, individuals with IAD manifest severe emotional, social, and mental dysfunction in multiple areas of daily activities due to their problematic use of technology and the internet. The man had been using Google's technology for around 18 hours a day – removing it only to sleep and wash – and complained of feeling irritable and argumentative when doctors took his Glass away. In the two months since he bought the device, he had also begun experiencing his dreams as if viewed through the device's small grey window. 'During his residential treatment program at the Navy's Substance Abuse and Recovery Program (SARP) for alcohol use disorder, it was noted that the patient exhibited significant frustration and irritability related to not being able to use his Google Glass,' the doctors wrote in the journal Addictive Behaviours. 'The patient exhibited a notable, nearly involuntary movement of the right hand up to his temple area and tapping it with his forefinger. 'He reported that if he had been prevented from wearing the device while at work, he would become extremely irritable and argumentative.' However,the man also had other problems. 'The patient has a history of a mood disorder most consistent with a substance induced hypomania overlaying a depressive disorder, anxiety disorder with characteristics of social phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder, and severe alcohol and tobacco use disorders.' The patient was admitted for a 35 day residential programme to beat his Glass addiction. 'Over the course of his 35-day residential treatment, the patient noted a reduction in irritability, reduction in motor movements to his temple to turn on the device, and improvements in his short-term memory and clarity of thought processes. The man had been using the technology for around 18 hours a day – removing it only to sleep and wash . 'He continued to intermittently experience dreams as if looking through the device. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of IAD involving problematic use of Google Glass.' Internet addiction disorder was not included as a clinical diagnosis in the 2013 update to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the official reference guide to the field, and many researchers maintain that its effects are merely symptoms of other psychological problems. There's nothing inherently bad about Google Glass,' Doan told The Guardian. 'It's just that there is very little time between these rushes. 'So for an individual who's looking to escape, for an individual who has underlying mental dysregulation, for people with a predisposition for addiction, technology provides a very convenient way to access these rushes. 'And the danger with wearable technology is that you're allowed to be almost constantly in the closet, while appearing like you're present in the moment.'","Males patient of Glass for 18 hours a day .

"Her mouth frozen in a rictus grin and her eyes blue and staring, the new waxwork of Spain's eight-year-old Princess Leonor is unusual to say the least. And the sculptures created of her parents, King Felipe and Queen Letizia, which were unveiled by the Wax Museum in Madrid this week are little better. While Felipe's is without the salt and pepper beard that he has sported since the summer, Letizia's bears little resemblance to the royal original. Not so good: The Wax Museum's sculptures bear little resemblance to King Felipe and Queen Letizia . Unrecognisable: The creepy waxwork of Princess Leonor is a world away from the angelic-looking real thing . But the Spanish royals aren't the only ones to find themselves on the receiving end of wax tributes that look little like the real thing. Prince Harry, who now boasts an updated and considerably more lifelike waxwork at Madame Tussaud's in London, was, until recently, another victim of a royal waxwork disaster. Not only did the sculpture boast hair that was noticeably lighter than the real Harry's copper hue, the wax figure also looked considerably more like Barbie's boyfriend Ken than the prince. Other bizarre royal sculptures include the terrifying take on the Duchess of Cornwall that once graced Madame Tussaud's and a bizarre rendering of the Prince of Wales that looked more like a Spitting Image puppet than the royal himself. Bizarre: Queen Letizia's creepy waxwork boasts staring eyes and an oddly shiny forehead . Not quite right: The creepy-looking wax Felipe is missing the salt and pepper beard of the real thing . Family: Along with Felipe and co, the museum has made waxworks of King Juan-Carlos and Queen Silvia . Frightening: The Spanish royals aren't the only ones to be afflicted by bad waxworks as this one proves . Much better: The real Camilla is much prettier (and far less frightening) than her wax doppelganger . Is it Prince Harry? Or Ken! A terrible take on Charles (left) and a Prince Harry that looks more like a Ken doll . Much better: The real royals are both better looking and a little more rugged than the waxworks . One royal who has had no such problems with waxwork tributes is the Queen, whose Madam Tussaud's sculpture is updated regularly to ensure it looks as close to the real thing as possible. The current version was made to coincide with the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and wears a stunning silver lace dress embroidered with 53,000 Swarovski crystals. Another set of royals to boast accurate waxworks are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, whose likenesses entered the waxwork museum shortly after their wedding in 2011. Although the Duchess' smile does look slightly fixed, her long chestnut locks are spot on as is the dress, a copy of the blue Issa number worn to announce her engagement to Prince William. The current Prince Harry is also a good one, with the royal shown looking handsome in his military fatigues. Spain's Princess Leonor, whose waxwork is enough to frighten most other girls of her age, will surely be hoping for something similar in future. Who are they? Princess Diana and the Duchess of York both fell victim to terrible waxworks . Beautiful: Both the late Princess Diana and the Duchess of York are prettier on their waxworks . Big improvement: A new Prince Harry sculpture that looks far more like the real thing was recently unveiled . Good effort: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's 2011 sculptures are reasonably lifelike . No problem: The Queen's waxwork is regularly updated and wears a dress that boasts 53,000 crystals .","The new waxworks were unveiled by the Museum of Wax in Madrid .

"The 'legacy' painting by famed artist Eric Ravilious had been picked up at a house probate sale by the elderly collector, who thought it was just a print. She hung the work, featuring bathing machines on a beach, on the wall of her bungalow home in Oxfordshire until her sudden death earlier this year. Her husband gathered it up along with a mass of other prints which were then viewed and valued by art expert Sarah Lewis at JS Auctions of Banbury, Oxon. She almost immediately realised it was an original work by Ravilious, who painted 'Bathing Machines, Aldeburgh' in 1938. Eric Ravilious' 'Bathing Machines, Aldeburgh' sold for a record-breaking £312,700 at auction after a widower took what he thought was a print to be valued . The watercolour was one of a series of three he produced on a visit of the Suffolk seaside town for an exhibition held a year later. It was bought at the exhibition by a collector whose family owned it for the next 74 years until it appeared in the probate sale last year, when it was snapped up the wife of the vendor. Upon hearing of the discovery, Ann Ullmann, the daughter Ravilious, dashed to the auction rooms to view her father's painting for the first time. She described it as 'an absolute corker'. Art experts immediately realised the piece was an original work by Ravilious, who painted 'Bathing Machines, Aldeburgh' in 1938, and the masterpiece was quickly snapped up by a London-based art dealer (file pictures) The widower said he was 'blown away' by the final hammer price of £265,000 for the painting, before fees were added (file pictures) The vendor, who is aged in his 70s, was astonished when told it was to be given a pre-sale estimate of £40,000 to £60,000 and was 'blown away and speechless' by the final hammer price of £265,000. With all the fees added on the overall price paid for the 16ins by 20ins work was £312,700. It was bought by a London-based buyer. The sum is a record for a work by Ravilious. Joe Smith, of JS Auctions, said: 'The vendor's wife bought it at the end of last year from a deceased estate and hung it on her wall. 'She assumed it to be a print and paid very, very little for it, under £100. 'As soon as our valuer saw it she said it was the real deal. The paint was still visible under a glass and the original gallery label from 1939 was still on the back. 'The vendor was astonished how much it might be worth. I spoke to him after the sale and he couldn't say very much, I think he was blown away by it. 'It's a bit like a lottery win. He isn't a big, flash person and I would think he will share the money among his family. It is a nice legacy of his wife's passion of art.' Eric Ravilious served as a war artist until his death in 1942, in this piece, Night Operations, he depicts coastal defences of Eastbourne . Eric Ravilious, from Acton, west London, was a respected artist who had the ability to capture light like no other painter. Eric William Ravilious (22 July 1903- 2 September 1942) was an British watercolour painter, designer, book illustrator and wood engraver. His early work depicts the  countryside and urban London scenes. He is renowned for capturing a sense of 'Englishness' that existed between the wars. He also designed a number of popular pieces for Wedgwood between 1936 and 1940 including a Coronation mug for Edward VIII which was adapted for that of George V. He later became an official war artist in World War II and received a commission as a Captain in the Royal Marines. He was killed in 1942, aged 39, while accompanying a Royal Air Force rescue mission off Iceland that failed to return to its base. He studied in Florence and taught at the Royal College of Art and painted ceramic designs for Wedgewood. He went on to create watercolour paintings of English landscapes but was not prolific which is why his work achieves high prices now. Ravilious became a war artist in World War Two but tragically died in August 1942 aged 39 when his Lockhead Hudson aircraft disappeared off the coast of Iceland. He left a wife, Tirzah Garwood, an artist, and three children, John, James and Anne. Blue plaques appear on the front of two properties the couple lived in in Hammersmith, west London, and later Castle Hedingham in Essex. Mr Smith said: 'He was a highly respected artist who was very much ahead of his time. He managed to capture shades and sunlight so well. He wasn't prolific, hence the high prices. 'His daughter, Anne, caught a train up here because she wanted to see the painting. She said it was an 'absolute corker'.'","His wife, who had a passion for art,  picked up the piece in a probate sale .

"A new mom is seething after a Texas hospital had her kicked out while breastfeeding her son as sje waited for the little boy's vaccination appointment. Erin Pena took to Facebook to blast the University Medical Center in Lubbock on Tuesday, who she claimed threatened to cancel her doctors appointment if she didn't move to a bathroom or private room the feed. The mother had been sitting waiting for her OBGNY for about an hour when her son became hungry - but was told to cover up. 'I said I had the right to breastfeed anywhere. (The receptionist) said if I don't stop she will cancel my baby's appointment. Furious: Erin Pena, of Lubbock, Texas, says that after refusing to move to a private room while breastfeeding her son at University Medical Center, security were called and she was walked out of the premises . Hungry: Pena said she had sitting in the waiting about an hour when she started breastfeeding her four-month-old son . Scene: Security was called at University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas, when Erin Pena confronted her doctor over being asked to cover up while breastfeeding . 'I refused and she canceled it, so I went to find the doctor thinking she would be reasonable and she wasn't. She was condescending, kept calling me ''honey''. 'I said, ""No one in the lobby even cared (that I was breastfeeding)''. 'She rudely said, yeah, they do, they just don't say it to your face.' When Pena became agitated, the doctor called security. Pena then left the medical center with the security guard. 'I'm so disgusted,' Pena said. 'My doctor even lied saying I was walking around with my breast hanging out, even though she never saw what happened. 'I was just sitting there in a chair. It was sickening.' UMC have since apologized for the incident, after word of it started spreading on social media. 'Sickened': Pena said she expected more from her female doctor, who delivered her son . Family: Pena and her husband speak with a local news station about what happened at the hospital . Taking responsibility: UMC spokesman Eric Finley apologized on behalf of the hospital, but maintained Pena was asked to leave because of her behavior, not because of breastfeeding . They told KCBD the hospital takes full responsibility, however does not agree with all of Pena's story. But UMC Representative Eric Finley says the worker was out of line. 'Our staff asked that woman to leave unless she covered herself up, which is absolutely wrong,' hospital spokesman Eric FInley told the station. 'We apologize to that mother and to all breast-feeding mothers.' 'The patient eventually went back to complain to the doctor. 'She was then in a place where she was not allowed to be, so she wasn't asked to leave because she was breastfeeding. 'But still, had we acted more appropriately this never would have happened.' Pena said that, above everything, she expected more from the female doctor, who is the one that delivered her baby.","Erin Pena was waiting for her OBGNY appointment at the University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas .

"A top fashion journalist has sharply critiqued the Kardashians' fashion line in her new book, comparing the clothing to cheap Halloween costumes. In Hijacking the Runway: How Celebrities Are Stealing the Spotlight From Fashion Designers, author Teri Agins recounts a 2013 visit to a Sears store in Yonkers, New York, during which she examined the Kardashian Kollection items on display. 'I rifled through the racks and pulled out a leopard V-neck dress with skinny straps that was a mini in the front and dipped down to floor length in the back,' she writes. Scroll down for video . Sister act: Kourtney (left), Kim (middle) and Khloe (right) Kardashian attend a 2012 launch event for Kardashian Kollection, which has been critiqued by fashion journalist Teri Agins in her new book . 'The print looked rubber-stamped on, and the fabric was full of static and thinner than a negligee; it had the quality of a cheap Halloween costume.' Ms Agins, a longtime fashion reporter for the Wall Street Journal, adds: 'Even if it had been for a Halloween costume, I would have rejected it as too tacky.' She also adds that clothing from the line that had looked untouched two weeks before was now surrounded by signs that said '50per cent off.' Kardashian Kollection: Two models pose in recent looks from the sisters' Sears fashion line . Ms Agins writes that the saleswoman told her Kardashian Kollection was a brand that 'typically arrived on the sales floor marked down 50per cent.' 'When I commented that the ""sale"" price reflected the true value of the shoddy collection, even the saleswoman couldn't disagree,' she continues. Kim, Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian launched Kardashian Kollection at Sears in 2011, featuring clothing, intimate apparel, swimwear, accessories and home goods.

Not impressed: Journalist Teri Agins (left) critiques Kardashian Kollection in her new book How Celebrities Are Stealing the Spotlight From Fashion Designers (right) Ms Agins says she had a similarly low opinion of the reality TV stars' offerings when she saw them at a launch event the previous year. 'If I had to grade on a kurve - the fact that Sears offered so little that was appetizing - well, then the Kardashians were C-.' However, Ms Agins initially had higher hopes for the line. In a recent interview with Elle, she said she was 'surprised how the Kardashian brand at Sears, which started out with so much promise, just kind of descended into really shoddy merchandise.' 'Apparently it’s still selling. Sears itself is a retailer that’s not that strong, so it’s kind of not surprising,' she added. 'But I remember seeing those clothes at the beginning, and I thought that they looked really, really cute.'","The Kardashian Kollection was launched by Kim, Khloe and Kourtney at Sears in 2011 .

"For those who are already married, most would know that organisation is key to planning a wedding and then there is the dreaded cost of a wedding. But a Sydney couple have decided not to worry too much about the big grand plan for their day, instead opting to stage a relatively casual affair with a pop up wedding. It was in Sydney's CBD that school sweethearts Annie and Isaac Ledley held their wedding ceremony which was documented by bridal blog Hello May.

Signing the wedding book : Annie and Isaac in their pop up wedding . The nervous wait : The couple had their wedding in a Sydney alleyway . 'We made sure there were no events around, and the restaurant in the alley was closed,' said Annie when they held their wedding ceremony in an alleyway . Equipped with giant-sized paper flowers, the pair took their group of guests to Angel Place, an alleyway in the city - unannounced and without the usual booking. 'It was actually my husband's idea, he wanted to have it on the Harbour Bridge but I didn't want to get arrested, so we scaled down and loved Angel Place,' Annie said. 'It's frustrating trying to organise outdoor weddings with all the restrictions. We took the risk, we like adventure and are always thinking outside the box.' Annie said they did not have to pay any councils fees for the ceremony on Sunday and they were done in about 10 minutes. 'We made sure there were no events around, and the restaurant in the alley was closed.' And the bride could not have been any happier with how everything turned out. 'It was incredible, amazing. Like a flashmob,' she said. 'Some people were quite concerned but everyone was blown away and everyone cried even the photographer, it was crazy.'

Getting ready for the big day - Annie (pictured) fixing one her flower girls' flower head piece . 'Loved the sandstone and all the hangings and the birdcages, public art work and the great space.' And the special event certainly became a spectacle for the rest of the public, some who stood by and watching as the couple exchanged their vows. 'A lot of people were like, what the heck..... they joined the back of the ceremony, tour groups, another wedding was taking photos as well, two policeman walked down and watched and just left,' she said. The unique wedding saw the bride wearing a vintage style lace gown, with iced blue tulle underneath by Atelier Altaari. 'I loved the colour, didn't want the usual cookie cutter dress.' 'It took a while to know what to wear but I met the dress maker three months before the wedding, so there was not much time.' All the flowers were from Annie's boutique Francis Floristry which incorporated a brightly coloured flower headpiece, with hot pink, and a cascading bouquet. 'I did all the floristry, reception, everything head to toe,' said Annie. The couple also got photos taken as they walked down to Circular Quay and had their reception at Ripples Chowder Bay which they traveled to by boat.

'When we first started doing it, I didn't think there'd be a wide appeal but week by week it is growing crazily,' he said. 'This coming Sunday I have seven couples, next May on the Gold Coast I am marrying 16 couples on the same day.' 'Some people want to get married without the fuss, it's a growing trend that's becoming popular but not for everyone.' He describes pop up weddings as a unique way to celebrate a couple getting married. 'It won't appeal or apply to everyone, usually find a place, time, date, it's simple, casual and not the big white wedding, like Will and Kate's.' 'Usually little down to the core and basics, relatable to people getting married.' And people it seems in Western Australia are relishing the idea and the need to have pop up weddings is becoming so popular it can be hard to keep up. 'WA gobbled it up, there's a lot of interest in Victoria, I'm too busy to get there, but there's interest everywhere,' said Joshua. 'People are getting married because they want to, it doesn't degrade the value of marriage, what happens on the day doesn't define them.' Pop up weddings are becoming a trend across Australia .

"When they're sleeping soundly the precious darlings look their most angelic. But one artist has managed to make a group of snoozing newborn babies look even more precious by dressing them up and positioning them for a unique photo shoot. Professional photographer Joanne Collins, 39, who is based in Sittingbourne, Kent, waits until the babies are in a very deep sleep so she can move them about without them waking. The heart-melting pouts and smiles, though, are all their own doing. Scroll down for video . The babies are positioned while in a very deep sleep.The heart-melting pouts and smiles, though, are all their own doing . The babies are so tiny and precious and the utmost care is required so they are safe, secure and content . Joanne specialises in capturing newborns posed as they slumber, and is an expert at handling them from a very early age. She says that it is best to photograph the youngsters at between just five to ten days, before they lose their foetal-like poses. The babies are seen snuggled into warm blankets and cushions, some adorned in cute woollen hats or cosy in baby baskets in the adorable pictures. Joanne says: 'I have truly been captivated by the world of photography since the young age of twelve. I began by photographing children and families, but my portfolio grew rapidly to incorporate newborn babies, weddings, commercial, fine art and more. 'This is one of my most favourite aspects of photography. Photographing newborn babies under 14 days is truly wonderful and sentimental. 'The photoshoot takes four hours and requires patience and true dedication. The babies are so tiny and precious and the utmost care is required so they are safe, secure and content. The first step in the four-hour photo shoot operation is to ensure they have a very full tummy and that the room is warm . The colour toning with the chosen props need to harmonise beautifully and the lighting must be perfect . 'This is fundamental to achieving the special and very cute poses. It really is an absolute honour and privilege to be able to photograph these little miracles. 'There are a few principals to photographing newborns. 'The first is to ensure they have a very full tummy and that the room is warm as the babies do not, at this age, like for their clothes to be removed. 'I use a special beanbag with plentiful blankets, as well as props, such as backdrops, baskets, hats and hairbands. 'The colour toning with the chosen props need to harmonise beautifully. The lighting must be perfect and the correct lenses and camera settings used. 'Specific newborn photography requires specialised training in order to understand how to manage and photograph the babies. Joanne uses a special beanbag with plentiful blankets, as well as props, such as backdrops, baskets, hats and hairbands . The joy experienced when the special poses are captured is second to none and I adore it like nothing else, says Joanne . Every parent is always so pleased that they went ahead with their photoshoot, the experience is unbelievable, she says . 'The first steps are to ensure the baby is in a very deep sleep, so that they are lovely and relaxed enough to position into the poses. Understanding the correct way to hold and soothe babies is paramount to ensuring they feel secure enough to sleep. 'These photos are really a once in a lifetime opportunity, as once they pass the 14 days they tend to be more awake and less fetal like. Five to ten days is the ideal time to photograph your baby. 'The joy experienced when the special poses are captured is second to none and I adore it like nothing else. I enjoy taking photographs that cannot be re-captured, making them ever more memorable and extra special for the family to relive over and over again. 'Every parent is always so pleased that they went ahead with their photoshoot, the experience is unbelievable and the pictures to be kept close to their hearts forever.

"Medicine balls, the fitness tool . as ancient as Hippocrates, have bounced, slammed, tossed and . twisted their way into today's trendiest workouts, fitness . experts say. The durable, versatile spheres, which can range from 2 to 25 . pounds (0.9 to 11 kg), fit into today's most intense regimes, . from boot camps to interval training. Alonzo Wilson, creator of the New York City fitness studio . Tone House, uses medicine ball exercises to strengthen and . condition, and to boost team spirit. On trend: Medicine balls, a fitness aid once endorsed by Hippocrates, are central to modern workouts again . He said the people who seek out his brand of extreme . athletics often find medicine balls less daunting than his . resistance harnesses or cords and ropes. 'They make people feel comfortable,' said Wilson, a former . professional athlete. 'We use them in partner throws, to hold . and turn, to touch the ground with. Slamming the ball down while . (jumping) in the air elevates the heart rate.' In a fast-moving workout, he added, the balls allow freedom . of movement. 'With a lot of machinery you're kind of stuck,' he said. 'But with the med ball you can run, jump, grab it, slam it and . hold it while not staying in one spot.' Daniel Taylor, the author of 'Conditioning to the Core,' believes versatility is the secret of the medicine ball's . successful trickle-down from elite athletics to everyday . workouts. Taylor, head strength and conditioning coach at Siena . College in Loudonville, New York, said at the most basic level . it is a user-friendly weight for people who are nervous about . weights. 'A push-up executed with a hand on a medicine ball will train . stability,' he said. 'Throw or slam it (from overhead or against . a wall), it can train power efficiently and well.' But novices should start in the lighter range, advises . Deborah McConnell, master trainer at equipment manufacturer Life . Fitness. She said the balls reappeared with the rise of boot camp and . small group training classes. Ancient drawings date the medicine . ball to almost 3,000 years ago, when Persian wrestlers trained . with sand-filled bladders. In ancient Greece, the physician Hippocrates is said to have . stuffed animal skins for patients to toss for 'medicinal' purposes. Gladiators used them to prepare for the arena. The last great medicine ball revival was in the early 1900s. 'There was a game called the Hooverball, like volleyball . with a medicine ball tossed over the net,' said McConnell about . the trend that started when President Herbert Hoover's physician . suggested his overweight patient use the ball to shape up. Chris Freytag, a health and fitness coach with the American . Council on Exercise, said the latest comeback spurred a rebirth . of other weighted balls. The medicine ball is like a heavy basketball and made to . bounce, she explained, while the slam ball is made to slam . without breaking and the deadweight ball is sand-filled and does . not bounce. 'Now it's this chic thing,' she said, 'maybe because it . feels more like playing. You're not going to toss a hand . weight.'","In ancient Greece, the physician Hippocrates is said to have stuffed animal skins for patients to toss for 'medicinal' purposes .

"One of the last cobbled streets in Lancashire is being covered with Tarmac, after a 30-year battle by residents. The rectangular smooth 'setts' on Wellfield Road, Blackburn, have lasted 130 years but are now in very poor repair. They are now being ripped up after decades of complaints from residents, who say they are 'delighted'. Residents have been trying to get the cobbles replace for the past 30 years . The rectangular smooth 'setts' on Wellfield Road have lasted 130 years but are now in poor repair . Blackburn with Darwen Council has agreed that the stone paving will be dug up and replaced with a modern Tarmac surface at a cost of £75,000, initially paid for by the borough. Because the road is currently a private highway, the 42 residents will pay back between £2,000 to £5,000 each over 10 years, after which the council will 'adopt it' and pay for its maintenance and repair. Borough regeneration boss Maureen Bateson and Blackburn Local History Society chairman Ray Smith believe there are now just a handful of roads still laid with Victorian stone setts. Residents will pay back between £2,000 and £5,000 over 10 years, after which the council will 'adopt ' the road . 'Long overdue': There are now just a handful of roads still laid with Victorian stone setts . The rest have been replaced or covered over with Tarmac to accommodate the vehicles that have replaced the horse and carriage in the last century . Corporation Park Councillor Arshid Mahmood said: 'This is long overdue. The road is in a dreadful state. Though generally referred to as cobbles, the term is technically reserved for the medieval round small stones used to make highways, especially hilly streets - which were easier for horses to use. In the 19th century, cobbles four inches in diameter were used to make it easier for horses to get toe-holds. Cobblestones are nothing new, however: the Romans used paving stones as early as the 3rd century BC. Granite was used because it could be broken apart relatively easily, and wouldn't wear completely smooth. Tarmac came to prominence at the beginning of the 20th century, and cobblestones are now a rarity in residential neighbourhoods. 'Residents have been asking for this for 30 years but the problem was who paid. 'Two years ago, we asked residents to sign a petition and 90 per cent asked the council to act. It set aside £75,000 and then we had to get all the residents to agree to pay. 'After discussion, they agreed to pay between £2,000 and £5,000, to be reclaimed over 10 years. 'It will save them on car repair bills and add as much as £10,000 to house values.' Wellfield Road resident Ayyub Patel said: 'We are delighted. It's well worth.'

"The family of a 19-year-old woman who was allegedly shot to death by her soldier husband for being bought alcohol by another man has spoken of their anger after the suspect's bail was reduced. Skylar Nemetz, 20, reportedly fired at Tarrah 'Danielle' Nemetz in a fit of rage after finding out she had been given liquor by a man while he was training at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. The bullet struck the teenager in the back of the head, before passing through her skull and piercing the computer screen she was sitting in front of. Nemetz, who had no prior criminal record, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder following the shooting at the couple's apartment in Lakewood, Pierce County, on October 16. Scroll down for video . Couple: Skylar Nemetz (left), 20, allegedly shot to death Tarrah 'Danielle' Nemetz (right) in a jealous fit of rage after she was given liquor by a man while he was training at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington . He was originally jailed on $1million bail. But this week, his defense attorney, Michael Stewart, filed a motion to reduce the amount to $250,000, according to The News Tribune. In the motion, Mr Stewart submitted more than 30 letters from the soldier's friends and relatives, in which he was described as a good marine and husband. Now, Court Commissioner Meagan Foley has agreed to reduce Nemetz’s bail to $350,000, proving the soldier, who denies the murder charge, remains at the military installation until his hearing. The decision has sparked outrage among the family and friends of Mrs Nemetz, a native of McKinleyville, California, and former cheerleader at McKinleyville High School. Court appearance: Nemetz (pictured in court) was jailed on $1million bail, but now, Court Commissioner Meagan Foley has agreed to reduce his bail to $350,000 - a decision that has angered his wife's family . Stash of weapons: Photos posted on Facebook show a number of guns supposedly belonging to both Nemetz and his late wife. Foley ordered the guns be turned over in the event that the suspect posts bail . The victim's second cousin, Brian Shumard, told the newspaper that all of her relatives were 'furious' that Nemetz could be released, saying: 'What’s changed in a week? Forty letters?' Mr Shumard's mother, Vera, added: 'Even if it was an accident, she’s not with us anymore, and it’s all due to his actions.' And one family friend said: 'It just seems crazy that someone who killed somebody like that could be out walking the streets.' Following the shooting, Nemetz has given multiple accounts of what happened, including telling a neighbor that his wife accidentally shot herself while cleaning the AR15 rifle. Alleged murder: In a court motion, Nemetz's attorney, Michael Stewart, submitted more than 30 letters from the soldier's friends and relatives, in which he is described as a good marine. Above, Nemetz and his  wife . Happier times: Mrs Nemetz (pictured with Nemetz) was a former cheerleader at McKinleyville High School . Photos posted on Nemetz's Facebook page show a number of guns supposedly belonging to both him and his late wife. Foley ordered the guns be turned over in the event that Nemetz posts bail. Nemetz later admitted to investigators  that he had fired at his wife intentionally, but said the magazine was out of the weapon and he believed the chamber was clear, police said. 'Mr Nemetz said he picked up the AR-15, turned the selector switch from safe to fire and possibly shouldered the rifle and pulled the trigger,' deputy prosecutor Jared Ausserer wrote in an affidavit. 'He stated that he did all of this while the rifle was pointed at the back of his wife’s head. He provided no reason why he did this and said that it was a stupid thing to do.' Skilled with a gun: After he allegedly shot Mrs Nemetz, the suspect reportedly put the rifle in the closet and pushed the magazine under the bed. Above, a  photo on Nemetz's Facebook profile depicts another gun . Together: Following his arrest, Nemetz phoned his aunt from jail and told her: 'I love my wife. I love my wife' After he allegedly shot Mrs Nemetz, the suspect reportedly put the rifle in the closet and pushed the magazine under the bed, before dumping out a bottle of cinnamon whiskey into the toilet. He did not call 911. Instead, the authorities were alerted by a neighbor who had heard the gunshot and arrived at the scene, ABC reported. Following his arrest, Nemetz phoned his aunt from jail and repeatedly told her: 'I love my wife. I love my wife,' according to KOMO. Base: It is unknown when, or if, Nemetz will post bail. In the event he does, his 'chain of command' at Joint Base Lewis-McChord (pictured) will reportedly take safety measures to ensure he does not leave the base . One of Nemetz's co-workers told police he saw the couple two hours before the shooting, when Nemetz thanked him for bringing over liquor. The co-worker then said that it was another man who  brought liquor to the home while Nemetz was out, which reportedly made the suspect 'furious and visually upset.'

"Lukas Kamay arriveing at the Supreme Court in Melbourne where he pleaded gulity to insider trading charges that netted him almost $7 mllion . A former National Australia Bank employee who has admitted to stealing $7 million in an elaborate insider trading scheme will fight one of six charges laid against him. Lukas James Kamay, 26, of Clifton Hill in Melbourne's north east, pleaded guilty to six insider trading charges, but not guilty to the more serious charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime when he appeared in the Victorian Supreme Court on Wednesday. Defence lawyer Tony Isaacs told the court that Kamay would apply to have a permanent stay on the charge if it was not withdrawn. Kamay and a friend Christopher Russell Hill, who worked for the Australian Bureau of Statistics, allegedly worked together to trade confidential market-sensitive information that netted about $7 million in profits. Hill, 24, has previously pleaded guilty to six charges in the Melbourne Magistrates Court. Police allege that Hill, of Belconnen in the ACT, used his position with the ABS to access data on the labour force and retail trade to predict fluctuations in the Australian dollar before it was made publicly available. Kamay appearing at court on Wednesday has admitted to stealing money in an alaborate insider trading scam with a friend . Kamay, 26, and Hill, 24, both pleaded guilty to six charges in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday for insider trading . He then passed it to his university friend Kamay in Melbourne, who used the information to make foreign exchange derivative trades. In court on Wednesday, Defence lawyer Tony Isaacs said Kamay would fight the charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime. 'He has made full confessions, full admissions,' Mr Isaacs said on Wednesday. 'We simply say this is charging a thief with handling stolen goods.' Kamay and Hill are friends from Monash University and are accused of making net profit of $6.98 million over eight months between August last year and May this year by using advanced knowledge of government data. Hill used his position as Canberra-based ABS employee to allegedly give Kamay information about official data releases on jobs, building approvals, capital expenditure and retail sales. Kamay and Hill appeared in Melbourne Magistrates Court where they pleaded guilty to six charges . Hill worked at the NAB's foreign exchange desk . Documents tendered to the court show Kamay bought an Albert Park unit featured on TV show The Block for $2.375 million. Kamay allegedly offered Hill $50,000 to give him the ABS data and would use this information to 'predict fluctuations in the Australian dollar'. He would buy foreign exchange derivative contracts minutes before the ABS's data release at 11.30am and would sell them shortly afterwards.The men were arrested in May as part of a joint AFP and ASIC investigation. Hill worked at the NAB's foreign exchange desk Kamay, of Clifton Hill, worked for NAB in Melbourne on the foreign exchange desk but was not involved in derivatives trading, while Hill started with the ABS in January 2011 as a technical statistics expert preparing labour force and employment reports. After Hill was charged, The Australian Bureau of Statistics admitted it was difficult to counter the threat of a trusted insider leaking market-sensitive information. At a Senate estimates hearing on earlier this year ABS acting statistician Jonathan Palmer defended security protocols in place, describing the breach as unprecedented in the bureau's 100-year history. 'Fortunately in this case police were clear that this person acted alone,' he said. 'That gives me some level of confidence.' The bureau has recruited Belinda Gibson, former deputy chair of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, to conduct a review. Staff must sign undertakings and declarations when they begin employment to show they are aware they risk jail if they leak sensitive information. Mr Palmer said there were strict access controls on sensitive information and the bureau reviews access logs. They were granted bail to face a directions hearing in the Victorian Supreme Court on October 1.","Lukas Kamay appeared in Victorian Supreme Court on Wednesday .

"William Hague said Ed Miliband’s decision to vote down plans for strikes against Syria had ‘not helped perceptions of the West being ready to defend itself’ Labour's decision to block military action against Syria last year has ‘emboldened’ the West’s enemies, William Hague warned yesterday. The former foreign secretary said Ed Miliband’s decision to vote down plans for retaliatory strikes against Syria had ‘not helped perceptions of the West being ready to defend itself’. Mr Hague suggested Labour was now in danger of repeating the same error by demanding a United Nations Security Council resolution on tackling Islamic State (Isil) in Syria before contemplating action in the country. He said it was completely unrealistic to demand a UN resolution given Russia’s public opposition and said it would be dangerous to get ‘hung up’ on the issue. Mr Hague suggested ministers will now try to build the case for action in Syria before asking MPs to vote on the issue. ‘There isn’t yet a political consensus on taking action, but we haven’t excluded that,’ he said. MPs have so far only been asked to sanction bombing against Isil forces in Iraq, partly because of Labour’s caution over Syria. But a string of ministers yesterday suggested the Government could return to the issue of military action in Syria very soon. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told Sky News: ‘Isil is based in Syria, it has been attacking Iraq from Syria, and it needs to be defeated in Syria as well as Iraq. ‘We have not taken a decision on that yet. It is something we are going to review. We will see how that campaign goes, but in the end Isil do have to be defeated in Syria.’ David Cameron said he had ‘a lot of sympathy’ for the argument that Britain needs to be involved in Syria as well as Iraq, but said he had been constrained by the need to get a political ‘consensus’ at Westminster. The Prime Minister dismissed the need for British ground troops, saying: ‘We’re not trying to defeat Isil from the air alone. ‘We believe you do need troops on the ground, but they should be Iraqi troops, they should be Kurdish troops.’ And he dismissed calls to work with Syria tyrant Bashar al-Assad, saying he was ‘part of the problem, not the solution’. Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, was instrumental in organising parliamentary opposition to airstrikes against the Syrian government, led by dictator Bashar al-Assad, right, which has been fighting rebels including IS . Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker stressed that Labour supported the US-led air strikes in Syria, even though the party had set a series of further conditions before British action there could be considered. Mr Coaker said a ‘much more cautious’ approach was needed in Syria and said Labour would not ‘give a blank cheque to the Government’. He said it was ‘important’ to seek a UN resolution, adding: ‘We need to understand that it’s complex in Syria, it’s difficult in Syria. What is the outcome that we want to achieve?’","Former foreign secretary warns Labour is in danger of repeating the error .

"Welcome staff at Edinburgh Airport are using Google Glass headsets to provide flight information, answer queries or translate foreign languages for travellers, but a privacy watchdog fears the devices could be hacked or used inappropriately. Launched this week, the three-month pilot project offers a glimpse into the future of customer service at airports as management teams take advantage of new forms of technology. Edinburgh Airport is the first in the UK to use Google Glass, which is similar to a pair of spectacles and is equipped with an optical display. Flying into the future: Edinburgh Airport's welcome team is using Google Glass to assist travellers . The hands-free device displays digital information and allows users to access the internet or apps using voice commands or snap photos with just a wink. Until the end of the year, Edinburgh Airport’s welcome team, Blackjack, will be using the headsets to assist passengers with questions about their flights, the airport, the city itself or other topics. But privacy watchdog Big Brother Group is raising concerns about the use of Google Glass in airports, saying Edinburgh Airport management should think ‘very carefully’ about whether the device is appropriate. Emma Carr, the organisation’s director, told the Edinburgh Evening News: ‘The danger with Google Glass is that the camera is seeing what you see, all the time, while the microphone allows nearby conversations to be eavesdropped on. ‘It is impossible to guarantee against these devices being hacked, so it is surprising that this technology is allowed anywhere like an airport or government buildings.’ Wearable technology: Users can access the internet or apps with voice commands or snap a photo with a wink . Google spokeswoman Emily Clarke dismissed the group's claims and told MailOnline Travel that all of Google’s products have protections against hacks. She said Google Glass does not record a person’s every move, it does not pick up sounds around them and video recording is limited to 10 seconds by default. The recording time can be extended but the device’s battery isn’t suitable for long-term recording. She added: ‘Glass is also built with social signals in mind - it works through your voice or by tapping it, and you have to look directly at whatever you are recording, so it's clear when you are using it. ‘There are lots of devices you can use to secretly record things but Glass isn't one of them.’ Edinburgh Airport is the first in the UK to use Google Glass, which is equipped with an optical display . Edinburgh Airport chief executive Gordon Dewar said in a statement: ‘We’re always looking for new and innovative ways to improve the airport experience for our passengers and Google Glass trial is a great example of how we’re thinking out the box. ‘The fact that it’s the first trial of its kind in a Scottish airport is exciting as it shows we’re leading the way in how we interact with our passengers. 'Over the next few months we’ll be able to establish whether this product is suitable for an airport environment.’ Privacy watchdog Big Brother Group said it is 'surprising' that the technology is being used at an airport . The trial is part of a partnership the UK's fifth largest airport and Omniserv Ltd, the parent company of Blackjack. A handful of airports or airlines have tested Google Glass to determine if it is useful to them. Virgin Atlantic launched a six-week pilot scheme at Heathrow Airport last February, while a trial has taken place at Copenhagen Airport.","Google Glass headsets are being used by the airport's welcome team .

"Ian Watkins was jailed for 35 years for a string of sex offences. The IPCC is now investigating claims police failed to take action on reports about him . Eight police officers are being investigated over claims they failed to take action to stop paedophile rockstar Ian Watkins, it emerged today. The officers from three separate forces across Britain are being probed after claims some of them were told about the Lostprophets frontman before he attempted to rape a baby. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is now looking into reports police failed to act on the information. The watchdog is investigating South Wales Police - who cover Watkins' home town of Pontypridd. They are also looking at South Yorkshire Police and Bedfordshire Police, who cover the home area of two women said to have 'offered' their children to Watkins. The IPCC have already served notices on three South Yorkshire Police officers - one sergeant and two police constables - advising them that their conduct is subject to investigation. A fourth officer - another constable at South Yorkshire Police - has now been served with a misconduct notice. The officers are being investigated after complaints about the handling of three reports made to the force between March and May 2012 which contained 'potential evidence'. A sergeant and a constable at Bedfordshire Police are also being probed over their 'handling of information from a member of the public' in October 2012. A detective constable from South Wales Police's Child Protection Unit is also being investigated. Another detective sergeant in South Wales has already been served with a gross misconduct notice and removed from frontline duty. Announcing the investigation into the latest officer, a spokesman for the watchdog said: 'The IPCC has served a misconduct notice on a South Yorkshire Police constable as part of its ongoing investigation into the force's handling of information about Ian Watkins in 2012. 'Three South Yorkshire Police officers served with gross misconduct notices have already been interviewed by IPCC investigators. An interview with the fourth officer will take place in the near future.' At least one of the reports about Watkins (pictured on stage the V Festival in 2011) is said to have been made before he tried to rape a baby in London in 2012 . The police watchdog said it has received a substantial amount of information from the three forces involved, which is being analysed by investigators. The Independent Police Complaints Commission Commissioner Jan Williams said: 'We are making good progress with our three independent investigations. 'We are continuing to gather and analyse information to establish what steps were taken by police in response to the allegations made against Ian Watkins. 'And whether he could have been brought to justice sooner and whether his celebrity status had any impact on those investigations.' The IPCC is looking at the 'effectiveness of the response to reports of abuse' - after claims Watkins was reported to police as early as 2008. Cardiff Crown Court heard how Watkins attempted to rape baby in a hotel room in Shepherds Bush, London, in April 2012. The singer was jailed for 35 years last year after admitting a string of sex offences.","Lostprophets rockstar jailed for 35 years last year for string of sex offences .

"Reading bedtime stories, engaging in conversation and eating evening meals as a family are seen as hallmarks of conscientious parenting. But according to new research, while they may be positive ways of bonding with children, none of them have any influence on their intelligence. A criminology professor has found evidence to support the argument that IQ is in fact largely down to genetics. Scroll down for video . Reading bedtime stories (illustrated with a stock image), engaging in conversation and eating nightly dinners as a family are seen as hallmarks of conscientious parenting, but the activities don't make children smarter as adults, one expert claims . Professor Kevin Beaver of Florida University, examined a nationally representative sample of youth alongside a sample of adopted children from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. This study follows a sample of teenagers who were in grades 7 to 12 in the US in 1994, tracking them into adulthood. The last interview was in 2008 when the sample was aged 24 to 32. Using the information he collated, Professor Beaver analysed parenting behaviours and whether they had an effect on verbal intelligence as measured by the Picture Vocabulary Test (PVT). During the test an examiner presents a series of pictures to a person. There are four pictures to a page, and each is numbered. The examiner says a word describing one of the pictures and then asks the individual to point to or say the number of the picture that the word describes. The IQ tests were given to the children when they were in middle school, high school and aged 18 and 26. After studying the  habits of adoptive parents, Professor Beaver found that there was no association between parenting and a child's intelligence later in life. His study strengthens the theory that intelligence (illustrated in a stock image) is passed down genetically from parents to children . Last month, scientists revealed that differences in GCSE scores are largely down to DNA. A study of more than 6,500 pairs of twins showed that variations in grades in english, maths and science papers could largely be explained by the mix of genes passed from parents to child. Some 62 per cent of the difference in scores across the group was down to DNA. The other 38 per cent can be explained by ‘environmental’ factors. This term covers a large range of things from upbringing to health and diet. But while genes – or nature – are more important than nurture, it is not all about intelligence. Many other factors, including personality and behaviour, are also influenced by our genes – and affect exam scores. Even what we think of our teachers, can to some degree be traced back to our genes, the study by Kings College London says. ‘Previous research that has detected parenting-related behaviours affect intelligence is perhaps incorrect because it hasn't taken into account genetic transmission,’ Professor Beaver explained. Some studies have shown that parents who socialise their children by reading to them, for example, have smarter children than parents who do not engage in this way. But others argue that intelligence is passed down from parent to children genetically, not socially. To investigate which theory is true, Professor Beaver looked at families raising adopted children. ‘When we tested these two competing hypotheses in this adoptive-based research design, we found there was no association between parenting and the child's intelligence later in life once we accounted for genetic influences,’ Professor Beaver said. The finding is published in the journal Intelligence. Studying children who share no DNA with their adoptive parents eliminates the possibility that parental socialisation is really just a marker for genetic transmission, he explained. ‘In previous research, it looks as though parenting is having an effect on child intelligence, but in reality the parents who are more intelligent are doing these things and it is masking the genetic transformation of intelligence to their children.’ However, Professor Beaver stressed neglect or trauma may affect a child’s prospects. ‘The way you parent a child is not going to have a detectable effect on their IQ as long as that parenting is within normal bounds,’ he concluded.","Reading bedtime stories and having family dinners may socialise children .

"Marc Corrieri, 22, (pictured outside Hamilton Sheriff Court) admitted four charges of sending sexually explicit messages to schoolgirls aged 13 and 16 . A dwarf who hires himself out for £150 an hour for stag parties and hen nights has been spared jail after admitting harassing schoolgirls for sex. Marc Corrieri, 22, who can make £750 per night by being handcuffed to a groom-to-be, first messaged a pair of twins on Facebook when they were 15 and asked one to feel 'his third leg'. The 4ft 2in performer, from Motherwell, Lanarkshire, also sent explicit messages to a 13-year-old girl who he met at an under 16s disco. Corrieri, who often dresses up as Superman or as an Oompa Loompa from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for his work, boasted to the girls he was rich, claimed he had a flash car and offered one girl a job as his face painter. But he was caught by police after one girl's horrified mother found disgusting messages and feared her daughter was being groomed. He was hauled before Hamilton Sheriff Court but was spared prison yesterday after admitting four charges of sending sexually explicit messages to two 13-year-olds and two 16-year-olds between May 2011 and August 2012. Defence lawyer Stephen McQuillan said: 'This is a very serious matter. He is unemployed and lives at home with his parents. 'My submission is to ask you to step back from a custodial sentence and look at other options. 'I say again that he fully understands the serious nature of this offence.' The court heard how Corrieri first contacted a pair of twin sisters when they were aged 15 on Facebook. Depute fiscal Imran Bashir said: 'He originally asked the sisters to go for a walk with him. 'He sent regular messages but they stopped abruptly for about six months. 'When they turned 16 he messaged them again and they described the messages as being a lot more ""creepy"" than before. 'He asked one of them how far she had gone with a boy and told her to wear a mini skirt and tights and that he had a fancy car. 'He would message her about five or six times a day and he made sexual remarks. 'He told one of them he was now her boss and she would have to do what he said. 'She was worried he would be waiting for her after work.' Dwarf entertainer Corrieri, who hires himself out for £150 an hour for stag parties and hen nights and often dresses as an Oompa Loompa (above), was spared jail but ordered to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work . The 4ft 2in performer, from Motherwell, Lanarkshire, sent sexually explicit messages to a 13-year-old girl who he met at an under 16s disco, as well as inappropriate messages to a pair of twins and another girl aged 13 . Corrieri asked one of the girls to meet him in nearby woods and asked her to feel his 'third leg'. The court also heard how he contacted a 13-year-old girl on Facebook after meeting her at an under 16s disco he worked at. He offered her a face-painting job and said he would pay her £50 a day. But he later sent her sexual messages and asked about her sex life. He also contacted another 13-year-old and repeatedly asked her what school she went to and offered to collect her. None of the girls knew him before he contacted them. Corrieri had earlier told how loved his entertainment job but laid down strict ground rules to keep his dignity intact. He said: 'It's a different career. I wanted to have a laugh and I just thought ""go for it"". Corrieri asked one of the schoolgirls to meet him in woods near his house and asked her to feel his 'third leg' He was spared jail at Hamilton Sheriff Court (pictured) but ordered to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work . 'I get paid to go out and party with different lads, we get a lot of attention from the ladies and I get to enjoy myself. 'I dress up for them as Superman or as an Oompa Loompa but I draw the line at dressing up as a woman - that's a no go.' His rules included no picking up or throwing, no tampering with his drink, not using the word 'midget' and no police involvement. Sheriff Joyce Powrie handed him 240 hours of unpaid work and put him on the Sex Offenders' Register for three years. She said: 'I am prepared to make a community payback order and you will be subject to supervision. 'You also have to attend the sex offenders group work programme. 'If you are not compliant then you will be in breach of this order and brought back and I think you know that there will only be one place you will be going.'

"Ashoka Mukpo knew he really was in trouble when he saw the people treating him in full protective suits and hoods. The American video journalist is home now after recovering from Ebola he contracted while working in the virus-ravaged West African country of Liberia. In an interview with The Associated Press, he described the fear he felt when medical workers appeared at his bedside in the heavy duty gear needed to prevent the spread of the deadly infection. Ebola survivor Ashoka Mukpo says he knew he really was in trouble when he saw the people treating him in full suits and hoods . 'The only thing you can see is their eyes. And they're dripping with chlorine,' Mukpo said. 'You just realize what a bad situation you're in when your caregivers have to come in with such an incredible amount of protection.' Mukpo contracted the virus after working for a month as a freelance cameraman for NBC and other media outlets. He recounted the harrowing experiences he endured first with his diagnosis, then his treatment and at last his recovery on Saturday at his Rhode Island home two days after the latest Ebola case in the United States: the hospitalization of a New York City emergency room physician who had worked in Guinea. The 33-year-old Mukpo recalled taking his temperature, seeing it read 101.3, and feeling 'pure fear.' Mukpo contracted the virus after working for a month as a freelance cameraman for NBC and other media outlets . Being diagnosed with Ebola, Mukpo said, forced him to confront the possibility of his own death, and made him understand the terror and isolation so many West Africans are going through. Mukpo said he felt as if his body was 'at war' with the virus: he was in pain and weak, he had a fever that went as high as 104 degrees, it was hard to walk and eat, and he lost 15 pounds in a week. Mukpo isn't sure how he contracted Ebola because he said he was careful while filming. Mukpo was flown to the Nebraska Medical Center Oct. 6, where he was isolated in a biocontainment unit, given constant fluids and an experimental Ebola drug. He is only one of a handful of people who have been treated for Ebola in the United States: One patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, died after traveling from Liberia to Dallas while other health care workers who have been infected have, like Mukpo, recovered. Mukpo said it was difficult not to hold the hand of a loved one when he was so sick, but he added he's not sure how much direct contact he would've wanted. 'I needed to go into my body and find a place of strength, and find a place of calm,' he said. Mukpo said he had no other choice but to find that strength, because there is little room for fear. Mukpo was released from the hospital Wednesday and flew back to Rhode Island . 'I'm going to make it, I'm not going to give in to fear,' Mukpo said he told himself. 'I'm not going to give in to depression, embarrassment, I'm just going to live.' Receiving a blood transfusion from Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly, who was treated in Atlanta, was a turning point. The next day, Mukpo's eyesight was clearer, his headache and fever had lessened, and his body felt more under his control. Mukpo was released from the hospital Wednesday and flew back to Rhode Island. Mukpo said he felt compelled to go to Liberia because he had previously spent about two years there as a human rights advocate. 'I saw these awful things happening to this country that I had a connection to,' he said. 'There was still some confusion about what the international response could be. I felt like 'OK, if I shoot film, I write, I'm going to help be part of the solution to this.' And I felt like that was worth the risk.' As for returning to Liberia, Mukpo said he would consider it in the future, under the right circumstances. Mukpo said he felt compelled to go to Liberia because he had previously spent about two years there as a human rights advocate . For now, he said he's enjoying being somewhere safe and spending time with his family. He says he's getting stronger every day and he feels grateful, blessed and lucky to be home. Still, he said, he's acutely aware of the fact that most people battling the disease don't have a team of doctors. 'I would aspire that people, even in our moment of fear about Ebola in America, would consistently redirect their attention to what's going on in West Africa,' he said. 'These are good people who are getting sick, these are real people who are getting sick, and they deserve the benefit of everything we can do to help them solve this crisis.' Many West Africans who survive Ebola lose a family member, or their entire family, to the disease, Mukpo said, and his heart goes out to them. 'This thing takes a piece from you,' he said. 'It can be very small, or it can be very big.'","Ashoka Mukpo is at home recovering from Ebola he contracted working in Liberia .

"University cleaners have been warned to look out for blood and vomit as an estimated 20,000 students return from West Africa for the start of term. Universities the length and breadth of the country have drawn up emergency measures to monitor the highest-risk students for up to three weeks - the incubation period of the Ebola virus. Special attention is being paid to those who may be sharing bathrooms and kitchens, but officials stressed they were sensitive to any backlash against West African students. Scroll down for video . Fears: The Postgraduate Statistics Centre at Lancaster University, where cleaners have been warned to watch out for body fluids when cleaning the bathrooms in halls of residence housing West African students . About 20,000 students from West African countries affected by Ebola are studying at British universities, the Sunday Times reports. Around 17,000 of these are from Nigeria, however, where the outbreak is said to have been contained. 'Most universities are making sure cleaners are briefed on the risks,' Fay Sherrington, a student services manager at Lancaster University told the Sunday Times. 'They have more chance of coming into contact with bodily fluids because they are cleaning bathrooms in residences.' The move follows growing fears that an infected person could bring Ebola virus into the UK and cause an outbreak, as has already happened in the U.S. The government this week announced plans to screen air and Eurostar passengers arriving in Britain, but with no symptoms visible during Ebola's incubation period, there are questions as to how effective such screening may be. Exeter University revealed it had around 200 students returning from Ebola affected areas. A group of university officers would be monitoring accommodation arrangements, particularly where there was shared use of kitchen and bathrooms, but a spokesman insisted officials were sensitive to the possibility of alienating West African students. At University College, London, advice has been circulated telling students to call emergency services if they develop headache, diarrhoea or vomiting within three weeks of arriving back in Britain. And at Cardiff University staff are being told to isolate students complaining of Ebola-like symptoms. MailOnline contacted the National Union of Students for comment on the arrangements, but none was forthcoming. Melting pot: At University College London, advice has been circulated telling students to call emergency services if they develop headache, diarrhoea or vomiting within three weeks of arriving back in Britain . Last night the Health Secretary insisted Britain has 'robust' plans in place to cope with an Ebola outbreak, after a national emergency services exercise. Jeremy Hunt insisted he was 'doubly reassured' that the Government and emergency services were ready if the disease reached the UK after an exercise to test how the authorities would respond. The eight-hour mock-up saw actors simulate symptoms of the deadly virus while Government ministers joined dozens of medical professionals from hospitals, the ambulance service and Public Health England as they played through scenarios across the country. In one case a person who collapsed in Gateshead shopping centre was placed in isolation at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle after being assessed. Samples were sent for urgent testing at the Porton Down government science laboratories and returned an Ebola diagnosis. In a separate case, a patient turned up to the Hillingdon walk-in centre in London with flu-like symptoms after having recently returned from West Africa. Blood tests were again sent to Porton Down, Wiltshire, and the patient was diagnosed with the disease. Public Health England also began tracing the contacts of the people involved. 'Doubly reassured': Staff from North East Ambulance Service and the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, take part in the nationwide simulation of an Ebola virus outbreak in Britain yesterday . Mr Hunt chaired a simulated meeting of the emergency Cobra committee as part of the exercise. He said: 'This is an extremely useful exercise and I feel doubly reassured that we have robust plans in place in the event that we get an Ebola case in the UK. 'We will evaluate what went well and what we need to improve. 'This exercise is just one small part of our ongoing contingency plans for Ebola. It builds on activity we routinely practise for a wide variety of illnesses and other emergencies.' The number of deaths confirmed as a result of the current Ebola outbreak stands at 4,033, according to the World Health Organisation. Most were in Liberioa, Sierra Leone and Guinea.","Special attention is being paid to students sharing bathrooms and kitchens .

"Critical care nurse David Hadfield, 54, allegedly struck 72-year-old Thomas Bretherton in the centre of his forehead . A nurse repeatedly headbutted an elderly patient in his care who was struggling to breathe, a court has heard today. Critical care nurse David Hadfield, 54, allegedly struck 72-year-old Thomas Bretherton in the centre of his forehead leaving him with three cuts while he was being treated at Royal Blackburn Hospital, Lancashire. Mr Bretherton had been admitted after being diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and was 'confused' and struggling to breathe when he was attacked, Preston Crown Court heard. He died shortly after the alleged attack, although the prosecution stresses this was in no way related to the incident. Hadfield denies wounding with intent and an alternative charge of unlawful wounding. Tim Storrie, prosecuting, said: 'Thomas Bretherton was struck more than once causing wounds to open on his head after he was repeatedly headbutted. 'The prosecution say that the manner of the attack, coupled with the knowledge of how sick Mr Bretherton was, means that this attack manifested an intention to cause harm. Not just harm, but really serious harm.' Mr Bretherton went into hospital in August last year and was required to wear a CPAP hood - a clear soft plastic helmet with a continuous supply of oxygen designed to help patients who have problems breathing. The victim was also known to be very distressed and confused because of medication he was taking, the jury heard. On August 6, Mr Storrie said Hadfield, who was assigned to look after Mr Bretherton, decided it was necessary to change his sheet. The court heard from Lucy Wood, one of Hadfield's colleagues, who has worked as a critical care nurse for 13 years. She told the court she and another nurse had been asked to help him with his task. Miss Wood said: 'David asked us to try and be quiet, not to talk to the patient much because he had been unsettled earlier in the day. So we tried not to disturb him much.' The witness said that after changing the sheet, Mr Bretherton woke up. She added: 'He was startled. He said words to the effect of 'get away from me'. 'He did not know what was going on. He was kind of flailing his arms around.' During the incident, Miss Wood's finger was bent back and she had to let go of Mr Bretherton's hand as she screamed out in pain, the court heard. Mr Bretherton also managed to pull a monitoring machine off his finger and broke it. A court heard Mr Bretherton was left with three cuts while he was being treated at Royal Blackburn Hospital, Lancashire (pictured) The jury heard how Hadfield decided it was necessary to administer the sedative Haloperidol to try to calm the patient down and as he tried to find his canula, their heads collided. Miss Wood said: 'David was close to the bedside trying to give the medication. The patient sat up and caught him. 'David said 'come on then' to the patient. It felt like he was inviting the patient to do that again, to hit him in the face. 'The patient was still agitated. David lunged forward. 'It was like they were both lunging forward at the same time, clashing heads again. 'It all happened quite quickly, but I was stunned that David retaliated against a patient who was obviously confused instead of trying to calm him down.' The witness told jurors that after the third clash, Hadfield asked for somebody to get a doctor to see Mr Bretherton and was 'concerned' about how he was. Hadfield denies wounding with intent and an alternative charge of unlawful wounding at Preston Crown Court . Simon Nichol, for the defendant, of Oldham, said Hadfield had become unbalanced because of the way he was trying to hold Mr Bretherton's arm steady so that he could give the medication. He told the court: 'Each time the patient brought his head forward towards David, David was pulling his head down to avoid being hit again in the face.' Miss Wood replied: 'It did not look like he was avoiding the patient. It seemed like he was making a focused movement towards the centre of his head.' Mr Bretherton died shortly after the alleged attack, although Mr Storrie stressed that his death was not related at all to the incident. Hadfield claims that Mr Bretherton became 'confused and paranoid' as he tried to change his sheet and says that the grandfather-of-five headbutted him . Hadfield claims that Mr Bretherton became 'confused and paranoid' as he tried to change his sheet and says that the grandfather-of-five headbutted him. But giving evidence at court, his colleague Leanne Whittaker, a staff nurse, said: 'This was a very poorly patient. He wouldn't have had the energy to move himself forward. 'I was stood at the nurses' station and I was alerted that there was shouting. 'It got louder and then I heard something like 'shut up and lie down'. 'It was a man's voice. I put the monitor on so I could see what was going on and it looked like Hadfield threw himself forcefully into the patient. 'He did this three times and made contact three times with the patient's forehead. 'I shouted out ""that is absolutely disgusting"" and everybody was shocked. 'When I went into the room, Hadfield seemed agitated and the sister asked him to leave. 'I took over his care after that.' The court heard that Mr Bretherton had been 'calm and sleeping' when Hadfield entered the room at around midnight during a night shift to change his sheet. Another colleague, Caroline Piper, who had been standing 40 feet away, also turned on her monitor when she heard shouting coming from the room. She told the court: 'The patient was lying at a 45 degree angle. 'There was one nurse on one side of him and two on the other. 'His hands were being held and so he was trying to sit forward. 'He did lunge forward with his head but he did not make contact with David. 'He wasn't near enough to make contact. David then lunged with his head towards the patient and I saw their heads clash. 'David lunged towards him three times. 'I was stunned and baffled by what I saw and I couldn't make sense of it.' Hadfield, who wrote down his account of what happened in his staff notes the night of the incident on August 6, 2013, said that Mr Bretherton became 'abusive' as he tried to reposition him. He said: 'It was evident that he was confused and paranoid when he was advised that he was in hospital. 'He started to hit out and we avoided his blows. He gripped my hand and had my elbow locked. 'He then headbutted me. He had my elbow trapped and pulled me towards him. 'He then headbutted me two further times before I could free myself. 'His head was bleeding and I called out for help.'

"With the polls already open in some battleground states, and just seven days left on the calendar until Election Day, a new survey shows that Americans remain unhappy with the Democratic president and the direction he is taking the country in. In the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll Americans again gave Obama an approval rating, and seven in 10 said they believe the country is on the wrong track. One of the only positive nuggets of news for the president and his party in the new survey is that half of Americans said their vote in the midterms would not be a reflection of their feelings about the president. That bodes well for embattled Democrats whose Republican challengers have promoted their candidacies as referendum on the sinking president. Upside for Democrats: Half of Americans said their vote in the midterms would not be a reflection of their feelings about the president . Just seven in 10 Americans say they believe the country is on the wrong track - that doesn't bode well for Democrats competing in next Tuesday's midterm elections . Still, twice as many respondents, 31 percent, said their vote would be to show opposition to Obama than those who said it would be to make a statement of support, 16 percent. And 63 percent say the government's ability to deal with the nation's problems has gotten worse. Americans who feel that way favor Republicans to come in and save the day by nearly a three to one margin. Democrats hoping for an October Surprise or some other Hail Mary are unlikely to get one at this point in race. With just a week left to go until Election Day, it's all about turnout now. ABC News' survey shows that even though voters expect Republicans to take control of Congress, Democrats still have a shot if they can turn out their supporters to the polls. Among likely voters, the GOP has a six-point advantage going into next Tuesday's elections. But when all registered voters are taken into account, it's Democrats who have the edge. Registered voters said they prefer the Democratic candidate in their congressional district to Republican one, 47-44 That's compared to likely voters, who said they plan to cast a ballot for the GOP candidate next week by a margin of 50-44. Not helpful: Obama's underwater approval rating may also hurt Democratic candidates at the polls next week . Whether or not Democrats will be able to mobilize their supporters in the next several days is make or break for the party, which is in danger of losing nine Senate seats currently held by Democrats to the Republican Party. If endangered Republicans are able to fend off their Democratic challengers in three key states and the party as a whole is able to pick off three additional Democrats, that's the ball game for the president's party during his final two years in office. Obama's only means of recourse will be to use his vaunted pen and phone to issue vetoes of Republican-passed legislation. While a Republican-controlled legislative branch would theoretically be game changer for federal policymaking, a large segment of likely voters, 31 percent, believe the change-up will make no difference. Another 28 percent of the survey-takers told ABC News and Washington Post's pollsters they think Republican leadership of the Senate will be bad for the country. A plurality, 39 percent, said they thought the GOP would do a good job.","Election Day is around the corner and a new survey shows that Americans remain unhappy with the Democratic president .

"A lifeguard from Hawaii is recovering in hospital after being hit on the head by a falling coconut. Harold Teshima was treated in hospital for concussion and a gash to his head after the coconut fell on him in Hanauma Bay on Friday. Mr Teshima said he was fifteen minutes from the end of his shift, helping to clean up after hurricane Ana, when he was suddenly knocked unconscious. Lifeguard Harold Teshima was taken to hospital with concussion, a cut to his forehead and neck strain after being hit over the head by a falling coconut . He told KHON2: 'I remember feeling my forehead, feeling blood dripping down my nose. I didn’t know what was going on. So I laid down.' Fellow lifeguards rushed to help him, and discovered a 4lb coconut, approximately the size of a softball, laying nearby. Mr Teshima was put on to a stretcher and taken to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for concussion, a cut to his head, neck strain and nausea. He has since said the accident could have been prevented, as lifeguards were reporting two weeks previously that large coconuts were falling from the trees. Mr Teshima, who says the accident could have killed him, was injured on Hanauma Bay beach on Friday while helping to clear up after Hurricane Ana . He added: 'It's a good thing it happened to me and not a child or infant. Could have been fatal. Could have been fatal to me, actually.' A city spokesman said the trees are trimmed every six months, and were last trimmed five months before Mr Teshima was injured. The spokesman added that workers were sent to cut the foliage back after the accident on Friday.","Harold Teshima was knocked unconscious after 4lb coconut fell on his head .

"Researchers have unveiled a new pill that could replace injections. It can deliver drugs that cannot currently be delivered as a pill. However, there is one caveat -  the pill is covered in tiny needles. Scroll down for video . The microneedle pill is coated with hollow needles. When the pill reaches the desired location in the digestive tract, the pH-sensitive coating surrounding the capsule dissolves, allowing the drug to be released. The microneedle pill is coated with hollow needles. When the pill reaches the desired location in the digestive tract, the pH-sensitive coating surrounding the capsule dissolves, allowing the drug to be released. Their prototype acrylic capsule, 2 centimeters long and 1 centimeter in diameter, includes a reservoir for the drug and is coated with hollow, stainless steel needles about 5 millimeters long. Because there are no pain receptors in the GI tract, patients would not feel any pain from the drug injection. Researchers at MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) have devised a novel drug capsule coated with tiny needles that can inject drugs directly into the lining of the stomach after the capsule is swallowed. In animal studies, the team found that the capsule delivered insulin more efficiently than injection under the skin, and there were no harmful side effects as the capsule passed through the digestive system. 'This could be a way that the patient can circumvent the need to have an infusion or subcutaneous administration of a drug,' says Giovanni Traverso, who led the research, which appears in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Although the researchers tested their capsule with insulin, they anticipate that it would be most useful for delivering biopharmaceuticals such as antibodies, which are used to treat cancer and autoimmune disorders like arthritis and Crohn's disease. This class of drugs, known as 'biologics,' also includes vaccines, recombinant DNA, and RNA. 'The large size of these biologic drugs makes them nonabsorbable. And before they even would be absorbed, they're degraded in your GI tract by acids and enzymes that just eat up the molecules and make them inactive,' says Carl Schoellhammer, a graduate student in chemical engineering and a lead author of the paper. Scientists have tried designing microparticles and nanoparticles that can deliver drugs, but such particles are expensive to produce and require a new version to be engineered for each drug. When the pill has reached the desired location in the GI tract, the coating dissolves, revealing the microneedles. In the case of hollow microneedles (top right), the drug reservoir is compressed through peristalsis, releasing the drug through the needles. In the case of solid microneedles (bottom right), the drug is formulated into the microneedles. The microneedles lodge in the tissue where they can slowly dissolve and release their payload. The MIT prototype acrylic capsule, 2 centimeters long and 1 centimeter in diameter, includes a reservoir for the drug and is coated with hollow, stainless steel needles about 5 millimeters long. Previous studies of accidental ingestion of sharp objects in human patients have suggested that it could be safe to swallow a capsule coated with short needles. Because there are no pain receptors in the GI tract, patients would not feel any pain from the drug injection. To test whether this type of capsule could allow safe and effective drug delivery, the researchers tested it in pigs, with insulin as the drug payload. It took more than a week for the capsules to move through the entire digestive tract, and the researchers found no traces of tissue damage, supporting the potential safety of this novel approach. This approach could also be used to administer vaccines that normally have to be injected, the researchers say. The team now plans to modify the capsule so that peristalsis, or contractions of the digestive tract, would slowly squeeze the drug out of the capsule as it travels through the tract. They are also working on capsules with needles made of degradable polymers and sugar that would break off and become embedded in the gut lining, where they would slowly disintegrate and release the drug.","Pill is coated with hollow needles .

"Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, wants the 1.35million employees to be part of a national effort to highlight its dangers . NHS staff will be urged to join weight-watching groups and take out gym memberships in the fight against obesity crisis, the chief executive will announce this week. Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, wants the 1.35million employees to be part of a national effort to highlight its dangers. He will put forward sweeping changes, including moves to reduce the sale of high-sugar and high-fat products on hospital premises. During the five-year 'forward view' for the health service, he will also say hospital trusts should offer healthy food for their staff 24 hours a day. Only a quarter of hospitals offer healthy food to night staff, which means they have to rely on vending machines and microwave meals. 'For the largest employer in Europe, which is dealing with the health of our people, that is appalling,' an NHS insider told the Observer. A senior NHS source, speaking ahead of Stevens's report, said it was time for the NHS to 'up its game' on obesity. 'We were warned over a decade ago that unless there was decisive action, the NHS would be picking up the tab for a sharp rise in avoidable illness. That warning wasn't heeded and the NHS is now on the hook for 12 years of inaction. 'Obesity has to come off the 'too hard to do' list. The health of millions of children and the sustainability of the NHS depend on a radical upgrade in prevention, starting with the billion-pound problem of obesity.' Mr Stevens hopes that other public institutions, including schools, will take a similar line. One in five young people and one in four adults in the UK now suffer from obesity, which each year causes 34,000 deaths and costs the NHS more than £1billion. Last year almost 11,000 people – 8,000 of them women – were admitted to hospital with a primary diagnosis of obesity. Warnings about its rise, and spiralling costs, were issued in a government-commissioned report by Sir Derek Wanless in 2002. One in five young people and one in four adults in the UK now suffer from obesity, which each year causes 34,000 deaths .","NHS chief executive wants staff to be part of a campaign to tackle obesity .

The lawsuit alleges that 'After conducting a traffic stop at which Indiana State Police Trooper Brian Hamilton presented Ms. Bogan with a warning ticket, Trooper Hamilton prolonged the stop by asking Ms. Bogan, among other things, if she had accepted Jesus Christ as her savior and then presented her with a pamphlet from the First Baptist Church in Cambridge that informed the reader that he or she is a sinner, listed God's Plan of Salvation, noting that the person must realize that ""the Lord Jesus Christ paid the penalty for your sins; and, advertised a radio broadcast entitled ""Policing for Jesus Ministries."" The lawsuit goes on to allege that 'The actions of defendant Trooper Hamilton violated Ms. Bogan's rights under both the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Ms. Bogan is entitled to her damages.' 'The whole time, his lights were on,' Bogan told The Indianapolis Star. 'I had no reason to believe I could just pull away at that point, even though I had my warning.' Her lawsuit alleges Hamilton's behavior was 'coercive,' 'unwarranted' and 'extremely upsetting.' 'Unconstitutional': Borga's lawsuit alleges that Hamilton's behavior was in violation of First and Fourth Amendments . MailOnline has reached out to the Indiana State Police for comment. Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law professor Jennifer Drobac told The Indianapolis Star 'The police officer is representing the government... so that means, as a representative, this person, while on duty, while engaged in official action, is basically overstepping and is trying to establish religion.' However, Micah Clark of the American Family Association of Indiana told the newspaper 'I have people pass out religious material all the time. Mormons come to my door all the time, and it doesn't offend me. [This case] might not be the most persuasive time to talk to someone about their faith, but I don't think that a police officer is prohibited from doing something like that.'","Indiana State Police Trooper is being sued by Ellen Bogan .

"A woman tasked with not saying sorry for an entire week has shared what she learned from the eye-opening experiment. New York-based journalist Gabrielle Moss wrote on Bustle.com that before giving up the word, she didn't realize the extent to which she had been using it 'as a way of seeming less powerful, or as a way of showing my subservience to someone more powerful than me.' Having to avoid saying 'sorry' opened her eyes to the tendency of women to over-apologize, especially in the workplace. Scroll down for video . No apologies: Journalist Gabrielle Moss, who was tasked with not saying sorry for an entire week, has shared what she learned from the eye-opening experiment . 'Though I've worried for a long time that I'm not good or smart enough to make it in the professional world, before this experiment, I never realized that I was expressing this to my bosses by constantly apologizing to them,' she writes. Indeed, while Gabrielle expected to have a tough time not apologizing to friends and her boyfriend for emotional reasons or to strangers for public clumsiness, the real problem was at work. Gabrielle found that she had been saying 'sorry' to bosses and co-workers as a means of expressing and acknowledging her own inadequacy. Instead of explaining why a story she was working on was late, for instance, she would apologize out of the fear of being looked down upon. 'A ""sorry"" to an editor about a late piece really meant ""I feel that I’m an impostor, and I’m terrified you'll never work with me again upon discovering that I'm not perfect and am turning this piece in late,""' she explains. During the experiment, she made an effort to find alternatives to 'sorry'. For example, instead of apologizing for a late article, she simply told her editor that it would be in soon. 'I found that explaining what was actually going on, instead of just offering a reflexive ""sorry,"" didn't seem to annoy her, or anyone else, the way I had anticipated,' she says. This tendency to over-apologize is shared among the female sex, says Gabrielle. 'We're raised to give out insincere apologies that are actually just displays of power and subservience from the time we're little kids,' she writes. She notes the different ways in which men and women ask for things at work, with women usually beginning the conversation with, 'Sorry for bothering you,' while men just go straight to the point. Excuses: 'A ""sorry"" to an editor about a late piece really meant ""I feel that I’m an impostor, and I’m terrified you'll never work with me again upon discovering that I'm not perfect,""' she explains . While over-apologizing isn't doing women any favors in the workplace, taking it to the opposite extreme is just as detrimental. This is 'the great irony of women in any position of power,' says Gabrielle. 'Apologize constantly, and everyone says you’re annoying, sniveling, have low self-esteem; never apologize, and you're just a b****. 'It's a set of standards that are so deeply culturally ingrained, it’s tough not to believe them about yourself.' Through her experiment, Gabrielle learned that it's possible - even beneficial - to function at work without apologizing whenever anything goes wrong. 'Instead of protecting me, my ""sorries"" eroded me,' she says. 'I don't know if permanently cutting back on them will completely change my life, but I think it'll help me realize that my existence isn't something that I need to apologize for.'","Journalist Gabrielle Moss was told by her editor to not say sorry for an entire week, and to write about the results ."

"Buddy Franklin was the name on tens of thousands of fans' lips as the AFL grand final parade proceeded on a sunny spring day in Melbourne. Franklin and Dan Hannebery's vehicle was the one that generated the most noise from the streets as the motorcade worked its way through the CBD.

None of them were able to find front position in the way Franklin has on the field so often in this year's finals series. Franklin was as relaxed as ever, waving to fans and answering all questions with a grin. Cyril Rioli and Ben McEvoy were arguably the happiest men in the procession, having been recalled by Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson on Thursday night. Josh Gibson, as has happened often this year, found himself a supporting actor in the Buddy circus. Gibson remains a close friend of Franklin and is the Hawthorn defender most likely to be handed the unenviable task of manning the star at the MCG on Saturday.

"David Shacklefield was allowed to keep his licence despite ignoring a red light . A white van man has been allowed to keep his driving licence despite racing over a level crossing after the traffic lights had turned red. David Shackleford claims he did not have enough time to stop the vehicle after realising the lights had changed at the crossing in Foxton, Cambridgeshire, so decided it would be safer to speed over the tracks. The 28-year-old trainee truck driver was moments away from colliding with a train, but has been allowed to keep his licence after pleading with magistrates. The driver from Harrow, north west London, was fined £200 and given three points for the incident on January 15. After initially claiming he the lights were on amber, the driver admitted he ignored them after being sent images taken from CCTV footage which clearly show him in plain view of the red light. But Judge Ken Sheraton decided not to disqualify Shackleford, as it would put him out of work. 'I was driving at 40mph and it would have been unsafe for me to slam the breaks on. 'By the time the lights came into view it would have been silly for me to stop.' It is not the first time drivers have had a near miss with oncoming trains at the crossing in Cambridgeshire. In 2010 John McDonald, 38, ignored the flashing warning lights and accelerated his 44-tonne sewage truck over the crossing. The driver was filmed approaching the crossing while the lights are red despite claiming they were amber . Shacklefield accelerated over the train lines just moments before a train thundered by at the crossing in Cambridgeshire . The automatic barriers smashed as they crashed on top of the artic. Two years later Belal Ahmed, 32, was convicted of speeding under the dropping barriers in the BMW, and ten days after that Girish Babu, 31, stopped his Mercedes on the crossing, forcing the signalman to stop the barriers in mid-air. Sgt Andy Cook of British Transport Police said: 'Misusing level crossings is extremely dangerous and will not be tolerated by BTP. 'Drivers who ignore the warning lights and barriers don’t just risk their own lives, but also endanger other road users and rail passengers and staff.'","David Shackleford claimed he did not have time to stop the van .

"New research has found where defendants sit in court could influence a jury's verdict. The study, by the University of Western Sydney, involved more than 400 mock jurors and examined how likely it was that panelists would return a guilty verdict if the defendant was seated in an enclosed glass dock, an open dock or beside their lawyer. The study, featured on ABC's Lateline, compared the results from the three arrangements during a fake terrorism trial held in western Sydney. Scroll down for video .

The jurors were provided the same witnesses and evidence as was given in the terror related trial of the now infamous Khaled Sharrouf (centre left) and Mohamed Elomar (centre right) in 2009 . In Australia, jurors are commonly seated in the glass dock, whereas the alternative options are favoured in America. The jurors were provided the same witnesses and evidence as was given in the terror related trial of the now infamous Khaled Sharrouf and Mohammed Elomar in 2009, one of Australia's longest and most cases, which involved over 300 witnesses. Glass boxes were removed from the case due to concerns they would sway the verdict of the jury members. According to the study, 60 per cent of jurors delivered a guilty verdict when the defendant was in the glass dock, while 47 per cent in the open dock and 36 per cent when next to their lawyer.

David Tait, from the University of Western Sydney, told Lateline 'the impressions were that the accused was more dangerous, more violent and more threatening in the glass box.'

"Poignant footage of First World War soldiers will be projected on to Stonehenge as part of a new exhibition telling the story of how one million men trained on Salisbury Plains during the conflict. The footage of the soldiers marching is being beamed onto the ancient stones for a memorial service marking the opening of the Soldiers At Stonehenge project. Although it is usually associated with more ancient history, Stonehenge stood at the centre of what was between 1914 and 1918 the world's largest military training camp. Poignant: Footage of First World War soldiers will be projected on to Stonehenge as part of a new exhibition telling the story of how one million men trained on Salisbury Plains during the conflict . Troops: During the conflict, some 180,000 men were stationed on Salisbury Plain at any one time, coming from across the Commonwealth to prepare for battle . During the conflict, some 180,000 men were stationed there at any one time, coming from across the Commonwealth to prepare for battle. The exhibition, which opens tomorrow at the Stonehenge Visitors Centre, aims to explore the untold story of Stonehenge, the Salisbury Plains and those who trained for war around the iconic site. Visitors to the centre will be able to learn what life was like for the men who trained on Salisbury Plaine, though stories, photographs and historical artifacts. The exhibition, which will run for six months, will also show how reminders of their presence can still be seen across the wider Stonehenge landscape, with Salisbury Plain still used by the military for training purposes today. 'Troops from across the British Empire travelled to the Salisbury Plains to prepare for war starting with Canadian soldiers in 1914, followed by men of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs) in 1916,' said Robert Campbell, Head of Interpretation at English Heritage. 'The task of the men training on Salisbury Plain was to overcome the horrific stalemate of trench warfare. 'To replicate conditions on the Western Front, soldiers dug intricate networks of trenches which were then pounded by shellfire. Innovative but deadly new technology pioneered in the training camps and secret establishments created in Wiltshire during 1914 - 1918 resulted in major developments in aviation, artillery and chemical warfare.' Items on show include medals awarded to Lieutenant Edmund Antrobus, the heir to Stonehenge, who was killed in action, and original artwork of The Better 'Ole - one of the most famous war cartoons of all time which was developed by Bruce Bairnsfather on Salisbury Plain. Soldiers: Drummer Jacob Bruce and Lance Corporal Owein O'Brien from the 1st Battalion Royal Regiment Fusiliers, based at nearby Tidworth, practice the 'Last Post' as they prepare for a memorial service marking the opening of the exhibition tomorrow . History: Although it is usually associated with more ancient history, Stonehenge stood at the centre of what was between 1914 and 1918 the world's largest military training camp . The humorist and cartoonist had been posted to the 34th Division headquarters on Salisbury Plain, after serving at the front and being hospitalised with shellshock following the Second Battle of Ypres. It was while he was on Salisbury Plan that he developed his humorous series of cartoons about life in the trenches, with The Better 'Ole, depicting two soldiers in a muddy shell hole, one of the best remembered. Bairnsfather went on to invent Old Bill, an old soldier with a trademark walrus moustache and balaclava. His cartoons achieved immense popularity because they expressed the views of the ordinary soldier in the trenches. Lieutenant Antrobus, whose father Sir Edmund had also been a soldier, was killed in action just seventeen days after arriving at the front. Sir Edmund, who served in the 1880s Sudan Campaign, inherited Stonehenge as part of the Amesbury Abbey estate in 1899. His son and heir landed in Belgium in 1914 and was killed in action at Ypres in October 1914. Sir Edmund died in February 1915, it was said, of a broken heart. After their deaths the grieving Lady Florence Antrobus placed the war medals of both her husband and son within an ornate cabinet along with a portrait of her son which she had painted herself. The loss of both the owner and heir to Stonehenge lead in part to the monument being put up for sale at auction in 1915. Although there were calls for the Nation to purchase Stonehenge, it was Cecil Chubb, a locally born Barrister, who was the successful purchaser and it was he who was the last person to privately own Stonehenge. Also on show are a number of archaeological finds including cap badges, rifle cartridges, aircraft parts and highly personal items such as a spoon and even part of a bottle of Australian hair tonic. The special exhibition, Soldiers at Stonehenge - Salisbury Plain And The Journey To The First World War opens on November 5 at the Stonehenge exhibition and visitor centre. Admission is included in the entry price for Stonehenge.","Footage of soldiers marching being beamed onto the ancient stones during Soldiers At Stonehenge exhibition .

"Their feelings for each other led them to break their religious vows, marry and have children. Now, the remarkable love story of a Franciscan monk and a nun has been revealed by their son. Comedian John Fugelsang, 45, posted a series of photos documenting his parents'  romance on Twitter on the first anniversary of his father's death. Relatives: Comedian John Fugelsang (right), 45, tweeted this photo (left) of his late father, saying: 'My father Jack grew up in Flatbush Brooklyn; when he joined the Franciscans his name became Brother Boniface' Monk: This photo was among a series of tweets about Mr Fugelsang's parents' romance. Its caption read: 'As a Franciscan my dad taught history to Catholic boys & walked among people like the Lost Jedi of Flatbush' Secret love: Alongside this black-and-white photo, the American comedian and actor wrote: 'My father fell in love with a southern nun who worked as a nurse in bklyn & secretly carried a torch for 10 years' Devoted to religion: This image, picturing Brother Boniface (left) and a fellow monk, was captioned: 'The nun/nurse he loved was sent to work w/lepers in Malawi; He couldn't reveal feelings but wrote her every week' Keeping in touch: Meanwhile, this image of Mr Fugelsang's father (centre) was accompanied with the words: 'Every week he'd write Sister Damien in Africa with the news abt America - Dr. King, Civil Rights, Vietnam....' Too strong a love: 'Eventually his superior in the Franciscan Brothers (left) figured it out & said ""If you love her, marry her"",' said Mr Fugelsang. 'After 10 years he confessed his love & they married 2 months later (right)' Accompanied by short captions, they reveal how Jack and Peggy Fugelsang sent each other platonic letters for a staggering 10 years, before eventually breaking their vows to wed. After finishing high school in Flatbush, Brookyln, Mr Fugelsang's father joined the Franciscan monks, where he became known as 'Brother Boniface' and swore to dedicate his life to God. During this time, he taught history to Catholic schoolboys, before falling ill with tuberculosis and meeting his future wife, a nun called 'Sister Damien' who worked as a nurse in Brooklyn. 'From all accounts I heard, he fell madly, desperately, insanely in love with this Southern nurse in a nun's habit that he knew he could never have, and had sworn to God he would never want to have,' Fugelsang told National Public Radio. Why wait? Mr Fugelsang revealed his parents  thought they should delay the wedding, but his mother's sister told them: 'It's going to be a scandal anyway, so why wait?' Above, his parents on their wedding day . True love: This photo of Mr Fugelsang's father planting a kiss on his new wife's head was captioned: 'At 1st her mom was horrified she'd marry a yankee from brooklyn. 'I won't be able to understand a thing he says' Wedding: 'They married 2 months after she left the convent. It was a first love, and 2nd marriage, for them both (left),' said the comedian, who has hosted America's Funniest Home Videos. He added: 'For her 16 years of poverty, chastity & obedience the church thanked her with one grey cotton dress & $200 (right)' Well-wishers: This photo, of the wedding car, was captioned: 'Southern ladies & the northern groom's car' According to the comedian's tweets, Brother Boniface then held a secret torch for Sister Damien for a decade, expressing his love through platonic letters. He sent the letters - in which he reported on American politics and events - on a weekly basis to Malawi, where his love had started caring for people with leprosy. Despite his attempts to keep his feelings hidden, Brother Boniface's Franciscan superior eventually figured them out and unexpectedly told him: 'If you love her, marry her.' But it was only on Sister Damien's return to Brooklyn following her father's death that the monk left his monastery and showed up at the hospital where she was working, professing his love for her. Besotted: Mr Fugelsang said that it was his parents' second marriage - their first having been a marriage to God. He captioned the above picture: 'My father the brother & my mother the sister, post-vow breaking' Happy family: Following the ceremony, Brother Boniface and Sister Damien dropped their religious names, before settling in Bohemia, Long Island, raising children (pictured) and living happily for decades . Bliss: 'I always felt like after I left the clergy & got married my faith actually got deeper,' said Mr Fugelsang, quoting his father. The comedian added: 'I can honestly say that my father's love only grew as he got older' Taking a turn for the worse: This image, showing Mr Fugelsang's parents embracing, was captioned: 'The week before he turned 70 my dad has his 2nd heart attack & Dr.s said there was nothing they could do' 'She was appalled,' said Mr Fugelsang, who has hosted America's Funniest Home Videos and consulted for comedienne Rosie O'Donnell. However, Sister Damien was shortly won over and left the convent, before marrying her love in a ceremony at an Army base two months later, during which she wore a knee-length white dress. In his tweets, Mr Fugelsang reveals his parents initially thought they should delay the wedding, but his mother's sister told them: 'It's going to be a scandal anyway, so why wait?' He adds that it was his parents' second marriage - their first having been a marriage to God. Frail: 'My Dad heard about a joint Israeli-Thai stem cell treatment in Thailand, using one's own stem cells from blood', said the comedian, tweeting this black-and-white image of his frail-looking father . Smiling: Mr Fugelsang said: 'My Catholic dad put his faith in the Buddhists & the Jews, & traveled to Bangkok b/c he wanted more time with her'. He added that his father said he was 'too in love' with his wife to die . Battling through it together: He said of his father: 'He could no longer walk & my mother took him to Thailand in a wheelchair, for treatment still illegal in the US'. Above, Jack Fugelsang is pictured holding his wife's hand . Staying strong: 'He returned from Stem Cell Treatment still not available in US b/c someone thinks it's against the Bible, I think,' wrote Mr Fugelsang alongside this picture (left) of his smiling father. He added: 'The same love that brought him out of the clergy kept him alive longer than any of the doctors predicted (left)' Following the ceremony, Brother Boniface and Sister Damien dropped their religious names, before settling in Bohemia, Long Island, raising children and living happily for decades. 'I can honestly say that my father's love only grew as he got older and as they aged,' said Mr Fugelsang. 'The romance didn't slow down for him at all. He was someone who was completely unable to separate his devotion to God from his devotion to his wife.' As he reached his late 60s, Mr Fugelsang's father suffered two heart attacks and was told by doctors that there was nothing more they could do. Affectionate: Following the stem cell treatment, Mr Fugelsang said of his father: 'Within months he was walking again & took my mom on their 1st cruise. This was taken 2 yrs later, in Hollywood' Having a laugh: This image, which appears to show Mr Fugelsang's father speaking at a family wedding, was captioned: 'C'mon, let Dad speak as part of the ceremony. What's the worst that could happen?' 'The Stem Cell doctors told him he would get a maximum of 2 more years of life from the treatment. He took 5' However, the pensioner refused to believe them, saying he was 'too in love to die', said his son. He subsequently underwent a risky stem-cell treatment in Thailand, which allowed him to live happily for a few more years before passing away in August 2010. Mr Fugelsang, who posted the original tweets in 2012, has also told his parents' love story in a solo performance, Guilt: A Love Story. New arrival: This photo, depicting Mr Fugelsang's father holding his grandson, was posted with the words: 'The day before he died he got to see his grandson Endy, who gets to live in this world b/c Jack broke a vow to God' The look of love: Mr Fugelsang, who posted the original tweets in 2012, wrote alongside this image: 'My father died 1 year ago today. This is one of my last photos of him, looking at his wife, and it's my favorite' Performance: Mr Fugelsang (seen with his father) has also told his parents' love story in Guilt: A Love Story .","Comedian John Fugelsang's parents Jack and Peggy first met in Brooklyn .

"A man who lost everything in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan and claimed over 15,000 lives, is finally getting back one of his prized possessions - his jet ski.

The craft, while badly damaged and no longer in working condition, had traveled approximately 3,300 miles. Lampe was conducting a bird survey back on May 21 when she discovered the jet ski. 'He's lost everything,' Lampe, 23, said of the craft's owner while speaking with the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. 'Getting something back, even if it can't be used, means a lot.' And now, thanks to some help from Chris Woolaway, the Hawaii coordinator for a global event called International Coastal Cleanup, Matsunaga is getting his jet ski back free of charge. Woolaway called on a friend who reached out to the captain of a Japanese boat, the Fuku­shima Maru, that docks in Honolulu three times a year. Heading home: The jet ski was transported back to Honolulu (above) in May, and this Sunday put on a boat to return to Japan . Devastation: The craft's owner, Tomo­mune Matsu­naga, lost his home and most of his personal possessions as a result of the natural disaster (above), which occurred on March 11, 2011 . The captain, Shigeki Kuwabara, agreed to transport the jet ski and, on Sunday, when the boat left Honolulu for Japan, the craft was hoisted aboard, set to reunite with its owner on November 11 after another long trip across then Pacific Ocean. There is no word yet on what Matsu­naga, who lives in temporary housing in Iwaki City, plans to do with his craft when he gets it back.","A jet ski lost by a man who lived in Fukushima, Japan, during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami washed ashore in the Johnston Atoll .

"They have been banished under low-carb diets and maligned nearly as much as bread. But potatoes aren't necessarily bad for the waistline - and could actually help us lose weight, a study claims. Dieters who included potatoes in their meal plans all lost weight - as long as they reduced their overall calorie intake, researchers found. Dieters who included potatoes in their meals all lost weight if they reduced calories, a study found . The scientists concluded there is no evidence that potatoes lead to weight gain if they are prepared in a healthy manner. The researchers wanted to understand the role of lowering calories and the glycemic index (GI) affected weight loss, when potatoes are included in the diet. The glycemic index is a scale of zero to 100 representing how quickly glucose is released into the bloodstream after eating carbohydrates. Eating high GI foods such as white bread and white rice causes a spike in blood sugar levels as glucose is released quickly into the bloodstream, followed by a slump when insulin is released to control it. Low GI foods, such as wholegrain bread, porridge and brown rice, break down slowly during digestion, making dieters feel fuller for longer and stabilising blood sugar levels. As part of the study, 90 overweight men and women were split into three groups. The first group was told to reduce their calories but eat high GI foods. A medium-sized potato contains 110 calories . One medium-size potato with its skin on contains: . Just 110 calories per serving . More potassium (620g) than a banana . Almost half the daily value of vitamin C (45 per cent) Contains no fat, sodium or cholesterol . The second group was told to reduce their calories but eat low GI foods. People in the third group could eat whatever they wanted, with no restrictions on calories or GI foods. All three groups were given potatoes, healthy recipes and told to eat five to seven servings of potatoes each week. At the end of the 12-week study period, the researchers found all three groups had lost weight and there was no significant difference in weight loss between the groups. Interestingly, even the control group reduced their calories and lost weight - despite not being provided with a specific calorie restriction. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the research was funded by The United States Potato Board, which represents more than 2,500 U.S. potato growers and handlers. However it was published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition . 'There is no evidence that potatoes, when prepared in a healthful manner, contribute to weight gain. In fact, we are seeing that they can be part of a weight loss program' the researchers said . Lead researcher Dr Britt Burton-Freeman, of the Illinois Institute of Technology said: 'Some people have questioned the role of potatoes in a weight loss regimen because of the vegetable's designation as a high glycemic index food. 'However, the results of this study confirm what health professionals and nutrition experts have said for years: it is not about eliminating a certain food or food groups, rather, it is reducing calories that count.' He added: 'There is no evidence that potatoes, when prepared in a healthful manner, contribute to weight gain. In fact, we are seeing that they can be part of a weight loss program.' His co-researcher Dr Tissa Kappagoda, of the University of California at Davis, added: 'The fact that all groups, even the control group, lost weight is a curious finding and provides cause for future research.'","Study looked at dieters eating low calories and high GI or low GI foods .

"Crash-test dummies are packing on the pounds to better reflect the expanding waistlines and larger rear ends of many Americans. Manufacturer Humanetics has developed the new model after studies found that obese drivers are 78 percent more likely to die in a car crash. Dummies have traditionally been modeled on a person weighing about 167 pounds with a healthy body mass index. Scroll down for video . Super size me! Dummies have traditionally been modeled on a person weighing about 167 pounds, left, but manufacturer Humanetics has developed a 273 pound model, right, to better reflect expanding waistlines . The new super-sized dummies are based on the measurements of a 273-pound person with a BMI of 35. A BMI of over 30 is considered morbidly obese by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seat belts, air bags and other safety features have all been designed for thinner people and don’t fit larger people in the same way, Chris O' Connor, CEO of Humanetics, told ABC. ‘Typically you want someone in a very tight position with their rear against the back of the seat and the seat belt tight to the pelvis,’ he said. ‘An obese person has more mass around midsection and a larger rear which pushes them out of position. They sit further forward and the belt does not grasp the pelvis as easily.’ A similar conclusion was reached in a 2010 study from the University at Buffalo and Erie County Medical Center. Tight squeeze: Seat belts, air bags and other safety features have all traditionally been designed for thinner people and don’t fit larger people in the same way, according to Humanetics . The study, which analyzed data from more than 150,000 car crashes in the U.S. between 2000 to 2005, found that moderately obese drivers faced a 21 percent increased risk of death, and morbidly obese drivers faced a 56 percent increased risk of death. ‘Crash test dummies have saved lives and provided invaluable data on how human bodies react to crashes, but they are designed to represent normal-weight individuals,’ sais lead author Dr. Dietrich Jehle at the time. With more than 70 percent of Americans now clashed as either overweight or obese, according to the CDC, O’Conner said the death risk for obese people in cars is a serious problem that must be addressed despite fatal accidents being at historic lows. ‘We need to find a way to make cars safer for everyone, regardless of size,’ he said. The data used to create the new dummies also indicated that obese female drivers had double the risk of becoming a fatality compared with obese men. The larger dummies are expected to become available to manufacturers for use in testing  sometime next year. Humanetics has also been developing an age-appropriate dummy to better reflect our aging population.","Crash-test dummies are packing on the pounds to better reflect the expanding waistlines and larger rear ends of many Americans .

"Will children of the future be taught solely by a computer? That could be a possibility, according to Google's vice-president of research Alfred Spector. He said he thinks apps and technologies that are widely derided as being distracting could actually improve how we learn. And he says this may lead to a future where students do not need to go to school in order to get a formal education. Google's Alfred Spector (shown) says technology could replace teachers in future. He made the comments at the World-Changing Ideas Summit in New York. Tech we usually find distracting could be used to help students learn. He says even simple apps could improve their educational experience (stock image shown) Speaking at the BBC's World-Changing Ideas Summit in New York earlier this week, he said even simple apps could improve education. He points to apps already on the market like Duolingo, which teaches languages through games, as beginning the shift to technology-based learning. Learning to read Braille - the tactile writing system used by people who are blind and visually impaired - is notoriously difficult. To make this a little easier, researchers have designed vibrating gloves that help people learn to read and write Braille with minimal effort. Vibrating motors at the knuckle of each finger in the gloves buzz to tell a wearer to press a corresponding key, and the system tells them which letter they are typing. 'The process is based on passive haptic learning (PHL),' said Thad Starner, a Georgia Tech professor involved in the project. 'We've learned that people can acquire motor skills through vibrations without devoting active attention to their hands.' And he says that personal artificially intelligent tutors could be the next step to raise education levels for students even more. 'If it were the case that technology could become custom tutors, then it's possible to imagine enormous improvements in educational attainment,' he said. And he continued that video games could be used to take the boredom out of studying, creating environments in which learning can be exciting. 'We have user interfaces that are so exciting that people play video games for hours and hours a day, and they could be educated by them,' he said. Social networks could also be used to increase students' social skills, helping them communicate with one another more easily. Ultimately, Mr Spector says that these technologies combined could eradicate the need for schools. 'In the past it seemed you had to go to a school to get formal education - there was no choice but to go to isolated places to be educated, but now we don't have to do that,' he said. 'We may choose to but we don't have to.' Mr Spector (left) also says video games could also be used to take the boredom out of studying. And it may lead to a future where AI serves as personal tutors. Ultimately he says this may reduce the need for school (stock image shown right) both for educational needs and socially as well thanks to social networks .","Google's Alfred Spector says technology could replace teachers .

"Linda Locking, 36, stole £5,000 from Nutcombe Plumbing in the few months she worked there . A bookkeeper who stole thousands of pounds from a plumbing firm was caught after labelling a payment of £2,000 into her account 'Happy Christmas'. Linda Locking, 36, had only been working for  family-run plumbing business Nutcombe Plumbing in Harston, Cambridge, for a few months when she started helping herself to cash. The company had even loaned the mother-of-three £750 for car repairs after she claimed she had money trouble. Despite that Locking, from Cambridge, dishonestly transferred 22 small amounts of money into her personal account. She was caught in December 2013 when she transferred £2,000 with the festive message. It was then discovered that she had stolen more than £5,000 from the firm in the short time she had been employed. The company spotted that and called police and Locking was charged with theft. She admitted theft when she appeared at Cambridge Magistrates' Court and was given an 18-week suspended sentence. Magistrates also ordered her to carry out 240 hours unpaid work and repay £5,000 to the company. Her solicitor told the court she was 'remorseful' and the crime had had a huge impact on her life.

"NBC's Nightly News has something they would like everyone to know: Weather forecaster Mike Seidel did not relieve himself in the snow. For the record: Brian Williams said that 'social media owes Mike Seidel an apology' over the incident . NBC's Brian Williams said on Monday's broadcast that Seidel 'was the victim of some wild misinformation' that floated after his aborted live report on a snowstorm in North Carolina on Saturday's edition of the network's national newscast. Anchor Lester Holt introduced Seidel, who apparently could not hear him or know that he was on camera. Seidel, who also works for The Weather Channel, had his back to the camera and was slightly hunched over, both hands near his waist. Holt quickly ended the report. The clip spread online and generated some media reports that suggested Seidel had been caught in the act of relieving himself, even though there was no evidence of that to the naked eye. 'Social media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology,' Williams said Monday, as Nightly News replayed the scene. Williams said Seidel had lost cellphone contact with NBC's control room, so he didn't know Holt had introduced him. The reporter turned his back to the camera — and to the wind — to dial his phone. 'That's when the rumors hit the Web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow,' Williams explained to the newscast's 8 million viewers, many of whom likely hadn't seen the clip in the first place.

"Simon Cowell may not be used to sharing the spotlight, but it seems he may have to after he was named joint top in a poll of America's highest earning TV personalities. X Factor founder Cowell was named in first place alongside America's Got Talent judge and shock jock Howard Stern, with both raking in around $95million in the 12 months to June. Cowell took the top spot despite Fox canceling the U.S. version of his show after he walked away from the project, and after walking away from the America's Got Talent competition. Simon Cowell and Howard Stern both made $95million from their entertainment empires in the 12 months to July according to Forbes, who took data from their agents, lawyers and managers . Oprah Winfrey, once the highest earner in 2012 on $165million, has since slipped to fourth place with $82million, behind the likes of Glenn Beck . In third place was controversial right-wing mouthpiece and ex-Fox News commentator Glenn Beck, earning an impressive $90million. Forbes magazine spoke to agents, managers and lawyers of each celebrity to come up with estimates for their entertainment-related earnings. 1. Simon Cowell - $95million . 1. Howard Stern - $95 million . 3. Glenn Beck - $90 million . 4. Oprah Winfrey - $82 million . 5. Phil McGraw - $77million . 6. Ellen DeGeneres - $70 million . 7. Rush Limbaugh - $66 million . 8. Ryan Seacrest - $65 million . 9. Gordon Ramsay - $47 million . 10. Judge Judy Sheindlin - $47 million . According to their data Oprah Winfrey earned $82million in the last year, putting her in fourth place, a dramatic fall from the 2012 list in which she was named top with earnings of $165million. Phil McGraw - more commonly known as Dr Phil - is in fifth place with earnings of $77million. Ellen DeGeneres, the chat show host and comic, ranks sixth with $70million, followed by Rush Limbaugh on $66million and Ryan Seacrest on $65million. Scottish chef Gordon Ramsay, host of Hell's Kitchen USA, came in at number nine with entertainment earnings estimated at $47million, while Judge Judy Sheindlin - the host of real-life courtroom drama show Judge Judy, completed the top ten with earnings of $47 million dollars. As well as sitting on the judging panel for X Factor UK, Cowell also owns media production house and record label Syco, taking a cut from the earnings of every winner of the show. Stern, meanwhile, has dubbed himself the 'King Of All Media' for his success as a writer, producer and host, and is thought to earn around $15million a year for starring on America's Got Talent. Ellen DeGeneres (centre left, in white), the chat show host and comic, fell just outside the top five with $70million earnings, despite high-profile gigs such as hosting the 2014 Oscars (pictured) Gordon Ramsay earned $47million from his entertainment work in the last 12 months alone, not including the takings from his restaurant empire . While Glenn Beck is less prominent on television screens ever since he quit Fox in 2011, but now charges fans $10-a-month in order to access his online opinion site, The Blaze. Despite spending 12 years on the air, Dr Phil still ranks high on the list thanks to his ability to track down high-profile interviewees, such as V Stiviano - the girlfriend of former Clippers owner Donald Sterling who recorded him making racist remarks.","Glenn Beck  in third place with earnings from website and public speaking .

"A mother has been given permission to change the surname of her three-year-old twin sons because of the 'bizarre conduct' of their father. The woman, who cannot be named,  told a family court judge that her children they needed protecting from their father's internet blogging 'activities'. Judge Ross Duggan said the man, who had not seen the children for a year after separating from his wife, is embroiled in litigation about what contact he should have with them. Ruling: A mother will be allowed to change the surname of her twins because of the 'bizarre conduct' of their father on his blog (posed by model) He said the man had a 'perception of martyrdom' and had created a 'protest blog' which he updated 'virtually daily'. Judge Duggan said the man had 'taken to referring' to his estranged wife as 'a drug-addicted alcoholic who suffered from sexually transmitted diseases'. He also said he had posted a medical report relating to one his children, had posted 'extensive details' of litigation issues and had posted his sons' names. The judge said the man had 'let himself down' - and said his 'activity' had been 'severely damaging' to the welfare of the children. And he concluded that allowing the woman to change the children's names was 'necessary and proportionate'. Ruling: The Royal Courts of Justice in London, which has a family division where statements on rulings of family matters are often read out . Detail of the case has emerged in a ruling by Judge Duggan following a hearing in Preston, Lancashire. The judge said the family could not be identified. 'I am persuaded that the desirable preservation of a symbol of a paternal link through the preservation of the surname has to give way to the protection of the children from the father's publication steps,' said Judge Duggan. 'I cannot allow a situation in which the children at an older age and their friends can chance upon web-based insults to the mother ... or anything else that the father decides to publish from time to time in association with their name. 'It seems I cannot realistically stop the father's activities at source but I can stop the harmful consequences, which are, of course, associated with the identification of this material alongside the names of the children. 'In this context, in the children's best interests, it is necessary and proportionate to allow their change of name.'","Mother argued her children needed protecting from their father's blog .

"MAN CITY MUST DOMINATE IN EUROPE TO KEEP SHEIKH MANSOUR SATISFIED . JENKINSON, GAYLE AND WICKHAM DESERVE ENGLAND RECOGNITION . In May 2013 Ashley Cole left the Wembley pitch having captained England against the Republic of Ireland. He said this: 'It’s a very proud moment for me and one I’ll never forget. I wanted to be captain, it was a dream come true. I’ve lived a little boy’s dream today.' Less than a year on Cole has retired from international football, after he got the dreaded call from Roy Hodgson, telling him he wouldn’t be going to the World Cup. Where did it all go wrong? I blame Jose Mourinho – he’s had a detrimental effect on Cole’s career twice now, and that’s sackable in my book. VIDEO Scroll down to watch 'Jose: I don't know if Terry, Lampard and Cole are finished' Dream come true: Ashley Cole is presented with a golden cap by England manager Roy Hodgson to mark a century of caps for the national team prior to the friendly with the Republic of Ireland last May . Lionheart: Cole has been England's first choice left-back for a decade but announced his international retirement after being omitted from the World Cup squad . Ruined: Jose Mourinho ended Cole's World Cup chances by making him a bit-part player at Chelsea this season . Cole was a marauding, dynamic, attacking full-back at Arsenal. He was sometimes the Gunners’ biggest threat – here’s one example: he was described as Arsenal’s 'most menacing attacker' when he got the winner at Manchester City in September 2004, which is incredible when you think that Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry, Freddie Ljungberg and Jose Antonio Reyes were all playing that day. Cole claimed Arsenal went back on a promise so off he went to Chelsea where Mourinho barely let him go over the halfway line. He regularly got into the opposition box at Arsenal – he has never scored for a Mourinho team. Cole’s game changed – he won medals at Chelsea of course, but his development hasn't reached a high level - he should have gone on to be the very best attacking full-back in the world for a decade. Danger man: Cole was described as the 'most menacing attacker' on the field when Arsenal won 1-0 at Manchester City back in September 2004 (pictured) On the rampage: Cole in action for England during a World Cup qualifier with Wales at Old Trafford in 2004 . Forward thinker: Cole takes on the Albanian defence in a World Cup qualifier back in March 2001 . Mourinho returned and single-handedly wrecked any chance Cole had of going to another World Cup. He picked a right-back at left-back, leaving Ashley out in the cold. Sure, Azpilicueta had a good season, but ultimately Chelsea had an unsuccessful season. Was it worth it? What point was Jose making by leaving Cole out? Cole played over 50 games in 2012-13, and ended the season as England captain. He had no reason to think a year on he wouldn’t be a Chelsea regular, and wouldn’t be going to the World Cup. Competition: Cole's place at left-back has been taken by Cesar Azpilicueta this season, a natural right-back . Solid: The Spaniard has adapted well to the Premier League and Cole has been unable to regain his place . When he looks back on his career, Cole will be able to count a lot of medals – he has won everything the club game can bring. But he will also realise Mourinho ruined his career not once, but twice. I’m gutted for Cole, I’ve interviewed him a few times but I don’t know him as a person. As a footballer he has amazing talent. Mourinho has robbed him of the chance to be the undisputed best player in his position in the world by not allowing him to express himself on the pitch. And now the Chelsea manager has robbed Cole of a chance to play at another World Cup.","Ashley Cole announced his retirement from England duty .

"Banks are still 'too big to fail' six years after lenders caused a financial . meltdown that led to the recession, according to regulators who called . the the institutions' plans to avoid future bailouts . 'unrealistic.' The declaration leaves open the possibility for harsh punishments. The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation criticized 11 financial institutions Tuesday morning over plans they have submitted that detail how each institution would resolve their financial obligations and wind down operations in the event of a bankruptcy. Deficient: Regulators attacked plans by 11 of the largest financial institutions as not 'credible,' leaving open the possibility of sanctions . Harsh criticism: FDIC Vice Chair Thomas Hoenig ripped into the banks' living wills as being 'deficient' for failing to plan realistically without the aid of taxpayers . The creation of living wills was imposed on large banks in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when some of the largest banks required government bailouts in order to stave off a chain of bankruptcies that would have crippled the global financial system. The New York Times reports that the FDIC and the Fed sent letters to Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and eight other banks critical of the plans that were submitted in 2013. Some of these contingency plans are tens of thousands of pages long, yet the FDIC blasted them as 'deficient' and unable to bring a bank into bankruptcy 'without precipitating a financial crisis.' “The plans provide no credible or clear path through bankruptcy that doesn’t require unrealistic assumptions and direct or indirect public support,” FDIC Vice Chair Thomas Hoenig said in a statement. The Financial Times reports that the FDIC's remark that living wills are not 'credible' might open up the largest banks to significant intervention by government regulators. However, the Fed's language was more conciliatory, urging banks to remedy the 'shortcomings' of their living will plans before the Fed joined the FDIC in calling the plans not credible. The possible punishments banks face are 'more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements' or even being forced by regulators to sell off investments to unaffiliated institutions. Regulators recently came under fire from Congress when Senator Elizabeth Warren lit into Fed Chair Janet Yellen last month. Trading fire: Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen was questioned by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts over the agency moving slowly to regulate banks like JPMorgan . The Massachusetts senator has been critical of big banks before, and during a lively hearing televised on C-Span went after the Fed failing to get a workable living will out of JPMorgan Chase. 'Have they ever gotten to a plan that you can say with a straight face is credible?' demanded Warren. 'I've understood this to be a process, these are extremely complex documents to produce,' Yellen responded. As the Huffington Post points out, Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew admitted in 2013 that the US had not done enough to eliminate the threat of financial institutions being so big that a bankruptcy could trigger another panic in the global financial markets. Speaking at the Pew Charitable Trusts at the end of the year, Lew said Wall Street reform needed to balance 'maintaining deep, liquid financial markets that promote strong credit creation and lending, and protecting our economy and the American taxpayer from excessive risk-taking.' President Obama has previously touted living wills as proof that Wall Street could no longer 'play by its own set of rules' according to the Chicago Tribune. Nine financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, submitted living wills in 2012, none were deemed 'not credible' at the time.","The Federal Reserve and FDIC attacked 11 lenders for not coming up with realistic plans in case of bankruptcy .

Research has shown that ‘conversation partners’, who can see a driver’s view, moderated their conversation according to what was happening on the road, making the driver more aware of the road. Scientists claim that talking to a passenger who can see what the driver sees (pictured) may boost driving safety. Research has shown that ‘conversation partners’ who could see a driver’s view moderated their conversation according to what was happening on the road, making the driver more aware of the road . ‘We’ve done years of study on driver distraction and previous studies suggest that passengers often aren’t distracting,’ said Arthur Kramer, University of Illinois psychology professor and Beckman Institute director. ‘In fact, passengers can be helpful, especially if they’re adults who have had experience and also are active drivers themselves.’ For the study, the scientists set up four driving scenarios in a driving simulator: a driver alone, a driver speaking to a passenger, a driver speaking to someone on a hands-free mobile, and a driver speaking to someone who could see the driver and observe the driving scene via hands-free videophone. The drivers encountered various driving challenges that included merging and navigating around unpredictable drivers in other cars, in the simulation. The researchers tracked the drivers’ lateral moves, distance from other cars, speed, collisions, and ability to find and take a designated exit. They also recorded speech and tracked the driver’s eye movements. Researchers were not surprised to find that driving alone was the safest option. There were significantly fewer collisions when drivers were alone in the simulated car than when they were speaking to a passenger in the car, but passengers helped drivers find their exits and improved their memory of road signs . They were not surprised to find that driving alone was the safest option, which previous studies have already shown. There were significantly fewer collisions when drivers were alone in the simulated car than when they were speaking to a passenger in the car, according to the study, published in the journal Psychological Science. Passengers helped drivers find their exits and improved their memory of road signs, but they detracted from overall safety, including the avoidance of collisions, Professor Kramer said. This means that passengers make people a safer driver compared to when they're using a mobile, but it is not the safest option. The study found that speaking to someone on a mobile was the most dangerous of the scenarios, more than tripling the likelihood of a collision. The most interesting results, however, occurred when a driver spoke to someone who wasn’t in the car but who could see what was happening via videophone. Graduate student John Gaspar explained: ‘Drivers were less likely to be involved in a collision when their remote partner could see what they were seeing,’ Gaspar said. ‘And this benefit seems to be driven by changes in the way partners talked to the driver.’ The study found that speaking to someone on a mobile (stock image) was the most dangerous of the scenarios, more than tripling the likelihood of a collision . Seeing the driver and watching what was going on in traffic during the conversation allowed the non-driving partner to stop speaking, for example, when something unexpected occurred on the road, or to point out a situation that might be dangerous. ‘Conversations with a partner on the videophone were very similar to conversations with a passenger,’ he said. The findings demonstrate that a passenger or conversation partner can contribute significantly to the safety of the driving experience, Professor Kramer said. ‘There is no condition in which having the videophone information is worse than speaking on a cell phone; the collisions are reduced 40 or 50 per cent - that’s pretty big,’ he said. ‘I’m not suggesting people speak on cell phones while driving, but if the driver is speaking to someone who is not in the car, it would be helpful for the conversation partner to have information about what the driver is seeing and doing.’ A company has developed a 'texting gun' that can recognise the frequency of a text message, allowing police to fine people . One company claims to have developed a ‘texting gun’ that can recognise the frequency of a text message, allowing police to fine people for doing it. Everyone knows that texting while driving is dangerous.In the UK it is illegal to use your phone at all when driving, while the law varies in the US from state to state - most allow phone calls but no texting. Drivers caught using a phone in the UK can be charged up to £1,000 ($1,640) and also lose their license - although hands-free kits and sat navs are allowed. These inconsistencies can make it difficult for police to work out if a person is being distracted by their phone or not. This led to Virginia-based ComSonics to design a gun that can detect frequencies. The device, called the Sniffer Sleuth II, is currently in production although no release date or price has been announced yet. According to the Virginian-Pilot, it can discern the different frequencies from a text message, phone call and data transfer. It apparently uses similar technology used by cable repairmen to find where a cable is damaged, who look for transmission ‘leaks’. The device can apparently even work out which person in the car is texting, so it will not alert police to issue a fine if it spots frequencies from a passenger.","Study shows‘conversation partners’ who can see a driver’s view moderated their conversation according to what was happening on the road .

"Manchester United are hoping to announce Louis van Gaal as their new manager next week, with Ed Woodward conducting a conference call with investors on Thursday. United have been tracking the Holland coach for weeks and are edging closer to revealing their new man. Woodward claimed that wages are set to rise at Old Trafford this summer, while work is already 'being done' on signing new players. Host commentator . If you don't fancy scrolling down and reading my running account, click on the link above for Ashley Clements' summary. Thanks for joining. Should be a very interesting few weeks at Manchester United. Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward claims transfer deals are in the process of 'being done' at Old Trafford and that the club will be 'active' in the summer window. An announcement on Louis van Gaal becoming David Moyes' successor will be made 'in due course', while the cost of not qualifying for next season's Champions League will cost the club upwards of £30million. But despite that, they intend to spend big on wages, with a third quarter percentage increase in the 'high-teens' as a recruitment drives takes hold. And that concludes the conference call. Nothing specific on Louis van Gaal. Woodward: We will be active in the transfer market. Deals are being done, but we haven't committed yet. Moyes' compensation will be revealed in good time but is in the 'single digit millions'. There is no tangible link between investment in the squad and the company. Season tickets are selling well. Woodward indicates the goal at Manchester United is to qualify for the 2015-16 Champions League. We knew that, but good to have it in black and white. Woodward says impact of not qualifying for Europe will cost club 'mid-£30m's' in 2015. 'That relates to broadcast money. 'Our aim absolutely is to get back into the Champions League.' 'Due to appearance fees and negotiations, we expect the wage increase [as a percentage] to be high-teens, not mid-teens. We expect wages to go up in the fourth quarter. 'We expect there to be an inflation in player wages. We're looking at investing this summer anyway.' 'We continue to support FFP.' Wages expected to be higher than United had previously expected for the fourth quarter. United are reiterating that the third quarter revenue is a record for the club. 'We finished a very disappointing seventh. Everyone at the club are working hard to ensure we perform as expected next year. 'We're very grateful to Ryan Giggs for taking on the reins on an interim basis. 'We're now focused on bringing in a new manager and expect to make an announcement in due course. In the meantime we continue to be active in the transfer market.' Ah, here we go... there will be a Q&A session after an initial club presentation. We'll be summarising the best bits. Gone one o'clock and no sign! Scandal! Almost ready to kick off, we've been very politely informed. Chris Wheeler: Ryan Giggs has been offered the job of Louis van Gaal’s No 2 at Manchester United after holding secret talks at the Dutchman’s penthouse apartment. Giggs was seen coming out of a hotel in the seaside town of Noordwijk, 20 miles southwest of Amsterdam, and it is understood that the discussions took place at Van Gaal’s luxury home a few hundred yards away. Ian Ladyman: Manchester United will not name Louis van Gaal as their new manager until next week. The Barclays Premier League club have agreed most of the details of the 62-year-old’s new contract at Old Trafford and had hoped to officially announce the appointment on Thursday. It is understood, however, that United have not yet managed to agree upon all the specifics with their incoming manager. The key nugget to take away from that announcement then is the fact that United's third quarter revenue is up 26 per cent to £115.5 million. Almost one-and-a-half Gareth Bales. Oh, and the debt's down to £351.7m too. Manchester United say they have the financial power to reinforce the squad following their worst Premier League season. The team went from champions to a seventh-place finish and fired manager David Moyes less than 10 months after succeeding Alex Ferguson. But in the first three months of 2014, as United reached the Champions League quarterfinals and new sponsorship deals were made, revenue rose by 26 percent to £115.5 million. United vice chairman Ed Woodward says 'impressive year over year growth' ensures they are in a 'healthy financial position to continue to invest in the squad.' Woodward says the club is 'working hard to ensure the team is back challenging for the title and trophies.' [Report from Rob Harris, AP] . Good afternoon all. This ought to be an interesting interlude to your day - Ed Woodward is holding the Manchester United PLC Earnings conference call at one o'clock. The chief executive will doubtless be asked tricky questions on David Moyes' sacking and the imminent arrival of Louis van Gaal. There are other issues enveloping the club at the moment - including player contracts - which may be brought up by investors.","Manchester United hope to confirm Van Gaal's appointment next week .

"In the Arizona desert the first of Qantas's aged fleet of Boeing 767s jets are landing ...for the last time. It's called the 'great aeroplane graveyard' and like thousands of decommissioned military and passenger craft before them, it's where Qantas's reliable but costly 767 'workhorses' will retire. In the dust of a former airforce base in Victorville, California. 'Picture hot winds and shifting desert sands, prairy dogs and rattlesnakes  - and all you can hear is the hum of thousands of rusting propellers turning in the wind,'  says 60 Minutes Presenter Charles Wooley, who recently took a ticket on an empty 767  to it's final resting place at the Southern California Logistics Airport.  'Let's just say I wouldn't recommend it as a tourist destination - it's a very eery place.' Scroll down for video . Aeroplane graveyard: Qantas's aged fleet of Boeing 767s retiring to a former airforce base in Victorville, California, USA. A birds eye view of the Victorville 'boneyard' for old planes in California, USA. Qantas announced plans for all nine of its remaining 767 fleet to be retired by the end of 2014, nine months earlier than originally planned. The jets have already outlived their predicted 2010 used-by date and are now too costly to keep in the air. In their place, Qantas have chosen the more fuel-efficient 787 Dreamliners. Television Presenter Charles Wooley enjoyed the cabin to himself on one of the last 787 flights, named 'Charlie 1' by the crew. 'It was a bit like the Twilight Zone, I was half-expecting to see a monkey appear on the wing,' he said. 'Actually it was an all-female crew, it was symbolic since the making of the Boeing 767 in the 1980s coincided with the time women really began flying passenger planes.' 'When we landed, I met all my old friends out there. I must have been on those jets more than a hundred times over the years with 60 minutes,' says Wooley. 'These were masterpieces of 20th century engineering.' What will happen to them now? Engineers will 'rip the guts out of some', others will be wrapped up to keep their engines intact. 'One guy out there says to me: ""Well Charlie, some might be picked up by a billionaire, but I'd say most will end up as beer cans,'"" says Wooley. Scroll down for video . The Flying Kangaroos in Arizona now look much like any other old jet, with the bounding marsupials on their tails painted out in red. Wooley says it was hard to film at the graveyard because 'Boeing shareholders don't like seeing all these mothballs sitting around.' 'Airlines, like TV companies these days, are never too far away from bankruptcy - but it's all about fuel, cheaper planes that are much more economical to continue to fly,' he says. And it's not all bad news for the airline industry. According to Wooley, Boeing are producing 42 new Dreamliner craft at their plant in Seattle every month. Presenter Charles Wooley and the crew .

"A 6-year-old Kansas City girl has died in a drive-by shooting at a convenience store in the southern part of the city. Police say Angel Hooper was wounded Friday night when someone in a passing vehicle fired multiple rounds into the parking lot of a 7-Eleven store. The little girl's dad,  29-year-old Booker Hooper, had just bought angle a pack of bubblegum inside.  She was opening the package in the parking lot when she was hit. Angle was rushed to a hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after. Tragedy: Angel Hooper, 6, was killed by a drive-by shooter outside a Kansas City 7-Eleven store . Distraught relatives comfort each other near the spot where Angel was shot . Angel loved reading and math. Her favorite books were the Berenstain Bears series .

"Steve Bruce is aiming to cause an upset in Saturday's FA Cup final, and it will make a welcome change from his last visit to Wembley, if he does. The upset then was on a purely personal level, and he was on the receiving end after a ruthlessly blunt message from Sir Alex Ferguson an hour or so before kick-off in the 1996 final against Liverpool. Traditionally turned out in a specially-tailored Cup final suit, Bruce was soaking up the atmosphere with his Manchester United team-mates when Ferguson took him aside and told him he wouldn’t be in the team. Not that afternoon, not ever again. All smiles: Hull manager Steve Bruce is hoping Saturday's FA Cup final can erase his Wembley misery . Road to Wembley: Hull take on Premier League rivals Arsenal in the FA Cup final on Saturday . Tough to take: Bruce was told his Manchester United career was over shortly before the '96 FA Cup final . A brief spell at Birmingham followed, but ask him to reflect on a glittering playing career, and Hull City’s manager will pinpoint that brief conversation on the Wembley turf as the moment it all ended. As he prepares to lead Hull out against Arsenal, he hopes his return to a rebuilt Wembley will provide him with the sharpest of contrasts, emotionally. Asked about the pain of losing to a Paul Rideout goal against Everton in ’95, the former United skipper said: ‘The ’96 final was worse, when Fergie told me on the pitch I wasn’t playing. That’s when I found out. It was about half-one. I’d had a hamstring and had missed the previous three weeks, but, even so, it wasn’t easy to accept. ‘He just told me there and then. To be fair to him, it was his way of saying: ‘""Steve, thanks very much, this is it for you."" Sure enough, it was. It was the most disappointing thing for me, the most disappointing moment of my career. A couple of years earlier, I became the first English player to lift the double, which was a brilliant moment for me personally, but this was the other extreme. Red Devil: Bruce, pictured playing against Blackburn in 1995, spent nine seasons at Old Trafford . ‘He left it that late for a reason, and it is something I have taken into management. If you name your team at the beginning of the week, you are going to have 11 ecstatic players and 11 absolutely destroyed for the rest of the build-up. He would always leave it late for big games, and that was his way of keeping everyone on their toes until shortly before kick-off. Mind you, it has taken me 20 years to get over it! ‘Looking back, it was his way of breaking it to me that I wasn’t just missing the Cup final. He was saying your time’s up, mate. For me, that was the end of my career. I stood there, and it began dawning on me that I was finished at Old Trafford. It was a case of saying to myself: “Look Steve, you’re 36, you’ve had a fantastic innings, but that’s it.” I had to try and take all that in, but it wasn’t easy. ‘Eric Cantona scored the winner late on, but I couldn’t even tell you whether I got a medal. Apparently I did, but I don’t regard it as the same, because I didn’t take part in the final. I suppose if you play in the earlier rounds, you deserve it, but everyone wants to be involved in the final. That’s just human nature. Match-winner: Eric Cantona celebrates after scoring against Liverpool in the '96 final but Bruce admits he couldn't say whether he received a medal or not . ‘I’ll have to do the same to some of my players, and tell them they’re not in the team, and I’m not looking forward to it. It doesn’t matter whether you put them in an office, a room somewhere or out on the pitch, it’s something they won’t want to hear. If they’ve got any professional pride about them, which these boys have, they are going to be desperately disappointed. ‘From a personal perspective, much as my last visit hit me hard, this one could more than make amends. Without question, there is more pride and satisfaction from going to Wembley as a manager than as a player, and if we can win, it would be the highlight of my career. ‘Somehow, it has lost its glamour over the past 15 years, but when you get to the semi-final and final, it is still something to enjoy and savour. Behold the beauty of the FA Cup is upon us. Mighty Arsenal against tiny Hull. That, for me, is what makes it great.’ Special day: Hull City's players at Humberside Airport en route to London ahead of Saturday's FA Cup Final . Waiting game: Hull players stand and wait with their luggage before boarding a flight to London . Bruce provided an insight into his relationship with controversial owner Assem Allam and revealed that he thought long and hard before accepting his job offer. ‘After what happened at Sunderland, the next job was always going to be crucial to me, and when this one came up, a lot of my pals said: “Steve, are you sure?”,’ he recalled. ‘They were a mid-Championship side at best, and when I went to the chairman’s house, here in Hull, he offered me a salary which I think I was earning in 1984! But I actually found that quite endearing. I said: “Do you want me to do it for nothing?” There was almost a bit of naivety about him, and I just thought that was terrific after some of the things I’d experienced as a manager. Giving: Hull City chairman Assem Allam gave a local hospital in Hull £7million last week . ‘What can I tell you about him? He doesn’t have a mobile phone, for one thing. In fact, he hasn’t got anything new-fangled, really. He considers a mobile an intrusion in his life, but at least it means I can’t get sacked by text message. ‘He has been here 50 years and lives three miles away, and he gave the local hospital £7million last week. He has given more to this community than probably anyone has, and he is a genuinely nice man. ‘I don’t think he could ever envisage we would reach an FA Cup final, but then none of us could. I’m delighted for him, just as I am for the players and supporters. But the job’s not done yet. It’s only a great day at Wembley if you win. That’s the challenge we face, finding a way of beating Arsenal.’","Steve Bruce leads Hull City into the FA Cup final against Arsenal on Saturday .

"This gruesome image of a tumour growing from a cigarette is part of the Government's latest attempt to get millions of Britons to stop smoking. The new Department of Health campaign launched today is in response to statistics which show more than a third of smokers still think the health risks are greatly exaggerated. This is despite the fact that smoking is still the biggest cause of premature death, responsible for taking more than 100,000 lives in the UK every year. Scroll down to watch the ad . The Department of Health hopes the image of a tumour growing from a cigarette will prompt some of Britain's eight million smokers to quit . Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, insisted the startling images in the ads are necessary . The latest campaign will focus on the fact that every 15 cigarettes smoked causes a mutation that can lead to cancer, according to the Department of Health (DoH). Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies said smokers play Russian roulette with every cigarette. 'This is a hard-hitting campaign to get at the hidden harms of smoking,' she said. 'People will see a man smoking and then a cancer growing out of the cigarette. That is what happens in people's bodies. 'One-in-two smokers die from smoking, most from cancer. We know that people don't personalise the harms of smoking and don't understand what's happening in their bodies. This will show them.' The latest campaign will focus on the fact that smoking just 15 cigarettes can cause a mutation than can lead to cancerous tumours . About two thirds of the nation’s 8million smokers say they want to quit and the campaign urges them to . pick up a free NHS Quit Kit from pharmacies. The last graphic adverts, in 2004, showed fatty deposits being squeezed from a smoker's artery and fat dripping from the end of cigarettes. The following eight years have seen softer campaigns but the DoH says it believes the time is right to deliver a stronger message. Dame Sally said: 'It is extremely worrying that people still underestimate the serious health harms associated with smoking. 'We want smokers to understand that each packet of cigarettes increases their risk of cancer.' The campaign, which cost £2.7 million, will run for nine weeks on television, billboards and online. Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, insisted the startling images in the ads are necessary. 'We have got to reduce the impact that tobacco has on the lives of far too many people,' he said. 'It's not a lifestyle choice, it's an addiction that creeps into people's lives and results in death and disease. 'Giving up smoking can be extremely difficult, so providing extra motivation and reminding people of just how harmful the habit is can help smokers to take that first step in quitting for good.'","Department of Health ad, which cost £2.7m, will run for nine weeks on television, billboards and online .

"Rio Ferdinand has been the bedrock of Manchester United's defence for 12 seasons in a trophy-laden period at Old Trafford. The 35-year-old's honours include six Premier League titles, a Champions League, a Club World Cup and two League Cups, but despite all that he was told by United chief Ed Woodward on Sunday that he has no future at Old Trafford, making the 1-1 draw at Southampton his 455th and final match for the club. Here, Sportsmail looks back on Ferdinand's career in the red half of Manchester... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ferdinand talk about his future . The early days: Rio Ferdinand won his first Premier League title with Manchester United in 2002/03 (left) Ferdinand joined United in July 2002 . for £29.1million from Leeds - in what was the most expensive transfer . for an English player at the time. The defender got off to a dream debut season at the club making 28 league appearances as United won the 2002-03 Premier League title - finishing five points clear of second-placed Arsenal. The following season was met with controversy as Ferdinand was slapped with an eight-month ban by the FA in January 2004 after missing a drugs test. The sanction resulted in the England centre half missing the rest of the season and Euro 2004. Lean patch: Ferdinand finished third with United during the 2004/05 and 2005/06 seasons . After his ban, Ferdinand was a virtual . ever-present in the United defence as he played 31 times in the league . for the club as they finished third behind Jose Mourinho's Chelsea. They also finished third in . 2005-06 but it was better on a personal level  forFerdinand as he agreed a . new four-year deal and also scored his first goal for the club in . December 2005 against Wigan. United also beat Wigan 4-0 in the League Cup final at the Millennium Stadium to win their first piece of . silverware in three years. The stats: Ferdinand featured in 312 Premier League matches for United, winning six domestic titles . Double joy: Ferdinand was a virtual ever present as United won back-to-back league titles in 2007 and 2008 . The . 2006-07 and 2007-08 seasons were arguably Ferdinand's greatest in a . United shirt. Having formed a formidable partnership with Nemanja Vidic - . the duo provided the backbone for back-to-back Premier League . title successes. In the former campaign, Ferdinand made 33 league . appearances and 35 in the latter - chipping in with three goals and one . assist. The . 2007-08 season was extra special for the defender as he made 11 . appearances for Sir Alex Ferguson's side en route to winning the . Champions League final against Chelsea in Moscow. Three and easy: Ferdinand won his third successive Premier League title with United in 2008-09 (left) United . again proved they were the team to beat in 2008-09 as they won a third . consecutive Premier League title - however, limited the England . star to only 24 appearances. As defending champions of Europe's elite . competition, the defender again featured 11 times as the club lost 2-0 . in the showpiece to Barcelona in Rome. Back . injuries started to plague Ferdinand towards the end of his career and . this showed as he only made 13 league appearances the following season . as United lost the Premier League to Chelsea. Injury years: Back problems limited Ferdinand to less than 20 league games per season in 2009-10 and 2010-11 . Things . were to improve for Ferdinand though, as he made 19 appearances as the club . successfully regained their crown and eclipsed Liverpool's record of 18 . league titles. During the . 2011-12 season, the centre back played 30 times as United . dramatically lost the Premier League on the final day of the season to . their 'noisy neighbours' Manchester City. Last hurrah: Ferdinand won his final and sixth Premier League title in 2012-13 (left) United . responded in emphatic fashion the following campaign, storming their way . to a 20th English crown by 11 points from their city rivals.

"A furious woman launched a massive online campaign to force council chiefs to rip up an £80 hospital parking ticket handed to her father as her mother fought for her life. Heidi Weir, 34, a hair extension specialist, roared into action after her devastated father Derek Weir, 61, was targeted when he got back to his car at Queen's Hospital in Romford, Essex, just nine minutes after his ticket ran out. Red-faced council bosses have now performed an embarrassing U-turn after Miss Weir launched a huge internet campaign for justice. Heidi Weir (pictured) launched an online campaign after her father was slapped with a parking ticket while visiting her critically-ill mother in hospital. Mr Weir was just nine minutes late when he was handed the £80 fine . She created a special Facebook group when her distraught father had his fine upheld after receiving it while in an urgent meeting to discuss his critically ill wife, Natalie, 61. Mr Weir was called into the meeting with the ward sister and occupational therapist 30 minutes before his ticket ran out, but was assured the meeting would only take 15 minutes. As Mrs Weir lay battling for her life with bleeding to her brain, Mr Weir's meeting over-ran - and a parking warden pounced. On the advice of shocked hospital staff, he appealed against the fine. But both Mr Weir and his daughter say they were 'disgusted' to have their appeal rejected by the council, which runs the troubled £200m flagship hospital's car park. The authority said it would need proof of the crisis meeting last Wednesday on October 22. Miss Weir, of Chelmsford, turned to Facebook to share her thoughts - and her Hospital Parking group has attracted thousands. One post detailing the situation has received a staggering 125,000 'likes' so far - and almost 10,000 people have joined the group so far. Miss Weir slammed the council's 'inhumane, insensitive bureaucracy' and was flooded with messages of support and empathy from others who have also been singled out by jobsworths nationwide. The outraged mum-of-one wrote: 'I refuse to say to a ward sister, ""excuse me, can you stop saving that person's life, please, while you write me a letter to the council to say you called my dad into the meeting?""' Two days and 100,000 'likes' later, Mr Weir, of Romford, received an email out of the blue from Havering Council to arrange a refund. A council spokesman said: 'We are cancelling the ticket and refunding the money. 'We're sorry for any distress and upset caused to the family. We had asked for supporting evidence, which is usual practice. 'But we reviewed the case and concluded, given the circumstances, we could cancel the ticket without the additional evidence.' Queen's Hospital in Romford, Essex (pictured) where Mr Weir was given the £80 parking ticket . But it was too little too late for Miss Weir and she has now accused the under-fire authority of 'dropping their principles for publicity'. She said: 'It makes me even more mad. 'I'd have far more respect for them if they stuck to their guns, I don't care about our money. I care about all the people that don't have the energy to make the enormous fuss I have!' She now believes that hospital parking fees should be abolished altogether and 'will not rest' until she achieves her goal. Her mother is 'still fighting' for her life in hospital. In August the Department of Health issued new guidelines which told hospitals in England  to cut the cost of parking for certain groups - including relatives of people who are seriously ill. . Ministers said relatives of people who are seriously ill or have to stay in hospital for a long time should be given free parking or reduced charges. The guidelines state: 'Additional charges should only be imposed where reasonable and should be waived when overstaying is beyond the driver’s control (eg when treatment takes longer than planned.)'","Derek Weir was called into an urgent meeting to discuss wife's condition and returned to his car just minutes late to find the £80 parking ticket .

"A judge has granted a two-month trial delay for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , but denied a defense request to move his trial. Judge George O'Toole ruled on Wednesday night that the trial will begin January 5 instead of November 3. He said there's no reason to assume before the trial that a fair jury cannot be found in Massachusetts. Faces the death penalty: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will begin trial in Boston on January 5 instead of November 3 as previously planned and may face the death penalty if convicted . Defense wanted to move trial: The suspect's defense requested to move the trial from Boston for fear that media coverage of the bombings (pictured) would prevent fair trial . Defense attorneys had asked to have the trial moved to Washington, D.C., and delayed until at least September 2015. Prosecutors say 21-year-old Tsarnaev and his now-deceased older brother placed two pressure cooker bombs that exploded near the marathon's finish line last year. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured. Tsarnaev could face the death penalty if convicted. MBTA Officer Richard Donahue who almost bled to death in an April 19th firefight that killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the accused killer's older brother, told The Boston Herald he is relieved that the trial will begin soon. 'A burden has been lifted off all of us,' Donohue said. 'It’s important to kick it off.' The Tsaraevs also allegedly murdered a 26-year-old MIT officer Sean Collier on April 19. They are also accused of killing Martin Richard, 8, Lingzi Lu, 23, and Krystle Campbell, 29, three days earlier during the bombings on Boylston Street. A ballroom dancer who last her left foot during the bombings, Adrianne Haslet-Davis, told the Boston Herald she's 'happy' the trial won't ruin the holidays for survivors and victims' families. Trial will stay in Boston: Keeping the trial in Boston will allow survivors and families of the victims of the horrible Boston Marathon bombing (pictured) stay close to hope and among their support groups . She said that keeping the trial in Boston will give families 'solace.' 'The trial is where it should be. He needs to face his own death sentence where he was stupid enough to pull off what he did,' she said. 'I’m happy survivors can sleep in their own beds and be close to their support units,' she added. She also had something to say about Tsarnaev's right, or lack therof to decide where his trial will be held. 'He shouldn’t have any say in where the trial is,' she said. 'He’s fortunate enough to have people around him and to be able to fight for his life, because not all of us had that luxury.' 'This is what’s best for the people with PTSD who have to face this trial,' Haslet-Davis added. 'I’m glad none of us will have Thanksgiving in the courtroom. I’m glad the trial, and he, won’t be ruining the holidays.'

"It was Merseyside’s strongest league campaign in years, a season when Liverpool and Everton served notice that they are on the move again. Though the Barclays Premier League trophy remained tantalisingly out of Liverpool’s reach and Everton faltered when Champions League football appeared in their grasp, the disappointments should not detract from the work the respective managers Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez have overseen. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Leighton Baines and Luis Suarez starring in boots advert . So near: Brendan Rodgers came close to guiding Liverpool to the title but lost out to Manchester City . Leading the way: Everton manager Roberto Martinez has had a good first season at Goodison Park . There have been many outstanding performers in Red and Blue shirts but if you were to make up a combined starting XI, which players would make the cut – and, more significantly, who would be left on the sidelines? See if you agree with Sportsmail’s selection; the formation would be a modern 4-2-3-1 and that has led to a few difficult decisions. But this team has pace, energy, balance and attacking flair and the players included have all had years to remember. GOALKEEPER: Tim Howard – Back to his best under Roberto Martinez and takes the place between the posts ahead of Simon Mignolet after keeping 16 Premier League clean sheets compared to the Liverpool man’s 10. Safe, reliable and vastly experienced and recently won a new contract. Top stopper: Tim Howard helped Everton qualify for the Europa League next season . RIGHT-BACK: Seamus Coleman – Everton’s Player of the Season and a man whom Martinez dubbed the best in his position in the league; the fearless Republic of Ireland international has flourished under Martinez and scored seven goals in all competitions. Coming of age: Seamus Coleman was Everton's player of the season this year . CENTRAL DEFENDER: Martin Skrtel – Defending was the reason Liverpool’s title charge fell down but Skrtel was the pick of Brendan Rodgers’ back four and made 36 Premier League appearances, scoring seven goals. He put through his net on four occasions but he was not a weak link by any means. Hard man: Martin Skrtel has been a rock at the heart of the Liverpool defence . CENTRAL DEFENDER: Sylvain Distin – It was significant that two of Everton’s poorest defensive displays, against Southampton and Manchester City, came when Distin was nursing a hamstring problem. A calming influence and model professional, his abilities often go under-rated. Calming influence: Sylvain Distin was key at the back for Everton last season . LEFT-BACK: Leighton Baines – Nobody would describe this as being a vintage campaign from the England international but, equally, nobody would preclude him from a composite team. Always a threat at set-plays and his left-foot can be like a magic wand. A first class defender, too. Always a threat: Leighton Baines and his dangerous left foot always gave Everton options . HOLDING MIDFIELD: Steven Gerrard – The abiding image of his season should not be his slip against Chelsea; it should be of him inspiring Liverpool, passing with elan and keeping cool under pressure to lead the title charge. 'Absolutely outstanding,' was Rodgers assessment. It is hard to disagree. Captain fantastic: Steven Gerrard helped keep Liverpool in the title race until the final day of the season . HOLDING MIDFIELD: James McCarthy – Many Evertonians wondered what they were getting for £13.75million when he was brought into replace Marouane Fellaini. What he soon showed was that Everton were significantly better with him in the engine room, a combination of class and graft. Star signing: James McCarthy has played a big part in Everton's sucess since signing from Wigan . RIGHT MIDFIELD: Jordan Henderson – Liverpool desperately missed his energy, work rate and technique during the three games he was suspended on the run-in. He said back in July that this season had to be 'my time' and his hard work has paid off with a trip to Brazil looming. Rejuvenated: Jordan Henderson (right) silenced a few doubters after a superb season for Liverpool . ATTACKING MIDFIELD: Ross Barkley – It must be pointed out that the 20-year-old hasn’t been consistently brilliant. But when he shines, when gets the bit between his teeth and torments opponents, he is a joy to watch and capable of moments that get you out of your seat. For that reason, he gets accommodated and Daniel Sturridge drops to the bench. Boy for Brazil: Ross Barkley's performances this season have earned him a place in England's squad . LEFT MIDFIELD: Raheem Sterling – Started the season under a cloud, ended it in Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad. Quick, tough, skilful and blessed with a big game temperament, Sterling’s performances were special. We will hear more and more of him in the coming years, as he shows the hype that accompanied his reputation in Academy football was not without substance. Proving his worth: Raheem Sterling is another young player who has earned his spot in England's squad . CENTRE FORWARD: Luis Suarez – The first name on the team sheet. For the goals and the individual awards, the man who had a nose for trouble has catapulted himself into the bracket of the modern greats. Scored every type of goal in every type of game and it was impossible to accurately assess just how many points extra he was worth to Liverpool. Player of the season: Luis Suarez scored 31 goals for Liverpool this term . SUBSTITUTESSimon Mignolet (GK), Glen Johnson, Romelu Lukaku, Daniel Sturridge, Gareth Barry, Philippe Coutinho, Kevin Mirallas . So there you have it. Six starters from Everton may come as a surprise, given the respective finishing positions of the two clubs, but the key choice boiled down to whether to stick with Daniel Sturridge or opt for Ross Barkley. Missing out: Romelu Lukaku and Daniel Sturridge fail to make the starting XI of our team . The Liverpool striker broke through the 20-goal barrier – and equalled a club Premier League record of scoring in 19 games, like Robbie Fowler did in 1994/95 – Barkley’s ability to produce the unexpected demands his inclusion. That he is going to the World Cup merely strengthens his claims.","Steven Gerrard leads dream team compiled from Liverpool and Everton .

"Intense storms swept through the Southwest on Saturday, snapping trees and shrouding metropolitan Phoenix in cascading showers while also bringing flooding to parts of Nevada. The skies above downtown Phoenix were completely gray in the afternoon as strong winds, thunder and rain hit the region. The outside visibility of buildings was almost entirely obscured by rain and clouds. Vehicles drive through the flood prone area of 39th Avenue between Peoria Avenue and Cactus Road during a storm in Phoenix on Saturday, Sept. 27, 2014 . A woman runs from a parking lot to a store during a storm in Phoenix on Saturday . The storm forced authorities to close a section of Interstate 17 for more than hour due to flooding. Flight departures and landings resumed about 3:30 p.m. after they were halted for an hour at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. But airport spokeswoman Julie Rodriguez said delays are expected into the evening. More than 40 flights scheduled to land in Phoenix were diverted to other airports, she said. 'The wind caused some damage to the roof of Terminal 2 in the baggage claim area and in some of the gate areas. However, all three terminals at Sky Harbor are operational,' Rodriguez said in a statement. Branches and debris littered streets around the city and at least one traffic light was knocked over. Some trees were toppled by the ensuing wind. The Salt River Project utility said that about 31,000 customers were without power as of Saturday afternoon. , Sept. 27, 2014. National Weather Service meteorologist Marvin Percha says the weather is a mix of Phoenix's first fall storm and leftover monsoon moisture . Vehicles drive through the flood prone area of 39th Avenue between Peoria Avenue and Cactus Road during a storm in Phoenix . Most of the outages were in west Phoenix and suburbs west of Phoenix, with smaller clusters reported in Scottsdale, Mesa and Tempe. Utility officials estimated that power would be restored sometime Saturday afternoon. Phoenix Fire Capt. Benjamin Santillan said firefighters were helping to locate a hiker in south Phoenix stranded by a washed away trail. The woman was hiking with her dog when the rain hit. Santillan said she was able to find her way to a road and crews were using her cellphone signal to find her. Crews, meanwhile, have been responding to multiple calls around the city of trees falling on vehicles and small electrical-related fires. National Weather Service meteorologist Valerie Meyers said a record-breaking 1.6 inches of rain has been reported so far. That total surpassed the 1.46 inches reported on this date in 1903. While the storm was starting to clear out in some parts of the city, there would still be lingering showers and isolated thunderstorms into the evening east of Phoenix, Meyers said.

The weather was a mix of Phoenix's first fall storm and leftover monsoon moisture, National Weather Service meteorologist Marvin Percha said. In southeast Nevada's rural Moapa Valley, heavy rains brought flooding but authorities say that despite a river cresting at a record high, the damage wasn't as bad as what was caused by high waters in the area earlier in the month. Clark County Deputy Fire Chief Jon Klassen said the only evacuations occurred in the tiny town of Warm Springs, but he didn't know how many people or homes were affected. Roads to the town were flooded and inaccessible. David Aguilar said an inch of silt came into his Moapa Valley house along the Muddy River. A shopper pushes a cart as he runs to his vehicle during a storm in Phoenix . 'All of a sudden, I heard the sound of water,' he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal, adding a water pipe also broke, complicating cleanup efforts. Other residents say the flood left mud and debris in yards, inundated sheds and other exterior buildings and damaged vehicles. There were also reports of storm problems in Las Vegas, as well as a power outage in Henderson. Las Vegas Fire and Rescue spokesman Tim Szymanski said a townhouse was heavily damaged after being hit by lightning, but no one was hurt. He said firefighters also responded to two calls of minor flooding, one at a residence and another at a business. A taxi drives by a downed tree branch near the Gila River Arena in Glendale, Ariz. Authorities responded to cars stuck on Interstate 15, but no one was trapped and the cars were unoccupied, Klassen said. Interstate 15 just south of Mesquite reopened after flooding closed it in both directions Saturday morning, according to the Nevada Department of Transportation. But southbound travel was reduced to one lane. In northern Arizona, Flagstaff residents also saw showers, thunder and lightning Saturday. More than an inch of rain fell in isolated areas south of Prescott by the afternoon, meteorologist Megan Schwitzer said. The Weather Service also said that nickel-sized hail was reported near Yarnell.","Storm .

"A former daycare owner has been charged with murder after a three-year-old boy accidentally hanged himself on twine while going down a slide. Janna Thompson was indicted for second degree murder and child cruelty following the death of Thomas Maxwell Stephens, in July. The toddler died from asphyxiation after he was left on the playground of Ms Janna's daycare in Alpharetta, Georgia, unsupervised. Charged: Janna Thompson was indicted as a result of the death of Thomas 'Max' Maxwell Stephens, who died on a slide at a daycare centre in Alpharetta, Georgia . He and his classmates were in the playground when police believe his head became tangled in the loop of twine. The tragic incident unfolded three months after the residential home, which Ms Janna had been operating for 25 years, was deemed unsafe. On the day of the boy's death, she was said to have left the him outside as she disciplined another child outside. At the time, Thompson allegedly had seven children in her care, even though she was allowed by state law to care for only six, according to The Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning. 'While the children were playing, one toddler began misbehaving,' a court document seen by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution stated. 'The Provider took this child inside leaving three children unsupervised on the playground. 'While inside, the Provider used the restroom, received a phone call and made a phone call.' Scene: The youngster was playing on the slide when he is said to have become tangled in the twine. He died a day later from asphyxiation . When she returned, she saw the child lying flat on the slide, unconcious, and dialled 911. Police then arrived to find the woman performing CPR on the child . Her state's daycare licence was suspended the week after the death and she was forced to close it down. Thompson had not been charged in connection to the boy’s death until her indictment. But in August, seeking unspecified damages. Earlier this year, investigators said there was an excessive amount of twine, long tree limbs and pine cones which were a danger to children playing on the site. Thompson has reportedly not been taken into custody.

"A Montana teacher was sentenced Friday to 10 years in custody in a student rape case that led to the censure of a judge who partially blamed the victim. Stacey Dean Rambold, 55, was resentenced by Judge Randal Spaulding exactly a year after he completed an initial one-month prison term for the crime. Rambold appeared to grimace as the new sentence was read. He was then handcuffed and led away by deputies, pausing briefly to exchange words with family as he exited the courtroom. Former teacher Stacey Dean Rambold, was sent to jail for a second time for the rape of a 14-year-old student who later committed suicide . Rambold received 10 years in prison after an earlier sentence was overturned and the judge who imposed it censured over his comments about the victim . Former teacher Stacey Dean Rambold is led away in handcuffs after being sentenced to 10 years in state prison . Rambold pleaded guilty to a single count of sexual intercourse without consent in the 2007 incident involving 14-year-old Cherice Moralez, a freshman in his Billings Senior High School business class. She committed suicide in 2010. The state Supreme Court overturned Rambold's initial sentence, citing in part comments from Judge G. Todd Baugh who suggested the victim shared responsibility. Baugh was censured and suspended for 31 days. He's stepping down when his terms ends in January. Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito said he was pleased with the sentence that included five additional years that were suspended. Tragedy: The victim Cherice Moralez killed herself while the case against Rambold was pending . John Moralez holds up pictures of his daughter when she was a child during the sentencing hearing. He said he had hoped for a still longer sentence — but, he added, a decade is better than a month . Montana District Judge Randal Spaulding pronounces a 10-year prison sentence with another five years suspended for former teacher Stacey Dean Rambold convicted of raping one of his students . Tragedy: The victim Cherice Moralez killed herself while the case against Rambold was pending . 'The criminal justice system worked today,' he said. John Moralez, the father of the victim, had hoped for a longer sentence but said it was better than the one-month previously serviced by Rambold. During the hearing, Twito asked Judge Spaulding to reject defense attempts to make the victim's conduct in the case a factor in Rambold's sentencing. That included references by the defendant's attorney to video-taped interviews of the victim recorded by law enforcement prior to her death. Those recordings, which have never been made public, had been cited by Baugh during his sentencing. Under state law, children under 16 cannot consent to sexual intercourse. 'The last thing we want to do is sit here in the criminal justice system and say, 'What is the age?' It doesn't matter. Fourteen is way too young,' Twito said. 'There has to be punishment. ... Punishment means prison.' Rambold's attorney, Jay Lansing, responded that there was no statute preventing the court from considering Moralez's conduct. He pointed out that similar objections were never raised by prosecutors during Rambold's first sentence, and said they were seeking a 'do-over,' which Lansing asserted was not allowed under state and federal law. Outrageous: Rambold has previously said that his 14-year-old victim ChericeMoralez (pictured here) was responsible for his actions because she appeared older than her actual age . District Judge G. Todd Baugh: Baughsentenced Rambold to one-month in jail in 2013. He has since admitted his huge mistake and even triedto re-sentence Rambold in August of that year but failed . In a letter to the court, Rambold sought forgiveness and lamented the international publicity his case has generated. 'No one can really appreciate and understand what it feels like to have so many people actually hate you and be disgusted by you,' Rambold wrote. 'I do not mention this for the sake of sympathy, but it has been hard.' Twito asked the court to impose a 10-year prison sentence with another 10 years suspended. That is the same sentence prosecutors sought last year when the case was before Baugh, who instead adopted the much more lenient term suggested by Rambold's defense attorney. Without Moralez, their primary witness, prosecutors struck a deal with Rambold that initially allowed him to avoid prison altogether. Rambold, however, violated that agreement by having unauthorized visits with relatives' children and entering into a relationship with an adult woman without telling his counselor. As a result, the case was revived and Rambold pleaded guilty last year to the count of sexual intercourse without consent. Spaulding sentenced Rambold  (pictured here)  after a 90-minute hearing that included testimony from the victim's mother and father and Rambold's probation and parole officer . Tthe victim’s age, Rambold’s position as a teacher and his response to being warned by school officials all factored into his sentencing. Rambold didn’t force himself on his victim and has completed sex offender treatment . During the first sentencing, Baugh suggested the victim had as much control over her rape as the defendant and said she 'appeared older than her chronological age.' He gave Rambold a 15-year term with all but one month suspended. That triggered an appeal from prosecutors and ultimately resulted in the case being reassigned to Spaulding. Baugh's comments and the lenient sentence he handed down landed him before the state Supreme Court for disciplinary proceedings, which resulted in a 30-day suspension from the bench and a public censure for his misconduct in the case. In a sentencing memorandum filed this week, Twito wrote that a tough sentence for Rambold was warranted given his position of authority over Moralez. 'His position of trust as a high school teacher, abuse of that position, and violations against the victim overshadows all mitigating circumstances,' Twito wrote.","Stacey Dean Rambold, 55, was sentenced to 30-days in jail in August 2013 for the rape of 14-year-old Cherice Moralez .

"A Pennsylvania woman's discovery of blood near her chicken coop has brought police descending on her small farm in the hunt for trooper killer Eric Frein. Joyce Aleckna said none of her animals appeared to be injured, but that she called police as soon as she saw the blood. Authorities have taken a sample of the blood to test. Scroll down for video . A Pennsylvania woman's discovery of blood near her chicken coop has brought police descending on her small farm in the hunt for trooper killer Eric Frein . Joyce Aleckna said none of her animals appeared to be injured, but that she called police as soon as she saw the blood . Aleckna, a retied corrections officer, told ABC News the blood appeared after the place was left totally empty for the first time since Frein went on the run. Frein, 31, is charged with opening fire outside the Blooming Grove state police barracks on September 12, killing Pennsylvania State Police Corporal Bryon Dickson and seriously injuring Trooper Alex Douglass. Six weeks later, the self-taught survivalist remains at large. 'At night, we lock everything,' Aleckna told reporters. 'Everything is locked tight.' But he family's gun safety training has kept her from being too fearful. 'I don't think he [Frein] stands a chance if he comes in my back yard,' she said. Authorities have taken a sample of the blood to test . Previously, a local law enforcement official reported seeing suspect Eric Frein near the Swiftwater Post Office in the Pocono Mountains, leading to an intensive police search. Frein was not captured, Trooper Connie Devens said Monday night, and police are still searching for him more than a month after he shot dead a trooper and seriously injured another. The post office is near Pocono Mountain East High School, Frein's old school. A woman out for a walk on Friday night spotted a rifle-toting man with a mud-covered face at the school. Wanted: Eric Frein might have been spotted on Monday, just days after he was seen near his old school Friday. Police released these images showing what Frein could look like after weeks of eluding authorities . On Tuesday morning, police swarmed around a clothing bin, which is used to collect clothing donations, in Swiftwater before moving on. The Pocono Mountain School District also decided to cancel classes for Tuesday - even though officials said on Monday they would remain open. State Police Trooper Tom Kelly explained classes were called off 'as a result of the police activity in the area of the school'. Authorities had been searching for him in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis but shifted their primary search area five or six miles to the southwest after Friday night's sighting. Lt. Col. George Bivens said over the weekend that police have put a 'tremendous amount of pressure on him' and likely forced him to move. Search: A Pennsylvania State Trooper patrols along a closed section of Lower Swiftwater Road on Saturday as authorities shifted their search area further southwest after Friday night's sighting . Closing in: FBI agents prepare to patrol the woods on Lower Swiftwater Road on Saturday, October 18 . The high school, Frein's alma mater, and all other schools in the Pocono Mountain School District were open Monday but took extra precautions in light of the Friday sighting. Additional officers from the Pocono Mountain Regional Police Department were stationed at the district's Swiftwater campus to supplement the lone police officer who normally patrols that location, which, besides the high school, includes a junior high and elementary school. Pennsylvania State Police did not recommend that schools close, district spokeswoman Wendy Frable said. 'We would not bring the students in if we did not have reassurance from police they felt the campus was safe,' she said Monday morning. Hours later, as police ramped up their search efforts in the area in response to the latest possible sighting, district officials moved outdoor after-school athletic practices to another campus. Attack: Frein, 31, allegedly shot dead Pennsylvania State Police Corporal Bryon Dickson as he stepped outside his barracks on September 12. He then allegedly shot Trooper Alex Douglass, seriously injuring him . State police have said they believe Frein, a self-taught survivalist, has a hatred of law enforcement and wants to target police, not the general public. State police said Monday that blood found at two homes in the search area is not linked to Frein. DNA testing ruled out any link to Frein in blood droplets found on a covered porch in the area. Material found on a back door at a second home near the first turned out not to be human blood. Police believe Frein could be breaking into vacant cabins or vacation homes to look for food or take shelter. The search has put a stop to Barrett Township's Halloween festivities and is also affecting tourism to the area thanks to road blocks and hunting restrictions. Throughout their search, the survivalist has left police clues. Holding on: Frein, pictured right, hates law enforcement and wants to target police, authorities have said . Most recently, Frein's journal was found ditched at a campsite near his home in Canadensis. In the diary, he wrote a chilling description of his cold-blooded sniper attack on the Pennsylvania State Police barracks. 'Friday, September 12, got a shot around 11pm, he dropped. I was surprised at how quick,' the diary reads. 'I took a follow-up shot on his head and neck area. He was still and quiet after that. 'Another cop approached the one I just shot. As he went to kneel, I took a shot at him, one jumped in the door. His legs were visible and still. I ran back to the Jeep.' The diary makes no mention of Frein knowing either trooper or that he was intending to target any individual. Instead, it sets out Frein's desire to kill law enforcement officers and commit mass murder.","Eric Frein has been hiding out in the woods in the Pocono Mountains for more than a month since 'shooting dead a trooper and injuring another'

"With half-term almost upon us, there is good news for families planning an autumn break. The pound is up against the majority of the major currencies compared to this time last year, which could mean that little bit extra luxury this autumn season. The strength of sterling means holidaymakers jetting off to the sun could get up to 13 per cent more money than October 2013. There is fun for all the family at the four-star Hotel Cala Gran at the Costa del Sur - and this year it will cost less . Cyprus is always a good place to head to at this time of the year for some autumn sun . Travel money expert International Currency Exchange compared rates this October versus October last year and found the biggest difference to be Turkish lira, with families getting more than 195 extra lira on a £500 exchange. The pound against the euro has reached a two-year high in the past few weeks and now offers over 6.5 per cent more euros compared to this time last year, boosting spending power in popular autumn destinations like Portugal, Malta and the Canaries. Consider choosing a destination where your currency is strong versus the local currency. When you are away you'll receive better value on food, drinks and holiday activities. Booking a flight and accommodation together as a package can provide a saving. Book travel insurance before you leave to avoid the pitfalls of large bills and having to replace the contents of your suitcase if the worst was to happen. Book activities such as tours and excursions before you leave, saving time when you reach your destination. When booking late night or early morning travel consider the additional costs that may be incurred such as taxi fares or airport parking. If you are parking at the airport, shop around for the best deals. Book medical insurance before you leave to avoid potentially expensive medical bills if you fall sick or get injured. For those travelling in Europe you can get a European Health Insurance card  which you can apply for online. It's free to apply and it can mean that the cost of medical treatment is significantly reduced or even free. Check if an in-flight meal is included and weigh up the costs of saving a few pounds on your flight vs. the amount you'll actually spend at the airport or in-flight on food. Consider all the extras when booking a hotel. A hotel might seem cheaper at first, but if you consider the cost of Wi-Fi and meals you may find you're not really saving at all – and may even end up paying more! Provided by Expedia . Those planning a holiday to North America for the fall could also be 'quids in'. Sterling has strengthened by more than seven per cent against the Canadian dollar. Parents forking out for theme parks and attractions in the US will find it a little more affordable than last October with rates now comparable to 2012. Koko Sarkari, head of International Currency Exchange, said: 'The pound is providing good value against a range of currencies right now, particularly the euro, offering over 38 more euros on a £500 compared to last October.' David Swann from Travelex added: 'The Pound's value has sunk slightly from its inflated position a few months ago but British holidaymakers will still get more from their holiday budgets compared to this time last year. 'Whether heading on a short getaway, or farther flung destinations there are some considerable savings to be made.' Expedia.co.uk managing director Andy Washington said: 'Families looking to book a holiday this half term can really benefit from the strong pound we are seeing this year. 'At the current exchange rate, for every £10 spent, holidaymakers receive a further 80 pence for their money in Europe, compared to this time last year. 'This puts British holidaymakers in a great position when booking European travel, giving them better value for money on hotel bookings and Euro currency before a trip. 'Visiting destinations where the pound is strong is a great way to save money and make it go further on your holiday.' London Gatwick Airport has released its forecast figures and destinations ahead of one of the busiest breaks in the school calendar. Around one million passengers will fly through Gatwick between Friday, October 24 and Sunday, November 2, with more than 509,000 expected to depart. The data also reveals that Friday, October 24 – the first day of the school break – will be the most popular to fly from the airport, with around 64,000 people expected to travel. Passengers are clearly making the most of the half term, with the busiest arrivals period set to be the day before the schools go back. Sunday, November 2 will see around 60,000 people return via Gatwick. The five-star THB Torrequebrada in Benalmádena comes at a good price for Brits this year . The NH Lord Charles in South Africa offers a luxury Brits might be able to take advantage of this half-term due to the strength of the pound . A seven-night stay in the Pensione Hotel in Perth, Australia, is now cheaper for Brits . More air passengers will fly off to Barcelona this upcoming half-term than anywhere else. The Catalan capital takes the number one crown from last year's most popular October half-term destination, Dublin. Meanwhile, Tenerife in the Canary Islands is 2014's third favourite, followed by the Dutch capital Amsterdam in fourth. Orlando, Florida – home to popular family attractions such as Disneyland and Universal Studios – remains a firm favourite this year in fifth place. Nick Pope, Operations Manager at London Gatwick, said: 'This has been a record year for passenger numbers at Gatwick and this October is no exception. Gatwick is ready to welcome more than one million passengers and we're expecting this October half term to be one of our busiest yet.' Lastminute.com have taken on board the strength of the pound and are hoping holidaymakers will be enticed into a last minute booking. A seven-night stay at the 5* Hotel Venus Beach, Cyprus, departing from London Gatwick on October 26, all inclusive was £1,253 per person at this time last year. Now it comes in at £877pp, a saving of £376pp. And a seven-night stay at the 4* Hotel Cala Gran - Costa del Sur, departing from Gatwick on October 26, all Inclusive was £775 last October, now it is £581pp, a saving of £194. And these cost savings aren't limited to Europe. A seven-night stay at the 4* Pensione Hotel, room only, departing from London Heathrow on October 26, was £1,121pp last October, and is now £995pp, saving £126pp. A Thomas Cook spokesperson said: 'Demand for holidays this half term has been incredibly high, and while there might be a few deals still available for anyone who's left it late to book, these are few and far between. 'Savvy consumers booked their half term breaks early, realising that holidays to popular destinations on the continent aren't as expensive as they might think. 'The Canary Islands, famed for year-round sunshine, their fantastic family offering and exceptional value for money, are proving particularly popular. However, it's not just Europe that offers great value – this half term, we've seen non-Euro Zone favourites such as Egypt and Turkey very much in demand.'","Compared to other currencies, the British Pound is faring well .

"A British terror suspect who is wanted in the United States for allegedly conspiring with hook-handed extremist Abu Hamza has been extradited from the UK. Haroon Rashid Aswat, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, is accused by US authorities of working with Hamza in 1999 to set up a Jihadist training camp in Oregon. Earlier this year, the Home Secretary was told to put extradition plans on hold after judges heard that Aswat, 40, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. Radical cleric Abu Hamza (left) and Haroon Aswat (right). Aswat lived at a Seattle mosque in early 2000 and has now been extradited to the US . But last month two High Court judges said they were satisfied with assurances given by American officials that he would be cared for. Aswat, who was originally arrested at RAF Northolt on August 7 2005 by officers from the Metropolitan Police Service’s Extradition Unit, was taken from Broadmoor hospital to a UK airport this morning and handed over to US authorities. Hamza was extradited from Britain to America nearly two years ago and found guilty of 11 terrorism charges in May after a trial in New York. He is facing life behind bars in the States. The warrants issued on behalf of the US authorities allege that, between October 1 1999 and April 30 2000, Aswat conspired with others to control and manage people who would be employed for ‘the use or display of physical force in promoting a political object, namely to make hijrah to, and to fight jihad in, Afghanistan’. Aswat’s lawyers had argued that he might suffer a relapse if held in an American jail pending any trial. And, at a High Court hearing in April, judges had said they wanted assurances about the way he would be treated. Abu Hamza al-Masri was found guilty of terrorism charges in May after being sent to the US for trial . After a hearing last month, a Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are pleased the court has upheld the Home Secretary’s decision to extradite Haroon Aswat to the United States. ‘The court agreed that the American authorities had provided sufficient assurances over the conditions in which Aswat would be held in the US.’ Hate cleric Abu Hamza's son led kidnap gang who tortured man for three days over £15,000 debt. Tito Ibn Sheikh, 28, was jailed for 12 years after a jury agreed he 'orchestrated the violence' inflicted on restaurant worker Hassan Monawwer over three days. Mr Monawwer was knifed, strangled almost to death and battered with a metal bar and wooden cosh in three separate locations before armed police burst in to save him . Scammers: Hamza Mustafa Kamel, Mohamed Kamel Mostafa and Mohssin Ghailan, the three sons of jailed hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza who exploited a loophole in the vehicle registration system to steal luxury cars . Sheikh, who is one of nine children of Hamza, was convicted last year, but a judge banned reports on his family ties to avoid prejudicing jurors. But last week after he and an accomplice unsuccessfully appealed their convictions the court lifted the gag allowing him to be named the the circumstances of the case revealed. Sheikh and friends Adam Abed and Mostafa Dawoud snatched Mr Monawwer in Acton, west London, in 2012. They subjected him to an ordeal of violence over £15,000 he was said to owe to Abed, the Sun on Sunday reports. Yet in an effort to extort even more money, the trio told his family they would sell him to another gang unless they came up with £25,000 ransom. Prosecutors said: 'His neck was squeezed so hard he thought his tongue would pop out.' Hamza, 58, has nine children – six sons, two daughters and a stepson. Five of his sons are now known to have criminal records. Mohammed Kamel Mostafa, Hamza's eldest son, was jailed for plotting to blow up British tourists. He was accused of masterminding a plot to sabotage economic and tourist sites in Yemen in August 1999, when he was just 17. He returned to London in January 2002 after serving three years in prison in the Arab state. Six years later he was jailed again, along with his brother Hamza Mustafa Kamel and their step-brother Mohssin Ghailam. The trio operated a £1million luxury car scam which involved exploiting a DVLA loophole to steal BMW, Mercedes and other luxury brand cars, which they then either sold on or used as collateral to make fraudulent loans. Although they were investigated by anti-terror police there was no evidence they used the cash for terrorist purposes. 'They just used the cash to party,' a source said at the time. In 2012, another of Hamza's sons, Imran Mostafa, was jailed after being convicted of armed robbery and illegal possession of a firearm over a smash and grab raid on a jewellers in King's Lynn, Norfolk. Hamza himself faces life in jail in the U.S. after he was convicted of 11 terrorism charges. Meanwhile, his second wife Najat Mostafa, 55, mother of seven of his children, lives in a £1.25million five-bedroom council house in Shepherd’s Bush, West London.","Haroon Rashid Aswat, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, worked with Hamza .

"A 43-year-old  mother of two has been stabbed to death in front of her children during a row over a parking space in California, police have said. Elizabeth Yanez was allegedly attacked by Reggie Cervantes, 22, and Brenda Rangel, 19, after they started arguing about parking at the Santa Fe Springs Swap Meet in Los Angeles last Friday. The pair reportedly stabbed her in her neck and back in front of her children, aged 22 and 23, before leaving her bleeding on the ground. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Elizabeth Yanez, 43, was stabbed to death in front of her children during a row over a parking space . Emergency services were called to the scene in Whittier and Ms Yanez was taken to UCI Medical Center with severe stab wounds. Despite doctors' best efforts, she later died. Now, Cervantes and Rangel, both from South Los Angeles, have been arrested by police and charged with murder, according to a police release obtained by NBC Los Angeles. Ms Yanez's son, Daniel Crable, who witnessed the stabbing, said his mother had been attacked at the popular Swap Meet at 13000 block of Alondra Boulevard  'because of a parking space'.

"David Cameron could face a vote of no confidence from furious Tory MPs if he fails to defeat UKIP in the Rochester by-election, it emerged today. Cabinet ministers believe the Prime Minister will face a challenge to his leadership if Tory defector Mark Reckless wins the seat for UKIP. Mr Cameron has urged Tory activists to join the fight to kick Mr Reckless' 'fat arse' off the Commons benches, but one opinion poll put UKIP nine points ahead in the by-election, expected in late November. David Cameron has been warned he would face a vote of no confidence in his leadership if the Tories lose the second by-election triggered by Tory defections to UKIP . Mark Reckless, pictured with UKIP leader Nigel Farage, triggered the by-election in Rochester and Strood after defecting from the Conservatives . The Prime Minister is personally furious at Mr Reckless's decision to leave the Tory party, announcing it on the eve of the Tory conference to cause maximum damage. While Mr Cameron was resigned to the fact that Douglas Carswell, a long-standing Eurosceptic MP, would win the by-election in Clacton, he is furious at Mr Reckless' 'betrayal'. But the PM has vowed to personally lead the fight in Rochester, and will make his first visit to the seat this week. But he faces warnings that if the Tories lose the seat, his leadership will be called into question. One Cabinet Minister warns that that 'if Reckless wins Rochester, there'll be 46 names' of Tory MPs forcing a leadership contest, the Mail On Sunday reported.. It would mean Mr Cameron would face a vote of no confidence by his MPs. 'Cameron would win. But it would be very damaging,' the minister added. The Tory party is expected to mount a huge effort to hold the seat, but Mr Carswell predicts UKIP will score a second stunning victory. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: 'I was down there supporting our excellent candidate Mark Reckless who chose to do the honourable thing and ask voters for their permission. 'It actually felt a little bit like Clacton - I had lots of people saying to me they don't normally vote, or they normally vote Conservative or Labour, but they look at this guy Reckless… and I think things are going okay there. 'The fact is that Rochester is the 271st most UKIP-y seat in the country, and if we can win there, it looks like we're nine points ahead – it's a tough fight and I think we can do it then it means things are going to look significantly different.' He added: 'Let's keep a sense of perspective. We have won a single seat. There are 300-and-something to go to get a majority.' Douglas Carswell, who last week become UKIP's first elected MP after defecting from the Tories, today predicted his new party would win in Rochester . At an event at the Tory conference, Mr Cameron is said to have claimed that if Mr Reckless 'got off his fat arse and worked harder he wouldn't have to defect to UKIP to save his skin'. The Tory leader argues that committed volunteers have 'knocked on doors, stuffed envelopes, licked stamps to get his fat arse on the Commons benches, and this is how he repays them'. Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate a new deal with the EU, clawing back powers from Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum in 2017. Under pressure from Eurosceptics, Mr Cameron has made clear he will not argue for Britain to remain in the EU if it is not in the national interest. Mr Carswell comfortably won the Clacton by-election on Thursday with a 12,404 majority - a result which the Tories admitted left Ed Miliband in pole position to be the next Prime Minister. Within hours of the result emerging, Mr Camern said: 'What last night demonstrates is that if you see a big Ukip vote, you will end up with Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, Ed Balls as Chancellor and Labour in power.' Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps added: 'Let me be blunt. What we have seen is a simple truth. This just puts Miliband closer to victory. This has just made his job of getting into Number 10 easier.' Ukip have risen dramatically in the polls since April 2012 when they languished on 9% with little hope of an MP . A new nationwide poll shows support for UKIP has soared to an all-time high 25 per cent – in theory enough for the party to take 128 seats in the Commons. The Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday had Labour and the Tories tied on 31 per cent, and the Lib Dems languishing on 8 per cent. According to John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, the poll would give Labour 253 MPs, Conservatives 187, UKIP 128, Lib Dems 11, and others, including Scots Nats and Ulster MPs, 71. Prof Curtice said: 'If UKIP are to turn votes into Commons seats in Britain's first-past-the-post system, they need to build up bastions of local strength. Today's poll suggests they may have begun to do that. 'The 25 per cent level represents a 22-point increase on the three per cent the party won in 2010. If that increase were to occur evenly in every constituency, they could still fail to pick up a single seat. 'But today's poll suggests UKIP's support has increased much more in the South of England outside London than it has elsewhere in the UK – by a staggering 34 points. 'If that level was recorded throughout the South, UKIP could win as many as 128 seats, with no less than 102 of them coming from the Conservatives, whose vote in the region is down 14 points. 'In that event, Cameron would be left with just 187 seats, almost as weak a position as the Conservatives were in after their calamitous defeat in 1997.","46 names of Tory MPs needed to trigger challenge to PM's leadership .

"Coming soon to a plane near you – the mobile phone call. For years, aircraft in flight have – with the exception of Tube carriages and funerals – been a final refuge from the invasive reach of the cellphone conversation. But this state of affairs could be set to change. Last week, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) published new guidance for airlines which lifted restrictions on the use of mobile devices during flight. Scroll down for video . Oh great, it's the boss: Being able to access your mobile on planes means the office can always contact you . And with discussions about a similar relaxation of the rules taking place in the US, the era of having to switch off your phone before take-off – or risk the infinite wrath of that oddly furious air stewardess – could be coming to an end. Will this be a good and wonderful thing – another breezy victory for technology as the age of information marches unstoppably onwards? Or just an extra irritating factor bolted on to the already-really-quite-irritating experience that is air travel in the 21st century? We can think of a few reasons why it may be the former. And lots of reasons why it may be the latter. Ten reasons why mobile phones on planes will be A Bad Thing . (1) The ‘I’m on a plane’ conversation . At a rough estimate (ie, I’ve just made this figure up), nine out of ten conversations made on mobile phones are completely unnecessary. Useful things and Words Of Great Import are rarely spoken on cellphones. They are the white noise of modern life. Bursts of static. So bear in mind that almost every phone call conducted on a plane will go something like the below. Then bear in mind how annoying this will be if you are sitting in the next seat. Ring ring. Person calling: Hi Dave/Steve/Sarah/Kim, how are you? Dave/Steve/Sarah/Kim: I’m good. I’m on a plane right now. Person calling: Oh, OK. Some other question that could definitely wait for a better time. Dave/Steve/Sarah/Kim: Not now, no. I’m on a plane. Repeat three million times on your flight alone. Crackle crackle: You may be able to talk on your phone soon - but will you be able to hear the other person? (2) The quality of the line . Despite great advances in communications technology, there are frequently occasions when you can be walking in the middle of London, Paris or New York, and still receive a call where all you can hear down the line is what sounds like a double-decker bus reversing over glass, 200 seagulls having a fight over a biscuit, or a cat let loose on yesterday’s newspaper. Will the quality of the line be any better when you are not standing at the heart of a major metropolis, but 36,000ft above Alaska, in a reinforced metal tube? We’re guessing ‘no’. (3) No rest for the wicked . If there is one thing that the lengthy international flight has in its favour in the 21st century, it is the fact that, for eight or so hours, you are gloriously unobtainable. And with the rest of the world on pause, you can sink back into your seat (or sit bolt upright in it, if you are flying in economy), drink a glass of cheap teeth-staining red wine, and watch whatever ‘comedy’ Vince Vaughn has put his name to this month. Yeah, Owen Wilson is in it too. But what’s this? If mobile phones are allowed on board, your e-mails will be permitted too. And suddenly, your boss wants you to download that attachment about maximising performance figures, blah blah, something about revenue, blah blah, Office Hawaiian Shirt Day on Friday. Goodbye Vince and Owen. Hello that endless pile of paperwork. 'Hello, I'm on the plane': Will the use of phones on aircraft merely make other passengers even more irritating? (4) Ringtones in the night . There are many things which can be classified as ‘all but impossible’: Running the 100 Metres in less than five seconds. Climbing Everest with no arms. Watching 10 minutes of The X Factor without some weeping tone-deaf idiot from Crewe declaring that ‘this is all I want to do, and I’ll give it one million per cent.’ The very idea of ‘one million per cent’. You can add to this list: ‘Getting any sort of viable sleep in an economy class seat’. But just imagine, for one brief, glorious second, that you have dropped off on your way back across the Atlantic. You are having a nice dream about chocolate, or kittens, or Jennifer Lawrence. And then someone’s phone starts ringing in a bag in the overhead locker above you. And that no-one gets up to answer it. Not even when it rings for the fifth time. Now it is not nice to want to throw someone from a moving plane. But in certain situations… . (5) The queue for the loo just got longer . So you want to have a private phone conversation, even though you are in the middle of a plane cabin, where just the 200 random acquaintances can hear your every word. Where can you go to say ‘goodnight squeegee-weegy snuggleboo, I wuv you too’ to your nearest and dearest without an entire aircraft guffawing? Why has the toilet been in use all flight? (6) The guy in front’s voice . In the event that someone does decide to have a full phone conversation while in listening range of 200 strangers, you can guarantee that their voice will not be one that sings blissful melodies on chill-out albums, or features on adverts for spa weekends or luxury toilet paper. It will be the nasal equivalent of a small hand drill being used on a blackboard, or 30,000 mosquitos having a ‘who has the highest whine’ competition inside your ear. Oh great, the guy in Seat 44B is going to play games for the next eight hours. Isn't technology wonderful? (7) A billion bad photos . The advent of the smartphone has freed us all from the evil clutches of old-fashioned cameras and the tyranny of proper photography, and liberated us to take images of whatever we want, whenever we want. Particularly if it’s a red-eyed selfie, a rubbish snap of a plate of dinner, or a blurry picture of a cat hilariously being asleep, or something. Just imagine the wealth of visual brilliance that will flood social media when we are all allowed to take photos from two miles above the earth’s surface, and post them online IMMEDIATELY? Is it Greenland? Is that the Atlantic Ocean, or is it the back of the seat in front? Did you have your finger over the lens on that one? #absolutelynobodycares . (8) It won’t be cheap . For mobile phones to work properly in transit, airlines will have to install extra technology on their planes. Will they do this out of the goodness of their profit margins – or will the additional cost be added discreetly to your next ticket? Don’t answer that. And just wait until your service provider – never shy of foisting an extra lump sum onto your bill because you downloaded one photo while in France – works out that you’ve been chatting in the air. Hello Mr Bank Manager, I’d like to discuss a second mortgage. (9) Random requests . You know how blood-boilingly annoyed you get when somebody in the office goes around asking if ‘anyone has a charger for an iPhone 6’, because he’s already lost his, despite the phone only being released 10 minutes ago. And then doesn’t return yours. That. At 36,000ft. Disaster averted: For years, we've been told that this is what will happen if we use our mobiles while in the air . (10) It means the airlines have been lying to us all this time . For the last decade or so, the rhetoric has been simple – we have to put away our phones during flights because they may interfere with the plane’s communication systems. With this has come the unspoken threat – ‘switch off your phone immediately or this aircraft will – instantly and irreversibly – spiral downwards into the ground, killing all of us on board. And you, and you alone, Man On Phone in Seat 9B, will be responsible for this.’ Turns out this wasn’t the case. Who knew? Three reasons why mobile phones on planes will be A Good Thing . Noah: A good reason to make a phone call to anyone . (1) Proper arrival times . No more will your long-suffering partner have to hang around an airport on the basis that you might arrive at some point in the next four hours. A simple ‘darling, we’re in an eternal queue above JFK, get another coffee’ will at least reveal where the hell you are. (2) No more nasty surprises . Few things are more worrying than the clang-clang of five ‘missed call’ text messages when you return to terra firma. What’s happened? Have I been fired? Are you divorcing me? Is the dog dead? Now, at least you will know of Mr Chuckle's tragic departure to the kennel in the sky in good time. (3) They will save us all from the thorny issue of bad movies . Last month, I watched almost half an hour – about 27 minutes, I think – of Noah, starring Russell Crowe, on a transatlantic flight. Had I been able to use my phone, I would have been spared this horror.","New rules mean phones could soon be used on flights in European airspace .

"Britain's most polluting and least fuel-efficient 'gas-guzzling' cars are driven by motorists in London, a new report reveals today. By contrast Peterborough is the nation's 'green' car capital. Data from the Government's DVLA data that vehicles in London kick out 176.95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre on average – equivalent to around 40mpg. Britain's least fuel-efficient cars are driven by motorists in London, a new report has revealed . That is 25 per cent more than in Peterborough which has Britain's least polluting cars doing 50 mpg and emitting 142.03g/km. The top 10 dirtiest towns and cities also include St Albans and Brighton where pollution levels have breached EU safety limits along with congestion hotspots Cambridge and Chelmsford. Lisburn, Hereford, Newry, Oxford and Norwich are also among those places named and shamed for high greenhouse exhaust gases. Along with Peterborough, the cleanest cars are found in Portsmouth, Stirling, Worcester and Glasgow, as well as Birmingham, Durham, Sunderland, Exeter and Gloucester. London vehicles were the worst offenders, with those in St Albans and Cambridge also in the top five . A queue of traffic in Brighton, which is the third worst city in Britain for polluting vehicles . The figures were compiled by car insurance price comparison website Confused.com based on the postcodes for registered owners of 34,697,151 vehicles. Vehicle emissions in the worst ten cities are far in excess of the 128.3g/km average for new cars sold last year, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. In London, they are not far short of the 2000 figure of 181g/km, which is 41 per cent higher than the 2013 new car average. 1. London: 176.95 . 2. St Albans: 165.52 . 3. Brighton: 165.34 . 4.

Confused.com also commissioned a OnePoll survey of 2,000 adults that found more than a third – 36 per cent - have no idea what their vehicle emits in CO2. More than half (52 per cent) consider it important to reduce emissions and 29 per cent own a low emission car along with nine per cent who consider theirs to be 'eco-friendly.' But a third (33 per cent) cannot afford to buy a low emission car and nearly four out of ten (37 per cent) say the Government should do more to make them affordable in addition to a grant of £5,000 for electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Birmingham is in the top 10 for cities with the greenest vehicles . More than half (52 per cent) say councils should do more to promote alternative travel including buses, trains, cycling and walking. The survey found that most people are dependent on their car to get work, with 62 per cent using it to commute compared to just 19 per cent who take public transport and eight per cent who walk. Confused.com today also publishes a report entitled Carless Cities which examined the possibility of banning cars from city centres within 20 years to cut pollution. It said Department of Health figures estimate that 28,416 deaths in Great Britain in 2010 were attributable to particulate air pollution – largely from diesel vehicle exhaust emissions – including 3,389 in London alone. 'That ranks pollution as a far bigger killer than traffic accidents,' it said. 'To put it into context, Department for Transport figures state that there were 1,713 road deaths in all of Great Britain in 2013. 'It is estimated that, depending on the area, between 6 per cent and 9 per cent of deaths in London are caused by airborne man-made particles.' The report suggests that people are 'falling out of love with the car' in London and other big cities where there are better public transport services. 'The best way to reduce traffic congestion is to make public transport and green transport so much more attractive that people tend to think of it naturally, rather than cars,' said report contributor David Crawford, of traffic management magazine ITS International.","London vehicles kick out 176.95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre .

"A plan for 200 solar panels on an island associated with crime writer Agatha Christie have been blasted as 'horrific' by a former owner. Tony Porter said the panels would 'spoil' Burgh Island off the south Devon coast. The current owners of the island and its hotel say the site, measuring 335 square metres, on a former tennis court, will be protected from view by hedges. The pretty Burgh Island off the South Devon Coast could be set to go solar, which some say will 'spoil' it . Literary inspiration: Crime writer Agatha Christie wrote her novel Evil Under the Sun on Burgh Island . Hotel owners: Tony Orchard and Deborah Clark, plan to install 200 solar panels on an old tennis court . Deborah Clark and Tony Orchard, who own the Art Deco hotel where Christie stayed when she wrote, have applied to South Hams Council in Devon for permission. But former owner Tony Porter - who sold the island in 2001 - said: 'We are horrified that this application has been lodged. We spent 16 years doing everything we could to restore it to its former beauty. 'Now this green island sleeping in the sun is going to be scarred by this horrible shiny thing. It will be visible from miles away. It is going to glint in the sun and spoil the whole thing.' The island inspired the setting for Christie's Evil Under the Sun - one of her Hercule Poirot mysteries.

Well hidden: The owners of the Art Deco hotel believe the solar panels would be concealed by hedges . The Art Deco Hotel:  Its owners have applied for controversially  permission to install solar panels nearby . So far there have been four objections to the plan, including one from a neighbour who overlooks the island. Hubert Ashton said: 'This would be a monstrous carbuncle on an old friend. It would be ruinous for the beauty of the island.' Stuart Watts, of Bigbury Parish Council, said: 'As a feature the island is known around the world so this is bound to prove controversial and stir up a huge amount of interest.' A spokesman for South Hams Council in Devon told Mail Online: 'I don't think this type of planning application has been put forward for the island before, but every application is looked at individually on its merits. 'The application will be looked at very carefully, It's a unique situation in so far as Burgh is a private island and yet planning is a public process.' All of the letters of objection, which can be viewed on South Hams Council website along with the proposal, will be considered. Mr C Ashton wrote: 'This cannot be in the interests of protecting and maintaining an area of outstanding natural beauty which attracts people from far and wide. 'Putting solar panels where you suggest will be visible from all around on the mainland and clearly will ruin any walks that people might want to take on the island thus presumably having a negative impact on visitor numbers.' Meanwhile Mrs Katie MacEachran added: 'I feel this will be a hideous eyesore and not in keeping with the surroundings at all.'","Agatha Christie wrote her novel Evil Under The Sun on the island in Devon .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is pushing ahead with the signing of Porto’s £20million midfielder, Fernando, as he devises a strategy to win the Champions League next season with just 21 players. Pellegrini plans to base his next European campaign around the Brazilian — one of the best holding midfielders in the world — after accepting that the team need to tighten up following three successive Champions League failures. City are determined that Friday’s punishment by UEFA for breaking Financial Fair Play rules, consisting of a heavy fine and squad restrictions, will not alter their ambitions for next season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Man City target Mangala scoring for Porto . Top target: Manchester City are chasing Porto enforcer Fernando for a fee of £20m . Policy: The sanctions will not change which players Manuel Pellegrini decides to chase . Strong: Fernando's team-mate Eliaquim Mangala is another player on Manchester City's radar . But UEFA want City to include the full quota of eight home-grown players in their squad of 21 — cut from 25 — and a UEFA spokesman confirmed: ‘All clubs will have to abide by the regulations.’ UEFA’s stance will force City into difficult decisions over who to leave out, although a senior club source said: ‘There will be no change in transfer strategy.’ That means Fernando, Porto team-mate Eliaquim Mangala and Arsenal’s Bacary Sagna are still expected to sign this summer. Javi Garcia and Matija Nastasic may be sold to raise funds, while a number of English players, including World Cup-bound James Milner, are considering their futures because of a lack of first-team opportunities. Milner’s contract talks have stalled as he enters the final year of his current deal. Fernando, 26, is regarded as a particularly important acquisition by Pellegrini, who privately acknowledged after the club’s Champions League exit to Barcelona last season that he might have to be more  cautious in big games to succeed against Europe’s elite. Pellegrini’s plan is to use Fernando as a defensive midfield player, allowing Fernandinho and Yaya Toure to play ahead of him. That would mean City playing with just one striker in a 4-1-4-1 system for some European games, leaving Alvaro Negredo in danger of missing out altogether on City’s reduced Champions League squad. Despite a £1billion investment in City since 2008, the club’s Abu Dhabi owners have yet to see them reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League, despite twice winning the  Premier League. UEFA’s sanctions pose difficult problems as City plan for next season. In addition to the £49m fine — £33m of which is suspended —  and European squad restrictions, City must not increase their wage bill and cannot spend more than £49m net in this transfer window. Whatever questions are thrown at City, however, Pellegrini believes Fernando is the answer because of his willingness to help protect the defence at all times. Leaving: Javi Garcia is another who may make way with city's reduced budget . Options: James Milner may leave in search of more first-team football . The 6ft 1in player has twice before been . close to coming to the Premier League. Everton boss Roberto Martinez . applied for and received a work permit for him on deadline day last . summer only for the move to break down when Porto failed to sign a . replacement. City then tried to sign Fernando in January in a double . deal with Mangala but failed to agree a fee with their Portuguese club. Fernando’s new contract has a £20m buy-out clause. However, his impending arrival will have a knock-on effect with City’s English players growing increasingly disenchanted about their lack of game time. City need eight home-grown players if they name the full allocation of 25 allowed for their Premier League squad. Wanted: Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna is wanted by a number of clubs, including City . Gone: Joleon Lescott will definitely leave after his contract expired . They have already lost Joleon Lescott, whose contract has run out, and Milner is in no hurry to negotiate his new deal. The 28-year-old was disappointed to be left out of their team for the Capital One Cup final and the final Premier League game of the season against West Ham, when they clinched the title. City would love Milner to stay because of his versatility — a stance that will surely only harden following UEFA’s ruling — and the lack of top English players good enough for their squad. If Milner refuses to renew his deal, they could either sell him this summer or hold him to the final year to make up their home-grown quota but lose him for nothing in 12 months’ time. Sidelined: Micah Richards is interesting Liverpool and has just 12 months left on his current deal . Desperate: Jack Rodwell (right) might also leave as he barely played last season despite being fit . Defender Micah Richards, who interests Liverpool, is in a similar position. Richards has 12 months left on his contract but will not sign a new one having spent most of last season on the sidelines. Midfielder Jack Rodwell, 23, is also desperate for games. He was hardly used by Pellegrini despite being fit for virtually the entire campaign and missed any chance of being in Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad as a result. Milner, Richards and Rodwell had only 15 Premier League starts between them last season — 12 of those by Milner. Spanish midfielder Garcia will be allowed to leave as City are not  permitted more than 17 overseas  players aged over 21 in their Premier League squad.","Manuel Pellegrini pushing ahead with top targets despite FFP sanctions .

At the time she was said to have a 'potentially serious head injury', but was later released. A witness to the fall, who did not wish to be named, said in August: 'I saw the baby fall from the window, but at first I thought it was a doll, it hit an elderly man on the shoulder then fell to the floor. 'I went to see if the man was okay and the baby wasn't making any sound so I still thought it was a doll, but then she started screaming. 'I picked her up and cradled her. There was a big bump on her forehead that was getting bigger and bigger. 'She was bleeding from her nose and mouth.'

'I turned the corner and saw an elderly man coming out the shop with his paper and some milk and then I just saw a white blur coming down.' She added: 'She was just spinning. 'She just looked limp and she wasn’t making any noise. 'I went over and what I thought was this doll just started screaming and I realised it was a baby. 'I was holding her so that her head was in my shoulder and I could see that she was bleeding. 'I put her in a cradle position. She grabbed some tissue and started wiping her face.

"They were comrades in arms who died on the battlefields of Syria, fighting for the Islamic State - but just years earlier they were well mannered boys at one of London's top schools. Mohammed el-Araj, 23, became only the second British fighter to be killed during an ambush on Assad forces last year. And during the first day of Ramadan, his former school mate, Mohammed Nasser, 21, died after shrapnel hit him in the head. Mohammed el-Araj, left, who became only the second British fighter to be killed during an ambush on Assad forces last year, attended London's Holland Park School . The pair attended Holland Park School, where they held open doors for teachers and handed out books in class. The school is so well thought of, David Cameron is considering sending his eldest child Nancy there. Hamzah Parvez, who is still believed to to be fighting President's Assad's forces, also attended the school, as did three others linked to ISIS. Today their former teacher at the school known as the 'Eton of comprehensives', remembered the duo were mannered and full of potential. The ex-teacher who declined to be named, told the Sunday Express: 'I remember these grown-up men as gorgeous, funny, warm, gentle boys. 'Mohamed el-Araj was a naughty little bugger but in the right hands he could have been amazing; he was a bright spark. Mohammed Nasser, left, and Hamzah Parvez, right, were described as a 'double act' and were well mannered . 'He should be running a business or doing stand-up, not standing in a Godforsaken desert being cannon fodder.' Last year Araj, left his family's flat in Blenheim Cescent, in Ladbroke Grove, and headed for Syria where he took the name Abu Khalid. Pictures of him on the internet showed him in a paramilitary uniform, holding an AK-47. Not long afterwards he was dead. His teacher of five years said Araj was a 'little firecracker'. He was bright, she said, but often in trouble and would have fights with other boys. She said: 'He was properly naughty, properly disruptive and would shout and swear. 'He had a problem with being told what to do but probably half the boys I taught at Holland Park were just like him.' Although Holland Park, in the heart of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, about 60 per cent of its pupils come from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds and speak English as a second language. Holland Park School in Chelsea, where the trio went to school; 60 per cent of its pupils come from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds and speak English as a second language . The teacher said Araj was a 'boundary breaker' and she wasn't surprised he wanted to become a jihadi. She said: 'I would not have been surprised if I had found out that he had got into a gang or into crime because like so many of his peers he was searching for meaning and a community and the school was not able to give it to them.' She described Nasser and Parvez as 'softer and sweeter boys'. The boys were two years below Araj, who left the school in 2006, and also lived in Ladbroke Grove. On May 15 this year, the 21-year-old friends vanished. Three months later Parvez featured in an ISIS video where he made a call to arms. He asks the camera: 'What are we doing sitting in the UK? 'Sitting in the land which kills Muslims every day? 'It's not the land for us. 'Are we content with eating Nando's every week? Come to the land of Allah.' He then reveals his friend, Nasser, had been killed in battle. The boy's teacher said he had the 'most beautiful little smile' and was 'so keen to please and do well'. She said the boys were inseparable, a 'real double act'. Smoke and flames fill the air after U.S-led airstrikes in Kobane, Syria, which has been under siege by ISIS . The teacher was at a loss to make sense of why the school was a breeding ground for extremists. She said: 'That just goes to show the power of the radicalising message that even the loveliest ones can make terrible mistakes.' The deaths, the teacher said, were 'horrific' and 'heartbreaking'. Another British Muslim to join the 'holy war' was Mohammed Hassan. The 19-year-old's parents had thought he was beginning his first term at Surrey University to study international politics, when they received a letter from him saying he was now in Syria. As the news sunk in his mother said, 'the whole room was spinning'. Hassan had said he was going to help victims of the civil war, but in reality, he and five friends from Portsmouth, had joined ISIS. According to online reports, he is now near Kobane, which ISIS are being bombed by American airstrikes. Hassan's mother, who did not wish to be named, described her son as popular, and blessed with good looks. She said the turning point in her son's life, came after he took a 'gap-year' and started hanging out with an older crowd, among them, con man, Mashudur Choudhury, 31. During this time he become increasingly militant. On October 8 he travelled to Syria, via Turkey, along with Choudhury and three others. Choulhury returned to the UK a month later and was convicted of terrorist training and two others were shot dead. Hassan's father, Zahid, said his family were 'heartbroken' their son had been 'brainwashed' and prey for his safe return.","Two former students of Holland Park School died fighting for ISIS .

"A man and a woman are facing life behind bars after being found guilty of murdering a man they kicked, punched, stripped then left for dead in a skip after a drunken night out. Mick Hunt, 37, was attacked in the early hours of March 15 by Fiona Nalty and Arry Green in South Norwood, south London. After a trial at the Old Bailey they were found guilty of murder and will be sentenced tomorrow. The trial heard Nalty, 24, started beating up Mr Hunt after he tried to chat her up and Green, 22, joined in because she was a girl, even though the victim remained passive throughout the vicious onslaught. Arry Green (pictured left) and Fiona Nalty (right) beat Mr Hunt to within an inch of his life, then left him for dead . Later that morning, a member of the public found Mr Hunt in an alleyway, severely injured, naked, unconscious and barely breathing. He died in hospital the same day. Prosecutor David Jeremy QC said Mr Hunt had been drinking at the Port Manor pub where he was seen to be to be dancing and enjoying himself. But the evening turned sour when he met the defendants at a nearby off-licence where one witness thought the victim had tried to 'chat up' Nalty, a possible trigger for the violence, Mr Jeremy said. Later, the victim tried to calm the defendants down when they became aggressive at a minicab office after a driver refused to take Nalty home because she was drunk. Nalty began punching and pushing Mr Hunt around outside and Green weighed in with a punch because he did not like the idea of the victim fighting a girl, even though he was not retaliating, the court heard. Green then suggested to Nalty that they should go into a nearby alleyway to 'sort this out', the court heard. Mick Hunt (pictured) was stripped naked and left for dead in a skip after the savage assault . The attack was witnessed by a 15-year-old boy who saw Nalty and Green kicking Mr Hunt as he lay on the floor trying to protect himself and begging 'stop, please stop'. The boy heard Nalty laughing as he turned away because he could not bear to watch, Mr Jeremy told jurors. And when Nalty and Green emerged from the alleyway, the witness heard Nalty say 'we f***** him up bad' before they told him not to tell anyone about what happened, jurors were told. Nalty (pictured) and Green denied all knowledge of the incident when first interviewed by police . The victim was found at 7am that day, the prosecutor said: 'Mr Hunt was lying in the skip on top of builders' rubbish. He was completely naked save for a bandana around his neck. These defendants must have removed his clothing as an act of humiliation. 'Mr Hunt was still breathing in a laboured fashion but was unresponsive and cold to the touch. Police noticed the large number of abrasions and cuts to his body. His face was very swollen and his eyes were closed.' Police wrapped him in a blanket to keep him warm before the ambulance arrived, but Mr Hunt died later that morning at King's College Hospital. A post-mortem examination showed he suffered injuries consistent with kicking and stamping. He suffered a skull fracture as well as a broken nose, cheekbone and rib. After Nalty and Green were arrested, they made no comment in police interviews, but Mr Jeremy said their defence was to pass blame onto each other for Mr Hunt's death. Mr Jeremy said: 'It is clear from the evidence that...both Arry Green and Fiona Nalty were both drunk and behaving very aggressively that night.' But being drunk was no defence, he said: 'They had the wit to take Mr Hunt down that alleyway out of the sight of passers-by and CCTV cameras. The assault was not random - their kicks targeted Mr Hunt's face and head. 'They had the physical co-ordination to attack him so viciously, to strip him naked, and to place his naked body into a skip. 'On emerging they had the presence of mind by telling (the witness) that he should not tell anyone what he had seen.' The victim, who was originally from Co Waterford, in Ireland, but lived with his mother in Selhurst in south London, had suffered from depression and anxiety and been a heroin user in the past. The two were found guilty in a trial at the Old Bailey (pictured) and will be sentenced tomorrow . But Mr Jeremy said that despite being 'a drinker', he was known as 'a friendly man who was not aggressive or violent'. Green, of South Norwood, and Nalty, of Coulsdon, Surrey, denied murder but a jury took less than a day to convict them both. After the verdict, Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway said: 'Michael was described by his friends and family as a friendly man and did nothing to provoke the savage attack that would ultimately cause his death. 'Both Nalty and Green did their best to thwart our investigation, denying all knowledge when first interviewed. 'They have been found to have acted in a very calculated fashion, taking Michael down an alleyway out of the sight of passers-by and CCTV cameras before aiming vicious blows to his head. 'Although drunk, both coldly and deliberately acted to hide Michael's body after the deadly attack.' Mr Hunt's family said in a statement: 'We love and miss you lots and lots, you will never be forgotten. 'Mick was such a kind, gentle-natured spirit, always happy-go-lucky with a dry sense of humour. He had a kind heart and was a loving big blue-eyed sliver fox. 'Mick was very family-orientated. He was loved by everyone who he came into contact with.'","Couple found guilty of murder for attacking man and leaving him for dead .

"Andrew Flintoff is poised to make a shock return to cricket after Lancashire announced they are in talks to bring back the former England all-rounder for their NatWest T20 Blast campaign. Flintoff has not played competitively in nearly five years and bowed out of the game in a blaze of glory by helping England regain the Ashes in 2009, with his retirement, due to a succession of injuries, officially confirmed the following year. But - as revealed by Sportsmail's Paul Newman earlier this month - his old county want the 36-year-old to return.

Iconic: The burly all-rounder dominated English cricket during the early part of the 21st century . Blaze of glory: Flintoff retired from cricket after England's Ashes series victory in 2009 . Flintoff has been training with the first-team squad and working with academy players this season, while earlier this month, the Red Rose tellingly refused to rule out the prospect of Flintoff ending his retirement. The chances of an imminent comeback are unlikely, with Lancashire beginning their T20 Blast campaign on Friday at Nottinghamshire, but Tuesday's announcement brings Flintoff a step closer to a surprise return. 'We are in talks with Andrew over possible involvement with the club during the NatWest T20 Blast campaign,' Lancashire said in a statement. Flintoff has embarked on a successful career in the media since retirement, featuring in a number of television and radio shows for the likes of Sky and the BBC. He also hit the headlines by making a brief foray into boxing in 2012, when he shed the pounds before beating American journeyman Richard Dawson in a poorly-received bout in Manchester.

"A woman who was so overweight that she was told she could die if she didn't change her lifestyle has dropped more than 100lbs thanks to a newfound passion for swimming. Vivian Stancil, 67, told the Los Angeles Times that she learned to swim at age 50 after being told by a doctor: 'If you don't lose weight, you won't get to your 60th birthday.’ Since then, the retired schoolteacher from Long Beach, California, has won 176 Senior Olympics medals, including a Personal Best Award that Olympic gold-medalist John Naber presented to her in June. Great loss: Vivian Stancil, 67, has dropped 12 dress sizes since learning to swim in her 50s . She has also dropped an incredible 12 dress sizes, keeping her doctor’s previous concerns at bay. Mrs Stancil, who is legally blind, was five feet tall and 319lbs when she received the grim warning about her health, and she could barely walk at the time. 'A bowling ball wouldn't even describe what I was,' she said. Mrs Stancil, who has been married to her third husband for 34 years, would frequent an all-you-can-eat restaurant  with a group of five girlfriends, nicknamed the Eating Club. 'I'd bring a Ziploc baggie, fill it with fried chicken and eat three or four pieces before bedtime,' she said. After trying various weight loss methods - including having her jaw wired shut - she turned to exercise. We are the champions: Mrs Stancil, pictured with swimming coach Dr Pete Andersen, has won 176 Senior Olympics medals . 'You're too fat to run or ride a bike,' a pal told Mrs Stancil. 'What about swimming? After all, fat floats.' She couldn't swim - and had never even been in a pool - but began taking lessons with Bob Hirschhorn, an instructor who had experience teaching older adults at Silverado Park Pool. Mrs Stancil, who began to lose her eyesight at 19 due to an inherited condition called retinitis pigmentosa, used sound and memory to navigate the lane lines, noting: 'Being blind helps keep your brain sharp.' 'I typically do 35 freestyle strokes in a 25-meter pool, and you can bet I count every one. Because nothing will ruin your day like bumping your head on the wall,' she said. Giving back: Mrs Stancil started a foundation to encourage other seniors to participate in athletic activities . As Mrs Stancil continued to practice the crawl, backstroke and butterfly, and adopted a diet of produce, legumes and lean protein, she shrank from a size 24 to a size 12. She began swimming competitively, placing third in a local Senior Games event in Long Beach, and went on to earn 176 awards at the local and state levels. She is now qualified to swim in the National Senior Games, and is preparing for the 2015 event in Minneapolis. 'My lifestyle change and this event have energized me,' Mrs Stancil wrote on the website for the Vivian Stancil Olympian Foundation, an organization she founded to help both seniors and young people become more physically active. 'I try to encourage others to do the same and be more active. I sometimes hear people with full sight say ""I can’t."" I tell them not to say those words to me because you can. Just move! Anything is possible.'","Vivian Stancil, a retired teacher in Long Beach, California, is legally blind due to an inherited condition called retinitis pigmentosa .

"From notorious flapper Josephine Baker through to Spike Lee's She's Gotta Have It and recent blockbusters like 12 Years a Slave, a new book recounts black cinema's journey through 100 years of poster art. Hundreds of images have been dug out from archives for Separate Cinema, which recounts the diverse and historic journey of the black film industry from the dawn of the twentieth century. Insightful in-depth text accompanies chapters on blackface, apartheid, the influence of jazz, Blaxploitaion of the 1970s (stereotyped roles), documentary film and much more, right through to the present day. Scroll down for video . A definitive history of black poster art, the book touches upon the vibrancy of the first black film auteur Oscar Micheaux and other remarkable works by independent pioneers. The earliest film poster featured is for American silent movie The Birth of a Nation, from 1915. While it was a commercial success at the time, the film was highly controversial due to its portrayal of African American men, who were played by white actors in blackface. Later, the tome revels in the 1920s to 30s jazz infused glory of controversial dancer Josephine Baker, while seminal films such as The Exile - which depicted an inter-racial couple - and Stormy Weather are profiled next to more contemporary classics like She's Gotta Have It. Recent Hollywood blockbusters like Monster's Ball and The Butler feature, too. The wealth of imagery is taken from the most extensive private holdings of African American film memorabilia in the world - The Separate Cinema Archive. The archive contains more than 35,000 authentic film posters and photographs from more than 30 countries, maintained by its director John Kisch. Despite black cinema's Oscar success in recent years, Kisch believes there is still a paucity of representation. Separate Cinema is released on October 6 for RRP £45 to coincide with the archive's 40th anniversary. It represents some of the archive's greatest posters published together for the first time. Harlem Is Heaven (1932) was one of the first all-black films ever made . The Connection is a 1961 feature film by the noted American experimental filmmaker Shirley Clarke . Sports documentary about Muhammad Ali called Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee from 1969 . Iconic performers like Paul Robeson, Ethel Waters, Lena Horne, Sidney Poitier, Sammy Davis Jr, Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy feature in the retrospective coffee table book. The fascinating visual history is accompanied by a foreword by renowned black history authority Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and afterword by Hollywood director Spike Lee. Part aesthetic, part nostalgic, the posters have deep meaning which crosses generations and transcends ethnicity. They represent a journey and remind people of the pioneers of the past, the courageous and daring African-American filmmakers, entertainers and artists whose dreams and struggles paved the way for future generations. Super Fly is a 1972 Blaxploitation film directed by Gordon Parks, Jr., starring Ron O'Neal as Youngblood Priest, an African American cocaine dealer who is trying to quit the underworld drug business . Foxy Brown, 1974, is another Blaxploitation film written and directed by Jack Hill, starring Pam Grier . Academic and foreword contributor Henry Louis Gates, Jr says: 'From the dawn of the silent era to movies screening digitally around the world today, black film, like any medium, reflects the journey of African Americans in society. 'And the posters these films generate and inspire constitute their own art form and pattern of representation, like a parallel visual universe, mirroring (not literally but figuratively, as acts of interpretation) what an artist or a producer felt to be the dominant message about race in America that these films contained: ninety minutes, say, reduced to one image, an image that over time, became both an icon and a work of art of its own.' Filmmaker Spike Lee comments: 'I'm proud to say many of the posters in the Separate Cinema Archive and in this great book are included in my own personal collection hanging on the walls of my 40 Acres and a Mule office... 'Movie posters are unique art themselves and I'm elated to see our black cinema reflected here.'

"It took four officers and two gunshot wounds to restrain a 28-year-old U.S. soldier on a drunken rampage through a German hospital Thursday. The soldier, who has not been identified, was brought into the Clinic of Grosshadern emergency room with a head wound at an Oktoberfest party. Upon waking up, he proceeded to tear a red fire extinguisher off the wall, wave it around, and threaten the patients along with the nurses and doctors trying to treat him. It took four officers and two gunshot wounds to restrain a 28-year-old U.S. soldier on a drunken rampage with a fire extinguisher through a German hospital Thursday . The New York Daily News reports the soldier even gave one 89-year-old patient a fat lip as he swung the fire extinguisher. The incident was originally reported by German newspaper Abendzeitung. The soldier, who had been stationed at the U.S. Army Garrison Grafenwoehr, was finally pacified when four Bavarian police officers were called to the scene. Far from going quietly, he ignored commands to lower the extinguisher in both German and English and began attacking the officers. Before he was able to hit them with his make-shift weapon, one officer was able to shoot him in the leg. He had to be shot twice before he dropped the extinguisher and gave in to the authorities.

"More than six months since Mark Zuckerberg unveiled plans to connect the world to the web using drones, more details have emerged about how exactly these flying Wi-Fi hotspots will work. At a summit in New York, Facebook's engineering director announced the vehicles will be closer in size to jumbo jets, than traditional drones, and they'll soar at 65,000ft (19,800 metres). The firm also announced it will begin testing the drones in an unspecified location above the US as soon as next year. Facebook has revealed more details about its plans to provide web access to the world. Drones as large as jumbo jets are set to extend the reach of Wi-Fi around the world. They will be powered by the sun and hover some 65,000 feet (19,800 metres) above the ground . Facebook aims to use a mix of solar-powered aircraft and low-orbit satellites to beam signals carrying the internet to hard-to-reach locations. The drones, flying at 65,000ft (19,800 metres), will be capable of staying in the air for months. They are relatively cheap and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals. The drones are effectively mobile phone masts in the sky and bounce smartphone communications between satellites and base stations on Earth. Low-orbit and geosynchronous satellites, which have orbits that match the Earth’s rotation and are effectively stationary, will cover more remote areas in Africa and Asia. The internet access would be transmitted in the form of free-space optical communication, or FSO, which transmits data using infrared laser beams. It could then be just three to five years until the super-sized, solar-powered drones are hovering  above remote parts of the world to provide internet access. Yael Maguire, engineering director of Facebook’s Connectivity Lab, told the Social Good Summit that the planes will be ‘roughly the size’ of a Boeing 747, but much lighter than the popular aeroplane, which weighs around 600,000lbs (272,155kg) without passengers or fuel. Facebook previously said the drones will be 'relatively cheap' - although did not specify a cost - and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals. The California-based tech giant has joined forces with Nokia, Qualcomm, Samsung and other tech firms to develop the planes in an initiative called Internet.org. Today, around 2.7 billion people have access to the internet, which is just one third of the global population. The members of the initiative said in a report that connecting the world is 'one of the fundamental challenges of our time' and they plan to do it using a variety of technologies, including drones. 'When people have access to the internet, they can not only connect with their friends, family and communities, but they can also gain access to the tools and information to help find jobs, start businesses, access healthcare, education and financial services and have a greater say in their societies. 'They get to participate in the knowledge economy,' the report said. A recent study by Deloitte found that the internet is already an important driver of economic growth in many developing countries. Yael Maguire, engineering director of Facebook’s Connectivity Lab said that the planes will be ‘roughly the size’ of a Boeing 747 (stock image), but much lighter than the popular aeroplane, which weighs around 600,000lbs (272,155kg) without passengers or fuel . Expanding internet access could create another 140 million new jobs, lift 160 million people out of poverty and reduce child mortality by hundreds of thousands of lives. In terms of how this could be achieved, Mr Maquire has previously explained that Facebook is 'looking at a new type of plane architecture.' The drones are set to fly at 65,000ft (19,800 metres), because this altitude is a point where winds are at their lowest. It's also above commercial airliners, and even above the weather, and this means the drones will be able to safely stay in the air for months at a time. ‘These planes are solar-powered and they sit there and circle around, and have the ability to broadcast internet down.’ Facebook’s founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in March that the social network’s Connectivity Lab was building ‘drones, satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone' The large drones will be capable of broadcasting a powerful signal that covers a city-sized area of territory with a medium population density, according to Internet.org. The large drones will be capable of broadcasting a powerful sThe drones will be tougher and able to fly for longer periods of time than balloons, while also being able to have their location precisely controlled. In March this year, Facebook acquired British drone maker Ascenta for an estimated £12.5 million ($20.2 million). The company is run by chief engineer Andrew Cox who has helped set records for the longest flights for unmanned aircraft powered by the sun.","Facebook's drones are set to soar at 65,000ft (19,800 metres)

"This is the moment a pair of burglars who were seen loitering in a suspicious-looking car on a residential street were caught on camera by a nosy neighbour - who they then tried to run over. When the neighbourhood watch member saw what he thought might be trouble in his street in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, he grabbed his mobile phone and began filming. He then approached the black VW Golf, which was parked up on his street, with burglary suspects Carl Armitage and David Hindle inside. Caught: David Hindle, 35, (left) and Carl Armitage, 24, (right), both from Bradford, have been jailed for a series of burglaries in West Yorkshire, after a neighbour took this photo of them lurking in his street in their stolen car . But the driver spotted the man and suddenly reversed towards him, narrowly missing him and smashing into a telegraph pole. Despite the near-miss, the determined neighbour managed to take clear photos of the car - which have now been used to help jail the gang with which the two burglars were involved. After they were sentenced, officers paid tribute to the 'brave' man, who they said had helped prevent further burglaries. The group had been responsible for a series of raids across Huddersfield in which they had collectively stolen around £10,000 worth of gold jewellery. The pair who were caught on camera by the man have now been jailed at Leeds Crown Court for their parts in the burglaries. Armitage, 24, from Bradford, was sentenced to four years in prison while Hindle, 35, also from Bradford, was jailed for four-and-a-half years. Despite their attempts to run him over when he approached the black VW Golf, the neighbourhood watch man took this photo of the suspicious-looking car outside his home in Huddersfield and handed it into police . Hindle had already been convicted in July this year of dangerous driving and driving while disqualified. He was jailed for 16 weeks. But the two men later admitted handling stolen goods after it emerged that the car in which they were filmed had been stolen during an earlier burglary in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. Another defendant, Stephen Drake, 33, from Knottingley, West Yorkshire, admitted two counts of burglary and one attempted burglary. He was jailed for four-and-a-half years. Joseph Devanney, 25, from Bradford, was also jailed for two years and five months and banned from driving for 12 months after admitting attempted burglary, aggravated vehicle taking and perverting the course of justice. Hindle, 35, (left) and Armitage, 24, (right), were jailed at Leeds Crown Court for their roles in several burglaries which targeted Asian families for jewellery . He had crashed a car and persuaded his partner to report it stolen, the court heard. And a fifth man, 29-year-old Scott Moore, also from Bradford, admitted burglary, handling a stolen car, common assault on a custody officer and possessing drugs. He was jailed for 30 months and disqualified from driving for 12 months. Detective Constable Iain Campbell, from West Yorkshire Police, said: 'The significant sentences given to Hindle and Armitage come as a result of a 15-month investigation which uncovered links between the pair and a series of burglaries committed across the Kirklees area. 'The determination of officers to put these two career burglars behind bars shows the priority we give to tackling incidents of burglary. After the five-man gang were jailed, a police officer paid tribute to the neighbour for his 'brave' actions in taking the photos, including this one . 'I would also like to pay tribute to the neighbourhood watch member who saw Hindle and Armitage acting suspiciously and filmed them on his mobile phone. 'When the men realised they were being filmed they reversed their vehicle towards the witness narrowly missing him and colliding with a telegraph pole. 'The brave actions of the witness clearly prevented another victim of burglary and I would like to publicly acknowledge our gratitude for their help.' The court heard the gang repeatedly targeted Asian families for jewellery. Raids happened in locations across West Yorkshire. Sentencing the gang, Judge Tom Bayliss QC said: 'It is perfectly clear to me that premises were targeted in this case for high value goods and that the individual burglaries were subjected to careful planning. 'Burglary can have a terrible effect on those who are the victims.'","Neighbourhood watch member saw suspicious car near Huddersfield home .

"We're now well into Movember, the November-long occasion when men grow a moustache for the 30 days of the month to spark conversation and raise funds for men's health. But as if men needed another reason to put down the razor, more than half of British women think men with bushy 'hipster' beards are 'sexiest'. A quick hashtag search of #BILF (which stands for Beard I'd Like to Fondle) brings up more than 16,000 results on Instagram. The trend is clearly not going anywhere. More than half of British women think men with bushy 'hipster' beards are 'sexiest' Movember sees men ditch the razor to spark conversation and raise funds for men's health . Despite a recent survey revealing a beard can make men look up to ten years older, more than half (51 per cent) of women prefer the bushy beard look on a man over clean shaven, a bit of stubble, or any other styles. The distinctive look - a full, heavy beard that falls beneath the jawline and is often accompanied by a thick moustache - is particularly popular with trendy twenty-something hipsters and male models. Celebrity sporters of the stylish face-fuzz include Hollywood hunk Tom Hardy, Gossip Girl actor Penn Badgley and lothario Calum Best. Nearly all of the women surveyed (82 per cent) agreed that bearded men looked more masculine, with over two thirds revealing they would prefer to date a man with a beard over one who was clean-shaven. More than half (51 per cent) of women prefer the bushy beard look on a man over clean shaven . A full, heavy beard that falls beneath the jawline is often accompanied by a thick moustache . Some women  determined to bag a bearded bloke admitted they had asked - or would ask - their other half to grow a beard if he was clean-shaven, according to the new poll. A further 38 per cent  added that it would be somewhat of a turn-off if a man was unable to grow a beard, saying it would 'make them appear juvenile'. Despite male grooming still being a sensitive subject for some men, the vast majority (84 per cent) of women said they found men who take pride in their grooming and appearance more attractive than those who don't - as long as they didn't take it too far like the men from The Only Way Is Essex or Geordie Shore. Most women (82 per cent) agreed it would be a massive turn off for them if a potential partner displayed poor grooming skills. The new poll found surveyed 1,000 women on their preferred men's facial fuzz, in light of Movember. A spokesperson for online beauty retailer Escentual.com, which conducted the survey, said: 'At the moment we are seeing a huge craze for beards that are fuller, but exceptionally neat and well kept. The smart, masculine look has been a top trend for men in 2014 and it doesn't look to be going anywhere soon.' 'We've seen a massive 92 per cent year on year increase in sales of traditional barber shop style grooming products like the Acqua di Parma Collezion Barbiere range, as more and more men have been embracing the trendy bearded look.' The popular social media accounts for the BILF movement have a sense of humour . It's meme after meme featuring beards of all shapes and sizes (generally the bigger the better; not always) Women said they found men who take pride in their grooming and appearance more attractive . The BILF UK Facebook page - for those who 'have a beard, admire beards or are beard-curious - has 7,000 likes, and the @b_i_l_f Instagram account more than 4,000 followers. 'Team BILF is made up of a team of people with a huge fondness for beards,' says BILF UK owner Vicky Scarfield, from Brighton. After she started the Facebook page, she found BILF turned into a huge community over night, 'which is when the idea to make T shirts and sell them for charity evolved'. 'Eventually BILF is looking at starting an apparel company, hoping to launch properly next year focussing on fundraising and selling good quality street wear. 'We are working with Decembearduk at the moment doing a raffle; if all the tickets sell we hope to raise £2,000 with the money going to bowel cancer. At the end of the year we are going to make a donation to other cancer charities with the money made through our T shirt and hat sales. We decided to support cancer charities initially because all the core team members (Tim Allen, Lea Turner) of BILF have all lost people close to them to the disease. 'We all work for free with the aim to raise as much money for charity as possible. 'Team BILF collectively run and admin all the social media sites with help of spreading the word through friends and colleagues. BILF as a hashtag did exist but we amended it to ""fondling"" because anyone and everyone can get invloved with our kind of BILFing. People now hashtag #BILFs and #BILFettes too.' Vast majority (82 per cent) of women agreed that bearded men looked more masculine . Men are sporting beards that are fuller, but exceptionally neat and well kept . Movember sees men grow moustaches for the annual campaign for men's health - and the official rules say no beards or goatees. The reasons for the poor state of men's health, as stated on the Movember website, are numerous and complex. They include a lack of awareness and understanding of the health issues men face, men not openly discussing their health and how they're feeling and reluctance to take action when men don't feel physical or mentally well. Men are also likely to engage in risky activities that threaten their health, and the stigmas surrounding mental health can prove a problem for them. The Movember Foundation aims to change this way of thinking by putting a fun twist on this serious issue. Laura Whitmore leads Aussie's Misstache Movement in Support of Movember at the Hoxton Hotel in Holborn, London (l) while Cindy Crawford posted a picture on her Instagram ' It's #Movember! I can't wait to see everyone's #Movember moustaches. Support this great cause at Movember.com!' (r) Using the moustache as a catalyst, the idea is to bring about change and give men the opportunity and confidence to learn and talk about their health and take action when needed. As a global men's health movement, the Movember Foundation has the ambition to contribute to improving the lives of men around the world. This will be achieved through programs we fund in the areas of - Awareness & Education, Living with Cancer, Research and Mental Health. Its aim is to reduce mortality from prostate, testicular cancer and men's suicide, and to help men living with prostate or testicular cancer to have the treatment and care needed to be physically and mentally well. It wants to educate men and boys how to be mentally healthy and take action when they experience mental health problems, and ensure men and boys with mental health problems are not being discriminated against. The United Kingdom Movember campaign raised £20.4 million in 2013, of which 88.3 per cent went to programmes supporting prostate cancer and testicular cancer initiatives. The rest supported admin and fundraising costs. Men and women can sign up to do a run or walk for charity, for example, to support the Movember Foundation.","Movember will see thousands of men ditch razor for men's health .

"Were Tottenham right to part with boss Sherwood? In the end, Tim Sherwood's showdown with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy and director of football administration Darren Eales went just as they had predicted. The manager went out swinging. Sherwood had known since a meeting with Levy on April 7 that he was a dead man walking and he did not hold back in a full and frank exchange of opinions during Tuesday’s early-morning meeting at the training ground. Levy retaliated and it is his belief that every time Sherwood talked during his seven-month spell in charge at Spurs, he slit his own throat. On Tuesday, Levy and Eales finished him off. VIDEO Scroll down for Sherwood's journey from happy-go-lucky rookie to troubled manager . Moving on: Sherwood was sacked as Tottenham manager on Tuesday after less than a season in charge . End of the line: Emmanuel Adebayor scores from the penalty spot in Spurs' final day 3-0 win against Aston Villa . Man in charge: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy informed Sherwood of his decision in a meeting on Tuesday . Tottenham’s chairman told Sherwood he was too unpredictable, with coded messages to the board and warnings to players littering his press conferences. Often they were spell-binding to listen to, a refreshing change of pace amid the guff often trotted out by managers in the Barclays Premier League. But Sherwood went too far. The former Spurs midfielder was told on Tuesday his behaviour was not becoming of a manager at a club with Tottenham’s traditions and history. Sherwood maintained he was just being honest. Levy, though, believed it was only a matter of time before Sherwood broke the golden rule at White Hart Lane by bad-mouthing him or owner Joe Lewis in public. Cross them and you are fired: just ask Martin Jol, Harry Redknapp and Andre Villas-Boas. This is one of the most prestigious jobs in football, but the consequences of falling out of line are always brutal. Sherwood knows that now. This was his chance to prove he could stand alongside men of stature such as Arsene Wenger, Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini. Instead, he talked himself out of the job. It’s a long road back. After Tottenham’s 4-0 defeat at Chelsea on March 8, when the team had been reduced to 10 men, Sherwood claimed: ‘I know the players I can trust and those I can’t.’ The boardroom winced. Then, after the 4-0 defeat at Liverpool on March 30, Levy almost had to call in the United Nations after Sherwood clashed with former Tottenham boss Glenn Hoddle. The pair have history. Opinionated: Sherwood's outspoken nature in interviews and press conferences helped cost him his job at White Hart Lane . Targets? Saints boss Mauricio Pochettino (left) and Napoli manager Rafael Benitez are being linked with the job . In December, Levy had afforded Hoddle, sacked by Spurs in 2003 following a calamitous run of results, the courtesy of an interview for the manager’s job. He was never going to be appointed. Sherwood, aware of this, reacted badly when Hoddle, who is a regular visitor to the Spurs boardroom on matchdays, criticised his players for their approach at Anfield. Hoddle’s observations about them leaning against the wall outside the dressing room before kick-off were correct. Sherwood was livid. ‘Glenn’s got a lot of opinion and he’s also got a lot of opinion about Tottenham, and he’s entitled to that,’ claimed Sherwood. ‘It’s been a long time since Glenn Hoddle’s managed a football team and the game has moved on significantly.’ Back in Hoddle’s day, when he attempted to freeze Sherwood out of the first team, the midfielder ambushed a board meeting over it. He has always been strong-willed. Nothing changed after Levy agreed to make him the manager on an 18-month contract following the dismissal of Villas-Boas. With a few decent results behind him against teams outside the top four, he maintained the club did not need to recruit players in January. Levy was happy with this. Then, after Spurs lost 1-0 to Arsenal at White Hart Lane — their third defeat by Wenger’s side this  season — Sherwood insisted he could ‘only play the hand I’ve been dealt’. Mediocre: Spurs finished sixth in the Premier League after Sherwood won 14 of his 28 games in charge . Honest: Sherwood believes Tottenham would've challenged for the top four had they not sold Gareth Bale to Real Madrid last summer . 28 games as Tottenham manager (14 wins, four draws, 10 losses) 1 gilet worn . 47 goals scored  during his  reign at Spurs . 42 Premier League points earned (13 wins, three draws and six losses) 2 Premier League debuts from  Spurs academy players (Alex  Pritchard, 21, and Milos Veljkovic, 18) 47 Goals condceded . 1 win in a cup competition (3-1) v Dnipro, February 27 . 141 days in charge . By then, Levy was keeping a low profile after conceding that he and director of football Franco Baldini had brought in too many players last summer. They were too hasty to rebuild after Gareth Bale’s move to Real Madrid. Still, Sherwood had his own aggressive transfer plans in place for the summer as he prepared for his first full season. There were proposals to bring in West Ham defender Winston Reid, Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry and striker Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea. Sherwood was convinced he could sign all three. He believed they would make the team competitive but Levy told Sherwood at their April 7 meeting that he was preparing to make yet another change. ‘You know I like experience,’ Levy told him. Sixth: Sherwood's last game was a 3-0 win over Aston Villa, which secured Spurs Europa League football . On Tuesday the chairman added: ‘Since . appointing Tim as assistant first-team coach in 2008 and then as . technical co-ordinator in 2010 and head of football development in 2012, . we have been supportive of him during management changes. I should like . to state our thanks for all his efforts during his years with us. We . wish him great success in his managerial career. ‘Now the season is over, we shall embark on the process of finding a new head coach. We have a talented squad and exciting players coming through. We need to build on this season, develop our potential and inspire the kind of performances we associate with our great club.’ As for Sherwood, he is disappointed but determined to return as a Premier League manager. MARCH 8 (Following a 4-0 defeat at Chelsea) There’s a lack of characters. Too many of them are too nice to each other. We need to show a bit more guts and not want to be someone’s mate all the time.

"A California couple has decided to end their 14-year marriage, not by divorce, but by uncoupling. Clark and Valerie Tate came together on a beach in front of their friends and 10-year old son, Jonah, to end their marriage in an 'uncoupling' ceremony, according to ABC News. Taking a cue from Gwyneth Paltrow and ex-beau Chris Martin, the Tates have decided to avoid the messy, expensive process of divorce and have what is called a 'conscious uncoupling.' Scroll down for video . 'Uncoupling': Clark and Valerie Tate have ended their marriage not with a divorce, but an 'uncoupling' Rings: In the ceremony, Clark and Valerie took off their wedding rings and gave them back to each other in the new age ritual . In the ceremony, Clark and Valerie took off their wedding rings and gave them back to each other in the new age ritual. 'These rings do not symbolize who we are to each other anymore,' Clark reportedly said in the ceremony. 'So we're releasing them,' Valerie added. By uncoupling, the Tate's no longer see themselves as being husband and wife -- though they technically are -- or romantically involved at all. That's about the only thing that will change in the lives of the two. Both will continue to live in the same home, --  with separate bedrooms -- maintain joint assets, and raise their son Jonah together keeping their family unit in tact while openly dating other people. Failing marriage: The Tates said that they began living as an 'uncouple' back in 2007 just five years after they began experience troubles . Clark: Clark, who had been married twice before, said that getting a divorce wasn't something he wanted to go through again . In an episode of ABC's Nightline,  the Tates said that their marriage began to fail, but divorce was never an option for them. Their main priority is raising their son and they were determined to shield him from the effects of their failed relationship. Clark, who had reportedly been married twice before told ABC News that getting a divorce wasn't something he wanted to go through again. 'We weren't considering really changing the structure of our family unit,' Valerie added. Their recent uncoupling ceremony was not a spur of the moment decision, the Tates had opened up about their planning for a fall uncoupling ceremony to the New York Times back in August. The Tates told the Times that they began living as an 'uncouple' back in 2007 just five years after they began experiencing troubles. The Times reports that in 2002 Clark had a major surgery and suffered the loss of his father who died that same year. When their son was born, Clark experienced added stress and Valerie felt neglected. 'I missed Clark,' Valerie told the Times. Clark said he had been 'myopically' focused on their son. Priority: The Tates said their main priority is raising their son, Jonah,  and they were determined to shield him from the effects of their failed relationship . Dating: Valerie is in a serious relationship and Clark is dating, the two have unwritten rules regarding dating and have decided to only introduce serious partners to their son . The two reportedly went to therapy in 2005, but by 2006, the two were not intimate and Valerie asked if she could 'bring her romantic needs elsewhere.' Clark and Valerie told ABC that Valerie is in a serious relationship and Clark is dating. They have unwritten rules regarding dating and they only introduce serious partners to their son. 'We give each other private time,' Valerie said. 'Maybe Jonah and Clark are out of the house, or vice versa. But most of it is, private time is spent elsewhere.' Clark said that the two are through their toughest times and are now in, what Valerie calls, 'the unknowns.'","Clark and Valerie Tate came together on a beach in front of their friends and 10-year old son, Jonah, to end their 14-year marriage in an 'uncoupling' ceremony .

She added: 'It's clear people love to get creative with costumes, looking for inspiration from pop-culture and politics to history, and even the make-believe and fantasy world. 'We're surprised each year with the range of different costumes, and I'm sure this Halloween will be no exception, especially given the historic number of people planning to buy costumes for themselves, their children and even their pets.'

"A former star college footballer who was set to be interviewed for a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship claims Yale's sexual harassment policy has almost ruined his life. Patrick Witt, who graduated in 2012, was due to lead his team against rivals Harvard in the final football game of the season - a match which could have seen him drafted for an NFL team. He was also announced as a Rhodes Scholar finalist, with the interview due to take place on the same day as his big game. Former Yale quarterback Patrick Witt, pictured, said his life had almost been ruined by an 'informal' complaint of sexual misconduct by an ex-girlfriend . Witt, left, had also been selected as a potential pick for the NFL draft due to his success playing for Yale - until the complaint. He denies the accusations against him but has not been able to clear his name because the complaint was 'informal' Mr Witt said he was also in line for a prestigious job at a firm as soon as he graduated. But it all came crashing down after his ex-girlfriend lodged an 'informal' sexual harassment complaint against him at Yale. While the process was supposed to be confidential, details of the complaint leaked and Witt says he has been unable to clear his name due to the unspecified nature of the accusations. Writing in the Boston Globe, Witt said that if the allegations had been lodged on a formal basis, it would have automatically triggered a fact-finding investigation. He insists such a process would have allowed him to clear his name. But because the complaint was informal, there was no fact-finding inquiry and he had no right of reply. Witt said he was assured by Yale officials he had no need to clear his name as nothing about the informal procedure would be included in his official record. But, just days after Witt was announced as a finalist for the prestigious Rhodes scholarship, he received a phone call from the Rhodes Trust about an anonymous tip-off concerning sexual misconduct. The interview never happened. He also received a call from the firm that had offered him a permanent job upon graduation, telling him the offer was being withdrawn due to an anonymous tip-off. When details of the complaint leaked, Witt says a good job offer was withdrawn, he missed out on NFL selection, and an interview for the Rhodes scholarship evaporated . Later, as Witt was training for a possible NFL career, the New York Times ran an article citing anonymous sources saying that a 'confidential' complaint had been made against him. Witt claims this destroyed his chances of a possible pro-football career. 'The complaint lodged against me caused me and my family immense grief, and as a simple Google search of my name reveals, its malignant effects have not abated,' Witt wrote. 'It cost me my reputation and credibility, the opportunity to become a Rhodes scholar, the full-time job offer I had worked so hard to attain, and the opportunity to achieve my childhood dream of playing in the NFL.' He wrote: 'When I demanded that fact-finding be done (at Yale) so that I could clear my name, I was told, “There’s nothing to clear your name of.” 'The Committee reassured me, the informal complaint did not constitute a disciplinary proceeding and nothing would be attached to my official record at Yale.' Witt is currently studying at Harvard Law School, and said he had to address the Yale complaint when being interviewed for a place at the prestigious college. Witt said that he was innocent of the accusation, but due to the nature of the process he was not able to defend himself. He added it was only a matter of time before another student finds 'himself or herself' reliving his experience.","Patrick Witt was  quarterback for Yale in 2012 when complaint was made .

"Stephen Lee is facing up to a snooker career in ruins after failing in his appeal to overturn a 12-match ban for match-fixing. Lee, a five-time ranking tournament winner and former world No. 5 will not be eligible to return to competitive snooker for more than 10 years. The 39-year-old had challenged the findings of a tribunal in September 2013 which found him guilty of fixing seven games in 2008 and 2009. Caught out: Stephen Lee was found guilty of fixing seven games of snooker in 2008 and 2009 . Stephen Lee is facing up to a snooker career in ruins after failing in his appeal to overturn a 12-match ban for match-fixing. Lee, a five-time ranking tournament winner and former world No. 5 will not be eligible to return to competitive snooker for more than 10 years. The 39-year-old had challenged the findings of a tribunal in September 2013 which found him guilty of fixing seven games in 2008 and 2009. They included deliberate defeats to Ken Doherty and Marco Fu at the 2008 Malta Cup, and agreeing to lose the first frame against Stephen Hendry and Mark King at the 2008 UK Championship. But Lee's appeal was thrown out by Nicholas Stewart QC, who also increased Lee's original costs order from £40,000 to £75,000. The decision means Lee will not be eligible to return to competitive snooker before October 12, 2024. The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association had initially pushed for a life ban but said they were satisfied with the punishment. The chairman of the WPBSA's disciplinary committee, Nigel Mawer, told Sky Sports News: 'There's a degree of sadness because Stephen Lee was a fantastic player and he's thrown it all away through greed and getting involved in match-fixing. 'Basically, as a result of that, he's now finished with snooker. He's banned now until he's 50 years of age, he's exhausted all avenues of appeal. 'But it is with sadness. It's harmful to any sport when there are upheld allegations of match-fixing. 'We do have a seniors tour and there are options for people who are older to play snooker if they are good enough but if you've been away from the sport for that length of time, I think it would be very difficult for him to re-engage.' Banished: After having his appeal rejected Lee cannot return to competitive snooker until 2024 . A statement issued by the World . Professional Billards and Snooker Association read: 'Nicholas Stewart .

"A pair of legendary Hollywood stuntmen famed for death-defying vehicular stunts in films such as 'Speed' and the TV series 'Dukes of Hazzard' have died in a car crash. Bob Orrison, 86, and his best friend and fellow stunt veteran, Gary McLarty, 76, died in the crash in Rancho Cordova, California. Their Chevrolet truck was being driven by Orrison when it was hit by a white Jeep, with McLarty in the passenger seat. Gary McLarty (left) and Bob Orrison (right), two legendary Hollywood stuntmen, died in a car crash on Saturday . McLarty, who appeared in more than 150 films, is pictured here performing a stunt in 1970 film 'The Losers' Orrison pictured in the 1968 Star Trek episode called 'Bread and Circuses' McLarty's wife Hillorie had dropped her husband off at his best friend's home an hour before the crash. She said: 'These are people who spent their adult life doing dangerous things in a calculated way. It defies my imagination.' Police said the Jeep was travelling at 55 mph at the moment of impact and the two occupants of that vehicle were hospitalised. McLarty performing in the 'Mean from U.N.C.L.E episode 'The Suburbia Affair' in 1967 . Bob Orrison raced the car known as General Lee (pictured) in the Dukes of Hazzard TV series . The retired Hollywood stuntmen had decades of movie credits on their resumes. Orrison, a Korean War vet, once doubled for big screen cowboy Audie Murphy, before moving to vehicle stunts on films like 'Days of Thunder', 'The Wild Bunch' and 'Rambo III'. He was the driver in the movie scene from 'Speed' when a bus drove off an elevated freeway, and was among stuntmen who raced the car known as the General Lee in 'The Dukes of Hazzard' television series. His sister, Mary Hunt, said: 'He was tough, that's for sure.' His wife Tatiana added: 'He was very young. He didn't feel he was old.' McLarty appeared in more than 150 movies, including  'The Blues Brothers,' 'Beverly Hills Cop,' 'Jurassic Park,' 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' and 'Lethal Weapon 2.' He drove the motorcycle up the frat house stairs in the movie 'Animal House,' and doubled as 'The Fonz' for motorcycle scenes on the 'Happy Days' television series. More recently, he was a stunt driver on Tom Cruise film 'Collateral.' In 2005, he also testified at the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, saying that Blake offered him $10,000 to murder Blake's wife, Bonnie Lee Bakley, but he refused.

"Australian DJ Mel Greig was ready to quit her media career after making a hoax call that resulted in the death of a nurse at a hospital treating the Duchess of Cambridge. Mel, who apologised for her role in the incident at the inquest of Jacintha Saldanha last month, spoke of her horror and disgust at the part she played in the prank. She suffered from severe depression as a result of the tragic event and was unable to return to her job at the station. Scroll down for video . Mel Greig was ready to quit her media career after making a hoax call that resulted in the death of a nurse at a hospital treating the Duchess of Cambridge. The DJ (pictured on Loose Women) has revealed that she was initially planning on leaving her media career behind entirely, but is now hoping to use the experience to change the radio industry in a positive way . But since arriving in the UK to appear at the inquest, Mel has started to consider a job in British radio. She made the revelation while appearing on today's episode of Loose Women, after being asked if she would consider relocating by one of the ITV show's panelists, Janet Street Porter. Mel said: 'If the opportunity came up, why wouldn’t I consider it? 'Now we need to think what can we learn from this tragic event, it’s not about me sitting here in the media saying poor me, it’s about sharing this experience.' Mel also replayed the moment when she first found out that the victim of her radio prank had committed suicide back in 2012. The death threats on Twitter surfaced before she was even notified by the bosses at her work. Mel told the Loose Women panel that she was on the receiving end of a barrage of death threats for several months after the incident occurred . She said: 'It was Friday about midnight in Australia, I was in bed and my partner was looking on twitter and saw the tweets saying, ‘You’ve got blood on your hands,' 'You’re a nurse killer,' and 'You should be hung yourself.’ 'There were these horrendous tweets coming through and then my phone rang and work informed me what had happened. 'I couldn’t go back to that radio station, I didn’t at the time want to continue with a media career. 'I wasn’t able to move forward, I had deep depression.' The remarks follow on from her speech at the Radio Festival 2014 in Salford, Manchester, yesterday when she said: 'I was disgusted with myself, that I'd played a part in this poor woman's suicide, it as very hard to deal with.' Ms Greig added: 'It was horrific. And at the time I felt that I deserved it, people were saying you deserve to die and I honestly thought I do deserve to die. 'I had failed as a human being - someone has taken their own life because of something I was involved in. 'And I believed that I deserved all those tweets, it went on for months and because I was in lockdown all I did was read the comments. Smart attire: Mel donned a blue dress dress paired with a deeper blue coat and black stilettos at the Radio Festival 2014 in Salford, Manchester, yesterday . 'So I believed it. I believed everyone in the UK hated me and wanted me dead. 'I believed everyone in Australia wanted me dead. There was not a lot of support at that time.' Ms Greig, who posed as the Queen while the Duchess was being treated for morning sickness at the King Edward VII Hospital in London, also said she was 'vilified the most' in the media backlash. In good spirits: Despite her emotional speech, Greig was in good spirits as she arrived at the conference . When asked whether she was treated differently because she was a woman, Greig replied: 'I have only just started to really assess this now. I don't want to be insensitive for the Saldanha family, this was a tragic event for them. I don't want it to be about me, I don't want to be the victim. 'But I was vilified the most. I don't know why the media fixated on me. I don't know if it's because I'm a female but it did feel that the trolling and the press were focusing more on me.' Presenter Daisy McAndrew, who interviewed Ms Greig at the festival, said: 'When I look at the cuttings, it seems to me that there is an element of that, he tends to be called things like youthfully exuberant or boyish. Disgusted: Greig, who apologised for her role in the incident at the inquest of Jacintha Saldanha last month, spoke of her horror and disgust at the part she played in the prank . 'It reminded me of a sportsman or businessman who get caught and are put on the naughty step, but if a woman does the same thing very often the media have a different attitude and she is going to be vilified and be a Lady Macbeth.' The radio host described how her family feared she would harm herself in the hours after she heard of the tragedy. 'My boyfriend was stood on the balcony because he didn't know what I would do,' she said. 'I was never to be left by myself. 'But I didn't sit there thinking that I wanted to die, I just didn't really feel a lot of anything. It was a constant feeling of numbness.' Appearance: Greig attended the inquest into Mrs Saldanha death last month . She talked about going to hospital for major surgery for endometriosis, a fertility condition, and said: 'I was convinced that that was my karma. That I took a mother, and now I don't deserve to be a mother.' Ms Greig also urged other DJs to learn from the tragedy and called for more measures to be put in place to stop people from pranking organisations such as emergency services and hospitals. 'I'm hoping that even if one person walks out of this room and it changes their mindset next time they're going to do something that might affect someone, then my job is done, I have achieved what I wanted to achieve here,' Ms Greig said. She added: 'The radio industry must question does the person know, is that person comfortable with the situation in hand before going ahead. 'A more stringent process must be put in place. 'We need support and we need to look out for each other.' On-air duo: Mel and her 2DayFM co-host at the time Michael Christian made a call to a London hospital in December 2012 posing as members of the royal family . She added: 'If you don't feel comfortable doing something, you need to talk, you need to speak up.' Indian-born Mrs Saldanha answered the phone call in December 2012 and believing it to be genuine, put the call through to the nurse in charge of Kate and it was then played on air by Ms Greig and her fellow shock-jock Michael Christian. A two-day inquest at the High Court heard Mrs Saldanha held herself responsible for the mistake, despite the private hospital's management supporting her and the other nurse as victims of a cruel joke.","DJ Mel Greig was ready to quit her media career after making the hoax call .

"It was that time of year, and shoppers were probably expecting to see revellers dressed tastelessly for Halloween. But the sight of Paul Dutton among the aisles of groceries and toys was beyond a joke. The 48-year-old, pushing his baby grandson in a trolley, was dressed in full Nazi uniform. Nazi fanatic Paul Dutton claimed on Twitter it was he who was thrown out of an Asda store in Cambridge after horrified shoppers took offence at his Nazi-SS uniform . Outraged customers complained prompting the manager of the Cambridge . branch of Asda to ask the Nazi sympathiser, pictured above entering the . store yesterday, to leave . The Hitler-obsessed father of six was wearing a black SS uniform and cap, with a red armband bearing the swastika, and swastika tattoos on his neck, chest and hand. While a few shoppers in the Asda store treated it as a sick stunt, others immediately complained to staff, who told Mr Dutton to leave. An unrepentant Mr Dutton went on Twitter later to say he had been using the Asda branch in the Beehive Centre in Cambridge since it opened three years ago and often wore his uniform. He said he had intended to hand out cards promoting his website, where he writes about his fascination with Adolf Hitler. Referring to Prince Harry, who had to apologise in 2005 for wearing a Nazi uniform to a fancy dress party as a joke, he added: ‘I got ejected from Asda for wearing something that is good enough for a Prince 2 wear.’ Shopper Rosina Rusin, 60, said: ‘My grandmother’s family died in the gas chambers and I thought “Here is this bloke parading about”. People’s mouths were falling open. ‘You are not going to come out like that unless you want to draw attention to yourself. One lady was very upset – she was close to crying.’ Marisa Baker, 38, said: ‘I saw the tattoo on his neck and a swastika on his hand. It’s not what you want to see, especially as there’s children around. Mr Dutton at home in Cambridge, left, and in the outfit he was wearing when he outraged customers in Asda, right. The uniform is similar to those worn by the brutal SS in Nazi Germany . Police were called at 2pm on Thursday, but Mr Dutton had already left. Asda said: ‘We had a number of customer complaints so we asked him to leave the store.’ On his website, Mr Dutton says his partner left him after he became fascinated with Nazism and claims that Hitler and Eva Braun faked their deaths and went on to have children in Argentina. He also uses a quote saying that the Holocaust was a ‘necessary evil’. Last night Mr Dutton insisted that he is not racist. ‘I don’t hate anyone... it’s not about the politics for me,’ he said. ‘I just live and breathe everything Adolf Hitler. Hitler is my whole life, it’s not just a hobby.’ The Waffen-SS, led by Heinrich Himmler, centre, ran concentration camps across eastern Europe where millions of Jews were gassed to death . The SS, Schutzstaffel or protective echelon, was created as an elite corps of the Nazi party. The black-uniformed members, began their existence as a small personal bodyguard for Hitler. But the group grew with the success of the Nazi movement to become a virtual state within a state. Leader . Heinrich Himmler built up the SS following from around 300 men at its . formation in 1929 to more than 50,000 by the time the Nazis came to . power in 1933. Himmler, a . racist fanatic, screened applicants for their supposed physical . perfection and racial purity but recruited from all ranks of German . society. The SS gained . power during the Night of the Long Knives in June 1934 when the Nazi . regime committed a series of political murders. Leading members of the left-wing faction of the Nazi party were slayed along with prominent conservative anti-Nazis. Many of those killed were members of the SA, the paramilitary brownshirts.

"A 31-year-old man has been identified as the main suspect in the deaths of three teenage girls who were killed in a hit-and-run while trick-or-treating in California. Jaquinn Bell allegedly crashed his Honda CRV into twins Lexi and Alexandra Perez and their friend Andrea Gonzalez, all aged 13, at speed as they crossed the road in Santa Ana on Halloween. The victims, who were reportedly dressed in dark costumes and black leggings, were thrown more than 100 feet down Fairhaven Avenue, according to authorities. They all died at the scene . But despite the girls' fates, Bell, from Orange County, reportedly sped off, before abandoning the damaged 2001 truck in the parking lot of a strip mall around a quarter of a mile from the scene. Scroll down for video . Main suspect: Jaquinn Bell (pictured) allegedly crashed his Honda CRV into twins Lexi and Alexandra Perez and their friend Andrea Gonzalez, all aged 13, at speed as they crossed the road in Santa Ana on Halloween . Twins: The girls, who were reportedly trick-or-treating dressed in dark costumes and black leggings, were thrown more than 100 feet down Fairhaven Avenue. They all died at the scene. Above, Lexi and Alexandra . Tragic: Andrea (pictured) was the third girl killed by the hit-and-run driver at around 6.45pm last Friday . The suspect and his two children, aged 14 and 17, who are also believed to have been traveling in the black vehicle at the time, then fled on foot, a witness told KTLA. Bell was arrested outside a Motel 6 in the 7400 block of Katella Avenue, Stanton, on Sunday following a surveillance operation by investigators, Santa Ana Police Chief, Carlos Rojas, said. He was later booked on suspicion of carrying out a felony hit and run at around 6.45pm last Friday, causing death, the news station reported. He is apparently being held on $500,000 bail. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Mr Rojas said the Honda CRV belonged to 'somebody associated with Mr Bell' and had been found by police sporting 'significant damage'. When asked if Bell was aware he had been involved in a collision, the police chief replied: 'I’m not going to comment on what he might have known at the time.' But he added: 'There’s no doubt in my mind that anybody who was driving in a vehicle that impacted three individuals... probably knew they hit something.' Too young: After the hit-and-run, Bell, from Orange County, reportedly sped off, before abandoning the damaged 2001 truck in the parking lot of a strip mall. Above, Lexi and Alexandra in a more recent photo . Dumped: The Honda CRV was later discovered in the parking lot around a quarter of a mile from the scene . Devastating:  Andrea (pictured), Lexi and Alexandra were all pronounced dead at the scene after the crash . On Sunday, Corporal Anthony Bertagna said: 'Witnesses say the vehicle was traveling at a high-rate of speed. I didn't see any skid marks, so it doesn't appear they slowed down whatsoever. 'They left these three young women laying in the street, and left without calling, without stopping, without rendering aid. It's hard to even fathom doing that.' Bell's detainment followed the arrests of four others in connection with the deaths of Lexi, Alexandra and Andrea, who were struck by the Honda CRV in front of Easthaven Elementary School. The other suspects - two adults and two minors - have not been publicly identified. However, they are believed to be Bell's mother and half-sister, and the two children who were traveling with him.

The adults have  been released following their arrests at around 11am on Sunday, while the minors have been placed into protective custody. Following Bell's arrest, Andrea's brother, Josafar Gonzalez, told KTLA: 'The people who did this left them there as if they were nothing. They’re finally in custody and have to answer to justice. 'That brings such a sigh of relief not just to my parents, not just to the twins’ family, but just to the whole community.' On Saturday, Magaly Huerta, the twins' aunt, said her family was in complete shock at having lost 'what we lost the most'. Speaking to ABC 7, she said: 'Why couldn't they stop the car when they saw my nieces? Why they couldn't do anything? I know God will punish them sooner or later.' Lexi and Alexandra's mother added: 'I cannot believe this.' The Alexandra and Lexi Perez Huerta Memorial Fund Facebook page was created on Saturday and asked for donations for the girls' funeral expenses. Family, friends and residents left flowers and lit candles for the trio following the tragic incident. Some remained at the memorial site all day as they tried to come to terms with the loss.

Sharon Stewart, who cuts hair at a nearby barber shop, told the Los Angeles Times that she was eating outside last Friday when she heard what sounded like a terrible crash and screaming. She said she turned around and saw a car leaving and people yelling, so she got in her car and followed. Stewart said she saw a young man run from the scene and heard him yelling at what she thought was his companion. Maria Ramirez, 14, who lives about a half block from where the hit-and-run occurred, told The Orange County Register that she attended middle school with the twins. She last saw them at school on Halloween, she said. Police cordon: Witnesses said they heard the squealing of tires and ran over to see tarp sheets already over two of the girls . 'I can't believe it happened,' Miss Ramirez said of the deaths of her friends, while she gathered late Friday night on the sidewalk with dozens of onlookers. 'They were fun, good girls.' Jeff Evans, who was trick-or-treating with his eight-year-old daughter nearby at the time said he heard squealing tires, looked over and saw the gruseome scene. He told the O.C Register: 'When we got over here, there was already a tarp over two girls,' Evans said. Briana Magana, 13, said she attended Santiago Charter Middle School  with one of the victims. Response: Paramedics rushed to the crash site but two of the girls were pronounced dead at the scene. The third died while she was being taken to hospital . She told the paper the pair had attended a school dance earlier in the day and had later gone for lunch at McDonald's. 'It's unbelievable how something like this could happen,' Briana said. 'She always had a smile, she would light up the room, and she was just a really good student.'

"A 29-year-old burglar has been arrested after allegedly feeding two toddlers, taking a shower and eating a meal at a family's California home. Jason Rutt entered three houses on Acorn Court in Pacific Grove through unlocked doors in the early hours of Thursday and stole items from their garages, police said. In one of the cases, he reportedly made himself a meal, before venturing into the bedroom of two children, aged one and three, where he woke them up and fed them bananas. Arrest: Burglar Jason Rutt, 29, has been arrested after allegedly feeding two toddlers, taking a shower and eating a meal at one of his victim's California home. Above, Rutt is pictured following his arrest on Thursday . He then allegedly went to the bathroom and took a shower. But as he was washing, the homeowners awoke to the sound of running water and called 999 as Rutt 'ran away' from the house. 'Rutt had entered the residence [on the 600 block of Acorn Road] through an unlocked door, Pacific Grove Police Commander Cassie McSorley told KSBW. 'He showered, ate, and then went into [the] children's bedroom and was apparently feeding the small children in their bedroom.' She added that although the children were not harmed, their parents were 'obviously freaked out'.

Forest Grove Elementary School, Pacific Grove High School, and Monterey Bay Charter School were placed on lockdowns as a K-9 unit and Monterey County sheriff's deputies scoured the area. However, Rutt was arrested that afternoon when an officer spotted him walking at the intersection of Patterson Lane and David Avenue, outside Monterey Bay Charter School. Lockdown: Following the three burglaries, Rutt reportedly spent 13 hours wandering Pacific Grove while police searched for him.

"An 89-year-old woman who had lived in the same California home for decades vanished for four years - and was found living in a filthy shack on the other side of the country. Sarah Cheiker had lived in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles for more than 35 years - first with her mother, then later by herself - but vanished without a trace in 2008. Concerned next-door neighbor Jim Caccavo alerted the authorities after demolition crews showed up to destroy her house. 'I was shocked. We figured she was dead,' he said. But there was no word of Ms Cheiker until she was found in Egdecomb, halfway up the Maine coastline - a distance of more than 3,000 miles - in 2012. Ordeal: Sarah Cheiker (pictured with her former neighbor Jim Caccavo) had lived in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles for over 35 years - first with her mother, then by herself - but vanished without a trace in 2008 . Previous home: Mr Caccavo alerted the authorities after demolition crews showed up to destroy her house. 'We figured she was dead,' he said.Above, a photo of Ms Cheiker's bungalow being torn down in 2008 . Distance: There was no word of Ms Cheiker until she was found in Egdecomb, halfway up the Maine coastline - a distance of more than 3,000 miles - in 2012. Above, she had traveled the breadth of the country . Authorities in Maine were tipped off about the remote location of Ms Cheiker, who had no known friends or family at the time of her disappearance, reported the LA Times. She was found in a desolate hut with a single lightbulb, surrounded by rotting food, in temperatures of more than 100 degrees. She appeared to have been living on just fast food and oranges. Jerry Pike, manager of Pine Crest Motor Court, where the hut was based, said at the time of her discovery: 'I can't imagine a gerbil being left alone in that cabin, much less an old lady.' Ms Cheiker was taken to Miles Memorial Hospital and, despite her ordeal, later made a full recovery, according to the Lincoln County News. Meanwhile in LA, a new house had sprung up on the site of her old residence, which records show was bought by a developer for $712,000. Authorities investigating what could have moved a vulnerable old woman the entire breadth of the country, and left her in such dire circumstances, learned of three new people who had come into her life shortly before she vanished. Suspects: Nicholas (right, in his mugshot) and Barbara Davis (left) - 41-year-old twins - and their godson Jonathan Stevens, 21, befriended Cheiker after knocking on her door at random one day, prosecutors said . The twins' godson: According to neighbors, the trio looked after her by taking her to doctor's appointments and the store - and even let her move in after fire damaged her house. Above Stevens in his mugshot . Nicholas and Barbara Davis - 41-year-old twins - and their godson Jonathan Stevens, 21, befriended Ms Cheiker after knocking on her door at random one day, prosecutors said. According to neighbors, they looked after her by taking her to doctor's appointments and the store - and even let her move in after fire damaged her house. After Ms Cheiker vanished in 2008, a living trust in her name sold the rebuilt house for $712,000, according to property records. Authorities said Ms Cheiker was taken from LA by the trio, who then dragged her on a financially ruinous jaunt across the nation, before leaving her in the shack. The three were charged with endangering the welfare of a dependent person - but pleaded no contest in court so were never found guilty. They are now on probation. Investigators believe the trio assumed Ms Cheiker would die in the cabin - and that they would never be caught. LA home: Cheiker lived on this road in Los Angeles, in a bungalow obscured by the tree in the photograph above, which has now been demolished . Distant: Cheiker showed up in Edgecomb, Maine, on a summer's day of more than 100 degrees (file photo) An attorney for Lincoln County in Maine, who prosecuted the case, told the Times: 'They purchased numerous properties across the country with her money. 'I've seen things that were egregious, but I'd never seen a person taken across the country, stripped of their assets and left to die.' Ms Cheiker was taken into the care of Maine authorities after they found her, and she now lives in a nursing home in the state. By the time the court case ran its course, all that was left from the trio was $7,000, which was restored to Cheiker. Rebuild: Public records show the home was sold for $712,000 - and a new home, pictured, now stands there . However, attorneys for the alleged exploiters claim they have done nothing wrong - and that they aren't able to clear their name because they're unable to subpoena Ms Cheiker because authorities won't say where she is. A defense attorney said: 'They were checking on her and bringing her food every day. She was like part of the family... she didn't like the noise from a lot of company visiting them that summer so they put her up in a seasonal rental cabin.

"In Michel Platini’s perfect world football would be a non-contact sport. The Beautiful Game, as described by Pele, would be a work of art un-desecrated by physical collision. Supremely gifted players – like himself in his glory years with France – would be free to paint their masterpieces on the canvas of the pitch without fear of pain or injury. Getting stuck in: John Terry and Ashley Cole put in a challenge on Norwich defender Martin Olsson . Possession would be gained by perfectly-timed nudging away of the ball from the feet of a rival, by interception, or by passing error or mis-control by the opponent. Thus defending would become a fine art in itself. All the energy poured into thunderous tackles and aerial combat wold be channelled into pace, power-running and kaleidoscopic movement on and off the ball. The UEFA president has long-envisioned the purity of such contests of supreme skills, high intelligence and creative imagination. That idealistic concept lies at the heart of Platini’s unease with the robust, headlong, get stuck in, up-and-at-‘em football which is the commercial driving force of the Premier League. This makes for super-charged thrills for mass audiences, if not for the greatest league in the world which it fancies itself to be. Platini cherishes excellence above excitement and every four years since 1966 the World Cup has come around to help him remind England that the game’s supreme prize goes to the craftsmen, not the crash-bang-wallopers. Now he is seeking legislation to tip the balance in favour of talent over intimidation. Platini’s latest wheeze – for which he has the support of legendary referee Pierluigi Collina – is to punish players who inflict physical damage by keeping them off the pitch for as long as their victims need treatment. Collina, now Platini’s head of refereeing, said this week: ‘It is not fair for teams to gain a temporary one-player advantage by injuring an opponent.’ Now, in that perfect world of Platini’s there would appear to be some merit in the proposal. Crunching: Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany throws everything at Chelsea's Nemanja Matic . But in the real football world, which sadly is inhabited by at least as many cunning cheats as true sportsmen, it is not only riddled with complication but fraught with the possibility for exploitation. What better way to nullify a genius like Lionel Messi than for a lesser opponent to feign injury after a first-minute challenge with him and then keep both of them off the pitch for the remaining 89 minutes? As it is referees have the devil’s own job discerning whether a player has dived or been fouled. Now they would have to decide not only if someone has been deliberately hacked down but if he really is badly hurt. And where would it end? If Messi‘s supposed victim was to be out for months, would Barcelona’s maestro continue to be sidelined until such time as that man recovered? Thunderous: Phil Jones of Manchester United crashes into West Brom midfielder Chris Brunt . As with so many of Platini’s ideas, this one is well intentioned but impractical to the point of naivety. With this man it seems you have to take the bad with good, the sensible with the eccentric. Platini is also coming round to favouring the idea of sin-bins, as employed in rugby for example. The rationale here is that it is better for such 10 or 15-minute expulsions to benefit the opposing team during the game in question, rather than to impose cautions which remove the culprits from future matches. Now this one makes better sense, since it would discourage not only the choppers but also the divers. But since Platini’s long game would appear to be to eliminate the honest tackle, that would take such qualities as courage and commitment out of a game which is supposed to be played by heroes. If that were to happen Monsieur UEFA’s Utopia would become a bland, sanitised, aesthetic but eventually unexciting place to be. Dislike: Michel Platini (left) seems to want to do away with that staple of the English game, the hard challenge . For more years than some of us care to remember this has been one of football’s cardinal maxims:  You win nothing with kids. In truth that should have been amended long ago to something like this:  You win nothing without kids but they need some shrewd older heads to guide them. Thus the real sanity of Roy Hodgson’s selection is not that it is the youngest England squad for more than half a century but that it contains that crucial mix of youth and experience. There have been mutterings among the most zealous reformers about the inclusion, for example, of 35-year-old Frank Lampard in the party bound for Brazil. Rolls Royce: Frank Lampard's experience will be invaluable to England in Brazil . But while Michael Carrick comes from the in-between years which separate Lampard and Steven Gerrard from such youngsters as Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, would he really have bridged the generation gap to better effect? While Carrick and has been unable to bale out that floundering Titanic called Manchester United, Lampard has helped keep Chelsea afloat. Not only is he the most prolific midfield goalscorer of the era but his engine continues to run as smoothly and tirelessly as ever. If Barkley promises to be England’s Ferrari against Italy, then Lampard is Hodgson’s Rolls Royce. Gerrard has been a similar driving force behind Liverpool’s resurgence. But unlike the England captain, Lampard has not yet had to modify his game to that of the creative anchor man in midfield. He can still lead the charge, as well as by example. Mentor: Lampard will be a good influence on Ross Barkley (left) and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . If England are to prosper in Brazil, the teenagers and 20-year-olds to whom Hodgson has turned to invigorate the stagnate pool of South Africa 2010 will need that experience to help them focus their energetic assaults on the best defences on the planet. World Cups are never all about flat-out attack. Often, these finals are played in draining heat and humidity. Always, they are refereed to standards far stricter than those applied in the Premier League. There are elements of building for Russia 2018 in Hodgson’s choice. But if a more promising future is not to be undermined by a crushing retreat from Rio, then the wisdom of the ages must play its part at Brazil 2014. Luis Suarez has been presented with the most historic and prestigious individual honour in the English game. In years gone by the diving, biting antics which almost forced his deportation from the Premier League would have precluded his election as Footballer of the Year by we members of the Football Writers’ Association – his marvellous goalscoring talent notwithstanding. Times have changed and standards altered. Times are a changing: Luis Suarez has been named FWA player of the year despite his dubious past . True legend: Sir Tom Finney was a superb footballer and a gentleman off the pitch . Striking example: Nat Lofthouse (with trophy) is another great of the English game . Iconic: Bobby Moore was the best English defender of all time and a former FWA winner . To be fair to the Uruguayan who will threaten England’s progress in Brazil, Suarez has been making a conscious effort to reform himself at Liverpool of late. Eventually history will judge him by how he wears the crown which has just been placed upon his head in London. Hopefully, when he surveys such names as Sir Tom Finney, Sir Stanley Matthews, Sir Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore, Nat Lofthouse, Joe Mercer, Billy Wright, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and, close to home, Steven Gerrard among the galaxy of previous winners, the message that behaviour matters as much as brilliance will be driven home to Suarez. Permanently.","Platini and Pierluigi Collina are trying to make football a non-contact sport .

"A woman who ballooned to size 38 has lost more than 20 stone after getting so fat she was forced to give up riding her beloved horse Rocky. As a teenager Faith Riley, now 42, was a slim size 10 and loved riding horses, competing in eventing, cross-country and shows every weekend. But her weight soared to 33 stone after an adverse reaction to contraceptive injections led to crippling depression and agoraphobia. By the time she was in her thirties, Miss Riley had to give up horse riding altogether. Scroll down for video . Faith Riley, 42, of Warrington, lost 20 stone after realising she was too heavy to ride her horse Rocky . Miss Riley's weight ballooned to 33st (left) after an adverse reaction to contraceptive injections led to depression and agoraphobia, but she managed to slim down to a size 14 (right) through exercising . As a teenager, Miss Riley was a slim size 10 who loved horse riding and competed in shows at weekends . She could no longer work in her job as a cleaner and a horse riding instructor, and hardly ever left the house. After making a firm decision to lose weight, she turned to her horse Rocky to inspire the motivation to exercise. Mrs Riley, of Warrington, said: 'I cut out all the junk food from my diet and decided to get back out there again.' Miss Riley was prescribed contraceptive injections when she was 23 after the pill caused her to experience extreme nausea and migraines. She said: 'In my late teens I was a size 10 but the injection caused me to put on four stone in one month. 'I was horrified. The doctor, who suggested my weight gain was simply down to my diet, sent me to a nutritionist, but I knew I hadn't been eating lots of chocolate or junk food. BEFORE . Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Chips, peas, gravy and an energy drink . Dinner: Lasagne with garlic bread . Snacks: Crisps and chocolate . AFTER . Breakfast: Bran flakes . Lunch: Ham salad sandwich . Dinner:  Grilled chicken and vegetables . Snacks: None . 'After a year of visiting the nutritionist the doctor agreed the injection had been a cause of my weight gain after all. 'By then, I'd stopped taking the injection, but it was already too late. 'My weight had reached the point where I felt I couldn't do anything about it. 'I became extremely depressed and couldn't face leaving the house. 'I had to give up work and couldn't even bare to see friends.' Over the next decade Miss Riley, who was also diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis - a condition which causes painful periods and abdominal pain, when she was 26. She saw her weight increase to the point where she had to stop riding. She said: 'When I topped 30 stone I had to stop riding. Rocky would have been able to carry me because he was strong, but I was terrified that I would be too much of a burden to him. 'I thought it would have been cruel to ride him so although I was heartbroken I decided to stop riding.' In 2006 Miss Riley attempted suicide. But after reaching her lowest point, following the breakdown of a relationship, she made a lasting decision. She said: 'I was 33 stone and wearing size 38 clothing. 'I spent some time on my own before I decided to get back to being me - the person I was before I became overweight and depressed. 'I knew it would be extremely difficult but I aimed to get back to the size 10 I once was.' Miss Riley (left and right after losing weight) used to gorge on chips, peas and gravy for lunch as well as constantly snacking on crisps and chocolate . Sadly Miss Riley's horse Rocky, who inspired her weight loss, passed away, but she is determined to stay slim . Miss Riley turned to her faithful four-legged companion, Rocky, for the push she needed to make her lifestyle change happen. She said: 'I knew Rocky would always love to go out with me. Although I couldn't ride him, I knew that spending time with him would always be useful to me. 'I put his bridle on and led him along the road for a walk every morning and every evening, without fail, for months. 'Sometimes motorists would pass and make horrible comments, but I didn't care because I knew I was trying my best and making a difference. Now Miss Riley is light enough to sit on a horse . 'I was determined to shed the weight to get back to riding Rocky properly. 'I also completely changed my diet, getting rid of all the high-fat, high cholesterol food and replacing it with high-fibre and healthier options.' Before beginning her weight loss regime, Miss Riley ate nothing for breakfast, followed by chips, peas and gravy with energy drinks for lunch. Her evening meal was commonly lasagne with garlic bread and she snacked constantly on chocolates and packets of crisps. As part of her healthy-eating regime, Miss Riley began the day with a bowl of bran flakes, followed by a ham salad sandwich for lunch. Her transformed dinners include grilled chicken and vegetables and the 42-year-old has rid her diet of snacks. Today, Miss Riley weighs 12st 8lb and wears size 14 clothing. She has been with her current partner, gardener Paul Bigg, 31, for two years. She said: 'I met Paul when I was still a size 20, and I'm happy to say I've lost even more weight since then. I'm very confident in myself now. 'I know I'll never go back to the bad old days of being overweight and depressed.' Although Rocky died while Miss Riley was on her weight loss journey, she is now looking forward to getting back in the saddle. She said: 'I'm now light enough to sit on a horse and ride without any concerns. I'm currently recovering from knee surgery but as soon as I'm healed I'll be back out riding as regularly as I ever was. 'I have Rocky to thank my weight loss. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be where I am today, and goodness knows what state I'd be in. I owe him everything.'","Faith Riley, 42, weighed 33st after suffering depression and agoraphobia .

"He showed an appetite for next year’s general election battle with an impassioned speech to the Tory Party conference today. So what better way to mark his well-received rallying of the troops than a visit to Five Guys American diner in Solihull, West Midlands, with his wife Samantha. He posed for pictures at the restaurant - shortly after promising two major tax cuts in his bid for re-election - and told staff the food had been recommended to him by President Barack Obama. Scroll down for video . David Cameron poses with staff at Five Guys American diner in Solihull after speaking at party conference . Mr Cameron ordered a hamburger and cheeseburger along with two Budweiser beers and a bottle of water and chatted with diners and staff while he waited for his meal. The couple spent about half an hour eating their £26.45 meal when they visited at 2pm today, but despite mingling with staff members didn't leave a tip. Manager Joshua Coelho, 23, said staff and customers were gobsmacked when Mr and Mrs Cameron strolled in. He said: 'He came in with a couple of minders and was very nice to us all.

But then Five Guys has long been a Washington DC favourite and, more recently, is developing a cult following across America.

They had a fifth son two years after opening their first restaurant. Now the sons, Matt, Jim, Chad, Ben and Tyler, are the Five Guys. They are all involved in the business.

I took his food over to him. 'We don't usually do table service but I thought I'd make an exception for the Prime Minister. 'He told me he wanted to stop off for some real food and that Obama had recommended it to him when he was in the United States.' The restaurant manager continued: 'He said he had just come straight from the Tory Conference. I asked how his speech went and he said he thought it had gone pretty well. 'He said he really enjoyed the food and posed for pictures with us before he left. He didn't leave a tip though but we didn't really care. 'He was also happy to talk to all of the customers and he was really well received by everybody.

"A new female action figure is leading a campaign to encourage young girls to challenge the traditional beauty standards promoted by Barbie and other mainstream fashion dolls. The plastic blonde heroine, which comes complete with its own construction kit and zipline, is the brainchild of toy company GoldieBlox, an independent start-up that wants to ‘disrupt the pink aisle’ and inspire girls to rebel against conformity and become engineers. To promote the new toy, GoldieBlox has released an edgy video that is reminiscent of Apple's famous Orwellian '1984' Super Bowl ad. It features an ominous Big Sister character who drones 'You are beauty, and beauty is perfection' as a line of pink-clad girls solemnly pluck identically dressed dolls from a conveyor belt in a dystopian factory setting. Pure heroine: GoldieBlox has created a new female action figure who comes with a construction kit and her very own zipline . 'Fashion dolls teach girls to value beauty over brains. One is sold every three seconds,' the spot tells viewers. Eventually a rebel wearing denim overalls and a toolbelt emerges from the pack with a hammer and smashes the machine, encouraging her peers to kick off their sparkly heels and have some fun. Set to Metric's Help I'm Alive, the clip ends with the action figure emerging on the belt brandishing a tiny hammer, as the words 'In 2014, GoldieBlox breaks the mold with an action figure for girls' appear on screen. Dressed for success: She comes in a tomboyish ensemble, consisting of overalls, red Chuck Taylors and a toolbelt . Hanging tough: The toy's ability to suspend from the 13-inch zipline is mean to improve children's spacial skills and introduce basic engineering principles .

"Middle-class children face being priced out of private education as an influx of rich overseas pupils pushes fees up. Independent schools are having to invest in staff and facilities to attract a ‘global middle-class’ and compete with schools in the US and Australia that are aiming for the same market. But the trend means British families must meet the higher fees that those from China and other boom economies are prepared to pay, private school leaders warn. Etonians at School: As school fees continue to rise, middle-classes could be squeezed out of places like Eton . William Richardson, the general secretary of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, said: ‘The global middle-class is absolutely vast, as is the money they generate.’ Research has already shown that average fees have risen four-fold in a little over 20 years, leaving private education increasingly unaffordable for parents in traditionally well-paid careers such as law and accountancy. Heads’ leaders have revealed that part of the problem is the cost of competing globally. They also said schools were handing out increasing amounts in means-tested bursaries to help Britain’s ‘squeezed middle’. In some, families with incomes of up to £65,000 qualify for help. The trends emerged at the annual meeting of the HMC, representing 260 leading schools including Eton and Harrow. In some, families with incomes of up to £65,000 qualify for help.The trends emerged at the annual meeting of the HMC, representing 260 leading schools including Eton and Harrow . Although some schools continued to serve mainly local families, others were targeting the global and domestic market. Mr Richardson said these operated increasingly in an ‘international environment with all the resources that entails’, adding: ‘For my money, this is a 20-year trend that I just don’t see slowing down at all.’ He said day school headmasters would recruit pupils in the Far East who might come to this country to live with extended family. Richard Harman, the headmaster of £32,850-a-year Uppingham School (above), said: ‘The costs of excellence in education are high, and to provide world-class education you have to put the resources into it’ Chairman Richard Harman, the headmaster of £32,850-a-year Uppingham School, told the meeting in Newport, South Wales: ‘The costs of excellence in education are high, and to provide world-class education you have to put the resources into it.’ He added: ‘Apart from parents in the UK who are making real sacrifices to send their children to our schools, there are parents from Azerbaijan to Germany to China looking to get the best education for their child in this country.’ A study this year said parents in accountancy, law, finance and academia were less likely to afford an independent education than plumbers were in 1990. Average annual day fees had more than quadrupled since 1990, from £2,985 to £12,700. Boarding soared from £6,800 to £28,800. A separate study by Lloyds on costs in 2009 and 2014 found fees up 21 per cent, while average incomes had risen by 5 per cent. Mr Harman said HMC schools now spent £365million a year on means-tested bursaries.","Research has shown that average fees have risen four-fold in a little over 20 years .

Middle-class families feel excluded from private education as privilege becomes more ‘toxic’, the conference was told.

"A three-month-old American baby girl was thrown from her stroller and killed in Jerusalem Wednesday when a Palestinian driver smashed his car into commuters waiting at a train platform. Chaya Zissel Braun's parents, who are US citizens, were among eight people hit. Israeli authorities labeled it a 'terrorist attack.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement today blaming his Palestinian counterpart President Mahmoud Abbas for increasing tension in the region. Scroll down for video . Israeli police officers inspect a car at the scene of an attack in Jerusalem on Wednesday. Eight people were injured and a three-month-old American baby were killed . Chaya Zissel Braun was brought to Israel with her parents when she was killed in a deliberate attack by a Palestinian driver . Surveillance video captured the moment the car plowed into commuters waiting for a light rail train in Jerusalem on Wednesday . Netanyahu claimed that Abbas 'just a few days ago incited (Palestinians) to attack Jews in Jerusalem'. He said that Abbas had called upon Palestinians to prevent Jews 'by any means' from visiting the Temple Mount in Jerusalem which is known as the Noble Sanctuary in Islam. Abed Abdelrahman Shaludeh, a 21-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem with a history of terrorist activities, was identified as the perpetrator. He was shot and killed by police while trying to flee the scene. The violence came after months of tensions between Jews and Palestinians in east Jerusalem — the section of the city the Palestinians demand as their future capital. The area has experienced unrest and near-daily attacks on the city's light rail by Palestinian youths since a wave of violence over the summer, capped by a 50-day war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. The car struck the train station near the national headquarters of Israel's police force. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the driver got out of the car and tried to flee before he was shot by a police officer. He said footage captured by security cameras indicated the driver deliberately struck people waiting at the stop. 'We look at this incident as a terrorist attack,' Rosenfeld said. He said the area was cordoned off and forensic and bomb disposal experts were on the scene examining the car. The footage, posted on the Ynet news site, showed the car turning out of moving traffic and heading straight into the station, accelerating while plowing through several rows of people. Dr. Yaakov Barkun of Hadassah Medical Center said a 3-month-old girl was injured in the attack and later died of her wounds. 'She is a pure baby girl who hasn't done anything bad to anyone,' Shimshon Halperin, the girl's grandfather, who is Israeli, told Channel 2 TV. 'She was murdered for no reason.' It was not immediately clear if the baby and her parents also held Israeli citizenship. Rosenfeld said the driver, a resident of the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan, was in serious condition. He added that the driver 'has served time in Israeli prison for terrorism.'  Israeli media reported he was a member of the Islamic militant group Hamas. Chaya Zissel Braun was laid to rest in a traditional funeral in Jerusalem on Wednesday night . The Israeli government informed the U.S. that Hamas was believed responsible for the attack, a U.S. official said. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. It wasn't clear, however, if the attack was the work of a lone wolf, the official added. There was no immediate information of any orders to carry out the attack delivered by high-level members of Hamas, the official said. Silwan, a predominantly Arab neighborhood, has seen tensions spike in recent weeks since Jewish nationalists moved into several homes in Arab areas. The home sales have been facilitated by nationalist Jewish groups intent on solidifying the Jewish presence in east Jerusalem. Palestinians, who seek east Jerusalem as their capital, consider the arrival of their Jewish neighbors to be a provocation. East Jerusalem has experienced months of unrest since a wave of violence erupted over the summer. Train passengers have reported Palestinians attacking the carriages with rocks and other violence. The unrest began with the kidnapping and killings of three teenage Israelis in the West Bank in June by a pair of Hamas operatives. Several weeks later, Jewish extremists kidnapped and burned to death a Palestinian teenager in east Jerusalem. Then, on July 8, Israel launched its war against Hamas in Gaza in response to heavy rocket fire. Israeli leaders called for restraint amid fears that the attack could lead to more violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the city . The car was driving full-speed when is smashed into waiting pedestrians, seriously injuring two, and killing an infant . East Jerusalem is home to Jerusalem's more than 200,000 Arab residents, as well as 200,000 Israelis. Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed the area as part of its capital — a step that has not been recognized internationally. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem as the capital of a future state that would also include the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement, blaming Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for adding fuel to the soaring tensions in Jerusalem with recent antagonistic comments. Abbas 'just a few days ago incited (Palestinians) to attack Jews in Jerusalem,' Netanyahu said. Abbas had called on Palestinians to prevent Jews 'by any means' from visiting a Jerusalem holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. He was referring to the hilltop compound sacred to Jews as the Temple Mount, where the two biblical Jewish Temples stood. It is also sacred to Muslims, who refer to it as Noble Sanctuary, the place from where they believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. The site is the holiest in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam, and a frequent flashpoint for Palestinian demonstrations. Jen Psaki, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, said in a statement that the U.S. condemned the attack and expressed condolences to the family. 'We urge all sides to maintain calm and avoid escalating tensions in the wake of this incident,' she said. Barkat said police presence would be beefed up in the city. 'We must restore peace and security in Jerusalem,' he said. 'The situation in Jerusalem is intolerable and we must act unequivocally against all violence taking place in the city.'","Chaya Zissel Braun was thrown from her stroller and killed .

"Candy giant Hershey have agreed a settlement with a small Colorado marijuana edibles producer after accusing them of ripping off the design of the company's iconic chocolates and candies. The firm filed a federal trademark infringement lawsuit against TinctureBelle in June alleging that their products Ganja Joy, Hasheath, Hashees and Dabby Patty too closely resembled Hershey's Almond Joy, Heath, Reese's peanut butter cups and York peppermint patty candies, respectively. TinctureBelle has now agreed to recall and destroy all edibles it sold that looked like the famed chocolate company's products - or had names that played on their brands. Candy giant Hershey have agreed a settlement with a small Colorado marijuana edibles producer after accusing them of ripping off the design of the company's iconic chocolates and candies . This means that products such as Hashees and Ganja Joy must be renamed before appearing on shelves again, abc NEWS reports. The company also agreed not to make packages with brown, yellow and orange colors, which are those used by Hershey. The world-renowned company claimed the edibles' packaging was dangerous as it could confuse consumers - especially children. But TinctureBelle insisted in court filings that it stopped making edibles that mimic Hershey candy before the lawsuit was even filed. In June TinctureBelle President Char Maye told The Washington Post: 'The lawsuit from Hershey came as a huge surprise to us because we changed our entire label line approximately six months ago. TinctureBelle's Ganja Joy was said to intentionally resemble Hershey's Almond Joy (above) 'Long before these allegations surfaced last week. Our new packaging looks nothing like Hershey’s or anyone else’s.' In its initial complaint, Hershey offered side-by-side photos of its candy and TinctureBelle's products, showing names and package designs that appeared similar. Mr Mayes added: 'The suggestion made by some media reports that our products are available to children, and even sold side-by-side with Hershey products, is dumbfounding, and shows a profound lack of awareness of how infused cannabis products are regulated, manufactured, and sold under Colorado’s strict regulatory regime.' The Colorado-based marijuana edibles producer's Hasheath was said to too closely resemble Hershey's Reese's peanut butter cups . Mayes noted that TinctureBelle products are available only in state-licensed medical marijuana dispensaries and only to customers with a doctor-recommended, state-approved 'red card'. He also highlighted how its products were in non-transparent, child-proof packages and are not sold in the state's recreational pot stores. Founded in 1894, Hershey is North America's largest chocolate manufacturer.","Candy giant filed lawsuit against TinctureBelle for ripping off products .

"The heavens are hosting an event this weekend that occurs once in a million years or so. A comet as hefty as a small mountain will pass mind-bogglingly close to Mars on Sunday, approaching within 87,000 miles at a speed of 126,000 mph. NASA's five robotic explorers at Mars — three orbiters and two rovers — are being repurposed to witness a comet named Siding Spring make its first known visit to the inner solar system. So are a European and an Indian spacecraft circling the red planet. Scroll Down for Video . Once in any lifetime: This March 27, 2014 image provided by NASA, ESA, and J.-Y. Li shows comet C/2013 A1, also known as Siding Spring, as captured by Wide Field Camera 3 on NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. (AP Photo/NASA, ESA, J.-Y. Li) The orbiting craft will attempt to observe the incoming iceball, then hide behind Mars for protection from potentially dangerous dusty debris in the comet tail. Shielded by the Martian atmosphere, the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers may well have the best seats in the house, although a dust storm on Mars could obscure the view. 'We certainly have fingers crossed for the first images of a comet from the surface of another world,' said NASA program scientist Kelly Fast. Spacecraft farther afield, including the Hubble Space Telescope, already are keeping a sharp lookout, as are ground observatories and research balloons. 'We're getting ready for a spectacular set of observations,' said Jim Green, head of NASA's planetary science division. The orbiting craft will attempt to observe the incoming iceball, then hide behind Mars for protection . Named for the Australian observatory used to detect it in January 2013,  Siding Spring will approach Mars from beneath and zoom right in front Sunday afternoon, Eastern Time. On Earth, the best viewing, via binoculars or telescope, will be from the Southern Hemisphere — South Africa and Australia will be in prime position. In the Northern Hemisphere, it will be difficult to see Siding Spring slide by Mars. The comet — with a nucleus estimated to be at least a half-mile in diameter — hails from the Oort Cloud on the extreme fringe of the solar system. It formed during the first million or two years of the solar system's birth 4.6 billion years ago and, until now, ventured no closer to the sun than perhaps the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune. It comes around every one or more million years. It will be the first Oort Cloud comet to be studied up close in detail. For comparison, the flyby distance of 87,000 miles is about one-third of the way from here to the moon. Siding Spring's tail could extend from Earth all the way to our moon. Its gaseous coma, the fuzzy head surrounding the nucleus, might stretch halfway to the moon. NASA's five robotic explorers at Mars — three orbiters and two rovers — are being repurposed to witness a comet named Siding Spring make its first known visit to the inner solar system . No comet has come anywhere near this close to Earth in recorded history. 'We can't get to an Oort Cloud comet with our current rockets ... so this comet is coming to us,' said Carey Lisse, senior astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University's applied physics laboratory. By studying Siding Spring's composition and structure, scientists hope to learn more about how the planets formed, according to Lisse. Scientists also are keen to spot any changes to the comet or Mars due to the close approach. NASA's newly arrived Maven spacecraft, for instance, will compare the upper atmosphere before and after it passes. 'Think about a comet that started its travel probably at the dawn of man and it's just coming in close now,' Lisse said. 'And the reason we can actually observe it is because we have built satellites and rovers. We've now got outposts around Mars.' Scientists initially worried the spacecraft orbiting Mars would be at considerable risk from the comet's massive trail of dust. The comet — with a nucleus estimated to be at least a half-mile in diameter — hails from the Oort Cloud on the extreme fringe of the solar system. The nucleus itself poses no danger of impact. But the particles in the tail, hurtling through space at 126,000 mph could fry electronics, puncture fuel lines, or destroy computers, transmitters or other vital spacecraft parts. As Siding Spring's path became clearer, the threat level was deemed minimal. Still, space agencies are taking no chances. They're employing the 'duck and cover' strategy. NASA's three orbiters — Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and newcomer Maven — will be behind the red planet at the time of peak danger. That's a 20-minute-or-so period approximately 1½ hours after the closest approach by the comet's nucleus. The European Space Agency also shifted the orbit of its Mars Express as did India for its Mars Orbiter Mission, or MOM, the country's first interplanetary spacecraft that, like NASA's Maven, arrived last month. The precautions are prudent, said University of Maryland senior research scientist Tony Farnham, who led a hazard-analysis team. 'Comets are complex beasts and don't always live up to our predictions,' Farnham said in an email Wednesday. 'If you don't want surprises, then don't study comets.' It will take at least a few days to obtain and analyze the best spacecraft data; but images made from Earth should be forthcoming pretty quickly. Siding Spring should pass closest to the sun six days after its Mars flyby, then swing back out, bidding goodbye, for at least another million years.","Comet is traveling at 126,000 mph and will pass the Red Planet on Sunday .

"Many wars have been waged defending a line on a map - or in a bid to draw a new one. But one data visualisation specialist has created a number of intriguing maps carving up the world according to mathematical rules instead of politics. Jason Davies, 29, from London, uses algorithms and datasets to divide our planet into new regions based around nearest ‘point’ such as a capital city or an airport, for example. Flying high: Jason Davies uses algorithms and datasets to divide our planet into new regions based around a nearest 'point' which can be a capital city or an airport (pictured). On this map it is easy to see that the U.S. is well catered for in airports, while remote islands are not . 'The Voronoi diagram is a beautiful piece of mathematics,' Mr Davies told MailOnline. 'It divides space into a number of regions, where each region contains all points closest to a particular seed.  The seed points can be anything that has coordinates: capital cities, airports etc,' Voronoi diagrams crop up in many places, including art and data visualisation. 'The most common Voronoi diagram works in 2D space, where the shortest distance from one point to another is simply a straight line. However, on a globe, the shortest distance is along something called a geodesic. 'You can imagine this as stretching a string between two points on a football - it will be a curve in 3D' In one map, he gives people an idea of what the world might look like if leaders only controlled the land closest to their capital city. He uses a technique called Voronoi diagrams to pick out a set of ‘seed points’ – capital cities for example – then divides space into a number of regions so that there is one region for every seed, consisting of all points closer to that seed than any other. This produces the mathematical borders and disregards language, culture and politics, which have traditionally been reasons to carve land up into countries and empires. 'The Voronoi diagram is a beautiful piece of mathematics,' Mr Davies told MailOnline. In a right state? Mr Davies' map draws new state lines in relation to each state's capital. If his map were real, some states including California, Texas and Georgia would be much smaller, while others such as Florida, Arizona and West Virginia would gain territory . Divide and Conquer: This map gives people an idea of what the world might look like if leaders only controlled land closest to their capital city, rather than another country's capital. If this division came to be, Scotland would be ruled by the Irish government and countries such as Belgium and Holland would make territorial gains . His latest map divides the world into 2,980 regions based upon the location of medium and large airports across the world. It is immediately obvious which parts of the planet are the wealthiest and most populated, with Europe and the U.S. for example being carved up into many more regions than parts of northern and central Asia or small islands.. The Voronoi airport map ensures that each region is closer to a particular airport than any other and highlights certain areas that are not well covered by air travel. Whole world in his hands: Mr Davies' latest map divides the world into 2,980 regions based upon the location of medium and large airports across the world (pictured). It is immediately obvious which parts of the planet are the wealthiest and most populated . Drawing a line: Another Voronoi diagram divides the world according to its capital cities. Here, Mexico is substantially larger, while the U.S. has lost considerable ground as its capital, Washington DC is based on the East Coast. The Bahamas is also ruling part of Florida . Mr Davies accessed a list showing the location of 2,980 medium and large airports . He wrote and and used a reusable library to compute spherical Voronoi diagrams in JavaScript, which is a computer programming language. 'It exploits several beautiful mathematical relationships, starting with something called a ""3D convex hull"", which leads to something called a ""spherical Delaunay triangulation"", and finally this leads to the spherical Voronoi diagram,' he said. Polygons are created within the Voronoi diagram and Mr Davies then uses the data visualisation library called D3.js to make it interactive and create a zoomable globe. The page which calculated the most remote points relative to the airports is under 300 lines of code and took Mr Davies just one evening to create. However, it took him 'much longer' to make the library. According to the map, the most remote airport in the world is Mataveri Airport on Easter Island. It is 1,617 miles (2,602km) from the nearest airport, which is Totegegie Airport on Totegegie Island in French Polynesia. Another Voronoi diagram divides the world according to its capital cities and the same technique is used to determine the mathematical boundaries of different states in the U.S. Mr Davies’ map draws new state lines in relation to each state’s capital. If his map were real, some states including California, Texas and Georgia would be much smaller, while others such as Florida, Arizona and West Virginia would gain territory. Mr Davies said: 'My work is primarily intended to demonstrate the beauty of Voronoi diagrams, in particular for spherical space, which I think is somewhat unusual.' He has written a reusable library to compute spherical Voronoi diagrams in JavaScript, which is a computer programming language. 'The majority of Voronoi diagrams are for 2D. I hope to inspire others to create more interesting and potentially thought-provoking maps using a reusable library,' he said. Asia re-mapped: Mr Davies uses a technique called Voronoi diagrams to pick out a set of 'seed points' - capital cities for example (pictured) - then divides space into a number of regions so that there is one region for every seed consisting of all points closer to that seed than any other.

"Harry Kane believes Tottenham have enough steeliness about them to succeed this season, despite a second-half collapse almost costing them in the Europa League. This is yet another campaign of transition in north London, with Mauricio Pochettino the latest man charged with bringing success to White Hart Lane. It has so far proven a bumpy ride for the Spurs head coach, although Thursday's 2-1 defeat of Asteras Tripolis means they return to domestic action buoyed by three straight wins in all competitions. Harry Kane rises to head home and put Tottenham 2-0 up against Asteras Tripolis on Thursday night . The victory in Greece was far from straightforward, though, as a shocking, error-riddled second half allowed Asteras to have 14 efforts of differing quality. A late Jeronimo Barrales penalty and Federico Fazio red card led to a nervy ending, although first-half efforts from Andros Townsend and Kane proved enough of a cushion to secure the three points. 'They came out of the blocks firing and they caught us on the back foot a bit,' Kane said of the second-half performance in Tripoli. 'It's disappointing the way we started the second half, but these are the sort of games where you have to hang in and dig deep. We managed to do that in the end and we are very happy.' Kane celebrates with Andros Townsend after his strike sealed the three points for Tottenham . Pleased with the result they may well be, but the performance again led Pochettino to speak of the need for his players to show more defensive resilience. It is a worryingly common complaint by the former Argentina international, who rejected England coach Gary Neville's recent suggestion that Spurs are 'weak' mentally. Kane, too, disagrees with such criticism and believes this week's performances alone show they can move forward. Asked if Tottenham have a steely enough mentality, he said: 'I think so. We had a great comeback in the Premier League in the last game [to win 2-1 at Aston Villa] and we dug deep to get the result here. 'We're doing well in this competition and if we win the next game at home to Partizan that will see us through. Kane celebrates scoring a late winner for Tottenham at Aston Villa last weekend . 'You can develop it through results like this because it builds confidence. We all stuck together out there today when it got tough and you can only build from that. 'When you go into other games you know that every player has got everyone else's back and you're going to fight through.' Tottenham will take that spirit into Sunday's Premier League clash with Stoke, when Kane will be hoping to make his first top-flight start of the campaign. Many Spurs fans have called for the 21-year-old to get a role from the outset after a fine scoring run, which he made eight goals in as many games against Asteras. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino has been coming under pressure to play Harry Kane from the start . 'The most important thing was to get the three points,' Kane said. 'We got the win we wanted - it was a tough game but we got there in the end. 'We're very keen to get the three points on Sunday in front of the home fans. We want to play well and impress and get the win.' If Kane starts to make a bigger impression in the league, expect him to be representing England sooner rather than later. Fresh from helping the Under-21s side qualify for next summer's European Championship, senior boss Roy Hodgson said at Thursday's squad announcement the senior team have their 'eyes on' Kane. Kane reacts as a chance goes by late on with Asteras threatening to earn a share of the spoils . 'I haven't heard about Hodgson but I will look out for it,' he said when told of the comments. 'It's great that he has been talking about me and I have to keep my head down, keep doing what I'm doing and I hope the rewards are there. 'We've got a lot of games coming up in a lot of competitions and I have to keep trying to impress and be ready when I'm called on.'","Tottenham beat Asteras Tripolis 2-1 on Thursday night in Europa League .

"In a bid to reinvigorate its range of PCs, HP has unveiled a radical new design complete with a projector and 3D cameras. Called HP Sprout, it combines a 23-inch touchscreen display with an interactive touch mat - in place of a standard keyboard and mouse. A projector on top of the monitor  scans objects, and it can track a user’s hands when using a virtual keyboard below. The PC is available for pre-order online in the US, before being released in stores on 9 November, and costs $1,899 (£1,180). More country release dates are yet to be announced.

"A wedding party with 80 guests - including 60 serving police officers - fell ill with norovirus after being served food 'unfit for human consumption'. The happy couple and the majority of their guests became unwell with the vomiting bug after eating vegetarian lasagne and fish pie during the reception at The Globe Inn at Frogmore, Devon. Pub owners John Horsley, 64, and wife Lynda, 63, have been fined £10,000 for using dirty cleaning equipment and unclean food at the party.

A wedding party with 80 guests - including 60 serving police officers - fell ill with norovirus after being served food 'unfit for human consumption' Happy couple and the majority of their guests became unwell after eating vegetarian lasagne and fish pie at The Globe Inn at Frogmore, Kingsbridge, Devon . Environmental health inspectors found unacceptable levels of bacteria on a towel used for hand drying and a pot sponge after the party last year. The court heard how the couple failed to keep premises clean and have a proper system in place to check hygiene. They were also found to have been unable to comply with food safety requirements. Prosecutor Graham Gover told the court: 'There was a report of an outbreak of food poisoning at the hotel which had been taken over by a couple celebrating their marriage and available for guests.' Inspectors found unacceptable levels of bacteria on the surfaces, floors and on a towel used for hand drying . John Horsley, 64, and wife Lynda, 63, who own the pub, each admitted three charges of breaching food hygiene laws at Torquay Magistrates Court . Ashleigh Harold, representing the couple, said her clients were devastated and deeply affected by the event and strived to do the best they could. She said the Horsleys notified the council the next available day after receiving complaints and have made a number of improvements since. Deep cleaning has now been undertaken and is done on a routine basis, with food areas redesigned, staff retrained and better food safety management systems in place. Following the hearing, Simon Wright, South Hams District Council's executive member with responsibility for environmental health, said: 'We are always happy to work with businesses to ensure that public health is protected. 'However, where conditions are consistently poor then we will take any necessary action to protect the public.' Norovirus, sometimes known as the winter vomiting bug, is the most common stomach bug in the UK. The virus is highly contagious. It can affect people of all ages and causes vomiting and diarrhoea. There's no specific cure for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course. It's usually mild and shouldn't last more than a couple of days. The period from when you're infected to when you start to show symptoms (the incubation period) usually lasts between 12 and 48 hours. You may be infectious to other people during this time. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it's not usually dangerous and most people make a full recovery within a couple of days without having to see their GP.

"A grandmother from Cardiff who was taken to Ibiza by her family to celebrate her birthday died after contracting a Legionella infection, which her family claims could have been caused by contaminated water. Lynne Balaam and her sister Kathleen Laddell, 52, both fell sick just days into a 10-day trip arranged through Thomson Holidays to the popular resort area of Santa Eulalia. Lynne died four weeks later on October 18 while Kathleen has made a full recovery and returned to the house she shared with her sister in Ely, Cardiff. 'Our world has fallen apart,' said Kathleen. 'It was a holiday to celebrate Lynne's 59th birthday. The family is in shock.' Lynne Balaam, who died aged 59 while on holiday with in Ibiza from Leginnaire's disease, her family claim . Lynne (right) with her sister Kathleen Ladell (left with partner Leigh Charalambos) who also fell ill on the holiday . The C'an Sanso apartments, where they were staying, were shut days after Lynne tested positive for Legionella and remain closed, the family say. Lynne's family have accused Thomson of not doing enough to help the sisters after they fell ill. A spokesman for Thomson said staff had been supporting the family and stressed that 'no clear link has been made between the apartments and the heightened risk of water contamination'. Lynne and Kathleen arrived on the Spanish island on September 22 with Lynne's grandson Michael Badham, 17, and Kathleen's partner Leigh Charalambos. The sisters soon reported other holidaymakers at the resort were suffering stomach problems before showing symptoms of their own within three days. Kathleen was first taken to hospital followed by Lynne. Kathleen was diagnosed with pneumonia and spent a week in hospital. Lynne's condition was harder to pin down but blood tests later showed her to have been infected with the Legionella bacterium, Lynne's daughter Emma Takata and stepdaughter Sacha Protheroe confirmed. The C'an Sanso Apartments in Ibiza where Lynne and her family stayed - they were closed after she died . Family members from Wales, who flew to be with Lynne in Ibiza on October 5 when told of the Legionella diagnosis, say they arrived to be told she had only days to live. A potentially fatal type of bacterial pneumonia that was first identified after an outbreak at an American Legion meeting in 1976. According to the NHS, those at a higher risk of contracting the disease include people over 45 years of age, smokers and heavy drinkers, people suffering from chronic respiratory or kidney disease, diabetes, lung and heart disease, or anyone with an impaired immune system. The illness is usually contracted by exposure to the legionella bacterium when it grows in purpose-built systems where water is kept at a warm enough temperature to encourage growth, such as air-conditioners, cooling towers, evaporative condensers, hot and cold water systems and spas or heated pools. Doctors told them they believed Lynne may have caught the bug from the apartment water systems. Sacha, who lives in Rhoose,  teenage grandson Michael was alone with Lynne when her condition took a turn for the worse and he was left to take her to the hospital in a taxi. Sacha says while Michael did all he could to help by rushing Lynne to the nearest medical support, the 17-year-old is now inconsolable. Lynne's daughter Emma, 29, who suffers from epilepsy caused by a brain tumour, was so shocked by her mother's condition she had a seizure by her bedside. 'I was told on October 1 my mother was ill,' she said. 'By October 3 she was in hospital in intensive care. I flew out on October 5 and went straight to see her. She was on a respirator, not conscious and wired up ... The shock of seeing her like that caused me to have a seizure.' Sacha, 34, whose father Joseph Protheroe has also now flown to the island, said the apartments are still shut. 'My father went there and says they are all taped up,' she said. Lynne Balaam (centre) with her family - (from left) her son's Gary and Barry, and her daughters Emma and Clair . Kathleen, 52, broke down in tears when she recalled how the holiday turned to tragedy. 'We arrived on September 22 and within two days we woke up with diarrhoea. A lot of people at the apartments had tummy problems,' she said. Lynne with grandson Michael Badham, 17, in Ibiza before he rushed the 59-year-old to hospital in a taxi . 'My partner Leigh took me to a private hospital through our insurance the following Wednesday because I was having breathing problems. I was in hospital for eight days and while I was there Lynne was taken to another hospital by Michael.' Unaware of how ill her older sister was Kathleen was stunned when she was discharged from hospital and went straight to see her. 'The first time I saw my sister was on October 8 when I was discharged. I was absolutely devastated to see her. I heard she had gone to hospital but was completely shocked to see her so ill,' she said. Emma and her sister Clair Pucky-Brown, 35, remain on the island as they try to repatriate their mother's body. They have been issued with a temporary Spanish death certificate which says Lynne died from multiple organ failure, despite doctors saying Lynne had Legionella. The family has been in contact with the British Consulate on the island. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Ibiza. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this sad time.' A spokesman for Thomson said: 'We are aware that a guest who stayed at the C'an Sanso Apartments in Ibiza has sadly died. Our thoughts and condolences are with the family at this extremely difficult time. Together with the British Consulate our team in resort has been supporting the family and will continue to do so until they are ready to return home. 'Whilst no clear link has been made between the apartments and the heightened risk of water contamination, as a precaution Thomson arranged alternative accommodation for all guests who were either staying in or due to travel to the hotel.'","Lynne Balaam, 59, died from an infection caught while on holiday in Ibiza .

"A government scheme to get rid of a rare species of wild parrot has cost taxpayers almost £1,000 per bird. In five years £259,000 has been spent trying to eradicate just 62 birds and 212 eggs. It means that taxpayers have been charged £945 for each bird or egg. A government scheme to get rid of monk parakeets has cost £259,000 over five years, and only 62 birds and 212 eggs have been eradicated . Monk parakeets, also known as form of quaker parrots, are native to South America. They have been branded a pest because they can destroy crops and make huge communal nests on buildings and mobile phone masts. But critics of the scheme claim the population is low with just 77 wild birds in the UK in 2011. Kate Fowler, the spokesman for campaign group, Animal Aid said: 'The government seems hellbent on killing a handful of parakeets at significant cost to the taxpayer, and yet its arguments for killing them just don’t add up. 'There is no evidence that these few birds pose a health risk, nor that they nest on electricity pylons or cause agricultural damage. Animal Aid spokesman Kate Fowler said the government seems 'hellbent on killing' the parakeets, despite there being no 'argument' for them doing so . 'Instead, the parakeets prefer to feed from suburban bird tables where they are much admired. 'If it is seriously concerned about monk parakeets living in the wild, you would think the government would stop the birds being imported into the country by the pet trade in the first place.' The colourful, intelligent birds are a popular pet - and many can talk. But a Government spokesman said they would cause problems if their numbers were allowed to grow, adding that in America up to £3million has been spent removing nests from pylons to avoid power cuts. A DEFRA spokesman said the birds were humanely killed if it was not possible to rehome them. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said they had not formally approved the eradication scheme, but understood the reasons behind it. Spokesman Grahame Madge said: 'We recognise the need that the species could pose a threat and therefore did not object to DEFRA’s plan to remove them. 'There’s nothing against monk parakeets themselves, they are delightful birds, and full of character. 'Our climate is changing, and if we get a warming climate in southern Britain, then each year that goes by the climate is getting more favourable for this species.' The details emerged after the Government’s controversial badger cull was slammed for costing £7.3million - a total of £4,100 for each of the 1,771 badgers killed. A second round of culling began last week. Monk parakeets live in colonies in London and Hertfordshire, with the highest numbers concentrated in Borehamwood and the Isle of Dogs. Business analyst Simon Richardson, who headed up a campaign to protect the Borehamwood flock, slammed the cost of the programme. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said they had not formally approved the eradication scheme, but understood the reasons behind it . He said: 'It’s a ridiculous amount of money. Why are we spending all this money on all these people and departments to pursue these kinds of aims?' He added there was only one nest in Borehamwood housing just 20 monk parakeets, down from 45. A spokesman for the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, a DEFRA agency, said the majority of the birds captured had been taken to private aviaries. He said since 2011, 40 birds had been removed from the wild. Of those, 12 had died and 28 were re-homed.","The UK population of monk parakeets was just 77 in 2011 .

The Gunners are aiming to end their nine-year trophy drought at Wembley against Hull City.

Arsenal supporters are being charged extortionate amounts of money ahead of this weekend . The one they all want to be at: Arsenal face Hull City in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday . Some online venders are asking for almost 40 times more than the cheapest available initially on sale; that's before tax and extra costs are factored in. Forty thousand tickets have been given to Club Wembley members and sponsors, among other groups. And that means supporters find themselves at the mercy of inflated pricing. Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis was less than impressed at the number of tickets available for fans - although that isn't a policy that's recently been changed. 'We are disappointed many of our supporters and also those of Hull City will be unable to get tickets to the Cup final,' he said. 'The balance in the FA's allocation isn't right. There will be many disappointed fans - who have supported the club home and away for years - who will be unable to get a ticket to this historic match.'
