"Intrepid: Jac Holmes has left his job and moved to Syria after becoming outraged at the atrocities committed by ISIS in the country . An IT worker from Bournemouth has quit his job and travelled to Syria to fight against Islamic State terrorists - despite having no military training. Jac Holmes, 22, has joined up with the Kurdish peshmerga militia and hopes he will be allowed onto the front line in the battle against the Islamist extremists who rule vast swathes of Syria and Iraq. He says he is keen to take up arms against ISIS as soon as possible even though he has never fought in battle before and has received little training from the Kurdish forces. Mr Holmes was until recently working on the service desk for an outsourcing firm which provides services to Bournemouth Council. But now he has resigned from the company and left his parents in order to go to the Middle East. He told the BBC World Service he flew to Iraqi Kurdistan, where he was met at the airport by a peshmerga contact and taken to a safe house in the city of Sulaymaniyah. From there, fighters smuggled him over the border with Syria - which is now partly patrolled by ISIS - and transported him to a camp in the war-torn country. An initial attempt to join up with the peshmerga was foiled when he was deported from Erbil airport in northern Iraq and forced to leave the country. Mr Holmes said he was inspired to oppose both ISIS and the murderous regime of Bashar Al Assad after seeing Western governments fail to intervene in the mounting chaos. Asked if he found the idea of fighting in Syria exciting, he replied: 'I see it as a necessity, something which if our governments were supporting the Kurds in the ways that they should probably wouldn't need to happen.' Fight: Mr Holmes has now joined up with Kurdish peshmerga troops at a training camp in Syria (file photo) Opponents: The IT worker is planning to battle against ISIS, left, and dictator Bashar Al Assad, right . He said that he was just one of many Westerners at the pershmerga camp, adding that those with military experience had helped him build his own fighting skills. Mr Holmes added that he was prepared for the possibility of being taken hostage, saying: 'It's something you take into account when you think about coming here - but I'd rather die than be captured by Islamic State, because we all know what sort of brutality they get up to.' He said that his parents were resistant to his decision to put himself in danger, but were nonetheless continuing to support him. Mr Holmes told the BBC he was likely to start fighting on the front line soon despite his inexperience. 'We are expecting to move out of the training camp fairly soon,' he said. 'There is an operation planned in our area but it has been delayed at the moment due to weather and we are waiting for NATO air strikes too.' However, a peshmerga leader insisted that no one was allowed to take up arms until they had been thoroughly trained in the militia's tactics. Conflict: Berkshire bouncer Tim Locks, pictured, is another Briton who is now fighting against ISIS terrorists . Last week, a bouncer from Berkshire revealed that he had sold his home in order to join the fight against ISIS. Tim Locks has joined up with Dwekh Nawsha, a Christian military group based in Iraq which is opposed to Islamic extremism. The Foreign Office currently advises British citizens not to travel to any part of Syria due to the civil war there which has raged for nearly four years. A spokesman said that British authorities would be unable to offer consular assistance to anyone who got in trouble in the area. The Home Office warns that anyone who travels to areas where ISIS is active could face arrest on their return, due to the high volume of terrorist groups in the region. 'The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq,' a spokesman said. 'Anyone who does travel to these areas, even for humanitarian reasons, is putting themselves in considerable danger. 'The best way for the public to help is to donate to or otherwise support UK-registered charities with ongoing relief operations.'","Jac Holmes, 22, was working in IT for Bournemouth outsourcing firm .

"The NHS budget for out-of-hours care has been slashed by almost 9 per cent in real terms in the last four years, shocking new figures show. Thousands of patients have been left struggling for medical help when their GP is unavailable, flooding the NHS 111 helpline with calls and causing huge pressures at A&E departments. Now ministers have admitted that the total amount of money available for care in evenings and at weekends was £40million lower in real terms last year than in 2009-10. In 2013-14, there was £399.4million available for out of hours care in England but using 2013-14 prices to take into account the effect of inflation, it was worth £438.4million in 2009-10, the year before the coalition was formed . Hospitals in England have failed to meet waiting time targets in A&E for five months running. The crisis has been blamed in part on people who are sick and injured being unable to see their GP. New figures today showed the NHS is 'greater than ever before' as it emerged 900 more patients are being admitted to hospital every day compared with a year ago. The government insists it has invested extra money into helping health trusts to deal with the rise. David Cameron has insisted the NHS has risen in real terms under the coalition. In his party conference speech last year he declared: 'We in this party can be proud of what we've done. We came in and protected the NHS budget. 'The next Conservative Government will protect the NHS budget and continue to invest more.' But official figures reveal how the amount of money available for out of hours care has fallen year after year. In 2013-14, there was £399.4million available for out of hours care in England. But using 2013-14 prices to take into account the effect of inflation, it was worth £404,660 a year earlier and hit £438.4million in 2009-10, the year before the coalition was formed. It means out-of-hours spending last year was lower than at any point since 2007-08. Jamie Reed, Labour's shadow health minister, said: 'It is shocking that despite his promise to protect the NHS, David Cameron has cut out-of-hours care at the same time as wasting £3billion on a damaging NHS reorganisation he promised wouldn't happen. 'As a result, out-of-hours care is going downhill under the Tory-led Government, with patient satisfaction declining significantly since 2010. It is proof that you cannot trust David Cameron with the NHS.' The figures were released by health minister Dan Poulter in response to a parliamentary question. It shows how much has been spent on out-of-hours care since 2004, when GPs stopped being responsible for their patients at evenings and weekends as part of a lucrative new pay deal agreed by Labour. Mr Poulter said: 'This Government has sought to improve access through the Prime Minister's Challenge Fund, which is making available £50 million this year and £100 million next year to improve access to general practice.' Hospitals across England have failed to meet waiting time targets in A&E for the last 20 weeks . But the latest set of figures, published last week, reveal the misery for patients is ongoing, with no end in sight for medical staff who are under mounting pressure. NHS England said 91.6 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival in A&E to being admitted to hospital, transferred or discharged. The figures revealed performance for the week ending February 15 and is down from 92.9 per cent the previous week - short of the 95 per cent target. The damning statistics marked the 20th consecutive week that the A&E target has been missed. New figures published today by the Health and Social Care Information Centre reveal NHS hospitals in England dealt with 15.5 million admissions in 2013-14. That figure equates to 42,400 patients being admitted each day - 870 more on average than the previous year. Those aged 65 to 69 were most likely to be admitted to hospital, and the age group saw the greatest increase in admissions, up 66,000 from the previous year to 1.3 million. Falls accounted for 421,800 admissions, an increase of 11,000 from 2012-13, with patients aged over 65 most likely to suffer a fall.","Cash for care in evenings and weekends has fallen every year from 2009-10 .

"Erich Nowsch, the suspect in the 'road rage' slaying of mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, was high on marijuana while police questioned him following his arrest - and detectives knew it, his defense lawyers said today. Nowsch, 19, had smoked pot before surrendering himself in the midst of a standoff with Las Vegas police, according to his attorney Augustus Claus. Claus said he plans to argue in court that anything Nowsch told investigators after he was taken into custody can no longer be used in the impending murder trial. It's not clear what Nowsch told detectives after his arrest. Erich Nowsch's defense lawyers claim that police knew the 19-year-old was high during questioning . His attorney Augustus Claus claims that police 'watched' Nowsch smoke pot before he surrendered during a standoff with police (pictured) at his Las Vegas home . Claus said it could now be argued that anything Nowsch told investigators after he was taken into custody can no longer be used in the impending murder trial . 'People tend to say things that aren't entirely credible when they're under the influence,' he told the Associated Press. Claus said 'not only' did the police let Nowsch smoke, they 'watched him do it' as they tried 'to talk him down' during a standoff that involved a helicopter and a SWAT team. The allegation was just the latest in a string of turns that has plagued what was initially thought to be a 'road rage' murder. Yesterday local resident Robert Selig said Meyers, 44, was killed in a 'drug deal gone bad'. 'The son and mother left the Meyers residence looking for Eric on a drug deal gone bad,' he said. 'That's the word on the street. A prescription drug deal gone bad.' Selig said he believes Meyers went to the park to pick up pharmaceutical pills 'like Xanax' from Erich. 'The kid sold it right there at that concrete table, day in day out,' he said. The Meyers family initially claimed that Meyers had gotten into an argument with Nowsch while giving her daughter a driving lesson on the night of the February 12 shooting. They said Nowsch followed them home and shot at them. It has since emerged that Meyers went home and recruited her son Brandon, who brought his handgun, to help her look for Nowsch after the late-night altercation. Tammy Meyers, 44, was shot in the head in what initially appeared to be a road-rage incident involving Nowsch . Robert Meyers watched in court as his wife's alleged murderer made his first appearance. He said he would be present at every hearing . Erich Nowsch, left, with his attorney Conrad Claus as he is arraigned for the alleged murder of Tammy Meyers after a confrontation between him and her and her armed son . Meyers was shot in the head and died after two days on life-support. Claus said he believes Nowsch will be able to claim self-defense because Brandon Meyers was armed. Nowsch appeared in court in Las Vegas on Monday to be arraigned. His preliminary hearing was set for March 10. Sitting on the public benches was Tammy's widower, Robert Meyers, who stared intently at Nowsch throughout the five-minute hearing. As he left court he told MailOnline: 'I'll be here every court date. You'll see me here at every hearing. 'That's what Tammy would want.' Outside the hearing district attorney Steven B Wolfson told Daily Mail Online: 'There's been some speculation about drugs and drug use - but that's not the heart of the case. 'The center focus of this case is the interaction between adults which occurred one night - that's the focus. Somebody lost their life and it was stupid.' Last week it was revealed that the Meyers family actually knew Nowsch. Daily Mail Online has learned Nowsch is believed to have been affiliated with a gang called Alpha Block. In a number of his Instagram pictures, he appears to be smoking marijuana . Nowsch told friends he had been involved in a shooting  and had fired 22 shots at a single location, according to a police report . Mrs Meyers husband Robert, who claims police told him to keep his family's relationship with the suspect a secret, described how his wife had consoled Nowsch, would tell him to pull his pants up around the neighborhood and tried to teach him how to be a man. Mr Meyers told reporters outside his home on Thursday: 'We know this boy. I couldn't tell you this before. He knew where I lived.' 'We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know it was this bad. That he'd gotten to this point, and his friends.' It is rumored that Nowsch has been affiliated with a gang called Alpha Block. Nowsch posted a picture of him lighting up and taking a hit from a bong on Instagram . Another image posted on his Instagram appears to show more of the drug spread out on a glass slab . Local resident Colorado Wright, who knew both the Meyers' three sons as well as Nowsch, said the latter was known for being mixed up in drugs - including 'weed, meth probably, molly, ecstasy'. 'He was always dealing drugs,' Wright said. 'He had a moped at one time and he would go up and down the streets in this neighborhood selling to everybody.' 'He'd be walking down the street yelling out ""I got weed"" so loud and brazen about it'. 'Most definitely he'd have been under the influence of drugs on the night of the shooting'. Last week it was revealed that the Meyers family actually knew Nowsch.  Mr Meyers told reporters outside his home on Thursday: 'We know this boy. We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know it was this bad' Meyers was taken off life support after she failed to recover from the injuries she sustained in the incident . Daily Mail Online spoke to one person who has known Nowsch for a number of years – who asked not to be named – and he said three years ago Nowsch only had one tattoo and was always getting picked on by bigger kids. The source explained: 'Baby G, everybody called him that because he was so small. He's 19 but looks 14. He had to take pills just to grow. 'Everyone kept on robbing him and robbing him. I think he got a gun because he was getting robbed.' According to the Associated Press, police said Nowsch showed his friends a .45-caliber handgun after the shooting and bragged that he had 'got those kids' who were after him. Nowsch then claimed he fired several shots during the first altercation and 22 shots in the cul-de-sac where Meyers was killed, according to a police report. He has been charged with murder, attempted murder and discharge of a gun within a vehicle. Las Vegas police are still searching for a second suspect they believe was Nowsch's accomplice. February 13 - Las Vegas police reveal a mother-of-four is shot during an alleged road rage incident. She was later identified as Tammy Meyers. She was teaching her 15-year-old daughter Kristal to drive at the time. February 15 - Her devastated husband, Robert Meyers, vows to find whoever did this to his wife. He turned off her life support after she failed to recover from her injuries sustained in the incident on Valentine's Day. February 16 -  CCTV of the incident is released by police as they hunt for the alleged killer and his accomplice. Police also disclose a sketch of the suspect and say he is 6ft, mid 20s and 180lbs. February 18 - Questions are raised over whether Nowsch acted in self-defense amid claims Mrs Meyers drove back to her home, dropped her daughter off, grabbed her son Brandon and hunted down the car in question. In response, Mr Meyers insists his son is a hero and not a vigilante. February 19 - Following a tense stand-off with police Eric Nowsch is arrested. Mr Meyers claims he knew the suspect and said he knew the kid was bad. After the incident he claimed he wasn't aware who shot his wife. Added that his wife consoled the youngsters for hours and tried to teach him how to be a man.

"The Arctic could be completely free of ice in just 40 years as a result of global warming, one of the world's leading climate change experts has warned. Nobel Peace Prize winner Professor Oleg Anisimov said there is evidence that temperatures are rising four times faster in the frozen region than the rest of the planet. This means that there will only be open water in the polar region by the 2050s, with nothing more than a few floating icebergs at the North Pole, according to the Russian academic. Alarming: The Arctic could be completely free of ice in just 40 years as a result of global warming, one of the world's leading climate change experts has warned. This map shows rates of erosion on the Arctic coast, with the fastest rates marked in red . Professor Anisimov, from the State Hydrological Institute in St Petersburg, gave his stark warning during a lecture in the Sakha Republic - the coldest part of Russia. He forecasts that the region will see temperature rises of up to 7°C within a century. ‘For several reasons, the Arctic climate change is more intense and faster than in other regions. There is a reduction in snow and ice cover, which has a protective function,’ he said. ‘On average over the last year, the minimum area of sea ice has decreased from 5.4 to 5.3 million square kilometres [two million square miles]. Over the past 10 years, the reduction of sea ice in the Arctic was by 13.7 per cent. Shocking pictures from Siberia (one is pictured) show the collapse of buildings due to melting permafrost. According to environmentalists, as the snow and ice melts, the ability of the Arctic region to reflect heat back into space is reduced and the rate of global warming is accelerated once more . Nobel Peace Prize winner Professor Oleg Anisimov (pictured) said there is evidence that temperatures are rising four times faster in the frozen region than the rest of the planet . ‘By the middle of the century it may be that the Arctic Ocean will be completely ice free.’ Environmentalists and climate change scientists have long known about the potential disaster in the Arctic as a result of rising global temperatures. The Yakutia region is experiencing climate change at a rapid rate and a 1884 map (pictured) shows Arctic islands that have already vanished . The sea ice is already at the lowest ever level recorded, with the WWF warning that a rise of just 2°C would be enough to melt the remaining floes. As well as rising sea waters, climate change could threaten delicate ecosystems and marine life. According to environmentalists, as the snow and ice melts, the ability of the Arctic region to reflect heat back into space is reduced and the rate of global warming is accelerated once more. This could spark increasing numbers of forest fires and unpredictable storms and, at worst, bring a halt to the Gulf Stream which warms Europe. The Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia, is experiencing climate change at a quicker rate than other parts of the world, The Siberian Times reported. A map of the region from 1884 is already radically different to today's, with Arctic islands having vanished under rising sea waters. Professor Anisimov predicts overall increases of about 7°C by next century in Russia's frozen north. Shocking pictures from Siberia highlighted by the academic show the collapse of buildings due to melting permafrost. In 2007, as part of an Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for research on the impact of global warming, and is considered one of the world's most eminent experts on the subject. He said: ‘If the global temperature got warmer by 0.85°C in 100 years, in Yakutia the winter temperature will have increased by 3.5°C. Professor Anisimov said: ‘If the global temperature got warmer by 0.85°C in 100 years, in Yakutia the winter temperature will have increased by 3.5°C.' This picture shows s house destroyed by melting ice on Yenisey - the largest river system flowing to the Arctic Ocean . As well as erosion (areas of which are marked on this map), climate change has been blamed for the series of unexplained craters appearing throughout Russia . ‘That is, global warming here is four times faster. According to our forecasts, the temperature in the north will increase by six to seven degrees by the 2100s.’ Other scientists have already speculated that global warming could be partly responsible for the series of unexplained craters appearing throughout Russia. They believe warming air is melting thick permafrost, leading to the accumulation and release of volatile ‘fire ice’ gases which then explode to create the giant craters. Almost two thirds of the Russian land mass lies within a permafrost zone and there are concerns that any melting of this could cause potential problems for infrastructure, such as buildings in cities and pipelines. ‘Projected changes in the permafrost seriously threaten the Russian economy, primarily due to the increased risk of damage to the infrastructure of the Far North,’ Professor Anisimov said. The US-based Natural Resources Defence Council said it is vital to pay attention to environmental changes at the top of the world. ‘The Arctic is global warming’s canary in the coal mine. Most scientists view what is happening now in the Arctic as a harbinger of things to come,’ the council said. Four new mysterious giant craters have appeared in the Siberian permafrost in northern Russia, sparking fears that global warming may be causing gas to erupt from underground. Scientists spotted the new holes, along with dozens of other smaller ones, in the same area as three other enormous craters that were spotted on the Yamal Peninsula last year. The craters are thought to be caused by eruptions of methane gas from the permafrost as rising rising temperatures causes the frozen soil to melt. It has sparked fears that the craters could become more common as climate change continues to warm and led to warnings that the area is facing a looming natural disaster. Unexplained: The first of the new craters discovered, named B1 (pictured above), shows signs of an huge eruption of gas. Four new mysterious giant craters have appeared in the Siberian permafrost in northern Russia, sparking fears that global warming may be causing gas to erupt from underground . One of new craters, surrounded by at least 20 smaller holes, is just six miles from a major gas production plant. Experts have predicted there could be up to 30 more are waiting to be discovered. Scientists, however, are still largely baffled by the exact processes causing the craters. Professor Vasily Bogoyavlensky, deputy director of the Moscow-based Oil and Gas Research Institute, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has called for 'urgent' investigation of the new phenomenon amid safety fears. Until now, the existence of only three Siberian craters had been established when great caverns in the frozen landscape were spotted by passing helicopter pilots. 'We know now of seven craters in the Arctic area,' Professor Bogoyavlensky told The Siberian Times. 'Five are directly on the Yamal peninsula, one in Yamal Autonomous district, and one is on the north of the Krasnoyarsk region, near the Taimyr peninsula. 'We have exact locations for only four of them. The other three were spotted by reindeer herders. 'But I am sure that there are more craters on Yamal, we just need to search for them. I would compare this with mushrooms. 'When you find one mushroom, be sure there are few more around. I suppose there could be 20 to 30 craters more.' Two of the newly-discovered large craters - also known as funnels to scientists - have turned into lakes, revealed Professor Bogoyavlensky. 'It is important not to scare people, but this is a very serious problem. We must research this phenomenon urgently to prevent possible disasters. 'We cannot rule out new gas emissions in the Arctic and in some cases they can ignite.'","Professor Oleg Anisimov said Arctic temperatures are rising fast .

"Victim: Jon-Jo Highton, 18, suffered horrific injuries after one of his attackers shouted ‘That’s him!’ and he was set upon by a gang, a jury was told . A teenager was hacked to death in the street near his home by eight men who jumped out of two cars and launched a brutal revenge attack, a court heard yesterday. Jon-Jo Highton, 18, suffered horrific injuries after one of his attackers shouted ‘That’s him!’ before the group began slashing at him, a jury was told. His mother fled the court in tears as the jury was shown a computerised image showing the horrific injury to the side of the head which the prosecution say was the fatal blow. The shocking attack in a street in Preston, Lancashire stemmed from rivalry between groups of drug-dealers but had been provoked by a violent incident hours earlier at the home of one of the alleged killers, the court heard. Member of the group which set upon the father-of-one had earlier been storing axes, knives, hammers and a sword, telling people they were ‘in case the enemy rolls on us’, the jury was told. ‘We are not able to say which of the defendants struck the fatal blow, but what we do say is that each of the defendants charged on count one is guilty of the offence of murder because he participated in the attack on Jon-Jo Highton and he did so with murderous intent,’ Neil Flewitt, QC, prosecuting, told the jury at Preston Crown Court. He said Jon-Jo had been killed by being struck on the side of the face by a long-bladed weapon ‘with considerable force’, severing his jugular vein and carotid artery, but suffered numerous other wounds as well. He said the jury would hear the attack had been launched in revenge for an incident in the early hours of that morning, August 23 last year, at 19-year-old Owen Whitesmith’s home in which a friend of his mother was headbutted. Mr Flewitt said the jury would hear that Whitesmith had been storing weapons including a sword in the flat of a girl he had been dealing heroin only for them to be moved a week before the killing. He said Jon-Jo's group and Whitesmith's associates were rival drug dealers and that there was 'a background of hostility' between them. In the day following the headbutt attack, ‎another witness told police Whitesmith had been ‎'trying to get some lads together in revenge', Mr Flewitt said. The jury was told Whitesmith referred to friends as 'G' in texts, meaning 'gangster', Mr Flewitt said. Among those they recruited was 23-year-old Arran Graham, known as 'Scottish'. In one text, the jury was told Whitesmith asked him: '‎Are you going to come and do something with me today because all the boys are pussies?' Graham allegedly replied: 'Come and get me bro.' Mr Flewitt said Graham later sent Whitesmith a text message asking 'What soldiers have we got?' to which he answered 'L's bro and big weapons'. Preston Crown Court: The attack in a street in the Lancashire town stemmed from rivalry drug-dealers but had been provoked by a violent incident hours earlier at the home of one of the alleged killers, the court heard . Flanked by security guards in the glass-panelled dock, Graham appeared to smirk and exchanged glances to a smiling co-defendant ‎as the prosecution case against them was outlined. Another was Craig Walton, 26, who according to visitors to his flat had a large machete-type weapon and a stick with a spike taped to one end to defend his drugs if someone tried to steal them, Mr Flewitt said. Mr Flewitt said the quartet, joined by 24-year-old Stephen Walton (no relation) drove towards Jon-Jo's home in the Deepdale area in Whitesmith’s blue Vauxhall Vectra at about 10.30pm that day, keeping in touch with three further men in a second car, a Vauxhall Meriva. At about 11.15pm, he said, the jury would hear that 20-year-old drug dealer Zaahid Patel, who was in the second car, spotted Jon-Jo - who had just left a pub near his home where he was playing pool - and shouted 'That's him!' and called Whitesmith‎. 'It is the prosecution case that the purpose of the call was for Zaahid Patel to let Owen Whitesmith know that he had spotted Jon-Jo Highton,' he added. Moments later, Jon-Jo was attacked with fatal consequences. Whitesmith, Graham, Patel, Craig Walton, Minhaj Musa, 21, Mohammed Sabaar Dal, 20, all of Preston, Joshua Bore, 19, of Ribbleton, and Stephen Walton, of no fixed address, all deny murder. Liam Tunstall, 26, of Penwortham, Stuart Eastham, 32, of Ribbleton, and John Wilding, 36, of Darwen, all deny assisting an offender. The trial continues.

"A young mother-of-two has refused NHS cancer treatment and is trying to cure herself with herbal remedies and a raw food diet instead. Kelly Logan, from Dagenham, Essex, was diagnosed with breast cancer just five months ago after finding a lump in her chest. The 34-year-old was devastated when doctors told her she needed emergency surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy to give her the best chance of survival. But to the horror of her doctors - and initially her family - she has defiantly refused all medical treatment, opting to eat raw vegetables and take vitamin supplements  in a bid to prolong her life. Kelly Logan, 34, was diagnosed with breast cancer but has refused medical treatment, as she says chemotherapy would leave her unable to care for children Logan, 14, and Blaze, 4 . Ms Logan was told she needed surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But she refused these treatments, opting to eat a diet of raw vegetables - with no fish or meat - and take vitamins and herbal remedies instead . Ms Logan said she has always been against invasive medical treatments, and believes doctors are 'biased' towards them. She is pictured, left, before she became ill and, right, after her diagnosis . Ms Logan said: 'I don't want to lose my breast and be pumped full of chemotherapy. 'People have called me selfish because I'm refusing all treatment provided on the NHS but if anything, having the treatment is selfish. 'I wouldn't be able to do anything with my eldest son, Logan, who is 14, and my youngest son, Blaze, who is just four, if I was being sick and feeling tired all the time. 'Thanks to my new eating and exercising regime, I now feel healthier than ever. 'Being diagnosed with breast cancer at such a young age is heartbreaking but I was more petrified of chemotherapy than I was about the cancer. 'I felt doctors were biased towards conventional treatment.' Ms Logan has always been against chemotherapy and invasive treatments that aim to cure cancer. Ms Logan takes around 20 vitamins a day as well as herbal remedies, which she claims shore up her immune system. She also exercises as often as she can . Professor Peter Johnson, medical oncologist and chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, warned if left untreated, Ms Logan’s cancer is likely to spread around her body. He told MailOnline: ‘I completely understand that someone who has just been told they have cancer might be scared and worried - and might seek alternative treatments. ‘But this is a very risky strategy. ‘Cancer Research UK spends millions carrying out clinical trials to ensure the advice doctors give to patients about cancer is evidence-based. ‘There simply isn’t any reliable evidence for alternative approaches. ‘Sometimes we see spontaneous remissions, which are put down to alternative therapies, but no clinical trial has ever showed them to be effective.' He added: ‘If I was getting on an aeroplane to travel across the Atlantic, I would want to get on the plane with someone who was trained, knew what they were doing, and had looked at the evidence. 'Not with someone without a licence who vaguely thought there was a chance they could fly a plane. 'There is simply no evidence diet changes and vitamins can treat cancer. ‘One of the reasons breast cancer deaths have come down in recent years is because we have effective treatments in the form of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. ‘If people don’t take those treatments they have to realise they are putting their lives at risk. ‘Breast cancer spreads into the breasts, into the chest wall, into the lymph nodes and into the blood stream and around the body. ‘It’s likely if this lady isn’t treated her cancer will spread around her body. That’s what usually happens. ‘She has a high chance of cure with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It would be a real shame for her to miss out on this.’ She said: 'One of my friends had cancer but he died while having chemo as his immune system became so low. 'Also, the thought of losing my hair terrified me as well, I didn't want to look like a cancer sufferer. 'Doctors told me I needed to lose my whole right breast and that chemo would stop it from spreading. 'I decided to research alternative treatments online and that's when I found out about the different herbal remedies you can take to help your body. 'I no longer eat meat or fish and live off a 90 per cent raw vegetable diet so I eat a lot of vegetables and fruit juices.' However, experts warn there is no evidence alternative therapies can cure cancer, stop its spread or slow tumour growth. Sue Green, senior information development nurse at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: 'Using herbal remedies instead of traditional cancer treatment is considered a form of alternative therapy. 'Alternative therapies are used instead of conventional cancer treatments. They are different from complementary therapies. 'No alternative therapies have ever been proven to cure cancer or slow its growth and Macmillan Cancer Support does not advocate the use of them. 'For anyone considering, or currently having, alternative therapy it is important to tell your doctor as soon as possible.' But Ms Logan believes chemotherapy would ruin her quality of life, and alternative therapies will allow her to live longer. She said: 'I don't allow cancer to rule my day to day life but I like to see if my self-healing is working to halt the growth of my lump. 'I work 50-hours a week, I support two young children and I exercise as often as I can.' She monitors the size of the lump on her breast by drawing two black dots onto it every day. Her family were devastated when she told them she was going to refuse all treatment, but . She said: 'My mum was really upset but once I showed her my research and what I hoped to do, she understood and accepted my decision. 'My breast cancer is ductal carcinoma and doctors think it's linked to an infection I caught during breastfeeding in my milk duct which caused the mutation of cells to grow.' Ms Logan has an ultrasound on her breast every three months but doesn't plan to accept treatment even if her cancer starts to grow rapidly. Ms Logan, pictured with her youngest son Blaze, four, before she was diagnosed, says she will carry on treating herself with alternative therapies even if scans show her cancer tumour has grown . She said: 'On my last check-up in January they told me that my lump at grown 0.9mm, which is such a tiny amount considering how long I have had the tumour for. 'I have asked for an MRI but my doctor knows that even if my cancer had spread that I wouldn't want chemotherapy so there's no point in finding out.' She says feels that she's taking her life into her own hands and wants others to do the same. She added: 'I feel better than I ever have, people always say I look great considering I have cancer but it's because I haven't been pumped with drugs. 'I take about 20 different vitamins to help keep up my immune system. 'I'm not looking for a miracle cure but I feel I can keep my life as normal by following my own detoxing treatment plan. 'I haven't asked doctors how long I will live without treatment but I'm confident it will be longer than if I had conventional treatment. Ms Logan has even set up a blog to document her journey and is writing an eBook in a bid to provide others with diet tips and herbal remedies that combat cancer. She said: 'I know not everyone will agree with my choice of self-healing but there are lots of people who do and it's amazing how much support I have had from complete strangers. 'I hope my story gives others the strength to make their own cancer treatment decisions based on what they want rather than what doctors feel is best.'

"Brigitte Bardot's animal rights charity has offered to help send two alcoholic Russian bears to rehab after they became addicted to beer because customers were allowed to buy them drinks. A court ordered the bears to be confiscated from the restaurant in Sochi, in south-western Russia's Krasnodar Krai region, after they were found lying in a filthy cage surrounded by rubbish. But Russian zoos refused to take the bears on because of their addiction, which made them bad tempered. Finally, British animal welfare organisation Big Hearts Foundation stepped forward and with backing from the Brigitte Bardot Fund it is hoped the bears will soon be on their way to a bear park in Romania which will treat them for their addiction. The two alcoholic bears were confiscated from a restaurant in the city of Sochi, Russia, after they were found lying in this filthy cage (pictured) surrounded by rubbish. Patrons regularly bought them beer for 'fun' The alcoholic bears are believed to have lived in the squalid cage at the back of a restaurant for 20 years . The restaurant owner, Dzheniks Uzaroshvili, has rejected the suggestion that it was cruel to give the bears alcohol, and said: 'Beer is good for the bears because of the Sochi climate.' The court heard the bears often had a spotlight unexpectedly shone on them on them as people laughed at their reaction. According to evidence given in court the spotlight was the reason one of the bears was virtually blind. Anna Kogan, from the British Big Hearts Foundation, said that the bears had been served alcohol to entertain guests in a cage at the back of the restaurant for around 20 years. A British animal charity became involved in re-homing the bears after zoos refused to take them on . Dzheniks Uzaroshvili (pictured) the restaurant owner, denied it was cruel to give the bears alcohol . Alcoholic bears suffer in the same way as humans including unpredictable tempers and withdrawal symptoms . The alcoholic bears, which are currently going cold turkey, will now be moved to a huge Bear Park in Romania . Ms Kogan said: 'The problem is that they are alcoholics, and it is even more difficult to wean bears off alcohol than is with human beings.' Experts said that alcoholic bears suffer all the same problems that humans do, including unpredictable tempers and the withdrawal symptoms that a human being might expect. Vets say with proper care the bears will be able to beat their addiction, . After a lengthy appeal the British charity won backing from the Brigitte Bardot foundation and a new home has now been found. Prosecutors decided to confiscate the bears after 500 activists protested outside the restaurant in 2012 . The alcoholic bears, which are currently going cold turkey, will now be moved to a huge Bear Park in Romania. But first they must be confiscated from the restaurant, where they remain, and moved to the Romanian port of Constanta by funds paid for by the Brigitte Bardot foundation. They will then be sent to the Bear Park in central Transylvania, just 20 miles from the city of Brasov. The sanctuary has offered to re-home the bears and provide them with treatment for their alcohol problems. However, Ms Kogan says they are still looking for a company to transport the bears - which they cannot do until the Russian authorities act on the court order and confiscate them. She said today: 'The bears are still with the restaurant owner. 'The Ministry of Natural Resources, which is the body that has to take them away, is taking their time with acting on this decision as there is no where in Sochi to put them temporarily. 'There is a home for these bears in a rehabilitation centre in Romania. 'Big Hearts Foundation and others are happy to organise the move when the authorities start cooperating with us on document preparation and veterinary assessments of the animals.' The sanctuary is home to around 70 bears who have been mistreated and have spent years in captivity. Prosecutors decided to confiscate the bears after 500 activists protested outside the restaurant in 2012.

"When John Travolta planted an awkward kiss on an unwitting Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars on Sunday evening, the surrounding paparazzi swiftly captured the fist-gnawingly awful moment in its full glory. Scarlett's icy stare spoke volumes as John snaked an arm around her svelte waist and brushed his lips against her cheek, and promptly sent the Twittersphere into a frenzy of Travolta-related memes. But it seems the Hollywood actor isn't the only one guilty of mistiming a smooch. We've found a whole raft of  celebrities who lunged in for a kiss and ended up on a collision course with embarrassment. Here's our pick of the best...plus a guide to how you can get it right. Scroll down for video . Scarlett Johansson looks distinctly unimpressed as John Travolta leans in for a surprise kiss at the 87th Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday evening . Successfully puckering up in public is always a minefield...it's difficult to create chemistry with a hundred flashbulbs pointing in your direction. Recent kissing fails include supermodel Naomi Campbell, who struggled to get to grips with Sarah Ferguson during the Fashion For Relief Show, at London Fashion Week. And pop mogul Simon Cowell seems to struggle with all of his paramours. Simon and girlfriend Lauren  were captured in an uncomfortable embrace at the Elle Style Awards in London this week while an appearance on the Jay Leno Show in 2010 with then fiancée Mezhgan Hussainy attracted plenty of ridicule.

Kiss of life? Sandra Bullock (right) famously embraced Meryl Streep at the Critics' Choice Movie Awards  at the Hollywood Palladium in 2010...but it looks more like she's attempting resuscitation . So, what are the golden rules when it comes to clinches? How do you avoid clashing teeth, bruising chins or bruising noses? Etiquette consultant William Hanson says the trick is letting a woman guide the situation. He says: 'In social situations, a man should take the lead from the woman as to how they will greet. 'Sadly women don't know now that they need to make the first move, as it were. If the woman extends her hand then that means the pair will shake hands. If she opens her arms wide, there will be a hug, and so on.' It's hard enough for couples who are comfortable in each others' presence but greeting an acquaintance can also throw up squirming situations. William adds that: 'Two kisses is now the norm in the UK and Europe, although older British generations will just kiss once (cheek to cheek - never lips on cheek!).' He adds: 'While across the pond in America social kissing is not as popular although it is seen more in New York and LA. And if you get stuck - simple extend a hand and forget the kiss altogether.' Political mishaps: The Obamas (left) usually have great chemistry but this kiss falls short of the mark and (right) Labour leader Ed Miliband tries to wave and kiss at the same time...with dismal consequences .

"It’s well known that Isis are violently anti-Western – but not, it seems, when it comes to fast food. In the terrorist group’s Iraqi stronghold of Mosul it’s possible to eat US-style burgers and fries, courtesy of a burger joint. ‘Big Burger’, which can be found in the north of the city by the Tigris River, in the Elarabi Quarter, serves a variety of meals. In Isis' stronghold of Mosul, it's possible to by a Western-style cheeseburger at a Big Burger joint . Super-sized: Big Burger offers its customers the option of having large fries, just as fast food restaurants in the West do . ‘Big Burger’, which can be found in the north of the city by the Tigris River, in the Elarabi Quarter, lets its customers eat inside, or al fresco . It’s possible to order a chicken sandwich, cheeseburger and Mexican-style fillings, as well as Western soft drinks such as Sprite and Coca-Cola. Customers can eat their meals al fresco, or inside, on tablecloths adorned with the words 'fast food', in English. The restaurant appears to be very popular, with an average score of 4.2 out of five from 201 reviews on its Facebook page, which has nearly 3,000 ‘likes’. The fact that the terrorists allow the restaurant to operate may surprise some. The group mete out extreme punishments to people who embrace Western habits, even executing those they deem to have strayed from their strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. Earlier this year, for instance, 13 teenage boys were shot dead for watching the Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan last week. Isis declared that they'd broken religious law by watching the game. And this week it emerged that Isis terrorists have blown up the Mosul Public Library, sending 10,000 books and more than 700 rare manuscripts up in flames. Leading members of Mosul society reportedly tried to stop the fanatics destroying the building, but failed. The director of the library, Ghanim al-Ta'an, said that the extremists used homemade bombs in the attack, which took place on Sunday. He told Middle Eastern website Geran: 'ISIS militants bombed the Mosul Public Library. They used improvised explosive devices.' The restaurant appears to be very popular, with an average score of 4.2 out of five from 201 reviews on its Facebook page, which has nearly 3,000 ‘likes’ Presumed destroyed are the Central Library's collection of Iraqi newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire and book collections contributed by around 100 of Mosul's establishment families. Mosul blogger Rayan al-Hadidi, according to The Fiscal Times, said: 'Nine hundred years ago, the books of the Arab philosopher Averroes were collected before his eyes... and burned. One of his students started crying while witnessing the burning. Averroes told him... the ideas have wings... but I cry today over our situation.' Isis first invaded the Central Library in January. Residents say the extremists smashed the locks that had protected the biggest repository of learning in the northern Iraq town, and loaded around 2,000 books — including children's stories, poetry, philosophy and tomes on sports, health, culture and science — into six pickup trucks. They left only Islamic texts. 'These books promote infidelity and call for disobeying Allah. So they will be burned,' a bearded militant in traditional Afghani two-piece clothing told residents, according to one man living nearby who spoke to The Associated Press. The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation, said the Islamic State group official made his impromptu address as others stuffed books into empty flour bags.","'Big Burger' in Isis' strong-hold of Mosul sells Western-style fast food .

"A former Knox Grammar teacher and convicted sex offender who took the stand on Tuesday at the royal commission into child sexual abuse said he was not fired when the school learned of his abuse. Craig Treloar, a former teacher at the elite boy's school, told the inquest he expected to be fired when he was caught, but was instead shown leniency, the ABC reported. He engaged in sexual abuse with young male students at the school, as well as showing them pornographic images with some depicting bestiality. Treloar - who was convicted on a number of charges including sexual abuse in 2010 -  told the commission he expected to be sacked by the then principal Dr Ian Paterson after he admitted to showing students porn in 1987, but he was not reprimanded. Scroll down for video . Craig Treloar, a former teacher and convicted sex offender told an inquest on Tuesday he was not fired as he though he would be when he confessed to showing students pornography in 1987 . 'I thought my career was over,' he told the hearing. 'I thought I'd be sacked.' 'The decision was that obviously I would leave the boarding house, that I would lose my teaching position for a period of six months,' Treloar said. But according to the former teacher he was never asked about the extent of the abuse, and after being told he was to lose his paid teaching position for a period, did not even have to serve that time immediately. There was no mention of either an internal inquiry or involving the police. The hearing continues. Former Knox Grammar School student Scott Ashton, told a royal commission hearing investigating how the Uniting Church and the private school responded to child abuse allegations, that he was left deeply confused by the tribute to the late Bruce Barrett . Earlier this week the inquiry was told the prestigious Sydney school erected memorial gates for a teacher who was known to be a 'notorious molester' with the inscription 'he touched us all'. Former Knox Grammar School student Scott Ashton, 44, told a royal commission hearing investigating how the Uniting Church and the private school responded to child abuse allegations, that he was left deeply confused by the tribute to the late Bruce Barrett. Mr Ashton called the art teacher a 'notorious molester' while giving evidence to the commission on Tuesday, as he revealed the abuse he had personally suffered at Barrett's hands in the Wahroonga school's classrooms on Sydney's North Shore. In his statement, read out by close friend Gretel Pinniger who is also known as the high profile Sydney dominatrix Madame Lash, Mr Ashton said Barrett would chase and tickle his students. Pictured: Counsel assisting the inquiry David Lloyd at the Royal Commission Into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse public hearing into Knox Grammar School, Sydney. Mr Ashton said he was inappropriately touched in sight of other staff and students in the playground . He told the inquiry that Barrett would occasionally wear a red tie, announcing 'watch out boys, it's a red tie day' to signify someone would be caned that day. On one occasion, he recalled being chased by the teacher who then requested he stay back after class. Fearing that he would be caned, Mr Ashton was instead sexually assaulted. 'I felt ashamed of my abuse. I was deeply ashamed and unable to discuss it with anyone,' Mr Ashton said in his statement, according to News Corp. 'It was an issue which I avoided because any reminder of it would cause me severe stress and interfered with my ability to function and cope on a day-to-day basis.'

On one occasion, Mr Ashton recalled being chased by the teacher who then requested he stay behind after class. Fearing that he would be caned, Mr Ashton was instead sexually assaulted . Despite his notoriety, Mr Ashton said everyone at the school was expected to pay tribute to Barrett, who had died young. 'The fact that he was so well regarded by the school despite being a notorious molester made me feel very confused and powerless,' he said. Mr Ashton said he was nine when he went to Knox and from the start he was abused 'openly and brazenly' by another teacher, Barrie Stewart. He said the sexual abuse he suffered led him to become a teenage sex worker, according to the ABC.

He described another incident in which he was inappropriately touched in sight of other staff and students in the playground, saying: 'It was so common I wasn't sure it was wrong for teachers to touch me like that.' In 2009, Stewart was convicted of five counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault. He was given a suspended sentence. Five former teachers have been convicted of sexual assault, however the inquiry has heard allegations against a further three staff members who have never been charged.

"A Massachusetts boy is heartbroken after the gifts he received at his birthday party were seemingly accidentally loaded into a different vehicle and disappeared. Presents in honor of Gage Desmond's fifth birthday have yet to show up, his mother Jessica Fratoni has said, despite her efforts to get them back. The boy's presents were reportedly lost Sunday.

'He cried yesterday because he was wondering where his gifts were.' She also told the newspaper 'I told him honestly. Nana's friend put them into the wrong car. 'And we don't know where they went. But he's not quite grasping that.' The Salem News reported that Fratoni reached out to the bowling alley, which in turn got in touch with different parties - and no one has come forward. She also reached out to police and asked for help on Facebook, according to the newspaper. Incident: The presents reportedly went missing after Gage's Sunday birthday party, which was held at Metro Bowl (file photo) Fratoni was quoted by Peabody Patch as saying on the social media website 'I’m trying to spread the word and pray someone is kind enough to return his stuff to either the Metro Bowl or the Peabody Police Department.' 'She said she used my key to unlock it,' Fratoni told the Salem News. 'I said, ""That doesn't happen."" You can't use the same key to unlock two cars. I'm guessing the car was already unlocked.' Fratoni told the newspaper 'It's hard to believe, that if someone finds the gifts in their car they won’t say, ""These had to be put there at the Metrobowl by mistake."" And they'll bring them back.” The boy's great-grandmother, Sandra Hopkins, also spoke to the news outlet, saying 'I'm waiting for the right time [to talk to the woman]. She wanted to be helpful.

"Thousands of over-55s will be unable to access new pension freedoms in April because there are still gaping holes in the Government’s policy, it is claimed. Britain’s insurers say neither they nor the Government will be ready when the radical reforms are introduced in just six weeks’ time. In a startling admission, the industry body for pensions firms say ‘critical pieces of the jigsaw’ will not be in place when the changes ‘go live’ on April 6. Chancellor George Osborne, pictured, announced last March that over-55s would be allowed to use their pension pots how they liked from this April, instead of being forced to buy an annuity . Last March, Chancellor George Osborne made the surprise announcement that over-55s would be able to withdraw their pension and spend it as they wished, rather than being forced to buy an annuity. It followed criticism that annuities, a guaranteed income for life, had become poor value for money. Under the plans, people should be able to dip into their pension whenever they like, with 25 per cent of any withdrawal tax-free. But the Association of British Insurers will use its annual conference today to say missing details mean it is ‘impossible’ to say the new freedoms will be available on time. The ABI pointed out that the Government’s guidance service, which offers free information on the reforms, still had no phone number just 40 days before the rules change, meaning there is nowhere for pension providers to direct people to if they did not have internet access. Insurers also have little information on how the guidance, called Pension Wise, will work and how consultations will be logged so insurers know what had been discussed with customers. Pensions expert Dr Ros Altman, pictured, feared some pension firms would not allow customers to switch to a flexible income drawdown scheme . Providers are also still waiting for ‘critical rules’ from the Financial Conduct Authority on what information they must give to customers before allowing them to withdraw their cash. But critics have also accused insurers themselves of ‘dragging their feet’ and failing to adapt to the reforms quickly enough. Pensions’ expert and government advisor Ros Altmann, said: ‘The fact that Pension Wise is not yet fully operational should not stop pension firms from helping their customers to benefit from the freedoms. ‘Some firms are moving with the times whereas too many others are just staying with the status quo which has suited them so well for so long but has not necessarily been in customer interests.’ The uncertainty will raise fresh doubts over how many people will actually be able to use their pension like a bank account, as has been suggested by ministers. Dr Altmann said she feared many pension firms would not allow their customers to switch to a flexible income drawdown schemes, forcing customers to move. Millions are stuck in older schemes that will not let them swap. These savers may incur exit fees worth up to a fifth of their pension pot if they move to a more flexible company. Others will be forced to wait while their provider decides if it will accommodate the reforms. Many pension firms have already admitted they will not make the changes by April, if at all. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘We have already seen firms announce new products for April 2015, launched the first arm of the guidance service – the Pension Wise website – and are on course to meet demand for face to face and telephone guidance in April.’","George Osborne announced major pension rule changes last March .

"A global report last night made a blistering attack on the UK Government for its ‘evasion, denial and delays’ over establishing the truth about Britain’s complicity in torture. There had been ‘no significant progress in holding those responsible to account’, said the group, which had reviewed human-rights abuses around the world. In December, a US Senate intelligence committee revealed the most gruesome detail about the CIA’s torture programme, which included subjecting detainees at a network of secret jails to beatings, waterboarding, sleep deprivation and other forms of torture. A detainee is escorted to an interrogation room at the Camp Delta detention facility at the U.S. Marine Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which was linked to a network of secret jails where inmates were abused . Those detained included more than a dozen British residents, among them Shaker Aamer, 48, a father of four whose family live in South London. He has been held in Guantanamo Bay for 13 years without charge or trial. Many of the detainees have claimed they were ill-treated with the knowledge of British agents. MPs and campaign groups have insisted a judge-led investigation is needed to establish exactly what Britain knew – and if it fed questions to the CIA to ask the detainees. But the Government has insisted that a probe by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) will suffice. This is despite the fact the ISC has already cleared the UK of complicity in torture before, in a 2007 ruling. Critics say the ISC does not have the powers to uncover the extent of the involvement and knowledge of the security and intelligence agencies and what former Labour ministers – including Tony Blair, Jack Straw and David Miliband – knew. And yesterday it was thrown into further disarray by the resignation of chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind over the cash-for-access affair. The Amnesty report says: ‘Several [European countries] hosted secret detention sites – Poland, Lithuania and Romania – or otherwise assisted the US government in the illegal transfer, enforced disappearance and torture and other ill-treatment of dozens of detainees, including in particular the UK, Sweden, Macedonia and Italy. ‘In none of these countries was there any significant progress in holding those responsible to account… Accountability continued to be undermined by evasion, denial and delays.’ Before capture: Shaker Aamer, 48,  pictured with two of his children. After 13 years in Guantanamo he has been cleared for release but US officials are determined that he is sent not to Britain but to Saudi Arabia . Amnesty says that the UK ‘talks the talk on the global stage on human rights but this year’s summary shows they need to tend to their own garden’. Its report heaps further pressure on the Government over the ongoing scandal of Mr Aamer’s imprisonment. Condemning official ‘evasion, denial and delays’ over Britain’s complicity in torture during the Blair years, Amnesty International’s blistering report brings deep shame on our country. Meanwhile, more than a dozen British residents languish in prison camps without trial – including Shaker Aamer, who has been held in Guantanamo Bay for 13 years. Only when they are given justice, and the nation is told the truth about torture, can we begin to lift the stain. Barack Obama last month promised David Cameron he would free Mr Aamer but so far no action has been taken. He has been cleared for release but US officials are determined that he is sent not to Britain but to Saudi Arabia, despite serious concerns he could face torture there. Other criticisms of the UK by Amnesty are likely to prove politically controversial, including an attack on new laws introduced in the UK to give the police and security services access to telephone records and electronic surveillance. Amnesty International UK director Kate Allen said: ‘We should all be concerned about waking up in a surveillance state without having a proper public debate about it first.’ The report also calls for the five permanent members of the UN Security Council – Russia, France, US, China and Britain – to renounce their veto rights in cases of genocide and other mass atrocities. It comes after the threat of the veto being exercised led to a failure by the UN to agree resolutions in Syria, Iraq, Gaza, Israel and Ukraine, despite ‘horrific crimes being committed against civilians by states or by armed groups’.","Amnesty International accuses UK of hypocrisy over human rights stance .

"After setting out over four months ago, the first cargo train to travel on the longest rail route in the world has returned home. On November 18, the train departed Yiwu in eastern China, a major wholesale centre for small consumer goods,  and passed through Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, France and finally Spain. The entire round-trip is approximately 16,000 miles on the new Yixin'ou cargo line, which ends in the Spanish capital Madrid. The train has returned to China after travelling on the world's longest route to Spain . The newly railway route is the longest in the world, longer still than Russia's famous Transsiberian railwa,y linking Moscow to Vladivostok, near Russia's border with China. The train's 82 shipping containers transported goods made in Zhejiang province, including spinning tops for children and cutting tools. The train returned to China with wine, olive oil and cured ham. Speaking at a ceremony when the train arrived in Madrid, Li Qiang, the governor of China's Zhejiang province where Yiwu is located, said the route was important to 'implement the strategy of developing a new 'silk road'. China has a regular direct freight train service to Germany, Europe's largest economy. Chinese officials are hoping the train route to Spain can stimulate a new economic prosperity . One route links the Chinese megacity of Chongqing to Duisburg, a steel-making town and one of Germany's most-important transportation and commercial hubs. The other route links Beijing, the Chinese capital, to Hamburg, Germany's second-largest city. The plan is to create a similar regular route between China and Spain, Spanish Public Works Minister Ana Pastor told reporters after the train arrived at a logistical centre near Madrid's main railway station. The Spanish capital already is 'a European and international distribution hub' with good links to both Africa and Latin America, she said. Following the successful journey from Yiwu, China to Madrid, Spain, it is hoped a new 'silk road' can establish trade relations . Euro Cargo Rail, a subsidiary of German freight operator DB Shenker Rail, is studying the possibility of starting a regular service between China and Spain during the first half of next year with two monthly trips. Roughly 80 percent of global trade is shipped by boat as freight train service faces several technical and bureaucratic hurdles which vary according to country. The goods on the train which arrived in Madrid for example had to be transferred to different wagons at three points during the trip because of incompatible track gauges in different countries. But rail transport is less expensive, more environmentally friendly and faster than maritime shipping, according to DB Shenker Rail. China is the European Union's biggest source of imports, according to the European Commission.","Train set out from Yiwu in eastern China back in November last year .

"Meagen Collins and Tom Williams have quite the enviable lifestyle. Two years ago, the couple from Brisbane decided to leave their menial jobs behind, withdraw their mortage deposit and pack up their life to travel the world. Since then they've travelled to 23 countries on a budget of about $AUS29 per person, per day and they have no regrets. The pair spoke to Daily Mail Australia as they sat on one of the beaches of The Algarve coast, southern Portugal, sharing their memorable moments and some tips for ways to travel cheap. Scroll down for video . Meagen Collins and Tom Williams have been travelling the world for two years. Mr Williams is pictured standing on the sand dunes of the Gobi Desert, Mongolia .

The couple enjoy a picnic at the Eiffel tower, Paris for $3 per person (left) and pose at the Taj Mahal, India (right) As they began to approach their 30s, Meagen and Tom - who like to call themselves Megsy and Tommo - began saving for a house in the Gold Coast two years ago, eventually amassing $35,000 for a deposit. 'We had decided to settle down and get a mortgage... then we realised that buying into the debt culture was not going to make us happy,' Mr Williams told Daily Mail Australia. 'We continued saving and then set out to travel forever and build an online income so we could discover a life of travel freedom.' Ms Collins was a travel agent and Mr Williams was a wedding singer. 'I used to sit in an office 60 hours a week and was too tired to do much more than sleep afterwards,' Ms Collins said. 'It was all work and no life. I could look back on a year and only remember a few key events. Repetitive routine was essentially robbing me of life memories. I don't have that problem now I have a travel freedom lifestyle.' The pair sit on the feet of one of the giant Buddhas at the UNESCO listed Yungang Grottoes in Datong, China . The happy couple enjoy the winter sunshine on a beach in Portugal . The couple also fund their full time travels through their travel blog and postcast '5 Dollar Planet' The couple are able to fund their travels through their travel blog and podcast '5 Dollar Planet', which aims to teach others how to discover travel freedom for themselves. 'We also get a lot of tours and products for free as successful bloggers,' Mr Williams said. 'Our podcast 5 Dollar Planet, which is about travel hacking and earning money online, gets sponsorship.' The pair have had to travel on a tight budget - calculating about $29 per person, per day - using simple methods to save money. They include house-sitting for free accommodation, travelling off season and steering clear of tourist restaurants by dining at places that are popular among locals. The couple have also embraced minimalism and carry 12kg of luggage each. 'We have zero regrets leaving our stuff,' Mr Williams said. 'Materialism doesn't make us happy, social interactions, experiences and memories do. I don't remember my toaster, but I will remember crossing the Gobi Desert in Mongolia for the rest of my life. Plus, other people around the world have toasters, I don't need my own.' Ms Collins stands one of the sandstone cliffs of the Algarve, Portugal . The couple pictured dancing on the back of a moving truck while being sprayed by a fire hose at the Thingyan Water Festival on the streets of Yangon, Burma . Ms Collins with one of the dogs she is pet sitting during her stay in Albufeira, Portugal . If there's one thing they miss, it's the Aussies. 'We have both been on the road in one form or another for so long its hard to associate with having a home anymore,' Mr Williams said. 'Mainly we miss family and friends and the Aussie people. You can't beat an Aussie BBQ on the beach and we are lucky to have met plenty of other Aussie travellers all around the world from Shanghai to Kosovo - we are always guaranteed a fun night when we do.' While the couple are house-sitting a cottage near the water as they soak up the sunshine in Portugal, next month they will be heading to Morocco. 'You can get a nice apartment for under $300 a month and enjoy the colorful and vibrant culture - and learn some more French!' Mr Williams said. And they have no intention of settling down back in Australia. 'We want to visit soon, though the cost of living is so high we are unlikely to return permanently,' Mr Williams said. The couple have also share some of their travel tips in their free book '5 Steps to Kickstarting Your Dream Lifestyle ', which is available online.","In 2013 couple Meagen Collins and Tom Williams packed up their lives in Brisbane to travel around the world .

"Goalkeeper Hope Solo has maintained she was the victim of domestic violence following a brawl at a family event - and not the aggressor, as police initially said - in her first interview since the incident last year. The 33-year-old athlete admitted however that it was 'stupid' of her to get into a U.S. Soccer van last month after a night out with her husband, who was charged with driving under the influence, resulting in Solo being banned from the game for 30 days. Solo was charged with two counts of domestic violence assault in June last year a family party in Washington state, following an altercation with her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew, who weighs 280lbs and stands 6ft 9in, however the charges were later dropped. In a sit-down with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America on Wednesday, Solo said that she was assaulted by her nephew. Scroll down for video . 'I was the victim': Despite police claiming she was the aggressor, Hope Solo has said her nephew assaulted her at a family function in Washington state last June, in which she was charged with assault . 'It was a horrible choice': Solo admitted to Robin Roberts on Wednesday that her actions during a traffic stop in California last month - which lead to a 30-day suspension - were 'stupid' 'I am very grateful U.S. Soccer let due process play itself out': Solo is grateful to have been reinstated . 'It's still very difficult for me to talk about,' Solo said in the GMA interview. 'I'm not going to go into all the details. 'I was a victim of domestic violence, at the hands of my 17-year-old nephew, who is 6 foot 9 inches and 280 pounds. 'He struck me over the head and I was concussed pretty severely. 'It was a very scary night.' Solo's nephew and her half-sister were not charged in the fight, and they still maintain Solo was the aggressor. U.S. Soccer did not suspend her after the incident, however they did following the controversial traffic stop with her husband, former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens. In January the two were driving in southern California -  where Colo was in a training camp - when Stevans was pulled over in a U.S. soccer van and arrested on suspicion of drink driving. Solo was said to have become 'belligerent' with police during the stop and was almost arrested for disorderly conduct. U.S. Soccer subsequently suspended her for 30-days, which threw into doubt her chances to play in next month's Alagrve Cup in Portugal. However Solo was reinstated last week. 'Well, clearly, I wasn't thinking,' Solo said Wednesday of the incident. 'I mean, it was a horrible choice . 'I think I just wasn't in a good place, emotionally, to even make good decisions. 'I mean, it's not an excuse but I just, it was stupid. 'I should've called a taxi.' She's back: U.S. starting goalkeeper Hope Solo was reinstated after a formal review by U.S. Soccer. She missed two games during her 30-day suspension following her husband's arrest on drunken driving charges . Troubled: Solo was suspended  after her husband, former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens, was arrested in Southern California on suspicion of driving under the influence in a U.S. team van . Solo thanked U.S. Soccer for reinstating her and seeing her through the controversy. 'All of us, in my opinion, have a fundamental right to be considered innocent until proven guilty,' she said. 'I know U.S. Soccer took a lot of heat. 'But I am very grateful that they let due process play itself out. 'Those eight months were some of the worst months of my entire life.' U.S. women's national team coach Jill Ellis announced Solo's inclusion on the Algarve Cup 25-player travel roster on Saturday. The United States, playing in its 20th Algarve Cup, opens with Norway. Solo has posted inspirational messages from fans on social media during her absence, and cheered on the national team in exhibition games in Europe. The United States fell 2-0 against France before beating England 1-0 with goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris starting in both games. Solo's suspension came at a critical time for the U.S. team, which is preparing for the Women's World Cup this summer in Canada. 'The situation warranted a consequence, and we thought it was reasonable,' Ellis said about Solo before the team traveled to Europe. 'This is important for us to be able to focus the players that we have on these games and then allow Hope some time to sort of reflect on some things.' The goalkeeper was dismissed in January from training camp in Southern California, where the team was preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June . Hope Solo was in the car when her husband Jerramy Stevens, pictured together in 2013, was arrested for drunk driving last month . It was the latest off-field trouble for the 33-year-old Olympian, considered one of the best goalkeepers in the women's game. Earlier this year, a judge dismissed two misdemeanor counts of domestic violence against her. Jerramy Stevens, a former Seattle Seahawks tight end, was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence in Manhattan Beach, California . Solo had pleaded not guilty in that case and she continued to play for the U.S. team and with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Seattle Reign, while awaiting trial. Her last appearance in a match with the national team was in December, when she started in a scoreless draw against Brazil in the championship game of the 2014 International Tournament of Brasilia. In a statement released following her suspension, Solo said: 'I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.' A representative for Solo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. The Algarve roster also includes Christine Rampone (back), Megan Rapinoe (right knee), who were injured during the team's January training camp in Carson, California, and did not play the two matches in Europe. Newly married forward Sydney Leroux, who had been nursing a sore ankle, was also included. The U.S. women, currently ranked No. 2 in the world behind Germany, are seeking their third World Cup title, but first since 1991.","Solo, 33, claims her nephew, 17, assaulted her last year .

"A mother suffering from an often debilitating bowel disease has written a no-holds-barred open letter to the cruel bullies who have tutted at her for using disabled toilet facilities. Sam Cleasby, 33, from Sheffield, suffers from Ulcerative Colitis, which causes ulcers to form inside the digestive system. Despite her normal outward appearance, the mother-of-three can often be left in huge discomfort by bleeding, diarrhoea, and fatigue, symptoms made worse by unkind remarks from unwitting tormentors. Scroll down for video . Mum-of-three Sam Cleasby, 33, wrote an open letter addressing  her tormentors on her So Bass Ass blog. The post has received two million hits so far and hundreds of supportive comments - including apologies . Ms Cleasby wrote the emotionally-charged post entitled 'Dear lady who tutted at me using the disabled loos...' after she was left 'humiliated, angry and upset' by the reactions of other women when she used the disabled facility at a public bathroom. The post documenting the harrowing encounter has gone viral, attracting around two million hits and supportive comments - and even some apologies - from across the globe. Sam documents her story about living with the disease in her wittily-titled blog 'So Bad Ass'. She writes: 'When using disabled toilets, I’ve had women tutting at me, nudging their friends or loudly questioning why I am using the bathroom when I am not disabled.' Beating the bullies: Sam uses her online posts on her blog, So Bad Ass, to document living with bowel disease. The mum-of-three says she's delighted her 'open letter' has raised awareness . The open letter has had a huge impact: Sam says: 'I regret not calling out the women who judged me at the time, but my letter has turned these bad incidents into something has made a difference to millions.' She explains about what it's like to live with the condition before pouring scorn on those who've judged her: 'Having an invisible illness, such as Ulcerative Colitis, is a very isolating and embarrassing experience. 'I know you saw me running in, with my able bodied legs, my two working arms, without a wheelchair, without any visible sign of disability… and assumed I was showing guilt at blagging the disabled loos. The fact is that I have no bowel.' She adds: 'Last week a supermarket cleaner laughed as she heard me using the toilet and then called to her friend: “OH MY GOD! You should hear the noise in there!"" 'I was mortified, but more upset to know that my daughter, who was waiting outside heard her too.' Addressing the woman directly, she says: 'Perhaps you could have stopped and heard me sobbing with pain because the acid in my stools has no way to be neutralised because I don’t have a large intestine and so opening my bowels actually burns my skin.' No external signs: Sam feels she suffers more prejudice because people don't realise she has a disability. Her 'jpouch', which is similar to a colostomy bag, is often well hidden beneath her clothes . Sam has to wear a 'jpouch', an ileostomy bag (similar to a colostomy bag), after having her large colon removed. In a bid to raise awareness and help others suffering with the disease she has posed for scantily-clad images in a bid to break the taboo surrounding her illness. People with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, such as Ulcerative Colitis and Crohns disease have the right to use disabled toilets. She has since received messages from thousands of people, many with illnesses or disabilities that are not immediately seen telling their own horror stories at being judged unfairly by members of the public. But interestingly, Sam has also heard from some who admitted they had been the person doing the tutting. 'I have had a lot of apologies,' she says: 'People telling me they recognised themselves in my letter and would change their behaviour in future. That felt amazing, I regret not calling out the women who judged me at the time, but my letter has turned these bad incidents into something has made a difference to millions.' Dear lady who loudly tutted at me using the disabled loos, . I know you saw me running in, with my able bodied legs and all. You saw me opening the door with my two working arms. You saw me without a wheelchair. Without any visible sign of disability. You tutted loudly as I rattled the handle with my hands that work perfectly and my able voice call to my kids that I’d be out in just a minute. My lack of wheelchair may have suggested to you that I was some lazy cow who didn’t care. Some inconsiderate bitch who was using something I wasn’t entitled too. (I actually carry a card to explain that I’m entitled to and have a disability key if you’d have cared to ask). You may have seen my face blushing as I caught your eye and assumed I was showing guilt at blagging the disabled loos. Living with a disease that people can't see: Sam uses her blog to highlight body image issues for bowel disease sufferers . The fact is that I have no bowel. I have a pouch formed from my small intestine which can’t handle volume and so I have to go to the toilet and poo several times a day. My lack of large intestine means that my stool is totally liquid as I have no means of absorbing the fluids in food and so its really hard to hold it when I need to go. I sometimes have accidents which means a large toilet that has a sink right by me means I can clean myself up when things go awry. I hate having to use the disabled loos as I have to deal with people like you staring, nudging, tutting. And whenever I can, I use the ladies toilets. Just so you know, disabled loos usually smell bad and don’t seem to be cleaned as often or as well as the ladies and so I wouldn’t choose this option unless totally necessary. Whilst I’m at it, I’d like to address the cleaner in the supermarket ladies toilets I used this week. As I ran in, knees together, bursting through the door and running to the cubicle, I’m sorry that the noise of my (lack of) bowels made you burst out laughing. I can actually take the sniggering as since I had a pouch made from my small intestine because my disease ridden colon was removed during surgery, the noise I make when I defecate is hilariously loud. Seriously, I get it. It’s comedic in it’s volume. But before you ran outside the loos and called to your friend “OH MY GOD! You should hear the noise in there!!! I wouldn’t go in if I was you!!!!” Perhaps you could have noted my daughter who was waiting outside with our trolley because her mum had had to leave her stranded to run to the toilet. Perhaps you could have stopped and heard me sobbing with pain because the acid in my stools has no way to be neutralised because I don’t have a large intestine and so opening my bowels actually burns my skin. Perhaps you both could have shown a little empathy, a little compassion, a little understanding. Poo is funny. Disability is confusing. I get that. But humanity and care for fellow human beings is a choice. To everyone else reading this, the next time you see someone who doesn’t “look disabled” using a toilet. Or someone bursting through and crashing into the toilets noisily. Take a moment. Remember that not all people who have the right to use disabled toilets are in a wheelchair. Some of us have a jpouch, a lot of us have an Ostomy bag that needs emptying and changing with the use of space, a sink and a bin. And even more of us just don’t want to shit our pants in public. Think about the nearly 300,000 people in this country who have inflammatory bowel disease (not to mention the huge number of people with IBS!!!) who need to use the toilet urgently, noisily, smellily… . It’s an embarrassing enough thing to deal with before having to see disapproving looks or hear your laughs and jeering remarks. Be kind yo… . Peace out .

This adorable Russian baby may have a cute and innocent-looking face. But as soon as they find something funny, their sinister laugh makes them sound like an evil super-villain from a Hollywood film. The footage shows the baby appearing to be sitting in a car seat and as the camera films their face. The infant obviously finds something amusing as a big smile spreads across their face before bursting into a fit of giggles. But rather than a high-pitched child-like chuckle, the youngster lets out a long, evil sounding cackle. They then pause for a second and it looks as though they may cry but after they are laughing again in their own unique way. It is unknown who the baby in the footage is, although it is believed the video originated in Russia. It is also unclear exactly what made them laugh continuously for almost 40 seconds.

"Supermarket giant Coles is facing a hefty fine of at least $4 million for lying to shoppers about the freshness of its bread. Last year, Coles was found guilty for its ‘made today, sold today’ slogan, which was deemed misleading by the Federal Court in June. The supermarket was slapped with a three-year ban to no longer promote its bread as baked on the day it is sold or made from fresh dough. But lawyers for Coles claimed that the average shopper 'doesn't care' that the supermarket's in-store bread offering isn't entirely fresh, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The Federal Court banned Coles from advertising its par-baked bread from being baked fresh on the day it is sold for three years . The falsified fresh bread has generated a revenue of about $300 million for Coles . After an investigation into the marketing tactics conducted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Federal Court on Tuesday has sought penalties of at least $4-$5 million over the breaches to the Australian consumer law. The falsely labelled bread has generated an income of around $300 million over three years before former premier Jeff Kennett found that the some of the bread that was advertised as fresh was actually made in Ireland. In many instances, the breads were partially baked in factories overseas, frozen, and shipped to Australia months later to be sold as freshly baked loaves to consumers. Coles was also ordered to display a Federal Court corrective notice in its stores and on its website informing shoppers that it had broken Australian consumer law by falsely advertising bread products as 'Baked Today, Sold Today' and 'Freshly Baked In-Store'. After a thorough investigation, the ACCC is seeking $4-5million in penalties from the supermarket giant . The ban only applies to products that are partially baked off-site and then finished in-store. They also reported that Coles lawyer, Phillip Crutchfield, SC, said 'just because we're big, we shouldn't get hit with a record fine,' but Colin Golvan, SC, said a hefty fine was appropriate as 'this case is one in which consumers are led to the cash register on the basis of misconceptions about the manufacturing process.' UPDATE: Coles has been ordered to pay $2.5 million in penalties .","ACCC seeking $4-5million in penalties from Coles .

Samantha Elauf was 17 when she interviewed for a 'model' position, as the company calls its sales staff, at an Abercrombie Kids store in a shopping mall in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2008. She never explicitly voiced her religious views or her need to wear a headscarf but the assistant store manager correctly assumed she was a Muslim. She impressed the assistant store manager, who then consulted a manager and explained that she thought Elauf wore the scarf for religious reasons - but the manager said the headscarf wasn't permitted even if it was worn because of Elauf's religion, according to the suit. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Samantha Elauf, pictured outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday, was turned down for a sales staff position at an Abercrombie & Fitch store in 2008 because she was wearing a headscarf . Support: Elauf is pictured with her mother Majda Elauf, left, and P. David Lopez, General Counsel of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), as they leave the Supreme Court in Washington . The headscarf, or hijab, conflicted with the company's Look Policy, a code derived from Abercrombie's focus on what it calls East Coast collegiate or preppy style. Abercrombie has said it didn't violate the law because it never got 'direct, explicit notice' from Elauf that her practice conflicted with the company's policy. At the time of the interview, the policy required employees to dress in a way that's consistent with the clothing Abercrombie sells, and it prohibited wearing headscarves or anything in black. The company has said it changed its headscarf policy as early as 2010, but the ban on black clothing remains. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit on Elauf's behalf, and a jury eventually awarded her $20,000. But the federal appeals court in Denver threw out the award and concluded that Abercrombie & Fitch could not be held liable because Elauf never asked the company to relax its policy against headscarves. 'Discrimination': Elauf now works in merchandising for Urban Outfitters and has a fashion blog . Fighting back: The company said Elauf never asked them to relax its policy in line with her religious practice . '[A]n applicant or employee cannot remain silent before the employer regarding the religious nature of his or her conflicting practice and need for an accommodation and still hope to prevail in a religion-accommodation case,' Abercrombie wrote in a brief. 'Abercrombie expends a great deal of effort to ensure that its target customers receive a holistically brand-based, sensory experience. To Abercrombie, a Model who violates the Look Policy by wearing inconsistent clothing inaccurately represents the brand, causes consumer confusion, fails to perform an essential function of the position, and ultimately damages the brand.' Elauf now works for Urban Outfitters and also runs a fashion blog. The case being argued Wednesday explores when an employer must take steps to accommodate the religious beliefs of a worker or job applicant. Organizations of state and local governments are supporting the company out of concerns that, if the EEOC prevails, they would be subject to more discrimination claims as large employers. Battle: Elauf is pictured outside the federal courthouse in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2011. The Supreme Court is now considering her employment discrimination claim . Muslim, Christian and Jewish advocacy organizations have weighed in on Elauf's side, as have gay-rights groups. A legal brief on behalf of Orthodox Jews argues that requiring job applicants to voice the need for religion-related special treatment makes them less likely to be hired, with no reason given for the decision. Orthodox Jews who wear a skullcap, or yarmulke, or who may not work on Saturdays are routinely advised to withhold that information until after they are hired, lawyer Nathan Lewin said in his Supreme Court filing.","Samantha Elauf arrived for an interview for a 'model' position at an Abercrombie store in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2008 wearing a black headscarf .

"The current student loans system under which graduates only start repayments when they earn more than £21,000 is unsustainable, according to a leading economist. The threshold for paying back student loans was increased from £15,000 to £21,000 in 2012. But Professor Nicholas Barr said the system costs the taxpayer too much. The academic, from the London School of Economics, suggested lowering the threshold to £18,000, or at the very minimum ensuring that the current threshold is not linked to inflation. Cost of an education: A leading economist warns that the current system of student finance through loans is unsustainable and that graduates need to start repaying their debts sooner . He said the move would help to ensure that degree courses remain high quality and that everyone, including those from poorer backgrounds, have a fair chance of going to university. Speaking at a conference on the future of tuition fees, the professor praised some elements of the Coalition’s higher education reforms, including tripling tuition fees to a maximum of £9,000 a year and raising interest rates on student loans ‘to something approximating the Government’s cost of borrowing’. But he said the system was still too expensive and therefore student numbers risk being capped. He added that his proposal would help to ensure the cost of loans does not outweigh the funding to universities – in turn ensuring that degree courses remain high quality and that everyone, including those from poorer backgrounds, have a fair chance of going to university. He said: ‘What was good about the 2012 reforms was raising the fees cap, raising the interest rate on student loans to something approximating the Government’s cost of borrowing. ‘What was bad was abolishing taxpayer’s support for the arts, humanities and social sciences, which pre-supposes that those subjects have no social benefits. Nicholas Barr: He praised some the tripling tuition of tuition fees to a maximum of £9,000 a year and raising interest rates on student loans . 'I think it is generally agreed that higher education has significant private benefits but it also has social benefits, so the cost should be shared.’ In 2012, the interest rate of student loans was raised roughly in line with the cost of borrowing, and graduates began to repay money when they were earning £21,000, up from £15,000, with repayments linked to wages. ‘That is unsustainable,’ Prof Barr said. ‘In the 2006 system, the interest subsidy made loans fiscally expensive leading eventually to a cap on student numbers. 'The 2012 reforms fixed the problem but loans continued to be fiscally expensive because of the increase in the repayment threshold. 'So the new system creates the same problem, the numbers cap or upward pressure on public spending for the same reason - the high cost of loans.’ He added: ‘If the fact that loans are fiscally expensive means student numbers are capped that compromises the objective of size. 'If student numbers are capped then student loans over time, the fiscal cost of loans will crowd out the income going to universities, which puts quality at risk, and in terms of access heavily subsided loans are a really bad way of trying to widen participation. 'It’s spending money that ought to be spent widening participation on the wrong things. ‘So what needs to happen is to make the loans system sustainable, that means you need to reduce the fiscal cost. That means the threshold needs to come down, one way or another.’ Access: But he said the system was still too expensive and therefore student numbers risk being capped . Professor Barr's suggestion is the reverse of a concession made to the Lib Dems when tuition fees were raised in 2012, when it was agreed that the threshold would rise with inflation each year. Labour is widely expected to outline its policy on tuition fees shortly, and Ed Miliband recently hinted that he would pledge a reduction in tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000. However, he has faced a backlash from university leaders, who have questioned how the funding shortfall would be plugged. At the weekend, shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said the process to agree the policy had been difficult partly because the Opposition is ‘determined not to repeat the mistake of Nick Clegg’ and make a promise in their manifesto which they cannot keep.","LSE Professor Nicholas Barr warns the current system is too expensive .

"The popularity of juice and smoothie diets has boomed on the back of celebrity-promoted fitness regimes. But the fad has suffered a blow after watchdogs crushed the health and fat-busting claims behind a string of recipes. Ads featuring nutrition guru Madeleine Shaw asserted that juices containing watermelon, beetroot, pineapple and other fruit and vegetables could reduce fat and tone the stomach. Watchdogs, however, banned the commercials after ruling the claims were not backed up by robust scientific evidence. Banned from our screens: A screengrab from an advert for a Philips juicing machine featuring Madeleine Shaw, which claimed juices containing beetroot, pineapple and other fruit and vegetables could reduce fat . The three ads were commissioned by Philips for its juicing machines. Sales of juicers have gone through the roof thanks to their association with the health regimes of stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. These particular ads all starred Miss Shaw, whose clients include Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh. In the first commercial, she explained how to make a Watermelon Cooler juice, which she described as an ‘amazing fat buster’. The second showed her making a Classic Cleanse juice, which she said could ‘reboot’ the body. One of the key ingredients was beetroot, which she claimed ‘acts as a great cleanse for the liver’. A third commercial, which appeared on the Philips YouTube channel, featured Miss Shaw making her Beat the Bloat juice, which contains mint leaves and pineapple and is ‘great for toning your tum’. Philips said the flesh of a watermelon contained citrulline, an amino acid that is converted by the body into arginine, which is said to improve blood flow and cardiovascular health. It said there was preliminary evidence from animal studies that demonstrated a greater conversion of citrulline to arginine could help prevent excess accumulation of fat. It also said fresh mint was a diuretic that helped bowel movements and aided weight loss. However, the Advertising Standards Authority investigated the science behind the claims and found they did not stand up to scrutiny. Specifically, the evidence – from a study on mice and an article on a website – was not good enough to demonstrate that watermelon and mint could contribute to fat loss. Snake oil: The Advertising Standards Authority investigated the science behind the claims made by Miss Shaw in the three adverts she did for Philips and found they did not stand up to scrutiny . Celebrity health experts: Miss Shaw does yoga with former Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh. Miss Shaw said 'juicing should be part of a well-balanced and nutritious diet' and was not a quick fix . The ASA said the claims about the benefits of the beetroot stemmed from research on liver injury in rats. It said there was no robust clinical evidence it could cleanse a human’s liver. Philips argued the use of mint leaves and pineapple in its Beat the Bloat juice helped to eliminate excess gas around the stomach, so making the muscle tone appear more visible. But the ASA said the company could only provide articles from the internet, rather than robust clinical trials to back up its claims. Given the lack of evidence, the watchdog found the commercials were misleading. Miss Shaw insisted the juices she created would deliver health benefits. She said: ‘I firmly believe there are no quick fixes or short cuts in food and that juicing should be part of a well-balanced and nutritious diet.’ Philips said in future it would ensure any nutritional claims on behalf of the company would be backed by ‘robust’ evidence.","Advertising Standards Authority bans three juicer adverts from our screens .

"Heavy snow has turned   New England into a frozen winter wonderland, but the icicles and ice dams taking over local buildings are also a dangerous threat. Portland, Maine resident Adam Sousa had his car wrecked this weekend by falling ice that shattered the windows, dented the body and caved in the bumper. Luckily the 28-year-old wasn't in the car at the time, since a 3-foot-long ice chunk smashed through the windshield and landed right between the driver and passenger seats. He says the ice chunk was so heavy, both he and a tow truck driver struggled to move it together. Scroll down for video . Shattered glass: A resident in Portland, Maine had his car wrecked on Sunday when it was struck by falling ice in the Old Port part of town . Look up: The huge chunks of 3-foot-long ice, some weighing more than 100 pounds, hit 28-year-old Adam Sousa's car, seen parked above . Out of luck: Sousa's liability insurance doesn't cover the cost to fix his 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier. He is now working with the building's owner Joseph Soley to see if that man's insurance will help fix the car . 'I thought maybe an icicle would fall off, not a whole car-size piece of ice,' Mr Sousa told WMTW of his expectations parking his 2003 Chevy Cavalier outside the building on Sunday. Mr Sousa dropped his car off in the morning, took the bus to Freeport and then returned in the afternoon to find the startling damage. Unfortunately, his liability insurance doesn't cover the cost to fix his car and the city can't help either. 'What they told me when I spoke to the police is that they can't really do much, because it's an act of nature. But from what I saw, the size of those ice chunks, they're a 100- 150-pound ice chunks,' Mr Sousa said. However, he has contacted the building's owner, Joseph Soley, who is looking into whether his insurance might cover the cost of repairs. Mr Sousa told  the Press-Herald that he talked to Mr Soley on Tuesday afternoon and that their conversation was friendly. Wrecked: Falling ice chunks shattered several windows on Mr Sousa's car and banged up much of the body . Rule breaking: It's a violation of Portland city ordinance to leave dangerous icicles and ice dams on buildings . 'He said he would contact his insurance and he seemed very nice about it,' Mr Sousa said. 'He did ask why I didn’t park somewhere else.' On Monday, the city investigated and determined that Mr Soley had violated a city ordinance against dangerous ice and snow buildup. Building owners are required to clean up such threatening ice, and if not, they can be fined up to $250. City officials say Mr Soley will not face any sort of criminal charges. 'When that ice dam is noticed, or obviously presents a hazard, they're required to mitigate that hazard.' Tim Nangle of Portland Fire and EMS said. Time of need: Friends have been helping drive Mr Sousa to and from his job as a bartender at a local restaurant and a GoFundMe campaign has already raised over $3,000 for Mr Sousa's expenses . However, Mr Nangle added that sometimes there are logistical challenges to keeping building owners from cleaning the dangerous ice in winter -  such as the demand for workers to scrape the ice across the city. Still, Mr Nangle says he's never seen damage to a car as bad as what happened to Mr Sousa. 'It really was a significant chunk of ice that went through the windshield,' Mr Nangle told WCSH. 'I was surprised and actually glad that there was no one in the car.' In the meantime, friends have been driving Mr Sousa to and from his job as a bartender at DiMillo's Restaurant & Lounge, and he has encountered even more support through a crowd-funding campaign that has already raised over $3,000 dollars. The U.S. Bartenders Guild has also offered to host a fundraiser for Mr Sousa. 'The amount of help that everybody has been putting forth is just unbelievable,' Mr Sousa said.","Adam Sousa, 28, parked his car in downtown Portland, Maine on Sunday and returned to find it wrecked by falling ice chunks .

"Police are hunting for these seven man who are believed to be Chelsea fans who may also have been singing 'abhorrent' racist chants. In a fresh scandal for the Premier League football club, a commuter at St Pancras Station made a complaint about supporters allegedly shouting 'disgusting' abuse. British Transport Police believe these men had just returned to London last Wednesday after Chelsea's Champions League match with Paris Saint Germain. 24 hours earlier the club's supporters caused worldwide outrage after they repeatedly pushed a black man off the Paris metro followed by chants of 'we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'. Appeal: Police want to speak to these four men pictured, seen as part of a group of seven at St Pancras Station, about allegations of racist chants . Row: The alleged chants in London came hours after Chelsea fans were heard singing: 'We're racist and that's the way we like it' in Paris. Police would now also like to speak to these men . It is not known what the St Pancras gang are accused of shouting, but it is believed to be similar to the Metro chant. Two of the seven men pictured today have already contacted the police after the appeal. Detective Sergeant Steven Graysmark said: 'I want anyone who knows the men in the photographs to come forward. I believe the seven, thought to be Chelsea fans, can help us with the investigation'. Supporters have identified at least six people as either witnesses or participants in the Paris incident. They are Josh Parsons, a 21-year-old City worker, and his younger brother, Benji; Jordan Munday, 20; Mitchell McCoy, 17; and 23-year-old Jamie Fairbairn. In a statement today, solicitor John Kaye, who has been engaged by Chelsea fan Jamie Fairbairn, 23, said his client had accepted being among those in the carriage of the Metro train in Paris during the incident involving the black man, Souleymane Sylla, on the evening of February 17. Mr Kaye added that Mr Fairbairn denies preventing the black man from boarding or using words of a racist or threatening nature, and also denies saying anything of a racist nature during his visit to Paris or later at St Pancras. Abuse: The Chelsea fans could be heard chanting 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' on the train. Police also want to speak to these men seen in Paris . Pushed off the train: The shocking footage was filmed before the Premier League team's 1-1 draw in a Champions League fixture with Paris Saint-Germain at Parc des Princes . Identified: Scotland Yard released images of the men they believed were among a group of supporters who allegedly pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song in France . Mr Kaye said Mr Fairbairn was not even present during the alleged racist chanting incident at St Pancras. The solicitor added that media interest in the story had forced Mr Fairbairn to move away from his home and he had been suspended from work. 'On behalf of Mr Fairbairn, I have been in contact with the Metropolitan Police to offer Mr Fairbairn's assistance as a witness,' Mr Kaye said. The latest to be named was Richard Barklie, 50, a former police officer and human rights activist from Northern Ireland. Mr Barklie issued a statement through his lawyer in which he admitted involvement in an 'incident' that resulted in Souleymane S being 'unable to enter part of the train', but denied singing any racist songs. Scotland Yard is investigating but cannot arrest people for offences which happen outside the UK. It is likely to seek football banning orders. Police in France are also probing what happened and anyone convicted of singing racist songs can face three years in prison and a £33,000 fine. On camera: Friends said Josh Parsons (left) who attended £30,000-a-year Millfield School appears (right) in this image from the horrifying video. The 21-year-old City worker has not spoken out against the allegations . Circled: Jordan Munday has been named locally as  being on the train.  There is no suggestion he was involved in the pushing of the passenger or the racist chanting but could be a key witness for police . Richard Barklie, pictured, has been identified as one of the people wanted in connection with the Paris Metro racism row. Mr Barklie is a former RUC police officer from Northern Ireland and a human rights worker . Five people have so far been suspended from Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into the incident. The club has reiterated its promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the altercation and is helping police in the UK and Paris. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said the club were 'appalled' by the racial abuse, adding that owner Roman Abramovich was also 'disgusted'. Anyone with information on the St Pancras incident should contact British Transport Police, on 0800 405040, or by text, on 61016, quoting reference B8/ESUB of 24 February 2015. Information can also be passed anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers, on 0800 555111 .","Came day after Chelsea fans sang 'We're racist that's the way we like it'

"Police fear a new deadly party drug which are in the shape of the Superman logo have hit the streets of Australia. The drug, known as paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA), is usually misrepresented as MDMA or ecstasy and is often dubbed Death, Dr Death, Killer or Red Mitsubishi. It closely related to another life threatening drug, paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMA). The drug, known as paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA), is usually misrepresented as MDMA or ecstasy and is often dubbed Death, Dr Death, Killer or Red Mitsubishi. The warning comes after the death of Georgina Bartter last year who died when took what is believed to have been an ecstasy tablet. The 19-year-old was at Harbourlife Dance Party at Mrs Macquarie’s Chair in Sydney. Best friend Rebecca Hannibal, from Cammeray in Sydney’s north, is accused of supplying Ms Bartter with the pill. Queensland's Detective Superintendent Jon Wacker warned people to stay away from both PMMA and PMA drug, which had potential to cause serious harm or death. Police's warning comes after Georgina Bartter, 19, died when she overdosed on ecstasy last year . 'Our concern is that multiple overseas deaths have been attributed to the drug PMMA, in particular a pink/light red ""Superman"" symbol tablet, found to contain deadly amounts of PMMA,' he said. 'We believe there is a possibility this particular tablet form may be circulating in Australia, however this has not been confirmed at this point.' PMMA can be a white powder, but can also appear pink, beige or yellowish on the street. In Queensland, it has been detected in other tablet and capsule forms. The Dr Death pill has already killed a number of people overseas, including British couple Suzanne Van Hagen and John Worton . It also claimed the life of 15-year-old schoolgirl Martha Fernback from the United Kingdom . Det Supt Wacker said police were not just singling out one drug or suggesting one is more or less dangerous than any other. 'It is important to understand that any illicit drug is potentially lethal as you really have no idea what you’re actually buying, nor in most cases does the person selling it to you,' he said. 'We are however warning the public of the hazards of these drugs and the consequences.'

"A pensioner who suffered a punctured lung and four broken ribs after being thrown out of his seat when the driver made an emergency stop is hoping to win more than £10,000 in compensation. David Lloyd, 66, was left with horrific injuries when he was thrown to the floor of the single-decker 825 Arriva Midlands bus as it travelled from Stafford to Rugeley in Staffordshire. The father-of-three and grandfather-of-one managed to make his way home following the incident but later collapsed and was taken to hospital where he spent seven days in the critical care unit. David Lloyd, 66 (left), was left with horrific injuries (right), including a punctured lung, severe bruising and four broken ribs, when he was thrown to the floor of the single-decker 825 Arriva Midlands bus  in Staffordshire . He is now hoping to win at least £10,000 in compensation from the bus company after claiming he 'almost died' and that the injuries have ruined his life. He said: 'I felt myself thrown down with great force onto the metal floor. 'I'd just taken my mobile phone out of my pocket when the driver hit the brakes very hard and, sitting in the front seat, I had nothing to hold on to, to stop myself from falling. 'I landed sprawled out on the floor of the bus about 10ft away from my seat. 'I've never been in so much pain in my life. I didn't know where I was. 'I didn't realise just how injured I was so made my own way home. When I got in the pain got so much worse and my wife drove me to hospital.' The retired technical advisor for bathroom maker Armitage Shanks claims he sustained the injuries when the bus driver made an emergency stop on August 20 last year. He said the driver was forced to stop abruptly on the approach to a roundabout to avoid a collision with a motorcyclist. Mr Lloyd is hoping to sue Arriva Midlands for in excess of £10,000 after claiming he 'almost died' and that the injuries have ruined his life. He said: 'My injuries were very nasty and it has had a profound effect on my life' The incident occurred on a  single-decker 825 Arriva Midlands bus (like the one pictured above) as it travelled from Stafford to Rugeley in Staffordshire. Arriva Midlands is currently carrying out an internal investigaion . He said: 'The lady sitting next to me said the driver was trying to get onto a roundabout ahead of a motorbike when he suddenly slammed the brakes on. 'My consultant Dr Dominic Macleod has written a letter supporting my claim for compensation saying my injuries were 'potentially life-threatening and of a serious nature'. 'Arriva has point blank refused to accept any responsibility. I am staggered. I almost died as a result of being on their bus and they say there are not to blame. 'I am determined to get justice for this. My injuries were very nasty and it has had a profound effect on my life. 'I still find it hard to stand up and I have a pain in my groin when I walk.' He complained to Arriva Midlands, which is now carrying out an internal investigation, and said he is in the early stages of consulting lawyers.

The New York-based photographer has been using high-resolution camera equipment to capture views from a helicopter with an open door and his latest collection, the Fabricated Landscapes series, features a sky-high look at residential, city, waterside and industrial areas of the United States. Scroll down for video . Park Le Brea apartment complex, Los Angeles, California: This humungous apartment complex is named after the nearby La Brea Tar Pits . Los Angeles Intentional Airport, Los Angeles, California: LAX is the sixth busiest airport in the world and third busiest in the United States . Highway and road network, Los Angeles, California: Counting interstates and expressways, LA is second in the US in lane mileage to New York . Neighborhoods where the houses are on waterways, Miami, Florida: Unlike some cities, neighborhoods in Miami are integrated with the water . As well as the different housing styles of Los Angeles, there are studies of container ports, marinas packed with the yachts of the wealthy, airports made to look toy-like, and the sprawling highway infrastructure. Milstein, who was born in 1944 and received a BA in architecture from UC Berkeley in 1968. has always been interested in flight. The photographer, architect, and graphic designer may take aerials over cities such as Venice, Lucca or London in the future, according to Conde Nast Traveller. Marina del Rey, Los Angeles, California: This community, which has traditionally been a destination for retirees, is becoming popular again . Houses on the water, Miami, Florida: The diverse communities in the area feature many lofts, condominiums and single-family homes . Beverly Hills and Wilshire Boulevard (diagonal), Los Angeles, California: Wilshire is extremely developed and is more than 15 miles long . LAX, Los Angeles, California: The airport offers 692 daily flights to 85 domestic cities and 928 weekly flights to 67 cities in 34 countries . Milstein said: 'This series began about two years ago when I was visiting relatives in LA where I grew up and learned to fly as a teenager. 'I was walking around Beverly Hills at the base of Benedict canyon and there were these large estates with big walls and dogs and cameras and guards that would appear if you looked too close. 'And I thought It might be interesting to get a helicopter and photograph the hidden yards behind the walls . 'When I was young I would fly myself around LA and take pictures. I was fascinated by how things appeared from the air. 'So for this project I spent many hours flying around LA in a helicopter with the door off shooting with very high resolution equipment so I can blow the prints up to 70 inches for my galleries. 'I wanted to compare and contrast the way neighborhoods of different economic class appear from the air.' Container Port, Los Angeles, California: The port is now a  'premier gateway for goods and services and a bustling center for global commerce' Jeffrey Milstein, the photographer, architect, and graphic designer (above), was born in 1944 and graduated from UC Berkeley in 1968 . A waterway community, Miami, Florida: In 2013, 417,650 of Florida's 19,600,311 residents lived in Miami, according to US Census Bureau data . Container Port, Los Angeles, California: Several hundred species of fish and marine birds call the ecological habitat at the port their home . Milstein told Daily Mail Online shooting from a helicopter is more expensive than taking photos from a plane, but it 'gives more ability' and can 'go much slower and lower'. He said: 'I use a stabilizing gyro because there is always some movement. 'I like to compose graphic images. 'My background as an architect wants symmetry and straight lines so I have to be in close communication with the pilot in trying to get exactly where I want. 'I like to ponder how things are created and from above you can see how the geography of the landscape affects the arrangement of roads and residential and commercial building sites and understand more about why the city looks the way it does. 'You can also see the hand of the architect in planned developments in ways you never can from the ground. 'I have always loved flying since I was a boy. 'Part of that thrill was being able to see everything from the birds eye. I hope I can share some of that fascination with these photographs.' Downtown Los Angeles, California: In this overhead shot, the markings on the helipads show their weight-bearing capacity numbers . Container Port, Los Angeles, California: More than one million cruise passengers travel to and from  facilities at the port each year . Brickell Key, Miami, Florida: A small gated island in downtown Miami, Brickell Key is only minutes away from the airport and South Beach . Elevated roadways, Los Angeles, California: Of the 36 largest metro areas, Los Angeles is last in terms of freeway lane miles per resident . He continued: 'The higher the value of the neighborhood the more likely the homes will not be on a grid. 'The wealthy areas often have yards with pools and tennis courts lined up within feet of each other on opposite sides of a hedge, as opposed to the photo of the trailer park where there is a shared pool. 'There is a large older housing project in the middle of LA Called Park La brea, built in the 40s that was inspired by the innovative housing of Corbusier in Paris. 'It combines low level apartments and mid-rise towers that from the air have a mandala like appearance. 'It was an ingenious plan with common parks and towers placed so there were views from all apartments.' Milstein added: 'I also include in this group a series from the port of Los Angeles and long beach showing the Lego-like containers and ships and machinery, and the patterns they make. 'Another series is of small pleasure boat marinas, some with housing. 'And I added some neighborhoods from Miami where the houses are on waterways.' Shopping plaza, Santa Monica, California: This plaza was designed by architect Frank Gehry and the location was used in the Terminator 2 film . A neighborhood on the water, Miami, Florida: Milstein noticed expensive homes are less likely to be on a grid than cheaper houses . Park Le Brea apartment complex, Los Angeles, California: The complex is the biggest housing development in the US west of the Mississippi .

"Amanda Holden sacked her closest aide in a fit of fury after a picture of her nine-year-old daughter apparently dressed as the prostitute from Pretty Woman emerged online, it was claimed today. The Britain's Got Talent star was allegedly terrified that the photograph - which the 44-year-old wanted erased from the internet - would damage her career and blamed her adviser of 20 years. A picture of Lexi in a strapless red dress was posted on her official Twitter account on February 13 with the caption: '1990's day at Lexi's school today. Julia Roberts ""Pretty Woman"".' Ms Holden then blamed her husband Chris Hughes for the publishing the picture and denied the schoolgirl was dressing as fictional prostitute Vivian. Scroll down for video . Row: Amanda Holden sacked an aide after a picture of her  eldest daughter Lexi with the caption: '1990's day at Lexi's school today. Julia Roberts ""Pretty Woman"" was posted on Twitter by her hsuband . The inspiration: Amanda's daughter wore a similar outfit to that of Julia Roberts' character Vivian but Amanda later denied this was what she was aping . Ms Holden was apparently worried about what the picture might do for her career because she will be leaving Britain's Got Talent and is looking for new opportunities. She reportedly blamed her aide of 20 years for her handling of the situation after the photograph was published, and is now being represented by One Direction's team. A source told The Sun: 'As far as Amanda is concerned, this slip-up came at exactly the wrong time and she is really worried it will affect her career. 'When Amanda realised how bad the fall-out was, she was absolutely furious and since then, she and her aide — who she has been with for years — have not been working together. 'She blamed her for not handling the situation properly'. When the picture was released Ms Holden  threatened media outlets with legal action in an attempt to erase it from the internet. Her aide reportedly infuriated her by referring her to her lawyer who said: 'Once the photo was out there, it was out'. Outrage: Amanda Holden received complaints on Twitter after she posted a picture of her nine-year-old daughter Lexi apparently dressed up as fictional prostitute from  Pretty Woman for a school fancy dress day . She blamed the tweet on her husband Chris Hughes (pictured together) 'pressing the wrong button' The post was removed after just eight minutes after it was roundly criticised by fellow Twitter users as being inappropriate as the actress plays a prostitute in the film. Amanda Holden's spokesman said: 'This story is untrue. Amanda’s change in PR agencies has nothing to do with any fears over her career, but solely due to her being so devastated that a recent story involving her daughter went out of control and sick comments were being made towards her nine-year-old. 'She felt that the situation was underestimated and not properly handled resulting in Amanda having to take legal action to ensure her child’s safety'. After the image was republished on numerous websites and in national newspapers, the Britain's Got Talent judge demanded that the media cease using the picture on the grounds that she owns the copyright. Despite the fact that it was publicly posted on her Twitter account, MailOnline agreed to remove the image, as have several other media outlets. Amid a mounting backlash over the picture, Holden released a statement insisting she was dressed as Cindy Crawford. And she put the misunderstanding down to a mistake from her husband, Chris Hughes, who hit the wrong button. In a statement she said: 'The truth is that Lexi went to school as Cindy Crawford for her school '90s Day - not Julia Roberts - as anyone who heard me yesterday at BGT - and indeed the teachers at Lexi's school - will confirm. The Britain's Got Talent judge claimed her daughter had dressed up as Cindy Crawford, pictured at the Academy Awards with Richard Gere in 1991 . Under fire: It wasn't long until followers reacted to her image on Twitter, which led to it being pulled down . Sarcastic: One person was quick to target the Britain's Got Talent judge with some advice . Unimpressed: Swathes of Twitter users reacted negatively to the picture published on February 13 . 'However my husband thought she looked more like Julia Roberts, without any thought to any interpretation. Amanda Holden released a statement today which said: 'The truth is that Lexi went to school as Cindy Crawford for her school '90s Day - not Julia Roberts - as anyone who heard me yesterday at BGT - and indeed the teachers at Lexi's school - will confirm. 'However my husband thought she looked more like Julia Roberts, without any thought to any interpretation. Although given that she is a nine year old girl it seems completely unbelievable and disturbing that anyone could or would put such an interpretation on it. 'Julia Roberts, is one of the most beautiful and iconic women in the world and so, as a proud father, he wanted to post the similarity on his own private Facebook account. He hit the wrong button and posted it on my twitter account- but removed it as soon as he realised. The first I knew about it as I was contacted by the media whilst filming today. Needless to say my husband is mortified. 'And just as an aside, on the school run this morning we bumped into 'Mia Wallace' from Pulp Fiction and 'Mr Pink' from Reservoir dogs!' 'Although given that she is a nine-year old girl it seems completely unbelievable and disturbing that anyone could or would put such an interpretation on it.

'He hit the wrong button and posted it on my Twitter account- but removed it as soon as he realised. 'The first I knew was when I was contacted by the media while filming today. My husband is mortified.' Within minutes of uploading the picture, the TV personality had received many outraged comments from her followers. In the picture, the little girl is dressed in a red, strapless gown, imitating Julia Roberts' famous on-screen character in the 1990 movie. She posed next to a piano and looked down at her feet in the photo, which showed her fancy dress costume for school. Holden, a 43-year-old mother-of-two who is married to record producer Mr Hughes, deleted the image from her timeline after eight minutes. Fans were quick to criticise her choice of clothing for her daughter, with many branding her irresponsible. One Twitter user wrote: 'Amanda Holden dressed her daughter up as Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman? A woman who had sex with an old man to get money and nice things. Another pointed out the amount of time it took for the TV presenter and actress to remove the picture of her daughter from her Twitter page. 'Eight minutes it took @Amanda_Holden to realise she'd dressed up her daughter as a hooker. Eight WHOLE minutes.' 'Totally inappropriate.wrong on so many levels,' one incensed person wrote.

"Military chiefs yesterday admitted to putting down 109 of their horses in the past six years – a rate of more than one a month. The Ministry of Defence said the animals had either become too sick or could not be found a new home. Often the animals have to be put down because they fall lame or suffer from colic – but some are simply judged to have a bad temperament. The military keeps around 500 horses, which are used mainly for ceremonial occasions such as Trooping the Colour and the State Opening of Parliament. The military keeps around 500 horses, which cost more than £1million to maintain, but for every two that are rehomed, one is euthanised. Pictured is a rehearsal for last year's Trooping the Colour . These horses cost more than £1million to maintain, and when they fall ill a decision has to be taken on whether to spend more money on vets’ fees or whether putting the animal down is the better choice. Officials at the MoD try to find new homes for horses when they cannot serve the military any more, but for every two animals that are rehomed another one is euthanised. Among the horses that were put to sleep last year was an animal called Gotthewrongun, who was suffering from an infected wound to the fetlock. Others put down were Chieftan, who had a foot condition, Combermere, who had a broken leg, Invictus, who had chronic lameness and Marley, who was suffering from a disease of the immune system. As well as the 109 horses that were put down by the MoD since 2009, a total of 526 military dogs have also been euthanised. File image used . In 2013, two horses called Geronimo and Journeyman were put down because of colic. Three others, Apocalypse, Constable and Johannesburg, were euthanised because of lameness. As well as the 109 horses that were put down by the MoD since 2009, a total of 526 military dogs have also been euthanised. Like the horses, these dogs had suffered injuries or could not be rehomed. Mimi Bekhechi, director of animal welfare charity PETA, said: ‘The Ministry of Defence has no business using horses, dogs or any other animals. ‘They are not soldiers, nor are they pieces of military kit to be used and then decommissioned at the end of their involuntary service. ‘While painless euthanasia is the only humane option for sick or wounded animals, a combat zone is no place for them.’ A MoD spokesman said: ‘The majority of our horses are re-homed at the end of their military service but our priority has to be the welfare of the animals. ‘Sometimes, we sadly have to put down animals that are in pain, have debilitating diseases or are a danger to others. ‘That decision is only taken as a last resort, based on veterinary advice. They are not pieces of kit.’","Military chiefs have admitted to putting down 109 horses in past six years .

"Two high school students from Toronto took sued their school principal after they were forced to undergo a breath test at their prom last summer. The Northern Secondary School students went to court after headteacher, Ron Felsen, demanded that all the teenagers who attended the end-of-year party be breathalyzed. The Superior Court ruled in the students' favor stating mandatory breath testing would infringe on their constitutional rights. Taking a stand: Simon Gillies, left, and Brett Gorski, right headed up the student council at Toronto's Northern Secondary School and  took their principal to court to fight compulsory breath testing at prom, and won! The judge in the case ruled on the side of the students saying that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy and reminded teachers that schools simply do not have the authority to conduct such a type of search. Civil litigation lawyer, Jonathan Lisus, who acted on behalf of the students'  said the ruling would set a precedent. Mr Lisus said it was more than just about alcohol at school proms but that it was affect the law of the land. 'This was an important confirmation of the role of the charter in a free and democratic society,' he said. The furor began when Principal Felsen decided to introduce compulsory breath testing at prom without alerting the school council. The thinking was, that random breath testing would curb the numbers of students being drunk school parties which in the past had seen a number of party-goers end up in hospital. Best interests: Principal Rob Felsen said  mandatory breath testing was a 'last resort' to counteract a culture of intoxication at school dances, which had seen two of his students hospitalized in recent years . Blow out! Principal Felsen wrote a letter to the school community stating that Breathalyzers would not be used at any upcoming proms . Felsen said that the idea was not only meant to identify those who were intoxicated, but to also act as a deterrent . 'We want students to enjoy themselves at prom, but we have to make sure they are enjoying themselves within the law,' he told the Toronto Star. Students Brett Gorski and Simon Gillies, the president and vice-president of the school council, disagreed with the decision. Moreover the pair were simply irked that the headteacher had not consulted with the student body first. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association were contacted for guidance and a lawsuit was brought against Felsen and the Toronto District School Board last May. On the night of the prom, with the lawsuit pending, the school dropped its idea to roll out breath testing. No students were kicked out for being drunk and disorderly. Ms Gorski, 18, told the Toronot Star she was 'thrilled' with the ruling. 'Students deserve to know that they have rights and, despite their age, they have the power to defend themselves,' she said. Their lawyer, Mr Lisus, was also suitably impressed with the outcome. 'That is exactly the kind of behaviour we should be encouraging in our young people and that is exactly the reason why we shouldn't be applying mass randomized searches to students. It's the wrong way to teach them about fundamental values and the way to resolve differences of opinions in democracy.' Felsen wrote a letter to the school community Monday evening outlining the court's decision and stating that Breathalyzers would not be used at any upcoming proms.","Head wanted to curb drinking at Toronto high school's 2014 senior dance .

"More than 75 vehicles got tangled up in a series of chain-reaction pileups Wednesday along a snowy stretch of Interstate 95 in Maine, injuring at least 17 people, state police said. The pileups in Etna, near Bangor, happened at about 7:30 a.m. and involved several cars, a school bus and a tractor-trailer, state police spokesman Steve McCausland said. No fatalities were immediately reported, but McCausland said some of the injuries were serious. Emergency personnel climbed on top of cars to reach motorists stuck in the middle of the jumble of vehicles. McCausland said one veteran trooper described the site as a 'giant pile of metal.' Scroll down for video . Accident: More than 75 vehicles got tangled up in a series of chain-reaction pileups Wednesday along a snowy stretch of Interstate 95 in Maine, injuring at least 17 people, state police said. Wreckage: A mangled vehicle from a multi vehicle pileup sits along Interstate 95 in Etna, Maine, about 20 miles west of Bangor, Wednesday . State police said the crash was the biggest in Maine in more than 15 years. Rhonda Kent, an occupational therapist from Saint Albans, said her car was sideswiped amid the pileup, which sent cars and trucks spinning. Kent, who was not injured, said a logging truck came dangerously close to hitting her and spun off into a ditch. 'It was almost surreal, something you see in the movies,' Kent said. Both northbound lanes on a 30-mile stretch of highway were closed for five hours, and drivers were told to take other exits to avoid the area. One northbound lane reopened around 12:30 p.m.; the other opened several hours later. Two hospitals reported taking in 17 patients, some in serious condition. One person at the scene of the crash had a heart attack and some people suffered broken bones, police said. Three students on the bus were shaken up but not injured. Police said the main crash involved more than 25 vehicles, and there were a series of other wrecks leading up to the crash site. Some of the crashes involved two or three vehicles, and then other vehicles went off the road to avoid hitting them. State Police Lt. Sean Hashey said he was 'absolutely shocked that we don't have any fatalities.' He said the crashes were likely the result of poor visibility, slippery roads and speed but cautioned that reconstructing exactly how the events unfolded could be impossible. 'We'll never know exactly who hit who,' Hashey said. 'It was just such a mess of vehicles.' At a travel stop in nearby Newburgh, people involved in the crash gathered to give statements to police and wait to see their wrecked vehicles. Some were keeping warm in a parked school bus. Workers at the truck stop reported seeing more than a dozen ambulances try to access the highway from a nearby ramp. Rose Butts, a hospital housekeeper from Plymouth, said she swerved to miss part of the accident and hit a snow bank. She and a friend were not injured but waited in her car for five hours for help. 'We're thankful that we're both alive and both OK,' she said. Dylan Carroll, a Plymouth auto mechanic, said he swerved and hit a snow bank before a garbage truck spun out, tapped his car and blocked him. He was not injured. 'I thought it was going to be much worse than it was,' Carroll said. There was at least an inch of snow on the ground at the time of the crash, according to the National Weather Service. Snow was forecast to fall throughout the day with total accumulations of 5 to 9 inches. State police spokesman Steve McCausland said the pileup happened early Wednesday in heavy snow and involved many cars, a school bus and a tractor trailer . No fatalities were immediately reported but McCausland says some of the injuries were serious .","More than 75 vehicles crashed Wednesday on a snowy stretch of Interstate 95 in Maine, injuring at least 17 people, police said .

"An unusual comet that is unlike anything seen before by scientists is expected to become visible from Earth in the coming weeks. Nasa and the European Space Agency's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, also called SOHO, spotted the comet as it skimmed past the sun. The is not thought to belong to any known family of comets and scientists have been left baffled as to how it survived its close encounter with the sun. Scroll down for videos . Comet SOHO2875 can be seen developing a tail in the image above as it moves away from the sun while a coronal mass ejection - an eruption of solar material - is thrown out into space by from the sun's surface . The comet raced past the star at the centre of our solar system at a distance of just 2.2 million miles from the sun's surface. If you've ever bitten into deep fried ice cream, you might have experienced a taste and texture that was out of this world - in more ways than one. That's because, according to Nasa, the structure of Comet 67P - which Esa's Rosetta spacecraft is currently orbiting - resembles the popular dessert. In an experiment, they found that while the exterior of a comet is encased in a hard, outer crust, the interior would mostly be fluffy ice. The scientists said the crust is made of crystalline ice while the interior is colder and porous. Organic molecules like those found on Comet 67P are like a 'final layer of chocolate' on top. Most comets that come that close do not survive the trip, according to solar scientists who study images beamed back by SOHO. Yet this comet managed to survive, said Dr Karl Battams, a solar scientist at the Naval Reearch Laboratory in Washington DC. However, he warned the close encounter with the sun may have taken its toll. He said: 'There's a half-decent chance that ground observers might be able to detect it in the coming weeks. 'But it's also possible that events during its trip around the sun will cause it to die fairly fast.' Scientists are now attempting to calculate the path the new comet. SOHO was initally designed to study the internal structure of the sun and the huge explosions that send the solar wind racing across the solar system. However, it has also become a major source of comet discoveries as these giant balls of ice and rock light up as they encounter the intense streams of ionized gas that is thrown out by the sun. Now SOHO has discovered 2,875 comets. Most belong to the Kreutz family, which all broke off from a single giant comet many centuries ago. This latest comet, however, does not bear any resemblance to these other comets nor any other family known. Such non-group comets only occur a few times a year. In a video released by Nasa the comet can be seen appearing on Febuary 19 and taking a huge curving path away from the sun. Towards the end of the video, as the comet begins to develop a tail, a coronal mass ejection from the sun throws huge amonts of solar material into space.","Scientists say the comet does not fit into any of the known comet families .

"Jailed: Steven Conner deliberately ran over his girlfriend leaving her with a broken leg . A man has been jailed for attacking his girlfriend with his car, running her over and leaving her with a broken leg. Steven Conner followed the woman in his vehicle before ramming into her - then told police he did not know who she was. The violent boyfriend, who is said to have 'psychopathic traits', was sentenced to 11 years in prison after being found guilty by a jury at Leeds Crown Court. Conner, 28, pursued his girlfriend in his car then came off the road in Kirkstall, a suburb of Leeds, and mowed her down. However, he stayed at the scene and then told emergency workers that he did not know the identity of the woman he had hit. The victim was left with a broken leg as well as serious cuts and bruises all over her body. She is now emotionally scarred and is scared to cross the road after her ordeal, which has forced her to put her career on hold. Conner denied inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and showed no remorse for his actions, forcing his victim to give evidence during his trial. Judge Penelope Belcher described the case as 'deeply troubling'. She told Conner: 'It is astonishing that she was not more seriously hurt. You were very clever in the witness box in making things fit to the things that you heard. 'It is plain that you are intelligent and that is an example of you trying to avoid responsibility for what you had done.' The jury had heard the victim has had to delay her plans to become a drugs support worker because of the ordeal. Scene: Conner attacked his victim with his car on this road in Kirkstall, a suburb of Leeds . Detective Inspector Dave Cowley said: 'Conner is clearly a dangerous individual who pursued his partner and used his car as a weapon to attack her. 'It was only through good fortune that his actions did not have more serious consequences for her. 'The victim was determined to highlight the extent of domestic violence against her by someone who appeared to be an unlikely perpetrator. 'The significant sentence he has received shows the seriousness with which serious domestic violence incidents like this will be treated. 'We hope it will encourage other victims of domestic violence to come forward and report what is happening to them.'","Steven Conner, 28, followed his girlfriend in his car and rammed into her .

"The former Colorado police chief who led the investigation into the murder of six-year-old beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey has admitted that officers botched the initial handling of the crime scene. Mark Beckner, former chief of the Boulder Police Department, gave his most extensive comments on the case to date in an 'Ask Me Anything' session on Reddit on Saturday. But he has since said that he had no idea he was speaking on a public forum, and that he regretted his 'naivete'. 'I talked to the organizer, and my impression was that this was a members-only type group that talked about unsolved mysteries all around the world,' Beckner, 59, told the Daily Camera. Ramsey was found dead in the basement of her family's home on December 26, 1996, hours after her mother, Patsy Ramsey, called 911 to say her daughter was missing and a ransom note demanding $118,000 had been found. Speaking out: Mark Beckner, former chief of the Boulder Police Department, gave his most extensive comments on the JonBenet Ramsey case to date in an 'Ask Me Anything' session on Reddit on Saturday . Although no one has ever been charged, suspicion has long fallen on her parents, Patsy and John, but there was not enough evidence to bring charges against them and they were ultimately cleared. On the Reddit forum, Beckner, who joined the investigation nine months after JonBenet's death, said on the day JonBenet's body was found, police should have separated the couple to get full statements from them. The case was initially mishandled due to a 'perfect storm type scenario', he wrote. 'It was the Christmas holiday and we were short staffed, we faced a situation as I said earlier that no one in the country had ever seen before or since, and there was confusion at the scene as people were arriving before we had enough personnel on the scene,' he wrote online. 'I wish we would have done a much better job of securing and controlling the crime scene on day one. We also should have separated John and Patsy and gotten full statements from them that day. 'Letting them go was a big mistake, as they soon lawyered up and we did not get to formally interview them again until May of 1997, five months after their daughter was murdered.' Investigation: Beckner, pictured in December 1997, joined the investigation into JonBenet Ramsey's murder nine months after the little girl, pictured right, was found murdered in her family's basement in 1996 . Questions: Beckner said he wishes police had interviewed John and Patsy Ramsey, pictured in May 1997, immediately after the body was found. He said officers found it bizarre that the couple was barely speaking . On the botched case: 'It was the Christmas holiday and we were short staffed, we faced a situation as I said earlier that no one in the country had ever seen before or since, and there was confusion at the scene as people were arriving before we had enough personnel on the scene.' On the Ramseys: 'We also should have separated John and Patsy and gotten full statements from them that day. Letting them go was a big mistake... The officers also noticed the how distant John and Patsy seemed to be toward each other.' On her brother, Burke: 'After a short initial interview that day... Burke was only interviewed one more time and that was by a social services worker. We of course had many other questions we wanted to ask him as the investigation wore on, but were never given an opportunity to interview him again.' On a possible intruder: 'Most investigators do not believe there was a legitimate point of entry. It is unknown how an intruder may have gotten in.' On a motive: 'Neither the PD or the FBI believe this was ever a kidnapping. It was a murder that someone tried to stage as a kidnapping.' On prior sexual abuse: 'Evidence was found that would indicate she was sexually assaulted some time prior to the day of her death.' On the singularity of the case: 'The FBI told us they'd never seen a 2.5 page ransom note... Ours was and to my knowledge still is the only case in history where a body was found in the same house as a ransom note demanding money.' On who he thinks is responsible: 'I have avoided saying who I believe is responsible and let the facts speak for themselves. There are several viable theories.' For the full Reddit thread, see here. No one has ever been prosecuted in the case, and Beckner said he doubted anyone ever would be. '[I] do not believe anyone will ever be convicted in the Ramsey case,' he told Reddit users. Court documents released in 2013 showed that a grand jury recommended indictments against the Ramseys, contrary to the long-held perception that the secret panel ended their work in 1999 without deciding to charge anyone. The documents revealed that the parents had been indicted for felony child abuse resulting in death and accessory to the crimes of first-degree murder and child abuse resulting in death - but that then-District Attorney Alex Hunter had refused to sign the indictments. At the time, Hunter didn't mention an indictment, saying only that there wasn't enough evidence to warrant charges against the Ramseys, who had long maintained their innocence. On the forum, Beckner touched upon the trouble his department had experienced with the Boulder District Attorney's office under Hunter. 'DA involvement in this case was inappropriate,' he said. 'They interfered in the investigation by being roadblocks to getting things done.' Patsy passed away from cancer in 2006, and two years later, former District Attorney Mary Lacy cleared the Ramseys of any role in their daughter's death, based on DNA evidence that pointed to the involvement of a third party. Beckner would not say who he believed might be responsible for the killing - 'there are several viable theories' - but he did say that investigators did not believe there was a 'legitimate point of entry' for an intruder to get into the house that night. He said that the girl was hit hard across the head and then, after it was clear that she had not died, she was strangled between 45 minutes and two hours later, based on her brain swelling. 'The rest of the scene we believe was staged, including the vaginal trauma, to make it look like a kidnapping/assault gone bad,' he said. No role? The Ramseys, pictured in 2000, were cleared in 2008 of any role in her death based on DNA evidence that pointed to another person. It later emerged that a grand jury had wanted to indict them . Red herring: In 2006, the DA ordered the arrest of John Mark Karr, who appeared to have incriminated himself in the case, but he was promptly cleared by the police department. Beckner called it 'embarrassing' He added that they came across evidence that would indicate the girl had suffered prior sexual abuse. After an apparent sexual abuse the night of the murder, the killer then dressed her - which caused one Redditor to note: 'I guess there wasn't a time problem for the killer'. Beckner added: 'The killer also took the time to find a pad and sharpie pen, write a 2.5 page ransom note, fashion a garrote and choke her with it, then wrap her in a blanket with one of her favorite nightgowns and place her in a storage room in the basement. He/she/they then neatly put the pad and pen away and escaped without leaving much evidence.' He added that the FBI told the police they had never known of a 2.5-page note and had never had a case where the body was found in the same place as a ransom note. When police turned up at the home, they found Mrs Ramsey's tone with them 'very strange'. 'The officers also noticed the how distant John and Patsy seemed to be toward each other,' he said. Beckner, who was named police chief of Boulder in 1998 before retiring in April last year, is now teaching several law enforcement classes online through Norwich University in Vermont, and said he would consider writing an autobiography about his career. Questions: Beckner said the girl was knocked across the head and then strangled inside the family's Boulder home (pictured) before a ransom note was written - but that investigators believed an intruder was unlikely . Despite his misgivings about speaking out on Reddit, he said he believed he had spoken honestly and fairly to readers, the Daily Camera reported. 'I think the only thing I would emphasize is that the unknown DNA (from JonBenet's clothing) is very important,' he told the newspaper. 'And I'm not involved any more, but that has got to be the focus of the investigation. In my opinion, at this point, that's your suspect.' Current Boulder police Chief Greg Testa told the Daily Camera that he did not know Beckner was going to discuss the case online. 'I learned about it by seeing it posted online,' Testa said. 'I didn't read it line for line, but Mark understands the nature of that investigation, and certainly wouldn't do anything to compromise it.' He added that the investigation remains open and whenever they receive new tips in the case, they are investigated.","Mark Beckner, the former chief of the Boulder Police Department, took part in an 'Ask Me Anything' session on Reddit on Saturday .

"In the midst of one of the driest climates in the world is an oasis town with lush palm trees, flourishing foliage, and a tranquil lagoon which is said to have curative properties. The magical town is called Huacachina, and it can be found not only on adventurers' bucket lists, but also in a barren desert in Peru.

The lake is believed by some to have healing powers, and in the 1940s, wealthy Peruvians would travel to the location to bathe in its waters . This mystical town is contained within a sea of sand and is completely encompassed by the brutal environment surrounding it . The lake is naturally formed, but there is a legend that a young princess was bathing when she was discovered by a hunter and fled, leaving behind a pool of water. Her flowing cloak was said to have created the surrounding sand dunes. Now, descendents of the Inca people make their living by hosting guests coming from afar to climb to the top of a wind-sculptured sand dune and watch the sunset illuminate the golden landscape, before sailing down the slopes on rented sandboards or dune buggies. Fear not if you have visions of stumbling around lost in the desert, with a few droplets of water left in your flask. The paradise Huacachina is situated a handy 4km from the southern city of Ica, a former Spanish colonial town located on the borders of the desert. When you arrive at the 'Oasis of America,' one of the last oasis' in North and South America, you are greeted by the sights of rustic hotels, quaint shops and even an oasis library, surrounding the blue lagoon. The luscious town was popular with wealthy Peruvians in the 1940s, who used to come to bathe in the lagoon, as it was thought the waters had healing powers . The picturesque village is even featured on the back of the 50 Nuevo Sol note (Peru’s official currency). Like most deserts, the temperature is typically hot, sunny and dry with very little rain. 'High season' falls between May and August, which is winter time for the region . Tranquil waters contrast with the barren surroundings in the Peruvian settlement. The area has been declared a national cultural heritage site, by the National Institute of Culture, and it is hoped that this tranquil oasis will never become a mirage in the desert . Although there are many stories how the oasis was created, one version states that the rolling sand dunes were created around the pool when an Incan princess fled her bath after being discovered bathing by a young hunter .

"The demand on the NHS is 'greater than ever before' as it emerged 900 more patients are being admitted to hospital every day compared with a year ago. New figures published today by the Health and Social Care Information Centre reveal NHS hospitals in England dealt with 15.5 million admissions in 2013-14. That figure equates to 42,400 patients being admitted each day - 870 more on average than the previous year. Those aged 65 to 69 were most likely to be admitted to hospital, and the age group saw the greatest increase in admissions, up 66,000 from the previous year to 1.3 million. Falls accounted for 421,800 admissions, an increase of 11,000 from 2012-13, with patients aged over 65 most likely to suffer a fall. Pressure on the NHS is 'greater than ever before' as new figures reveal 900 more patients were admitted to hospital each day in 2013-14 than the previous year . Meanwhile women were more likely to be admitted for treatment, making up 56 per cent of admissions. Of the total admissions, 5.4 million were emergencies, up from 5.3 million the previous year. Experts warned the demand being placed on the health service is unprecedented, with more older people needing care. Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK said: 'The rising numbers of older people being admitted to hospital is a wake- up call that social care is in crisis and that we're not doing enough to keep older people well at home. 'Without good social care to sustain them in living independently, older people are more likely to end up in hospital. She added: 'Falls are a serious threat to older people's health, wellbeing and independence, causing pain, distress and loss of confidence. 'However, despite having serious consequences, falls in later life are often dismissed as an inevitable part of growing older, when the reality is that they are usually preventable. 'Properly funded social care would make a huge difference to people's lives, helping to keep them well and ultimately saving money in the NHS. 'Hospitals can work better for everyone if we do more to prevent the need for older people to be admitted in the first place, as well as making sure that when people do need inpatient care, they are supported to get home as quickly as possible.' Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents more than 500 NHS organisations, said: 'Pressures on the health and care system have never been greater. NHS Confederation chief executive Rob Webster said: 'To improve care and tackle these pressures we need to radically reshape services around people's needs and aspirations' 'To improve care and tackle these pressures we need to radically reshape services around people's needs and aspirations.' To do that the Confederation and 23 organisations, which include leading charities and various medical Royal College, are urging all political parties to focus on four key healthcare issues in the run up to the election. A 12-page document, The 2015 Challenge: Our Prescription For The Election highlights the importance of political leadership alongside health and care leadership in helping secure change. It calls for politicians to: . Mr Webster, said: 'We will only succeed in this task if the next Government and national arms-length bodies put in place the right conditions for our members to succeed. The significant steps towards this by national bodies and the political parties in recent months are very welcome, but given the huge scale of the challenges more progress is urgently needed. 'Many politicians have talked about the kind of changes to care we set out in the 2015 Challenge, for example, more supported self-care programmes and care being offered in places other than hospitals with health and care professionals working in different ways with patients and families. 'As the election approaches, we now need all candidates to play their part in a constructive debate about how to ensure health and care services are sustainable and deliver the best possible outcomes for people. 'If necessary change is blocked, the funding gap will increase and people's care will suffer. 'We also need honesty about the resources needed. The Five Year Forward View gives a start by saying the NHS will need at least £8 billion extra as well as funding earmarked for changing services. 'This must be matched by adequate social care funding and the reform which is needed to free up £22 billion of efficiencies, otherwise the whole system could become unsustainable.' Hospitals in England have failed to meet waiting time targets in A&E for five months running. The latest set of figures, published today, reveal the misery for patients is ongoing, with no sign of the mounting pressure on medical staff abating. NHS England said 91.6 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival in A&E to being admitted to hospital, transferred or discharged. The figures reveal performance for the week ending February 15 and is down from 92.9 per cent the previous week - short of the 95 per cent target. The damning statistics mark the 20th consecutive week that the A&E target has been missed. Dr Barbara Hakin, national director of commissioning operations for NHS England, said: 'Last week saw a sharp increase in A&E attendances and emergency admissions - up by nearly 15,000 on the week before. 'These are the highest levels since Christmas and are also up on the same week last year. Hospitals across England have failed to meet waiting time targets in A&E for the last 20 weeks . 'This has resulted in a slight impact on waiting times, but we continue to admit, treat and discharge more than nine out of 10 patients within four hours. It comes as A&E waiting times in England plummeted to the lowest level in a decade, a reflection of the growing 'crisis' in the NHS. Figures reveal from October to December, 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target. The latest performance marks the worst quarterly results since the target was introduced at the end of 2004. It comes as hospitals across the country face exceptional demand and unprecedented pressures. Ten hospitals have declared 'major incidents' – an emergency trigger usually reserved for air crashes or terror attacks. Emergency plans have been implemented, including calling in extra staff and cancelling non-emergency care, including routine operations. The Government today admitted the figures were 'disappointing' - and conceded there is a 'huge amount of pressure' on the health service. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said hospital bosses feel they are 'running just to keep still' to cope with rising demand. Prime Minister David Cameron said much of the pressure on emergency departments comes as society faces an ageing population, with more frail, elderly people. But he insisted that around 2,500 more patients were being seen within four hours every day than four years ago.","Figures show 15.5 million patients were admitted to hospital in 2013-14 .

"Lester Holt's audience shot up by more than half a million viewers on his second week filling in at NBC's 'Nightly News' for the suspended Brian Williams. Then again, his rivals fared just as well. NBC's newscast averaged 10.1 million viewers last week, roughly 600,000 more than the week before, the Nielsen company said. But on a busy news week with many viewers shut in by the cold, ABC's World News Tonight gained about the same number of viewers and the CBS Evening News shot up by 900,000. Manning the ship: Lester Holt has helped NBC hold on to its primetime news lead in his two weeks behind the desk as a stand-in for Brian Williams . The result is evidence that 'Nightly News' did not take a big hit, at least initially, because of the suspension of Williams for six months for misrepresenting his experiences covering the Iraq War in 2003. Nightly News had about a 400,000 edge in viewers over 'World News Tonight.' However, that 400,000-viewer advantage over ABC is smaller than the average 587,000-viewer edge by NBC for the season that began last September. Holt, 55, has been with NBC News since 2000 and before that worked as a news anchor in Chicago for 14 years. Besides being Williams' chief sub for the past two years, he co-anchors Dateline NBC, Weekend Today and Nightly News on the weekends. He's been placed in a uniquely awkward position, asked to right the ship for a company desperate to get out of the headlines, not knowing whether it's a temporary position or one that could become permanent. And if Williams does not return, what can - or should - Holt do to prove he's the right person for the job? Gunning for the job? Holt has been Williams' stand-in for years. Holt is choosing to keep his head down and do the job, not speaking publicly about his role and it remains unclear if the 55-year-old broadcast veteran has his eyes on Williams' job. Nor is it clear if that job is even on the table . 'It's tough,' said veteran news executive Rick Kaplan, once Holt's boss when he was MSNBC president. 'He has to be very careful, because until Brian's future is outlined very clearly, Lester is just doing the network a favor in a way.' He called Holt a wise choice for the role. Holt has unassailable credentials, works hard and does the job without drawing attention to himself, Kaplan said. 'What NBC needs is quiet competence, and Lester has that in abundance,' Kaplan said. 'Lester is someone everybody can be proud of. He is somebody the people of NBC News can be proud of and rally behind, because that's what they need right now.' Holt is choosing to keep his head down and do the job, not speaking publicly about his role. He's an accomplished bass guitar player, but he's not going on entertainment programs to show his chops or swap stories about the news business. Frequent appearances on talk shows led to trouble for Williams, and NBC knows that it's no time to display how entertaining their news anchor is. Suspended: Williams, here with his Girls star daughter Allison Williams, was suspended from the network after it was revealed he'd lied about his experiences during the Iraq war in 2003 . 'I never believed the anchorman should be the know-it-all,' Holt said in a 2003 interview with The Associated Press. 'And I try to communicate that to the audience. While I have some knowledge from my years of experience, what I want to do is walk you through this because we're all walking through this together.' When the Iraq War started last decade, MSNBC similarly worked Holt hard, often giving him anchor shifts during the day and in the evening, and having him appear on 'Today' in the morning. There's no indication Holt has lusted after Williams' job. They're the same age and, until two weeks ago, Williams was about as secure as you can get in the broadcast business, armed with a long-term contract and atop the ratings. But there's also no indication Holt won't work to take advantage of an opportunity. NBC will be watching closely to see how the Holt-anchored broadcast holds up in the ratings. NBC has won 282 straight weeks in the ratings, Nielsen said. But reliance on ratings is tricky. Suppose NBC sinks - would it be because viewers didn't like Holt, or because they were angry at NBC because of what Williams did? Or angry at NBC because of how Williams was treated? Holt's lack of flashiness may be just what NBC needs now, but that's something that could be a handicap when executives are choosing the person who would essentially be the face of the network news division. Executives often feel they need stars in that role, the Katie Courics, Diane Sawyers or Matt Lauers of the world. David Muir's recent success replacing Sawyer at 'World News Tonight' shows the desire for big names may be overrated. While people like Russ Mitchell, Carole Simpson and James Brown have filled in, and Max Robinson was a co-anchor at ABC News more than 30 years ago, a black journalist has never been a sole anchor on one of the three network evening newscasts. There will be interest in whether Holt has the chance to be the first. 'I'm not ascribing motives,' said Richard Prince, a former Washington Post journalist now at the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education. 'I'm just saying that it hasn't happened.'","NBC's newscast averaged 10.1 million viewers last week, roughly 600,000 more than the week before .

"Cross-channel tensions over David Cameron's plan to claw back powers from Brussels were laid bare today, as French President Francois Hollande said helping the Prime Minister was 'not a priority'. Mr Hollande said giving the British people a say on leaving the European Union was 'not urgent' and would do little to assist Mr Cameron's push for reform. The . cross-Channel spat was being played out as Labour and Lib Dem peers in the House of . Lords killed off a Bill which would legislate for Mr Cameron's . referendum. Awkward: David Cameron and Francois Hollande tried to look relaxed at The Swan Inn barely an hour after they clashed over the need to reform the EU . After tense talks at the summit Prime Minister David Cameron took French President Francois Hollande to The Swan Inn at Swinbrook in Oxfordshire for lunch . During a tense press conference in which . Mr Hollande was also challenged about his private life, Mr Cameron . rejected the Frenchman's position, insisting there was 'no doubt' that . he would renegotiate a new EU relationship before holding an in-out . referendum by 2017. It was all smiles as Mr Cameron . greeted Mr Hollande at the start of an Anglo-French summit but deep . divisions over Europe and the economy soon emerged. Mr Holland made clear he has no intention of helping Mr Cameron in his bid to secure a new settlement with the EU through a Treaty change before staging a referendum. Speaking . at a press conference after the talks, Mr Hollande said: 'France would . like the UK to remain within in the EU. France would like to have a more . effective European which can attain the objectives which we consider to . be essential: growth, employment, energy and of course the capacity to . bring in techniques for tomorrow and protect our population.' But . he rejected the Mr Cameron's plea for urgent action to renegotiate the . power Brussels currently wields: 'France would like the Eurozone to be . better co-ordinated, better integrated. And if there are going to be . amendments of the text we don’t think for the time being that they are . urgent. 'We feel that revising the Treaty is not a priority for the time being.' Tense: British Prime Minister David Cameron hosted Mr Hollande for the one-day summit at RAF Brize Norton but the two men clashed about reforming Europe . But Mr Cameron contradicted his . guest, insisting he would plough on with his plan, which has already . attrracted the support of Germany's Angela Merkel. The PM said: 'Europe needs to change and Europe is changing. Just as the Eurozone is changing so Britain wants change in Europe. ‘My . position absolutely remains that we want to see change, we want to see . that renegotiation and that will involve elements of treaty change. 'I believe that it will be done and I believe that it will be important for Europe and important for Britain.What . people really need to know in the United Kingdom is that the in-out . referendum that I will hold if I am Prime Minister will happen by the . end of 2017. There cannot be any doubt about it.' French President Francois Hollande was seen running out of the pub where he met David Cameron for lunch . The Frenchman appeared to want a . quick getaway after a day which saw him clash with Mr Cameron on Europe . and face tricky questions about his love life . Labour's . Europe spokesman Gareth Thomas said: 'Twelve months on from his . Bloomberg speech, David Cameron's referendum policy is already fraying . at the seams. His own backbenchers are baying for more, while other EU . members have dismissed his arbitrary timetable of 2017. 'Europe . does need to change, but the UK's partners are already ruling out . treaty change on the arbitrary timetable that David Cameron has set out. 'David . Cameron's approach to Europe risks leaving the UK more isolated in the . EU and undermines Britain's ability to secure much-needed reform in . Europe.' However Labour faces accusations of being anti-democratic after unelected peers threw out a backbench Bill which would have enshrined a referendum in law. Peers voted by 180 to 130, majority 50, to end the debate of the EU (Referendum) Bill at committee stage in the Lords. The debate could resume next week but, with only one sitting Friday left in the Commons, it is now impossible for the Bill to become law. Tory chief whip in the Lords, Baroness Anelay of St Johns, said: 'Labour killed the Bill. I am disappointed.'

Miliband said he wanted to do to Britain what Hollande was doing to . France,’ the source said. ‘But just look at what Hollande has done - the . French economy is a basket case and even Hollande is having to talk . about austerity.' The International Monetary Fund expects the UK economy to grow by 2.4 per cent this year, more than double the 0.9 per cent forecast for France. While a surge in jobs has seen unemployment here fall to 7.1 per cent, across the channel it has soared to 11 per cent. House prices in the year to November were up 3.6 per cent in the UK, compared to a 1.4 per cent fall in France. Mr Hollande is without a First Lady after revelations he was having an affair with actress Julie Gayet. After it emerged he had travelled to a Paris love nest on a moped, he announced his split from Valerie Trierweiler. He officially ‘fired’ her on Saturday – signalling the end of her time as  first lady in a curt 18-word statement. French officials have said it is very unlikely that Mr Hollande will support Mr Cameron's plan to reform the EU before a 2017 referendum in Britain . Mr Cameron and President Hollande will agree further defence . co-operation on the development of new armed drones. But ahead of the talks Mr Hollande’s spokesman said it was ‘very, very unlikely’ that any treaty changes will be in place before 2017, when Mr Cameron has pledged an in/out referendum on EU membership. And he said all the talk of a referendum would frighten investors away from Britain. In a briefing for journalists in Paris ahead of the summit, the President’s spokesman said any treaty change unlikely before 2017. ‘This doesn’t mean we won’t one day require treaties to be revised for the requirements of economic monetary union, but it is very, very unlikely this will be compatible with the British political calendar,’ he said. ‘It’s in our interests that Britain remains within Europe, but it is not by changing the treaties or rules will negotiate its place in the EU. It is in our interests that Britain remains within Europe but that cannot happen at the price of dismantling Europe.’ Happier times: Francois Hollande and Valerie Trierweiler on the night he was elected French president . The official went on to warn that if the next Government agrees to a referendum, companies will be less willing to invest in the UK as the date for the vote approaches. He said: ‘The more the question becomes concrete in British national debate, the more investors and the business community warn what a Britain out of Europe would mean. ‘When investors talk, they want to access the European market through the UK. This access presupposes following a certain number of rules to maintain balance in Europe. ‘If these rules are not wanted in the UK, it will no longer have access to [the European market].’ Pub diplomacy: Tony Blair sought to win over French President Jacques Chirac in 2000 with a pint in the County restaurant in the Labour PM's constituency in County Durham ahead of a summit in France . In 2003 Mr Blair repeated the trick, taking US President George W Bush to the Dun Cow pub in his constituency . The two men announced that defence companies from the two countries will carry out a two-year study on building armed drones for their countries’ military. The ‘entente frugale’ military agreement between France and the UK was first signed in 2010, as the two countries attempted to save money following the credit crunch depression. They will now go further and will work together on developing a Predator-type drone. They announced greater cooperation on anti-ship missiles and underwater mine detectors.","Anglo-French summit to be held at RAF Brize Norton today .

"This map shows how Europe would look if every separatist movement was granted its dream of independence. With the Scottish referendum just days away, the issue of regions breaking away from their traditional rulers is looming large over the continent. The map features well-known separatist movements, such as the powerful and vocal Basque Nationalist movement in northern Spain and southwestern France, as well as the more obscure, such as the Savoyan League, which supports the independence of the Savoy region of France, which has a population of around 405,500. Scroll down for video . Recreation: This map shows Europe as it was in 1360, when many cultural groups had their own states before the unification of major countries . The map has been put together by the European Free Alliance, to which '40 progressive nationalist, regionalist and autonomous parties throughout the European Union' belong. The map shows Germany split from Bavaria, which has a population of 12.5million. Bavarian nationalism has been a strong phenomenon since the incorporation of Bavaria into the state of Germany in 1871. Venetian nationalism is a regionalist movement promoting the re-discovery of the Republic of Venice's heritage, traditions, culture and language. The Venetian Republic existed for 1100 years from 697 to 1797 and was the one of the first modern republics of the world.

Pictured, horsewomen in traditional Bavarian attire  by the renown castle Neuschwanstein as they ride to the baroque church of St. Koloman in a century-old tradition near the village of Schwangau, southern Germany . The issue of independence was largely dormant until the 1970s and 1980s, when frustration with taxes, bureaucracy, and the inefficiency of the Italian government spilled over. Separatism movements claim that local wealth is siphoned off for the benefit of a corrupt and incompetent political ruling class in capitals like Madrid and Rome. The argument has been fuelled in recent years by high unemployment and economic turmoil. Closer to home we see the nation of Cornwall on the map. Some Cornish residents say the county has a distinct identity and should be a nation state with the same rights and political autonomy as Scotland and Wales. According to a recent survey on Basque nationalism, 59 per cent of Basques want a referendum on independence, a five per cent rise in just one year. Gianluca Busato, leader of the Veneto separatists, recently said: 'The right of self-determination that is triumphing in Venice is the only way to free ourselves from the worst bureaucratic monster of the western world – the bloodthirsty beast of the Italian state.' Scottish independence would be a 'torpedo' to the foundations of Europe and wreak economic recessions across the continent, Spain's prime minister has warned. Mariano Rajoy has been trying to quell calls in the northern Spanish region of Catalonia for a similar vote on breaking away, with his government denouncing such a move as illegal. He also confirmed that Scotland would have to reapply to the EU as a separate member state should it gain independence. With the regional government in Barcelona - which has pencilled in a consultation on independence on November 9 - set to potentially give such a vote a green light on Friday, the spotlight could turn to Catalonia's drive to cut ties with Spain once Scotland votes. Last Thursday, thousands of Catalans descended on Barcelona calling for their right to vote. Responding in parliament when asked if his government would help facilitate Scotland's integration into the EU if it voted 'Yes', Mr Rajoy said: 'The whole of Europe believes these processes are enormously negative.' 'They create big problems in areas such as currency, public debt, pension payments... they produce recessions and poverty for all,' he said. 'These processes are a torpedo below the waterline of the European spirit.'","Map shows how Europe would look if every separatist movement achieved its goal of autonomy .

"Boris Johnson could be catapulted to the heart of the Tory election campaign because he outpolls David Cameron. Conservative MPs liken Mr Johnson's appeal to lager brand Heineken, claiming he 'reaches the voters other politicians don't'. A new poll shows the London Mayor's personal ratings are much higher than leaders of the main parties, as he sets out his brand of 'elementary One Nation Conservatism'. A new YouGov poll for The Times shows how Mr Johnson's popularity outstrips other senior politicians . Mr Johnson is poised to return to the Commons in May as MP for the safe Tory seat of Uxbridge and Ruislip. But there are growing calls for him to front campaign events across the country in the run-up to polling day. When Chancellor George Osborne launched the 'long-term economic plan for London', he did so with Mr Johnson at his side and not the Prime Minister. A new YouGov poll for The Times shows how Mr Johnson's popularity outstrips other senior politicians. The survey of voters in London shows 63 per cent of voters think he is doing well in his job, while just 28 per cent say he is doing badly. In a boost for the Tories, his popularity is also high among Ukip voters – despite his often outspoken attacks on Nigel Farage's party. Some 60 per cent of Ukip supporters say Mr Johnson is doing well, with only 33 per cent saying badly. By comparison, national surveys show other leaders are less popular. The latest personal ratings for Mr Cameron 43 per cent think he is doing well, but 51 per cent said badly, a net score of minus 8. Ed Miliband has a net score of minus 46 per cent, with only 22 per cent saying he is doing well, while Nick Clegg has a net score of -51, with 19 per cent saying he is doing well. When Chancellor George Osborne launched the 'long-term economic plan for London', he did so with Mr Johnson at his side and not the Prime Minister . YouGov's Anthony Wells said Mr Johns has a 'remarkable ability to appeal across party lines.' 'He even manages to attract net approval ratings of 47 per cent from Ukip voters. It is little wonder calls are growing for him to be deployed on a national campaign.' Former Tory minister Stephen Hammond told The Times:: 'Boris is Heineken — he reaches the voters other politicians don't. The election is the politics of aspiration versus the politics of envy. Boris encapsulates the aspiration part of it and we should use him as a party in all sorts of parts of the country.' Others want him to play 'a prominent national role' in the campaign to project a more 'positive and optimistic voice'. Mr Johnson told the newspaper: 'All we're offering is a very simple prescription — to support wealth creation and business, but also make sure that the proceeds of that growth are used to help the poorest and the neediest. That is elementary One Nation Conservatism.'","London Mayor's personal ratings much higher than main party leaders .

"A skin test could help detect and research conditions including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, a new study has suggested. Doctors from the Central Hospital at the University of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, studied 53 volunteers with forms of dementia to analyse skin samples for differing amounts of certain proteins compared with 12 healthy people. The researchers reported skin biopsies from those with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's had higher levels of the protein phospho-tau compared with healthy people, while Parkinson's sufferers also had higher levels of alpha-synuclein protein. Dementia currently affects more than 850,000 people in the UK, but there is no definitive diagnostic test for it . The preliminary results, doctors said, mean skin could be a useful way of detecting the diseases. There is yet to be a definitive diagnostic test for dementia, which affects more than 850,000 people in the UK, and there are calls for more people to take part in research. Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, the UK's leading dementia research charity, said: 'These new findings are yet to be published in full and it is too early to say whether this preliminary study will lead to a new way of identifying people with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's. 'This research would need to be repeated in much larger groups of people to determine whether this method could be used in future to aid diagnosis. 'Skin biopsies are already proving useful in dementia research in other ways, for example at Alzheimer's Research UK's Stem Cell Research Centre.

Derided by the English as nothing more than a tyrant, Napoleon Bonaparte remains a celebrated figure in France. Born in 1769, the great leader seized power in a coup in 1799 and became first consul. He defeated the Austrians at Marengo before negotiating peace on the continent in 1803 and establishing French dominance. But it is the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 that he is remembered for in Britain. The British - led by Lord Nelson aboard HMS Victory - secured a decisive victory over a French and Spanish coalition. Although the British officer secured a decisive victory he was shot dead while on deck. Beaten by the Brits, Napoleon turned his attention back to the continent and secured arguably his, and France's, greatest military victory the same year. In the Battle of Austerlitz the Russo-Austrian army were decisively defeated. The battle, fought in what is now the Czech Republic, saw the French gain a lot of new territory. It was the Peninsular War, which began in 1808, with Portugal, Spain and the UK, which was ultimately to prove his undoing. After being defeated in a battle in Moscow in 1812, Paris fell in 1814 after a series of disastrous French defeats. After going into exile, he regained power briefly in 1815 only to be defeated at the Battle of Waterloo. Following the Duke of Wellington's victory, Napoleon abdicated. He was imprisoned by the British and died in custody in 1821.","Around 3,000 part-time actors and history enthusiasts took part .

"British teacher Lauren Patterson (pictured) was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in Doha, Qatar, in 2013 - her killers then burnt her body . A lawyer attempting to overturn the death sentence of a man convicted of murdering British school teacher Lauren Patterson in Qatar has accused prison guards of torturing his client. Lauren Patterson, 24, from Kent, was sexually assaulted and stabbed and her burnt remains were left in a remote desert location by a local 'casual acquaintance' in October 2013. Badr Hashim Khamis Abdallah al-Jabar and his accomplice maintained Miss Patterson's death was accidental, but were found guilty of the brutal killing in March 2014. Al-Jabr was sentenced to death and accomplice Mohamed Abdallah Hassan Abdul Aziz was jailed for three years for helping to dispose of Miss Patterson's body. Both men were arrested after Miss Patterson's remains were found in a remote desert spot outside the Qatari capital city of Doha after she went missing following a night out. The lawyer, who represents both men, said his clients  had been kept in solitary confinement for 40 days between interviews with prosecutors, and the abuse they suffered would have 'clouded anybody's judgement'. The attorney did not elaborate on his torture claim, which was not raised in last year's criminal trial that ended in Al-Jabar being sentenced to death. During yesterday's appeal hearing, the defence lawyer for the two men once again repeated the argument that Al-Jabar killed Miss Patterson in self-defence and attacked her moral character, calling her 'promiscuous,' an 'excessive drinker' and 'irrational'. The defence lawyer has spent considerable time in previous hearings dwelling on Miss Patterson's drinking habits. During the 2014 trial Miss Patterson's friend Lea Monet testified how she, Miss Patterson and the two men, who she said they were 'casually acquainted with', had left a nightclub at La Cigale Hotel in Doha around 3.30am on October 12. Lauren Patterson pictured with her mother, Alison, who has criticised the defence lawyer's claims . She said Miss Patterson, who had just returned from attending her grandmother's funeral in England, was not drunk and was 'aware of her surroundings'. During the trial the prosecution said the defendant took Miss Patterson to a place he used for sexual trysts with women, 'conquered her body', and killed her by stabbing her twice. Miss Patterson (pictured) went missing following a night out in Doha, Qatar, in October 2013 . Following yesterday's hearing, Miss Patterson's mother, Alison, said she has seen 'nothing but genuine honesty, clarity and a need for the truth to prevail' on the part of prosecutors. She also took exception to the 'attempted character assassination' of her daughter by the defence lawyer, saying he provided no evidence to back up his statements. She said: 'Lauren was a hard-working girl who loved her job and spent most evenings of her time after work giving private tuition to pupils in their homes or studying to complete her degree. 'All of which can be corroborated, unlike the defence's story. 'While he attacked my daughter's character, he forgot to mention that his clients regularly frequented bars and consumed alcohol.' Mrs Patterson also said the defence lawyer did not address what the men are accused of doing to her daughter's body following her death. She argued: 'If it was self-defence, why did the lawyer not mention them removing my daughter's body to the desert by car, purchasing coal and fuel and burning her body beyond recognition and then going back to the scene to make sure they had burnt her body? 'If it was self-defence, would you do that?' During yesterday's hearing, the lawyer for the Patterson family asked that their request for 20 million QR, £3.5million, in compensation from the convicted men be referred to a civil court. Financial settlements are a common feature in serious court cases in Qatar. A final verdict is scheduled for March 23.","Lauren Patterson, 24, was sexually assaulted and stabbed in Qatar in 2013 .

"A freak lightning strike  that sounded 'like a bomb going off' sparked a massive blaze and gutted the top floor of a six-bedroom house. The family-of-four were watching television at about 9pm on Monday evening when they heard a bang and the power suddenly went off at their home in Winterbourne Down, Bristol. Initially they thought it was a fault with their washing machine, which had just started a cycle, until they heard neighbours screaming at them to get out. The devastation caused by a freak lightning strike at a house in Bristol, which caused the ceiling to collapse . The family were downstairs at the time the lightning struck as fire ravaged through the children's bedrooms . They managed to escape with their two dogs as fire ripped through the top floor of the property -thought to be worth more than £500,000 - before part of the ceiling collapsed into a bedroom. Mother Dawn, who lives at the address with her husband and two children aged, 12 and ten and does not want to reveal her surname, said the family is lucky to be alive. 'I usually put the children to bed at nine but I was running late and they were in the living room watching telly with my husband while I was in the kitchen putting a wash on. 'I was just walking away from the machine when I heard an almighty bang and everything went into darkness. They heard a bang at their home in Winterbourne Down near Bristol, but thought it was the washing machine . Looking out from what used to be the ceiling now no longer exists after it was destroyed by fire in the storm . 'I started screaming and the children came running out frightened. 'We thought it was the electrics so I got a torch and my husband went and looked in the fuse box but it had blew off the wall. Dawn said her family is lucky to be alive and has been left 'heartbroken' by the freak incident . 'We opened the door because we could hear shouting and the neighbours were behind our electric gates, which they couldn't open. 'They'd heard the bang and thought their car had exploded and then saw our roof was on fire.' She said they were probably in the house for about five minutes before getting out and calling the fire service. 'If it hadn't been for the neighbours it would have spread even more. 'The fire brigade had to fight it from outside because it was too intense before they could go in and it took about four hours to put it out. 'I dread to think what could have happened if the children had been upstairs. I'm just so glad they're okay - it could have been a lot worse,' she said. It is thought it will cost thousands of pounds to fix the damage as the whole of the upstairs may need to be gutted. The family had spent 11 years building and renovating the house to their own specifications after buying it as a four-bedroom home and converting it. Dawn said they had just put the finishing touches to it when the freak fire destroyed the boys bedrooms. Avon Fire and Rescue Service said that extensive fire damage had been caused to the roof, while water damage was throughout the house from extinguishing the flames. Toys and furniture has been covered in a layer of debris and ash after the ceiling collapsed into a bedroom . The exact cost of the damage is not yet known but is thought to be thousands of pounds worth of repairs . Dawn added: 'The firefighters said they couldn't believe the strength of the lightning - they said we were lucky to be alive. 'We are heartbroken. Much of our stuff is ruined. Because we were getting ready for bed all I had was my sisters clothes - most of my clothes are ruined. We have some of the boys clothes. 'We'd like to thank the fire service and the police for all they did and are just glad that our family is okay.' The family are currently living in a hotel until they can arrange other accommodation but have been told it could be at least Christmas time before they will be able to move back in. 'The children have been left traumatised and say they don't want to go back. At the moment I'm keeping them off school because they are too upset.' Smashed tiles from the roof lie about the garden after it was hit by lightning on Monday evening while the family were downstairs .

The London Fire Brigade is warning homeowners of the danger of leaving glass objects in direct contact with sunlight. Charlie Pugsley from the brigade's fire investigation unit said: 'These sort of fires are not as rare as you would think - I've seen everything from sparkly door knobs to crystal balls starting fires. 'Crystal and glass ornaments and items such as mirror tables should be kept out of direct sunlight. 'We wouldn't advise that people put fires out themselves but it is good to see that Ms Mone is not injured. 'This shows these fires are not an urban myth. Also make sure that you have a working smoke alarm on every level of your home.' The LFB also stressed that these blazes don't just occur in the summer, with two happening this year already. The bending of light in refraction, when light passes through an object of a different density, can cause rays to be focused onto one spot and therefore intensified. Investigators believe a house fire that killed a Jack Russell started when low winter sunlight was refracted through a glass Nutella jar, which was storing loom bands, and set fire to nearby blinds. The fire killed family pet Chili and gutted a bedroom and part of their roof, in Twickenham, south west London, on February 15. Bra supremo Michelle revealed on Wednesday last week that she was alerted by a burning smell in her home in Mayfair, west London, when a beanbag caught alight. She managed to extinguish the fire herself after the rays refracted off a mirror table earlier this month. Crews tackled a blaze in Clapham, south London, in July last year when rays passed through a crystal door know and set fire to a dressing gown. And a home was torched when a crystal ball intensified the sun's rays in Romford, east London, in February, 2014.","Family-of-four were watching television when lightning struck on Monday .

"The grandson of famous soprano and radio star Queenie Ashton has revealed how his 79-year-old Australian father was humiliatingly tied to a hospital bed in Phuket, Thailand with bedsheets and left in pain for hours during a nightmare ordeal. The unorthodox restraints were used on expat Anthony Lawson after he tried to seek help when his requests for a drink of water, an IV change and prescribed sleeping pills allegedly went unanswered for three hours. Mr Lawson, who was born in Sydney in 1935, but lived in England and Hong Kong before retiring in Thailand in 1998, was allegedly neglected and mistreated after being admitted to Phuket's main government hospital. The award-winning commercial film and video director, who once voiced a range of Cathay Pacific airline commercials amongst others and also lent his voice to Star TV in Hong Kong, later died from stage four colon cancer on January 8 while still reeling from the traumatic experience. Expat Anthony Lawson suffered a traumatic experience after he was admitted to Vachira Hospital in Phuket, Thailand, his son Ashton says . The 79-year-old Australian father was humiliatingly tied to a hospital bed with these green spare sheets after he tried to walk out of his ward to seek help . His 23-year-old son Ashton told Daily Mail Australia: 'My dad honestly believed that the increasing back pain he was experiencing was because of the incident at the Vachira Hospital that night.' 'Even right at the end, when he seemingly wasn’t consciously there, the one thing that was still always on his mind - and that’s what got at me the worst - he was still thinking about that night.' Ashton reported his father's complaint of alleged mistreatment at Vachira Phuket Hospital to Phuket City Police Station on November 27, 2014. However, it is not being investigated by police because they claim there is a lack of evidence and perhaps Mr Lawson was a danger to himself. The detailed complaint paints a traumatic picture of Mr Lawson's brief stay at Vachira after he was transferred from Mission Hospital on November 18, 2014, with a suspected pulmonary embolism following a hernia operation. Anthony Lawson's 23-year-old son Ashton, seen here with a photo of his father, told Daily Mail Australia about his father's upsetting exerpience . Mr Lawson's mother Ethel, who went by the stage name Queenie Ashton, was well-known for her role as Granny Bishop in the Australian radio serial Blue Hills which aired from 1949-76 . Following instructions from his doctors to drink a lot of water because he'd been given a contrast medium to make his lungs stand out on x-rays, Mr Lawson called out for a drink after he was allegedly given no attention for three hours since his son Ashton had left the hospital at 6pm. 'Dad said “it’s been a long day”, he said “why don’t you go home and come back tomorrow”. We felt uncomfortable but I made it clear to the staff - and I’m not a fluent Thai speaker but I speak well - I said to the staff, and I know they understood me, that if there are issues I live three minutes down the road and you have my number on record,' Ashton explained. It emerged the father-of-three's requests for water, sleeping pills and for someone to change his IV drip reportedly went unanswered for hours on end. Mr Lawson had a brief stay at Vachira after he was transferred from Mission Hospital on November 18, 2014, with a suspected pulmonary embolism following a hernia operation . At 9:30pm, Mr Lawson climbed out of his bed and walked to the nurses' station where he was allegedly ignored by a male nurse on duty. According to his complaint to police, Mr Lawson then tried to walk out of the ward to find help elsewhere but was stopped by the male nurse and three security guards who took him back to his bed. The male nurse then allegedly tied him to the bed with green sheets - without providing water or sleeping pills to ease his discomfort. 'Dad's energy levels weren't high. The nurse seemed to already have prepared the bed sheets, he found himself being bound to the bed by bed sheets. 'So he’s tied up, he’s shouting out for more help despite the fact that the ones that are meant to help him are the ones that did it. The main concern is the water and he wants IV changed,' Ashton said. In his complaint, Mr Lawson reports suffering an agonising back spasm while trying to free himself. It was not until 11:30pm that he claims he was finally given water by the male nurse. However, because his arms were tied the nurse allegedly force-fed Mr Lawson causing him to choke. 'He held the jug above my father's head and started pouring. The water was hot - not too hot that it might burn him - but the guy just kept pouring with no attempt to give him sips. Dad had to actually turn his head to stop it.' Mr Lawson was born in Sydney in 1935 but lived in England and Hong Kong before retiring in Thailand in 1998 . An attempt to escape the restraints saw Mr Lawson get as far as the car park at around 7:30am the next morning before he was hauled back to his bed. Mr Lawson's son Ashton then found him in distress after a different nurse began their shift and agreed to call to ask him to come to the hospital. 'Next thing in the morning, I wake up to a phone call at 9am - it’s my dad saying “they tied me up to the bed, get over here”,' Ashton said. 'I was bloody shocked and I rode over there, and there he is lying in bed, slightly upright and I looked down on the bed and there were indeed some knots tied into extra sheets. There were two either side for the arms and one bed sheet at the end used to hold his feet down.' Ashton spoke to his father's doctor about what happened. 'He was quite shocked but not shocked enough. He had a look in his eye and even later on said ""honestly I shouldn't say this but this hospital has too many patients and not enough staff to take care of them"",' Ashton recalled. Ashton then reportedly met Vachira Hospital’s Deputy Director Somnuek Jirayuth, International Department head nurse Ms Methavee and two other nurses on January 29 where any wrongdoing was denied. Anthony Lawson spent one night at Vachira Phuket Hospital last year when the incident is alleged to have occurred . When Mr Lawson died in January he was still upset about what had allegedly happened to him at the hospital . Mr Lawson complained that a male nurse tied him to a bed with green sheets - without providing water or sleeping pills to ease his discomfort . But Ms Methavee admitted that Mr Lawson had been restrained. The hospital claimed they tried to call Ashton, but he says he received no calls from them that night. 'I find the hospital's explanation and reasoning behind what happened to be flimsy at best,' Ashton told the Phuket Gazette, the local paper which first reported Mr. Lawson's ordeal. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Vachira Hospital for comment. Ashton admits he is 'angry' about what happened to his father. Mr Lawson believed the back pain he suffered in his last months was caused by the hospital experience, but Ashton concedes it was likely caused by the colon cancer that was already spread around his body. 'It was just sad because what if that night didn't happen? The pain would have manifested anyway and maybe the first hospital would have done more tests and found the cancer - he still would have been stage four and he still would have died, but we could have informed more family and they would have had more time to visit him,' Ashton said. It was a humiliating experience for a man who had spent the later years of his life fighting perceived injustices, with video documentaries on his own YouTube channel. Mr Lawson's own father was Lionel Lawson, a celebrated violinist and leader of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. His mother Ethel, who went by the stage name Queenie Ashton, was well-known for her role as Granny Bishop in the Australian radio serial Blue Hills which aired from 1949-76. Mr Lawson followed his parents into the entertainment business and became a highly-regarded radio editor in Australia before moving overseas to pursue his film career.","Expat Anthony Lawson was tied to a hospital bed in Phuket, Thailand .

"A shockingly high proportion of homeless gay youth in New York engage in 'survival sex' in a bid to stay alive, a new government-funded report has revealed. The Urban Institute - a non-profit organization investigating U.S. social and economic problems - quizzed 283 subjects over a three-year period. On average, the youths reported seeing up to six customers a day, with rates ranging from $90 to $230. About 90per cent said the work made them feel 'frustrated', 'dirty' or 'endangered'. Down and out: A shockingly high proportion of homeless LGBTQ youth in New York engage in 'survival sex' in a bid to stay alive, a new government-funded report has revealed . Only seven per cent of respondents said they had no desire to stop engaging in the activity. However, more than 80 percent said there were positive aspects - notably helping meet their basic needs and in some cases fostering a sense of community. 'It's not as bad as sleeping under the bridge, it's not as bad as going without food,' one respondent said. Almost half (46per cent) said they became involved in the sex trade through friends or peers, while 26per cent were approached by someone they did not know. Most got clients on the streets of New York or by posting adverts online. The study, funded by the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, focused on youth between 15 and 21, although a handful of participants were older. Of the respondents, 47per cent identified as male, 36per cent as female and 16per cent as transgender. About 90per cent were black, Latino or multiracial, and nearly 60per cent said they lived either in a shelter or on the street, often after being kicked out of their homes or aging out of foster care. One gay 19-year-old told an interviewer how his mother had forced him to leave home. 'She didn't want me being gay, she wanted grandchildren, she didn't like my lifestyle,' he said. She still loved me but she just didn't want me being there.' Many of the youths said they had some means of protecting themselves physically when trading sex - knives and Mace were the preferred accessories. On average, the youths saw 3 to 6 customers each day or night - and 11 to 18 a week - during periods when they were engaging in sexual transactions, according to the study. The report offered several recommendations for steps that might encourage such young people to disengage from the sex trade. These included new programs that would offer safe housing, appropriate health care, and a pathway to job opportunities. the particular needs of LGBT youth in mind, the report said. Any such services would be most effective if designed with the particular needs of LGBT youth in mind, the report said. The Urban Institute, which is based in Washington, D.C., did not attempt its own calculations of the overall number of LGBT youth engaged in the New York City's commercial sex market. Its report cited earlier studies estimating the number at between 2,500 and 4,000 young people of all sexual orientations. Meredith Dank, the report's lead author concluded: 'They don't see themselves as victims . . . but it's not empowering for them to be doing this.. 'These are kids in very desperate situations who will do what they need to do to be able to survive.'","The Urban Institute - a non-profit organization investigating US social and economic problems - quizzed 283 subjects over a three-year period .

"Jamaica has made it legal to possess small amounts of marijuana in a historical law change which will allow Rastafarians to freely smoke the drug. Cannabis has been illegal on the Caribbean island for decades despite it being puffed as a sacrament by Rastafarians and sung about in their reggae music. The law new makes possession of up to two ounces of marijuana a petty offence that could result in a ticket but not in a criminal record. Marijuana legalisation advocate an reggae singer Bunny Wailer smokes a marijuana pipe in Kingston, Jamaica. Possessing small amounts of the drug has now been decriminalised . Cultivation of five or fewer plants on any premises would also be permitted. Tourists who are prescribed medical marijuana abroad will soon be able to apply for permits authorising them to legally buy small amounts of Jamaican weed, or 'ganja' as it is known locally. Jamaica has long been considered as the Caribbean's largest supplier of marijuana to the United States and regional islands. But despite the new legislation, Peter Bunting, the island's national security minister has said it does not mean they have backed down from cracking transnational drug trafficking. Mr Bunting told parliament: 'The passage of this legislation does not create a free-for-all in the growing, transporting, dealing or exporting of ganja. 'The security forces will continue to rigorously enforce Jamaican law consistent with our international treaty obligations.' Debate has long raged in Jamaica over relaxing laws prohibiting ganja but previous calls to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana fizzled out because officials feared they would bring sanctions from Washington. Jamaican officials now have high hopes that the island can become a player in the nascent medical marijuana industry, health tourism and the development of innovative pot-derived items. Local scientists now hope to capitalise on the law change as they already have a history of creating marijuana-derived products . Local scientists already have a history of creating marijuana-derived products, such as Canasol, which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients. Commerce Minister Anthony Hylton said the cannabis industry holds 'great potential' for Jamaica, where marijuana has long been grown illegally on mountainsides and marshes. The move by Jamaican lawmakers adds to an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 U.S. states allow some form of medical marijuana and last year Colorado and Washington legalised personal use. Yesterday Alaska became the third U.S. state to legalise the recreational use of marijuana for adults. In the Americas, Uruguay last year became the first nation to create a legal marijuana market. In Argentina, personal possession of marijuana was decriminalised under a 2009 Supreme Court ruling that jail time for small amounts of drugs violates the country's constitution. A law in Chile also permits use of medical marijuana.","Jamaican parliament has decriminalised possessing small amounts of drug .

"Police are using Taser stun guns on youngsters every day, disturbing figures have shown. Officers wielded the 50,000 volt weapons against more than 400 under-18s in only one year – including some as young as 11 – a huge rise compared with seven years ago, when the potentially deadly devices were first cleared for use on that age group. Senior police figures are campaigning for Tasers to be handed to every one of the country’s 127,000 frontline officers. But David Blunkett, who as home secretary first authorised the weapons in the UK, said he is concerned that police are rushing to use Tasers rather than trying to defuse angry confrontations. Dangerous: Records have shown that more than 400 under-18s were Tasered by police in the latest figures . Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, he said: ‘I think it’s time for a review that incorporates the use of Tasers with advice and support on how to deal with difficult situations. 'For a youngster, 11 years old, a Taser is not in my view an appropriate way of dealing with a situation – which clearly must have been out of hand, but where we need to train people to use more traditional alternatives.’ Mr Blunkett went on to urge chief constables to look at who is authorised to wield Tasers and examine ‘whether alternatives can be used’. According to the latest Home Office figures, 431 under-18s had a Taser used against them in 2013, an increase of more than a third compared with the previous year. The figures show that they included an 11-year-old, a 12-year-old, four 13-year-olds and 33 14-year-olds. One of the Taser shootings took place at a Devon school for children with learning difficulties in December 2013. Police shot three pupils, all aged 14 or 15, at Chelfham Senior School in Bere Alston after being called to a ‘violent incident’. Concern: David Blunkett, who was home secretary when the weapons were first authorised, has called for a review on the use of Tasers . The age group most likely to face being Tasered was 17-year-olds, with some 180 incidents recorded, followed by 16-year-olds with 132 incidents. The statistics included situations in which Tasers were fired, used to ‘light up’ a target with a red sighting dot or merely removed from their holster. Tasers were introduced in England and Wales in 2003 in a 12-month trial for firearms officers in five police forces. Four years later police were told they could use them on under-18s, leading to 27 recorded cases in which they were employed. In 2008 Tasers were rolled out across the country, and were no longer limited to specialist officers. Supporters say the weapons offer a vital tool for police to defuse dangerous confrontations without the use of live ammunition. But critics are concerned that Tasers are being drawn in everyday situations to bully and intimidate members of the public. There are also fears that the weapons are being used inappropriately, for example on those already in custody, the mentally ill and the young and vulnerable. Solicitor Sophie Khan, who represents people who have been Tasered by police, said: ‘Tasers should only be used on children if there is no other feasible way to restrain them.’ But Met Commander Neil Basu said: ‘If a 14-year-old is committing a violent act or if they are self-harming, then our job is to make sure that stops in the safest way possible. And in certain circumstances Taser is that option.’","Most recent figures show police used Tasers on a total of 431 under-18s .

"A schoolgirl seduced by a RE teacher who had sex with her in a classroom cupboard spoke out for the first time today to hit back at the judge who accused her of 'grooming' him. The teenager was 16 when married Stuart Kerner, 44, took her virginity on a yoga mat at school having brought condoms with him to Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London. Kerner, who first targeted her when she helped him sort RE books in the library, took the girl to his marital home to have sex  in the same week his wife miscarried. Yet Judge Joanna Greenberg QC gave him an 18-month suspended sentence because she suggested his victim  ‘groomed’ him and he ‘gave in to temptation’. Speaking out: The victim of RE teacher Stuart Kerner - pictured outside court with his wife Katherine - has blasted the judge who said the 16-year-old 'groomed' him when he took her virginity in a store cupboard . The student, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said today that the judge's comments felt like being 'kicked in the stomach' because she was being unfairly branded a sexual 'predator'. She told The Sun: 'How did I seduce him? I didn't pounce on him. He was the teacher. He groomed me. He arranged the time and places that we would meet. 'People will picture me wearing skirts and dolled up with make-up but I'm a plain Jane. I wish the trial had never gone ahead. I regret it more than the affair.' A jury in December convicted Kerner of two counts of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust. He was cleared of four other similar charges. The girl he had sex with said his lawyers claimed she invented a fantasy relationship based on Fifty Shades of Grey, in which a more experienced man has an affair with a younger woman. Comments: Judge Joanna Greenberg QC provoked anger by saying Kerner 'gave in to temptation' But she said that Kerner was obsessed with the erotic novel - buying her a Fifty Shades-themed keyring for Christmas which included a blindfold and mask. The jury sided with her. In her first interview since his conviction she said she first met him when she was 14 and developed a crush on him. She said: 'My friends fancied Justin Bieber. I fancied Mr Kerner'. Describing how she was seduced she said she would often help him in the school library, but when they were alone he would put his hand on her leg. They first kissed when she was 15, she said. 'For months' they kept meeting in cupboard and empty rooms to kiss, she said, and then their relationship became sexual. She said: 'I had never done anything with any boy before that' and then within weeks they planned to have sex when he 'told me that he would check both of our timetables and see when we could do it'. The lost her virginity to Kerner in a school cupboard on a yoga mat, . She said Kerner had been carrying contraceptives with him at school 'for months' and also told her that he had made his wife pregnant but still had sex with the girl. Later he also had sex with her in the guest bedroom at the family home and his trial  heard he made her Marmite on toast and they watched Bargain Hunt between sessions. But the girl's step-mother discovered what had happened and reported Kerner to police against her wishes. The stepmother of the girl, who is now 19, told the Mail: 'He's the one who's committed the crime, and yet she's the one who was treated like a criminal in that courtroom. 'He was in the position of trust and he was the responsible adult. How could it be her fault? How can you blame a 16-year-old schoolgirl? We're all still in shock. 'The teacher slept with her, then called her a s*** and he's been allowed to get away with it.' The two-week trial heard that Kerner (pictured outside court) had carried around a condom for a week . In police interviews the girl described what had happened since she was 14, only to learn that Kerner had denied it all. She said: 'It hurt me because he was a massive part of my life, I lost my virginity to him. He was like my first boyfriend. The first person I had kissed. For him to deny it was really painful.' The student was then dragged into court to give evidence in Kerner's trial, which led to his conviction. Judge Greenberg prompted fury from victims' groups after she gave Kerner, whose wife Katherine stood by him, an 18-month suspended sentence at Inner London Crown Court last month. She told him: 'There is no evidence that you groomed her... It was she who groomed you and you gave in to temptation.' Groomed: The vice-principal at Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London (pictured), who has lodged an appeal, also took her to his home when his wife was at work and had sex with her in their guest bedroom . The Judicial Conduct and Investigations Office said it was considering misconduct allegations against the judge after it received 'multiple complaints'. If a complaint is upheld, it can result in a judge being disciplined, suspended or removed from office entirely. After his sentence it emerged Kerner's lawyers had formally lodged an appeal to overturn his conviction and clear his name. His solicitor Gary Rubin said: 'Not only is he planning to appeal, we actually lodged the appeal with the Court of Appeal well before Christmas. 'It was the advice given to his legal advisors that he should lodge an appeal against conviction. I lodged it within 14 days of his conviction.'","Girl has spoken out for first time since Stuart Kerner, 44, was convicted .

"A  girl who wrote to DC Comics after she was fed up of the misogynistic nature of her favourite comic books was delighted when the company transformed her into her very own hero. Rowan Hansen, 11, from Illinois, wrote a letter to the comic giants at the beginning of February expressing her annoyance with the lack of  female characters in the superhero strips. In it she called for more female characters and action figures and even pointed out that their rival Marvel comics were outdoing them in gender equality. Rowan Hansen (left) wrote a letter to DC comics complaining that there weren't enough female characters in their strips and movies, the company responded by recreating the 11-year-old in superhero form (right) In the letter Rowan wrote: 'I'm upset because there aren't very many girl superheroes or movies and comics from DC. 'There are Superman and Batman movies but not a Wonder Woman one. You have a Flash TV show but not a Wonder Woman one. 'Marvel comic made a movie about Talking Tree and Racoon Awesome but you haven't made a movie with Wonder Woman.' Rowan went on to say that she was not alone and there are many other female readers of DC comics. In her letter she tells DC that 'girls read comics too and they care', it received thousands of shares on Twitter . 'I love your comics, but I would love them a lot more if there were more girls. 'I asked a lot of the people I know whether they watched movies or read books or comics where girls were the main characters, they all said yes. 'Please do something about this. Girls read comics too and they care.' Her letter received thousands of shares on Twitter after Jim Hansen, Rowan's father posted it online.

Although Rowan was thrilled with her response she says that she will not cease to campaign for more female characters. She told Today: 'It was really, really cool.

"Samsung's Galaxy S6 is expected to appear in a radical Edge version with curved screens when it is unveiled on Sunday. However, new reports claim the ground breaking handset could be prohibitively expensive - and that Samsung is struggling to make the screen. Both phones will be revealed at a special event in Barcelona before the Mobile World Congress begins there on Monday. Scroll down for video . The firm has been showing off the curved screen in teaser adverts, but is believed to be struggling to manufacture them in large quantities. According to a source at one of Samsung's mobile carrier partners in Europe who spoke to Ars Technica under the condition of anonymity, Samsung is launching both the curved and normal Galaxy S6 at high price points. 'Our source, who has seen Samsung's new devices in person, tells us that the mid-level 64GB curved Galaxy S6 will cost carriers €949 ($1,076), with the top-end 128GB model priced at €1,049 ($1,189)—around €50 more expensive than the comparable iPhone 6 Plus.' The same source also said the firm is having yield issues for the curved display, which could mean the handset is in very short supply when it launches. For the non-curved Galaxy S6, European pricing is €749 ($849), €849 ($963), and €949 ($1,076) for the 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB models respectively - $100 cheaper than the curved version. The site warns that these high prices could dent the phone's popularity. 'The pricing of both the normal and curved versions of the Galaxy S6, however—if carriers pass the price hike onto consumers—could be problematic unless the hardware is truly sensational.' Samsung is set to unveil the handset in Barcelona on March 1st. The Galaxy Edge will have curved screens on each side, and the Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. Created by designes Ivo Marić and Jermaine Smit, the new renders show both expected versions - a standard one and an 'Edge' with both sides having curved displays. Both phones are also expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. And the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge. However, the S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right-handed mode . Users will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them. Both phones are also expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens. The handsets are also set to include wireless charging capabilities. And now the Korean firm has heavily implied the device - or multiple new devices - will come with wireless charging built-in. Many current phones need specially-designed cases and accessories to charge wirelessly, but Samsung's next-generation models could add the feature within the handset on a single chip. In a blog post by Seho Park, principal engineer in Samsung Electronics' IT and mobile division wrote: '2015 will be a landmark year for the growth of wireless charging. The S6 is expected to look similar to Apple's iPhone 6 handset . It will also include a rumoured 20 megapixel camera . Previous leaks said the Galaxy S6 will feature a Quad HD 5.5-inch display. Other reports claim the screen will measure a smaller 5.1 inches. It is expected to have an octa-core processor and 16MP rear-facing camera. More recent rumours suggest the firm will also unveil an Edge version of its flagship phone. The S6 Edge is said to have a curved screen that covers both sides. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. And the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Note Edge. However, the S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode. The use of the plural  'smartphones' in Samsung's latest blog post adds weight to these claims. Elsewhere, this post heavily implies the devices will have wireless charging built in. Both handsets are expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress on 1 March. 'With our upcoming Galaxy smartphones, users will be able to enter a new wireless world like never before.' The use of the plural 'smartphones' adds further weight to the fact Samsung will unveil at least two handsets at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March. These are expected to be the Samsung Galaxy S6, and the S6 Edge that is rumoured to have a curved screen that covers both sides. Until now, many phones and other products have predominantly used the 'magnetic-inductive' method of charging. This involves pairing a device with a dock and is used from phones to electric toothbrushes and shavers. There are three wireless charging organisations including the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), and its Qi standard, the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) and the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP). Samsung is a member of all three groups. This means that manufacturers have to choose which standard they use, and not every standard is supported across different charging points, for example. However, last year, components that support multiple standards on a single chip were released and in January, the PMA and A4WP announced they would join forces to offer better wireless charging features. The S6 won't be the first phone to have wireless charging built in - the Nokia Lumia 920 already offers this feature - but the Lumia 920 runs on the Qi standard.

Samsung's next Galaxy phones are, however, expected to be the first to support multiple standards on a built-in chip. This means they will be more versatile to take advantage of public charging ports being introduced across retailers such as McDonalds and Starbucks. It will also beat main rival Apple to introducing the technology. Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its original curved device. The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it. The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts. The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example. Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. The use of the plural 'smartphones' in the blog post adds further weight to the fact Samsung will unveil at least two handsets at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March. Samsung's invite (pictured) hints at a curved device and the firm is expected to announced the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge . The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart. 'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi.

"A millionaire who built a 10,000sq ft leisure centre in his garden for his family with a 16-seat cinema, squash court, casino, bar and bowling alley has been told he must pull it down. Graham Wildin, 62, spent more than a year constructing what is described as Britain's most 'elaborate play pad' but has been involved in a row with his local council after he told them: 'As far as I am concerned, I don't need planning permission'. The leisure-centre style complex also features a 25ft tall, three-storey doll's house, a soft play area and indoor tennis and badminton courts, and was dug down 18ft into the ground to avoid obstructing neighbours' views of the Gloucestershire countryside. Legal battle: Millionaire accountant Graham Wildin, 62, has been told he must pull down a leisure centre, which includes a bowling alley, built for his family in his garden . Struggle: Mr Wildin said the structure, pictured, did not require planning permission but the local council disagree and want it demolished . But planners from Forest of Dean District Council say the luxury extension at the back of his six-bedroom home in Cinderford, Gloucestershire, must be demolished. Today Mr Wildin has been given two years to destroy the structure after failing in his appeal against an enforcement notice. The planning inspectorate ruled that the building is a 'bulky structure' and 'totally out of scale and proportion with the surrounding development.' He declined to comment today but when he launched his appeal he insisted he had meticulously followed planning laws to avoid intruding on neighbours. Mr Wildin, who runs an accountants based in Lydney, Gloucestershire, said: 'As far as I am concerned, I don't need planning permission as I have permitted development rights and I had this designed to take advantage of those rights, so I am within the law and I still consider that to be the case. 'This is for my family. I have three children and five grandchildren; I love them to bits and they come to my home on a regular basis. I have lived here for 32 years.' Grand: The 10,000sq ft structure was branded Britain's most 'elaborate play pad' and contains a casino for family and friends to use . Argument: The 62-year-old said the centre was not bothering anyone and that he had built it for his grandchildren. He is pictured in the 16-seat cinema . Grand: Table tennis, badminton and tennis are among the activities Mr Wildin had in mind when building the impressive structure for his family . Mr Wildin, 62, has maintained that he did not think he needed permission when he started construction. 'This is my family home,' he said. 'All my children and my grandchildren come to visit, it's the place they all go. 'If all this fuss hadn't been kicked up nobody would know it was there. 'I have spoken to all my neighbours and none are bothered. They have all written letters of support to the council.' But not all neighbours were happy with the development. Andrew Buckmaster, 59, whose house is immediately next door to the bowling alley part of the extension, was the only one to lodge a formal objection with the council. He said the decision to tear it down was 'brilliant'. 'It should come down and go back to a garden,' he said. 'But why did the council allow it to be built in the first place? People told them. 'I don't think he will take it down. He is going to build a house in front of it, which he has planning permission for, so how will they be able to get back there and take it down?' Angry: Neighbour Andrew Buckmaster, 59, said: 'It should come down and go back to a garden. Why did the council allow it to be built?' Triumph: Mr Buckmaster, whose house is next to the bowling alley part of the extension, said the decision to tear it down was 'brilliant' Modern: A state-of-the-art gym has also been installed in the complex in the complex which has taken almost a year to complete since breaking ground . The soft play area for his five grandchildren as it was being built over the past year. Mr Wildin spent months working on the property and maintains it is all unfair 'fuss' Fun house: As well as a cinema room, the accountant built a games room with plush leather sofas, a table-football game and chess boards . These include, but are not limited to: . A five-metre tall wall stands about a metre and a half from the side of Mr Buckmaster's house, where he has lived for seven years. The plumber added: 'When my neighbour started the project he told me it was not going to exceed 2.5 metres in height. 'He erected the steel and came and stood by me and looked up and said ""that does exceed 2.5 metres doesn't it?"". 'Today two men appeared and went to work on a back wall. The brickie said he has two more weeks' work to do.' Mr Buckmaster told the council he was unhappy about the clatter of the pins in the bowling alley. 'At night, it is one of the quietest places you could live,' he said. 'But the other night he had a practice with his skittle alley and it sounded like it was in my house.' Mr Wildin – who refuses to disclose how much the development has cost – said he wanted his family to be able to watch a movie, play roulette and go bowling without leaving home. 'If you look at the building from the street you can't see it at all,' he said. 'You can maybe just see a fence. You'd have to be in a helicopter to see it. 'I looked at the rules permitting development before I started. They are very generous rules. There are five steps that must be adhered to, and this qualified in all of those. I built it to take advantage of all those things.' Mr Wildin has purchased the bungalow next door and is planning more works on his land. The enforcement notice issued by Forest of Dean District Council states: 'The construction of walls and the erection of a building on the area of land which has been excavated is harmful to the residential amenity of the surrounding land in terms of the overbearing impact of a physical structure and the level of impact from the uncontrolled use of the building.' Construction: Mr Wildin dug out 9,000 tonnes of soil from his back garden to make room for the building and maintains that it is not imposing to neighbours . Complaint: Only one neighbour complained because he was unhappy with the height of the complex – and the clatter of the pins in the bowling alley . One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'I've got no issue with him and get on really well with him. 'To be fair, the lorries have been a bloody nightmare - the traffic and whatever. I can see why the people living immediately next door have got major issues. People think that maybe he thinks he can possibly do what he wants, but I'm not going to slaughter him. 'I don't know if it's jealousy - I don't know. People were signing a petition to get it taken down. 'A neighbour the other day said to me 'has he got his comeuppance' but he works hard - he's up at 5am and not done till five or six at night. 'I just can't see him knocking it down. Is he going to pay the same men to take it down as put it up?'","Graham Wildin built the impressive entertainment complex in his garden for his five grandchildren to enjoy .

"When you think of you think of your typical fitness instructor you can't help but picture a super-slim Lycra wearing gym bunny. But Charlotte Clarke, 38, who runs an aerobics fitness class in Chiswick, west London, is making us reconsider that stereotype, tipping the scales at 18 and a half stone. The super-sized instructor is helping other lose weight and even says her clients like her more than her slimmer counterparts because she's not 'preachy'. Scroll down for video . Charlotte Clarke, pictured taking  her Jungle Body class in West London, is Britain's fattest fitness instructor and says her clients feel more comfortable with her because she is not 'preachy' Charlotte has already lost five stone herself and continues to lose weight with her classes . Charlotte once weighed more than 23st and was so heavy that she couldn't walk up stairs without getting out of breath. But now she leads her Jungle Body class with aplomb, despite being a size 20 with a BMI of 41.4 - making her technically obese. Bubbly Charlotte reckons being big like her clients makes them feel more comfortable during classes and therefore they'll shed more weight in her once a week class. She said: 'When people see me, they don't expect me to be fit. I want people to realise that you can still be overweight and healthy at the same time. 'For a big girl, going to the gym is a nightmare. You're surrounded by slim girls in Lycra - it can be very demoralising. 'When I started getting fit I would stand at the back of the class so no one could see my booty and I refused to lift my arms high so no one would see my bingo wings. Charlotte's clients look like they are having fun whilst taking the class with her . Charlotte decided to lose weight herself after being told by her doctor that she was incredibly unhealthy . Charlotte had piled on the pounds after gorging on jars of peanut butter and huge family sized meals . 'Some of the moves I simply had to avoid altogether because my fat would get in the way.' Charlotte, who has not had any children, had her own wake-up call when she visited her GP because she had a sky-high blood pressure and was experiencing pains in her joints. She said: 'He told me I was morbidly obese and had to lose weight otherwise I would start to experience even more health problems. That was a real wake-up call.' Charlotte had ballooned to a massive size 26 by gorging herself on jars of peanut butter and massive portions - often enough to feed an entire family. Since deciding to become healthy, Charlotte has ditched meat and adopted a balanced, pescetarian diet. Charlotte looks energetic as she takes her class in West London, she says she wants people to realise you can be fat and healthy at the same time . Charlotte leads the class as they do their stretches during her class . She said: 'I ate whatever I felt like, that was the problem. Peanut butter on toast with bananas on top was my weakness - and I would skip breakfast, which was naughty. 'I wasn't a complete pig all day but I would be eat a big dinner and keep snacking throughout the night. 'Portion control for sure was a problem - the size of my dinners just spiraled out of control.' Single Charlotte managed to shed four and a half stone using a balance of healthy eating and gym exercise and launched her Boogieful classes in October last year. She teaches The Jungle Body, dance fitness classes that claims to burn up to 700 calories in an hour. Charlotte sweats it out with her clients during the work out class - she said that going to the gym as a big girl is a nightmare . Charlotte says the class is really fun because her clients get to dance around and feel like they are Beyonce . Charlotte, who works in accounts, said: 'It's a lot of fun. It's like Zumba bit a bit more up to date. We dance around to hip hop and pretend we are Beyonce. 'I want to help plus size women get fitter and more confident and enjoy the class as part of a healthier lifestyle.' Charlotte is still losing weight all the time, thanks to her exercise classes and balanced, healthy diet. She added: 'I've decided to eat little and often and don't skip breakfast - I start the day with porridge with blueberries and strawberries. 'Then late morning I have a piece of fruit. For lunch, brown rice and fish. Then I have another snack, a handful of nuts or something. Then for my dinner I don't eat carbs - I stick to fish. 'And I don't have much peanut butter at all now. But when I have a craving I will just have a spoonful.'","Charlotte Clarke, 38, is Britain's tips the scales at 18 and a half stone .

"A public-spirited father was fined for his kindness as he reunited a lost terrier with its owner - because he unknowingly waited on playing fields from which dogs were banned. Marc Harrison spotted the missing pet, called Bobby, wandering the streets of Heysham, Lancashire and found a number for the owner on its  collar. But after arranging to meet the owner in a nearby playing field, Mr Harrison was approached by dog wardens who quickly handed him an £85 penalty fine. Marc Harrison was left furious after he was handed a fine by 'horrible' dog wardens as he waited to return a lost terrier to its rightful owner . Mr Harrison said: 'I feel penalised for doing the right thing. I was worried it might get knocked over. I called the phone number on the collar but couldn't get an answer at first. 'I was only there two or three minutes and I'd just got through to the owner when the dog wardens came on and said ""you can't walk your dog there"". 'They were quite horrible about it. I was never given the opportunity to explain myself. Now I've got to pay £85 and I feel like I did the dog wardens' jobs for them.' Mr Harrison had been walking with partner Zara, nine-month-old son Rupert, and his own dog Edard when he saw the lost animal running free. His partner took Rupert and Edard to their car, while Mr Harrison called the number on the dog's collar. He said he did not realise dogs were banned from the  site because he was not local to the area and so waited there for the owner to turn up and retrieve their pet. He said: 'I don't live down there so I didn't know it was restricted walking. I didn't want to put the dog in the car with Rupert so I walked over to a nearby field. 'I said ""this is ridiculous"". I had the baby in my arms so I left the dog with them and walked off.' Owner Robert Claxton has backed Mr Harrison's explanation and called on Lancaster City Council to overturn the fine. The terrier,  Bobby, had run away from its disabled owner's house when a visitor arrived at the front door . Mr Claxton, who is disabled, said his dog Bobby had run out of the house into the road as his carer came through the door. He said: 'I'd like to thank Mr Harrison and why they have charged him I don't know. 'I didn't know that he had been fined. The dog wardens know me, they told me everything was all right. 'He was only in that field because it was the easiest place for me to pick Bobby up. I'd go to court and vouch for him if need be.' Lancaster City Council said: 'The council is unable to comment on the specifics of individual cases. 'King George's Field is leased by a youth football club, who have previously experienced a persistent problem with dog fouling that was severely affecting their use of the field. 'The field has been recently fenced off, which has resulted in it becoming a dog exclusion area.' Mr Harrison said he was unaware of the rules as he is not from the area and was concerned with looking after his son, Rupert, and the dog he was helping to retrieve at the time .","Father found missing terrier running free in Heysham, Lancashire .

"Ever wondered what your offspring actually sees while being pushed around in their buggy? Well, one family visiting New York got to find out after they strapped a GoPro camera to their son's pram - producing an incredible tot's-eye view of the city. Diego Acosta López, 32, spent more than five weeks studying in the city and captured everything his one-year-old son Ignacio saw from his seat when he arrived for a holiday. Scroll down for video . Raining at Radio City...but little Ignacio, aged one, still got a great view of one of New York's most iconic entertainment venues. Above shows the snap captured by the GoPro camera attached to his buggy . The tot's pram provided an original vantage point on one of the world's most photographed cities... and Ignacio enjoyed his sightseeing tour with a Buzz Lightyear toy by his side . When the digital photography student, visiting from Quito in Ecuador, looked back at what the 'pramera' had caught, he found a stunning array of snapshots, perfectly capturing the Big Apple's iconic sights from a fresh perspective. Among the slideshow of sights were shots of a damp-looking Times Square - pictured through the buggy's raincover; Central Park in all its tree-lined splendour and a shot of a commuter dozing off on the Subway. Little Ignacio even got a glimpse of New York's famous billboards, with a denim-clad female model clearly caught through the lens. Snap-happy Dad Diego received a grant from the Ecuadorian government to help him study for a master's degree in digital photography at the School of Visual Arts in New York - moving away from his native Ecuador to study. He started the series when his family came to visit him in New York for the first time. Mum Paola (left with a snoozing passenger) passes Ignacio some much needed snacks while riding the New York Subway. Parents Diego and Paulo (pictured right) took the images while Diego was studying in the city . Diego said: 'I first visited New York in 2007 and felt a strong connection to the city. I loved the visual richness of Manhattan... along with all of the cultural places. 'During one class my teacher, James Estrin, suggested I put the camera inside the chair so I just set up it and I gave it a lot of rides. 'I found that the GoPro is a wonderful tool to document everything you want - it is easy to handle and it adapts to everywhere. He added that the project wasn't technically difficult but finding the perfect position for the camera was trickier. 'The time was challenging - trying to choose the best images in the most iconic places and at the same time dealing with classes and the rest of other final projects was tough. 'It's hard to choose my favourite, but I feel that the image where Ignacio is looking at an empty box of chocolates and the background is this beautiful view of a forest with reflections over the lake is incredible. 'It gives life from a child's perspective - he only cares about the chocolate and not the view or even the park - he just want more chocolate. Central Park's beautiful foliage is enticing but Ignacio seems more interested in the chocolate wrapper that he's holding. Dad Paulo said: 'He only cares about the chocolate and not the view or even the park.' More inclement weather in Times Square means Ignacio sees the bright lights of Manhattan's most famous tourist spot through a plastic cover . Sights and sounds: The GoPro captures a marching band of New York drummers passing by with sparkling tree lights in the background . No-one is safe from US advertising: New York's huge billboards, featuring a beautiful model, are snapped by the pram camera . Diego said: 'The pushchair series was my final project for the editorial art class. Last semester, I was trying to tell the relationship between my son, Ignacio, and his first experience of visiting New York. 'At the beginning of this project my images were from outside the pushchair but I felt that the story was not strong enough. 'Most of the viewers have liked the images for their unique and original point of view. 'They give a truly unique perspective and I think that the images get people inside the pushchair too. 'I also believe that parents mainly love the images because now they know how their children perceive the world.'","Art student Diego Acosta López, 32, fixed camera to son Ignacio's pram .

"High-stakes slot machines where gamblers can place bets of up to £100 are a form of 'onanism' compared to the 'full sexual intercourse' of betting on horses, a Labour peer has claimed. Lord Lipsey mocked users of so-called Fixed Odds Betting Terminals as 'sad-eyed blokes' who sit in front of 'porn-like' machines while 'shoving in pounds for momentary pleasure'. The extraordinary remarks came in a House of Lords debate on banning the machines, and sparked claims from a minister that he was turning the subject into 'Fifty Shades of Betting Shops'. Labour peer Lord Lipsey compared betting on racing to the 'momentary pleasure' of using high stakes betting machines . The spread of the machines has sparked alarm among campaigners who warn they are fuelling problem gambling and anti-social behaviour. There are thought to be more than 30,000 FOBT machines in the UK. The machines, which feature games such as roulette, blackjack and poker, have a maximum payout of up to £500. Users can bet up to £100 every 20 seconds and in 2013, some £1.6 billion was lost by gamblers on FOBTs in Britain. In a debate in the Lords, several peers called for a crackdown on their use including capping the amount users can bet. But in his speech Lord Lipsey launched into what he described as a 'rather racy analogy' to describe how he is 'not very fond' of the gambling machines. 'If betting on a horse race is the full sexual intercourse of betting and gambling, with foreplay when you select your horse and mounting excitement as the race goes on - we know what happens after that, when the result comes - then FOBTs are a form of onanism. 'You see sad-eyed blokes - it is always blokes - in front of porn-like machines, made very glittery and unrealistic, shoving in pounds for momentary pleasure.' He went on: 'If FOBTs evaporated into the air tomorrow, I for one should be delighted but that does not mean that I would ban them. 'There are a lot of pastimes that I do not much like: fox hunting, shooting and fishing. 'However, if others wish to practise them within the law - and of course on fox hunting there is a strict law - that is their affair.' Foxed odds betting machines, which feature games such as roulette, blackjack and poker, have a maximum payout of up to £500 . Tory frontbencher Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth later joked his 'contribution seemed to turn into 'Fifty Shades of Betting Shops'. Councils are among those calling for tough new powers to tackle 'clustering' of betting shops and reduce the risks from FOBTs which have been dubbed the 'crack cocaine' of gambling. They say the current £100-a-spin maximum stake should be brought in line with maximum stakes for other gambling machines, which is £2 in pubs and £5 in casinos. Lord Lipsey insisted that everything must be done to 'stop the terrible affliction that genuine addictive problem gambling can do to people and their families'. He added: 'As far as I am concerned, it is not those who shove every penny they can get hold of into these damned machines who are the only people with a gambling problem. 'Anyone who stuffs a hard-earned £100 into a slot has a gambling problem. You therefore have to tackle it across the board.'","Lord Lipsey mocks men using 'porn-like' machines in betting shops .

"Motorists are being charged at least $2 extra per tank according to new analytics that reveal petrol retailers are overcharging Australian drivers at the gas pumps. A three year examination by the Australian Automobile Association found that the average retail petrol margin for unleaded across the country has grown by 35 per cent since 2012. 'Retailers have been quietly and steadily lifting their margins while the retail price is low,' AAA Acting Chief Executive James Goodwin told Daily Mail Australia. A three year analysis of the petrol market by the Australian Automobile Association found that the average retail petrol margin for unleaded across the country has grown by 35 per cent since 2012 . 'We're deeply concerned that the full impact of lower international oil prices has not been passed on to motorists in full. 'It's very simple; prices have not been as low as they should have been. An average driver has been paying about an extra $2 a tank more than they would have if margins had stayed at 2012 levels.' The analysis revealed that in the 12 month period ending February 12, 2012, the unleaded retail petrol margin was 8.9 cents per litre. This year, in the week ending February 8, the 12-month average retail petrol margin was found to be 12.3 cents per litre. However average weekly margins have reached as high as 18 cents per litre in the periods of June and July in 2012, while in the last few months they have been sitting at about 15 cents per litre. An average driver has been paying about an extra $2 a tank more than they would have if margins had stayed at 2012 levels . 'A motorist in a passenger vehicle travelling the average annual distance (13,200 km) using the average annual fuel consumption (11.1L/ 100km) will be paying nearly $50 more than they would had margins remained at 2012 levels,' the report by AAA stated. 'We're deeply concerned that the full impact of lower international oil prices has not been passed on to motorists in full,' AAA Acting Chief Executive James Goodwin said . 'A motorist driving Australia's top-selling car, the Toyota Corolla, is paying $1.87 per tank more than they would had average margins remained at 2012 levels. 'People driving a Holden Commodore are paying an additional $2.41, while those driving a Ford Ranger are paying $2.72 more than they would have in 2012.' Diesel margins have also been significantly high, recorded at 24 cents per litre in the last six months before settling to 11.1 cent per litre recently. 'Every little bit helps for most drivers and they will be annoyed to learn that they have been paying about three cents a litre more than they should have been,' Mr Goodwin said. The findings come after Minister Bruce Billson appointed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to monitor and analyse the prices and profits of the fuel market to provide greater transparency.","Australian Automobile Association found the average retail petrol margin for unleaded across the country has grown by 35 per cent since 2012 .

Mirjana Puhar, 19, her boyfriend, Jonathan Cosme Alvarado, 23, and a friend, Jusmar Isiah Gonzaga-Garcia, 21, were found shot inside a home in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday. Puhar, who moved to the U.S. from Serbia with her family to escape the Kosovo War when she was five, appeared on the 21st cycle of the reality TV show but was eliminated in the 10th episode. Emmanuel Jesus Rangel, 19, has been arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths, which police say were drug related, the Charlotte Observer reported. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Mirjana Puhar, pictured last August, has been found killed in the home she shared with her boyfriend and a friend in Charlotte, North Carolina. She appeared on America's Next Top Model last year . Police say the victims and their killer knew each other. Puhar had just moved in with Alvarado and Gonzaga-Garcia, TMZ reported. Authorities said they found the bodies after a tip from a 'source'. They have not said how the victims died but TMZ reported that the bodies were found after gunshots were heard. On Wednesday, a friend confirmed the news on Puhar's Instagram page. 'It has been confirmed,' the friend, Chelsea, wrote just before 11am. 'Everyone keep family and friends in prayer. Everything is still under investigation. Thank you.' The message was later removed from the page. Rangel has also been charged in a separate murder that occurred on Sunday morning. He is one of three people charged in connection with a homicide at a motel in Matthews, police said. Authorities responded to reports of a shooting at 1am at the Microtel Hotel and found two men with gun wounds inside a car. Model: She is pictured in images on her Instagram, including with Tyra Banks, the creator of the show . Star: She appeared on the 21st cycle of the show, which aired last year, but left in the 10th week . One man, Rosool Jaleel Harrell, 22, was dead and the other had suffered life-threatening injuries. 'We don't know for sure' if the two cases are related, Matthews police Officer Tim Aycock told the Observer. 'It's very suspicious that the same guy is charged.' Arrest: Emmanuel Rangel, 19, has been charged with their deaths and another murder on Sunday . He was arrested without incident on Wednesday morning, police said. Rangel was charged with first-degree murder in that case, along with Edward Sanchez, 19. Another teenager, Emily Ann Isaacs, 18, was charged with accessory after fact. Mirjana was 18 when she appeared on the reality TV show, which aired last year, and was eliminated from the show in the 10th episode. The Serbian native was five when she moved to the U.S. with her family during the Kosovo War. With about $50 to their names, her parents ended up in New York City before moving to North Carolina around 10 years ago, she told the Charlotte Observer in an interview last year. She dropped out of high school and worked different jobs, including at McDonald's, before becoming a model. 'I was a wild child,' she told the Observer in the interview. 'I went out, had fun, partied, whatever – I didn't really have the best influences around me.' But she decided to head back to school and completed her GED at a community college just before starting on America's Next Top Model. She was the youngest contestant taking part in last year's show. While on the show, she became close to a male model on the series - but he is not the man who was found killed on Tuesday. After news of her death, the show's winner, Keith Carlos, tweeted: 'I Love You @mirjanapuhar #RIP' 'We are deeply saddened to learn of the tragic news about Mirjana Puhar. She was a vivacious and promising young woman,' Banks and fellow executive producer Ken Mok said in a statement. 'Our hearts and prayers go out to her loved ones.' Top Model judge Miss J Alexander also tweeted following the tragic news, writing; 'Saddened to learn about #ANTM Cycle 21 contestant Mirjana Puhar's murder. Remembering her fondly. RIP' Scene: Police swarmed the house on Norris Avenue after the three people were found dead on Tuesday .","Mirjana Puhar, who appeared in the show last year, was found dead on Tuesday afternoon with her boyfriend, 23, and a friend, 21, at their home .

"From children working hard in the fields to a group of soldiers pushing a broken-down bus, these are the photographs that North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, didn't want you to see. Taken by photographer Eric Lafforgue during what would prove to be his final visit to the rogue state, the images reveal the shocking extent of the deprivation suffered by the people who live there. Lafforgue, who has now been banned from North Korea, took the pictures while in the company of state-approved guides and was asked to delete each of the images but managed to save them on his memory card. Scroll down for video . Multi-purpose: . 'The North Korean army is said to be one of the most important in the . world. But if you travel there, you’ll often see soldiers doing menial . tasks' Unamused: . 'The officials hate it when you take this kind of picture. Even when I . explained that poverty exists everywhere, they still forbade me from . taking them' Child . labour: 'When times are hard (as they usually are here), children can . be found working for the farming collectives,' explains Lafforgue . Shocking: 'North Korean officials forbid you to photograph anyone suffering from malnutrition like this man or this little boy' Not . allowed: It is forbidden to take pictures of North Korean people if . they are not well dressed. For my guide this man was not well dressed . enough to be photographed' Scraps: . 'I spotted these kids collecting maize grains in the streets near . Begaebong,' explains Lafforgue of this surreptitious shot . Fascinatingly, . not all show the poverty that the North Korean leadership is so keen to . hide. Others offer a glimpse of the country's bomb shelter tube stations, dilapidated . buildings and draconian clothing regulation. Others . show children smiling and laughing beneath portraits of Kim Jong Un and . his father Kim Jong Il - an act considered incredibly disrespectful by . the regime. 'Every . visitor is warned not to take photos without the consent of the guides . as soon as they arrive in Pyongyang,' explains Lafforgue. 'But in . reality, it's impossible for them to monitor everything, especially when . travelling with groups. 'They . insist that you don't take photos of anything to do with the military . and anything that could suggest poverty - even when you explain to them . that it exists all over the world and even in France. 'In . Pyongyang, as only the elite is allowed to live there, you don't see . real poverty but as soon as you get out into the countryside, it's a . completely different story.' Unique: . 'A woman standing in the middle of a crowd of soldiers. This picture . was not supposed to be taken as officials do not allow pictures of the . army' Break-down: . North Korea is touchy about images showing the military. 'You see this . all the time in North Korea, but aren't allowed to take pictures,' says . Lafforgue . No . photos! 'Taking pictures in the demilitarised zone (between North and . South Korea) is easy, but if you come too close to the soldiers, they . stop you' Not . allowed: Taking photos of soldiers relaxing, such as this photograph of . two men enjoying a sneaky cigarette, is not allowed in North Korea . Bizarre: . 'When visiting the dolphinarium in Pyongyang, you are allowed to . photograph the animals, but not the soldiers who make up 99 per cent of . the crowd!' Enraged: . The North Korean regime hates photos that show soldiers resting. 'This . picture really contributed to me getting banned from the country,' says . Lafforgue . But even . in Pyongyang, signs of poverty are all too apparent. Images that reveal . the extent of the regular power shortages, which the regime blames on . 'American imperialists', and the crumbling interiors of the outwardly . well-maintained apartment blocks speak clearly of deprivation. In the countryside, the sight of people picking grass and children working in the fields are regular occurrences. 'The guides tell you that they [the children] work in . the fields in the same way that teenagers here have summer jobs,' adds Lafforgue. 'The . difference is that in Europe they are paid, while in North Korea, it is a collective . duty. I must say that they always seemed . ""happy"" and didn't appear to be miserable. But the gap between poverty and . patriotic enthusiasm is a narrow one.' In . a bid to prevent visitors from capturing photos deemed 'unacceptable' by the regime, state minders often attempt to confiscate the cameras . owned by their charges. Cold . shower: A man bathes in the river in the countryside outside Pyongyang. 'Once you get into rural areas, this sort of thing is very common,' says Lafforgue . Fishing: . 'This man was using an old tyre for a boat. In the countryside, people . often fish in small lakes - it's a way to get fresh food in remote areas . where it's rare' Hunger: 'My camera was confiscated for the duration of the bus trip to Chongjin which suffered in the famine. Once I saw the people in the street, I understood why' Snooze: 'This man was taking a rest by the sea in Chilbo. My guide asked me to delete this for fear that Western media would say this man was dead. He was alive' Poverty: . 'In Kaesong near the demilitarised zone, you are locked in an hotel . complex made of old houses. The guides say it's the same outside the . hotel. No, it’s not.' Not impressed: 'This kind of picture is widespread in the West. The caption often points out that North Koreans have to eat grass. The guides get furious if you take it' Duty: . 'People go to the country to do public projects. The regime used to see . shots like these as positive but now they know that we interpret this . as forced labour' No . flash: 'As we passed by these old buildings, the guides asked me not to . shoot with flash. The official reason was “to avoid scaring people”' Paranoia: . 'North Koreans are very paranoid. I was asked to delete the picture . since the guides were certain I would have said those people were . homeless - they were just resting' Forbidden: . The regime considers pictures showing smiles under portraits of the . leadership to be disrespectful. 'Never take a picture where you can see . people doing silly things in front of the Kim portraits,' says Lafforgue . Rare: . 'Although cars are becoming widespread in Pyongyang, peasants aren't . used to seeing them. Kids play in the middle of the road just like when . they didn't exist' Luxury: 'You can find all kinds of food and drink in Pyongyang’s two supermarkets. They even have Evian water but only the elite can shop there' Blackout: 'We were in Pyongyang art gallery when we experienced a power outage. When it happens, they tell you it’s because of the American embargo' Irritating: 'Perhaps the most ridiculous prohibition of all. When I took the picture, everyone yelled at me. Since the painting was unfinished, I couldn’t take the picture' Scared: . 'You are supposed to see fun at the Songdowon Children's Camp but some . come from the country and are scared of escalators which they’ve never . seen before' 'The best solution for the guides is to . confiscate our cameras,' says Lafforgue. 'On the way to Chonjin, a new town opened up to tourists . three years ago, they just took my cameras and put them in a . bag they kept. They can be very smart sometimes.' But despite their best efforts, Lafforgue did manage to take these photos and as a result, has been banned from returning to North Korea by regime officials. 'I was disappointed as I think I tried to . show more than just the clichés you hear about this country,' says Lafforgue of his travel ban. 'I was trying to speak to . people, let them talk, show they are not robots and that they have families and a lot of culture. 'I tried to document North Korea in the same way I would any other country in the world, but for them to accept it, you really need to follow their rules and for me, some of those rules just weren't acceptable.' Odd: . 'Officials took issue with this photo for two reasons: The teen is . wearing his cap in a strange way (according to my guide), and there are . soldiers in the background' Multipurpose: . 'Pyongyang’s subway system is the deepest in the world as it doubles as . a bomb shelter. I was told to delete this photo because it includes the . tunnel' Smarten . up! 'The way you dress is very important in North Korea. When I asked . to take a picture of these students, the girl insisted that the man . straighten his shirt' Ridiculous: . 'When you visit families, the guides love it if you take photos to show . that kids have computers. But when they see there's no power, they ask . you to delete!' Exhausted: . 'You see a lot of tired people on the roadside, since many have to ride . their bikes for hours to get to work. Taking pictures of them is . forbidden.' Eking . a living: Although the regime has cracked down on the black market, the . 'grey market', to which officials turn a blind eye, allow some to . scratch a living . Reparation: . 'North Korea says foreign aid is a war debt, but taking photos of the . WFP sign through the window of a house in a village is forbidden' Tough: . 'A rare example of an undisciplined kid in North Korea. The bus was . driving in the small roads of Samijyon in the north, when this boy stood . in the road' Patient: . 'Queuing is a national sport for North Koreans,' says Lafforgue. This . photo shows people waiting for a chance to catch the bus to work .

"A probe has been launched after a  passenger jet flew from  New York to Stockholm despite four cabin crew members refusing to fly because they felt it was unsafe to take off in a snowstorm. The Norwegian Airlines flight with 196 passengers on board arrived safely in Stockholm on January 26 after cabin staff were reportedly involved in a heated argument with the pilot at John F Kennedy Airport in New York. Four of the nine cabin crew refused to fly, leaving just five staff on board the plane for the transatlantic crossing. New York airports, including JFK, have been hit by hug amounts of snow over the past month . The American crew members, who have since been suspended while an investigation is conducted, allegedly disobeyed the captain citing safety concerns during the snowstorm that had engulfed much of the eastern US. According to Swedish newspaper Expressen.se some flights had been cancelled on the date due to heavy now accumulating on plane wings. Norway's Civil Aviation Authority Luftfartstilsynet confirmed the airline is investigating the incident and is expected to produce a report on findings. A spokesperson for the authority told MailOnline Travel the minimum number of crew for that flight from New York should have been seven. The director of operations for Luftfartstilsynet Einar Schjolberg was also quoted in local media as saying the incident was a breach of regulations and unacceptable. However, Tomas Hesthammer, Norwegian's head of flight operations, told Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet that the legal minimum for a flight of 196 passengers is five crew. A Norwegian passenger jet flew from New York to Stockholm despite four members of the cabin staff walking out over safety fears . Mr Hesthammer told press: 'Norwegian made the Norwegian CAA aware of the incident immediately. At the same time, an internal investigation was started. 'What seems clear is that the four cabin crew chose not to follow the captain’s orders, and eventually left the plane. This is extremely unusual and it is very serious when cabin crew doesn’t obey the captain’s orders. 'It is he or she who has a full overview of the flight, weather conditions, etc in accordance with the Aviation Act, the captain is given great authority in relation to making decisions on board.' He added: 'The flight to Arlanda was a perfectly normal flight despite fewer cabin crew members on board than usual. It is correct that the captain chose to fly with five cabin crew. 'Flying with five cabin crew is not in line with an order which was given one month previously as a result of an EASA recommendation. It is in other words not a law to date, however, this is something we’re obviously in dialogue with the CAA about. 'The captain's decision to fly with five cabin crew, with 196 passengers, satisfies the basic requirement of having one cabin crew per 50 passengers. The investigation and our dialogue with the CAA will clarify what further actions will be taken.' Passenger Lii Hylander told Sweden's Expressen.se the pilot had been 'calm and collected' explaining to passengers that they would take off despite only having half the cabin staff. She said: 'Once we were in the air, the flight went just fine.'","Norwegian  jet with 196 passengers flew from New York to Stockholm .

Price, who is a mother of five to Harvey, Junior, Princess Tiaamii, Jett and Bunny will be competing for her third title as Mum of the Year, where as Hopkins, who is a mother of three to India, Poppy and Maximillan, has never before been shortlisted. Katie Price (left with three of her children) and Katie Hopkins (right with her children) have been been shortlisted for the Celebrity Mum of the Year Award as voted for by the public . As well as Price and Hopkins other mums taking pole position include Katie Piper, Abbey Clancy, X Factor winner Sam Bailey and TOWIE star Billie Faiers. This year it seems stars of the small screen have also stolen the nation's heart – with This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby and The Voice co-host Emma Willis both securing a top spot. Unlike previous editions, only two professional singers made the final cut, with the 2015 top ten completed by Girls Aloud's Kimberley Walsh and The Saturdays' Frankie Bridge. The lucky finalists combine for a grand total of 21 children. Katie Price  has been a mother the longest, with son Harvey aged 12, while Kimberley Walsh had her first child, son Bobby, just over 5 months ago. New mum Billie Faiers has also been nominated for the prestigious award . Both Abbey Clancy (left) and Frankie Bridge (right) are currently expecting their second babies - making them the only pregnant mums to make the shortlist . Both Abbey Clancy and Frankie Bridge are currently expecting their second - making them the only pregnant mums to make the shortlist. A sign of the times, 2015 has seen reality trump Royalty hands-down with The Duchess of Cambridge narrowly missing out after finishing in eleventh place. However the most shocking entry to the list has to go to Marmite mum Katie Hopkins who has previously angered Brits with her controversial approach to parenting. The ex-apprentice star has previously claimed to filter her children's friends according to their names but her antics have seemingly struck a chord with Brits. However, not everyone is thrilled with the decision with her nomination with many outraged members of the public taking to Twitter to express their disagreement. Kimberley Walsh had her first child, son Bobby,  5 months ago making her the newest mum to make the cut . Coleen Nolan's son Shane Richie Jnr tweeted: 'Sooo @KTHopkins has been nominated for mum of the year??? Is this a joke?? This pic says it all #baffled' Leanne McGiveron added: 'How can a mum who teaches her children dispicable traits to be prejudice etc be nominated for mum of the year.' However, despite some people's disapproval the list was chosen by the public rather than a professional panel, so the caustic business woman is obviously impressing some mothers. *Listed in alphabetical order . Starting today until Tuesday 3 March 2015, people can vote for the celebrity they think is the most deserving of the crown at icelolly.com.

"Lindsay Lohan is trying to use time on stage in London as part of community service for reckless driving, a lawyer will claim today. Prosecutor Terry White will tell a judge that the actress is attempting to claim credit for the time she spent performing in the West End production Speed The Plow last year. The 28-year-old had been ordered to carry out 240 hours of court-ordered community service, which she vowed to complete at the London-based charity Community Service Volunteers (CSV).

He will claim that on one day the actress was given six hours credit but that two of those hours were for a matinee performance of Speed The Plow, a further two were for an evening performance while two more hours were taken up with a meet-and-greet event afterwards. The lawyer will also point to a day when Miss Lohan was said to have completed community service between 11am and 3pm. According to Tmz he will say that a performance of the play started at 3pm on that day and that she would have been required to be at the theatre - six miles away from the CSV building - 35 minutes early.

No suspicious devices had been found on the plane following security searches at the airport meaning that it appeared the woman's claim had been a false alarm. SWAT officers also boarded the plane in front of terrified passengers, before all disembarked safely.

"Empty shell casings found near the body of a man Aaron Hernandez has been accused of fatally shooting and one removed from a rental car the former NFL star returned were fired from the same weapon, a police officer said in court on Wednesday. Microscopic examinations of the six shells, including five from the crime scene and one from a dumpster at a rental car agency, showed to a reasonable degree of ballistic certainty they were fired from the same unknown .45 caliber Glock handgun, Massachusetts State Police Sergeant Stephen Walsh testified. 'It's consistent with having been fired from a Glock,' Walsh, a ballistics expert, said repeatedly at Massachusetts Superior Court in Fall River, referring to several of the shell casings, as well as bullets recovered from the crime scene. Ex-Pats player Aaron Hernandez appears to check the time on the clock as he beside his attorney Charles Rankin, right, during his murder trial  in Fall River, Massachusetts on Wednesday . hayanna Jenkins, fiance of former football star returned to court on Wednesday after several days absence to support her fiancée . Investigators have not found the gun used to kill Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée. His body was found by a teenaged jogger on June 17, 2013, in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's house in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. Lloyd, 27, had been shot five times at close range. Also on Wednesday, prosecution witness Vanessa Sanchez took the stand. She told jurors that she and her boyfriend had met the football player and his fiancée, Shayanna, along with another couple at the South Street Cafe in Providence, Rhode Island on June 16 at 11pm - around four hours before Odin Lloyd was killed. Hernandez and Shayanna left around midnight, Miss Sanchez said. Providence is about a 30 minute drive from the couple's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Prosecutors contend Hernandez and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home about 2.30am, before driving him to the North Attleboro industrial area where his body was found. All three men have pleaded not guilty. Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was cut from the team shortly after being charged with Lloyd's murder in June 2013. He also faces various firearms charges . On Tuesday, a woman who cleaned Hernandez's home testified that his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, was visibly nervous and spent time on the telephone, looking out the window and crying after hauling away a large trash bag in the trunk of a car the day after Lloyd was killed. Hernandez faces a second trial later this year on separate charges that he killed two Cape Verdean men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012. Hernandez's lawyers have said their client is innocent.

"After releasing a slew of more exotic flavour combinations, the makers of Pot Noodle have dialled things down a notch with their latest flavour, the Sausage Casserole Pot Noodle. Departing from the realms of Sticky Rib, Brazilian BBQ Steak, Bombay Bad Boy, Jamaican Jerk and Piri Piri Chicken, makers Unilever were inspired by classic British supper for their latest creation. The new flavour will be launched in April 2015 and is accompanied by a £3m advertising campaign. Pot Noodle's newest flavour is a classic British suppertime staple, sausage casserole . Unilever marketing manager Monique Rossi said to The Grocer: 'Pot Noodle Sausage Casserole will appeal to both male and female consumers looking for a satisfyingly simple snack with excellent taste credentials.' Classic suppertime dish sausage casserole . As well as their fancier offerings, the student staple is famous for more conventional flavours such as Chicken and Mushroom, Original Curry and Beef and Tomato. Last year the brand worked with inventive celebrity chocolatier Paul A. Young, who devised the Marmite truffle, to launch Choc Noodle for 2014's National Chocolate Week. The flavour – will took only four minutes to make – consisted of noodles in a creamy chocolate sauce and bite-sized chunks of butter fudge, milk choc chips and maple-covered pecans for added crunch. A thoroughly British brand, Pot Noodle was established in 1979 in Wales. In 1992 the company introduced their famous sauce sachets to each pot. By 1995 around 300,000 Pot Noodles were being eaten every week. Hot Chicken Curry and Barbecue flavours arrived in 1996, which also saw the introduction of And Christmas limited-edition Turkey and Stuffing flavour . In 2000 Unilever acquired Pot Noodle as one of its brands, and kicked things off with the mighty King-size Pot Noodle. In 2002, the factory in Crumlin factory was producing 175 million pots per year. Pot Noodle’s spiciest flavour Bombay Bad Boy was launched in 2002. It is estimated that five Pot Noodles are being wolfed down every second. Posh Noodle made an appearance in 2003 with three Thai flavours: Oriental Sweet and Sour, Spicy Chicken and Spicy Chilli. The following year Seedy Sanchez Mexican Fajita pots were launched and Southern Fried Chicken was added in 2005. The strapline ‘Fuel of Britain’ was born in 2006. The brand’s new adverts featured a Pot Noodle mine in Crumlin, where a stream of ‘Noodle Fuel’ had been discovered by miners. The miners in the ad were the genuine Pot Noodle workforce. In 2008 Harrods in London sold a limited-edition luxury Pot Noodle. The swanky Poulet and Champignon flavour was £29.95 and proceeds went to Action against Hunger. Pot Noeldle, a Christmas Dinner flavour, was launched in Christmas 2010. The lid could even be used as a bauble. The Pot Noodle GTi range was launched in 2011 with three varieties: Chilli Beef, Spaghetti Bolognese and Chicken Tikka. Chilli Beef was added to the regular Pot Noodle range in March 2012. Piri-Piri Chicken flavour is currently the hottest Pot Noodle and was launched in 2013.

"A former prison guard, who was convicted for helping smuggle drugs into jail and illegally accessing the information of prisoners under her care, will be allowed to have her baby live with her behind bars. The Court of Criminal Appeal decided that 'appropriate arrangements were in place' at a rural Darwin correctional centre for the one-year-old boy to stay with his mother, Sarah Dawn Rudd, during her jail term which has increased to nine months, according to NT News. The 26-year-old will serve a five-year partially suspended sentence, which includes 12 months in home detention, after pleading guilty to 12 charges relating to her involvement in a drug and corruption syndicate while working as a guard at Berrimah prison in Darwin. Former prison guard Sarah Dawn Rudd (pictured with her partner and child), will be allowed to live with her one-year-old son during her nine months behind bars . A spokesperson for the Department of Correctional Services told Daily Mail Australia: 'The Commissioner of Correctional Services may authorise a female prisoner to care for her young babies in custody where it is considered to be in the best interests of the child and the management and security of the correctional centre is not threatened'. Rudd held the baby in her arms and breastfed while she faced trial in August, according to NT News. Crown prosecutor David Morters told the court that the correction centre boss Ken Middlebrook confirmed women with babies would be accommodated at the new jail, which was still under construction at the time. 'The new jail will support the provision of services to young children,' he said, according to NT News. The Alice Springs mother was found guilty of instructing an inmate's partner on how to sneak Cannabis into the prison. The 26-year-old will serve a five-year partially suspended sentence, which includes 12 months in home detention, after pleading guilty to 12 charges relating to her involvement in a drug and corruption syndicate while working as a guard at Berrimah prison in Darwin . She also ran messages between bikie prisoner Jared Davis and other prisoners, who were attempting to organise a drug ring inside the jail. Rudd was found to have illegally accessed confidential information from the Correction's database for Phillip Noel Kaye Rudd, who also supplied her with drugs, the ABC reports. Despite her lawyer, John Tippet QC, arguing that none of her actions resulted in any serious harm, Crown prosecutor David Morters said she had undermined the criminal justice system. Rudd and her partner, firefighter Anthony Butt, were both charged in May of 2013 for possessing steroids after returning from a trip to Thailand.

"Hillary Clinton, who has in past had trouble talking about her wealth and life experiences, is intensifying an effort to  humanize herself to likely voters. Clinton has increasingly made mention of her roles as both a mother and grandmother in remarks, framing her public policies in the context of the hardships she dealt with while raising only child Chelsea and the hopes and fears she has about the world her granddaughter Charlotte will inhabit. During a Tuesday speech in Silicon Valley, her first in the U.S. this year, Clinton indulged in self-deprecating humor. She casually joked about being overweight at the conference targeting women and teased that she might have a hoarding problem. Hillary Clinton cracks a smile during a keynote address at the Watermark Silicon Valley Conference for Women on Tuesday in Santa Clara, California. Clinton, who has in past had trouble talking about her wealth and life experiences,  used the appearance  to humanize herself to likely voters . Clinton, right, and interviewer Kara Swisher high-five during a conversation at the 'Lead On' conference for women on Tuesday. Clinton played to her audience at the event and stated that 'in many ways the economy is still operating like it's 1955.' She also chastised men who ignore women's issues . The much sought after public speaker earned an estimated $300,000, according to the New York Times, for her keynote at the Watermark Silicon Valley Conference for Women on Tuesday, where  attendees paid $245 a ticket to listen to Clinton and other female leaders. Clinton had been unusually quiet in the last several months before the Santa Clara, California, speech as she interviewed potential managers for her expected presidential campaign and revised her message. She'll make several appearances next week, however, at an Emily's LIST gala in Washington, D.C. and a dinner for her family's non-profit, the Clinton Foundation, and she'll participate in a Clinton Foundation event for students in Miami next weekend. Back in the spotlight on Tuesday, Clinton continued to play coy about her campaign rollout, telling interviewer Kara Swisher, co-executive editor of Re/code, that she would make a decision about her political future 'in good time.' 'I am obviously talking to a lot of people, thinking [it] through,' Clinton said, according to NBC News. 'Because here's my view on this, Kara: I just think that we have so many big issues we have to deal with that unless we can really come together and have a national conversations about those issues, we're not going to make the progress we need.' Playing to her audience Clinton stated that 'in many ways the economy is still operating like it's 1955,' and chastised men who ignore women's issues, saying to themselves, 'Act like you’re listening and this too shall pass.' 'I think we all cheered at Patricia Arquette's speech at the Oscars—because she's right, it's time to have wage equality once and for all,' she said, utilizing pop culture reference to make her point. about the wage gap between men and women. While advocating for paid leave for new mothers Clinton revealed that she waited to have a discussion with her own employer while pregnant with daughter Chelsea. Clinton worked at a law firm at the time, where she was a partner - the first female at the the firm to hold the title. 'I just kept getting bigger,' she said of how long it took her to broach the subject, according to San Jose Mercury news reporter Julia Love, who was present at the 'Lead On' event, which was not broadcast. The former first lady attempted to empathize with conference goers and showcase her own struggles with everyday issues while talking about her weight. 'You can tell I’m not doing Fitbit,' she said, referring to a popular wristwatch pedometer . The former first lady again attempted to empathize with conference goers, and showcase her own struggles with everyday issues, while talking about her weight. 'You can tell I’m not doing Fitbit,' she said, referring to a popular wristwatch pedometer. And when asked by Swisher whether she's an Android or Apple user, Clinton delicately sidestepped the question by again poking fun at herself. Clinton said she has an iPhone and a Blackberry. 'I don’t throw anything away,' she said. 'I’m like two steps short of a hoarder.' When it comes to serious matters such as foreign policy, Clinton's relied heavily on tenure as Secretary of State, during which time she traveled more often and to more countries than any of her predecessors, to convey an auro of  astuteness. Former Hewlett Packer executive Carly Fiorina, the only female Republican known to be seriously considering a presidential campaign in 2016, sunk her teeth into the talking point on Tuesday while speaking at an Atlanta, Georgia, luncheon, telling the event's Republican audience that frequent flyer miles don't count in presidential campaigns. 'Like Hillary Clinton, I too have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe,' Fiorina said, per an Associated Press report. 'But unlike Hillary Clinton, I know that flying is an activity, not an accomplishment.'","Clinton has had trouble in the past talking about her wealth .

"A sexually frustrated Indian man who tricked a woman he met on a dating site into have sex with him by pretending to be a blond Caucasian has narrowly avoided jail. Deepak Dhankar, 29, used photos of a muscular, blond stranger and adopted the name 'Jamie' for a dating profile he used to arrange a tryst with a Melbourne woman because he thought it would get him more hits. The married father of three was sentenced to a community corrections order in the Victoria County Court on Wednesday after pleading guilty to procuring sex by fraud after the woman discovered he was not who she thought he was. Deepak Dhankar, 29, used photos of a muscular, blond stranger and adopted the name 'Jamie' for a dating profile he used to arrange a tryst with a Melbourne woman . Dhankar, a financial planner, turned to online dating in 2012 after his third child was born and his wife became ill. In October that year he started chatting and exchanging explicit photos with the victim before they agreed to meet at her house for a sexual liaison. Dhankar let himself in through the unlocked door and entered the bedroom where the woman was naked and face-down on the bed. The two had agreed beforehand that 'Jamie' would play the role of a dominant and the woman would be a submissive. As part of that arrangement, Dhankar insisted she keep her eyes closed and never look at 'Jamie'. The woman consented to this and Dhankar performed sex acts on her while she lay on the bed. He then told her to go into her bathroom where their sexual activity continued until the woman's small child stirred. Married father of three was sentenced to a community corrections order in the Victoria County Court on Wednesday after pleading guilty to procuring sex by fraud . Dhankar started chatting and exchanging explicit photos with the victim before they agreed to meet at her house for a sexual liaison in October 2012 . When the woman went to settle her child, she saw Dhankar's hand and realised he was not the blond he'd described himself to be. She decided to play along because she was afraid of what might happen if she let on she was aware he wasn't 'Jamie'. In her victim impact statement, she told the court the incident left her feeling violated and she suffered crippling anxiety and panic attacks as a result. Judge Jane Patrick told Dhankar on Wednesday it was a serious matter to obtain access to another person's body by deception and had he not pleaded guilty she would have jailed him. 'It appears that you chose this extremely selfish, immature and inappropriate way to deal with your frustrations arising from the problems you and your wife were having,' Judge Patrick said. The judge questioned the wisdom of the woman's actions but said that did not diminish Dhankar's moral culpability. Dhankar was sentenced to a two-year order that requires him to perform 200 hours of community service.

"Earier this week MailOnline published shocking images of the moment a wife was held at knifepoint by her jealous, abusive husband. Now the victim, Susan Mills, 40, from Margate, Kent, has appeared on ITV show This Morning to speak about her terrifying ordeal. Recalling the events that led up to her husband, Glenn, attacking her with a knife, she said: 'He came back after being on bail for a month and started drinking with my daughter in the house. Scroll down for video . Susan Mills, 40, pictured on today's This Morning where she recalled the terrifying moment her husband of 21 years held her at knifepoint and she feared she would be killed . 'I told him not to drink, not to treat me like this and he just got worse and worse. 'I was scared for my life, I thought I was going to die.' Canterbury Crown Court heard last week how the couple, who had been together for 21 years, had argued over the parentage of their child. A neighbour - who photographed Glenn, 48, grabbing Susan around the neck and holding the knife against her before calling the police - said they heard him shout: 'If I'm going down, I'm going down for something worthwhile.' Susan is seen fighting for her life as her drunken husband Glenn wielded a knife in their back garden in this picture taken by a neighbour who then called the police . Susan said of this moment when armed Glenn held her round the neck: 'I thought I was going to die' The attack took place in their garden after Susan had ran outside in a desperate bid to escape her drunk and violent husband. She was able to break free of his clutches and then fled with her daughter to their neighbour's house until the police arrived. Glenn Mills has been sentenced to three years and eight months after pleading guilty assault by beating, affray and making threats to kill . Glenn was originally charged with attempted murder but on the day of his trial pleaded guilty to assault by beating, affray and making threats to kill. He was jailed for three years and eight months and the attempted murder charge was left on the file. The court heard how he had a previous conviction in October 2012 for battery on his wife when he fractured her fingers. Speaking on today's This Morning, Susan said these were the attacks that she had been brave enough to report. She told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford: 'For the first 16 years of our relationship there had been moments (of domestic violence) but I didn't have the guts or the courage to go to the police until 2010 when he locked me in room. 'The police had to break in and charged him with false imprisonment. However I later dropped these charges as I felt scared and guilty.' Susan explained how she met Glenn when she was 18 and they fell in love. She said their relationship 'wasn't all bad, we did have happy times' but he became increasingly jealous and controlling. Susan had fled to their garden to escape violent Glenn but he followed her wielding a knife, pictured . A court heard how Glenn said 'if I'm going down, I'm going down for something worthwhile', when he threatened Susan with a knife last year, pictured . 'He was really jealous of my friends, he told me I was ugly and fat and no other man would ever want me,' she said. She added that her mother always had reservations about her husband. 'She saw the signs, she didn't like Glenn at all. When this happened last year she cried her eyes out and said ""I can't believe he nearly killed you.""' Susan agreed to appear on ITV to share her story after a report published today revealed that domestic abuse victims suffer on average for three years before they get help. On today's This Morning, Susan told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford, right, that victims of domestic abuse should not 'put up with it' but seek help immediately . Some women suffer more than 50 incidents of abuse before it stops and almost a quarter of high-risk victims had to go to an A&E department because of their injuries. Susan hopes her story will encourage other victims not to delay in seeking help. She urged: 'My advice would be don't put up with it, people don't change, once they start hitting you and threatening you, they won't stop. Get out now and seek help. 'Go to the police. I'm 40 now and I feel like the last 20 years have been a waste.' She added that she's had counselling and her family have been a great support so she's now trying to move on with her life.","Susan Mills, 40, from Kent, suffered years of abuse from husband Glenn .

"HSBC chairman Douglas Flint told MPs he was 'very ashamed' by the bank's conduct . HSBC could face a criminal probe in the UK over claims that its Swiss private bank helped wealthy clients evade tax, it emerged yesterday. Investigations into the High Street banking giant have already been launched in France, Belgium, Switzerland and the US. Yesterday HMRC boss Lin Homer signalled that an inquiry into the scandal could now take place in Britain. She told MPs on the Treasury Committee a 'multi agency' meeting next week would assess if it was possible to 'pursue wider offences'. The Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Conduct Authority, Crown Prosecution Service, City of London Police, National Crime Agency and EU crime agency Eurojust would attend. The move paves the way for a criminal investigation in the UK into HSBC and its clients. HMRC has come under fire for prosecuting just one person from a list of 3,600 HSBC customers with Swiss bank accounts handed to it by French authorities in 2010. Yesterday Stuart Gulliver, HSBC’s chief executive since 2011, and chairman Douglas Flint were summoned to give evidence to the Treasury Committee. Appearing in public for the first time since the scandal emerged earlier this month, Mr Flint admitted the bank had ‘suffered horrible reputational damage’ and said he felt ‘very ashamed’ by what happened. HSBC has been rocked by a string of controversies, including PPI mis-selling, interest rate derivative mis-selling, foreign exchange manipulation and violation of international sanctions. Mr Flint said: 'It is a terrible list ... One of the most humbling things that has happened in my career is a recognition of all the things you did not know, and you go and say ""what could I have known or what should I have known?""' 'What these instances have illustrated or brought to the fore is that allowing interpretation at 88 countries as it was at the time is the wrong way to go and we should centralise control.' Mr Gulliver also told MPs the revelations had caused 'damage to trust and confidence' in the company and apologised for the Swiss private bank's ‘unacceptable practices’. The chief executive - who has worked for HSBC for 35 years  - told MPs: 'I would like to put on the record an apology from both myself and Douglas for the unacceptable events that took place at our private bank in Switzerland in the mid-2000s.' Chief executive Stuart Gulliver told MPs on the Treasury select committee that the revelations had caused 'damage to trust and confidence' in the company . He added: 'It is an apology we would like to make to you, our customers, our shareholders and the public at large. 'It clearly was unacceptable. We very much regret this, and it has damaged HSBC's reputation.' Asked precisely what he was apologising for, Mr Gulliver went on: 'The lack of controls and practices which now - judged with the benefit of hindsight - we would not be at all comfortable with if they were happening today, and which have clearly resulted in damage to trust and confidence in HSBC and created further reputational damage to our firm and have therefore hurt clients, customers, shareholders, our staff and people at large.' But he immediately came under fire for his own personal finances, following revelations he paid around £5million of bonuses into a Swiss bank account via a Panamanian holding company. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie questioned why Mr Gulliver ‘felt the need’ to put in place such ‘extraordinary arrangements’, which lasted between 1998 and 2009. HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said the bank faced a 'terrible list' of controversies, including PPI mis-selling and foreign exchange manipulation . Mr Gulliver admitted the scheme will look ‘strange’ to the general public. But there was ‘no tax advantage’ and it was set up purely to keep his bonuses secret from colleagues. The Derby-born 55-year-old added: ‘I myself grew up in Plymouth, I went to a state school so I can understand how the public perceives these issues.’ MPs also questioned why Mr Gulliver is domiciled for tax purposes in Hong Kong, despite being posted back to the UK by HSBC in 2003. He said he and his wife intend to move back to Hong Kong when he retires as chief executive and added that he had spent most of his 35-year career with HSBC in the former British colony. He said he has paid full UK tax on his earnings since 2003. Mr Tyrie told him: 'You've said you're trying to clean everything up. Some years ago, you were certainly muddying the waters with these extraordinary tax arrangements, weren't you?' HSBC is having to weather yet more controversy after the United States named it as one of the banks it's investigating over the possible manipulation of precious metals markets . The HSBC chief executive replied: 'I can understand how people find these arrangements kind of unusual. I myself grew up in Plymouth, I went to a state school, so I can understand why the public would find them unfamiliar and rather strange.' Mr Gulliver said he left the UK in 1980 with the intention of spending his career overseas, and had made his home in Hong Kong and set up the Panamanian 'nominee entity' in 1998 to channel his pay from the bank. 'There was no tax advantage or purpose whatsover to the Panamanian company. It was a Panamanian nominee entity constructed purely to give me privacy within my own company,' he said. 'At that point in 1998, my compensation was not a matter of public record. When I became a director of HSBC in 2008, my compensation became public and that structure was wound up in 2009. 'It was purely about privacy from colleagues in Hong Kong and Switzerland. We had a computer system back in the day that allowed everybody to inquire into staff accounts ... I was amongst the highest paid people and I wished to preserve my privacy from colleagues. Nothing more than that.' But Labour MP Mike Kane said: ‘You yourself with your own tax affairs look like you’re at the outer limits of aggressive tax avoidance. Do you think you have the moral authority to carry on this change process at HSBC?’ Mr Gulliver responded: ‘I believe the changes I have made to the firm clearly demonstrate the sincerity of my desire actually to change HSBC.’ Efforts to clean up the bank were stepped up after HSBC was fined £1.2billion in the US in 2012 for laundering money for Mexican drugs gangs. Asked by Tory MP David Ruffley whether he accepted the public expected ‘atonement’ for these latest transgressions in Switzerland, Mr Flint said ‘absolutely’. But he pinned the blame on executives who led the HSBC group private banking operation during the time in question. He said Chris Meares and Clive Bannister – son of four minute mile legend Sir Roger Bannister – ‘certainly bear a fairly direct responsibility for what went on in the private bank during their stewardship’. This week the bank disclosed profits slumped by 17 per cent last year.","HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said he was 'very ashamed' by events .

"It’s not as compact as the hoverboard Marty McFly promised us in 2015, but an ambitious New Zealand biochemist may have you walking on air sooner than expected with the first commercial jetpack set for release in 2016. Aviation fanatic Glenn Martin came from humble beginnings, labouring for over 30 years on the ground breaking invention in his back shed. On Tuesday the company responsible for the jet pack’s development, Martin Aircraft, was valued at more than $100 million after it successfully floated on the Australian Stock Market, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Scroll down for video . A very lucky test pilot sky-rocketing with the jetpack in a demonstration in Christchurch, NZ. Ringing in a new era: Glenn Martin (pictured right) with his wife and jet pack test pilot Vanessa (pictured left) at the Australian Securities Exchange . Taking in the view: The personal jetpack can soar to heights of up to a kilometre . Emergency services teams such as the police force, fire service, search & rescue, disaster recovery and border security are waiting to receive the highly sought-after technology - which will set customers back $255,000 a pop. With its slight frame and ability to navigate tightly confined spaces, the jet pack has the potential to go places other emergency services vehicles cannot, providing a practical alternative to traditional helicopters. Peter Coker, CEO of Martin Aircraft, says they're aiming to distribute the crafts to emergency responders and commercial customers by the third quarter of 2016, with an expectation of producing 500 per year, with a view to grow supply. The Martin jetpack is made possible by two large ducted fans driven by a V4 200 horsepower petrol engine which can propel the craft for up to 30 minutes at a speed of up to 74km/h and height of 1000 metres. Before and After: Getting a prototype (pictured left) off the ground and sleek new jetpack design (pictured right) Diagram outlining numerous features on the jetpack .

Max altitude: 1,000m . Engine:  200hp V4 2 stroke engine (Petrol) Safety features: low opening ballistic parachute, limited decent rate, GPS and safety capsule . Martin Aircraft shares attracted a 10 per cent increase from the initial stock price, with some attributing the success to a significant investment made by Chinese aerospace group Kuang-Chi Science, who have pledged up to $50 million over the next 2 and a half years to get the crafts in the air. The partnership with the Kuang-Chi Science company could prove to be more than financially beneficial as they are already a world leader in artificial materials and aeronautical technology. Martin Aircraft plan to launch an unmanned version that can carry up to 120kg over difficult terrain and water in a bid to appeal to military, mining or farming industries. Coker says they have their eyes set on creating a 'jetpack experience' for the tourism and entertainment market with hopes the personal jetpack could be on the market for the public by 2017.

"Holidaymakers were given a boost today as the pound soared to a seven-year high against the Euro. The pound is now worth just over €1.36 – the highest level since December 2007, just before the economic crash. Sterling was also up against the dollar – rising to under $1.55 – in the wake of yesterday's stock market surge which saw the FTSE hit a 15 year high. The pound is now worth just over €1.36 – the highest level since December 2007, just before the economic crash . The strengthening pound is a major boost for British families who had seen the cost of a holiday to France, Spain, Greece and other Eurozone countries soar. It comes amid growing signs that the economic recovery has finally taken hold – with unemployment down and growth set to be the strongest in nearly a decade. Inflation has also hit a record low and pay is finally taking off . The head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Angel Gurria yesterday urged the Government to push ahead with its economic reforms. He said: 'My main message to you is: well done so far ... but finish the job.' In a major boost for George Osborne, Mr Gurria lauded the Government's 'remarkable' stewardship of the economy. He even echoed a Tory slogan by hailing the Government's 'long term economic plan'. But the organisation also warned that UK plc's recovery would be in jeopardy unless productivity improved - and highlighted the continuing threat from high property prices. Launching the OECD's latest survey of the British economy, Mr Gurria noted that 2.6 per cent growth last year was the highest in the G7. The organisation expects the rate to be the same this year. David Cameron has been buoyed by a string of positive economic news, including a 'pat on the back' from the OECD yesterday . The FTSE 100 Index has risen to a record high, its previous life-time high set on December 30, 1999 . Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said interest could be cut below 0.5 per cent - but it was still more likely that they would rise . Interest rates could be cut even further from their already record low of just 0.5 per cent, the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney revealed yesterday. The Bank chief said the banking system could cope with interest rates being cut closer to zero – but refused to say how far they could fall. However, Mr Carney insisted it was still more likely that rates would go up after inflation returns to normal after a period of falling prices this year. Mr Carney said that three-quarters of the current weakness in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and food, which he said was a 'temporary, one-off development'. He stressed that if there was any evidence of a sustained fall in inflation, the Bank could 'if necessary' cut interest rates from their current 0.5 per cent low to zero, but he emphasised that the 'focus of policy is towards tightening'. He said: 'Because of the resilience of banking and building societies has increased, we are in a position where we could, if necessary, cut bank rates towards zero. That is – to a level that is still above zero – but we haven't specified a specific level.' Mr Gurria said the performance of the labour market had been 'remarkable', with three million jobs created over the past five years. Relative to the size of the UK population, the figures were even better than those recorded in the US over the period, he said. 'Even as unemployment has fallen, inflationary pressures have vanished ... real wages are on the rise,' Mr Gurria told a press conference in the Treasury. 'We are predicting this economic expansion will continue this year and next. What a difference effective economic policies can make.' The fall in the oil price combined with fears over Greece had pulled markets lower at the start of 2015 but tentative hopes of a new deal on Athens' debts have, together with a slight bounce-back for oil, helped them recover. It comes after the FTSE 100 ended 2014 lower than it started in the first annual fall since 2011, leaving investors hoping for a better performance this year. Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, said that UK shares had underperformed relative to Wall Street in the last couple of years, leaving them relatively cheap. Equities had been held back by falling commodity prices and anxiety over the Scottish referendum, meaning the market now offers better valuations for those hunting dividends, he said. Added to the likelihood of interest rates remaining low until the end of the year, it produced a 'positive combination' for investors. Mr Osborne seized on the praise from the OECD, including the Tories' election slogan about having a 'long term economic plan'. The Chancellor wrote on Twitter: 'The OECD report shows we have right strategy & Sec Gen Gurria says 'Britain has a long term economic plan & we need to stick to it' - I agree.' Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'This report confirms that the UK economy is returning to health and highlights the vital role of key Liberal Democrat policies in the turnaround. 'Our dramatic increases in the personal allowance, the greening of the economy, the focus on infrastructure, and putting the financial sector back on an even keel are just a few examples of where Liberal Democrat thinking has been central to the economic turnaround. 'Our commitment to continue the same balanced approach in the next parliament is in stark contrast to the Conservatives, who are abandoning fairness and the centre ground. 'By urging years of cuts for cuts' sake, by unfairly finishing the job of balancing the books on the backs of the least well-off and undermining our position in Europe, they will put this hard-won recovery at risk.' Shadow chief secretary to the treasury Chris Leslie said: 'The OECD is right to highlight the challenge of increasing productivity in order to sustainably raise living standards and so get the deficit down. 'This is what Labour's better plan for Britain's prosperity, which we published this month, is all about. Our plan includes cutting business rates for small firms, reforming the banking sector, investing in training and apprenticeships and keeping Britain in a reformed EU. 'Government standing back and hoping wealth will trickle-down from the top to everyone else simply won't work. We need a recovery that reaches kitchen tables across Britain, not one which has left working people £1,600 a year worse off since 2010.'","The pound is now worth just over €1.36 – highest level since end of 2007 .

"Hillary Clinton, a probable Democratic presidential candidate, is lending her support to a proposal that would give federal regulators more power over the Internet on the eve of a vote to enact the measure. Commonly referred to as net neutrality, the measure would also ban Internet 'fast lanes' for some content producers while slowing down data arrival time for others. Federal regulators plan to approve the set of rules on Thursday, setting up a years-long battle. The 'net neutrality' rules, which seek to guarantee equal access to all online services, are likely to spark fresh challenges in court and efforts in Congress to nullify or revamp the plan. The latest attempt by the Federal Communications Commission to bring the Internet under its control followed public pressure on the independent agency from President Barack Obama. Clinton, a probable Democratic presidential candidate, is lending her support to a proposal that would give federal regulators more power over the internet on the eve of a vote to enact the measure . Critics of the plan, which FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, has refused to release to the public before the vote, and of the Obama administration, have argued that president overstepped his authority in trying to influence the regulatory agency's activity. The FCC, they said, is poised to inappropriately spread its authority to a communications system Congress hasn't given it permission to meddle with. Republicans in Congress has vowed to investigate the power play, and a GOP member of the commission, Ajit Pai, has warned that the 'secret' plan will give 'a Washington bureaucracy a blank check to decide how Internet service providers deploy and manage their networks from the last mile all the way through to the Internet backbone.' Clinton on Tuesday said she believed that her former boss, President Obama, was 'right' to get involved. 'For the FCC to do what they want to do, to try to create net neutrality as the norm, they have to have a hook to hang it on,' Clinton said. 'It’s a foot in the door, it’s a value statement, I think the president is right to be upfront and out front on that.' A former New York senator, Clinton said she would vote for net neutrality if she were in a position to 'because as I understand it, it’s Title II with a lot of changes within it, in order to avoid the worst of the utility regulation.' Wheeler earlier this month unveiled the plan to regulate broadband Internet service providers as 'public utility' carriers, revamping the agency's rules struck down by a federal court last year. The rulemaking effort elicited an unprecedented four million comments, with passionate arguments on both sides about the importance of 'freedom' and the need to encourage 'innovation' and investment. The FCC's five member board will vote on the proposal on Thursday. It is comprised of three Democrats and two Republicans, with the head usually coming the president's party, giving his side more weight even though the agency itself is technically independent. The Republican commissioners are expected to vote against the net neutrality measures. A Democratic commissioner, set to support the plan, had a change of heart this week and is now lobbying Wheeler to weaken the proposal and eliminate a provision that would give the commission authority over 'broadband subscriber access services.' A fact sheet published by the FCC says the mandate would give it the ability to interfere with policies put worth by Internet providers if the agency believes they are 'not just and reasonable.' That includes the existence of so-called Internet tolls that slow down the rate at which consumers are able to stream videos on sites like Netflix, which last year accused Comcast of purposefully slowing down the pace at which their subscribers could view content. If adopted, the 'open Internet' rules would bar 'paid prioritization', blocking of legal content or 'throttling.' Commonly referred to as net neutrality, the measure would ban internet 'fast lanes' for some content producers while slowing down data arrival time for others. Federal regulators plan to vote on the rule change on Thursday . The House or Representatives' Energy and Commerce and Oversight and Government Reform Committees had plans this week to hold hearings on the FCC's plans but abruptly cancelled them on Wednesday after they say Wheeler refused to testify. 'We are deeply disappointed in Chairman Wheeler’s decision,' the committee's chairs, Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, and Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, said in a statement. 'As Chairman Wheeler pushes forward with plans to regulate the Internet, he still refuses to directly answer growing concerns about how the rules were developed, how they are structured, and how they will stand up to judicial scrutiny. The Republicans chided Wheeler for insisting on 'secrecy' rather than transparency in evaluating the rule change and reminded him that he'll eventually have to appear before the lawmaking body. 'Chairman Wheeler and the FCC are not above Congress. This fight continues as the future of the Internet is at stake,' they wrote. Meanwhile, net neutrality's backers continued to cheer Wheeler and his allies on the FCC on. 'This is a big step forward for consumers,' said Chris Lewis at the consumer activist lobby Public Knowledge, which has been pressing for strong net neutrality rules. Lewis said the rules would ensure 'an Internet where consumers can go anywhere they want,' without seeing services or applications blocked for competitive or financial reasons. Senator Patrick Leahy also welcomed the effort, saying it will 'ban pay-to-play deals that could strangle innovation from startups and small businesses, creating an Internet divided between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots.'' FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, has refused to release to the public before the vote. He's also evading Congress, accoording to two House committee heads. They warned him today that he is not above the legislative branch and will have to report to the lawmaking body at some point . The 'open Internet' rules, which would become final if adopted by the five-member FCC, would bar 'paid prioritization,' blocking of legal content or 'throttling' -- slowing a rival service which competes with one backed by the Internet provider. But critics say the Wheeler plan is heavy-handed, based on a 1934 law aimed at regulating phone companies, and claim it will stifle investment and cost consumers more, because broadband firms would not be able to generate revenue through special deals. Michael Powell, head of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, which represents broadband cable operators, said the FCC was moving toward 'onerous regulation and could well depress investment and innovation.' Powell said the move opens the door to rate regulation despite Wheeler's claim to steer clear of this. Former FCC commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth said the agency faces a difficult legal path trying to classify broadband as a public utility without imposing other regulations imposed on telecom firms. 'I don't think the commission has thought this through,' said Furchtgott-Roth, who heads the Hudson Institute's Center for Economics of the Internet. By selectively imposing regulations, he said, the FCC opens itself up to legal challenges. And while FCC officials have not released details of the plan, Furchtgott-Roth said the reclassification will likely mean 'billions of dollars in new fees and taxes' which would be imposed either at the federal or state level. GOP commissioner Ajit Pai tweeted this photo of himself holding the massive set of rules Democrats on the board of the FCC want to slap on internet service providers. Pai, who has seen and read the proposal, said 'the president's plan will lead to less competition and leave Americans with fewer broadband choices' The FCC move also sparked criticism in the Republican-led Congress, which has the authority to nullify the rules or pass legislation to reverse some of the mandates. Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte, head of the House Judiciary Committee, said Wheeler 'overestimates the FCC's authority to rewrite our nation's communications laws... and ignores the fact that his net neutrality rules almost certainly will be stuck in courts for years over questions of their legality.' The FCC action comes three months after President Barack Obama endorsed a strong net neutrality effort, saying no online service should be forced into a 'slow lane.' As a result, some Republicans are denouncing the FCC move as 'the Obama plan' and questioning whether the president unduly sought to influence the independent rulemaking agency. FCC commission member Ajit Pai said in a statement that 'the president's plan will lead to less competition and leave Americans with fewer broadband choices,' describing the effort as an 'approach imposed in Europe' which has led to less private investment. Some 16,000 websites are endorsing the neutrality effort, in a coalition that includes Tumblr, Mozilla, MediaFire and online review site Yelp. In a blog post, Yelp said that without FCC enforcement of open access, 'the Internet could fall victim to entrenched, monopolistic ISPs and gatekeeper companies who would control when, how, from whom and at what cost you view content online. This threatens the very core of American freedom and values.' Twitter public policy manager Will Carty said the FCC rules would guarantee 'the ability for all users to 'innovate without permission'' and 'have important implications for freedom of expression.'","The proposal would give federal regulators more power over the Internet .

"Malcolm Turnbull has refused to echo Prime Minister Tony Abbott's dramatic attacks on Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs,  heaping praise on her instead. Mr Abbott publicly flayed Prof Triggs after the commission released a report examining the conditions of children held in detention. 'It's a political stitch-up,' said Mr Abbott of the report. He told Parliament on Tuesday that his government had lost confidence in Prof Triggs. But the Communications Minister struck a different tone on Wednesday, highlighting Prof Triggs' reputation in the legal community and emphasising the focus should be on children in detention. Scroll down for video . Striking a different tone: Mr Turnbull today declined to criticise Gillian Triggs, the president of the Human Rights Commission, who he said he had known since she was the Dean of Law at Sydney University . Conflict: Human Rights Commission President Gillian Triggs (pictured left) has been publicly criticised by Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right), who today appeared at a home in Sydney . 'I'm not going to buy into this discussion about Gillian Triggs. I mean I've known Gillian Triggs for many years,' Mr Turnbull told reporters. 'She's a very distinguished legal academic. I knew her when she was the Dean of Law at Sydney University. 'But I don't, I don't want to get into... this has become a very controversial issue and there's lots of allegations flying about.' He then echoed remarks he made on ABC television earlier in February, saying the government must focus on getting kids out of detention. 'She's a very distinguished legal academic,' Mr Turnbull (above) told reporters of Gillian Triggs . Mr Turnbull, pictured, appeared at a Telstra phone exchange in Queanbeyan, outside of Canberra. Mr Turnbull is a member of Mr Abbott's cabinet and serves as Communications Minister . 'The critical thing is the children, we should be focussed on the children and getting them out of detention. 'And the fact is, the irrefutable fact is that our government has got hundreds and hundreds of children out of detention and there are more coming out all the time.' Mr Turnbull said the government had reduced the number of children in detention from the 1400 under Labor in September 2013. The millionaire was widely touted as a potential candidate if a leadership spill motion went ahead earlier this month. Mr Turnbull did not stand for the position and Mr Abbott won the vote without a candidate standing against him, 61 to 39. Look, I’m not going to engage in a discussion about personalities, I’d just make this observation about the children in detention issue. When the Labor Party won office in 2007 there were no children in detention because of the Howard Government’s successful management of our borders. There were no boats, there was no people smuggling, and so there were no kids in detention. As you know, Kevin Rudd changed the policy, there was a massive increase in people smuggling, a massive increase in unauthorised arrivals, and we had a peak of 2000 kids in detention and at the time that we came into government, when Labor was voted out in 2013, there were about 1,400 children in detention. That number, in terms of children onshore is 126 and as you know from what Mike Pazullo said in estimates this week that is rapidly coming down. So the bottom line is this: any child in detention, one child in detention is one child too many. You know, this is not -- everyone is anguished by having children locked up in detention. We don’t want to have any children in detention. The best way for children not to be in detention of course is for them not to get on to people smugglers’ boats. And of course we’ve effectively ensured that by stopping the boats, by Scott Morrison stopping the boats. Going forward, our goal is to get those kids out of detention, and of course if they’re not coming in the front door it’s much easier to reduce the numbers and that is what is happening. Peter Dutton, as you know, is very focussed on that and I think we have a very good story. I just want to recap: the issue is not Gillian Triggs, or personalities, or arguments about the Human Rights Commission. The issue is the children. You know, all of us, as parents in particular, know how anguished it must be for children to be in these circumstances. Of course they were put there by their parents choosing to come to Australia on people smugglers’ boats, we are getting them out of detention and that is, that is one of the signal achievements of the government. Look, I’m not going to buy into this discussion about Gillian Triggs; I mean I’ve known Gillian Triggs for many years. She’s a very distinguished international legal academic. I knew her when she was the Dean of Law at Sydney University, but I don’t, I don’t want to get into, obviously this has become a very controversial issue and there are all sorts of allegations flying around. I don’t want to get involved in that or comment on that today, other people can do that if they wish. The critical thing is the children, we should be focussed on the children and getting them out of detention. And the fact is, the irrefutable fact is that our government has got hundreds and hundreds of children out of detention and there are more coming out all the time.

"A restaurant's vigilante bid to find a couple who skipped out on their bill after an expensive meal and left a wallet emblazoned with a line out of the movie Pulp Fiction has gone viral after the establishment's owners posted a search warrant for the pair online. A French couple allegedly ordered and ate an extravagant three-course meal, told the waiters they were going for a cigarette and left a wallet on the table for assurance while they stepped outside. But the diners never returned and when the waitress picked up the wallet she found the words ‘bad mother***er’ ironically embossed on its underside. The owners of Mojos restaurant in Bunbury, Western Australia, Juliana Frisina and Noel Brunning, took to their Facebook page on Sunday in a bid to track down the couple who walked out without paying on Saturday night. Scroll down for video . Wanted: Mojos restaurant in WA is looking for this couple after the allegedly walked out without paying . Mojos status warned the couple that they have 'very identifiable tattoos and nose rings' ‘WANTED YOUNG FRENCH COUPLE. Could the young French couple who skipped paying their bill last night come back today & rectify the situation,’ the Facebook post read. ‘You have very identifiable tattoos & nose rings & work in a nearby farm. Man was heavily tattooed & the female had septum piecing in her nose. ‘We will get the footage off the security cameras & take to the Police tomorrow if you haven't settled your account by tonight ,’ they warned. The owners of Mojos restaurant in Bunbury, Western Australia, Juliana Frisina and Noel Brunning (pictured) posted on their restaurant's Facebook page after the incident . After they received an 'overwhelming' response from the local community they thanked everyone for their help . The post was shared thousands of times and has now been seen by almost 30,000 people but the couple did not return to the restaurant so the owners also posted a grainy CCTV image of the pair on Facebook. A man is seen wearing a purple t-shirt and blue shirt, while a blonde woman is dressed in a black strappy top. ‘Wanted. This French Couple who skipped their substantial bill on Saturday 21st Feb at Mojo's. Anyone seen them, call Mojo's or CrimeStoppers. 1800333000,’ the update read. Co-owner Ms Frisina told Daily Mail Australia: ‘They had a lovely time with their food and drink. 'It was a substantial amount for a couple.’ The French couple reportedly ordered a 'substantial' three-course meal from Mojos . 'It's the one that says bad motherf*****': The wallet the couple left on the table was reminiscent of the one Samuel L. Jackson owns in Pulp Fiction . The diners came for a three-course-meal at Mojos where the owners say 'most people are pretty honest' She said she never expected the post to go viral, usually the restaurant’s Facebook updates only receive a few hundred ‘likes’. ‘We didn’t expect it to go out like it did, it quickly surpassed 10,000 views and is now up past 30,000. ‘We were just astounded at the community support, the way people jumped to support,’ Ms Frisina said. ‘This couple were intent on leaving. They left a couple of times for smokes out the front and then made a big show about leaving the wallet on the table, which turned out to be empty. ‘We don’t know who they are we only know they are French because they were conversing with our French waitress, they told her they were working in a farm,’ Ms Frisina explained. Mr Brunning and Ms Frisina have reported the incident to local police. ‘Most people are pretty good and usually it’s a genuine mistake when someone runs away from a cup of coffee… most people are pretty honest,’ Ms Frisina said.","Samuel L.

"People across a wide swath of the West, from Arizona to Canada, looked up at the sky late Monday to see a cluster of weird lights followed by an orange tail streaking across the night. The lights were not a meteor or UFO, but a Chinese rocket booster that broke apart, said Maj. Martin O'Donnell, a spokesman for U.S. Strategic Command. There were no reports of damage or injuries, O'Donnell said, pointing to statistics showing there is a one in a trillion chance of being hit by space debris. Scroll down for video . Starry sky: This Monday, Febuary 23, 2015, ten second time exposure photo provided by Neil Zeller, shows a streak of light from what is believed to be a Chinese rocket burning up upon re-entry, in the atmosphere as seen from Calgary, Canada . Canadian photographer Neil Zeller was on his way home from shooting the Northern Lights when he saw the cluster of fireballs in a rural area outside of Calgary about 11pm MST. 'I'd never seen anything like it,' he said. He captured several shots of an orange streak slashed above dark trees. More than 150 people reported seeing the group of about three dozen fireballs, said Mike Hankey with the American Meteor Society. It lingered in the sky for more than a minute, showing slow movement that is a sure sign of a man-made object re-entering from space, he said. Naturally occurring meteors last just a few seconds. 'It was pretty significant - over 150 reports is a lot. It covered a real wide range,' Hankey said. The reports came from nine Western states as well as Alberta and British Columbia in Canada. Caught on camera: People from Arizona to Canada have reported seeing bright lights in the sky as the Chinese rocket burned up in the atmosphere . Eeerie imagery: Witnesses described the lights as a group of about three dozen fireballs moving slowly from south to north late Monday . Zeller, a freelance photographer, said he first thought it might be a plane crashing, and then was reminded of the 1986 Challenger explosion. He was relieved when he discovered it was a rocket booster. The rocket that launched a satellite on December 27, wasn't abnormally large, said O'Donnell. Angle of re-entry and weather conditions can make space objects look brighter from earth. Matthew Hepworth, a video producer, said he was driving south of Salt Lake City when he saw very bright orange lights that looked like a searchlight at first. He captured the bright streak on his dash-cam, an investment he made because of the meteor footage caught by such cameras in Russia in 2013. Utah-based NASA ambassador Patrick Wiggins said most such events go unnoticed. 'There are literally thousands of satellites orbiting the earth and these things fall out of the sky all of the time,' he said. 'This one just happened to be passing over some fairly large metropolitan areas and it did it at night.'

"As London Fashion Week draws to a close many style-watchers will be compiling a list of trends they want to try. Although many of the outfits may be a little too outlandish for most of us, one way to attempt a catwalk look is by adopting the hair or beauty trends. Aside from being more affordable than rebooting your entire wardrobe, it is also an easy way to wear catwalk styles without waiting for the collections to filter into high street stores. Hairdresser to the stars Andrew Jose shows you how to recreate the hair scene on the LFW catwalk . Hairdresser Andrew Jose, who counts Louise Redknapp, Jodie Kidd, Burberry model Jamie Campbell Bower and Alanis Morisette among his clients, says that this season has seen a plethora of both classic hair looks as well as new trends worth trying. 'At the beginning of every new season, fashion month tells an intricate story of new ideas, concepts and looks intertwined with a glimpse of some firm favourites. 'LFW 2015 has not failed to disappoint, showcasing the very best of the design elite, we have seen some beautiful shows from where this seasons new and eclectic trends will emerge from' Here he shares some of his top looks from the capital's most fashionable week and tells you how you can achieve them. WAVES AND WOODSTOCK . Texture and movement played a big part this season. Both Topshop and Matthew Williamson used texture to create very different looks for the shows. Topshop created a Highland-inspired look – a matte, windswept style. A messy side parting was teamed with a  scrunched in, blown out look. Simple to recreate, all this look needs is slightly damp hair, a handful of Salon Science Cellumax Foam, £17.00, a light weight, long lasting foam that instantly lifts and adds volume even to fine and fragile hair. Topshop created a highland inspired style (left) and Matthew Williamson saw Woodstock style tresses (right) Scrunch in to hair with an upwards movement – flip head upside down and blast with a hair dryer to set the natural movement in the hair. For those with fine, straight hair, use a curling tong in big sections to create a bend in the hair, then once the section of hair has been released, pull the ends of the section outwards to straighten out a curl that is too pronounced. Shake out hair with fingers and mist over hair with Lee Stafford 'My Big Fat Texturised hair Super Spray (£9.49 Boots) for a gritty matte finish. To recreate the Mathew Williamson Woodstock half ponytail, a bohemian look  perfect for everyday hair, simply set hair in to a centre parting and gently backcomb at the crown . Gather the top section into a loose half ponytail and simply pin in place by crossing over two Kirby grips or a snag-free band. This will create a face framing halo of hair that looks practically angelic. A quick mist of firm hold hair spray is all it will take to keep this style in place all day. LOW SLUNG STYLING . Relaxed, low slung hair was seen on the catwalk at House of Holland . Relaxed, low slung hair was the order of the week this season, Markus Lupfer and House of Holland embraced the nape of the neck by creating styles that were as low as you can go. The low slung ponytails had flattering volume at the crown that framed the face from the front, giving a cheeky rear detail. Recreate the undone pony from Markus Lupfer, by creating smooth, glossy and healthy hair with a touch of movement. Part hair in the centre, apply Salon Science Reglosse Smoothing Serum, £18, to the palms of your hands, rub hands together and smooth through the ends of the hair to take away any frizz. The Reglosse Serum contains grape seed extract to help tame and instantly nourish dry, frizzy, uncontrollable hair and smooth unruly flyaways. Gather hair in to a loose pony at the nape of the neck Using a snag-free band, tie your ponytail but making sure the band is halfway down the hair shaft. When you get to the final tie, don't pull the hair all the way through but create a loop with the ends of the hair. Pull a few loose messy face framing strands at the front Create a different take on this trend by simply wrapping a scarf around your neck and over your hair - secure at the front, then pull hair out a little so it creates a faux bob. TOP TIP: Always use a treatment once a week for the healthiest hair possible but remember to use it after shampoo but before conditioner. Shampoo works to rough up the cuticles, removing any dirt from the hair shaft, this then makes the perfect absorbing environment for the masque to penetrate the cuticle to repair and nourish from within. The conditioner then works to shut the cuticle back down again, locking in the goodness leaving the cuticle flat and shining with health. The Swiss Apple Salon Science Cellutensive Masque (£19, Boots) is a rejuvenating and anti-ageing cellular treatment containing powerful plant stem cells to protect and improve the hair's health, strength and thickness - and a great quick fix for hair that needs a little bit of love. CURRENT BUNS AND PONY HYBRIDS . Jonathan Saunders brought back the messy bun coupled with a Sixties vibe. The hair was pulled back as tight as can be, and glossed over with a wet-look gel. To get this look keep the pulled back hair as flat as possible then fix in to a mid pony between the crown and the nape of the neck. Buns and ponytails got a reinvention at Johnathan Saunders (left) and Apu Jan (right) Backcomb the pony to create volume and smooth over the top with a soft bristled brush to polish out the backcomb on the surface. Wrap the hair around the base of the pony, pinning as you go. Instead of pinning in the end section, leave it to hang below to create a hybrid bun and pony. Apu Jan also showcased a similar bun, positioned lower down with a bit more texture. To recreate use a texturizing dust on the ponytail and rubbing it into the hair using the palms of the hands, this will create a matt effect with lots more volume before wrapping in to a bun. TOP TIP: When styling a heavy pronounced centre parting, do bear in mind that a lot of scalp will be on show! Make sure you treat your scalp as you would the skin on your face by lavishing it with lots of tlc. Take your haircare cue from skincare by remembering to exfoliate and moisturise. Try the Salon Science Hydrafoliant scalp scrub £15.00, a pre-shampoo scalp treatment containing powerful exfoliants to lift and remove old skin cells for a visibly smoother and clearer scalp. Then moisturise with a slick of Salon Science Hyrdrasorb intentsive masque £17.00. An intensive, scalp purifying treatment with ultra-hydrating compounds to restore optimum moisture levels, leaving hair instantly radiating health. SEVENTIES CRIMP AND GLOSSED-BACK SIDES . This season Preen paid homage to the Seventies with big roller disco inspired hair. Heavily gelled flat centre parting mixed with big fluffed out frizzy waves can be made more wearable by diffusing the look into teased out curls at the sides. For thick hair, always curl hair the day after washing so it has a little less slip. Mist a heat-protecting spray all over hair such as Salon Science Swiss Grape GSP-T Reprotectant Thermal Crème (£16) which contains a powerful antioxidant complex that binds to the hair's surface for advanced protection. Preen paid homage to the 70s crimp (left) and Julian Macdonald incorporated a wetlook style . This protective, conditioning spray prevents damage caused by heated appliances whilst using vitamin E antioxidants and state-of-the-art UV filter systems for protection against daily environmental stress. Then start to tong two-inch sections with a large-barrel curling iron to create lazy waves. Roll each curl up on your finger and pin to the root - continue all over and mist over with hairspray Let the curls cool and remove the pins - then brush through lightly with your fingers. TOP TIP: Sleep with hair in one or two plaits depending on how thick your hair is. The next morning you will wake up with instant textured waves - the perfect foundation for tonging and back-combing into mussed up waves . The Julian Macdonald show incorporated a wet-look at the sides by slicking back the sides of each girl's hair with handfuls of hair gel. Recreate a softer version of this look to cheat out the second or third day hair with no time for a hair wash. Disguise oily roots with this quick get out of bed fix, simply slick through some gel through the top and side sections sections of hair. Then roughly pin up the sides criss-crossing the Kirby grips to anchor the hair - this will create a faux hawk shape half up style!","Trying catwalk hair is an easy way to wear AW15  trends without the wait .

"The family of Chad Littlefield, who was shot dead alongside famed U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, has spoken out about their relief that the killer was found guilty of murder on Tuesday. Eddie Ray Routh, 27, was emotionless as the jury in Stephenville, Texas read their verdict last night: that he had not been insane when he opened fire on the two men in February 2013. They had taken him to a shooting range to help him settle back into society after he left the Marines. After the verdict, Littlefield's brother, Jerry Richardson, turned to Routh and said: 'You took the lives of two heroes, men that tried to be a friend to you. You became an American disgrace.' As the family also spoke out on the Today show on Wednesday morning, jurors stepped forward to say they had 'no doubt' that Routh knew what he was doing at the time of the murders.

Relief: The parents of victim Chad Littlefield, Judy and Don Littlefield, pictured right, and his brother Jerry Richardson, left, said the guilty verdict for his killer 'was an answered prayer' The verdict came as interest in Kyle's career as the U.S. military's deadliest-ever sniper reached fever pitch thanks to Oscar-nominated film about his life, 'American Sniper'. Ahead of the trial, Routh's lawyers had argued that the popularity of the movie, which grossed $300 million at the box office, would mean he could not get a fair trial. And speaking on Good Morning America on Wednesday, the jurors admitted some of them had seen the movie - but insisted they had put that out of their minds when making their decision. 'It gave me a better outlook on Chris' role as a Marine,' one of the jurors, Barrett Hutchinson, said. 'But as far as the actions that took place on February 2, Chad was still in the picture and Chad was not in that movie. 'I took the fact that Chris was a marine out of my mind and looked at him as a person, looked at Chad as a person, looked at Eddie as a person and, you know, tried to make reasonable judgment.' Also on Wednesday, Chad Littlefield's family spoke out about the verdict. 'It was an answered prayer,' Judy Littlefield told the Today show. 'We've waited a long time to hear that. We feel justice has been served.' Guilty: Eddie Ray Routh, 27, was convicted of capital murder by a jury in Texas after just two hours of deliberations on Tuesday evening and has been sentenced to life in prison without parole . Beloved: Chad Littlefield, pictured above left and right, was not a veteran but was committed to helping them when they returned from overseas, his parents said. He was shot dead by Routh in February 2013 . Victim: Famed U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, pictured with his wife Taya, was also shot dead by Routh. The two men had taken Routh to a shooting range to help him with his PTSD when they were killed . Routh's brother-in-law added that he never once believed Routh had been insane. Routh's attorneys had tried to prove he was in a psychotic state at the time of the killings. 'It was all an act,' Jerry Richardson said. 'I taught him in high school and... that's just the way he was. He never grew up. He was still just opposite defiant, and he had nothing wrong in the mind except for the drug use.' Chad's father Don remembered his son as a 'quiet man' and 'a good listener' who met Kyle at their children's soccer practices. The two men shared an interest in working out and helping veterans, Don said. Chad himself was not a veteran but wanted to help others. 'Chris served overseas and Chad served when they came back,' Mrs Littlefield explained. Mr Littlefield added: 'His motto was pass it forward.' Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, testified in the trial but has not spoken out since the verdict. She was seen in the courtroom on Tuesday but did not return when the decision was read. Fair trial? Jury members also spoke out on Wednesday and said they had 'no doubt' Routh was guilty - but they also admitted that some of them had seen the 'American Sniper' movie ahead of the trial . Chris Kyle's brother and parents were seen hugging and crying inside the courtroom after the verdict, but they did not issue a statement. As prosecutors decided not to pursue the death penalty, the only possible sentence for Routh was life in prison - with no chance of parole. Kyle and Littlefield had taken Routh to the shooting range at Rough Creek Lodge and Resort on February 2, 2013, after Routh's mother asked Kyle to help her troubled son. Family members say Routh suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder from serving in Iraq and in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. Defense attorneys noted that Kyle had described Routh as 'straight-up nuts' in a text message to Littlefield as they drove to the luxury resort and asked Littlefield to watch his back. While at the shooting range, Routh first opened fire on Littlefield, then turned on Kyle, whom he shot six times. He later said he was 'riled up' because Littlefield wasn't joining in with the shooting, then murdered Kyle too because he knew he would kill him. Psychiatrists for the defense also claimed Routh believed the men were human-pig hybrids who were going to assassinate him. Heartbroken: The strain showed on the face of Taya, Kyle's widow, pictured in court yesterday, ahead of the jury's guilty verdict. She was not in the courtroom when the jury read their decision . Families: Deby Kyle, Chris Kyle's mother (right) is seen leaving the courtroom after the verdict, alongside Judy and Don Littlefield (left), whose son Chris was killed at the same time . After shooting the men dead, he fled in Kyle's pickup truck, drove to see family members and even stopped at Taco Bell. He was eventually arrested after a police chase and later confessed to the crime on video, which was played to the jury. Among evidence entered by prosecutors was a recorded phone call between Routh and a reporter  in which Routh said he was annoyed Littlefield wasn't shooting. 'Are you gonna shoot? Are you gonna shoot? It's a shooting sport. You shoot,' Routh said in the phone call. 'That's what got me all riled up.' Routh's friends and family testified that his behavior in the weeks before the shootings was increasingly erratic and that 'he did not seem all there' after gunning down the two men. Routh, who served with the Marines in Iraq and Haiti, had been admitted to Veterans Affairs hospitals on multiple occasions after his service to treat mental illness. They said he was unable to care for himself, acted as if he believed that someone was going to hurt him and thought that the government was listening to him. Caught: Routh is pictured in the back of a police car after he fled the scene of the murder in Kyle's truck before he was eventually caught. He claimed he shot the two men because he feared they would kill him . This pistol, found in Kyle's truck, which Routh fled in, matched bullet fragments found in Littlefield's body . Confession: Routh, pictured hours after the killings, confessed to the shootings almost immediately . 'It was clear that he was psychotic,' Mitchell H. Dunn, a forensic psychiatrist for the defense, told the court on Thursday. 'There was no question about that.' But the jury rejected the claim after prosecutors contended Routh knew what he was doing and acted deliberately when he shot the two and then fled. They said any bizarre behavior was the result of Routh's reliance on marijuana. He had smoked the drug with his uncle the morning before the shootings. A prosecution expert, Dr. Michael Arambula, said Routh's actions do not meet the legal definition of insanity under state criminal law. 'Any time intoxication is present, the game is over,' Arambula testified. See below for video . Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . Chad Littlefield, then 35, was killed in 2013 along with his more famous friend Chris Kyle . The case of Eddie Ray Routh has been dubbed the 'American Sniper' trial after its most famous victim, author and US Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. However the other casualty of that February day at a Texas shooting range was Chad Littlefield, Kyle's devout  friend who also helped out with the sniper's charitable foundation. He was trying to help smooth Routh's transition to civilian life when he was shot , age 35. Born in Dallas in 1977, he graduated from DeSoto High School in 1995. The father was devoted to his wife LeAnn, daughter Morgan, now nine, and Christianity. Though he did not serve in the military, he was passionate about helping veterans with Kyle, who he met through their daughters soccer team. He had visited his parents the day before his death, and spent extra time at their house that day. 'Mom, life is so good it's scary,' he told mother Judy that day, according to the Stephenville Empire-Tribune. He was working for an oil-services firm in DeSoto as a logistics manager and was known as the peacekeeper in his family, always urging relatives to talk through their conflicts. The charity volunteer hugged his parents right before he said goodbye to them for the last time. His parents gave a statement to reporters after Routh was convicted of their son's murder. We've waited two years for god to get justice for us on behalf of our son, Chad's mother Judy said. 'We're so thrilled that we have the verdict we have tonight.' Littlefield's father Don, a high school football coach, confronted Routh, who said he did not remember Chad's name, after the trial, the Star-Telegram reported. He said 'You will have the rest of your wasted life, each and every day, to remember his name. Let me remind you. His name was Chad Littlefield.' Littlefield would have turned 38  on February 11.","Eddie Ray Routh, 27, will spend life in prison after he was found guilty on Tuesday of gunning down Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield in February 2013 .

"At only 12 years of age, Nicole Graney was facing a battle she had never anticipated fighting, and one that she didn't fully understand. The very new teenager who had only just entered high school in Sydney had been diagnosed with a very adult disease- ovarian cancer. 'I had a doctor's appointment in the middle of the day, and had to leave school. I remember telling my friends that I would only be gone for an hour,' Nicole, now 16, told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Nicole Graney (right) was diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was just 12 years old . However, she didn't anticipate the ultrasound revealing that the hard lump in her stomach needed urgent surgery to remove it. 'My mum was in the room with me and was in shock. When we got out to the waiting room she started crying and calling people, but I just stood there thinking to myself ""what's happening?"",' Nicole said. 'I remember being wheeled into surgery and seeing mum and saying goodbye to her because I might not see her again. That was one of the scariest moments of my life,' she said. 'I was pretty naive, I thought that it was a cyst and that the doctors would be able to drain it out with a needle and I'd have a pinprick scar,' she said. Instead, Nicole left with a 15 centimetre scar and the new knowledge that the lump that had been removed was actually ovarian cancer. 'When I found out I fell into shock, I didn't know what to think or do,' Nicole said. Before undergoing chemotherapy to fight the ovarian cancer, Nicole had long red hair . During the treatment, Nicole lost her hair and gained 27 kilograms which made her very self-conscious . Nicole during her chemotherapy treatment without a wig (left) and with a wig that she never took off (right) 'I'd seen people in my family going through the same thing. My cousin was nine when he died of a brain tumour, and it was shocking seeing him go through the transformation when he had been such a healthy boy,' she said. 'All I could think was, ""Is that going to happen to me?"".' Nicole, who said she was overwhelmed by the diagnosis, decided not to tell any of her school friends and kept her cancer a secret out of fear that they would treat her differently. The high school student went through one cycle of chemotherapy each month, consisting of a week of chemotherapy, a week of recovery and two weeks at school, before the exhausting process would begin again. 'The nausea was the worst. I was put on really harsh drugs and got awful headaches and it turned me off food, but then after the chemo I couldn't stop eating,' Nicole said. 'I had a lot of support at the start and by this point my friends had figured out what was going on and my school actually held a fundraiser for me,' she said. Nicole said that having a supportive family including her sister (right) made a big difference in her fight . The high school student went through one cycle of chemotherapy each month, consisting of a week of chemotherapy, a week of recovery and two weeks at school . 'I had a lot of support at the start and by this point my friends had figured out what was going on and my school actually held a fundraiser for me,' Nicole said . 'But towards the end it got so tough, and I begged not to go into the last cycle. I was just so tired and drained.' In six months Nicole had put on 27 kilograms from the treatment and had lost her hair. She used a wig in her natural red hair colour and would rarely let anyone see her without it on. 'It was a huge blow to my social life and how I felt about my appearance. I always tried to be strong for myself but it was very hard,' she said. 'I remember asking my dad, ""how can you love me? How can anyone love me?"". I had no hair, I had put on a lot of weight.' Nicole said the chemotherpay was a huge blow to my social life and how she felt about her appearance . 'Towards the end of it I remember asking my dad, ""how can you love me? How can anyone love me?"". I had no hair, I had put on a lot of weight,' Nicole said . Once Nicole had completed the chemotherapy treatments she was no longer eligible to attend support groups, as she was technically not considered a 'cancer kid' any longer. 'I had that taken away from me, and then when I went to school I was the kid with cancer. I was excluded from both normalities,' she said. 'It took a lot of time for me to get used to myself and other people, which I actually consider harder than the treatment.' Four years on from her diagnosis, Nicole is preparing for her HSC and has dreams of working as a medical professional herself. While she said she has been very blessed with a group of loving friends and a great boyfriend, she said she still has to think about how the cancer will impact her future. The ovarian cancer means that she may not be able to have children in the future, a thought which she said it 'pretty crazy'. While Nicole said that she is still very conscious of her looks and how she presents herself to people .

'When I was going through the treatment I always just thought that I would worry about babies later. But realising that if I do find someone that I want to spend my life with and that I might not be able to give them or myself the life we want is scary,' Nicole said. The 16-year-old said that she is determined to 'do something great' with her life, and is passionate about raising awareness about ovarian cancer. 'I was dealt some pretty bad cards early in life and I'm adamant to turn it around and make the most of it,' Nicole said. While Nicole said that she is still very conscious of her looks and how she presents herself to people, she said it reminds her to be the best possible version of herself that she can be. 'I have had some amazing opportunities come from something not so great, and so I want to do something not just for me but for other people,' she said. Nicole is passionate about reminding cancer sufferers that there is always support available, no matter what they are going through. 'If I can help someone or if someone knows they're not alone in experiencing cancer, if I can bring comfort to help someone by sharing my story, then that's what this has all been about,' she said.

"Warrants for three Wesleyan University students arrested after a rash of illnesses on campus linked to the party drug Molly show police believe the bad batch of the drug originated in the Washington, D.C., area. The students, all neuroscience majors, were arraigned Wednesday in Middletown Superior Court, not far from the private college's campus. Superior Court Judge Leo V. Diana set bond at $50,000 for Eric Lonergan, 22, of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and 20-year-old Rama Agha Al Nakib, a Syrian citizen. Zachary Kramer, 21, of Bethesda, Maryland, was freed after posting a $5,000 bond. Eric Lonergan, left, and Rama Agha Al Nakib, right, are two of the four Wesleyan University students arrested Tuesday in connection with about a dozen hospitalizations among people who took a party drug known as Molly . Expected: Zachary Kramer, 21, of Bethesda, Maryland, is also due in court Wednesday . None of the three students entered pleas and their cases were continued to March 3. The fourth student who was arrested, Andrew Olson, of Atascadero, California, posted bail Tuesday and is due in court March 3. All four have been suspended from Wesleyan. Authorities said 11 people, including 10 Wesleyan students, some of whom had attended a rave music show Saturday night, received medical attention over the weekend. Two remain hospitalized. One of the victims was found unresponsive with no vital signs and was revived by paramedics who used six defibrillator shocks and numerous chest compressions, according to arrest warrant affidavits released Wednesday. Lawyers for Lonergan, Kramer and Al Nakib said Wednesday that no Molly was found in their clients' rooms on campus. But according to the affidavits, Al Nakib told police the 'bad Molly' came from Kramer, and witnesses told them it was purchased in Washington, D.C. The affidavits also cite a text conversation that references Kramer losing his usual supplier and going back to an old source. Jennifer Zito, Kramer's lawyer, asked the public to reserve judgment. 'These are very, very bright students, who have bright futures ahead of them and we certainly don't want to make any judgments at this time,' she said. Molly is a term used to describe a refined form of Ecstasy, a synthetic drug also known as MDMA. It can drive up body temperature and cause liver, kidney or cardiovascular failure. Prosecutors said authorities found numerous prescription drugs in Lonergan's room. Police also found more than 600 Xanax capsules and $310 in cash in Al Nakib's room, and nearly 200 nitrous oxide canisters, a scale and marijuana in Kramer's room, prosecutors said. Witnesses told police all four students sold Molly on campus, according to the affidavits. One witness told police she bought a bag of white powder from Olson on Friday and began feeling sick after consuming it. Olson established the Wesleyan chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy in 2013 and currently is co-president. The group advocates for changes to national drug laws that it describes as counterproductive. Authorities from various agencies were working to identify the different types of chemicals in the batch of Molly that caused the overdoses, Middletown Police Chief William McKenna said. 'This particular batch may have had a mixture of several kinds of designer drug chemicals, making the health risks unpredictable and treatment to combat the effects complex and problematic,' he said. Lonergan is accused of possessing a controlled substance and illegally obtaining or supplying drugs, while Olson faces charges of possessing and selling a hallucinogen. Kramer is accused of possessing drug paraphernalia, a regulated substance and a small amount of marijuana. Al Nakib is accused of possessing a controlled substance, a controlled substance with intent to sell it and drug paraphernalia. Eleven Wesleyan students, some of whom had attended a rave music show on Saturday night, received medical attention over the weekend, police said, and two students were still being treated . Dr. Mark Neavyn, chief of toxicology at Hartford Hospital, said users who believe they are taking Molly are often receiving different kinds of designer drugs, with ranges of purity and potency making the health risks unpredictable. The weekend rash of Molly hospitalizations wasn't the first such episode this year at the private university of nearly 3,000 students. Wesleyan health officials said in a campus-wide email on Sept. 16 that students had been hospitalized the previous two weekends after taking Molly. Students were urged to visit the university's health center if they had questions or concerns. The police chief said the safety and welfare of community members, including those on the Wesleyan campus, were his top priority. 'Incidents jeopardizing the safety will not be tolerated,' he said, 'and those offenders will be held accountable.'","Three of four Wesleyan University students appeared Wednesday on drug charges related to about a dozen hospitalizations .

"Bridges boasting dramatic waterfalls, sweeping cycle lanes and vibrant light displays are just three of the ideas that have been submitted as part of an international competition to design a new crossing over the Thames. Dozens of proposals have been put forward as part of the contest, which called on architects and engineers to create a creative and practical route between Nine Elms, in Battersea, on the South Bank, and Pimlico on the north side of the river. And now Wandsworth Council, which is organising the competition, is inviting Londoners to vote on the 74 proposals to help jurors decide on which designs will make it through to the next stage of the process. The designs, which are being showcased online and at local exhibitions, are now undergoing a detailed technical assessment. Next month, the jury panel will recommend a shortlist of up to four teams to go through to the next  stage and to develop more detailed plans. There are currently five possible sites for the new bridge. The most likely option, according to a brief by Transport for London, will stretch from just south St George's Square in Pimlico to near the new site for the US Embassy in Battersea. The proposed scheme, which will cost an estimated £40million is being hailed as a much-needed transport link by officials south of the river. But is facing opposition from Westminster City Council, who argue it will be detrimental to the local environment. Oasis: This proposed design would see pedestrians climb along the edge of a dramatic waterfall, bringing a touch of fantasy to the Thames . Futuristic: One of the bridge designs in the international competition features three separate paths that weave and curve across the river . Striking: This unusual design has a multi-coloured structure built above and alongside the cycle and pedestrian crossing . Vibrant: Massive pink spirals around the bridge would be mounted with bright pink lights - allowing the bridge to twinkle after dark . Proposed sites: The exact location of the bridge has not been chosen, but option one or option two are most likely, according to officials . Angular: This proposed design would be supported by a series of interlinking metal structures that would reach to the riverbed . Simple: This more streamlined design offers two separate routes for pedestrians and cyclists to avoid congestion along the bridge . Iconic: If the above design was chosen, the large curved structure would add a striking mark to the ever-changing landscape of south London . Sweeping: This design allows cyclists and pedestrians to enjoy winding ramps up to the main crossing, with benches incorporated on land . Sleek: This bridge extends out in a giant curve from the banks of the river, and incorporates strips of light that illuminate it after dark . Modern: This design, titled 'Crystal Bridge', will be illuminated by coloured lights embedded in the structure of the bridge after dark . Clean: This bridge design is defined by a large arch over the river, which supports suspension cables for the base below . Splash of colour: Red support pillars and beams brighten up this design, which has been submitted to the international competition . Green: This design incorporates attractive gardens dotted with flowerbeds and trees at the landing point of the bridge . Practical: This bridge ties together two elevated walkways - leaving pedestrians free to walk along the riverfront below . Two separate paths lead on to this bridge, which is built on a subtle curve and looks out on to Battersea Power Station (left) Dynamic: This twisted bridge transforms from brown to rainbow-coloured as it stretches across to the South Bank . Stylish: It is not clear how the bridge connects to the ground in this design, but it would offer users impressive views of the city . Attention to detail: Images inset in this  design offer a close-up view of the landing points and the bridge's tension ribbon and arch structure . Seamless: Glass and metal combine to create this light and airy design, which gives users plenty of opportunity to admire the views . Sculptural: This streamlined design rises elegantly off the banks of the river - and incorporates eyecatching art installations at either end . Fluid: In this design, the bridge curves upwards from the ground to form a wide road across the water, with designated cycle routes . Minimalist: In this innovative design, the bridge is suspended over the water as if unsupported, offering unobstructed views across the city .","£40million crossing will connect Nine Elms, on the South Bank, with Pimlico on the northern side of the Thames .
Waterfalls, vibrant light displays and sweeping cycle paths are included in proposed designs from around the globe .

It is now inviting Londoners to vote on which designs will make it through to next stage of the contest ."
"The wedding night of a couple in Iraq was made extra memorable for all the wrong reasons when Iraqi Special Forces kicked down the front door of their Baghdad home. The bride fainted and commandos told the husband that he was under arrest – for being a member of terrorist group Isis. The police were tipped off that the husband was a senior member of Isis by an unnamed woman in her 40s. The wedding night of a couple in Iraq was made extra memorable for all the wrong reasons when Iraqi Special Forces kicked down the front door of their Baghdad home . She told them that he had been plotting terrorist attacks while in Mosul and was hoarding explosives, quoted Police Colonel Salam Ahmed said, according to albawaba.com. However, the police quickly discovered that he had been framed, as he was happily enjoying his first night as a married man with his new wife. The wedding reception had only finished an hour before. Officers subsequently grilled the man’s former wife, who they discovered had falsely accused him as a means of exacting revenge. She was arrested for making the false accusation and wasting police time. The incident follows the news that a Swedish couple were mistaken for Islamic State supporters when passers by mistook the birthday balloons in the window saying '21' as 'IS' - an abbreviation for the terrorist group. They were in the window for Sarah Ericsson's birthday party held at her boyfriend's house last weekend according to Kvalls Posten, who reported the police came knocking on Monday. Someone then saw the balloons from outside Fabian Akesson's home in Karlskrona and reported it as Islamic State propaganda. He was brushing his teeth when he noticed several police cars parked outside the house before there was knock on the door minutes later. Mr Akesson added: 'I laughed about it and even showed them a picture that we took. And from that perspective, it looked almost like the letters 'IS'.' Despite the huge misunderstanding, the couple were still asked to take down the balloons to avoid further attention being drawn to their house.

"A migration brain drain has left Britain with a workforce in which millions cannot understand arithmetic, a study found. Nearly 700,000 highly numerate Britons have left the country for a life abroad since the mid-1960s, figures published yesterday show. Meanwhile, almost two-and-a-half million people arrived in the UK with few skills and low levels of numeracy. The large number of low-skilled arrivals – compared to a far smaller group of highly numerate immigrants – has brought down the average skill level of Britain’s workforce, a new study shows. Pictured are migrants in Calais . The large number of low-skilled arrivals – compared to a far smaller group of highly numerate immigrants – has brought down the average skill level of Britain’s workforce, the Institute of Education found. Its report said that as a result of the population changes, one in four of the adults in Britain that do not fully understand numbers are immigrants. The findings undermine claims that mass immigration has brought in much-needed skilled professionals to help the economy. Instead, a large proportion of incoming migrants have been people more likely to take low-paid jobs. Many of the low-skilled migrants have come from South Asia and Africa, while highly educated arrivals predominantly come from South Asia and Europe, the report said. The study, published in advance of the release of new immigration statistics today, was based on figures from 24 countries gathered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Its research covered 166,000 people – nearly 9,000 of them living in Britain. In a numeracy test, emigrants from Britain scored 268 points, while people who moved neither out of nor into the country scored just lower – 267. However, immigrants into Britain scored an average of 234. The Institute of Education found that between the mid-1960s and 2011 there were 684,000 highly numerate Britons who left the country. An almost equal number of mathematically skilled immigrants arrived in Britain – but a further 2.4million came with poor numeracy skills. Study author Dr John Jerrim said: ‘Immigrants account for one in four of the 9.6million working-age adults living in the UK with low-level numeracy skills. Immigration has therefore had its biggest impact upon the bottom end of the numeracy skill distribution; it has led to a significant increase in the supply of low-skilled workers.’ The study found skilled British workers often found better paid jobs abroad. Those who left for the US and Australia were earning on average £2,580 a month in 2011 – roughly £500 more than their counterparts in Britain.","Britain has a workforce in which millions cannot understand arithmetic .

"If you're an Alessandro, Lorenzo or Romeo, your name alone may just be enough to sweep someone off their feet. And the same goes for Scarlett, Nicolette, Natalia, Anaïs and Paulina, who have all been voted as having the world's sexiest names in a five year study. Bobs, Gertrudes, Berthas and Normans, however, have less luck when it comes to convincing people of their passionate side, according to the research. Actors Alessandro Nivola (left) and Scarlett Johansson (right) have the sexiest names, according to a recent study. The results were collated by Laura Wattenberg, founder of BabyNameWizard.com . The results were collated by Laura Wattenberg, founder of New York-based BabyNameWizard.com who asked tens of thousands of visitors to rate names for sexiness. The top 10 contenders for boys' and girls' names shared a number of characteristics that inspired feelings of sensuality and passion, Wattenberg wrote in her blog. Many of the male names end in 'O,' and many of the female names end in 'a.' Female names, such as Nicolette and Alessandra, also have double. 'Italian names make a strong showing on the girls' list, but French comes to the fore as well,' said Wattenberg. Italian names make a strong showing on the girls' list, but French comes to the fore as well. On the left is actor Lorenzo Lamas and the right image shows Miss Universe Paulina Vega, who both has sexy names . Rhett and Scarlett  can be found in Margaret Mitchell's 'Gone with the Wind.' Pictured are the characters Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler in the 1939 film Gone with the Wind played by Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh . 'The French girls' choices add a saucy flavor, with the flouncy diminutive Nicolette and the literarily erotic Anaïs.' Wattenberg said that exotic names also have an element of fantasy, which is why they are often chosen for perfumes or lingerie brands. Literature also has an impact on how we view names with Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' inspiring the top 10 list for boys. Rhett and Scarlett, meanwhile, can be found in the pages of Margaret Mitchell's 'Gone with the Wind.' 'One thing that leaps out at you is that we do have a mostly American and English-speaking user base, and Americans still have the image of the Latin lover,' Wattenberg told Live Science. 'These names are Italian and Spanish and French. You can even go Russian, with Dmitri.' The name Bob is common compared to the names on the 'sexy' list and so many people many not consider it to be exciting or romantic, Wattenberg said. The least sexy girls' names are largely old-fashioned, with double consonants in the middle, as in Gertrude and Mildred. The site that conducted the study doesn't collect demographic data on the users, but includes users worldwide. Pictured on the left is Ethel Kennedy, widow of Senator Robert Kennedy, and on the right singer Bob Dylan. Their names were both voted as among the least sexiest in the world . If you're a Mildred or a Howard, there is still hope. 'Sexiness isn't a universal positive in a name,' wrote Wattenburg. 'Every name style comes with trade-offs, and what sounds good on a lingerie label may not serve as well for a salesperson or aspiring politician.' These results are based on ratings from Namipedia visitors, the majority of whom are female. 'It's certainly possible that an all-male panel would choose differently,' said Wattenburg. 'Yet the girls' style, including Italian and French names and double letters, does line up with a style heavily favoured by the adult entertainment industry for targeting male customers. 'As for male names designed to appeal to a gay male audience, one 2005 study found a proponderance of simple boy-next-door stage names like Tom and Mark.' Many of the male names end in 'O,' and many of the female names end in 'a.'

"As the General Election looms, Natalie Bennett has become a regular on TV news shows, pontificating about why Britain needs ‘a peaceful political revolution’. And her message has found an audience, especially among young voters alienated by what they see as the abject failures of politicians in the two main parties. But not many are aware how hard-Left Bennett’s policies are: a desire to ban the monarchy, the House of Lords and much of the Armed Forces, and to make illegal the sale of fur and ‘cruel’ foods such as foie gras – while also introducing laws which would lead to more drug-use, laxer border controls, legal brothels and make it lawful to join terror groups such as Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who admitted suffering an 'excruciating mind blank' during a car-crash interview with Nick Ferrari on LBC in which she appeared unable to answer questions about key policies . And while Bennett loves to talk of her opponents’ ‘economic illiteracy’, her own illiteracy when questioned about her policies is utterly embarrassing. After being eviscerated on TV recently by Andrew Neil, when he forensically ripped apart her naive, uncosted soundbites, and now by Nick Ferrari on radio, Bennett has been exposed as a poor media performer who is lamentably weak on policy detail – although in truth, some of her party’s core demands are pretty difficult to defend. A Labour ex-minister who has shared a podium with her says: ‘She’s just not up to the job – you have to have a grasp of detail to survive an election campaign. 'She displays a lack of coherence, clarity and credibility that is ridiculous for a party contesting a General Election.’ So who is this bombastic blonde Australian who wants to reshape Britain? Bennett was born in 1966 to teenage parents in a working-class suburb of Sydney. Her father was an apprentice carpenter and her mother a part-time secretary. Bennett claims her conversion to feminism occurred – along with a determination to change the world – at the age of five when her grandmother refused to let her have a bicycle. ‘I was told that polite ladies did not ride bikes,’ she has said. ‘I was also told similar things later when I wanted to play rugby.’ Bennett has been accused of lacking 'coherence, clarity and credibility' by a Labour ex-minister . Bennett has said that she also decided around the same time that she did not want children – a vow she has kept. Bennett studied agricultural science at university, but by the end of her course, she had changed her mind and set her heart on journalism, becoming the solitary reporter on a small paper serving an agricultural town of 1,000 people. Like many young Australians, she then decided to go backpacking around Europe. But tragedy struck aged 23 when her mother died in a car crash. She returned to Oz for three years to support her father, but had already decided to leave Australia for good. She has since said her native country seemed small-minded and ‘anti-intellectual’, even telling one interviewer: ‘I can’t imagine going there by choice.’ Settling in Britain 16 years ago after a spell of voluntary work in Thailand, she spent six years working as a sub-editor on The Times and The Independent, finally ending up as editor of Guardian Weekly. Newspaper colleagues remember her powerful ‘honking’ voice and strident opinions. (One of her more absurd views is that England’s football team should not play against nations with nasty governments.) As a New Year’s Resolution on January 1, 2006, she joined the Green Party as part of a promise to herself to get involved in politics. Bennett at the launch of the Green Party election campaign on Tuesday. She won the party leadership in 2012 . Rapidly, she made waves at her local Camden branch in North London with her devotion to the cause. ‘She was one of those brilliant new members who volunteer to do lots of things, as well as having a terrific strategic brain and being very well-organised,’ said one fellow member. Eventually, in 2012, she stood as party leader – seeing off three rivals to win 60 per cent of the 3,000-member vote and thus becoming the first Australian-born head of a political party in Britain. It was her first significant electoral success for she had already failed to win a council seat in Camden and got a paltry 2.7 per cent of the vote when she fought the safe Labour seat of Holborn and St Pancras in 2010. She is standing again in the seat in May and lives in the same area of London with her partner Jim Jepps, a freelance political campaigner who writes occasionally for the extreme-Left Morning Star newspaper. Bennett is credited with strengthening a previously chaotic party organisation which has led to party membership soaring from 20,000 in October to more than 50,000. Only time – and the election in May – will tell if this support melts away again, just as it did after the Greens won 15 per cent of the vote in the 1989 European elections. But one thing is certain. This ambitious Australian will have to make a much better fist of explaining her policies if she has any hope of radically transforming her new nation – which many fear would result in the economy being wrecked and much-loved traditions destroyed. Politicians have a history of saying things on tape that they later regret. During the 2010 General Election campaign, former prime minister Gordon Brown was recorded talking about voter Gillian Duffy being a ‘bigoted woman’ after she asked him a question about immigration. Mr Brown had left the campaign event but had left a TV microphone on as he travelled in his car. In 2009, David Cameron said ‘too many tweets might make a t**t’ in a radio interview. He compounded the slip-up when he said he was sorry if people were ‘p***ed off’. Last year former Tory minister David Mellor was taped calling a taxi driver a ‘sweaty, stupid little s**t’. In 2006, Tony Blair’s wife Cherie denied claims she had uttered ‘that’s a lie’ as Mr Brown heaped praise on her husband during a party conference speech. Then Prime Minister Gordon Brown with Gillian Duffy in Rochdale. His subsequent gaffe, when he was recorded branding her a 'bigoted woman', did massive damage to his election campaign .","Green Party leader has found an audience among young voters alienated by what they see as the failures of politicians in the two main parties .

"More than 1,500 Yazidi women seized by Islamic extremists in Iraq are being forced to 'marry' their captors, it was claimed today. Witnesses in the town of Sinjar say Al Qaeda-inspired Islamic State fighters separated the younger women from the rest of the local population and most were shunted off in buses or trucks. It is believed to be an attempt to co-opt them into service as the wives of fighters. Up to 3,000 women and girls have been kidnapped by the jihadis in the north of the country in just a fortnight - and hundreds of men who refuse to convert have been shot dead. The kidnappings appear to have happened in villages where residents took up arms against IS - and the women are being held separately from the men in IS-controlled Tal Afar, east of Mount Sinjar.

He added that the abductions happened after residents tried to resist the IS attack, telling AFP: ‘Of course we tried to defend our villages, but they had much bigger weapons. ‘All we had were our Kalashnikovs. They executed 300 men, and took the women to their prisons.  Only God can save them now.’ Their children, said Mr Solo, were rescued by the family.

But there is no mama, we tell them.’ His comments on the dire situation came as Islamic extremists shot dead scores of Yazidi men, lining them up in small groups and opening fire with assault rifles before seizing their wives and children. 'The victims are of all ages, from babies to elderly men and women. It seems they took away entire families, all those who did not manage to flee. We fear the men may have been executed' Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International . A Yazidi politician cited the mass killing in Kocho as evidence that his people were still at risk after a week of US and Iraqi air strikes on the militants. Meanwhile, warplanes targeted insurgents around a large dam that was captured by the IS extremist group earlier this month. US Central Command said the strikes were launched under the authority to support humanitarian efforts in Iraq, as well as to protect US staff and facilities. Central Command says the nine air strikes conducted so far had destroyed or damaged four armoured personnel carriers, seven armed vehicles, two Humvees and an armoured vehicle. The US began strikes against IS a week ago, in part to prevent the massacre of tens of thousands of Yazidis in northern Iraq.

Displaced Iraqi Christians and Yazidis settle at the Diocese of Zakho, 300 miles north-west of Baghdad, Iraq . They fled the militants by scrambling up a barren mountain, where they became stranded. Most were eventually able to escape with help from Kurdish fighters. IS fighters surrounded the nearby village 12 days ago and demanded that its Yazidi residents convert or die. On Friday afternoon, they moved in. 'All we had were our Kalashnikovs. They executed 300 men, and took the women to their prisons. Only God can save them now' Dakhil Atto Solo, relative of kidnapped women . The militants told people to gather in a school, promising they would be allowed to leave Kocho after their details were recorded, said an eyewitness and the brother of the Kocho mayor, Nayef Jassem. The militants separated the men from the women and children under 12. They took men and male teens away in groups of a few dozen each and shot them on the edge of the village, according to a wounded man who escaped by feigning death. The fighters then walked among the bodies, using pistols to finish off anyone who appeared to still be alive, the 42-year-old man said from an area where he was hiding. ‘They thought we were dead, and when they went away, we ran away. We hid in a valley until sundown, and then we fled to the mountains,’ he said. Displaced Yazidis who fled the violence in the Iraqi town of Sinjar march in a demonstration at the Iraqi-Turkish border crossing in Zakho district of the Dohuk Governorate of the Iraqi Kurdistan province . Demonstrators demanded protection and evacuation from Iraq to safer areas such as Europe and the US . A Yazidi politician, a Kurdish security official and an Iraqi official from the nearby city of Sinjar gave similar accounts, saying Islamic State fighters had massacred many Yazidi men on Friday after seizing Kocho. 'They thought we were dead, and when they went away, we ran away. We hid in a valley until sundown, and then we fled to the mountains' Man who escaped from militants . All said they based their information on the accounts of survivors. Their accounts matched those of two other Yazidi men, Qassim Hussein and Nayef Jassem, who said they spoke to other survivors. It was not clear precisely how many men were killed. Iraqi and Kurdish officials said at least 80 men were shot. Yazidi residents said they believed the number was higher, because there were at least 175 families in Kocho, and few were able to escape before the militants surrounded their hamlet. Yesterday Britain deployed a US-made spy plane over northern Iraq to monitor the humanitarian crisis and movements of the militants. The converted Boeing KC-135 tanker, called a Rivet Joint, was monitoring mobile phone calls and other communication.","Islamic State militants have kidnapped more than 1,500 women in Sinjar .

"The secret of whether a woman is expecting a boy or a girl may lie in her scent. Research shows that lemur mothers-to-be carrying male babies smell differently to those carrying girls. The study, published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, is the first to make such a link. The researchers swabbed 12 ring-tailed lemurs (pictured) to come up with their amazing findings . And the US researchers say the same could be true in people. The scientists from Duke University in North Carolina swabbed 12 ring-tailed lemurs before and during pregnancy. Chemical analysis showed that the hundreds of ingredients behind the musky smell mellowed during pregnancy. And the biggest change occurred in those who went on to have male babies. It is thought that ‘dramatic’ differences in the mother-to-be’s hormones affected the mother’s scent. Chemical analysis showed the hundreds of ingredients behind the musky smell mellowed during pregnancy . It isn’t known why lemurs carrying males make simpler odours. But it may be a way of conserving energy because male pregnancies tend to take more out of the body. Asked whether the same might apply in women, researcher Christine Drea said: ‘There has been a study showing that women’s scent changes with pregnancy, but the authors did not address the issue of foetal sex and scent. ‘Also unknown is whether others would actually be able to detect the changes. ‘But, in broad strokes, yes, there is reason to believe that there may be similar mechanisms across primates, including humans.’ Duke University scientists say the same difference in the smell of pregant females could be true in people .","Study has been published in Royal Society journal Biology Letters .

"It may be 140 million miles from Earth, but it appears Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover is still subject to taking part in the same fads as those it left behind on its home planet. Nasa has released a new 'selfie' sent back by the robotic planetary explorer as it trundles over a rocky outcrop on the surface of the red planet. Captured from the end of the rover's robotic arm, the scene was stitched together by combining dozens of pictures taken by a camera designed for analysing rocks. Scroll down for video . This selfie of Nasa's Curiosity rover above was stitched together from dozens of images to crop out the robotic arm used to take the image . The resulting image reveals Curiosity in high definition surrounded by the bleak and desert like landscape in the Pahrump Hills within the enormous Gale crater on Mars. Microsoft’s ‘HoloLens' headset, which allows wearers to see 3D images superimposed over their vision, may look like it belongs in a sci-fi film. And now Nasa has revealed the prototype technology will be used to enable its scientists to work virtually on Mars. The headset will work with OnSight software to give scientists a means to plan experiments on the red planet, with the help of the Curiosity rover. The software was developed jointly by the two companies, including a team at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The site is close to the base of Mount Sharp, or Aeolis Mons as it is also known, a 18,000 feet peak that rises from the centre of the Gale crater. To the left of the rover, two small holes in the rock - each about 0.63 inches across - created by Curiosity's sample collecting drill can be seen. One of the holes, which are known as the Mojave sample site, still has the grey rock powder around it that was collected by the rover. Curiosity has been taking regular samples with its drill from the slopes of Mount Sharp as scientists attempt to learn more about the history of the planet. A tyre tread left by Curiosity's 16 inch wide wheels can also be seen slightly higher up from the holes in the image. The robotic arm holding the Mars Hand Lens Imager, which captured the selfie, has been cropped out of the image by piecing together a mosaic of shots. Using wrist actions and turret rotations, the arm was able to produce a variety of angles to capture the image. It was actually taken over the course of three days, with the rover itself being photographed on 14 January 2015 and much of the background was captured on 29 January 2015. Frames showing the drill holes were taken on 31 January 2015. Like all good selfies, Curiosity is looking straight into the camera with the array of seventeen cameras in its 'head' that help it navigate. Behind the rover the peak of Mount Sharp can be seen on the horizon on the left, while the rim of the Gale crater stretches out to the right. This labelled image of Nasa's Curiosity's selfie shows the 18,000 feet tall Mount Sharp in the distance and the rim of the Gale Crater along with the drill sites (marked in yellow) where the rover has taken rock powder samples and some other distinctive landmarks identified by scientists . The image is so detailed it is possible to see the test hole and sample hole drilled by Curiosity at the Mojave site (left) and a tyre track (right) Directly below the rover on the right of the picture area a series of sites where further drill samples have been taken since this image was taken. Most recently Curiosity took samples at the distant Telegraph peak, which can be seen just over the rovers left shoulder. It is not the first selfie to be sent back from Mars by Curiosity - it has sent one back every year since arriving on Mars. Curiosity has sent back three previous selfies since arriving on the red planet, with the first taken after 84 days on the surface (left), the second taken in February 2013 reveals rock samples the rover had explored (middle) and the third taken in April 2014 next to sandstone rocks (right) The first taken on October 31 2012 after 84 days on the surface was composed of 55 separate images taken by the Mars Hand Lens Imager. Such pictures allow Nasa's engineers and scientsts to check on the health of the rover and see whether it is being effected by the thick red dust on the Martian surface. It also allows them to see the surrounding landscape to check for any nearby hazards that may pose a threat to the rover. Dr John Bridges, a reader in planetary science at Leicester University, said Curiosity was now in the Pahrump area of the crater. He said: 'The rock pavement is made of fine grained sediment, including from an ancient lake. Pahrump has told us that the lower part of Mt Sharp is composed largely of lake deposits. 'So this is really moving on our understanding of Mars and its ancient climate and habitability for microbial life. Say 10 years ago, we really had no firm evidence for lake deposits.'","Curiosity used its robotic arm to take dozens of images that were then stitched together to produce the final selfie .

And after eight hours of deliberation the jury awarded in favour of the Texas-based firm . Apple has now been ordered to pay Smartflash $532.9 million (£343 million) for infringing a total of three patents. The jury determined Apple had not only used Smartflash's patents without permission, but did so willfully. Smartflash filed its first patent infringement against the tech giant in May 2013. A jury in California recently found in favour of Apple in a billion-dollar class-action lawsuit over the price of its iPod music players . A jury in California recently found in favour of Apple in a billion-dollar class-action lawsuit over the price of its iPod music players. Apple had argued the software provided necessary security protection. The jury rejected claims Apple's use of restrictive software froze out rival portable music player manufacturers. The jury said Apple's iTunes 7.0, released in the fall of 2006, was a 'genuine product improvement,' meaning that new features were good for consumers. It said that patent owner and co-inventor Patrick Racz met with a firm called Gemplus - now known as Gemalto - to discuss the technology. One of people at this meeting was Augustin Farrugia who is currently a senior director at Apple. The filing accused Apple of using technology covered by Smartflash’s patents to create and develop its iTunes software. Despite the win, however, Smartflash had been asking for $852 million (£550 million). ‘Smartflash is very happy with the jury's verdict, which recognises Apple's longstanding willful infringement,’ said Brad Caldwell, a lawyer for Smartflash. But Apple has said it will appeal, adding the outcome was another reason reform was needed in the patent system to curb litigation by companies that don't make products themselves. ‘We refused to pay off this company for the ideas our employees spent years innovating and unfortunately we have been left with no choice but to take this fight up through the court system,’ Apple said in a statement. The trial was held in Tyler which over the past decade has become a focus for patent litigation. It was in Tyler federal court that a jury in 2012 ordered Apple to pay $368 million (£237 million) to VirnetX for patent infringement. But a federal appeals court later threw out that damages figure, saying it was wrongly calculated. Smartflash filed its first patent infringement (shown) against the tech giant in May 2013.

Apple had asked the jury to find Smartflash's patents invalid because previously patented inventions covered the same technology.

She was sectioned in December that year after trying to commit suicide, and made several more attempts on her life until April 2014, when police said they were dropping their investigation. She discharged herself from the hospital where she was staying in the morning of May 31 last year, and her body was found near train tracks on Hayling Island, Hampshire, at around midday. Dog walker Simon Lown told the inquest into her death: 'Something caught my eye. It was a bright pink hoody about 50 metres away. 'You often see children playing in that area and at first I thought she was playing hide and seek. As I walked past I saw the person was not moving at all and I thought something was not right. 'I shouted at her, ""is everything alright?"" and I got no response.' An inquest at South Hampshire Coroner's Court (pictured), heard that Miss Keating attempted to kill herself 37 times until April 2014, when police dropped their probe into her claims. She was found dead in May . Paramedics were called, but she was pronounced dead at the scene. Speaking to Leya's adoptive parents, Mr Lown added: 'I am only sorry I did not find her sooner.' The inquest, taking place in Portsmouth, heard that Miss Keating had four siblings who used to live in Huddersfield. Miss Keating's birth mother, Marie Sharpe, told the coroner that her marriage to Miss Keating's biological father broke down after he became violent. She said: 'We lived for many years as a family unit but my marriage broke down due to violence. 'It ended up with me being hospitalised on a weekly basis. The situation escalated and I lost my children, which to this day I regret.' However Miss Keating remained in contact with her birth father, and alleges that it was during this time she was sexually abused by him and his new partner. She was taken into care, and in 2002 was sent to live with her adoptive parents, Thomas and Louise Keating, who described her as a 'boisterous, wonderful girl.' Mr Keating said: 'We adopted Leya and her sister. They were wonderful children. Leya was super fit, she loved to play football with the lads, she was boisterous and extremely good at sport. 'She qualified as a kayaking instructor aged 14. Sometimes she was hard work but she had a BTech in sport from college. 'When she was 16 she started talking about joining the police force. We went to a talk and someone did a speech about the Navy. 'Leya said she thought that was more suited to her, she loved boats and sailing and wanted to be a master seaman.' Miss Keating then joined the Navy in 2010 and left home for Plymouth before moving to Portsmouth after her passing-out parade in 2011. However in 2012 he life began to unravel after she confessed to her adoptive family that she had suffered sexual abuse as a child when she began suffering flashbacks. Just months later she was sexually assaulted while in the sick bay of a Royal Navy base by a fellow patient, who was subsequently jailed. She also phoned her adoptive mother that same year and told her she had been discharged from the Navy after injuring her foot. Mr Keating said: 'She had a boyfriend in Portsmouth and wanted to make a new start for herself. 'Maybe she felt she had let us down and could not move back. Her life seemed to be getting more and more chaotic.' Her historic allegations of abuse were reported to police in July 2012, but in December she tried to kill herself for the first time. Detective Sergeant Simon Clacey, of Hampshire Police, said: 'There were 37 reports to the police between April 2013 and April 2014. 'She attempted to take her own life on numerous occasions, she took overdoses, threatened to jump off bridges and walked into the path of moving cars and trains.' Miss Keating had been in contact with birth mother Marie Sharpe since 2010, and in 2013 she messaged Ms Sharpe to say she had been sectioned. She added: 'Things seemed to escalate quite rapidly from that point. 'I got a phone call one evening saying she was on Portsmouth Bridge and she was saying goodbye to me, saying she was having flashbacks. I managed to talk her down.' In April 2014, Miss Keating was told police would not be taking any further action over the sexual abuse she was said to have suffered as a child. Det. Sgt. Clacey told the inquest: 'That wasn’t because she wasn’t believed, but because there was no corroborating evidence.' At the time of her death, the 21-year-old was a patient at a psychiatric hospital but was allowed out alone for a few hours to get some fresh air. Nicholas Edmonds, a nurse at Elmleigh Hospital in Havant, said in a statement read to the inquest: 'Leya had an emotionally unstable personality disorder. 'On May 31, I gave her medication for anxiety and she asked for a self-discharge form. 'She told me nothing was working for her and it was pointless her being in hospital, but she expressed no suicidal thoughts to me. 'Because she had expressed no suicidal thoughts, it was agreed she could leave.' The inquest heard Leya was told to keep her phone with her but she ignored calls from the hospital. Sonny Ogundele, who had worked as a mental health nurse at the hospital since 2007, told the inquest Leya had been a patient from February 2014 up until her death three months later. He said: 'On April 10, Leah was expressing thoughts to self-discharge. She was let out into the garden but she ended up on the roof. 'She moved across the roof to the front of the hospital and started threatening to jump off. 'I was trying to talk her out of jumping. She had put a ligature around her neck and staff went up there with the fire brigade. 'This was a reaction to being restricted. She improved with more leave. She was taken off the section and transferred to an open ward. 'She went out on her own several times without any problems. 'On May 31, Nick was doing the meds and he told me that Leya was getting agitated. He talked to her and told me she was asking for a self-discharge form. 'She wanted to go out and get fresh air, which she had done several times before. We discussed our previous knowledge and experience of Leya and what we had done for her in the past. 'She was still positive about the progress she was making.' The inquest heard she had self-harmed in the early hours of the morning she was allowed out. Mr Ogundele said: 'If we keep her in, she becomes more agitated. It is about being restricted. When she left, she was not agitated. Mr Edmonds has carried out risk assessments several times.' South East Hampshire coroner David Horsley asked: 'He came and discussed it with you and you left him it to him as he had done it before' Mr Ogundele replied: 'Yes.' A statement from psychiatrist Dr Zaid Alabassi, said Leya had been diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder when she was aged 19. She claimed she was sexually assaulted by her biological father and his partner, and was also sexually assaulted by a man while in the sick bay during her time at the Royal Navy. The statement read: 'Leya’s illness is characterised by repeat acts and threats of self-harm. 'She was discharged from the Navy on medical grounds. When she was in the sick bay, she was attacked by a fellow patient who went to prison. 'Her personality disorder arose from her traumatic upbringing.' Consultant psychiatrist Dr James Mcintyre was asked by Mr Horsley: 'Do you think if she had lived, there was a chance of recovery?' Dr Mcintyre replied: 'She had a lot of strength and was a likeable person. 'She had powerful emotions. When her frame of mind was not focused on activities she enjoyed, she could go to a negative place. I think the second sexual assault destabilised things for her.' The inquest was adjourned until tomorrow.","Leya Keating, 21, was found hanged beside train tracks in May last year .

"A farmer's daughter dubbed the ‘Cowshed Cinderella’ who said she was left at home to do chores while her sisters went dancing won £1.3million from her parents yesterday. Eirian Davies, 45, was awarded the compensation by the High Court for the 30 years of work she put in on the farm and for losing out on her young days of freedom. But in yet another twist in the bitter and long-running legal battle, her parents Tegwyn, 75, and Mary Davies, 76, are now seeking leave to appeal, so she is still yet to receive a penny. Eirian Davies, pictured, was awarded £1.3million for her 30 years' work she put in on her parent's farm . Eirian Davies (pictured), 45, nicknamed the 'Cowshed Cinderella', who says she stayed at home to milk the cows while her sisters went out partying has won a £1.3million payout from her parents . The dispute centres on the Welsh family’s 800-acre dairy farm in Carmarthenshire. Miss Davies had been assured that she would ultimately take it over, along with its pedigree milking herd, when her parents retired. But following a row her parents began proceedings to evict her, and she then launched a legal campaign for her ‘rightful share’ of Caeremlyn Farm. Her claims included missing out going to Young Farmers’ Club dances as a teenager with her sisters, Enfys and Eleri, as she stayed at home to look after the cows. Miss Davies won her case and last year a challenge by her parents was dismissed by the Appeal Court. Yesterday a figure – £1.3million – was for the first time set on the amount she deserved by the High Court in Cardiff. She told the original hearing: ‘They always told me that the farm would be left to me. Even on my birthday, when the other girls were having things, they would say, “You will have the damn lot one day, it will all be yours”.’ She said her sisters once paraded through the poultry shed in their ball gowns while she prepared turkeys for Christmas. Her father would regularly warn her ‘not to kill the goose that lays the golden egg’ if she complained about her treatment. Miss Davies said she was assured by her parents Tegwyn, 75, (right) and Mary, 76, (left) that she would eventually take over the dairy farm in Carmarthenshire and its milking herd after working for years for free . Miss Davies said she missed out on going to Young Farmers' Club dances with her two sisters, Enfys and Eleri, as a teenager because she had to stay at home to deal with her chores at Caeremlyn Farm (pictured) Miss Davies claimed that until she reached the age of 21, she was paid nothing for her work and, after that, there was a period when she was paid just £15 a day for milking the cows, although sometimes she received more. The court heard that she had a ‘passionate interest’ in the herd, and by 1989 was the only daughter at the farm after her sisters began other careers. When Miss Davies left to work elsewhere her father begged her to return to the farm. But although her parents had ‘pinned their hopes’ on their hardworking daughter, over the years they became increasingly annoyed by her relationships with men and the prospect of her having children. Tegwyn and Mary Davies are photographed outside the Royal Courts of Justice, in London . Lord Justice Floyd, sitting at the Appeal Court, said this concern was not so much the men involved but ‘any children that they had and how that may impact upon their duties to keep the business in the family’. He said: ‘Her mother referred to a string of men, to whom she referred as “wretches”, with kids behind them.’ Miss Davies claims she was shown a draft will in 2009 that left the lion’s share of the farm to her. But her parents subsequently proposed to place the farm in trust for the benefit of all three sisters equally. Family relations hit rock bottom in August 2012 during an altercation in which milk was thrown over Miss Davies by her mother, and she and her father ended up wrestling on the floor, where she bit her father’s leg. It led to the legal battle in which Mr and Mrs Davies sought to evict their daughter from the farm cottage, where she still lives close to her parents’ farmhouse, while she fought for her share of the farm. The Appeal Court found Miss Davies had relied on her parents’ promises and thrown herself into working on the farm. She was thus entitled to a ‘beneficial interest’ in the business. Dismissing her parents’ appeal against the ruling, Lord Justice Floyd described the dispute as ‘in many ways a tragic case’. ‘The bitterness between the parties was such that each had few, if any, good words to say about the other,’ he said. ‘The fact remained, however, that between them they had over the years built up a prodigious Holstein pedigree milking herd and a highly successful business.’ It was ruled that the farm (pictured) was worth about £3.8 million and an 'appropriate award' for Miss Davies would be £1.3 million for her to start a farm of her own . Mr and Mrs Davies argued in court that compensation should be measured by a sum of money enabling their daughter to buy her own house. The court said this would not truly reflect Miss Davies’s suffering, nor the nature of the promise that she was made. It was ruled that the farm was worth about £3.8million and an ‘appropriate award’ for Miss Davies would be £1.3million for her to start a farm of her own. Outside court yesterday Miss Davies said: ‘My mother is now seeking leave to appeal against the judge’s decision. ‘I don’t think now would be the right time to talk. ‘I don’t care what anyone says, I know the truth. One day I will write a book.’ She added: ‘There are no winners in this situation.’ Wiljo Salen, partner at Hugh James solicitors in Cardiff, said: ‘I can say that Miss Davies is looking forward to concluding what has been a very hurtful and distressing period.’ Miss Davies’s parents declined to comment.","Eirian Davies, 45, launched legal battle for 'rightful share' of £3.8m farm .

"A police commissioner who created Britain's first youth crime tsars is set to drop the post after the role became mired in controversy. Kent police and crime commissioner Ann Barnes chose 17-year-old Paris Brown as the UK's first youth police and crime commissioner in April 2013. Miss Brown was forced to step down from the £15,000-a-year job just a week later after complaints about allegedly violent, racist and anti-gay comments on Twitter. Scroll down for video . Kerry Boyd, left, will stand down as Kent's youth crime tsar next week, while her boss Ann Barnes, right, has not yet made any announcement whether the £15,000-a-year role will continue following several controversies . Kent's first youth crime tsar, Kerry Brown, right, was forced to resign from the role in April 2013 after several allegedly racist, violent and homophobic Tweets she made before being appointed to the post resurfaced . Ms Barnes, who was elected to the £85,000-a-year post in 2012, has been embroiled in a string of controversies, including her decision to commission a special van - dubbed Ann Force One - pictured . But the girl that replaced her, 20-year-old Kerry Boyd, also attracted criticism. She had to be suspended in June last year when it emerged she had a close friendship with married ex-local councillor Robert Burgess, 50. Miss Boyd has since returned to her duties, liaising between the police and youth groups and charities. Since her reinstatement, Miss Boyd has travelled across Kent meeting school children, youth groups and sporting organisations. On her documentary: 'The only reason I agreed to do the documentary was to help people better understand the role of police and crime commissioner. It is very complex and there are lots of challenges. Unfortunately I don't think the programme did that and I'm deeply sorry'. When asked about  her job:'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not . the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner. 'It's . a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there . are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no actual job . description.' On . what her 'Crime Onion' meant: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell . you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion . (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - . everything's important.' On . her Ann Force One battle bus: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is . money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's . not my image.' Mrs Barnes was then seen driving her personal Mercedes. On resignation of Paris Brown: 'I was not recruiting an angel. I was not recruiting a police officer. I was recruiting a young person, warts and all. It is personally sad for Paris and her family' But her 12-month contract ends on March 5 and it is thought unlikely she will be replaced. Discussions are due to take place about an exact date for Miss Boyd's departure. There have so far been no moves to re-advertise the post publicly. A spokesman for the commissioner's office said: 'The exact arrangements around her last day have yet to be made, but there is no replacement lined up. 'Once Kerry has left, the commissioner will decide what to do. That decision has not been taken yet.' The post was originally set up so that the views of young people could be better represented in relation to policing in Kent. Writing on her blog, Ms Barnes said during her year in office, Miss Boyd completed 'an excellent piece of primary research' which is due to be published shortly. She said: 'I have already incorporated some of Kerry’s advice into the 2015/16 refresh of my Police and Crime Plan which sets the strategic direction for Kent Police.' Ms Barnes said the recommendations included officer and staff training around their interaction with young people. She also proposed that 'partners' should encourage the use of shared open spaces 'in a safe and not anti-social way'. Ms Barnes said her youth crime tsar also made recommendations on how to reach young people with crime prevention and safety messages. Miss Boyd is returning to University following her time in the role. The Crime Prosecution Service has announced that Ms Barnes will not face prosecution for driving without insurance despite finding 'she may have committed the offence'. The IPCC launched the probe after Ms Barnes was involved in a road traffic collision on September 16, on Princes Road, Dartford. At the time of the crash, Ms Barnes was driving her own personal car and investigators had to decide wither the she had obstructed a police officer 'in the execution of their duty'. A file on the incident was sent to the CPS who had to determine whether Ms Barnes had made a 'technical breach' of her insurance conditions because the collision happened on a trip between a shop and a meeting. A CPS spokesperson said: 'Although some further investigation might assist in determining whether there would be sufficient evidence to prosecute this matter, we are not advising that any further inquiries take place as in any event we consider that it would not be in the public interest to prosecute. 'The alleged breach of insurance conditions is technical in nature and focuses on whether the purpose of the trip could be defined as business or personal and we consider that to be far from clear. 'In this case the insurance company did not consider that the conditions of the insurance policy were breached so as to make any claim invalid, and has indicated it will pay the claim (although in fact the other party was deemed to be liable). 'It follows that we have advised there should be no prosecution.'","Youth crime tsar faces the axe following two years of controversies .

"Nato forces put on a show of strength  in Estonia, just yards from the Russian border, with troops, armoured personnel carriers and tanks forming a military parade. Around 100 British, Dutch, Spanish, Latvian and Lithuanian troops yesterday marched in the snow in the city of Narva, alongside some 1,300 Estonian soldiers, to mark the independence of the formerly Soviet-ruled republic, now a member of the European Union and Nato. Today Moscow responded by deploying thousands of soldiers on exercise just across Russia's borders with Estonia and Latvia. Russian President Vladimir Putin also lashed Ukraine's decision to cut off gas to its eastern regions, saying the move 'smacks of genocide'. Scroll down for video .

Pictured are US soldiers in M1126 Stryker armoured fighting vehicles . A US armoured vehicle just yards away from the Russian border in Narva . The display was held amid heightened tensions between Nato and Russia over Ukraine. Pictured are soldiers from the Netherlands in light tanks . The worsening tension across eastern Europe came as the U.S. bluntly accused Russia of 'lies' and Cold War-style propaganda over its involvement in the bloody conflict in east Ukraine which has claimed thousands of lives. Rhetoric was also hawkish in Estonia yesterday. 'History has taught us that if we do not defend ourselves, nobody else will,' General Riho Teras, Estonia's chief of staff, said at the parade. 'The events in Ukraine that have kept the entire world awake, demonstrate very clearly that we ourselves must maintain security,' he added. Putin this week began supplying gas direct to areas of eastern Ukraine which are now controlled by pro-Moscow rebels who are, the West allege, propped up by the Russian army. He lambasted Kiev for switching off gas to the region, notwithstanding Russian gas monopoly Gazprom's threat to cut Ukraine off entirely - a block which would affect Europe's pipeline supply. He lambasted Kiev for switching off gas to the region, even though Gazprom has threatened to block supplies to Ukraine, which could then hit Europe's pipeline deliveries. 'It's not enough that there's famine there and the OSCE has reported a humanitarian catastrophe, but then to switch off gas supplies too,' said Putin. 'What do you call that? That already smacks of genocide.' Estonian soldiers march in formation during a military parade on the occasion of Estonia's Independence Day, in Narva, Estonia - just 300 yards from the border with Russia . Soldiers of the Royal Dutch Armed Forces march in formation during the annual parade . Around 100 British, Dutch, Spanish, Latvian and Lithuanian troops marched in the snow in the city of Narva, alongside some 1,300 Estonian soldiers . The show of strength took place right on Putin's doorstep . Hot on the heels of Nato's part in Estonia's Independence Day parade in Narva, 2,000 Russian soldiers swooped on Pskov, the Russian region bordering the tiny Baltic state. Some 500 units of equipment took part in the drills, which continue until Saturday with 1,500 paratroopers parachuting en masse to capture and destroy a fictional enemy's airfield. Joining Nato's small international contingent in the Narva parade were two US Stryker armoured personnel carriers and a number of Dutch CV90 tanks. Nato has brought the equipment into the Baltics for a wave of exercises in response to Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and subsequent meddling in that country's east. The annual parade has taken on particular importance this year in the context of jitters in the Baltic countries. Holding the parade in Narva on the Russian border, where a majority of residents are ethnic Russian, was seen by commentators as sending a strong signal to Moscow about Nato's commitment to collective defence. The annual parade has taken on particular importance this year in the context of jitters in the Baltic countries . US Secretary of State John Kerry angrily accused Moscow of lying to his face over Russian involvement in Ukraine. 'They have been persisting in their misrepresentations - lies - whatever you want to call them, about their activities there to my face, to the face of others, on many different occasions,' he told US lawmakers. He said Russia was also engaging in 'a rather remarkable period of the most overt and extensive propaganda exercise that I've seen since the very height of the Cold War' Putin said the gas supplies to Ukraine would be halted if it failed to pay. Ukraine said it had stopped supplies to the country's east because of pipeline damage due to fighting. 'I don't know for sure whether the pipeline is damaged or not. What I do know is that about four million people live there,' said Putin.

Estonia's President Toomas Hendrik Ilves (centre right) inspects soldiers during the parade . General Adrian Bradshaw, Nato's Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe, said last week that Russia could try to seize territory from the alliance's states off the back of fighting in Ukraine. British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon reportedly also told journalists last week that there was a 'real and present danger' to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. However, few ethnic-Russian Narva locals who came to the parade seemed to echo fears of a Russian intervention. 'In my opinion national security is blown up by the press, it's nothing serious, everything is okay, no one is going to attack anyone,' said 55-year-old Yuri Melnikov. Elvira Neimann, 77, said she's been living in Narva since the end of the Second World War in 1945: 'I feel part of Estonia, not Russia.' 'We're all tolerant people, Russia is our friendly neighbour,' she told AFP. Lithuania said Tuesday it would return to limited conscription later this year as concern mounts over Russian military exercises near Nato Baltic states. The Soviet Union annexed the three small states during World War II. They won independence in 1991 and have had rocky ties with Moscow ever since. Lithuania has decided to restore compulsory military service for young men as tensions in Ukraine continue to worry the small Baltic nation. After a meeting of military leaders and top government officials, President Dalia Grybauskaite said Tuesday the measure was necessary because of 'growing aggression' in Ukraine. Military officials said Lithuania will reinstate national service for five years starting in September, when it will enlist some 3,000 men, ages 19 to 27. They will serve for nine months. General Jonas Vytautas, the defense chief, says a lack of soldiers posed a 'real threat' to national security. Lithuania, like its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia, was occupied for five decades by the Soviet Union before regaining independence in 1991. It abolished conscription in 2008, four years after joining Nato.","Nato soldiers and armour took part in a military parade in Estonia .

"This Catholic man holds one of the most incredible concentration camp escape stories of World War Two, after he sneaked his Jewish girlfriend out of Auschwitz in 1944 by dressing up as an S.S. officer. But it took Jerzy Bielecki, a German-speaking Polish inmate at the same Nazi death camp, 39 years to be reunited with Cyla Cybulska after a chance conversation she had with her cleaner in the 1980s. On Thursday Mr Bielecki - who was brought to Auschwitz aged just 19 on the false suspicion he was a resistance fighter - died peacefully in his sleep at his home in Nowy Targ, Poland, aged 90. Amazing story: Jerzy Bielecki, left, a Polish inmate who led his Jewish girlfriend Cyla Cybulska, right, out of Auschwitz in 1944, before they were later reunited 39 years on, died on Thursday aged 90 . Mr Bielecki was 19 when the Germans seized him and brought him to the notorious Auschwitz in April 1940 in the first transport of inmates, who were all Poles. He was given number 243. In July 1944 the 23-year-old Bielecki used his relatively privileged position at the concentration camp to orchestrate a daring escape for both of them. Ms Cybulska, her parents, two brothers and a younger sister were rounded up in January 1943 in the Lomza ghetto in northern Poland and taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Her parents and sister were immediately killed in the gas chambers, but she was sent to work with her brothers. By September, 22-year-old Cybulska was the only one left alive. Hero: Mr Bielecki - who was brought to Auschwitz aged just 19 on the false suspicion he was a resistance fighter - died peacefully in his sleep at his home in Nowy Targ, Poland, aged 90. He is pictured in May 2010 . She had inmate number 29558 tattooed on her left forearm. Ms Cybulska met Mr Bielecki and their love blossomed, making him determined to find a way to escape. 'I felt pain in my backbone, where I was expecting to be shot' Jerzy Bielecki . From a fellow Polish inmate working at a uniform warehouse, Mr Bielecki secretly got a complete S.S. uniform and a pass. Then dressed as an S.S. officer, he pretended he was taking a Jewish inmate out of the camp for interrogation. He led Ms Cybulska to a side gate, where a sleepy S.S.-man let them go through. The fear of being gunned down himself reverberated through his first steps of freedom. ‘I felt pain in my backbone, where I was expecting to be shot,’ he said last year in an interview. Concentration camp: Mr Bielecki was 19 when the Germans seized him and brought him to the notorious Auschwitz in April 1940 in the first transport of inmates, who were all Poles . For more than a week they hid in the fields during the day and marched during the night, until they reached the house of Mr Bielecki's uncle. The Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem awarded Mr Bielecki the Righteous Among the Nations title in 1985 for saving Ms Cybulska. This is a title awarded by the Holocaust memorial group on behalf of Israel and the Jewish people to non-Jews who risked their own lives to save those of Jews. They were separated there, as the family wanted Mr Bielecki back home in Krakow, and Ms Cybulska was sent to hide with a farm family. They failed to meet back up after the war. Mr Bielecki stayed in Poland and settled in Nowy Targ, where he raised a family and worked as the director of a school for bus and car mechanics. Ms Cybulska married a Jewish man, David Zacharowitz, with whom she went to Sweden and then to New York. Sheer chance allowed them to meet again - in a story almost as amazing as their escape in 1944. Escape: Dressed as an SS officer, Mr Bielecki pretended he was taking a Jewish inmate out of the camp for interrogation. He led Ms Cybulska to a side gate, where a sleepy SS-man let them go through .

In the summer of 1983, they met at the Krakow airport. He brought 39 red roses, one for each year they had spent apart. Ms Cybulska died in New York in 2002. Mr Bielecki is survived by his wife, two daughters, four grand-children and a great-grandson. His daughter Alicja Januchowski, of New York, confirmed his death to the media on Saturday. ‘He did not think he was a hero, but he was,’ Stanlee Stahl, a vice president at the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous. ‘He will be missed.’ A Catholic funeral and burial are to be held in Nowy Targ on Monday to remember Mr Bielecki's life.","Jerzy Bielecki escaped from Auschwitz with Jewish girlfriend Cyla Cybulska .

"Two wild teenagers paid the hefty price for a dangerous joyride in a tin boat that quickly turned sour when the authorities caught up with the daring duo. A police helicopter on a routine patrol spotted the two brazen youths shamelessly hooning along the Nerang river in Broadbeach Waters on the Gold Coast in Queensland at 11.30am on Wednesday. The boys, aged 14 and 15, can be seen flying along in the tinnie at a frightening pace while swerving from side to side and almost hitting the jetties of exclusive homes along the waterfront and narrowly missing a luxurious yacht moored on the foreshore.

The boys, aged 14 and 15, can be seen flying along in the tinnie at a frightening pace almost hitting the jetties of exclusive homes along the waterfront and narrowly missing a luxurious yacht moored on the foreshore . The boat was clocked travelling at 20 knots, or 37km/h, in a 6 knot (11km/h) 'wake-free' zone along the usually calm and quite river. After 15 minutes of reckless driving, the boat is seen gliding onto a sandy embankment before coming to an abrupt stop just metres from a parked bus alongside a busy road. The boys get out of the boat and make a run for it but the marine police officers catch up with them not too far from where they abandoned the tinnie. The 14 -year-old boy, who was driving the tinnie, was charged with speeding, driving unlicensed and not wearing a lifejacket.

"A couple who had been married for 67 years died just five hours apart at their farm in Easton, California, earlier this month. Floyd and Violet Hartwig had both suffered ill health in recent years, but with their beds pushed together the couple held hands until Floyd, 90, passed away first on February 11. Five hours later he was followed by his wife Violet, 89. Floyd and Violet Hartwig from Easton, California, began dating in the 1940s while Floyd was on leave from the Navy during World War II . 'We felt blessed because we knew that's what they wanted,' daughter Donna Scharton told The Fresno Bee. The couple first met in elementary school, but didn't began dating until the 1940s while Floyd was on leave from the Navy during World War II. While Floyd was away, the love-struck youngsters kept in touch through letters. The family still has 131 of the letters Floyd and Violet wrote to each other between 1946 and 1948. On at least one occasion, Floyd wrote to Violet five times in one day. 'Hi honey, just a few lines from this lonely blue sailor of yours. Miss you darling and so in love with you. … Honey, I'll sure be glad when I get out of this. 'It sure isn't for me, though at one time I thought the Navy was pretty swell. That was before I fell in love with the sweetest girl in the world,' he wrote in May 1947 while stationed in the Pacific. The couple married in August 1947, although it would be several months before Floyd was discharged from the Navy. In December 1947, newlywed Violet wrote to Floyd: 'Need your arms around me darling, hope it will be soon honey. All my love darling and take care of yourself. Love you, love you, and shall always love only you, honey, as long as I live. Your loving wife, forever.' Once reunited permanently the couple settled down to life on their 20-acre ranch and went on to have three children together: Donna, Carol and Kenneth. In their later years, Violet had dementia and suffered a number of strokes while Floyd battled colon and bladder cancer and eventually was diagnosed with kidney failure just two weeks before his death. Even though Floyd couldn't get around well towards the end, his wife was always his priority. 'He would tell the doctor, 'I'm OK, I want Vi fixed,'' their daughter recalled. Scharton got emotional when she told The Fresno Bee about the day of her parents joint funeral. 'When we went to the funeral home and saw the two caskets, it was meant to be,' she said. 'And that's the only way it could end.'","Floyd, 90, and Violet Hartwig, 89, passed away within five hours of each other on February 11 .

"In the event of a zombie apocalypse, making your way to the Rocky Mountains in the US might be your best bet for survival. A team of scientists at Cornell University have simulated a zombie outbreak in the US as a novel approach to studying infectious disease. Using statistical mechanics, the team led by Alex Alemi simulated millions of interactions between zombies and humans to predict the pace at which a fictional zombie virus might spread. ‘We build up to a full scale simulation of an outbreak in the United States, and discover that for realistic parameters, we are largely doomed,’ said the researchers in their paper. London would fall in days in the event of a zombie apocalypse, as would major cities in the US due to their population density. The north west of Scotland and the Rockies in the US would hold out for longest before the infection arrived, making them the perfect place to hide . Scroll down for video . Densely populated cities would fall to a zombie outbreak in a matter of days, according to a simulation built by researchers at Cornell University as a fun way to approach statistical mechanics and disease modelling (scene from film 28 Days Later pictured) While the study focuses on an imaginary disease, the techniques used are useful in modelling the spread of real infectious diseases. Cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco would become overrun with zombies within days, with less densely populated rural areas lasting a few weeks. But it would takes months for the infected to reach the northern Rockies, making the mountains an ideal hiding place to escape the undead hordes. ‘At their heart, the simulations are akin to modeling chemical reactions taking place between different elements and, in this case, we have four states a person can be in—human, infected, zombie, or dead zombie—with approximately 300 million people,’ Alemi told Phys.org. Run to the hills: it would take months for the infected zombies to reach the Rocky Mountains in the western United States, making the mountain range the best place to escape to. The model simulated millions of interractions between infected zombies and humans . The zombie apocalypse occurs in many different forms in zombie films. Space radiation – Night of the living dead . Chemical weapons – Return of the living dead . Biological infection – 28 days later, Resident evil . Genetic manipulation – Resident evil . Parasites – Zombie town . Magic – White zombie . Supernatural possession – Evil dead . Depression - Warm bodies . The simulation has built in randomness: interactions between zombies and humans can go either way. Sometimes the zombie bites the human victim, infecting them, and sometimes the human is victorious, living to fight another day. In this way, each interaction is treated like a radioactive decay, allowing the researchers to calculate the rate of spread throughout the United states where each event - for example the fall of a city - can affect the rate of spread. In fictional accounts, ‘if there is a zombie outbreak, it is usually assumed to affect all areas at the same time, and some months after the outbreak you're left with small pockets of survivors,’ explains Alemi. ‘But in our attempt to model zombies somewhat realistically, it doesn't seem like this is how it would actually go down.’ ‘Given the dynamics of the disease, once the zombies invade more sparsely populated areas, the whole outbreak slows down—there are fewer humans to bite, so you start creating zombies at a slower rate,’ said Alemi. If the model was applied to the UK, the Scottish highlands might be the best equivalent to the Northern Rockies with a very low population density and similar terrain. 'In general the UK would be harder hit in my model than the US since it is a much smaller geographical area with larger population densities in general,' Alemi told MailOnline. 'All of the UK would fall on a timescale of months. The details of course depend on the particular choice of parameters, but we tried to set our parameters to match the behavior of zombies in the movies. Of course if you wanted it all to be over soon, you should plant yourself in downtown London,' he added. 'North western Scotland would likely be some of the last untouched places in the UK.' Nightmare: If the model was applied to the UK, the Scottish highlands might be the best analogue to the Northern Rockies with a low population density and similar terrain (scene from the Walking Dead pictured) Don’t fight: Zombies wouldn’t have the neural responses to care about pain, so unless you could shoot to kill, it would be best to run for it. Keep quiet: Zombies with CDHD would have very little memory and poor concentration, so if you hid, something else would likely capture their attention, keeping you safe. Distract them: Damage to zombies’ posterior parietal cortex would mean that they couldn’t concentrate and would be at the mercy of whatever grabs their attention. Try fireworks for a quick getaway. Copy to survive! Zombies wouldn’t be able to recognise faces so they identify each other by movements and sounds. ‘If confronted with a herd of the undead with no clear avenue of escape, do what Shaun and his friends did in “Shaun of the dead” – act like a zombie, the experts said . Out-run them: This only would only work with CDHD-1 zombies, who would only be able to lumber along clumsily. Don’t try reason: ‘CDHD presents with a massive dysfunction of the language circuits in the brain. This means that zombies can’t understand what you’re saying, nor can they talk back,’ the neuroscientists warn. Their ‘fight’ reaction would dominate, leaving you pleading with an angry hungry zombie. Mimic them: Zombies wouldn’t be able to recognise faces so they identify each other by movements and sounds. ‘If confronted with a herd of the undead with no clear avenue of escape, do what Shaun and his friends did in “Shaun of the dead” – act like a zombie. Do it with enough accuracy and you can wander through the herd undetected,’ Professors Verstynen and Voytek say. Using fictional diseases like a zombie outbreak can be a fun introduction to the complicated maths of disease modelling, according to Alemi. If given more time, Alemi said the team would add more complicated social dynamics, including air travel, evacuations and advance warnings, giving the humans a better chance to prepare. The group will present their findings at the 2015 American Physical Society March Meeting, on Thursday, March 5 in San Antonio, Texas. The simulation was inspired by the graphic novel World War Z - which the 2013 movie starring Brad Pitt was based on - during a graduate statistical mechanics class at Cornell University. In 2014 scientists analysed zombie behaviour in films, identifying two different types and the areas of the brain likely to be affected based on their characteristics. The CDHD-1 type is the traditional slow and dumb zombie, while the CDHD-2 is the fast and frantic type seen in 28 Days Later and World War Z . If you suppose that zombies are created by a supernatural version of mother nature, it appears she is very clever, because the specific brain changes mean that the consciousness and free will of zombies would be highjacked, but their brain functions needed to hunt, would be preserved. ‘Random brain damage does not result in brain damage,’ the authors say. ‘This means the infection spares the neural tissue that’s needed for spreading the infection,’ when one zombie bites or eats another human. ‘Areas necessary for anger, hunger, smelling, seeing, biting and other basic movements remain intact, while obliterating the areas that produce complex thoughts, make proactive decisions or consciously form and recall memories.’ Zombiism can be seen in the natural world: A fungus called Cordyceps takes over the minds of insects. It controls the mind of its host ant, before killing it and releasing spores through its body (pictured) While such behaviour is theoretical in humans, there are plenty of examples of zombiism in the animal kingdom. A fungus called Cordyceps takes over the minds of insects. It starts life as a spore that lands on an ant, which slowly stops performing its usual role in a colony, so it’s thrown out by more diligent worker ants. The fungus takes control of the ganglion cells that make up the insect’s brain, forcing it to bite down hard on a leaf with its mandibles. At this point, Cordyceps kills its host, causing a stalk to erupt through the ant’s head and release more zombie spores to secure the fungus’ grisly existence. Similarly, a tiny thorny-headed worm of the phylum Ancantho cephalia, burrows into the brain of a tiny crustacean, Gammarus lacustris, to take control of its nervous system. It forces the crab to swim towards the ocean’s surface where it will be attacked by predators. In humans, tapeworms can make its way into the brain to change our behaviour, but a microbe called Toxo plasma gondii (T.gondii) goes a step further. Found in cat faeces, it can infect humans and stop them fearing risky behaviour, with tragic results.","Cities would fall in days, according to model of spread of fictional disease .

"Acclaimed Australian political historian David Day has urged Malcolm Turnbull to show some guts and take on Tony Abbott. He challenges Turnbull to 'be more courageous, like Paul Keating' and covet the leadership of the party and country. Day has penned  his latest instalment on the country's 'most important Labor prime ministers', ""Paul Keating The Biography"", and told Daily Mail Australia that Turnbull should take a leaf out of Keating's book. Be like Paul. Political historian David Day has urged Malcolm Turnbull (left) to show some guts and take on Tony Abbott . He said he should 'be more courageous, like Paul Keating' and covet the leadership of his party . Malcolm Turnbull should look to history, says David Day, and take on Tony Abbott. 'Keating tried and failed but six months later it paid off' Paul Keating (left) is the subject of David Day's most recent political account. He lost his first party room ballot against Bob Hawke (right) but six months later would succeed . 'He (Keating) knew his first challenge (against Bob Hawke) was a big risk but he took it, he was a courageous politician on several fronts, and it showed then,' Day said. 'Turnbull should look to that sort of history, Keating tried and failed .. but six months later it paid off.' Indeed, Keating put his political career on the line when he challenged Bob Hawke in June of 1991. He was soundly defeated in the party room ballot and took his place on the backbench. Six months later though, it was a far different story. The man, who had left school at age 14, took over as PM just a week before Christmas, when he defeated Hawke in a second tilt. But while the former PM refused Day's invitation to play a part in his new book, Day is a fan. 'I take several legacies out of his time in Australian politics,' he said. 'He opened up Australia to the world, he had mostly impressive years as treasurer, put the republic on the agenda and Mabo was perhaps the most important policy on a practical level.' 'Yes he was a divisive figure but I admire many of the things he did.' Indeed, Day does not resile from his belief that Keating may have suffered dyslexia, a claim to which the former PM took no shortage of umbrage. He wrote a letter to the SMH on that score saying, in part: 'This is completely untrue.' Day says Paul Keating's speeches 'were memorable'. Here the former Australian Prime Minister is pictured in 1992 as he prepares to speak at Redfern in Sydney, to mark the International Year of the World's Indigenous People . Malcolm Turnbull has been urged to take on Tony Abbott by political historian David Day (right) The moment which led to then PM Paul Keating being labelled 'the Lizard of Oz' by the British media, as he places a hand on the back of Queen Elizabeth II during her tour of Australia in 1992. Day says it was a non-issue for most Australians . Keating also took him to task on his marital status. 'Day's book is full of inaccuracies, including that I divorced my wife - which I have not,' he wrote. The author told DMA: 'I will take his word on the divorce but on the question of dyslexia, I stand by it.' 'He obviously took it badly, in that perhaps it suggests you are a moron but that is not the case at all. 'Winston Churchill and Einstein both were (dyslexic) and the description of someone who is, fits him (Keating) to a tee. 'Just his behaviour, in the way he got his knowledge and how he got his information. For a long time nothing was known about it all but it's not a disability and it helps to explain how he operated, how he could see th ebig picture and how he was able to scane documents and get a gist faster than others.' Keating did not assist Day with the book and says there are several inaccuracies in the account. 'I tried several times to speak with him but he just said no, he did not want to be involved in the writing of it.' But that did not diminish his respect for the former Labor leader. 'Keating had been treasurer for nearly nine years, he transformed Australia's economy it's fair to say but he wanted the top job,' Day added. 'He truly wanted Australians to be proud of their country and wanted to lead those changes .. and he did so.' The former PM is pictured as he arrives for the funeral of former Labor Deputy Leader Tom Uren in Sydney earlier this month. He has refuted claims by writer David Day that he suffered dyslexia . Tony Abbott (seated) beat Malcolm Turnbull 42 votes to 41 to take over the Liberal Party leadership in 2009. David Day has urged the Communications Minister to show courage and challenge for the top job again . Even the hand on the Queen's back incident was a non-issue, according to the author. 'I don't think it meant anything to Australians, it was not a concern for them at all, if anything it just made him seem more human, it was just about the Fleet Street reaction, where they went over-the-top calling him ""the Lizard of Oz"" all that.' 'His was a formidable (political) career and his speeches were memorable,' Day said. 'This book was particularly gruelling for me, so that delayed the writing of it but I found that there are very different opinions about him.' 'Keating,' Day said, 'was always a reluctant convert to the ascendancy (as leader) of Bob Hawke. Day recounts how Keating made no secret of, and continues to, the belief he did much of the hard graft for the Hawke Government in the mid-eighties, after the then PM's daughter Rosslyn was 'found to be addicted to heroin'. 'It's a sign of their close relationship that Keating is the one minister in whom Hawke confides,' wrote Day, while noting, it also changed their relationship for the worse. 'Keating's speeches were memorable'. David Day, despite being challenged by the ex-PM over claims in the new book, remains a fan of someone he called 'a divisive figure' Prime Ministers of the time. Then British leader Sir John Major greets Paul Keating . 'According to Keating, the shock wrought on Hawke destroys his confidence to such an extent that he takes years to recover, leaving Keating to carry most of the burden of government,' according to Day. 'This leaves a power void, says Keating, ""and I filled it"". Not surprisingly this is roundly rejected by Hawke.' Day has now added Keating's account to his 'series of six most important PMs', along with the best-sellers on John Curtin, Andrew Fisher and Ben Chifley - with Bob Hawke and Gough Whitlam still to come to complete the set. On whether any of the current parliamentarians will ascend to the 'most important' list one day, the author singled out Mark Dreyfus and Anthony Albanese as having the potential to succeed, while adding: 'I thought Tony Abbott would do better than he has.' Potential to succeed. Author David Day says Shadow Transport Minister, Anthony Albanese (left) and Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus (right) have what it takes to get to the top . Paul Keating shares a joke with Prince Charles. The former PM once famously told the Queen that 'Australians felt the monarchy was an anachronism' Paul Keating, 71, became Australia's 24th Prime Minister, holding office for more than five years before he was toppled in the 1996 election by John Howard. He was treasurer for almost nine years and the floating of the Australian dollar remains one of the pivotal moments of that tenure. Keating would spend almost 27 years in federal politics and Day writes of that time: 'The cost of his single-minded ambition was eating away at his marriage and threatening the relationships that he held most dear.' 'Rather than being lauded for his efforts, Keating was tossed from office at the 1996 election by voters who had become tired of change. 'Spurned by his own part, and with his marriage in tatters, Keating was left lonely and embittered as he watched some of his milestone achievements being dismantled by the new (Howard) government.' David Day's account of Paul Keating's political life is the fourth in a series of six on Labor Prime Ministers .","Leading political historian David Day has challenged Malcolm Turnbull .

"The families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have begged for their lives to be spared in their first interview on Indonesian television as it emerged Tony Abbott called the Indonesian president to ask for clemency. The lengthy interview, which was recorded in English and shown on Metro TV on Wednesday night, was cut down to just 45 seconds as the families spoke of the men's rehabilitation and pleaded for clemency from President Joko Widodo. 'I don't want them to execute my son. He has done a lot of good things, he is a good person, he is a changed person,' Sukumaran's mother, Raji, said. 'I am begging the president not to execute him, to give him another chance, for him to stay in the prison and continue to do all the good things he is doing.' It comes as Toby Abbott called the Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday night and described the conversation over the fate of the two Australians on death row as positive. Scroll down for video . Raji Sukumaran and her children Chinthu (right) and Brintha (left) appeared on Indonesian television on Wednesday night to beg for Myuran Sukumaran's life to be spared from execution . Andrew Chan's brother Michael joined the Sukumaran family as the families spoke of the men's rehabilitation and pleaded for clemency from President Joko Widodo . 'Suffice it to say that the president absolutely understands our position,' Mr Abbott said. Ms Sukumaran was joined in the interview by her two children, Chinthu and Brintha, as well as Chan's brother Michael. 'We feel embarrassed because this happened. We, as a family, know that this has caused a lot of shame for Indonesians and we apologise,'  Michael Chan, wearing a traditional Indonesian batik shirt, said. 'But I think (in) 10 years he had done a lot of good things for Indonesians inside the prison system to try and ask for forgiveness.' The short excerpt was recorded in English and wasn't captioned, which would have made it difficult for many Indonesians to understand, Fairfax Media reports. The lengthy interview with Sukumaran and Chan's families, which was recorded in English and shown on Metro TV on Wednesday night, was cut down to just 45 seconds . Myuran Sukumaran's mother, Raji (pictured with his siblings Chinthu (left) and daughter Brintha (right) begged  to save her son's life as he awaits execution in Bali . The exclusive interview, which was their first for Indonesian television, was wrapped into a news bulletin on the impending executions. Using just 45 seconds of interview footage highlighted how Sukumaran and Chan's positive rehabilitation in jail may not be known to Indonesia's population. News bulletins are regularly filled with drug warnings  and details of Sukumaran and Chan's arrest for trying to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia is barely reported, according to Fairfax Media. Indonesia's attorney-general  said on Wednesday that 10 drug traffickers, including Chan and Sukumaran, were slated to be executed soon. No date has been set, but authorities said preparations were 90 percent ready. Sukumaran's parents, Raji and Sam, and his siblings Chinthu and Brintha, have been in Bali for the past month. They have been unable to sleep or eat properly as they continue to live on knife's edge, News Corp reports. Chan's parents, Helen and Ken, have also spent the past three weeks in Bali  but were forced to return to Australia due to poor health. His brother Michael remains in Bali with friends. Michael Chan and Chintu Sukumaran, brothers of the men on death row, have both remained in Bali as they continue to fight for clemency . The families of Bali Nine duo spoke out on national television in the hope President Joko Widodo would see . Lawyers for Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) will challenge the presidential decree that denied them clemency in a Jakarta court . Mr Abbott said of his conversation on Wednesday he thought President Widodo was carefully considering Indonesia's position. 'I don't think it would help the case of these two young Australians if I was to start ventilating in public the contents of the conversation,' he told reporters in Canberra on Thursday. The president previously rejected clemency for convicted drug runners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. It comes as lawyers for the Bali Nine duo lodged an appeal after they lost a bid to challenge Indonesia's presidential decree to spare the men from execution on Tuesday. Their lawyers  now have 14 days to lodge an appeal, according to one of their lawyers Peter Morrissey. '(Indonesia) have a court system, they have a rule of law and when you have the rule of law it stands to reason that you just don't execute the people who are litigating,' Mr Morrissey said. 'So what we think will happen is that the Indonesian executive will likely cooperate with the rule of law and act in accordance with it and not do anything drastic unless all legal impediments really are removed. And right now there is a live appeal on foot. Myuran Sukumaran's mother, Raji, begged on Indonesian television for the president to allow her son to live so he could continue doing the good work he's doing in prison . Raji Sukumaran and her daughter Brintha are living on knife's edge in Bali as they continue to visit Muyran in Kerobokan Prison . 'We are very hopeful about it, you know. We are not going to give up. Even if we had no hope we wouldn't give up. But we do have hope because the argument is a sensible good argument.' Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop revealed on Wednesday that Sukumaran's mother hugged her tightly and begged her to save her son from the firing squad. 'My last meeting with Mrs Sukumaran she hugged me so tightly I could hardly breathe,' Ms Bishop told Nine's Today show. 'No person could fail to be touched by the anguish of the families.' The Foreign Minister said while the pair's lawyers were lodging an appeal, she hoped Indonesia would see the 'value in these men's lives' as the federal government seeks a stay of execution. Ms Bishop said both men have been rehabilitated in the most remarkable way and were helping to rehabilitate other prisoners in Bali . 'We continue to appeal to President Joko Widodo's sense of generosity and his sense of forgiveness and hope that he will consider these clemency pleas and that there will be a stay of execution.' Ms Bishop said she wasn't understating the gravity of their drug crimes, but noted it was 10 years ago and they had made efforts to rehabilitate with Chan now a priest and Sukumaran being an accomplished artist. 'Both men have been rehabilitated in the most remarkable way. They are adding value to prison life in that they are working with other prisoners. 'They are rehabilitating other prisoners and helping Indonesia with this whole process of rehabilitating people, such as drug offenders.'","Families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were interviewed on Indonesia's Metro TV on Wednesday night .

"Giuliana Rancic has apologized for making 'racist' comments about 18-year-old singer Zendaya. The 40-year-old Fashion Police host delivered a contrite message in a live TV broadcast before a rerun of the controversial Oscars episode, which aired on Monday. In the Tuesday on air apology Rancic said she was sorry for claiming that the Disney star looked like she smelled of weed just because she has dreadlocks. 'I didn't mean to hurt anyone': Giuliana Rancic has apologized for making 'racist' comments about 18-year-old singer Zendaya . Offended: Zendaya, pictured at the Academy Awards on Sunday, lashed out at Giuliana Rancic on Monday following a 'disrespectful' comment about her hair . 'I'd really like to address something that's weighing really heavy on my heart,' the TV host began. 'I want to apologize for a comment that I made on last night's Fashion Police about Zendaya's hair.' 'As you know, Fashion Police is a show that pokes fun at celebrities in good spirit, but I do realize that something I said last night did cross the line.' 'I just want everyone to know that I didn't intend to hurt anybody, but I learned it's not my intent that matters,' Rancic continued. 'It's the result. And the result is people are offended, including Zendaya. And that is not okay.' 'Therefore, I want to say to Zendaya, and anyone else out there that I hurt, that I'm so sincerely sorry,' she concluded. 'This really has been a learning experience for me. I learned a lot today and this incident has taught me to be a lot more aware of cliches and stereotypes, and how much damage they can do.' 'And that I am responsible, as we all are, to not perpetuate them further. Thank you for listening.' Furor erupted online on Monday after Rancic claimed Zendaya smelled of patchouli just because she has dreadlocks. The comments went further on the Academy Awards special when the show cut to a picture of the singer on the red carpet - a voice off camera could be heard saying that the Disney star smelled like 'weed'. Many have claimed that the ignorant comment was not made by Rancic - who has been roundly slammed in the past 24 hours - but was in fact her co-host Kelly Osbourne.

'I DID NOT MAKE THE WEED COMENT (sic),' she wrote.  'I DO NOT CONDONE RACISM SO AS A RSULT OF THIS IM SEREIOULSY QUESTIONONIG STAYING ON THE SHOW!' Adding: 'I WILL NOT BE DRAGED INTO THIS! The situation is being rectified like ADULTS by both parties. I hope you can leave it to them & do the same!' 'you guys do realize that @Zendaya is my friend right?' 'Im giving everyone involved 24 hours to make it right or the world will hear how I really feel,' Kelly continued in another tweet. 'contactually Im not allowed to speak!' Meanwhile, following Rancic's offensive statements Zendaya hit back with a social media note of her own. Police brutality: The moment Fashion Police star Giuliana said Zendaya looks like she 'smelled of weed' because of her dreadlocks on Monday night's show . 'There is a fine line between what is funny and disrespectful,' she wrote. 'Someone said something about my hair at the Oscars that left me in awe. Not because I was relishing in rave outfit reviews, but because I was hit with ignorant slurs and pure disrespect. 'To say that an 18-year-old young woman with locs must smell of patchouli oil or 'weed' is not only a large stereotype but outrageously offensive. I don't usually feel the need to respond to negative things but certain remarks cannot go unchecked.' The Disney star then listed a number of personal luminaries who wear dreadlocks, and included her father, brother, best friend and little cousins. She claimed there was 'already harsh criticism of African American hair in society without the help of others who chose to judge people based on the curl of their hair.' She demanded Rancic 'contemplate a little before opening your mouth so quickly to judge'. 'My wearing my hair in locs on an Oscar red carpet was to showcase them in a positive light, to remind people of color that our hair is good enough. To me locs are a symbol of strength and beauty, almost like a lion's mane,' She added. Furious: The starlet said there was 'harsh criticism of African American hair in the society' Zendaya took to Instagram to share her thoughts . Zendaya's fans were quick to support her on Twitter, with some posting demands for apologies from E!, while other posted funny memes. However the 40-year-old tv personality apologized, for offending her, but refuted claims that what she had said was racist. 'Dear @Zendaya, I'm sorry I offended you and others,' she tweeted. 'I was referring to a bohemian chic look. Had NOTHING to do with race and NEVER would!!!' This is not the first time Fashion Police has come under fore for controversial remarks. Joan Rivers would frequently call out celebrities on the program, and often draw the ire of those in the entertainment industry. After the 203 Oscars, Rivers said of Heidi Klum's dress; 'The last time a German looked this hot was when they were pushing Jews into the ovens.' Rivers also attacked Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's daughter North West, saying; 'That baby is ugly ... I've never seen a 6-month-old so desperately in need of a waxing.' Many women were upset when she complimented a look worn by teenager AnnaSophia Robb by saying; 'This outfit is so young and fresh and sexy. It just screams ""date rape.""' Rancic meanwhile has been a staple on E! for years now, and the host of E! News since 2005, back when she was Guiliana DePandi. She has been a panelist on Fashion Police since it premiered in 2010. In 2011 she revealed she had breast cancer, and would later undergo a double mastectomy. She also stared on the reality show Guiliana and Bill with husband Bill Rancic for six seasons, in which cameras followed her as she attempted to get pregnant. The couple welcomed a son Edward in 2012 via gestational carrier. Zendaya wasn't the only entity Giuliana had a go at - she also flipped the bird at the entire Academy for leaving Fashion Police Commissioner Joan Rivers out of the In Memoriam segment during Sunday's Oscars. 'Screw them anyway for leaving Joan out of the In Memoriam segment,' She said brandishing both middle fingers. 'So f**k you, Oscar.' Rancic's sudden outburst came without warning as she was criticizing the Academy for the white photo backdrop it provided, which prevented Lupita Nyong'o's white gown from 'popping'. 'Let's all blame them. Let's blame them for everything,' she shouted. Her fashion police co-hosts Kelly Osbourne, Brad Goreski - and the audience - cheered in agreement, while Kathy Griffin added it was a 'miss' for the Academy. 'She was in feature films and I thought that was an odd miss,' she added. 'It's almost like even posthumously, she's still a rebel.'","Giuliana Rancic apologized on air Tuesday for comments she made about actress and singer Zendaya on the Oscars edition of Fashion Police .

"The judge presiding over the trial of Brazilian tycoon Eike Batista has been spotted driving his Porsche that was confiscated by the court. Flavio Roberto de Souza, who is overseeing Batista's trial for insider trading, was seen driving the white Porsche Cayenne by reporters for Estado de S.Paulo's news agency after a tip-off from Batista's lawyer. The luxury car de Souza was seen using on Tuesday, was part of a fleet belonging to the fallen tycoon that had been seized by police. Safe keeping: Judge Flavio Roberto de Souza was spotted driving a Porsche Cayenne (like right) confiscated from Brazilian tycoon Eike Batista as part of insider trading case . Local media said investigators had took the cars because of concerns Batista had been selling or donating assets that were frozen as part of the insider trading case. When asked why he was driving the Porsche, Souza told local business daily Valor Economico, it was for safe keeping. He said: 'The Federal Police did not have a safe place for the car and it was exposed to sun, rain and possible damage. As I want the car to be preserved in good condition, I took it to a covered parking space in the building where I live.' 'I did not take it to use, just to look after it... It is a normal situation,' he said. The cars were meant to be put up for auction this Thursday, but Batista's lawyer secured an injunction halting the sale. On trial: Eike Batista, once Brazil's richest man, is standing trial for insider trading. A Porsche Cayenne, later seen being driven by judge Flavio Roberto de Souza, was confiscated by the courts as part of proceedings . Batista lost almost everything as his EBX conglomerate fell apart and his flagship oil firm OGX filed for Latin America's largest bankruptcy in 2013. The business magnate, whose rise and fall have mirrored Brazil's own fortunes, recently resigned as chairman of Oleo E Gas Participações SA, as OGX is now known. Prosecutors accuse Batista of selling 236 million reais ($85 million) of OGX stock based on privileged information that its offshore oil fields would miss production forecasts. Batista denies selling the stock based on insider information, and says he was legally obliged to sell it to pay off debt. The Porsche incident is likely to give further ammunition to Batista's lawyer, Sergio Bermudes, who has been trying to get judge Souza taken off the case. Bermudes has argued that Souza has a bias against Batista, pointing to comments the judge made on the first day of trial in November. Souza told reporters at the time that Batista's career had been a 'megalomaniac dream.'","Porsche was seized from Brazilian business magnate Eike Batista .

"My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson has been at the centre of controversy this week, after claims from his ex-wife that  he's a 'deadbeat dad' who doesn't see or support his kids. Cindy Anderson told A Current Affair on Monday that the reality show contestant owed close to $40,000 in child support for their five children. Now it seems the wannabe chef may be forced to dish out the dosh from his estimated $1,000 a week MKR salary, along with a portion of any winnings, should he and new wife Carol Molloy take away the $250,000 first place prize. Scroll down for video . Dishing out the dosh? My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson could be made to pay a portion of his estimated $1,000 a week reality TV show wages and any prize money towards child support owing to his kids . Maria Monastiriotis, the head of Slater and Gordon's family law department in Sydney told Fairfax Media on Wednesday that any income received from the show that is taxable will be assessable in terms of his child support. 'Indeed, if there are any arrears in child support, that money can be earmarked towards those arrears,' Maria told the publication. 'The Department of Human Services also has the power to request that Channel Seven [or the producers] pay that money directly to them by something called a ""garnishee order"",' she added. Cindy claims she had sent producers a letter in January for that purpose, however Channel Seven say they never received her letter. 'Deadbeat dad'? My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson's ex-wife claimed he owes close to $40,000 in child support for their children, saying he's 'pretty much wiped his hands' of them . Another income? Family law expert Maria Monastiriotis told Fairfax Media on Wednesday that Adam's appearance and any winnings on the show could be taxable and therefore could be garnished to pay arrears . Channel Seven also refused to confirm or deny the estimated $1,000 weekly salary given to contestants, which was revealed by a former MKR contestant to Fairfax Media. 'We don't comment on our contest agreements,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. The former reality TV personality is understood to have told the publication, that in the past some contestants have avoided paying tax on their MKR earnings by claiming their time on the show was a ""hobby"", as opposed to a job. It's also unclear if the quarter of a million dollars prize money is taxable. However, Maria says regardless of taxable income, Cindy has the right to make a 'change of assessment' application to the child support agency if Adam's financial circumstances change significantly, such as winning the prize money. In the explosive interview, Cindy also claimed that her ex is friends with one of the show's judges, Pete Evans - coaching him on the court as well as working at Pete's Kings Cross restaurant Hugo's, in Sydney, after the couple's separation. Owing child support: Cindy Anderson made the explosive claims on A Current Affair on Monday night . Adam's former wife of almost 20 years, told A Current Affair on Monday night that she was speaking out on the show instead of dealing with the matter privately because, 'He has blocked my number and both his childrens' numbers - the older two girls have phones'. Adam's ex said she feels no bitterness that he has moved on and re-married Carol Molloy - his partner on the Channel 7 reality show - but she claims that's when her issues with child support payments began. A Channel Seven spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia in response to Cindy's claims: 'This is a private matter between the parties involved.' Channel Seven also refuted the assertion, that Adam and Pete are friends: 'They [Adam and Pete] met for the first time on the program'. Happier times: The couple were married for almost 20 years and had five children together . Ranging in age: Their kids are aged between eight years and 15 years of age . 'He has known Pete Evans, he knows him through tennis, through coaching him,' Cindy told reporter Brady Halls. 'We get no financial support at all,' she also told Brady. Cindy claims her concern is  that the large sum owning to her has amassed over the past year, which she says 'worries me considerably in that my youngest is only 8 - he has many more years where he needs support from his father.' 'The children also have no emotional support from him. He does not ring them, nor come and see them,' she said, adding 'they do not receive a card [for birthdays] in the mail, not even a phone call.' 'He's never played an active, massive role in their lives anyway...but basically his role now is non-existent, he's pretty much wiped his hands clean of the children,' Cindy said. Upset: The blonde single mother says she went on the show for the tell all after Adam's allegedly blocked her calls and the numbers of their two eldest daughters . The blonde single mother also claimed that the lack of funds has reached a point where it's 'significantly impacting on the children'. Cindy not only took aim at Adam during the interview but also at the Child Support Agency and producers of My Kitchen Rules. 'It seems there is little they [child support agency] can do, irrespective of him being in the print that he's working at three private schools doing tennis, irrespective of his face being on My Kitchen Rules. 'They consistently say there is no source of collection, there is no avenue for us to collect revenue,' she said. Friends in high place? Adam's ex-wife also claims the former tennis pro used to coach judge Pete Evans, a claim Channel Seven refute . Spokesman and General Manager for the Department of Human services, who over-sees the Child Support Agency, Hank Jongen told Brady: 'I can't talk about individual cases but let me assure you, that we go to great lengths in order to enforce child support obligations.' 'We will do whatever it takes to recover that money,' he added. Following the explosive A Current Affair interview, TV WEEK published quotes from the former tennis professional discussing his difficult divorce, saying the situation 'is not ideal'. 'Obviously I'd like to spend more time with them,' he told the magazine. However, Channel Seven claim the TV WEEK interview was done prior to Adam's ex-wife's interview earlier this week and the article has since been taken off their website. At the time the former tennis pro had said: 'Any split from a former wife is going to be tough and yeah it is tough,' he said, adding: 'Things end because both parties are unhappy.' 'If everything was great we’d still be together,' he said.","My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson is alleged to owe tens of thousands in child support for his five children .

"The Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia has launched a campaign to bring 25 of their fellow soldiers killed in action home to Australian soil. With the majority of them buried in Malaysia, and just one soldier laid to rest in Singapore, Vietnam veterans say their mates deserve a proper war grave in the country they died for. Among those buried is Reginald Hillier, and his nephew Neil Bond said his family have been trying to get his uncle home for almost 50 years. 'My mother she pushed tirelessly... She never gave up and she never stopped grieving,' Mr Bond told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . For many years Neil Bond (left) and Bob Shewring (right) have been campaigning to bring 25 Australian soldiers killed in the Vietnam War home . Reginald Hollier is one of 24 men buried at the Terendak General Christian Cemetery on Terendak Military Base in Malaysia . 'Reg' as his family call him, was Neil's mother's younger brother, who she was extremely close to. Never having him at home meant she never had closure, and could not grieve properly. 'It's tragic enough that he was killed … but the real wrong is that they only bought him partway home,' Mr Bond added. Bob Shewring, a Vietnam veteran himself, also knew Reg, and got involved in the 'battle' as he calls it, to get these men home many years ago. 'For a lot of the people, and I'm a Vietnam veteran, a lot of the people I talk to didn't even know they weren't bought home', Mr Shewring told Daily Mail Australia, speaking of the 25 men who were left behind. 'For me personally, because I'm very passionate about bringing them home, it would just bring closure to that sorry saga of a thing called the Veitnam war,' he added. '(It would) give those next of kins, relatives, descendants and the whole Vietnam veteran community closure.' The reason many of the men were not brought back to Australia was simply because their parents couldn't afford it. It would have cost them £500, which was half of the average yearly wage in 1965. This is the grave of Reg - as his family and friends call him - which Mr Bond and Mr Shewring recently visited . Reg was killed in action in 1965, but his next of kin, his sister, could not afford the £500 to bring him back . Recently, Mr Bond and Mr Shewring went to Malaysia to visit the Terendak General Christian Cemetery on Terendak Military Base where 24 of the Australians are buried. 'You have to apply to the high commission of Australia to get permission to visit it,' Mr Shewring explained. 'Then from the high commission of Malaysia and they have to apply to the army.' He said the whole process was long and drawn out, and took more than eight weeks to complete. Even then they were only allowed to visit for two hours, instead of the four hours they had requested. 'It was more powerful than I expected it to be,' Mr Bond said of the experience. Mr Shewring also said the visit to the cemetery was a highly emotional one, but helped to motivate him further. 'It really gets up my nose when other people say they're with their mates,' Mr Shewring said. 'When you talk about being buried with your mates, the graves are separated by religious denomination. 'Having been there and viewed these graves I can tell you they're not with their mates,' he continued. Thomas Simpson (left) and John Garrigan (right) are among those buried in Malaysia . Christopher Clark (left) and Ronald Lees (right) are also listed in the 25 soldiers to be bought home . After campaigning tirelessly for many years, the men, along with the the families of many of the other soldiers, hope they can bring the fallen home before the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam war next year.

With the help people signing their petition, and donating towards the $1 million it will cost to have the soldiers repatriated this could become a reality soon. When told about the plight of these soldiers 'left behind', the Federal Minister for Veteran Affairs Senator Michael Ronaldson said: 'I am very, very sympathetic to this'. 'If we can make it work we should be able to facilitate the return for those who believe it's now appropriate to do so', he told A Current Affair. Mr Bond said the return of his uncle Reg would mean the end to a difficult chapter in his family's history. The tragedy tore his mother apart, and was so important to her that Mr Bond's niece promised to carry on the campaign after her Nanna passed away. 'It's a huge part of our lives', he said. Mr Shewring said the fallen soldiers deserved to be laid to rest in a war grave, out of respect for their service to the nation. 'We have to rember that these people are not in a war, grave they're in a Chrsitian cemetary that happens to be in a military base,' he said. 'For me personally, because I'm very passionate about bringing them home, it would just bring closure to that sorry saga of a thing called the Vietnam War. 'I would like to work closely with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Government on Operation 'Bring Them Home', in bringing this to fruition in a timely manner. 'It is the right an honourable thing to do, they shouldn't be left in a foreign cemetery,' Mr Shewring added. When asked what it would mean for him if his uncle could finally be laid to rest on home soil, Mr Bond said it would mean the world. 'It's going to be hard to believe, for us it has been a 50 year battle', . 'Hopefully it will happen, if nothing else it just airs this wrong. People need to know. 'It should have been put to bed and grieved for 50 years ago.'

"Elephants in the South African bush are being trained to use their super-strength sense of smell to sniff out explosives and poachers. The project, supported by the U.S. Army Research Office, was inspired after elephants in Angola were observed using their trunks to help them avoid areas full of land mines left over from decades of civil war. Sean Hensman, operator of Adventures with Elephants game ranch in South Africa, said: 'An elephant's nose is amazing. Think about mammoths, which had to find food through the ice.' Elephants in the South African bush are being trained to use their super-strength sense of smell to sniff out explosives and poachers . During  tests, a 17-year-old male elephant named Chishuru was  walked past a row of buckets- once of which would have a swab laced with TNT scent stapled to the bottom of one. Sticking his trunk into each bucket, he was taught to stop and raise a front leg when he came across the one with the swab. He got the bucket right each time. And like a sniffer dog, he was rewarded with his favourite treat: the marula fruit. U.S. army researchers, who have been involved in the project for five years, say there will be no elephants on the field but robotic drones could collect material for them to test.

'We could bring scents from the field collected by unmanned robotic systems to the elephants for evaluation,' added Stephen Lee, chief scientist of the U.S. Army Research Office. Despite their super-strength senses of smell, the jury is still out on who has the better nose: dogs or elephants. But Mr Lee did say there was some truth in the old adage that an elephant never forgets. 'Dogs require constant training while the elephants seem to understand and remember the scent without the need for constant training,' he said. Mr Hensman had previously trained a dozen elephants for anti-poaching patrols in Zimbabwe. After his family lost their three farms to President Robert Mugabe's land seizures in 2002, he moved to South Africa to continue his work.","Elephants in South Africa are being taught to sniff out explosives in project .

"Keith Olbermann has been suspended from presenting his television sports show on ESPN for a week over comments he made to students on Twitter when they contacted him about their cancer fundraiser. Olbermann, who is well known for his forthright posts on Twitter and critical view of Penn State, was contacted by a student at the university about their annual pediatric cancer fundraiser, but responded with just one word 'Pitiful.' In an exchange of furious tweets with students who had been involved in the $13million fundraising effort, Olbermann repeatedly refused to back down and posted a number of critical comments about the school's reputation and branded students stupid. Keith Olbermann has been suspended from presenting his show on ESPN for a week after he got into a Twitter spat with students about a cancer fundraiser for children they had done, as he criticised the university . He later apologised that his comments had come in response to the pediatric cancer fundraiser and was suspended by ESPN. Olbermann had insisted his comments were about the university in general and not the campaign. In a statement the sports channel said: 'We are aware of the exchange Keith Olbermann had on Twitter last night regarding Penn State. 'It was completely inappropriate and does not reflect the views of ESPN. 'We have discussed it with Keith, who recognizes he was wrong. ESPN and Keith have agreed that he will not host his show for the remainder of this week and will return on Monday.' The spat began when a student posted a message on Twitter to Olbermann with the phrase 'We Are!' on Monday evening and a link to a story about the fundraising campaign, which takes place every year at the University. Olbermann replied with 'Pitiful', and his response inflamed students and alumni who saw the exchange. The twitter exchange began when a student at Penn State sent Keith Olbermann a link to a story about their $13million fundraising campaign to help children with cancer, and he replied with one word: 'Pitiful' The initial message referred to an annual fundraising campaign called Thon, run by Penn State. It is a three day dance marathon which has been raising money for the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital since 1977. Olbermann was highly critical of the university in numerous exchanges, saying his comment was aimed at defining Penn State itself and was referring to students who go there in general. The host has previously been critical of the institution after its assistant football coach was convicted of sex abuse. In one post he said: 'I'd like to thank the students and alums of Penn State for proving my point about the mediocrity of their education and ethics.' A number of people saw Olbermann's tweet and criticised the presenter for his comments about Penn State . At the end of the exchange Olbermann posted further comments outlining his dislike for the university . And in another message, when a student asked if he had an opinion about the millions of dollars they had managed to raise, Olbermann replied that it still did not change the school's reputation. But later on Tuesday evening Olbermann apologised on Twitter. He said: 'I was stupid and childish and way less mature than the students there who did such a great fundraising job.' Olbermann had previously worked as a news commentator for MSNBC, and was known for his reporting of the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky scandal. He gained infamy when he interviewed Hilary Clinton at the same time he was working on reporting the affair, and later apologised for his actions. He was fired from MSNBC in 2011 for donating money congressional Democrats who had been guests on his show. Olbermann repeatedly refused to back down over the comments he posted about Penn State university . Olbermann returned to ESPN in 2013 after a 13 year absence, but was forbidden from talking about politics on the show. The ESPN host has taken a swipe at Penn State before, placing it in a list of the 'World's Worst in Sports' during an episode of Olbermann in January, Sports Illustrated reported. This followed a decision by by NCAA to restore former Nittany Lions coach Joe Paterno's victories, which had previously been vacated as part of the school's sanctions after the Jerry Sandusky scandal. At the time the school was forced to vacate all its victories from 1998 to 2011 after Sandusky, a longtime Penn State assistant football coach was convicted on 45 counts of sex abuse.​ .","Penn State students contacted presenter Keith Olbermann about campaign .

"Control over £6billion in health spending could be handed to  Manchester in a national first. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to announce the radical plan, which will see all NHS funding devolved from Westminster to the region, later this week. It is part of the creation of a powerful new body covering the whole of Greater Manchester, but critics warn that a time of intense pressure on NHS budgets it could be a 'poisoned chalice' for the region.' Hospitals across Greater Manchester, including Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport, could be funded locally under radical plans to devolve health spending . Under the deal, full control health spending - worth £6billion-a-year - will be devolved to Greater Manchester. A leaked draft memorandum of understanding includes the creation of a new board to distribute funding and take decisions in areas such as personnel, regulation, information-sharing and NHS buildings. It would work closely with existing clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) of GPs. In a surprise move the transfer of NHS funding to 10 local councils would happen very quickly, taking effect from April next year. Chancellor George Osborne said today: 'We're discussing a plan for bringing together the NHS and social care in Manchester so we provide better care for patients. 'This is exactly what we want to see more of in our health care. It's also about giving Greater Manchester more control over things run in Greater Manchester - which is what our vision of a northern powerhouse is all about. 'It's early days, but I think it's a really exciting development. We'll be working hard now with Greater Manchester and NHS England on getting the details right so the arrangements work best for patients.' The region has already accepted the creation of a powerful 'metro mayor' in return for taking over responsibility for transport, skills and housebuilding and the right to recoup some money generated by growth. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) eventually hopes for full devolution of all £22billion of public spending in the city. But any move to combine health budgets - currently held by NHS England - with councils' existing social care duties had been thought to be some way down the line. However, devolving health spending to local areas could risk creating 'postcode lotteries' with differing levels of care and clinical priorities. NHS England's chief executive Simon Stevens said: 'NHS England is working on this ground-breaking offer to the local NHS in Greater Manchester, working in partnership with elected local authorities. 'The NHS five-year forward view says we want to back local leaders and communities who come together to improve health care of their residents and patients. While this new model won't necessarily be right for many other parts of England, for Greater Manchester the time is right and conditions are right for shared success.' In a speech in Manchester last month, George Osborne promised to hand control over spending and growth to the north west . Richard Humphries, assistant director of the King's Fund think tank, said that a full transfer of responsibility would be a reform 'on a breathtaking scale' but could pose serious risks. He warned that taking money away from CCGs and NHS England to give it to councils was on 'the nuclear end of the spectrum and raises all sorts of questions and risks'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Depending on the detail - and the detail is really crucial and we don't have that yet - you could either see this as a triumph for local democracy or creating real risks of yet another reorganisation of the NHS when it's barely recovered from the last one.' With the NHS 'heading for the financial rocks', there were also concerns about accountability and financial risk with the NHS, he said. 'If the plan is to give the money to local government, the words 'chalice' and 'poisoned' perhaps spring to mind.' The post of police and crime commissioner for Greater Manchester Police - established by the coalition Government - will also be scrapped in favour of the new mayor. Mr Osborne has hailed extended powers for cities as a key part of efforts to create a 'northern powerhouse' to rival London economically.","George Osborne expected to announce radical plan later this week .

Taken by legendary photographer Todd Webb in 1946, the collection of black and white images show the bustling docks of Manhattan, the skyline prior to its ever-rising glass-walled skyscrapers - and the people who called the city home. Webb was about 40 years old when he set out on foot around the city with his camera, having just returned from a posting as a Naval Photographer in the Second World War. Daily Mail online sent out photographer Edwin Torres to replicate present day photos of Todd Webb - and revealed where the Big Apple has undergone incredible transformation in the past 70 years - and where it has stayed, magically, unchanged.

As well as the iconic sights and architecture of the metropolis, Webb's images also took in locals around his Harlem neighborhood, and working folk in downtown Manhattan around Chinatown and the Battery Park. The images have been dusted off from the archives and published in a limited-edition collection,21st Editions. According to photography experts, Webb, who won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1955, was notable in getting to know the subjects of his portraits before shooting - sometimes spending days talking to people before taking a picture. In an introduction to the images, Harvard professor John Stauffer wrote how Webb was also an unusual photographer for his time, taking an interest in picturing African-Americans and interracial friendships. Although 1946 was blighted by the death of his mentor, photographer and modern art promoter Alfred Stieglitz, Webb - who died in 2000 - remembered it as one of best and most productive years.

Although the store name in the 1946 picture is not visible, the 2015 shot reveals that Streit's has supposedly been open since 1925.

"The carcasses of 11 kangaroos have been found in a bin northeast of Melbourne in the past week, with police concerned by the spate of 'gruesome' killings. Victoria Police were called to a carwash on Warrandyte-Heidelberg Rd in Warrandyte after a staff member made the shocking discovery on Tuesday afternoon. Another six dead kangaroos were found in the same bin last week, along with a 45cm arrow, according to police. The carcasses of 11 kangaroos, including three joeys (pictured: bottom left) have been found stuffed into bins at a carwash in Melbourne.  (Supplied: George Vattakuzhy) 'It's a bit gruesome,' a Victoria Police spokesman said. 'There could be a valid reason why they are there, but we need to find out what is happening.' George Vattakuzhy made both shocking discoveries, and said it was so 'disgusting' he could not work from his nearby office. 'I empty the bins everyday, so when I opened them I saw the baby kangaroos,' Mr Vattakuzhy said. 'The second time, I found three joeys stuffed into the smaller bins. I went to empty those into the dumpster and found the larger kangaroos. Victoria Police Sergeant Stewart Henderson said the series of killings is 'quite sickening'. 'It was absolutely filthy, the smell was very bad.' Sergeant Stewart Henderson earlier said the deaths may be the work of a bow hunter or bow hunters. 'We are looking at a number in incidents around the area in which animals have been injured or killed by bow hunters,' he said. 'These cases are not only a danger to wildlife but also have the possibility to put the public in danger if hunting is involved. 'To see someone attacking these defenceless animals really is quite sickening.' Police are investigating if the spate of deaths is linked to a recent incident where an arrow was found in a live kangaroo in Templestowe.","Police called to carwash in Melbourne's northeast on Tuesday afternoon .

"The soaring number of female doctors working part-time in surgeries is contributing to a crisis in GP recruitment, an official government study has revealed. The Migration Advisory Committee said the 'feminisation of the GP workforce' meant more trainees were needed to maintain the same service for patients - because women are more likely to work shorter hours than men after they have children. This has contributed to  an annual shortage of 450 to 550 GPs, the committee warned. In its report published this morning, the committee said more needed to be done to recruit family doctors – including hiring extra foreign doctors from across the EU. The Migration Advisory Committee said the 'feminisation of the GP workforce' meant more trainees were needed to maintain the same service for patients . The report said: 'It seemed that the health service could do more to source recruits from within the EU not withstanding what was said about problems with language and competency requirements.' It said there are only around 20 GPs recruited each year from elsewhere in the EU – blaming the requirement to meet language and strict NHS standards. But the committee also said more could be done to make becoming a GP more attractive to medical students. It said: 'We did not see any evidence suggesting that there is a shortage of medical students who could continue into general practice. 'Therefore, any shortage of GPs could potentially be overcome by changing the incentive structure of GPs compared with other medical roles, in order to encourage more take-up on GP training programmes.' NHS England recommends that there are 70 GPs per 100,000 population, but the UK is currently below this - at around 64 per 100,000 - and has been for some time. Jeremy Hunt is struggling to fill an annual shortage of 450 to 550 GPs and has been encouraged to do more to hire doctors from abroad . Overall there are around 60,000 licensed doctors on the GP register. The committee said it had considered adding GPs to the so-called shortage occupation list after a request by the Department of Health to allow the NHS to recruit doctors from outside the EU. But it said there are enough medical students in the UK and Europe to fill the need. The committee also rejected claims that there is a shortage of nurses that can be fixed by further recruitment from overseas. But the committee has, for the first time, recommended that paramedics can be recruited through Britain's points-based skilled migration system after it found no other options to ease pressure on the existing workforce across the country.","Migration Advisory Committee warns of 'feminisation of the GP workforce'

"The driver of a bin lorry which crashed killing six people in Glasgow last year will not face charges, authorities have announced. Harry Clarke, 58, collapsed at the wheel of the council refuse truck three days before Christmas, causing it to veer onto the pavement before crashing into a hotel. Neither he nor the vehicle's owner, Glasgow City Council, will face charges after prosecutors in Scotland studied a police report into the tragedy, it emerged today. Scroll down for video . The refuse truck crashed in Glasgow city centre in December after mounting the pavement and killing six . In a statement, Scotland's Crown Office said today: 'The Police report has now been carefully considered by Crown Counsel - the most senior lawyers within the Crown Office. 'Crown Counsel have concluded that the driver of the lorry should not be prosecuted in respect of this tragic incident. 'Despite its catastrophic consequences there is no evidence to suggest that the driver's conduct at the time amounted to a breach of the criminal law. 'There is no evidence to support a prosecution of Glasgow City Council in respect of any Health and Safety concerns breaches in Health and Safety law.' Investigators have refused to speculate on claims Mr Clarke suffered a heart attack at the wheel. John 'Jack' Sweeney, 68, his wife Lorraine, 69, and their 18-year-old granddaughter Erin McQuade were all shopping when struck and killed by the truck. Primary school teacher Stephenie Tait, 29, tax worker Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh also died in the crash. Lorraine Sweeney (left) and her granddaughter Erin McQuade (right) were among the six people killed . Miss McQuade's grandfather Jack Sweeney (left) and wedding planner Gillian Ewing (right) also died . Tax office worker Jacqueline Morton (left) and teacher Stephenie Tait (right) were also among the victims . Mr Clarke has previously said he thinks about each victim 'every minute of every day'. Crown lawyers decided that a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) should be held 'to ensure that there can be a full public hearing of the facts of the case'. They will petition the courts within two weeks for the inquiry to be held as soon as possible. A Crown Office spokesman said: 'A Fatal Accident inquiry is held into cases where a death or deaths were sudden, suspicious, or unexplained or occurred in circumstances such as to give rise to serious public concern.' Relatives of those who died in the incident have been informed of the decision not to bring a prosecution and to hold an FAI  'to determine the cause of the crash and establish what lessons can be learned from this tragic incident'. Mr Clarke has said he cannot 'remember anything at all' about the crash and was completely unaware he had heart problems until after the incident. He told the Daily Record: 'I understand a lot of people want to know what happened that day. I wish I could tell you but I can't. I just want all of the families of the injured and deceased to know I can't remember anything. 'Nothing will ever be normal for the families or me ever again. Every day is a struggle.' Ambulances at the scene of the crash on December 22. A inquiry will examine the causes of the crash . The accident - just days before Christmas - led to an outpouring of grief among shocked Glaswegians . Two refuse workers in the back of the bin lorry's cab attempted to rouse him but were prevented from stopping the truck by a safety rail in the vehicle. Mr Clarke tested negative for drink-driving. Patrick McGuire, a partner with Thompsons Solicitors, which is representing some of those affected by the crash, said: 'This announcement from the Crown Office is very welcome. 'It begins the process of finding out what happened to cause this terrible accident, which is of the greatest importance to the victims and their relatives. 'My clients and I are particularly heartened that the Crown has moved so quickly towards convening an FAI. It has often been the case that years can pass before an FAI is set up, if indeed one is set up at all. This leads to further anguish to victims and their families. 'Therefore the Crown Office is to be commended for its swift action, which reflects the huge public concern about this accident.' A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: 'We will provide any assistance that the inquiry needs.'","Refuse truck driver collapsed at wheel and lorry ran out of control .

"British soldiers killed in a 'friendly fire' incident in Afghanistan when they were hit by an anti-tank missile had repeatedly requested the rocket to be fired, an inquest has heard. A senior Danish officer, who was in command of the operation in which Captain Tom Sawyer, 26, and Corporal Danny Winter, 28, were killed, insisted British troops had 'pushed' for the Javelin missile to be deployed. The attack on the evening of January 14, 2009, had been ordered by the British troops' Danish counterparts during a joint operation against the Taliban. Capt Sawyer, of the Royal Artillery, and Cpl Winter, of 45 Commando Royal Marines, were among a group of British soldiers on a rooftop providing fire support for an operation clearing insurgent compounds north east of Gereshk in central Helmand. Captain Tom Sawyer, (left) of the Royal Artillery, and Corporal Danny Winter, of the Royal Marines, were killed in southern Afghanistan in the friendly fire incident . Two other members of the Zulu Company were injured in the explosion, which happened around 800 metres from Forward Operating Base Gibraltar. Investigations into the incident have shown that the missile was fired by British personnel but the order was given by a lieutenant in the Danish Army only referred to as Soldier A. The Danish soldiers have declined to attend the inquest and their evidence would be given in witness statements. The Danish officer commanding the operation, known as Soldier B, explained his soldiers, including a British Javelin missile team with night sight equipment, were on the roof of a compound. Soldier B insisted that the Javelin missile operators had positively identified enemy insurgents crawling into position on the roof of a building and they spent up to one hour trying to locate Zulu Company. 'Soldier A and I interpreted this as the enemy was about to take up position closer to Zulu,' Soldier B said in a written statement read to the court. 'Over the network I asked Zulu Company to confirm they were inside the compound. I did not know the exact words used as it was signalman who was conducting the conversation. A British soldier undertaking a training exercise fires a Javelin missile similar to that which killed two British soldiers in friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2009. File image used . British troops faced a number of fierce battles in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. File image used . 'I found out from the signalman that Zulu Company was static which is why it could not be them that was moving. He added that Zulu Company then asked repeatedly for his team to use the Javelin as they could see light about 100 metres from their position, which is why they were convinced they were soon to be attacked. 'Javelin again asked for permission to fire as it looked as if the enemy were in the position of extricating themselves from the position. 'Soldier A was still in doubt, which is why he again ordered the observer to fire with his rifle using live tracers.' After this Soldier A ordered the Javelin marksman to fire off a shot towards the target. He added: 'Immediately afterwards the Rifleman fired a rocket and reported he had hit the target but the target was still moving about, which is why he requested permission to fire again. 'Soldier A wanted a positive confirmation from Zulu Company that the enemy had been hit before firing again, so he refused to let them fire.'","British soldiers killed by friendly fire attack had requested the rocket strike .

Her father Bob Richardson said he saw his daughter trying desperately to breathe but she kept being dragged into a whirlpool. Mr Richardson jumped in and tried to save Mrs Lannen but he also started getting sucked down into the whirlpool and he couldn't drag her out, so he was forced to let her go. Another man jumped in and dragged Mrs Lannen out of the water, where witnesses carried out CPR for 40 minutes until emergency services arrived. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Her mother Margaret Richardson, who was also at the picnic, said Mrs Lannen had suffered from pneumonia in the past and did not have a strong chest or lungs.

"Walking free: Asif Masood, 40, ploughed a Ford Focus into a fire hydrant in Nottingham following a drinking binge but avoided jail after a court heard he had re-found Islam . An unlicensed drink-driver who was three times over the limit when he crashed a friend's car has walked free after a court heard he had re-found Islam and was living a more pious life. Asif Masood, 40, ploughed a Ford Focus into a fire hydrant in Nottingham after driving over a roundabout following a drinking binge on November 17 last year. The car’s wheel had come off, while tyre tracks and debris criss-crossed the road, magistrates heard. When police arrived he was found swaying near his wrecked vehicle and told officers: 'I've crashed my car, I've had lots and lots to drink and I don't have a driving licence.' He was breathalysed and produced  a reading of 98 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35. But Masood, who has nine previous convictions for 14 offences, walked free from court after magistrates heard he had re-found his faith and was now teetotal after quitting drink and drugs . His solicitor added that the incident happened when Masood had been suffering 'considerable stress related to harassment and threats'. As a result chairman of the bench Martin Rudge sentenced Masood to a 25-month driving ban and fined him £350 with £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. Magistrates do have the power to impose sentences of up to six months in prison. Mr Rudge said: 'We have taken into account your guilty plea and the fact you made no attempts to escape from the incident.' Prosecutor Sanjay Jerath told the court: 'At 1am police officers attended a road traffic collision and the defendant was stood near a Ford Focus and there was extensive damage to the vehicle. 'Tyre tracks could be seen across the island heading from the direction of Broxtowe Lane towards the location of the car. 'A fire hydrant was knocked over and the front wheel of the car came off the car and there was debris across the road.' The court heard he had a string of convictions including failing to provide a specimen for analysis in 2004 and he was made subject to a community order for another matter in May last year. Rob Keel, defending, said the offence was one his client was 'deeply ashamed and embarrassed about'. Incident: Masood  drove over a roundabout in Broxtowe Lane, Strelley, pictured, and crashed on the other side. He then told police: 'I've crashed my car, I've had lots and I don't have a driving licence' Mr Keel added: 'It was a vehicle he borrowed and he fully accepts drinking a considerable amount of alcohol.' 'Fortuitously no other parties were involved - he simply drove over a roundabout and knocked over a fire hydrant.' 'He tells me he has found his faith again, he is a practising Muslim, and he has moved away from Nottingham and the negative influences and issues that were dragging him down. 'He is also drink and drug-free.'","Asif Masood, 40, ploughed friend's Ford Focus into Nottingham hydrant .

"A Swiss artist who made headlines last year by pushing paint-filled eggs out of her vagina has caused another stir by walking around a museum starkers while carrying a baby. Red-faced visitors including many children were left stunned as brunette Milo Moire, 32, sauntered around the LWL Museum for Art and Culture in the town of Munster in northwest Germany as part of her Naked Life exhibition, which sees her stripping off to express her art. The artist was slated last year by critics as 'absurd, gratuitous, trite and desperate' for her Plop-Egg exhibition. Naked art: Milo Moire, 32, was naked as she carried a baby around the LWL Museum for Art and Culture . Her website however described her work as 'volcanic explosions of colour from her vagina', and now she has been filmed holding the naked baby while looking at paintings of nudes. Art-lover Tobias Meyer, 45, said: 'I must admit it was more interesting than the average art exhibition.' Mixed reaction: Art lovers are torn in their assessment of 'A naked infant safe in the arms of a naked woman' at a gallery in Munster, Germany . But other museum visitors were left unimpressed. Anke Lange, 30, said: 'I'm all for expression and alternatives in art, but this was just ridiculous. 'From what I gather, she thinks that getting her clothes off, looking at paintings of nude people and holding a naked baby makes her become part of the art.'

"FIFA's general secretary Jerome Valcke has claimed UEFA and most of the confederations want December 23 as the date for the Qatar 2022 World Cup final - but that no decision has been made and no compensation will be paid. A FIFA task force on Tuesday recommended that the 2022 tournament should be played in late November to late December to avoid the heat of the summer. The Premier League and Football Association say a final that close to Christmas will cause havoc with the traditional festive club programme and will campaign for an earlier final date ahead of the decision by FIFA's executive committee on March 20. FIFA's general secretary Jerome Valcke said a December 23 final for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is supported by UEFA and the majority of the confederations, but a decision will be made in March . Valcke also ruled out compensation for leagues who lose out with the schedule saying the already get a cut of what FIFA makes out of the World Cup . December 18 remains a strong possibility - it is Qatar's national day and also falls on a Sunday, and would be early enough for the festive club programme to take place. Valcke also confirmed that the 2022 World Cup will be four days shorter as a 'concession' to the league and clubs, 28 days instead of the usual 32, and that the African Nations Cup in 2023 will be moved to June from January. He also said no apology was necessary to the clubs despite the disruption it will cause to domestic football across the globe. He also ruled out paying compensation - European Clubs' Association (ECA) chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Tuesday said the clubs would demand financial settlements for the disruption. Sepp Blatter with the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani as he celebrates his country winning the right to host the World Cup in 2022 that is set to ruin the English tradition of Christmas football . The FIFA task force members, including Richard Scudamore (circled), met on Monday in Doha . Valcke told a news conference in Doha after a Qatar 2022 organising committee board meeting: 'It's not perfect, we know that - but why are we talking about compensation? It's happening once we're not destroying football. 'Why should we apologise to the clubs? We have had an agreement with the clubs that they are part of the beneficiaries. It was 40 million (US) dollars in 2010 and 70 million in 2014. 'We are bringing all our people to enjoy the sporting and financial results of the World Cup. 'I definitely don't feel I have to apologise for the decision made yesterday to confirm that the World Cup will not be played in the summer.' He added: 'Most confederations say they want the World Cup to end on the 23rd of December.' Valcke also appeared to confirm the deal to extend the USA TV rights deal with Fox to include the 2026 World Cup had been done to avert the threat of any legal action over its 2022 deal. He said: 'We have done what we had to do in order to protect FIFA and the organisation of the World Cup.' Premier League CEO Richard Scudamore expressed disappointment at the proposed schedule for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar . We are extremely disappointed with the FIFA Task Force recommendation to move the 2022 FIFA World Cup to a November and December schedule. It is clear that the views of the European leagues, along with the numerous other competitions globally that will be negatively affected, have not been given serious consideration throughout this process. The prevailing view from the leagues has been that displacing the 2022 World Cup significantly from the original summer dates disproportionately impacts the sporting integrity of our competitions. Our particular concern is that a FIFA World Cup that finishes late in December could result in damaging one of the English game’s great traditions and attractions, with the removal of the entire Premier League, Football League and FA Cup Christmas and New Year fixture programme that season. Clearly there is still time within the process to consider our position further, but first we will consult with our clubs, other stakeholders in English football, and other leagues before deciding on what, if any, further action might be appropriate or worthwhile. Meanwhile Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan said there was no surprise in the decision to stage a winter World Cup in Qatar but that the actual timing could be crucial. Regan told Press Association Sport: 'We have been expecting this decision for some time, but it is going to run late into December and just how close to Christmas it gets is something that needs to be thought through. 'We will look at the knock-on effects of the decision and how it will affect Scottish football - clearly there will be fixture challenges for leagues across the world.' October, November and December are the only months the 2022 World Cup can be held, according to a graphic provided by the FIFA task force . On Tuesday, FA chairman Greg Dyke told Press Association Sport: 'We will have to wait to hear the detail but we will try to protect all the traditional Christmas dates.' Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, who was on the task force that met in Doha on Tuesday, added: 'Our particular concern is that a FIFA World Cup that finishes late in December could result in damaging one of the English game's great traditions and attractions, with the removal of the entire Premier League, Football League and FA Cup Christmas and new year fixture programme that season.' When will the 2022 World Cup in Qatar run? The exact dates have yet to be confirmed but ‘late November to late December’ 2022 has been recommended by FIFA’s task force, with Saturday November 26 to Friday December 23 mooted as a possible 28-day slot. A final decision is expected on March 20. A World Cup final near to Christmas sounds crazy... It would mean travel chaos over an already tricky holiday time. There is sure to be lobbying to play the final earlier, perhaps on Sunday December 18, which is also Qatar National Day. What’s the problem with having an earlier final? Whenever it’s played, domestic seasons will need to stop weeks before the first match to allow squads to prepare. Typically this run-up period is a month. It will need to be a minimum of two weeks. A World Cup ending on December 23 would mean domestic competitions breaking in early November. Any earlier and football might have to stop as early as October. What happens to the 2022-23 Premier League season? Two months of club football will be ‘displaced’, and if the period cleared for the World Cup is as mooted, that will essentially be November and December. That would mean 10 Premier League games and three Champions League games being played earlier or later. So, for example, the Premier League season may have to start a month earlier (mid-July 2022) and finish a month later (mid-June 2023). The seasons before and after would also need to shift to accommodate this. There will be disruption, to about 50 leagues, for about three years. What about the Football League? Club football across England would almost certainly be suspended for a chunk of the World Cup as FIFA insist on a ‘blackout’ of about 20 days when no attention is taken from their showpiece. How will the fixture congestion affect domestic action? FA Cup replays could be one victim for at least a season. Premier League clubs might play fewer League Cup games. Some European competition fixtures will need to be rescheduled. The Africa Cup of Nations due for January 2023 may have to be shelved. Will the move to winter hit clubs in the pocket? Almost certainly in terms of missing out on the holiday-season bonanza of capacity crowds, but also untold millions if TV companies bid less for disrupted domestic seasons. Arguably hardest hit will be smaller Football League clubs, reliant on turnstile cash, who are forced to go without games — and income — for weeks. What do Sky and BT Sport think? Both broadcasters declined to comment. But by 2022-23, we will be two more Premier League TV deals down the line after the £5billion extravaganza just agreed. Who knows who will have UK live rights then? Maybe beIN Sports… based in Qatar! You’re not serious? That’s what several hundred million fans said when it was announced in December 2010 that Qatar would host 2022. Rule out nothing, no matter how seemingly ridiculous or outrageous. Is there any chance this ALL won’t even happen? Very little. And when FIFA announce a world-record sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways later this year, as insiders expect, none at all. Merry Christmas!","UEFA and most confederations prefer December 23 as the final date .

"An 18-month-old boy has died in Berlin after suffering from measles becoming the first known death of the disease in an outbreak in the German capital. Authorities believe the outbreak began with a child asylum-seeker from Bosnia, which spread to the wider population. So far there have been 570 cases of measles in the city since October. A doctor prepares a measles vaccine at a clinic in Berlin. An 18-month-old boy has become the first known death of the disease in an outbreak in the German capital . An autopsy on the toddler, who died last week but has not been named, revealed he wasn't immunised against the disease and was suffering another medical condition. But the Charite Hospital added that is pre-exisitng health problems would not have led to his death. Measles has spread so quickly as many older adults in Germany were never immunised against the disease and many younger adults did not receive the full course of the vaccine. German health minister Hermann Groehe has called for increased efforts to ensure that children are vaccinated. He has even suggested if that doesn't succeed, authorities might consider making it mandatory, though he said that isn't currently on the agenda. Elsewhere a Berlin secondary school was closed as a precaution on Monday because a student had measles, but reopened Tuesday. The toddler had been treated at the Charite hospital in Berlin, who said his pre-existing health condition would not have contributed to his death . Officials checked students' and teachers' vaccination records and local health official Sibyll Klotz said five students who couldn't show that they were properly vaccinated were sent home. Measles is highly contagious and health officials say more than 90 per cent of a population needs to be vaccinated to prevent outbreaks. Vaccination rates across Europe fell after a now-discredited study that suggested a link between autism and the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. Health officials recommend immunisation in children at 12 to 15 months of age, followed by a second dose for full protection. The second shot can be given either one month later or before the child starts school, at four to six- years-old, according to the Centers for Disease Control in the United States, which adopted the two-dose protocol in 1989. The measles and SV rubeola viruses. It is thought the latest measles outbreak in Berlin originated from a sick child who travelled to Germany to seek asylum . The measles vaccine was only developed about 50 years ago, which would explain why many older adults weren't immunised. Germany has had a nationwide recommendation of a two-shot regimen only since 1991, so many younger adults may not have received the second dose. The German measles outbreak coincides with smaller ones in the United States tied to Disneyland in California and an Illinois day care center, which in total make up less than 150 cases. Officials say at least two of the measles cases in Berlin have been linked to the U.S. — one person who developed symptoms there before traveling to Germany, and another who developed the infection after returning from the U.S.","Toddler has become the first known death in an outbreak in German capital .

"The owner of a maraschino cherry company shot himself dead on Tuesday as police broke into a secret drug lab hidden behind the factory walls. Company president Arthur Mondella, 57, had cooperated with investigators for five hours who were at Dell's Maraschino Cherries factory in Brooklyn, New York over allegations the generations-old, family business had been dumping hazardous waste. Investigators reportedly came across suspicious shelving in a storage unit - then behind a door found a false wall with the smell of weed seeping through. The entrance to a dug-out basement was then found, with three bags of marijuana inside. Scroll down for video . Arthur Mondella, (pictured) 57, the owner of Dell's Maraschino Cherries, shot himself in his office bathroom at the company's factory in Brooklyn . FBI crime scene investigators leave the maraschino cherry factory in Brooklyn with bags of evidence on Tuesday . A pot operation was found to be operating behind the walls of the family business during a separate investigation into hazardous waste . The factory floor at Dell's Maraschino Cherries - behind the owner's office, shelves of pot and hundreds of thousands of dollars was discovered . According to the NY Post, generators were found inside the factory along with a high-tech security outfit of dozens of cameras, barbed wire and motion-detector lights. Mondella then excused himself to go to his private bathroom, locked the door and shot himself at 1.30pm, a law enforcement source told Daily Mail Online. Before committing suicide, the third-generation cherry tycoon told his sister who was present, Joanne Capece, to 'take care of my kids'. Those present heard a single gunshot, according to CBS New York.  Mondella later died at a local hospital from the .357 magnum gunshot wound.

Mondella had a gun permit but it was unclear if he was carrying weapons at the time. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from the Brooklyn District Attorney's office on Wednesday. The DA's office and environmental regulators discovered 80lbs of pot in three large bags and hundreds of thousands of dollars concealed in the secret room. Shelves operated by magnets had been used to conceal the operation. A row of luxury, vintage cars were also found covered in tarp in a back lot of the factory in the  industrial area of Red Hook. Calls to the business went unanswered on Wednesday. Investigators had been looking into the company over allegations it was dumping hazardous material into the sewage system and waterways - but had suspected that the facility was also being used as a grow lab. Hundreds of thousands of dollars along with 80lbs of marijuana were reportedly discovered in the secret room behind the factory walls in Brooklyn, New York . One official told the New York Daily News: 'It appears there was another activity going on, that's for sure. I don't think you kill yourself over a bag of weed. There has to be more to it.' Brooklyn District Attorney's office had received a tip-off about the marijuana operation in 2013, the New York Post reported. Despite watching comings and goings at the factory for six months, the DA's office was unable to work out if there was a marijuana business operating inside. An anonymous source told the paper that the environmental offense warrants were simply used to get into the building. The DA's office said 'no further information about this tragedy is available at this time'. Officers consult paper work during the investigation of the cherry factory on Tuesday.

Arthur Mondella's grandfather, Arthur Mondella Sr, started the business as a Brooklyn storefront in 1948. The Brooklyn factory now turns out 400,000 bottles of cherries each week - and 19 million pounds of cherries a year. The company recently underwent a $5million overhaul and redesigned their bottles with a retro label last year after the company suffered following the financial crash in 2008. At the time Mr Mondella told The Wall Street Journal: 'At this point, the maraschino cherry is just another commodity. We’re trying to change that.' Some 25 investigators arrived at the facility at 8am on Tuesday with search warrants to inspect its operations. Mondella is survived by his ex-wife Yevgeniya and their five-year-old daughter Antoinette.

As reported by Hello the queen did not let the setback stop her from looking her best, as she sported a flattering orange-and-black block colour pencil dress. Even while holding on to her husband of 16 years so as not to fall, while the couple were welcomed to the meeting by EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Mathilde maintained her poise. She and Philippe were also greeted by Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament. The queen showed no signs of pain or made any complaints. The group stopped to have their photographs taken, at which point Mathilde gave her crutches to her aide. With a little help from her husband, she was able to stand upright, linking arms with Philippe. Next up was a visit to the European Council building in the afternoon during the royal tour of EU institutions. The royal palace would only confirm that Mathilde had sustained a knee injury during a fall. She will not need an operation but will have to wear the brace for several weeks.

"London Fashion Week, which wound to a close yesterday, came and went quicker than you can say Alexa Chung. While many people dismiss the five-day style event in the capital as nothing more than ridiculous, a lot of what the designers showcased on the runway will actually be filling our wardrobes in months to come. From the more wearable trends - such as Burberry and Matthew Williamson's boho vibes - to the downright bizarre looks - like Sophia Webster's full glitter faces and Giles's Victorian doll inspired looks - FEMAIL has compiled the most weird and wonderful trends to emerge from London fashion week. BOHO VIBES . The most accessible trend to come out of fashion week was the Sevenites revival. Bohemian vibes were most prominent at Burberry, with a show called Patchwork, Pattern & Prints. Burberry's new arm candy, the bucket bag, was given a fringed makeover, as were the brand's winter ponytail booties. From beautiful boho vibes at Burberry, pictured, to weirdly wonderful designs elsewhere, FEMAIL has rounded up the best and worst trends to emerge from London Fashion Week . The fashion brand's staple trench succumbed to the new trend too, emerging with paisley prints in blossom hues. Teal and olive maxi dresses also made a comeback and were worn with the tiniest of waistcoats. Mosaic-encrusted tops, quilted floral jackets, and patchwork leggings rocked the runway, with the occasional injection of leopard-print making a graphic statement. Similarly, Matthew Williamson stuck to his signature boho style by unveiling a mystical and bright hued collection  inspired by the signs of the Zodiac. Flowing silk dresses came slashed to the hip and were often embellished with bold blue crystals inspired by birth flowers, horoscope signs and stones. Fur is officially in fashion come autumn, if Matthew's catwalk is anything to go by - his shaggy Mongolian lamb and shearling in topaz, teal, and pink sent Instagram into a furry frenzy. Boho is back, according to Burberry, where Christopher Bailey sent models down the runway in mosaic-encrusted tops, quilted floral jackets, and patchwork leggings . Matthew Williamson stuck to his signature boho style by unveiling a mystical and bright hued collection inspired by horoscopes . VICTORIANA FASHION . Designers often look to the past for inspiration but it seems that this season, many delved deep into their archives by taking the Victorian age as their point of reference. Design duo Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker exhibited an affinity towards the dark side at their AW15 show on Friday night. The relentlessly alluring theme of Gothic romanticism seeped throughout the collection - named Persephone - thanks to delicate fabrics and feminine details nostalgic of the Victorian age. Frills were rife, dominating the collars or lining the dress, and even made their mark on footwear. Silk blouses and sheer fabrics flowed down the runway, followed by luxurious felt wool coats that embraced winter’s charm and highlighted the feminine silhouette. There were similar scenes at Giles, with models sent down the runway with black lips, pale complexions and ruffled collars with silk bows galore. Frills were rife at PPQ, dominating the collars or lining the dress, and even made their mark on footwear . The Giles show was full of Victorian vibes as he sent models down the runway with ruffled collared shirts with silk bows galore . BONDAGE . Julien Macdonald is unapologetic about his love for high octane glamour, but his AW15 collection was a departure from the usual feast of glitter and sequins that he has made his signature. The Welsh designer and Strictly Come Dancing star embraced gothic glamour in his London show. Julien's racy designs were overtly sexual but managed to maintain that sense of sophistication that makes him a red carpet favourite. Julien Macdonald was one of many designers to embrace gothic glamour and all things racy in London this season . Dominatrix-esque models took to the runway wearing thick chokers, long black gloves and embellished luxe silks. Dresses, both long and short, came with peek-a-boo cutouts and were worn with thigh-high leggings, ensuring the Julien woman garners attention for all the right reasons. Marko Mitanovski, a firm favourite of Lady Gaga, also embraced the bondage theme by sending models down the runway wearing full fishnet bodysuits  with just a thong underneath. The Serbian designer's catwalk was awash with masks, collars and corsets in leather and croc, with some faces completely covered in black paint. Meanwhile, Sophia Webster  the queen of quirky footwear - incorporated the bondage theme into her show designs with thigh-high strappy sandals with leather detailing, as well as bags emblazoned with the words 'Freak Like Me'. Dominatrix-esque models took to the runway at Marko Mitanovski wearing fishnets and exposing plenty of flesh . Serbian designer Marko Mitanovski took the corset to a whole new level, sending his models out wearing nose-to-toe versions . Sophia Webster's collection, appropriately named Freak Like Me, showcased thigh high strappy sandals with leather and matching bags . The Sophia Webster presentation during London Fashion Week was, rather fittingly, named Freak Like Me . Pam Hogg's show was a feast of leather and PVC, centre, and satin, right, with Alice Dellal taking to the catwalk in sheer pants adorned with ribbons and bows, left . ACCESSORISE ALL AREAS . Roadwork emblazoned handbags, neon furs and orb headbands are just a few of the ways we will be accessorising come autumn. Queen of the tote, Anya Hindmarch - who is one of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite bag designers - performed her usual magic of turning mundane everyday items into desirable accessories that often attract a long waiting list. For her autumn/winter 2015 line, entitled 'The Diversion Collection'. Anya was influenced by Britain's motorways, with models marching down a catwalk decorated with road markings and overseen by LED speed limits. Motifs for this season stepped away from the busy sticker theme of her last collection, with bags stamped with traffic signs like 'road works ahead' and 'no U-turn.' Perhaps one of the most unique items in the collection is the Eddie Stobart clutch that is a miniature replica of the motorway regulars. As for headwear, models at Ashley Williams wore the furriest shearling bucket hats, while Gyo Yuni Kimchoe decorated models in space age style helmets with animal horns and tassled ribbon necklaces, and Sophia Webster's headbands came adorned with orbs.

Perhaps one of the most unique items in the collection is the Eddie Stobart clutch that is a miniature replica of the motorway regulars, left, and the Little Chef themed tote was also a hit, right . Hats at the Ashley Williams show came in the softest sheepskin and shearling textures (even if the models could barely see beneath them) Accessories took on a whole new meaning at Gyo Yuni Kimchoe, where male models wore space age style helmets with animal horns and tassled ribbon necklaces . Sophia Webster's girls wore headbands with giant gold orbs attached to them . Roksanda Ilincic is the master of colour blocking and her AW15 footwear was no exception . Acid-coloured chubby furs and bags provided some eye-catching additions to Roksanda's catwalk . BOLD BEAUTY: INTERESTING EYES, GLITTER-FILLED FACES AND POLKA DOT MAKE-UP . It isn't just the clothes designers who create the new trends at London Fashion Week. Behind the scenes, the most talented hair and make-up artists in the world work like a well-oiled machine to set the next season's beauty trends - and if they have anything to do with it, we'll be wearing fake freckles, smudged lipstick or perhaps even no make-up at all come next autumn. FEMAIL went backstage to meet the hotbed of talent conjuring up AW15's beauty looks and from what we've witnessed, you'll be getting creative in six months' time (so get your glitter at the ready). Portuguese designers Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida for Marques' Almeida sent models down their runway with  white eyelashes, while Val Garland decorated models' eyes with sequins. At Matthew Williamson, Benefit's Lisa Potter-Dixon created a new take on eyeliner being dubbed 'displaced liner,' by applying a sweep on the models' sockets rather than on their waterline. Sophia Webster, always one to push quirky trends, asked  Sharon Dowsett fom L'Oreal Paris to completely coat some of the models' faces in glitter. Elsewhere, other models were given totally white faces with a bold glitter lip. Models at Marques' Almeida, left, had lashings of white mascara applied to their eyes, whilst at Temperley, right, models' eye sockets were adorned with glitter and sequins . Sharon Dowsett from L'Oreal Paris completely coated some of the models' faces in glitter at Sophia Webster, right, and others were given totally white faces, left . At Dora Abodi, models faces were painted white all over and tiny polkadots were applied using marker pen . Not only did the models at Dora Abodi have quirky make-up, but their hair left something to be desired too .","London Fashion Week has covered a huge amount of trends over the last few days .

"A ballet dancer is on target to waltz his way to fame with a series of gravity-defying photographs which could well be the ultimate self portraits. Tourists wandering through the cobbled streets of Paris would stand in awe as they saw Mickael Jou performing his dance routines ranging from ballet to more modern moves. Snapping away with their cameras as Mickael performed pirouettes through the air, old and young alike would then share their magical pictures with the dancer. Mickael Jou seemingly floats through the air as he chats to a woman while people enjoy a picnic in the background, . Mickael, who now lives in Berlin, said seeing the snaps inspired him to start his own project, enabling him to marry his love of dance with photography using a variety of locations as a backdrop. 'Tourists would quite often photograph and film me dancing in Paris, and after seeing the pictures they'd taken of me, I figured that I should try it out for myself,' said Mickael. After wandering around the Louvre art gallery in Paris for inspiration, Mickael bought a camera of his own and pored over the manual until he knew exactly how to use all the features and time his dance moves to coincide with the shutter speed. Poised as if to pick a flower, Mickael strikes a pose mid-air . Over the past three years,he has collected an assortment of snaps which show him dancing through the air for his 365 photo project. I’ve spent  three years working on this 365 photo project and it will probably take  another three years to finish it,' he added. Uploading the photographs onto his website, viewers will be able to see  Mickael almost floating through the air on a beach, beside a hotel and in woodland. The 30-year-old said he puts a lot of thought into the location of his photographs with some of the snaps taking minutes to shoot and others much longer. 'I pick out a location, and then I set-up my tripod and I have a remote control that I press,' he said. 'Of course, I also adjust photographic settings such as the aperture, but the tripod and the remote control is how I manage to photograph myself. 'Taking a picture can take anywhere from five minutes to an hour. Sometimes I get lucky and have lots of time to take a picture, but sometimes I have constraints and no time at all, for instance if the sunlight changes or the other people in the picture can't stay.' Mickael said that while it looks like there is  just him at a particular spot, there is usually a throng of people behind the camera. 'Passers-by often stop and ask what I'm doing or even take pictures of me taking pictures of myself,' said Mickael. 'I've had groups of 50 people cheer me on as I take a picture, which kind of feels like a sports match, but with dancing!' In a scene which could have come straight from a science fiction film, Mickael floats through a woodland . Mickael said that while the self-portraits are a hobby, he does occasionally sell them as well. 'Eleven of my pictures are currently hanging up at a bar in Berlin, the Mokkabar, Gneisenaustraße 93,' he said. 'This project is very personal to me, but I'm always glad if people enjoy my pictures. I used to work in marketing in Paris, but now I'm based in Berlin and working as a photographer's assistant to get some more experience. 'I began dancing when I was 18 and I actually like anything to do with exercise and will do stretching most days.' Mickael, who said his dream job would be to work as a fashion or commercial photographer, said children watching him dancing and taking photographs often tried to copy him. 'When I'm doing the splits, I often see little children trying to do them as well - it's really cute,' he added. Anyone who would like to see more of Mickael Jou's work can do so at www.facebook.com/mickaeljouphotographydance or www.mickaeljou.com .

"Early risers across much of Arizona were treated to pink skies as a Nasa research rocket launched into the atmosphere. The rocket blasted off from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico at 5:26 am local time (12.26 GMT). A bright pink cloud was visible for the next 20 minutes as sunlight hit the rocket's vapour trail. Early risers across Arizona were treated to pink skies as a Nasa research rocket launched into the atmosphere. A bright pink cloud was visible for the next 20 minutes as sunlight hit the rocket's vapour trail . News outlets in Arizona reported that residents in Phoenix, Tucson, Lake Havasu City and Flagstaff reported seeing the pink cloud. The Terrier-Black Brant rocket carried an atmospheric-research payload designed by scientists and engineers at a space-vehicles research lab at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque. The white 'tracer cloud' was made up of trimethyl aluminum, and the red cloud, consisted of lithium vapour. White Sands officials said the rocket's release of vapour into the near-vacuum of space was intended to help study processes responsible for the formation of the Earth's ionosphere. This photo shows a Nasa Terrier-Black Brant research rocket that launched from White Sands Missile Range . White Sands officials said the rocket's release of vapour into the near-vacuum of space was intended to help study processes responsible for the formation of the Earth's ionosphere . That's a region of space where electrons naturally separate from molecules and float separately to create an ionised gas. The ionosphere is a crucial layer of charged particles surrounding our planet. This layer serves as the medium through which high frequency radio waves – such as those sent down to the ground by global positioning system (GPS) satellites or, indeed, any satellite communicating with Earth – travel. The ionosphere begins about 60 miles above the ground and is filled with electrons and ions. After releasing the rocket, researchers then visually observed the movement of the vapour as it traces the motions of background environment. This  will help scientists better understand and predict the electrical storms in Earth's upper atmosphere. GPS signal delays caused by activity in the ionosphere are measured in metres, with large delays being on the order of 40 metres, says Lawrence Sparks, senior technologist with the Ionospheric and Atmospheric Remote Sensing Group at JPL. While it doesn't take long for signals traveling at the speed of light to cover 40 metres, he says, even a delay of a small fraction of a second can make a significant difference in determining the position of a fast-moving plane. 'It is crucial to bound the positioning errors accurately for landing an aircraft safely in fog, for example,' he said. Nasa likens this technique to injecting a small, harmless dye into a river or stream, to study its currents, eddies, and other motions. The rocket was provided under a Department of Defense test program at Kirtland, while a Nasa rocket program provided technical expertise for its assembly and other parts of the mission. The launch was postponed from Monday because of weather. A similar experiment took place last year over the Marshall Islands (pictured).  After releasing the rocket in space, researchers then visually observed the subsequent movement of the vapour as it traces the motions of background environment . The rocket blasted off from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico at 5:26 am local time (12.26 GMT) When high frequency radio waves, such as those used for the Global Positioning System (GPS) travel through a disturbed layer of Earth's electrically charged atmosphere, the ionosphere, they can be disrupted .","Clouds seen in Phoenix, Tucson, Lake Havasu City and Flagstaff .

"Filmmaker Roman Polanski appeared in a court in Poland on Wednesday for a hearing concerning a U.S. request for his extradition charges of sex with a minor, a case that has haunted him since 1977. Judge Dariusz Mazur was not expected to make a ruling on Wednesday and scheduled another hearing, buying time to study documents that arrived this week from Switzerland, which in 2010 refused to extradite Polanski. The next hearing could be in April or sooner, according to court spokeswoman Grazyna Rokita. Scroll down for video . Filmmaker Roman Polanski, center, with his lawyers, appeared in the court for a hearing concerning a U.S. request for his extradition over 1977 charges of sex with a minor . Wearing a dark suit, the Oscar-winning director entered the court in Krakow with his two Polish lawyers. On the attorneys' request, the court banned media from the hearing. Polanski, 81, is in Poland preparing to make a movie about Alfred Dreyfus, a 19th-century French army officer wrongly accused of spying. Prosecutors in Polanski's childhood city of Krakow, where he has an apartment, have refused a U.S. request to arrest him, but have said there are no legal obstacles to his extradition and have asked the court for a ruling. If the judge refuses to hand Polanski over, the case is closed. If he allows the extradition, the final decision will belong to the justice minister. The Oscar-winning director is a celebrity in Poland, where many politicians have indicated reluctance to hand him over, arguing he has already paid a heavy price and repented for what he did. An Interpol warrant for Polanski's arrest is in effect in 188 countries. He avoids extradition by traveling only between France, Poland and Switzerland. He has French and Polish passports. The Oscar-winning director, pictured right on Wednesday and left in 1977, is a celebrity in Poland, where many politicians have indicated reluctance to hand him over, arguing he has already paid a heavy price and repented for what he did . Polanski, director of classics like Rosemary’s Baby and Chinatown, pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer during a photoshoot in Los Angeles. He served 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea bargain in 1977 before he fled the United States on the eve of his sentencing the following year. In 2009, he was arrested in Zurich on a U.S. warrant and placed under house arrest but was freed the following year after Swiss authorities decided not to extradite him. In 2013, Mrs Geimer described in graphic detail for the first time what happened on the day of the attack in Jack Nicholson’s LA home. In her book, The Girl, she wrote about how Polanski told her mother he wanted to take pictures of the teen for French Vogue but would not allow her to accompany her daughter. In her book, The Girl, Geimer, left, revealed that Polanski first plied her with champagne, taking pictures of her in the Jacuzzi in just her underwear before giving her a sleeping pill .

Describing the sexual assault, Mrs Geimer revealed that Polanski first plied her with champagne, taking pictures of her in the Jacuzzi in just her underwear before giving her a sleeping pill. During the screening of a documentary of his life at the Zurich Film Festival in 2011, Polanski said Mrs Geimer was a ‘double victim’ after she was caught up in the media glare of his arrest in 2009.","The Oscar-winning director is fighting extradition to the U.S. in connection with charges of having sex with a minor in the 1970s .

"A television crew captured this astonishing footage which appears to show a purple disc-shaped UFO hovering about a city construction site. The production crew in Lima, Peru, were filming a programme when they interrupted it in order to  focus on what appears to be a 'UFO' hovering over the city. The purple-colored disc-shaped object can be seen hovering in the  sky near a construction site, but so far, there has been no official explanation for the object. The purple-colored disc-shaped object (pictured) was spotted hovering in the sky  in the city of Lima, in Peru . The unidentified purple object was seen above this construction site - it can be seen just under the crane . According to Peru This Week, television show 'Alto al Crimen' - an investigative program aimed at preventing high level crime - was shooting an episode in the upscale Miraflores district of Lima on February 10 when they spotted the unusual object. The show's host, Lima Congressman Renzo Reggiardo, halted an interview in order to allow his camera operator to focus on the strange-looking purple object in the sky. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the object hovering over the city for up to two hours. Thousands of people have taken to social media to discuss what they think the mysterious purple object is and the video has already been viewed more than 100,000 times. The production crew in Lima, Peru, were filming a programme when they spotted what appears to be a 'UFO' The Raelian movement, a UFO religion, are delighted by the spotting and claim the UFO is somehow linked to their initiative to persuade the Peruvian government to build an extraterrestrial embassy in the country . Some suggest it is a drone or kite or a hologram projected into the sky. Other people believe it could be proof of extraterrestrial life, while one person said that they think it is a 'plastic bag'. Adding more mystery to the UFO sighting are claims that the UFO is somehow linked to an initiative currently underway by the Raelian movement - a UFO religion - to persuade the Peruvian government to build an extraterrestrial embassy, reports The Examiner. Raëlism, also known as Raelianism or the Raëlian movement, is a UFO religion that was founded in 1974. The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim. Members of this species appeared human and when having personal contacts with the descendants of the humans they made, they previously misinformed (on purpose) early humanity that they were angels, cherubim or gods. Raëlians believe messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha,Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. Erich Rever of the Peruvian Raelian Movement said: 'This UFO appeared right when we held a press conference to present our embassy project plan, which we have submitted to the Peruvian government. 'Peru must be dear to our extraterrestrial creators, who lived here in ancient times and left many traces, so we're asking the government for permission to build the embassy here. 'It's a wonderful opportunity for Peruvians to understand their past and, more importantly, to consider receiving our creators, the Elohim, who were taken for gods by our ancestors and now ask to be welcomed back. 'We're hoping the Peruvian government will receive their request loud and clear!' The Peru chapter of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) is investigating and says it is seeking more eyewitnesses who may have videotaped the purple aerial object from different vantage points.","Television crew captured purple disc-shaped UFO hovering over Lima .

"Oscar Pistorious's lawyers have launched a bid to prevent prosecutors appealing his manslaughter conviction ahead of a a possible new murder trial over the death of Reeva Steenkamp. Lawyers for the jailed South African Olympic said yesterday they have launched a legal bid to prevent prosecutors from appealing against his acquittal on murder charges. Prosecutors want Pistorius, 28, convicted of the more serious crime of murder for shooting girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013 - and in December they were granted permission by Judge Thokozile Masipa  to appeal against his acquittal. Scroll down for video . Lawyers for jailed South African Olympic Oscar Pistorius (pictured during his trial) have announced they have launched a legal bid to prevent prosecutors from appealing against his acquittal on murder charges . The double amputee athlete was acquitted by Judge Masipa of both premeditated murder and the lesser murder charge of dolus eventualis, also known as common-law murder. In South African law dolus eventualis applies if the accused knew they might kill someone but still went ahead with their course of action. Pistorius was instead convicted of culpable homicide, or manslaughter, and sentenced to five years in prison . Prosecutors argue that Judge Masipa misinterpreted the law when she cleared Pistorius of murder on the basis that he did not intentionally shoot Ms Steenkamp. But now defence lawyers are challenging the judge's decision to allow prosecutors to appeal as they do not want the culpable homicide verdict to be overturned . Pistorius and model Reeva Steenkamp in 2012 - he fatally shot her on Valentine's Day 2013 at his home . Pistorius lawyers' said in a brief statement yesterday that they have applied to argue against allowing prosecutors to appeal. Their application will be heard in court on March 13. Pistorius's legal team say his conviction was based on facts presented during the trial, not on an interpretation of law, and therefore cannot be appealed. 'We will argue that these are matters of fact, rather than matters of law,' they said in a statement. Judge Masipa presided over Pistorius' seven-month murder trial last year and heard how hr shot Reeva Steenkamp multiple times through a closed toilet door in his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day. She ruled Pistorius, known as the 'Blade Runner' for his prosthetic legs he wears on the track, did not intend to kill Reeva and acquitted him of murder, but found he acted negligently when he fired four times through the door from close range with his 9 mm pistol. During the trial, Pistorius testified that he shot the model four times through a locked toilet door, believing she was an intruder. Kgosi Mampuru 2 Management Area Prison where Pistorius is serving his five-year sentence in Pretoria . Prosecutors argued he deliberately killed the 29-year-old law graduate after an argument, but Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled they had failed to prove intent. If the Supreme Court of Appeal finds that Pistorius should have been found guilty of murder, as prosecutors contend, he faces a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison. But the challenge by his lawyers to the appeal is likely to delay the process. Pistorius's trial last year attracted massive international interest and revealed a darker side to the once-revered athlete. He is currently serving his prison term in the hospital ward of a Pretoria prison, away from the often overcrowded cells of South Africa's jails, which are notorious for gang violence. He could be eligible to be moved to house arrest in August, when he may be able to serve the remainder of his sentence at his uncle's home.","Prosecutors want to appeal Oscar Pistorius's manslaughter conviction .

"Kelly-Marie Earp, 33, fell and banged her head in the shower at her home in Midway, Derbyshire, but didn't realise she was badly hurt. She died six days later . A mother of two died from a slow bleed on the brain six days after she fell and banged her head in the shower, an inquest heard. Kelly-Marie Earp, 33, slipped and banged her head in the shower at her home in Midway, Derbyshire, but didn't realise she was badly hurt. She spent the following day enjoying a Sunday lunch with her family before collapsing and suffering confusion. The single mother was later taken to hospital and operated on but died from 'an acute subdural haematoma' as a result of 'blunt impact injury to the head'. The inquest into her death at South Derbyshire Coroner's Court yesterday heard that it was not uncommon for there to be a 'lucid period' after someone had suffered a head injury. The hearing was told that Ms Earp had spent much of the day with her sister on July 19 last year before returning to her own house at 8.30pm. She had a shower, during which she slipped and banged her head, and returned to her sister's home 45 minutes later complaining of a bump on the head. However, Ms Earp – who is mother to Josh, 13, and Macy, five – thought nothing more of it and returned home later that evening. She spent the following day at her mother's house where she enjoyed a Sunday lunch with her family and could be seen laughing and joking. Her mother Caroline Earp told the inquest: 'I remember her laughing when she arrived for lunch. 'There were two cars parked outside and she couldn't get between them and so she'd had to drive the long way round.' However, after later returning home, Ms Earp was found semi-conscious in the living room by her son Josh. The teenager came home to find his mother slumped over after being dropped off by his father, with whom he had spent the weekend. Coroner Louise Pinder recorded a conclusion of accidental death at South Derbyshire Coroner's Court (above) Detective Constable Thomas Wagg, of Derbyshire Police, told the hearing how Josh tried to rouse her in order to go to bed but she told him she believed she was already in bed. Mr Wagg added: 'Josh rang his father who advised him to leave her where she was. 'The following morning, about 7am, Josh still couldn't rouse his mum. 'There was no response from her at all. He rang his father again. He came to their home address, got them ready for school, came back and still couldn't rouse her and rang her sister Michelle.' The pair phoned 999 at about 9am on July 21 and Ms Earp was taken to Royal Derby Hospital where it was discovered that she had suffered a bleed to her brain. She was transferred to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham and operated on but died four days later on July 25. Consultant pathologist and forensic medical examiner Dr Andrew Hitchcock stated on the post-mortem examination report that Ms Earp died of 'an acute subdural haematoma' as a result of 'blunt impact injury to the head'. He said he could find no underlying disease that could have accounted for her collapsing in the shower. Coroner Louise Pinder recorded a conclusion of accidental death. After the inquest, Ms Earp's sister Tiffany, 25, said: 'She loved to be at parties with the family and friends – she was the life and soul and was the loudest one out of the lot of us. 'She loved her kids. We really miss her and it's not the same without her.' A subdural haematoma is a collection of clotting blood that puts pressure on the brain. It usually occurs as a result of a head injury and is a serious condition which usually requires emergency treatment. There are three types of a subdural haematoma: . A CT scan can show a subdural haematoma and an operation to remove the haematoma may be needed. Many people with a small subdural haematoma can make a quick and full recovery. However, in some cases it can lead to the damaging of brain tissues and in the worst cases a large haematoma on the brain can result in death. A subdural haematoma can occur at any age. However, some people are more at risk of developing a subdural haematoma after a head injury including people over the age of 60, because blood vessels around the brain become weaker, and babies. Subdural haematoma's are also more common in people who misuse alcohol because it can affect the clotting of blood and people who have consumed alcohol are more likely to fall and hit their head. People who take anticoagulation treatment, including aspirin, are also more prone to a subdural haematoma after a head injury. Anyone who has been knocked unconscious by a blow to the head, or who is vomiting after a knock, should go straight to an A&E department. People who have suffered a bang to the head, but may not be experiencing symptoms, should also seek medical help. Often hospitals will keep patients in 'for observation' after a bump to the head to ensure a subdural haematoma does not develop.","Kelly-Marie Earp fell and banged her head in shower on July 19 last year .

"We all know and love the moon. We're so assured that we only have one that we don't even give it a specific name. But the moon is not the Earth's only natural satellite. As recently as 1997, we discovered that another body, 3753 Cruithne, is what's called a quasi-orbital satellite of Earth. Now researchers believe its strange orbit may help scientists better understand how gravity helped planets form. Scroll down for video . A representation of Cruithne's strange orbit around the sun.  Cruithne scuttles around the inner solar system in what's called a 'horseshoe' orbit. This could provide an ideal testing ground for our understanding of how the solar system evolves under gravity . Cruithne doesn't loop around the Earth in a nice ellipse in the same way as the moon, or indeed the artificial satellites we loft into orbit. Instead, Cruithne scuttles around the inner solar system in what's called a 'horseshoe' orbit. To help understand why it's called a horseshoe orbit, imagine we're looking down at the solar system, rotating at the same rate as the Earth goes round the sun. From our viewpoint, the Earth looks stationary. A body on a simple horseshoe orbit around the Earth moves toward it, then turns round and moves away. Once it's moved so far away it's approaching Earth from the other side, it turns around and moves away again. Horseshoe orbits are quite common for moons in the solar system. Saturn has a couple of moons in this configuration, for instance. Cruithne, a 3 mile (5km) asteroid (animations shown above) is shown here. The yellow orbit in the animation shows Cruithne's orbit around Earth . What's unique about Cruithne is how it wobbles and sways along its horseshoe. If you look at Cruithne's motion in the solar system, it makes a messy ring around Earth's orbit, swinging so wide that it comes into the neighbourhood of both Venus and Mars. So what can we learn about the solar system from Cruithne? Quite a lot. Like the many other asteroids and comets, it contains forensic evidence about how the planets were assembled. Its kooky orbit is an ideal testing ground for our understanding of how the solar system evolves under gravity. It wasn't until the end of the 20th century that we even realised that bodies would enter such weird horseshoe orbits and stay there for such a long time. The fact they do shows us that such interactions will have occurred while the solar system was forming. The moon has been orbiting Earth for more than four billion years. But our planet’s faithful companion may not be alone. A new object, dubbed 2014 OL339, has been found masquerading as Earth’s ‘second moon’. The new ‘moon’, which is in fact a 490ft (150 metre) asteroid, takes about a year to orbit the sun and is close enough to Earth to look like its satellite. The peculiar object was accidentally discovered on July 29 by astronomer Farid Char of the Chilean University of Antofagasta. According to Rebecca Boyle writing in New Scientist, 2014 OL339 has been travelling near to our planet for about 775 years and it will continue to do so for another 165 years. It has an elliptical orbit and takes around 364.92 days to circle the sun once, meaning the asteroid and Earth are in ‘resonant orbits’. This happens when two orbiting bodies exert a gravitational influence on each other due to their orbits being closely related. Asteroid 2014 OL339 orbits the sun in a similar timeframe to Earth, but our planet’s gravity pushes it into an eccentric wobble. Because we think terrestrial planets grow via collisions of bodies of Cruithne-size and above, this is a big new variable. One day, Cruithne could be a practice site for landing humans on asteroids, and perhaps even mining them for the rare-earth metals our new technologies desperately crave. If Cruithne struck the Earth, though, that would be an extinction-level event, similar to what is believed to have occurred at the end of the Cretaceous period. Luckily it's not going to hit us anytime soon – its orbit is tilted out of the plane of the solar system, and astrophysicists have shown using simulations that while it can come quite close, it is extremely unlikely to hit us. The point where it is predicted to get closest is about 2,750 years away. If you look at Cruithne's motion in the solar system, it makes a messy ring around Earth's orbit, swinging so wide that it comes into the neighbourhood of both Venus (pictured) and Mars . Cruithne is expected to undergo a rather close encounter with Venus in about 8,000 years, however. There's a good chance that that will put paid to our erstwhile spare moon, flinging it out of harm's way, and out of the Terran family. The story doesn't end there. Like a good foster home, the Earth plays host to many wayward lumps of rock looking for a gravitational well to hang around near. Astronomers have actually detected several other quasi-orbital satellites that belong to the Earth, all here for a little while before caroming on to pastures new. Cruithne and these other satellites teach us that the solar system isn't eternal – and by extension, neither are we. This article originally appeared in The Conversation. It was written by Dr Duncan Forgan who is a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of St Andrews’ School of Physics and Astronomy.","Cruithne was spotted in 1997 and is known as a 'quasi-orbital satellite'

"The terrorist death cult Islamic State has reportedly found a new senior Australian jihadi recruiter after its highest-ranked Australian, Mohammed Ali Baryalei, was killed in October. The fighters have chosen Melbourne man Neil Prakash, who goes by the name of Abu Khaled al-Cambodi, as former Sydney bouncer Baryalei’s brainwashing successor, the Daily Telegraph reports. Al-Cambodi, who previously appeared in jihadist propaganda videos on YouTube, has been using his Twitter and Ask.fm accounts to answer questions about IS. ‘Worry what Allah is planning,’ the Fijian and Cambodian man reportedly instructed nonbelievers. Scroll down for video . Melbourne man Neil Prakash goes by the name of Abu Khaled al-Cambodi. He is reportedly trying to recruit more Australians to join ISIS . Al-Cambodi previously appeared in jihadist propaganda videos on YouTube (right) Al-Cambodi’s Twitter page frequently describes Islamic State activities in real time, including the capturing of an air base, and encourages others to join the extremist group. 'Heavy Clashes in tabqa, fireworks is the agenda tonight! Please done forget the brothers in your duas (prayers)! [sic]' he previously posted. Baryalei is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East. After his death was reported on social media in October his mother and a senior defence force member claimed they believed he was still alive. Baryalei left Australia in 2013 to go to Syria and a warrant was put out for his arrest in September as it emerged he was recruiting fighters to the Islamic State's cause. Mr Baryalei worked with the Street Dawah movement, a group of Muslims who recruited on the streets of western Sydney . Vice Admiral David Johnston says he has seen no information to confirm social media reports the Australian was killed . Defence force chief of joint operations Vice Admiral David Johnston said he has seen no information to confirm social media reports the Australian was killed in Syria. 'Increasingly, it looks less likely than likely,' he told reporters. 'I have not seen anything to indicate, on balance, that he is dead.' His phone calls to Australia, allegedly regarding a plot to behead a random member of the public, sparked the largest anti-terrorism raids in the country's history, which targeted 25 homes in NSW and Queensland. A social media report at the end of October said Baryalei had been martyred, although it gave no details, and the Australian government was unable to confirm the reports. Vice Admiral Johnston said he has seen reports indicating a number of IS leaders have been targeted in air strikes, and there is no doubt that is having an impact on their leadership capability. Mr Baryalei, who left Australia in 2013 to go to Syria, was the highest-ranked Australian in the Islamic State jihadist group . A social media report at the end of October said Baryalei had been martyred . The Baryalei family arrived in Australia more than 30 years ago as refugees from Afghanistan. Unbeknownst to his family, Baryalei chose to join terror group Jabhat al-Nusra then the Islamic State. During the September terror raids, Baryalei was named by police as the instigator behind a plot to behead a member of the public in an Australian city which was to be filmed with the victim draped in the Islamic State's black flag. He worked with the Street Dawah movement, a group of Muslims who recruited on the streets of western Sydney. The wanted terrorist is also said to have battled with mental illness growing up, suffering extensive bouts of depression which saw him confined to his room for days on end. He apparently suffered a traumatic childhood at the hands of his abusive father, and left home at just 17. The wanted terrorist (bottom centre) is also said to have battled with mental illness growing up .

"Darren Scott's victim became intimidated and scared by his moody behaviour and wide-eyed stare . A fantasist who slashed his wealthy friend repeatedly in the neck in a savage attack at the victim's luxury apartment is facing jail today. Psychology graduate Darren Scott, 26, launched the frenzied knife attack after cooking up a plan to con money out of his rich pal. He stabbed his victim three times in the neck and repeatedly on his body with a serrated kitchen knife in the master bedroom of the £2million home in Mayfair, central London. Scott screamed ‘stand still I need to finish the job’ as he tried to tear open the neck wounds with his fingers while angry rap music blared in the background. An Old Bailey jury today convicted him of attempted murder, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud, at the end of a three-week trial. During the horrific incident, the court heard, the victim, a writer who cannot be identified for legal reasons, fought back and managed to barricade himself in the en-suite bathroom while blood gushed from his throat. Undeterred, Scott tried to kick the door down to continue the attack, chillingly telling the man ‘you’re going to die’ before eventually fleeing the blood-soaked apartment. He had conned his way into the victims’ home just a day after they had met through social media, posing as an investment consultant for Procter and Gamble and pretending he had been kicked out of his own flat. Initially intrigued by Scott’s wide-eyed stare and moody demeanour, the victim soon became ‘intimidated’ and scared by his erratic behaviour. Scott, whose adopted parents live in Immingham, near Grimsby, had confessed to enjoying kinky bondage games with handcuffs and rope that he carried around with him. The victim had resolved to kick Scott out of the apartment the night before the attack, after seeing him angrily chopping potatoes. But Scott launched the terrifying knife attack while giving the victim a friendly massage in the bedroom the next morning. Scott chillingly told his victim ‘you’re going to die’ before eventually fleeing the blood-soaked apartment . He broke down in tears and sobbed into his hands as the verdicts were read out in court today. Scott will be sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court next month. Scott, who has a first-class honours degree in psychology from the University of Hull, launched the bloody assault on July 3 last year, less than two weeks after he and the victim had first met. Scott had tapped his neck ‘like a nurse looking for a vein’ just moments before the stabbing . When he was arrested at a jazz club in Hull the following day, police discovered Scott had taken thousands of photos in the time he had been living in the Mayfair apartment. Text messages show he had been passing the luxury pad off as his own to pals, boasting about his ‘insane’ penthouse in Mayfair with a fully-stocked wine cellar. He had been on spending sprees with his victim’s credit card, including £1,700 at House of Fraser and a first-class train ticket to Hull. Scott had also sketched plans of the apartment, photographed the digital entry keypad on the front door, and researched online how to disable the alarms. Among his possessions was a bogus court compensation order for £420,000, forged bank statements, and a fake job offer from Procter and Gamble. Prosecutor John Clifford said the bedroom of the apartment was left ‘like something out of a horror movie’ after Scott’s attack. The victim, coming face to face with Scott for the first time since the attack, gave detailed evidence about how a ‘possessed’ Scott tried to kill him. He said Scott massaged him for around 40 minutes with soothing music playing on his iPhone, before going to the kitchen to get some salt water. When he returned, Scott told him to roll on to his back and he lay a rolled up vest over his eyes. ‘The music had turned to rap music’, he told jurors. ‘A certain kind of rap music that I was not familiar with.’ Scott then plunged the kitchen knife into his neck, stabbed him repeatedly during a violent struggle in the bedroom. Scott broke down in tears and sobbed into his hands as the verdict was read out at the Old Bailey . ‘I was sure that I had been murdered and I had a very short time to live’, he said. ‘The only thought I had in my mind was why I had been so patient, and that I had a gut feeling - an uncomfortable gut feeling - and I had been too patient. ‘I was now dying because I had been murdered, these are the last minutes of my life and this is how my life has come to an end.’ He continued: ‘Darren was like a possessed, vicious man who was staring in my eyes, telling me: “What did you think this was all about - stand still I need to finish the job”’, he said. ‘When Darren first moved to strike, I think he made a sound. ‘I can’t remember if these sounds are in my head or I heard them. A street in plush Mayfair, where Scott had been staying in the victim's £2million apartment when he launched the frenzied knife attack . ‘Darren was using his left hand, trying to put his fingers into my neck wounds and rip them open them with his hand as he was striking with the other one and I was shouting “murder”.’ The victim said he resorted to grabbing the blade of the knife to stop the attack, and managed to struggle free and lock himself in the bathroom. He said Scott had tapped his neck ‘like a nurse looking for a vein’ just moments before the stabbing, then pinned his arms to the bed. ‘In a flash, Darren’s body moved and as soon as his body moved I turned myself away from Darren’s right’, he said. ‘I managed to throw Darren off my body and the next thing I remember I was fighting off the knife in the middle of the room. ‘Darren stabbed me repeatedly around the same area of my neck. ‘I fought with my arms and kept Darren off me.’ He said Scott had earlier confessed to tying up a previous partner with rope and handcuffs during massages. ‘He said he used to tie them up with a rope which had handcuffs at the end’, he said. ‘The rope would go under the bed and come up the other side and tie the wrists. ‘He said he would massage his partner and then have sex with them.’ But he told jurors: ‘I’ve never been interested in activities like that’. Scott broke down crying after the attack, then fled, taking a train to Brough near Hull that evening. Bearing visible injuries, Scott told pals he had been the victim of an attack by potential investors who were trying to steal his art work. But when snared the next day while socialising at Jaz Cafe Bar in Lowgate, Hull, Scott’s web of lies was unravelled. He told his victim that he had been abused as a child and stabbed by his birth mother, had worked overseas in Iraq, and claimed his father was a wealthy North Sea oil worker. Scott, of no fixed address, denied attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud.","Darren Scott, 26, had plan to con money out of rich pal when he attacked .

"Moscow will continue to buzz Britain with its long-range bombers at the same intensity for the whole year, a top Kremlin commander has made clear. Recent weeks have twice seen RAF Typhoon fighter jets scrambled to escort Russian Bear bombers as they flew close to British airspace, but there will be no let-up. General-lieutenant Anatoly Zhikharev, commander of Russian long distance military aviation, has made clear in comments not previously reported in the West that the bomber flights will remain at a high level throughout 2015. Scroll down for video . General-lieutenant Anatoly Zhikharev, commander of Russian long distance military aviation, insists bomber flights near to British airspace will remain at a high level throughout 2015 . 'According to the plan of strategic deterrence, the flights of long distance aviation will be continued as a part of military training and with the same intensity,' he is on record as saying. This would apply not only to flights in the eastern Atlantic, but also over the Arctic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, he stressed. Zhikharev said that in 2015, Russia will get six more upgraded Tu-160 strategic bomber planes, and the Tu-95MS will rise to 43. General-lieutenant Zhikharev, photographed alongside Russian President, Vladimir Putin . His words were echoed by the commander of the Russian air force, who hit back at Western press reports over the flights close to NATO borders. 'It is true that our long distance aviation airplanes are flying and will be flying to the remote geographic regions to the furthest allowed distance,' said Viktor Bondarev. 'It is necessary for training the crews and for keeping an eye on the capacity of the planes. 'All flights are performed in strict accordance with the international rules of air space usage - only over the neutral waters without entering the air space or breaking the borders of other countries. The military chief's comments come following two incidents in which Russian jets were escorted by RAF Typhoons after being caught flying near British airspace . 'According to the plan of strategic deterrence, the flights of long distance aviation will be continued as a part of military training and with the same intensity,'said General-lieutenant Zhikharev . 'At the same time, almost all the flights of our planes are accompanied by fighter planes of NATO countries or their partners whose aviation bases are located not far from the route of our aircraft. 'The intensity of NATO and US intelligence flights have increased since 2014, and the number of such flights above the Baltic and Barents seas is eight to 12 per week.' Retired general Pert Deinekin, formerly head of the Russian air force, even issued a taunt that 'the Brits have forgotten what we can do', referring to the frequency of flights in the Cold War, which have now returned. 'We have always performed at our best against those who instigate us to start a conflict,' he warned, using rhetoric redolent of the Soviet era when these 'behind the corner' flights - pilots' slang for a routing along the Scandinavian peninsula towards Britain - were common. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon last week said that the frequency of recent flights - such as those close to Cornwall and Dorset by Russian warplanes capable of carrying nuclear weapons - were on a scale not seen since the end of the Cold War. Since January last year, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included: . Wednesday: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall. Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel. Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth. Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland. Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne. Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland. Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain. He also branded Putin 'a very real and present danger' to Britain's allies in the Baltics. Russian TV station Zvezda, backed by the Defence Ministry in Moscow, released a video of British and French fighter jets escorting a Tu-95 bear earlier this week. The film was shot from inside the cockpit of the long range bomber. Russian military expert Viktor Litovkin told the same channel: 'We are not such nit-picking people. 'We do not make noise in press each time a NATO plane flies close to our borders or our aircraft when they are on a military mission. 'Something that is a routine matter for our pilots, for them turns into a reason for hysteria a la Cold War times.' Moscow claims that NATO countries are similarly drastically increasing their probing flights close to Russian territory. In 2014, NATO intelligence aviation performed more than 200 flights close to Russian borders, compared with 2013 when there were 125 flights. 'The devices on board of such planes allow investigation of the whole territory of Kaliningrad region,' said Bondarev, referring to Russia's exclave in the Baltic, between NATO countries Lithuania and Poland. 'The routes of these flights are very close to the Russian border and it allows to perform radio-electronic intelligence up to 500 kilometres deep into the territory and to follow the work schedule and characteristics of army management, anti-aircraft systems and aviation. 'The flights of US strategic intelligence RC-135 planes are made almost daily. Prime Minister David Cameron (left) dismissed last week's incident, saying the Russians 'are trying to make some sort of a point. He said that the action, authorised by Russian President Vladimir Putin (right), should not have been dignified 'with too much of a response' 'For example, in 2014 there were about 140 RC-135 flights, and in 2013 there were only 22.' Moscow's ambassador to London,Dr Alexander Yakovenko, this week echoed that view. He said: 'Military activity by Nato aircraft at Russian borders is far more intense, having doubled since early 2014, reaching 3,000 sorties that year. 'By way of comparison, Russian reconnaissance aircraft carried out just over 200 sorties over the Baltic Sea area from March to December 2014, compared with 125 over the same period in 2013. 'The growing disparity between the actual situation and the official rhetoric of some Western leaders is not helpful for restoring trust, which is probably the main victim of the crisis in relations between Russia and the West.' Last week, Air Chief Marshal Lord Stirrup, a former chief of the defence staff, said planes packed with holidaymakers could be brought down by Russian jets in a highly dangerous 'game of chicken'. Two Russian bombers last week skirted British airspace off the coast of Cornwall, where they were intercepted and escorted by two RAF Typhoon fighters. The two Typhoons, armed with air-to-air missiles, were launched from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire after the Russian bombers were spotted at 6.30pm on Wednesday. They were escorted as they flew south, then turned around and flew north past the Irish coast. Heavily armed: The video released earlier this week by a Kremlin-backed TV station showed the full arsenal of the Typhoon jet as it flies next to the bomber. The tail badge shows it comes from Lossiemouth . That incident came after one of the huge Cold War-era Tu-95 planes was spotted in the skies off the coast of Bournemouth last month. Lord Stirrup said the flights were not 'joy rides' but 'mission rehearsals' designed to test Britain's capability to react. Speaking on  Sky News's Murnaghan programme, he said: 'They are becoming more aggressive. 'These aircraft - Russian Bears for example - are not going on these very flights simply as joy rides. They are mission rehearsals. 'These aircraft launch stand-off missiles against Western targets and just as they used to do in the Cold War they are practising those profiles. 'They are testing us, they are testing our defences, they are testing our reactions and they are engaging to a degree in a game of chicken and that's very dangerous. 'So we are seeing the possibility of mid-air collision, not between RAF and Russia aircraft, but between Russian aircraft and civilian aircraft increasing.' Official figures show that RAF jets have been scrambled to deter Russian plans 88 times from 2005 to 2014, including 8 times last year. A third of all incidents in which RAF pilots were deployed involved a plan from Russia. Footage of British and French fighter jets escorting a Russian bomber were released by a Kremlin-backed TV station earlier this week. The video was filmed from the window of one of the huge Cold War-era Tu-95 planes. Prime Minister David Cameron defiantly dismissed the incident, saying the Russians 'are trying to make some sort of a point, and I don't think we should dignify it with too much of a response'. He added: 'I think what this episode demonstrates is that we do have the fast jets, the pilots, the systems in place to protect the UK.'","Military chief Anatoly Zhikharev says flights will continue throughout 2015 .

"Bravery: Lance Corporal Bruce Toge was awarded the Conspicuous Gallery Cross for saving five wounded comrades during a Taliban attack . A hero of the Afghan war who displayed 'superhuman' strength to rescue five wounded comrades while under fire from the Taliban is selling the medal he was awarded for £70,000. Lance Corporal Bruce Toge was knocked out when insurgents attacked his armoured vehicle with rocket-propelled grenades, but after he came to he immediately started saving his fellow soldiers. The brave soldier single-handedly carried five troops - all inexperienced members of the Afghan National Army - out of harm's way during the incident in 2008. He was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, the second highest award for valour after the Victoria Cross, for his 'raw courage and inspirational leadership.' But L/Cpl Toge, 29, has now left the Army, and is selling the medal to raise money so he can 'support his family' and start he own business. The soldier, who was originally from Fiji and now lives in Shropshire, was on his second tour of Afghanistan with the Royal Irish Regiment at the time of the attack. He was second in command of an eight-man British team that was supporting an Afghan National Army (ANA) dompany during the mission to secure high ground above a Taliban stronghold south of Musa Qaleh in Helmand Province. But when his commanding officer became incapacitated, L/Cpl Toge was forced to take control of the patrol. The company spent 90 minutes engaged in a firefight with the Taliban before orders came to advance while under heavy fire. Medal: The cross is the second highest award for valour, behind only the Victoria Cross . Scene: L/Cpl Toge's bravery came during a firefight near Musa Qaleh in southern Afghanistan, pictured . The Warrior vehicle he moved forward with suffered at least 10 strikes by a rocket-propelled grenade. L/Cpl Toge modestly wrote of the moment he rescued the five comrades injured in the attack. He said: 'I was out for about 10 seconds. 'They were screaming. One had a neck and shoulder injury. I knew I had to extract the casualties - that was my priority. So I went with the ANA medic - we crawled forward, got the guys, pulled them back and patched them up. 'We heaved them on to the back of the Warrior and then continued fighting. The adrenaline kicks in and you prioritise - casualty, objective then yourself. That's what I did. I didn't think about medals - I just thought it was another fight.' Mementoes: As well as the CGC, the decorated soldier is selling his dog tags and identity card . Sale: Auctioneer Richard Bromell, pictured, is selling the medal in Dorset next month . The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC) is the second highest military medal that can be awarded to members of the United Kingdom's armed forces. Presented in 'recognition of an act or acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations against the enemy', the medal was created in 1993 and can be awarded to all ranks of the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. It was introduced after a review of the honours system as part of a drive to remove distinctions of rank in awards for bravery, replacing both the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal, and can also be awarded posthumously. The CGC is silver and in the shape of a cross with a laurel wreath underneath, and is mounted on a white ribbon with blue and crimson stripes. A recipient's rank, name and unit are engraved on the reverse. Corporal Wayne Mills was the first recipient of the CGC, after he saved the lives of his patrol by single-handedly holding off a group of attackers which serving in Bosnia in 1994. Other recipients include Dipprasad Pun, a Nepalese corporal with the Royal Gurkha Rifles who was awarded the honour after he defeated up to 30 Taliban insurgents who were storming his control post in Helmand province in 2010. Three-time Boat Race winner and Army Captain Robin Bourne-Taylor was awarded the medal in 2010, while Royal Marine Mark Jackson ensured his receipt of the award was an extra-special day by proposing to his girlfriend Rebecca Daniel after the 2011 ceremony. L/Cpl Toge then led the rest of his troops to higher ground overlooking a Taliban-controlled village and started firing on the enemy before withdrawing to allow British air support to bomb the area. The citation for his CGC reads: 'Repeatedly, Toge exposed himself to fire disregarding his own safety to keep the ANA going forward. His gallant and inspirational leadership had every man following him. 'He single-handedly, with supreme strength and selflessness, extracted each one from the killing area and dealt with their treatment. 'Toge's actions were truly extraordinary; not least because he was, as a Lance Corporal, commanding a company group of indigenous forces in the most challenging and dangerous conditions, against a determined well equipped and brutal enemy. 'His raw courage, inspirational leadership, tactical acumen and almost superhuman strength are most deserving of official recognition of the highest order.' Military historian Richard Doherty said: 'Bruce Toge is a man of great character and imposing physical appearance. His actions on that day would have left the likes of Rambo and the Terminator in the shade.' L/Cpl Toge is selling the medals at Charterhouse Auctioneers of Sherborne in Dorset on March 19, along with his dog tags and . Auctioneer Richard Bromell said: 'The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross is awarded for an act or acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations against the enemy, being second only to a Victoria Cross. 'Having been instituted in 1993, only 60 CGCs to date have been awarded so they rarely appear on the market, and it is therefore a great honour to be instructed to sell such an important medal by the recipient.'","Lance Corporal Bruce Toge came under fire during 2008 tour of Helmand .

"Google has vowed to crack down on bloggers who post porn, telling them that their posts will be hidden from view if they don’t clean up their act. People who publish material on the company’s Blogger platform now have just one month to remove any explicit photographs and videos. After March 23, Google will make any offensive accounts ‘private’, effectively making them impossible to view by anyone other than the account holder. Google has announced changes to its Blogger platform banning graphic images from public view . Blogs created after the deadline may also be taken down. Google used to only ban content that was illegal, or had been published without the consent of the people it featured. But it now says explicit photographs will have to be justifiable on ‘artistic, educational, documentary, or scientific grounds’. Google changed its rules following a Daily Mail campaign to get firms to take more responsibility for the content published on their websites. Earlier this month, it emerged that porn actors and publishers are using Twitter to get past family-friendly online filters, putting explicit images within reach of children. Google changed its policy following a campaign by the Daily Mail for it to take more responsibility for content . A study found that 500,000 graphic images and videos are published on the site every day, but Twitter has so far refused to address the problem. Separately, Reddit said in its updated privacy terms Tuesday it would ban 'involuntary pornography' or 'revenge porn' starting March 10. According to the company: 'If you believe that someone has submitted, without your permission, to Reddit a link to a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, please contact us... and we will expedite its removal as quickly as possible. Reddit prohibits the posting of such content without consent.' The move comes after Reddit gained notoriety for hosting forums used to post nude pictures hacked from other online accounts in 2014. That included pictures of celebrities including actress Jennifer Lawrence, pop icon Rihanna and top model Kate Upton. 'Last year, we missed a chance to be a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy. 'No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on Reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on Reddit.' Reddit was also criticised for allowing users to post pictures of underage girls, before shutting down forums used for that purpose. Reddit three years ago banned child pornography and posting of sexually suggestive material involving minors.","Explicit blogs will have to be removed from Google by March 23 .

Mr Kronfield has created a prototype and is currently running a Kickstarter campaign to create a commercial mode. According to the Kickstarter campaign: 'The system provides variable resistance, based on programmable or pre-set workout profiles, and GPS terrain-sensing virtual hills, all with torque amplified pedalling'. It is estimated the price of the Raht Racer will start at $35,000 (£22,800) if the campaign is successful. The vehicle senses the torque being applied to the pedals, and then amplifies it so that most people can maintain a cruising speed of around 30 mph (48 km/h) The body of the two-seater Raht Racer is made from carbon fiber and includes a roll cage, headlights, seat lights, air bags and a trunk .

"They haven't always enjoyed the kindest of press but that wasn't enough to stop the Duchess of Cornwall from spending the afternoon touring a newsroom. But this was far from being your average Fleet Street outfit. Instead, Camilla was at First News - the world's largest paper for children. Dressed in a tailored brown suit by Bruce Oldfield, the Duchess was all smiles as she toured the newsroom, shaking hands with editorial staff and budding journalists alike. Grand opening: The Duchess of Cornwall opened the new offices of children's newspaper, First News . Among them was Chloe Miller, 11, who was trying her hand at reporting, and her colleague - budding photographer Kai Patel, also 11. As the duchess was introduced to the newspaper's staff Kai snapped away like a seasoned professional, while Chloe questioned her in a way that would have done Jeremy Paxman proud. Camilla, who is patron of the National Literacy Trust, features in the next issue of First News, in which she answers questions on her reading habits. Chloe, 11, from Stanmore in north  London, said: 'She wanted me to choose a photo of her for First News and then she said that if she could be any book character she would be Winnie the Pooh. 'I asked her why and she said she would love to have her fingers stuck in honey. I thought that was a good excuse.' Kai, from Stanwell Moor, Surrey, said he only discovered he was going to be taking photographs of a member of the royal family when a camera was thrust into his hands this morning - his very first day. Looking good: Camilla was on glamorous form in a brown Bruce Oldfield suit and her trademark pearls . Well done: The Duchess, who was flanked by budding reporter Chloe Miller, 11, appeared to enjoy the visit . He said: 'It has been been a real honour to meet the Duchess of Cornwall. She is just like everyone else and was talking to me like an adult in a normal way.' After meeting the newspaper staff Camilla was told about the work of Children United - and she was given a taste of how it will work when she took part in a Skype session between children at the First News office and a group of school children in Uganda, who sang for the duchess. Available as a printed paper in the UK and digitally abroad, First News has more than two million young readers and has racked up a number of awards for its contribution to children's issues. Among them is Children United, an interactive web-based communication platform that is freely available to children across the world. Impressive: Also on hand to greet the Duchess was 11-year-old Kai Patel - a would-be photographer . On deadline! Camilla shared a joke with 11-year-old Chloe Miller during the tour of the newspaper's offices . When Camilla arrived, the young reporters were using the tool to chat with their counterparts in Uganda - one of the many countries to benefit from the technology. It was all a far cry from the Duchess' first visit of the day which, with Prince Charles, had been to the offices of this newspaper in London's Kensington. The royal couple were touring the Evening Standard, which shares the building with MailOnline, and met the paper's editorial staff and its owner, Evgeny Lebedev. Charles also shared a joke with the newspaper's royal editor Robert Jobson as he and the duchess posed for a photo in front of an Evening Standard banner, quipping 'cheap publicity!' as he obliged. Nevertheless, the heir to the throne still managed to make an impression, with football columnist Patrick Barclay describing him as an 'absolute hero'. 'He is my absolute hero in this country,' he said. 'At the risk of sounding like a footballer in a cup final, this is a dream come true meeting this gentleman.' Real deal: Earlier, Charles was at Northcliffe House - the headquarters of London's Evening Standard .

"Unidentified drones have been spotted flying above Paris for a second night, after 'at least' five were spotted illegally flying around city landmarks on Monday, sparking a terror alert. Drones were seen on Monday buzzing the Eiffel Tower, Bastille Square and the U.S. embassy building. Unmanned aircraft were also spotted flying overnight on Monday near the French capital's Place de la Concorde and the Invalides military museum, where Napoleon Bonaparte is buried. French security sources where unable to catch the operators of the drones, which are typically fitted with video recording equipment and can be used for surveillance of a terror target to assess security levels and any spikes in pedestrian footfall ahead of a planned attack. Fear: Drones were spotted flying near the Invalides military museum, where Napoleon Bonaparte is buried . Alert: Paris is on alert for a new terror attack after 'at least' five drones were spotted illegally flying around city landmarks, including the  the U.S. embassy building (pictured) Tension: Drones were also seen flying around the world-famous Eiffel Tower . New threat: French law bans small, civilian drones from areas such as nuclear facilities, which are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 1.6-mile radius and a height of 1,000 metres. The above drone crashed on the grass near the White House in the United States last month . A map showing where the drones have been sighted in Paris . The first drone sighting was near the US embassy in the French capital at around midnight on Monday. Between then and 6am the Eiffel Tower, Bastille Square, the Place de la Concorde and the Invalides military museum 'were also flown over' , a security source said. 'It could be a coordinated action but we don't know for now,' the source, who asked not to be identified, added. 'We did everything to try and catch the operators but they were not found,' another source close to the investigation said. France has experienced a series of mysterious drone appearances in the last few months. On January 20, a pilotless aircraft briefly went over the presidential palace in Paris, while around 20 drones were earlier seen flying above nuclear power plants. However until Tuesday 'there have never been so many drones appearing in one night,' the security source said. Location: At some point between midnight and 6am on Monday, drone aircraft were spotted flying near Bastille Square . Tourist hotspot: The first drone sighting in the French capital was around midnight on Monday. Shortly after an unmanned aircraft was seen flying near the Place de la Concorde . The emergence of drones comes amid warnings by terrorist groups that they will attack the city, following January shootings which left a total of 20 dead, including three terrorists. ‘They could be seen throughout the night, but nobody knows who were operating them,’ said a police source in the capital. A specialist police aviation unit tried to establish who was at the controls, but there have been no arrests. There have been other mysterious drone flights across Paris, but this is the first time that such a concentrated number have been seen above so many potentially vulnerable targets. The US embassy has been threatened by numerous groups in the past, from Al-Qaeda to Algeria’s Armed Islamic Group. French law bans small, civilian drones from areas such as nuclear facilities, which are protected by a no-fly zone that spans a 1.6-mile radius and a height of 1,000 metres. Experts say that the small unmanned craft would not pose a threat if crashed into a hardened nuclear facility. Fightback: Earlier this month France unveiled its latest weapon against the growing menace of rogue drones buzzing through their nation's skies: another drone, with a net . Caught: In a demonstration in La Queue-en-Brie, east of Paris, the mesh-wielding flying machine was shown snaring a DJI Phantom 2 drone - the same brand as one which crashed onto the White House lawn last month . France has barred six 'would-be jihadists' from leaving the country after discovering their plans to travel to Syria and join the Islamic State terror group. It the first such travel ban under a new law aimed at preventing French Islamic radicals travelling to the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq currently under the control of Sunni extremists. French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve says some 40 other French citizens will face travel bans in the coming weeks. He did not reveal the identity of the six people whose passports have already been confiscated. The bans are the first since a sweeping anti-terrorism law passed in France last year. The government is especially worried since attacks in Paris last month killed 20 people, including three gunmen claiming ties to Islamic extremists in Syria and Yemen. An Interior Ministry official says the passports and ID cards of the six have been declared invalid for six months - a measure that can be extended for up to two years. The news comes just days after Cazeneuve said he asked Google, Facebook and Twitter to work directly with French officials during investigations and to immediately remove terrorist propaganda when authorities alert them to it. Earlier this month France unveiled its latest weapon against the growing menace of rogue drones buzzing through their nation's skies: another drone, with a net. In a demonstration flight in La Queue-en-Brie, east of Paris, the mesh-wielding flying machine was shown snaring a DJI Phantom 2 drone - the same brand as one which crashed onto the White House lawn last month. The U.S. Secret Service was sent scrambling by the unexpected intrusion, but France has already faced dozens of drone overflights over sensitive sites. Mystery drones have buzzed nuclear plants, military installations and even the presidential palace in recent months, as fears run high of terror attacks linked to the Islamic State terror group. Concerned at the new technology, officials have asked scientists and companies to develop ways to monitor and detect intruding drones and their remote-control pilots; analyse and track their flight paths; and ultimately neutralise the drones, either temporarily or permanently, with the least collateral damage possible. Last October it emerged that holidaymakers who are planning to fly a camera-equipped drone in Paris’ tourist zones risk spending time in jail and being slapped with a hefty fine. An Israeli tourist found out the hard way this week when he was arrested in front of Notre Dame Cathedral while flying a drone above some of Paris’ top attractions.","Unmanned aircraft were seen flying over tourist hotspots in French capital .

"A very special therapy dog bringing joy to hospital patients around Melbourne is proving that a dog certainly is man's best friend. Ralf the Giant Schnauzer was adopted  in 2005 by the Lovick family, who quickly realised that their new dog was much more than just a pet. The gentle giant has been visiting sick children and aged-care homes for nearly ten years, bringing his special brand of magic to the people who need it most. The Lovick family adopted Ralf in 2005- from top left: Caroline, Alice, Rebecca, Sam, Ralf, Imogen, Edward and Ivy (Ralf's daughter) 'Everybody knows what it feels like to have a bad day. Ralf is happy to be your friend and have a hug. He thinks you’re beautiful and perfect exactly the way you are,' Ralf's owner Caroline Lovick, told Daily Mail Australia. The Lovick's often have to remind themselves that their beloved family member is a dog, as he behaves in a way that is more human than they could have ever expected. 'He looks at you and replies even though he hasn't said a thing. He's a very perceptive dog and loves watching Australia's Funniest Home Videos and scenes from Frozen,' Caroline said. Ralf's special talents were first spotted when Caroline and her family took the Giant Schnauzer to compete at the Royal Melbourne Show in 2005 and a small girl with Asperger's Syndrome rushed over to pat him. 'Ralf melted like a marshmallow,' Caroline said in 'Ralf', the newly released biography of his extraordinary life. One of the organisers of the show relayed the incident to a representative from Dog's Victoria, which runs programs to train dogs to be therapy animals. RALF by Anne Crawford, published by Allen & Unwin, RRP $29.99, is on sale 25th February . Zeke Harrison with Ralf in the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne . Zeke met the Ralf while he was in the Intensive Care Unit for a rare condition which turns protein in toxins . Caroline, along with her husband Sam, are passionate about volunteering, and jumped at the chance to give back to the community through the talents of their beloved family member. Ralf quickly became a reguar visitor at the Trinity Manor family owned aged care home in Melbourne, visiting the residents for up to six hours each week and bringing a smile to the faces of many who lived there. 'When Ralf came in he brought an element of magic. He helped us see the best in people, helped us see them come out from the shadow of dementia,' said Jessie Bainbridge, the Lifestyle Co-ordinator of Trinity Manor. 'He really made a difference to people’s lives,' she said. Ralf visited the residents in common areas, in their rooms, even in the centre's hair salon, offering companionship and quiet solace and even sparking memories in some of the patients suffering from dementia. Caroline said the way that Ralf interacted with the residents was all the reward she needed. ‘I wish I could bottle those moments,' she said in the biography. Summer Wilson with her parents, Samantha Brew and Chris Wilson in March 2014 . Samantha and her mother met Ralf while she was in the Intensive Care Unit of the Royal Children's Hospital . After six and a half years visiting the manor and building friendships with the staff and residents, Caroline and Ralf decided it was time to move on. When a friend suggested that the gentle giant might be a good therapy dog for the Melbourne Royal Children’s Hospital, Caroline and Ralf began visiting every second Friday. Ralf became a hit at the hospital, and parents began requesting appointments on Fridays so that they could tell their child that they were going to see Ralf. Caroline said that Ralf fell in love with all the children and that it gave her so much joy to see him working and playing with them. Ralf already had experience with 'children', as he was the father of Ivy, another Giant Schnauzer who he fathered with his 'wife' Lulu. 'He particularly loves babies, and he'll go down on all fours to make himself smaller than the child so that they're not afraid of him,' she said. ‘I think now, “I’ll do anything to make your child smile, to make you smile, to make your life a bit better"",' Caroline said in the book. One child who had a special bond with Ralf was Zeke Harrison, who met the therapy dog while he was in the Intensive Care Unit for a MSUD, a rare condition which turns protein in toxins. Summer in the hospital after she had her heart transplant when her organs began filling with liquid . Ralf with Summer. He loves children...and ice cream! Zeke had been in and out of hospital since he was only a few days old, and had been hospitalised 28 times since his first birthday, causing great distress to his parents. The 15-month-old was in the RMCH with a virus, and instantly brightened when the shaggy black Schnauzer arrived at his bedside. 'It just made him so much happier...I was happy to see his little smile. And Ralf's adorable,' said Jazmin Hall, Zeke's mum. A photograph snapped of the toddler walking alongside his huge furry friend quickly made the rounds in both local and international media, shooting Ralf to fame and raising awareness of the work that the RMCH does. Summer Wilson, a five-year-old who had been suffering from an undiagnosed illness which caused liquid to pool in her vital organs, also created a special bond with Ralf. Two days before a scheduled heart transplant, Ralf was at the hospital for a visit, and provided some much needed relief for her parents Samantha and Chris. ‘Before Ralf came, nothing positive had happened, everything was bad…Seeing the joy on Summer’s face made us forget what was going on, it was like a little breakthrough. It was like hope,' Samantha said in the biography. Two-and-a-half year old Claire Couwenberg had been a series of medical tests and treatments since doctors had found a cancerous growth the size of a football on her kidney. Claire Couwenberg met Ralf in the ICU and was reunited with him two years after he helped her walk again . The formerly lively young girl was refusing to walk or even move from her wheelchair, and her mother Marie was delighted when Ralf transformed her attitude when he offered himself for a walk. 'She was so determined to walk with Ralf. Nothing else mattered to her- for a moment it was like she wasn't even sick. It made me so happy,' Marie said in the biography. Claire's parents attribute the speed of Claire's recovery to Ralf, and said that the meeting gave them renewed hope. 'If you can make someone smile at a low point in their life then that is wonderful. It’s like a gift, like someone giving you a beautiful present, and I get to watch and witness little bits of happiness every time Ralf and I visit,' Caroline said. Ralf turns 11 this year, which is 'ancient in Giant Schnauzer years', and suffered his own health scare when he was diagnosed with arthritis and cancer in his toe. Caroline said that while she knows Ralf won't be around forever, she has treasured the moments she has shared with him and the people they have met, and is incredibly proud of the work ralf has done. ‘I feel completely spoilt and privileged that I go to work with Ralf- I’ve loved every minute of it,' Caroline said. 'It’s a little window, a nugget and it’s not going to last forever. I feel so incredibly lucky to have Ralf in the world’.

"The website that became ground zero for the nude photos hacking scandal has announced a ban on all naked or sexual images posted without consent. Reddit, the sprawling, user-run forum site which brands itself 'the front page of the internet', will impose the ban next month. It comes months after the site was criticized for openly directing users to pornographic hacked images of the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton on a dedicated page set up to spread them. Victims: Kate Upton, left, and Jennifer Lawrence, were the highest-profile victims of the nude hacking scandal, images from which Reddit allowed on its forums. Lawrence in particular hit back against everyone who shared, viewed and hosted the pictures, saying they were complicit in a 'sex crime' against her . 'Front page of the internet': Reddit, shown above, has 160million users and a history of lax policing on its site. It admitted that it 'missed the chance' to act when the photos first leaked . While the company eventually closed the section down, thousands of people had already accessed the images, generating huge ad revenues for Reddit in the process. Under the new rules, effective from March 10, all images of any person either naked, aroused or having sex which are posted by the site's 160million users without consent are banned. Anything which is posted will be removed, Reddit said, and potential victims were given a contact address to flag any banned posts. Previous rules had banned only child pornography, and content perceived to be spam - though volunteer moderators could also remove items if they chose. In a post signed by Reddit's interim CEO Ellen Pao, she acknowledged that the site 'missed the chance' to act decisively while the nude photos leaks was happening. Caught in the trap: Kirsten Dunset, left, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, right, were also pictured naked in the stolen photographs . She said: 'No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on reddit.' The photo leak drew a furious reaction from the celebrities featured, many of whom confirmed that the images were legitimate. Lawrence in particular was strident in her criticism of the leaks, which began last August. She said anybody involved in spreading the pictures was complicit in a 'sex crime' against her and should 'cower in shame'. It comes at the same time as Google announced its Blogger service would also enact a blanket ban on all pornographic posts later this month. New policy: Interim Reddit CEO Ellan Pao, left, announced the policy change. She is pictured above at a California courthouse, where she is suing former employers . From March 23, any sexually explicit or 'graphic nude' images will be removed from public view, and the account owners will find their sites switched to a invite-only mode. Nude pictures which are 'artistic, educational, documentary, or scientific contexts' will not be included in the ban. Social media sites have varying policies on nudity. Facebook prohibits images containing nudity altogether, which has enraged some mothers banned from sharing pictures of them breastfeeding their children. Twitter doesn't mediate legal content but recommends that content with nudity or violence be marked as sensitive. It also lets users flag questionable content for review.","Forum site, which has 160million users, will impose ban from March 10 .

"Historic photos show child who are now in their 80s enjoying pony rides and Tilt-A-Whirls during the heyday of a forgotten Los Angeles theme park. The amusement park historian Jay Jennings's Beverly Park: L.A.'s Kiddieland details the history of the attraction, which was open from 1945 to 1974 on the land that now houses the Beverly Center mall. It was owned by Dave Bradley,  a ride inventor and amusement park innovator, who filled the location with a Little Dipper roller coaster, Boat Ride, Merry-Go-Round, Helicopter Ride, Ferris Wheel, and a Haunted Castle long before Disneyland. The photos can also be seen on Retro Image Publishing. Scroll down for video . Millions of children (pictured, in 1972) who grew up in Los Angeles have memories of riding the ponies at Beverly Park, which was open from 1945 to 1974. The children who enjoyed Kiddieland in their youth are now up to 70 years older and now likely have grandchildren who would like the park . Dave Bradley gave a personal touch to the rides at his park, using his own voice for a talking hippopotamus . 'Millions of kids just like me thought Beverly Park was the greatest place on earth,' Mr Jennings told LAist. Bradley bought the park, which had been a baseball field before it became an amusement park in 1943, and made it his own. The man injected his own personal magic touch into childrens' experiences there, using his own voice as that of a blue hippopotamus who spoke to passersby. The site, which had free parking and was dubbed Kiddieland by parents, was also located next to Ponyland, where children could ride the small horses around a track. Bradley and his relatives ran the park as a family, and Hollywood stars of the era such as Lana Turner, Carol Burnett, Errol Flynn and other luminaries of the age took their children there, according to KCET. The park in western Los Angeles was popular with the stars of Hollywood and their children during the 30 years it was open . Walt Disney used to visit the park with his children and talk to Bradley about the rides that he had brought in . The park, on La Cienega Boulevard, treated guests to cotton candy and hot dogs sold in a stand that looked like its product . Rides included a Little Dipper roller coaster, Boat Ride, Merry-Go-Round, Helicopter Ride, Ferris Wheel, and a Haunted Castle . It was particularly popular with divorced Beverly Hills fathers looking to spoil their kids. Walt Disney, who opened his own park in 1955, was one of the early visitors to take his children to Kiddieland and talked to Bradley about the rides. He later recruited the park owner to join his Disneyland operation. The entrepreneur worked as a consultant for Disney at the same time as running the park, and would go to Europe to take pictures of interesting amusement park rides. 'In the end, Disney utilized many of Dave Bradley's ideas for Disneyland, such as the concept of ""themed photos ops"" where certain parts of the park could be specifically designed for taking family photos,' Jennings said. A rising lease price for the land would ultimately lead Kiddieland to close, and the first mall was built at the location in 1982. Bradley then concentrated on his carousel-molding business in Long Beach. Kiddieland was located next to the appropriately-named Ponyland, where children could ride ponies around a track . Bradley was recruited by Walt Disney to help with Disneyland, but continued running his own park at the same time . Beverly Park was particularly popular with divorced Beverly Hills dads who would spoil their kids with treats and fun . Kiddieland was closed in 1974 because of rising lease rates, and the place where it stood is now occupied by a mall called Beverly Center .","Beverly Park, also known as Kiddieland, was in west LA from 1945 to 1974 .

"The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has told the Mexican government to provide the necessary medical attention to a jailed vigilante leader who holds dual U.S. and Mexican citizenship. The Washington-based body wrote in a January 28 decision that it found adequate reason to be concerned for the health of 41-year-old Nestora Salgado, a resident of the Seattle suburb of Renton. Salgado was arrested in August 2013 after people detained by the community self-defense force she leads in the southern state of Guerrero alleged they had been kidnapped. A federal judge cleared Salgado of those charges last year, but related state charges have kept her locked up. Jailed: Nestora Salgado, who has been detained since she was arrested Aug 2013 in the state of Guerrero, south of Mexico City, where she had been leading a vigilante group targeting police corruption and drug cartel violence . Salgado's fellow commanders said during a news conference in Mexico City that the force in the town of Olinala never demanded bail money, which her accusers called ransom. The commanders said many of those detained were youths held at the request of their parents for 're-education.' 'The communitarian system does not request any bail,' said regional community police commander Cruz Morales Reyes. 'It does not request any ransom. There is no amount of money that can get someone out.' A state law allows Olinala and Guerrero's other indigenous communities to organize their own police forces. In need: The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has told the Mexican government to provide the necessary medical attention to the jailed vigilante leader who holds dual U.S. and Mexican citizenship . Borderline case: The case is drawing attention in Seattle as demonstrators demanded Salgado’s release over the weekend . Morales said the community police, which rose up as a result of corruption within the local government and organized crime, arrests people accused of crimes but also young people whose parents deem them out of control. One of those was Francisco Flores Jimenez, who said his mother asked that he be held and 're-educated' by the community police. He described a regimen of manual labor and lessons about the value of hard work. He said detainees who worked hard were fed well, while those who didn't received whatever was available. Flores also questioned charges by some detainees that they were abused. 'In my case, I was never mistreated,' he said. Giovani Torres, a group level community police commander, said Nestora Salgado was among the citizens who rose up against the criminality in Olinala. She distinguished herself through her bravery and was elected as a commander by an assembly of community police members, Torres said. Salgado grew up in Olinala and moved to the U.S. when she was about 20. Eventually she began making regular visits back to her hometown. 'The government knows perfectly well that all of the charges they're accusing Nestora of are false,' said her sister Cleotilde Salgado Garcia.","Nestora Salgado is a Mexican-born woman who arrived in the U.S. at age 20 .

"For James Williamson, now 67, life got off to a bad start. The sixth child of a feckless mother, he was handed over to a childless couple in East London 'like a UPS parcel'. Although his adoptive mother was kind to him, his scaffolder father was abusive and inflicted eye-watering violence on the child, even, on one occasion, attempting to stab him. But all that paled in comparison with what came next. Aged nine, Mr Williamson fell victim to a predatory paedophile. Survivor: James Williamson, now 67, suffered years of vile sexual abuse at the hands of his Scoutmaster . In many ways, Mr Williamson's childhood was typical of the East End at the time. 'If you watch Call the Midwife, that sums up what it was like,' he explains. 'We lived in Violet Row which started in Whitechapel and ended in Poplar - that was my environment. Handed over: His feckless mother handed him over to his adoptive parents 'like a UPS parcel' 'We had a shared house with outside toilet. Two families lived in it, one upstairs and one downstairs. There was no bath or shower so I was washed down in the kitchen sink.' The sixth child of a dozen born to a feckless woman called Ellen, he was handed over to a couple named Ivy and Jim for adoption as a baby. It was not a loving upbringing. 'My adoptive mother was always working and my father did too,' he remembers. 'I can remember a child minder called Mrs Edmonds and the house always being very quiet.' Although Ivy was kind, his adoptive father, a man with 'an unpredictable and violent temper', would often terrify him with his rages. 'I didn't love him and I don't think he loved me,' says Mr Williamson. But for all that, he says he did at least put food on the table. 'Whatever he was, whatever he did, he always put food on the table,' he explains. 'I always had clothes. Lots of kids in the East End didn't even have that.' Nevertheless, his childhood was a lonely one and Mr Williamson says he was 'a latchkey kid' - free to come and go as he pleased. But while such freedom was not unusual, it proved to have devastating consequences, when, at the age of nine, Mr Williamson fell prey to a child molester. 'I remember I liked war films as a kid,' he says. 'So one day, I decided I wanted to go and see a film called The Battle of the River Plate. Difficult: James with his adoptive parents Ivy and Jim. Jim had a 'violent and unpredictable' temper . 'I went in and the film was rolling. But the next thing I knew, this guy had come and sat next to me. I was wearing shorts. He had his hand on my knee and it went on from there.' When he left the cinema, the man followed. Unsuspecting, the trusting little boy allowed himself to be led into a nearby storeroom - and a horrific sex attack ensued. 'I was inquisitive and followed him in there like a little sheep,' he says ruefully. 'I could have been a headstone by now. That's how it could have ended.' Luckily, Mr Williamson was allowed to go. He ran home and kept what had happened to him secret, never telling anyone what had taken place. Lonely existence: James as a toddler. He says he spent much of his early years with a child minder . 'At the time, I thought: ""What was that? I can't tell anyone"". I knew it was wrong.' Heartbreakingly, he was also convinced that should his parents find out, they might blame him instead. 'What I was most concerned about was that if I told my parents, they might be angry and maybe put me in a home. 'I thought they might think they'd adopted a duff one. So I just carried on and a year later, I joined the Scouts.' His decision to join the Scouts was to prove a fateful one and what came next left him with mental scars that have lasted all his life. 'The first thing I thought when I saw him was that he was smart,' says Mr Williamson of the moment he was introduced to his Scoutmaster, a man named Tom. 'He was well-presented. His trousers had real nice creases on the front. He came to the meeting because our Scoutmaster was leaving. 'In the end, it was announced that Skip [former Scoutmaster] was going and Tom would be taking over. I didn't think he was good looking because he wasn't.' The meeting, when Mr Williamson was aged 10, signalled the start of what would turn into almost a decade of sexual abuse. Showered with attention and affection, the lonely little boy was easily groomed and, when Tom offered to take him to the cinema and said he could stay the night afterwards, the relationship became a sexual one. Unable to tell anyone, in particular his parents, Mr Williamson felt trapped and unable to sound the alarm. Even today, he is unwilling to condemn his attacker and calls what passed between them 'conditional kindness'. 'My father had a violent and unpredictable temper and Tom's place was a place of tranquillity and safety,' he explains. 'I felt that I was being offered something - a trade. I called it conditional kindness.' Heartbreakingly, he still feels disloyal by talking about what transpired between him and Tom. 'I sort of feel that I'm betraying someone who helped me,' he admits. 'There's a sort of mixed feeling. I also feel disloyal in some way.' Escape finally came when he left the Scouts aged 18, although he reveals he had tried to escape Tom's attentions many times before. Scout: James aged 10, proudly wearing a poppy and his Robertson's Jam Boy Scout Golly . 'I kept trying to get away,' he says. 'But he [Tom] would say things like, ""How do you feel about going to Belgium?"" and I'd think, ""Wow, me an East End boy in Belgium!"" And then I'd be right back in it again. I did try.' Aged 16, he met his first girlfriend and, determined to make it work, he tried again to make a break with his paedophile Scoutmaster. 'I tried so hard to make that break,' he says. 'In the end, I was too old for him. We became sort of friends.' He went on to marry his girlfriend and together, they had one child. But the marriage broke down when his daughter was a few months old. Mr Williamson, who has now been with his partner Phil for 30 years, says that the break-down was the result, in part, of him coming to terms with his long-suppressed homosexuality. 'All I knew was that you had a girlfriend, got married and had a family,' he says. 'Everything else was just with him [Tom] and not quite right.' But while coming to terms with being gay, which was a criminal offence until 1967, coming to terms with his abusive childhood was even harder. Happy moment: James with his adoptive father (left) and mother (right) at a cousin's wedding in Nottingham . 'I never told anybody. Not once,' he says. 'Not until I wrote the manuscript [for his memoir]. My partner was the first one to read it. 'He took it calmly. He wasn't disgusted and he took it all in his stride. We've been together for 30 years so It was good to say what had happened.' Telling his story: After keeping his experiences secret for more than 30 years, James is finally telling his story in the hope of helping others . And as the litany of historical sex abuse cases relating to Jimmy Saville began to emerge, Mr Williamson grew even more determined to tell his story. 'I used to read all that and think: ""That could have been me"".' Nevertheless, he says he has no plans to take his own attackers to court and questions the motivation of some of the people who have so far come forward. 'With Yewtree, I wonder why these people have left it so long,' he explains. 'If that was what they wanted, if they were so embittered, why didn't they do it before? I think the motivation sometimes is wrong. Now this has gone from not enough has been done to endless court cases and inquiries. The powers that be have gone from one extreme to another.' For his own part, Mr Williamson says life, his childhood apart, has treated him well. 'I feel incredibly lucky,' he says. 'You've got to be brave enough to create your own luck. If you sit with your bum on a sofa, nothing will happen. But if you get out and work, you will get that opportunity. I wanted to be somebody. I didn't want to be somebody working in a factory. Now I am somebody. I've now been retired for 20 years and I've had a great time.'","James Williamson, now 67, was first attacked aged nine by a stranger .

"It began life as a venture above a pizza shop in the US, and is now the world's most visited travel website. TripAdvisor is celebrating its 15th birthday today and with more than 200 million reviews and comments since the site went live in February 2000, it has certainly generated controversy. From debate over the authenticity of reviews to arguments that it helps ensure high standards, TripAdvisor has become loved and hated in equal measure. TripAdvisor is celebrating its 15th birthday today after starting out above a pizza shop in the US . But the website has certainly showed no signs of slowing down as it gathers more and more reviews of restaurants, resorts, hotels and activities - allowing users to leave a rating in bubbles - one for the worst experience and five for the best. So as the website turns 15, here are some bizarre facts you didn't know about TripAdvisor... 1. A slice of history . The company was founded in a small office above a pizza shop called Kosta’s in Needham, Massachusetts. 2. It wasn’t always about reviews . The site was originally designed as a B2B tool not a customer review site, but once the travel community started using it for that purpose the site quickly evolved to meet this need. The Grand Canyon in Arizona did not impress everyone, receiving a number of one-star reviews including one which called it an 'overblown sandy ditch' and saying 'nature is c***' (see above) 3. A world full of bubbles . The rating scores given by each reviewer are measured in ‘bubbles’ not stars. 4. The first of millions . The first ever traveller review was of Captain's House Inn in Chatham, Massachusetts – which earned a rating of 4 bubbles. 5. A top contributor . TripAdvisor member BradJill from Hong Kong has posted the most reviews in the history of the site – more than 3,200 and counting. TripAdvisor offers the chance to air you positive, or in this case, negative reviews; this one about Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer . Christ the Redeemer was called 'over-rated' and just a 'concrete pillar' in one-star reviews on TripAdvisor . 6. Green means go . Millions of consumers have seen the TripAdvisor ‘owl’ logo, but how many know why one eye is red and the other green? In fact, the two colours symbolise the way travellers choose where to go (green) and where not to go (red) on their next trip. 7. Sharing a great experience . The majority of reviews on TripAdvisor are positive – the average bubble rating is more than 4 out of 5. London is the most reviewed city in the world, with tourists delighted to leave reviews of hotels, restaurants and attractions . 8. The most reviewed city . The most reviewed city in the world is London – with over 1.8 million reviews of the city’s hotels, restaurants and attractions. 9. Looking for a bite to eat? Though for many the site is synonymous with hotels, there are actually more restaurants listed on TripAdvisor than hotels. 10. Every corner of the world covered . There are reviews on TripAdvisor for businesses in every country in the world – the most reviewed nation is the USA, the least reviewed is Tuvalu. Tuvalu is the least reviewed nation in the country - but chances are if you visited it would all be positive . 11. The growth of a global travel community . Though the site’s popularity originated in North America, the majority of TripAdvisor’s site traffic now comes from outside the US. 12. A decade on TripAdvisor . MariaAA is the longest registered member of the TripAdvisor community – having joined the site in 2002. 13. Plan, compare and book . TripAdvisor is not just about reviews – travellers can also compare price and availability for hotels and soon will be able to book their stay without leaving the site. It's not difficult to see what the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas has the most 5 bubble reviews . 14. 5 out of 5 . Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas is the hotel with the most five bubble reviews - over 9,500 and counting . 15. Wordsmiths . The total word count of all the reviews on TripAdvisor stands at more than 10 billion - nearly 12,000 times the number of words in the complete works of Shakespeare . Tourists called the Sphinx 'tiny' and surrounded by 'scum of the earth'. Visitors to the Pyramids said it was just camels and Brits in leggings .","The company began life in a small room in Needham, Massachusetts, US .
Now users can leave reviews on hotels, restaurants and attractions .
London is most reviewed city in the world, the US most reviewed nation ."
"In the run down three-star hotel where the family stays in Cilacap, opposite 'Death island' in southern Indonesia, Marlise Gularte de Cavalho describes what it's like waiting to see whether her cousin Rodrigo will be executed. 'For our family it is like dying a little every day,' she told Daily Mail Australia, 'it is hard to stay strong but you must.' The executions last month on Nusakambangan Island - where Rodrigo is being held on death row - of five foreigners, including fellow Brazilian Marco Archer, and the scheduled executions of the Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, has turned up the heat for the Gulartes. Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte was arrested in 2004 for attempting to smuggle six kilograms of cocaine into Indonesia hidden inside a surfboard. He has been on Death Island for the past seven years . Rodrigo's cousin Marlise Gularte de Cavalho told Daily Mail Australia: 'For our family it is like dying a little every day, it is hard to stay strong but you must' The families of death row prisoners Sergei Atlaoui of France and Rodrigo Gularte of Brazil leave the ferry dock at Wijayapura after visiting the prisoners at Nusa Kambangan in Cilacap on Tuesday . 'It is alarming,' Ms de Cavalho said, sitting anxiously in her hotel as she waited to return home after her latest visit. 'We are in shock. It would be better to know he would be in jail ten, 20 years even, more than not knowing when, if, this is going to happen.' Ms de Cavalho, who had taken time off from the wedding and party business she runs with her husband in Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil, said she had travelled in her past as a Club Med representative - even spending a year on Lindeman Island in Queensland - but that she and her family dreaded the trip to Indonesia. But they could not abandon Rodrigo. 'You come here and then you have to return to your life, but we are always waiting and that is what is terrible.' An emotional Angelita Muxfeldt holds photos of cousin Rodrigo Gularte, a Brazilian national who is on death row for smuggling drugs into Indonesia . Ms de Cavalho said if the families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran did, like her, end up in a hotel room in Cilacap waiting to take the ferry to death island that they 'must be as strong as possible and keep their faith' Clarisse Gularte (left), mother of convicted Brazilian drug smuggler Rodrigo Gularte, greets relatives of convicted French drug smuggler Serge Areski Atlaoui as they depart the Nusakambanga prison outpost in Cilacap . She has spent the past few weeks with Rodrigo's other cousin, Angelita Muxfeldt, and his mother Clarisse Muxfeldt taking the police ferry almost daily to visit Nusakambangan. There they find 42-year-old Rodrigo in the relatively clean surrounds of the island's newest prison, Pasir Putih, which lies not far from one of its famed white sand beaches. Angelita described the agony of waiting to find out whether her beloved cousin will face the firing squad as she sat alone in her hotel in in the port town of Cilicap. 'It's a torture for our family. Ten years in prison and then like in Bali you shoot them?' She had just farewelled her aunt, Rodrigo's distraught 70-year-old mother Clarisse Muxfeldt, who may have made her final trip to see her son on Nusakambangan or 'death' island. 'She wants to come back but I don't know. We must look after her now,' Angelita said. 'I must stay here and fight to have him transferred off the island. Angelita described Gularte as more like a brother than a cousin. 'He was such a lovely little boy. He is kind and gentle and that's what got him into trouble. 'It is unbelievable that they could shoot him here. 'When we found out there was no time it was such a rush to get here - no time to pack pictures of him.' Bali Nine members, Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) are on death row after being sentenced for heroin trafficking . July 31, 2004. A Customs officer inspects surfing boards used by Brazil's citizen Rodrigo Gularte to smuggle 6 kilograms of cocaine into Indonesia. Gularte was arrested by Indonesian authorities and is on death row . Rodrigo has been on the island for seven of the 11 years since he was arrested with two other Brazilians bringing six kilograms of South American cocaine into Indonesia, secreted in surfboards. As his devastated family have been insisting, to this day, Gularte is a paranoid schizophrenic who fell prey to drugs in his teens and to a Brazilian drug cartel in his early thirties. He was so deluded, that when he was arrested he told Indonesian police his two fellow couriers had nothing to do with the scheme. They were sent home. A year later, he was sentenced to death. Now, when Marlise and her family visit him, on the prison island, he tells them he doesn't believe that he will be executed. He insists a manned satellite over Nusakambangan is stalking him and voices in his head tell him he won't be executed because 'the voices say the death penalty has been abolished'. 'For the two hours we are there I guess he would talk lucidly for about 10 minutes,' Marlise said. Rodrigo is suspicious of Marlise 'because he thinks there are two of me ... the good Marlise and bad Marlise and he has to be careful of the bad'. Nusakambangan Island where Rodrigo Gularte has been held for the past seven years on death row . Rodrigo Gularte's family hired a government professor of psychiatry to examine Rodrigo in prison on Nusakambangan. The prison governor sent the professor's written diagnosis of Gularte's schizophrenia to the Indonesian Attorney General, but it was rejected . Angelita tried for years to make Rodrigo aware of the danger he was in, but afflicted by delusions he would tell her it 'was all a trick'. 'Now I don't tell him because he is calm and not frightened. Perhaps it ia better that way.' The family is pinning its hopes on a recommendation by their lawyers that Rodrigo is taken from the island and placed in a hospital on the mainland to be psychiatrically assessed. 'The idea of it makes him scared. He thinks what could save him is the danger, ' Angelita said. She said Rodrigo wanted to stay in the maximum security Pasir Putih priaon the island where other inmates were 'like family to him' and the guards 'like him'. 'He is a gentle man and wants to help everyone he can, he said. 'He doesn't realise execution could really happen.' The family hired a government professor of psychiatry to examine Rodrigo in prison on Nusakambangan. The prison governor sent the professor's written diagnosis of Gularte's schizophrenia to the Indonesian Attorney General H.M. Prasetyo, but it was rejected. 'They say no,' said Ms de Cavalho, 'they won't listen, the president has the power over people's lives that should only be God's.' 'They say no,' said Ms de Cavalho, 'they won't listen, the president has the power over people's lives that should only be God's' Under Indonesian law, a mental health disease can provide for clemency in death penalty cases. The Indonesian authorities told the Gularte family only a government doctor's diagnosis would be considered for Rodrigo's possible reprieve. 'What can we do?' Ms de Cavalho said. 'People have been very kind to us here. 'The Indonesian people we have spoken to, do not support the death penalty and I do not believe the majority of Indonesians do. 'But this waiting it is so heavy on the soul.' Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are likely to be moved from their Bali jail cells this week, with builders under orders to speed up construction of more isolation cells on the execution island. Ms de Cavalho said if their families did, like her, end up in a hotel room in Cilacap waiting to take the ferry to death island that they 'must be as strong as possible and keep their faith'. 'It is in the hands of God.'","Brazilian family tells of agonising wait for a decision on Indonesia's 'Death Island'

"A cattle farmer claimed today that the badger cull had ended his bovine tuberculosis nightmare that lasted more than ten years. James Griffiths - whose land in Tibberton, Gloucestershire, lies within the controversial pilot area - said his dairy herd was free of TB for the first time since 2004. The 48-year-old father-of-two claimed that this was because badgers carrying the disease had been killed in his area during culls over the past two years. Scroll down for video . End of the nightmare: James Griffiths - whose land in Tibberton, Gloucestershire, lies within the controversial badger cull pilot area - said his dairy herd was free of TB for the first time since 2004 . Farm: Mr Griffiths said being branded a ‘dirty herd’ for 11 years had cost his family farm ‘hundreds of thousands of pounds’ - and placed his family and staff under intolerable strain . The National Farmers’ Union insisted Mr Griffiths’s experience was being mirrored across Gloucestershire and Somerset as the number of TB cases start to fall in the badger cull areas. But animal rights activists have disputed the claims made by NFU president Meurig Raymond at the organisation’s annual conference in Birmingham yesterday. And the badger issue looks set to become a major political issue, with Environment Secretary Liz Truss telling farmers at the event that the Conservatives would extend the cull if re-elected. Mr Raymond urged politicians not to make the cull 'a party political issue' in the run-up to the general election, and criticised Labour for pledging to give up on culling. Moving forward: Mr Griffiths said his 1,700 strong herd was given a negative test for TB shortly after the second cull ended in November and the final all clear last Friday . Big issue: Environment Secretary Liz Truss (left) said at the National Farmers' Union conference  that the Conservatives would extend the cull if re-elected. NFU president Meurig Raymond is also pictured (right) Cattle: Mr Griffiths’s farm was one of those in the 132 sq mile Gloscon pilot badger cull, where disruption was blamed for only 274 badgers being killed . Yesterday Mr Griffiths said his 1,700 strong herd was given a negative test for TB shortly after the second cull ended in November and the final all-clear last Friday. Mr Griffiths said being branded a ‘dirty herd’ for 11 years had cost his family farm ‘hundreds of thousands of pounds’ - and placed his family and staff under huge strain. He added: ‘I could hardly believe the results because I was starting to think we’d never get out of it. After all those years of frustration I can finally see light at the end of the tunnel. ‘It’s been a completely debilitating and disheartening experience that really grinds you down. Because I’ve been living under the shadow of TB for so long now, I’m not sure exactly what it will mean. I’m still coming blinking into the bright daylight.’ Demonstration: A file photograph of anti-badger cull activists mounting patrols during the controversial trial . On patrol: Campaigners believe the cull 'fails our wildlife by subjecting badgers to inhumane shooting' and 'fails farmers by promising a solution to TB that simply doesn't work' Cull: Mr Griffiths said it was 'clear the reservoir of infection was outside the herd in the badger population' Mr Griffiths has had to manage the disease since taking over the family farm, which is in a TB hotspot along the border between Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. Ministers and farmers insist culling is vital to tackle TB, which can be spread from badgers to livestock - with more than 26,000 cattle slaughtered in England last year and multimillion-pound losses. But opponents say badger-culling is inhumane and ineffective, and alternatives such as vaccination should be pursued. An independent expert panel found that controlled shooting of badgers in the cull's first year was not effective or humane. In Gloucestershire just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot, falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in TB in livestock, leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there. The Government claimed the low numbers in Gloucestershire reflected the 'challenges of extensive unlawful protest and intimidation' by anti-cull campaigners. In Somerset, the location of the other pilot cull, a sufficient number of badgers were killed this year to lead to expected reductions in TB in cattle, with 341 culled, in a required range of 316 to 785. In both of the pilot areas, a significant proportion were killed by the more expensive cage trapping and shooting method - rather than 'controlled shooting' of free-running badgers. He added: ‘I don’t know if we were the longest down, but at 11 years we must have been one of the longest. They tested every two months and every time they tested we would lose a few animals, seven or eight on average. ‘We just couldn’t seem to get free of it. I know Defra (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) were concerned because they carried out expensive blood tests on every animal to find out if there was a reservoir of disease in the herd. There wasn’t. 'It was quite clear that the reservoir of infection was outside the herd in the badger population.’ Mr Griffiths’s farm was one of those in the 132 sq mile Gloscon pilot badger cull, where disruption was blamed for only 274 badgers being killed - instead of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in TB. He alleged that balaclava-wearing saboteurs posted negative messages on Facebook, followed his 19-year-old daughter home and frightened his 88-year-old mother Cynthia. ‘It’s was all pretty low level intimidation but it’s one thing being nose to nose with somebody in a balaclava shouting at you, another when it affects your kids and your family,’ Mr Griffiths added. Mr Raymond yesterday claimed incidents of TB had decreased in Somerset and Mr Griffiths’s case showed similar results could be expected in Gloucestershire. But campaigners were not convinced - and Claire Bass, Humane Society International/UK’s executive director, called the cull an ‘very expensive, cruel and ineffective farce’. She said: 'This cull fails our wildlife by subjecting badgers to inhumane shooting; it fails farmers by promising a solution to TB that simply doesn't work; and it fails the public by wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.’","James Griffiths says dairy herd is free of TB for first time since 2004 .

He was referred to palliative care when he was five weeks old and doctors said he would be lucky to reach the age of two. The parents of four-year-old boy Cooper Wallace, who was not expected to live pass the age of two are pushing the Victorian government to legalise medical marijuana . It was found cannabis oil was the only thing that would stop him having up to three seizures a day . Mum Cassie Batten, from Mernda in Melbourne's north-east, said Cooper started to deteriorate right in front her and her husband's eyes from the age of two. 'Early on he didn't have much quality of life he was tube-fed and he wasn't really aware of his surroundings,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'He quite frequently relied on oxygen, had no developmental skills and he didn't have a lot of pleasure in life at all.' Cooper's condition also meant he was rarely at home. Over one eight-month period, he spent only 16 days at home with his family.

But it was not until 2013 that Ms Batten and her husband, Rhett Wallace, considered an alternative to improve their son's quality of life - cannabis oil, which they had debated for 'quite a while'. In May 2013, a medical test called an EEG - used to detect epilepsy - showed Cooper was seizuring for 57 minutes out of 60.

"Disciplined: Former substitute teacher Tiffany Leiseth, 27, lost her Pennsylvania teacher's license and will spend a year on probation after pleading guilty to plying two teenage boys with beer . A former substitute teacher from Pennsylvania accused of having sexual encounters with two 18-year-old students while her husband was away has pleaded guilty to giving them alcohol but not having sex with them. Under Monday's plea bargain, 27-year-old Tiffany Leiseth, of Moon Township, lost her Pennsylvania teacher's license and will spend a year on probation. Leiseth's attorney, Michael DeRiso, said Tuesday the outcome was appropriate because the boys were old enough to consent to sex. Police and Allegheny County prosecutors had argued the boys couldn't legally consent because of their student-teacher relationship with Leiseth. The teens both testified at a preliminary hearing that the substitute English teacher at New Brighton High School sent them nude cellphone pictures and text messages before and after their separate trysts last year. Leiseth was initially charged with two counts of sexual contact with a student for allegedly having sex with two male students on back-to-back days last May, just hours after final classes but days before graduation. While both students were consenting adults at the time, Leiseth was charged because they had not yet officially graduated and maintained a student-teacher relationship with her. Investigators said Leiseith invited the two students over to home separately, on May 27 and 28, while her husband was away on business. She then offered both minors beer before engaging in intercourse. School district officials started investigating Leiseth on May 30, after another teacher overheard some students talking about lewd photos another male student had received. Scroll down for video . Plea deal: As part of an agreement with the prosecution, Leiseth was cleared of a sexual assault charge for sleeping with two 18-year-olds last May while her husband was away on business . Fired: Leiseth started as a substitute teacher for the town middle school in 2012-2013, and moved on to New Brighton High School the following school year. She has since been terminated . Tryst: Investigators said Leiseth invited the male students over to her family home on different days, offered them beer and then engaged in intercourse . As part of the plea deal announced Tuesday, prosecutors dropped a felony count of institutional sexual assault. In exchange, Leiseth agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges. Leiseth's attorney, Michael DeRiso, said his client did not try to seduce the students, bur rather one of the boys was courting her. Tiffany Leisith began working for the district at a middle school substitute teacher in the 2012-2013 year before being hired as a permanent substitute English teacher for the high school in 2013-2014. She was fired by the district in June.","Tiffany Leiseth, 27, lost her Pennsylvania teacher's license and will spend a year on probation as part of plea deal .

"Cliff Richard spoke of his agony last night at ‘absurd and untrue allegations’ as police investigate child abuse claims from two more alleged victims. The pop star is now accused of sexually assaulting a total of three victims in the UK and abroad, it can be revealed. Last night the 74-year-old released a statement saying he hoped ‘the truth will prevail’ after a letter from the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton revealed the police investigation has ‘increased significantly in size’ and officers were dealing with ‘more than one allegation’. Scroll down for video . The police investigation into veteran singer Sir Cliff Richard has 'increased significantly in size' since its inception and involves 'more than one allegation', police say . In his letter to MP Keith Vaz, David Crompton, South Yorkshire Police chief constable (pictured), said he was unable to give a date when the investigation into the singer would conclude . Mr Compton's letter to MP Keith Vaz (pictured) stated police had not written to Sir Cliff directly to update him on the investigation . Distraught, Sir Cliff said he had no idea who his accusers were and hit out at police for refusing to disclose details to him. He said: ‘I have no idea where these absurd and untrue allegations come from. The police have not disclosed details to me. ‘I have never, in my life, assaulted anyone and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I have cooperated fully with the police, and will, of course, continue to do so. ‘Beyond stating that the allegations are completely false, it would not be appropriate for me to say anything further until the investigation has concluded, which I hope will be very soon. ‘In the meantime, I would, again, like to thank everyone for supporting me through this unbelievably difficult period.’ Two new alleged victims have come forward since the singer’s £3million Berkshire home was raided last August by detectives investigating a historic allegation of sexual assault on a teenage boy under 16 at a Christian rally in 1985. South Yorkshire Police has set up a dedicated team of officers, under the name Operation Kaddie, to investigate allegations that three boys were molested. Detectives have already taken statements from a number of witnesses as the probe widens. Prosecutors are also liaising with police to give ‘investigative advice’ on how to take the investigation forward after officers received a significant number of new lines of inquiry. Sir Cliff Richard says he has 'no idea' where the 'absurd and untrue allegations' come from . Last August, BBC Reporter David Sillito reported live from Cliff Richard's home as it was raided by police . A BBC news crew reported from the entrance to the estate in Berkshire where Cliff Richard owns a property during the raid although no charges had been made against him . The devastating blow for the singer, who had hoped to be cleared very shortly, emerged after the force faced blistering criticism for a secret deal with the BBC to film a raid on his house. Last night chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee Keith Vaz took the unusual step of releasing a letter from Mr Crompton confirming the investigation had been stepped up in light of the new information, and he claimed Sir Cliff’s lawyers had been constantly updated. Mr Crompton wrote: ‘South Yorkshire Police detectives are in very regular contact with Sir Cliff Richard’s lawyers. Typically this involves a verbal update about once a fortnight. ‘We have not written directly to Sir Cliff Richard. It is the responsibility of his lawyers to ensure he is fully briefed on the conversations which have taken place with investigators. ‘This is an investigation which has increased significantly in size since its inception. Sir Cliff Richard’s lawyers are aware that there is more than one allegation.’ Cliff Richard yesterday issued this statement: ‘I have no idea where these absurd and untrue allegations come from. The police have not disclosed details to me. ‘I have never, in my life, assaulted anyone and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I have cooperated fully with the police, and will, of course, continue to do so. Beyond stating that the allegations are completely false, it would not be appropriate for me to say anything further until the investigation has concluded, which I hope will be very soon. ‘In the meantime, I would, again, like to thank everyone for supporting me through this unbelievably difficult period.’ The star was on holiday in Portugal when detectives swooped on his penthouse suite in Sunningdale without warning on August 14 in a blaze of publicity as the BBC beamed live television images of detectives rifling through his belongings during a five-hour raid. He flew back to the UK to be quizzed by detectives on August 24. The force released a statement at the time saying the singer had entered one of their stations voluntarily: ‘A 73-year-old man has spoken us in relation to an allegation of a sexual nature dating back to 1985. The man was interviewed under caution but was not arrested.’ The police investigation first began last year when a man, now in his 40s, came forward to claim Sir Cliff sexually assaulted him at a rally in Sheffield held by American evangelist Billy Graham. He initially contacted Operation Yewtree, the Scotland Yard investigation set up in October 2012 to examine claims against Savile and other celebrities. The report was passed to South Yorkshire Police last year. Police have already been heavily criticised over the way the case against the singer has unfolded. The raid was recorded live by a BBC helicopter circling overhead capturing officers wearing forensic gloves searching through drawers after a reporter contacted the force claiming they had information about the investigation. BBC journalists were given 18 hours’ notice of the raid, an aerial photograph of the singer’s apartment and even details of which gate the police would use. On Tuesday the Mail revealed a damning report by independent investigator and former chief constable Andy Trotter had blasted police for confirming details of a ‘highly sensitive and confidential’ investigation to the BBC. A Metropolitan Police investigation into the leak to the BBC has been unable to find the source. A day on from the controversial raid, South Yorkshire Police said it had received a number of calls with information. Sir Cliff has now vowed to sell his Berkshire home, telling friends he feels like he has been ‘ransacked by burglars’.","South Yorkshire Police say sex offence inquiry has 'expanded significantly'

"British cyber-police have shut down a virus network which infected millions of computers with malicious software to steal people's passwords and banking information. The 'malware' was spread by Windows users opening links sent out via phishing emails and social networks, inadvertently downloading a virus onto their computers. Seven servers located across Europe which used by the criminals to control infected computers were shut down overnight, including one situated in Gosport, Hampshire. Virus: The Ramnit malware, spread on Microsoft Windows computers, has been brought down by authorities . A total of 3.2million computers have fallen prey to the 'Ramnit' virus over the past three years, 33,000 of which were in the UK. The operation to bring down the network was led by the National Crime Agency's National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), along with authorities in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. A spokesman for the NCA said that the botnet spread malware via seemingly trustworthy links sent out on phishing emails or social networking websites. He said: 'If users running Windows operating systems clicked on the links, the malware would be installed, infecting the computer. 'Infected computers would then be under the control of criminals, enabling them to access personal or banking information, steal passwords and disable antivirus protection.' Criminals have used the network to steal money from bank accounts, according to the agency. Operation: The National Crime Agency led the investigation into the network of infected computers . None of the people responsible for the virus network have been arrested, according to the NSA, but they added that the investigation is still ongoing. Despite the operation to dismantle the cyber-conspiracy, officials have urged web users to take care over clicking on unfamiliar links which are sent to them. The Government is offering free software which can detect whether a computer has been infected and remove the virus if necessary. Authorities were alerted to the threat from Ramnit by Microsoft after the US-based computer giant noticed a spike in virus activity. Paul Gillen, from the European Cybercrime Centre, said: 'We worked together to shut down the command and control servers for the network in various countries across the European Union. The criminals have lost control of the infrastructure they were using.' Steve Pye of the NCCU added: 'Through this operation, we are disrupting a cyber crime threat which has left thousands of ordinary computer users in the UK at risk of having their privacy and personal information compromised. 'This malware effectively gives criminals a back door so they can take control of your computer, access your images, passwords or personal data and even use it to circulate further spam messages or launch illegal attacks on other websites. 'As a result of this action, the UK is safer from Ramnit, but it is important that individuals take action now to disinfect their machines, and protect their personal information.'","The Ramnit virus was spread by links in emails and social media .

"Computers already have bested human champions in 'Jeopardy!' and chess, but artificial intelligence now has gone to master an entirely new level: 'Space Invaders.' Google scientists have revealed AI software that can do better than humans on dozens of Atari video games from the 1980s, like video pinball, boxing, and 'Breakout.' The firm's software was able to learn the game, working out the rules itself in a major step forward. Google scientists have revealed AI software that can do better than humans on dozens of Atari video games from the 1980s, like video pinball, boxing, and Sapce Invaders. The computer program, called Deep Q-network, wasn't given much in the way of instructions to start, but in time it did better than humans in 29 out of 49 games and in some cases, like video pinball, it did 26 times better, according to a new study released Wednesday by the journal Nature. The idea is to create a 'general learning system' that can figure tasks out by trial and error and eventually to stuff even humans have difficulty with. The aim is not to make video games a spectator sport, turning couch potatoes who play games into couch potatoes who watch computers play games. The real accomplishment: computers that can teach themselves to succeed at tasks, learning from scratch, trial and error, just like humans. The computer program, called Deep Q-network, wasn't given much in the way of instructions to start, but in time it did better than humans in 29 out of 49 games and in some cases, like video pinball, it did 26 times better, according to a new study released Wednesday by the journal Nature. It's a first time an artificial intelligence program bridged different type of learning systems, said study author Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind in London. Deep Q 'can learn and adapt to unexpected things,' Hassabis said in a news conference. 'These types of systems are more human-like in the way they learn.' In the submarine game 'Seaquest,' Deep Q came up with a strategy that the scientists had never considered. 'It's definitely fun to see computers discover things that you didn't figure out yourself,' said study co-author Volodymyr Mnih, also of Google. Sebastian Thrun, director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University, who wasn't part of the research, said in an email: 'This is very impressive. 'Most people don't understand how far (artificial intelligence) has come. 'And this is just the beginning.' Nothing about Deep Q is customized to Atari or to a specific game. A youth tries a Ms. Pac-Man TV game in New York. Computers already have bested human champions in Jeopardy! and chess, but artificial intelligence now has gone to master an entirely new level: video games. The idea is to create a 'general learning system' that can figure tasks out by trial and error and eventually to stuff even humans have difficulty with, Hassabis said. This program, he said, 'is the first rung of the ladder.' Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor Emma Brunskill, who also wasn't part of the study, said this learning despite lack of customization 'brings us closer to having general purpose agents equipped to work well at learning a large range of tasks, instead of just chess or just 'Jeopardy!'' To go from pixels on a screen to making decisions on what to do next, without even a hint of pre-programmed guidance, 'is really exciting,' Brunskill said. 'We do that as people.' The idea is that when the system gets scaled up, maybe it could work like asking a phone to plan a complete trip to Europe, book all the flights and hotels on its own 'and it sorts it all out as if you have a personal assistant,' Hassabis said. Google scientists have revealed AI software that can do better than humans on dozens of Atari video games from the 1980s, like video pinball, boxing, and 'Breakout.' But to some ways of thinking, Deep Q wasn't even as smart as a toddler because it can't transfer learned experiences from one situation to another and it doesn't get abstract concepts, Hassabis said. Deep Q had trouble with 'Ms. Pac Man' and 'Montezuma's Revenge' because they are games that involve more planning ahead, he said. Next, the scientists will try the system on more complicated games of the 1990s and beyond, perhaps a complicated game like 'Civilization,' where gamers create an entire empire to see if it can stand the test of time. Deep Q isn't showing what Hassabis would call creativity, he said:  'I would call it figuring out something that already existed in the world.' Creativity would be if the program created its own computer game, Hassabis said. Artificial intelligence isn't there, he said. At least not yet.","System will eventually be used to work out complex problems .

"Spanish police stopped every one of 10,000 vehicles leaving Gibraltar for the mainland yesterday, causing six-hour traffic jams in the latest escalation in the standoff over the Rock. Officers from the Royal Gibraltar Police were forced to impose diversions and create beachside holding areas as Spanish authorities 'choked' the border, causing massive tailbacks in 30C heat. It was the second day that border guards had blocked links to the mainland, in a move that seemed calculated to bring Gibraltar to a standstill. Scroll down for video . Border chaos: Hundreds of motorists stand in the sweltering heat. Officers from the Royal Gibraltar Police were forced to impose diversions and create beachside holding areas . Stuck: Spanish police stopped every one of 10,000 vehicles leaving Gibraltar for the mainland yesterday, causing six-hour traffic jams . Blockage: It was the second day that border guards had blocked links to the mainland, in a move that seemed calculated to bring Gibraltar to a standstill . The move follows a string of recent . incidents which have included Spanish police opening fire on a jet-skier . in British waters, incursions by Spanish police boats, and Spanish air . force jets roaring across the territory. In the extraordinary jet-ski incident last month, a boat from Spain’s Guardia Civil entered Gibraltan waters and took potshots at 32-year-old Dale Villa as he rode his watercraft close to a popular beach. Mr Villa was not wanted for any particular crime and was not thought to have strayed out of British waters into Spanish territory – although the line between the two is far from clear to people in the sea. Foreign Office minister David Lidington had condemned the shooting as ‘completely unacceptable’ and called on Spain to take action against those responsible. Most recently Spanish fishermen sparked a stand-off with the Royal Navy as they attempted to disrupt the creation of an artificial reef in the Bay of Gibraltar last week. The fishermen used . fast boats to weave in between British vessels involved in the . reef-laying operation in a bid to create large waves to disrupt the . work, the Sunday Express reported. Gibraltar's Santa Barbara beach: The move by Spanish border authorities followed anger over a British decision to lay an artificial reef in the Bay of Gibraltar, which was fiercely opposed by Spanish fishermen . Diplomatic crisis: Last month a boat from Spain's Guardia Civil entered Gibraltan waters and took potshots at 32-year-old British jet-skier Dale Villa as he rode his jet-ski close to a popular beach . Jet-skier: Dale Villa was not wanted for any particular crime and was not thought to have strayed out of British waters into Spanish territory last month . Intervention . by a Royal Navy patrol boat brought an end to the protests. A Gibraltar . government spokesman has accused Spain of launching the 'draconian' border checks which continued yesterday in 'retaliation'. The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain. Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty. Yet, despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory. The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltor from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession. The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy. Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping. Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the responsibility of the UK Government. Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres. He said the decision to lay the reef, . which consists of large concrete blocks sunk to the bottom of the bay, . had been taken on environmental grounds. However, he added, it had infuriated . Spanish fishermen since it would also foil any attempts by their vessels . to carry out illegal trawling of the bottom of the Bay of Gibraltar. Criticising the Spanish government's . response, the spokesman added to the Sunday Express: 'Not only are these . measures affecting thousands of innocent Spanish workers who make their . living on Gibraltar, but we are extremely concerned about pensioners . and families with young children being forced to suffer in this way just . because they want to visit the mainland.' Yesterday's . stand-off is just the latest incident to raise tensions between the . British and Spanish governments over Gibraltar, which is at the southern . end of the Iberian peninsula and has been under British rule since . 1713. Under the Gibraltar . constitution of 2006, Gibraltar governs its own affairs, though some . powers, such as defence and foreign relations, remain the responsibility . of the UK Government. The . territory's residents have twice rejected proposals for Spanish . sovereignty in a 1967 referendum and again in 2002, but Spain still . asserts a claim to the territory. Earlier this month, angry Gibraltan . government officials accused four Spanish warplanes of 'buzzing' the . territory without warning, an accusation disputed by the Spanish Defence . Ministry. And just days earlier Prime Minister David Cameron confronted his Spanish counterpart over ‘unacceptable’ threats made to Gibraltar after shots were fired at a jet-skier. He warned Mariano Rajoy that he would not tolerate breaches of international law. It came after Spanish police twice entered British waters, despite British warnings not to do so. Mr Cameron used a meeting in Brussels to censure Mr Rajoy, as tensions between Spain and the UK have escalated. The Foreign Office protested to the Spanish government after a boat from Spain’s Guardia Civil entered Gibraltan waters and took potshots at 32-year-old Dale Villa as he rode his jet-ski close to a popular beach. Just three days later, a police boat was seen in British waters again. The stranglehold on the border between the 2.6sq/mile territory and the Spanish mainland is the latest issue to raise tensions over Gibraltar. A spokesman for the territory's governor told the Sunday Express that British officials had pressed the Spanish government to stop its actions on the border.","Spanish authorities 'choked' the border, causing massive tailbacks yesterday in 30C heat .

"A man was engulfed in a fireball and rushed to hospital covered in burns after he blocked up mouseholes in his flat with aerosol foam before trying to light his oven. Over the course of two days, the man attempted to stop rodents from getting into his flat in Acton, west London, by filling any holes with eight cans worth of expanding foam. But he had failed to ventilate his home properly, and when he tried to switch on the gas cooker in his kitchen the propellant used in the spray cans ignited and burst into flames. A man was engulfed in a fireball and rushed to hospital covered in burns after he blocked up mouseholes and filled in gaps under his cooker (pictured) in his flat with aerosol foam before trying to light the oven . A witness told fire investigators that the man was 'engulfed in a ball of fire'. He suffered burns to his hands and arms that required hospital treatment. Around ten fire-fighters from Acton and Ealing fire stations were called to the flat at around 1pm on Sunday, with two fire engines deployed to the scene. London Fire Brigade said the man had used the foam to plug gaps around the cooker and skirting boards in his kitchen. But the expanding foam contained the highly flammable propellant gas, methylene-diphenyl-diisocyanate 4,4'. The expanding foam, pictured underneath the cooker, contained the highly flammable propellant gas, methylene-diphenyl-diisocyanate 4,4', which is thought to have ignited when he switched on the oven . The gas is emitted from the foam as it expands and dries out, and as it is heavier than air, sinks and forms an invisible cloud. It is believed that the gas ignited when the man switched on the cooker. A fire brigade spokesman said the fire had been brought under control within ten minutes, and the man had been taken to hospital but was now recovering at home. 'Always read safety warnings on the side of aerosol cans and observe the safety advice closely,' the spokesman added. 'Areas where expanding foam is drying out should always be very well ventilated.'","Victim spent two days plugging gaps with eight cans of expanding foam .

"Most people will have heard music that sounds a bit like cats fighting - but it turns out that is not far from the kind music our feline pets actually enjoy. Scientists have created what they say is the first species-specific music for domestic cats by replicating some of the sounds the animals produce themselves. They say the music could provide new ways for cat owners to enrich the environments that their pets live in while also helping to calm agitated animals. Scroll down for audio . There are many popular video cats 'playing' musical instruments (like the one above) but in reality they prefer music that mimics the purrs and natural high pitched sounds they produce when meowing or feeding . The cat music has been created by psychologists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and musicians at the University of Maryland. The music uses rhythms that mimics the pulsating of a cat's purr along with melodies that were similar to their high pitched meows. In tests against classical human music by composers Johann Sebastian Bach and Gabriel Faure, the cats showed stronger reactions to the feline tunes. Just like in humans, however, the younger the cat was, the more excited it got about the music - with middle aged cats seeming the least interested. It was a simple audio only video of a cat named Phantom doing what cats do - purring. Yet YouTube decided that there was something amiss with the clip. The video sharing site flagged the hour long clip of the cat's purr as having infringed the copyright of music giants, EMI and PRS for Music. The offending piece was an hour-long, audio-only YouTube upload of a cat named Phantom, posted in March by Digihaven. The video was flagged by YouTube's Content ID system as possibly using a song called Focus. Phantom was accused of a 12-second video loop infringement violation, in the video which had been viewed less than 3,000 times. The owner Digihaven has since filed a dispute and was partially successful, with EMI lifting its claim. Phantom remains unsigned by any music label. Professor Charles Snowdon, a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told MailOnline: 'Lots of people think their pets like the same music they like and some laboratories require the playing of music as ""enrichment"". 'But we have little understanding of what pets actually like. 'We looked at the natural sounds that cats make and their voices are an octave higher than a high human voice. 'They also have lots of sliding frequencies in their calls which are rare in human music.' Together with David Teie, a musician and composer at the Univeristy of Maryland, Professor Snowdon, studied the noises that cats make naturally to create their music. Rather than imitating the noise that cats make, the researchers instead used them as inspiration to create new music. The idea was to produce something that would be enjoyable for cats yet also not be unpleasant to human ears either. They created one piece called Cozmo's Air with a pulse running through it that matched the sound of purring with a rhythm of 1380 beats per minute. Another track, called Rusty's Ballad, used a rhythm of 250 beats per minute to mimic the rate of suckling by kittens. The idea of music for cats occurs regularly in art like in this 19th century painting titled Cats Orchestra and in nursery rhymes like The Cat and the Fiddle, but in reality cat 'singing' sounds awful to our human ears . The researchers, whose study is published in the journal of Applied Animal Behaviour Science, avoided using some of the highest frequency noises found in cats howls as they are often related to fear and threat. Instead they used sounds that slid from one frequency to another at the lower range of cat vocalisations. The resulting music sounds a little like cats yowling or someone learning to play a violin with an underlying purr beneath the melody. Some cats respond more to human music than others like the cat named Bob above that would entertain passersby with accompanyment from street musician James Bowen in London's Covent Garden . They tested the music on 47 domestic cats, both male and female. They were played three minutes segments of either a cat composition and human music that alternated between two speakers. The researchers chose Faure's Elegie, which has a pulse rate similar to the human resting heart beat of 66 beats per minute and uses some sliding frequencies, and Bach's Air on a G String, which has a pulse rate of 56 beats per minute. They found that the cats approached and rubbed themselves on the speakers producing the music written for felines far more often than those producing the human music. The cats were also quicker to respond to the feline-specific music. Musician David Teie, a composer at the Univeristy of Maryland, based the music on the noises that cats make naturally. The idea was to produce something that would be enjoyable for cats yet also not be unpleasant to human ears either. One piece called Cozmo's Air has beat running through it that matches the sound of purring - with a rhythm of 1380 beats per minute. Another track, called Rusty's Ballad, uses a rhythm of 250 beats per minute to mimic the rate of suckling by kittens. The researchers avoided the highest frequency noises found in cats howls as they are often related to fear and threat. Instead they used sounds that slid from one frequency to another at the lower range of cat vocalisations. Professor Snowdon said that their study showed music cat owners find relaxing would not necessarily produce the same effect in their pets. He said: 'Basically, human music is not very interesting to cats. 'We think that cat music will be more interesting and calming for cats than random human music, which most of us use now. 'It could also be of value in animal shelters where more attention has been paid to helping dogs so far than to cats.' Professor Snowden is now also taking the lessons he and his colleagues learned with cats to apply to other animals. They have already composed music for tamarins - small monkeys found in South America - after showing they are indifferent to human music. Their work could help provide new ways of calming or exciting our pets and animals in zoos, he said. He said: 'They can be calmed with music that we designed to be calming and also aroused with music designed to be arousing.'","Scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison composed tunes for cats .

"An entrepreneur who founded a surfboard tracking business has been jailed after he faked VAT claims for £270,000 when his business failed. Surfer Andrew Smith, of Newport, South Wales, launched his business putting tracking chips into surfboards and even tried to attract investment from Dragon's Den star Richard Farleigh. But the business, called surfboardtracker.com, began to fail and Smith started making false VAT claims in a £270,000 racket. Andrew Smith has been jailed after it emerged he was involved in a £270,000 VAT scam as his business failed . Five years later most of the father-of-three's income was coming directly from the taxman, after Smith faked invoices and bank statements. The scam was referred to as a 'ticking time bomb' and was was exposed after he gave an officer from HMRC fake invoices, claiming he had spent tens of thousands of pounds on microchips at a time when the business was making sales of less than £5,000. Smith has been left penniless and was jailed for 20 months after he admitted fraud. Cardiff Crown Court heard that Smith hoped to make a fortune by launching a business putting tracking chips into surfboards. Richard Farleigh'had preliminary discussions' about investing in the surfboard tracker firm but decided against the idea . The business sold microchips to the surfing and extreme sports community to allow their equipment to be tracked if it was stolen. In 2008 a spokesman for Mr Farleigh's company was quoted as saying:  'We're investing as much in Andrew as in the idea. He's so enthusiastic. We almost have to hold him back sometimes.' But Mr Farleigh has told MailOnline that, though he did have 'preliminary discussions' about investing in the company, he did not put any money into the venture. Five years later Smith's VAT fraud was exposed. The court was told an officer from HMRC met with Smith in April 2013 to check over his claim for VAT repayment for buying parts from a foreign supplier. He gave her invoices showing that in March 2013 he had spent £45,748.25 on microchips from a company in Germany. Yet investigations showed that the invoices were faked and the company had never had dealing with Surfboardtracker.com. At the time the company was making just £5,000 in sales. HMRC then discovered bank statements, which had been submitted by Smith, were also falsified and most of his income was coming from the taxman. Prosecutor Nuhu Gobir said: 'It didn't appear the defendant was running a legitimate business.' Smith, of Newport, South Wales, told officers his wife had been diagnosed with cancer in August 2008 and from that date he worked from home and became her carer until she recovered. He said: 'I'm going to be honest with you. Some of these numbers, they have been messed up, I have fabricated them. I'll hold my hands up.' He admitted the invoices and bank statements were false and had been created on his computer and that the information in his VAT returns was not correct. Chris Rees, defending Smith, described his scam as being a 'ticking time bomb'. 'It was a matter of time before he was discovered,' said Mr Rees. Smith began to fake invoices and bank statements and was making most of his money from the taxman . 'It was a legitimate business to start off with, albeit a business that failed. It was at one stage a business regarded as highly promising,' he added. Mr Rees said it should be noted that Smith committed the fraud to pay for his family and home, not to live in luxury. Smith had admitted being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of VAT. Jailing Smith for 20 months, Recorder Ian Murphy said he accepted the 'genesis' of him beginning the fraud was his wife's illness. 'It was an extremely aggressive form of cancer that had a dramatic impact on her health,' he said. No application was made to recoup the £273,000 because Smith has no assets. An earlier version of this story stated that Richard Farleigh invested £60,000 in surfboardtracker.com. In fact, while Mr Farleigh considered investing in the company, he did not put any money into the venture. We are happy to clarify this.","Andrew Smith launched a surfboard business, installing microchip trackers .

"Hundreds of Palestinians have been evacuated from their homes after heavy flooding, caused by rain and drainage issues, caused water levels in Gaza Valley to rise by up to 10 feet. Nearly 80 families were forced to flee to a nearby UN refugee shelter as areas on the Gaza Strip were swamped under the muddy water. Children and elderly people had to help clear some of the water from the roads using small buckets, while horses and carriages were also being used to get personal belongings and family members through the murky brown sludge. Hundreds of Palestinians, including this father with his two children, have been left homeless or struggling to cope after flooding in al-Mughraqa in Gaza . Children, including this young boy in bare feet, and elderly people have had to help clear some of the water from the roads and pavements using small buckets . The floods led to false accusations that Israel had opened up dams along the river to intentionally cause the flooding, even though no dams exist in southern Israel. A spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Palestinian Territories (COGAT) told VICE News: 'These claims, I don't know who started them, but they are completely false. 'There are no dams in the southern part of Israel so we couldn't open any dams because there aren't any. I don't know how these rumours got around.' In an unrelated incident, an Israeli power company cut electricity in Nablus and Jenin, which are on the West Bank rather than Gaza, on the same day, for a short period of time. The state-owned company said that they made the decision to cut power because the Palestinian government owes them $492 million. The Israel Electric Corporation said it had long warned about the debt. A statement released by the company said: 'We limited for 45 minutes today the supply of electricity to five power lines in Nablus and Jenin.' Palestinians claimed that Israeli authorities opened dams along the river, causing water to rush down into a number of villages - but Israel said there are no dams to open . One boy, pictured, helps an elderly women get across the water with two donkeys . Some of the evacuated families have been set up in nearby shelters for Palestinian refugees, which are sponsored by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). They will be provided with food and drink, but do not know when they can return home. In 2010 and December 2013 flooding  forced 100 families from their homes. At the time local defence services said they saved seven people who had been at risk of drowning. One gentleman stands outside what used to be a house . One boy braves the water, finding an old sign to clutch on to as he makes his way through the town . It is thought that the water is three feet deep in places. It has caused chaos on the roads, including this gentleman whose white car got stuck . The UN also had to declare a state of 'emergency' in Gaza City last November after two days of heavy rain caused flooding in the war-ravaged area. Some 100,000 Palestinians also remain homeless across Gaza after a bloody 50-day war between Israeli and Hamas militants destroyed homes, roads and services. UNRWA said in January that it cannot afford to repair the homes damaged last year because donors have failed to pay. It said in a statement: 'The agency has exhausted all funding to support repairs and rental subsidies. '$5.4 billion (£3.5bn) was pledged at the Cairo aid conference last October and virtually none of it has reached Gaza. This is distressing and unacceptable.' Camels, donkeys and horses are being used by locals to move belongings and people through the water-logged area . One boy braves getting into a sunken container in the middle of the water.

"Alison Baker, 59 (above outside court), was found to be three times over the limit after driving to a garage in Exeter, Devon, to buy wine twice on one morning . A woman who ran a drink-drive awareness course for more than 20 years has been banned from the road after being caught behind the wheel while three times over the limit. Alison Baker, 59, was found to have 104mg of alcohol in her breath after driving to her local garage in Exeter, Devon, to buy wine twice in one morning. Exeter Magistrates' Court heard how a garage worker tipped police off about her being drunk after becoming concerned that she was not in a fit state to drive. Officers were sent to her home and when she eventually answered the door she was so drunk that she had to grip walls and furniture to stand. She told police she had only had a gulp of wine but was found to be three times over the legal top limit. Baker, who ran drink-drive awareness courses for Devon County Council for 20 years, denied drink-driving and blamed the high reading on 'post-driving consumption'. However, district judge Stephen Nicholls convicted her of drink-driving and handed her an interim driving ban until she is sentenced next month. During the trial, Baker denied using her intimate professional knowledge of alcohol units and driving to 'tailor her defence'. She said she drove to the garage at 8am on May 13 last year to buy the first bottle of wine because she 'could not cope'. The court heard Baker used alcohol for pain relief for arthritis and had problems with her knees, legs and wrist. Giving evidence, she admitted that she drank herself into 'oblivion' while self-medicating and would often drink until she passed out. She also admitted that she would decant wine from bottles so that she could hide them from her disapproving landscape gardener husband Andy who hated her drinking. She said she had only drunk a small mug of wine after her first visit to the garage on May 13 but realised by 10.30am that 'it was not enough wine to knock me out' and so drove back to the garage to get a second bottle. Garage worker Devon Greening claimed he saw Baker 'stumble and trip' the second time she entered the shop to buy her second bottle of wine. CCTV was shown to the court but Baker did not appear unsteady on her feet. However, Mr Greening said that he was also concerned that she smelt strongly of alcohol and said he would have 'felt bad if she hit someone'. He reported Baker to police after she left the garage to drive home. Police officer John Larcombe-Ford arrived at her Exeter home ten minutes later. Baker claimed to the officer that she had drank more than one and a half bottles of wine at her home in the ten minutes between arriving home and him arriving. She told the court: 'I can't remember the police coming to the house.' Baker (pictured outside court), who ran drink-drive awareness courses for Devon County Council for 20 years, denied drink driving and blamed the high reading on the police breathalyser on her 'post-driving consumption' Mr Larcombe-Ford said she 'was clearly drunk and unsteady on her feet' when she answered the door. He said she gripped the walls, door and furniture for support and slumped into a reclining armchair. Baker told him she had had 'a swig from a bottle of wine' in the previous 20 minutes but she was arrested. On the trip to the police station, she told him that she was 'a trainer and facilitator for drink-driving awareness courses'. The officer said colleagues searched for empty bottles at her home but found nothing apart from a full water bottle which had had wine poured into it. The court heard how she would often hide empty bottles of wine from her husband, even scurrying them away in the equipment she used for her drink-drive courses. Appearing at court, Baker claimed she downed just 'two units' between trips to the garage saying five units is the legal limit. She added: 'I would not normally drive with any alcohol in my system. 'I knew I was not over the legal limit. I knew I had not drunk enough to put me over the limit.' Baker was convicted of drink-driving at Exeter Magistrates' Court (pictured) and will be sentenced next month . She denied downing the first bottle of wine before driving back to the garage and said: 'I had had a mugful - 175mls.' Prosecutor Sarah Hornblower said the high alcohol reading was not contested by Baker who claimed she was under the top limit of 35mg of alcohol when she drove. However, the district judge concluded that Baker had drunk most if not all of the first bottle of wine before driving back to the garage to get some more. Baker will be sentenced next month but may not be ordered to go on the drink-drive rehabilitation course which she used to run after the prosecutor said it would not be appropriate. The former drink-drive tutor has previously condemned driving while over the limit and said in a previous interview: 'The realities of life without a driving licence can be difficult to bear, some people lose everything. 'They struggle to pay their mortgage, lose their home, their wife walks out and takes the kids. 'There is also a real stigma and sense of shame attached to drink driving convictions. Some people find it difficult to live with the guilt of having committed an offence.'","Alison Baker, 59, ran drink-drive awareness course for more than 20 years .

The Federal Bureau of Investigation  issued a 'Wanted' poster for Evgeniy Bogachev, who is charged in the United States with running a computer attack network called GameOver Zeus that allegedly stole more than $100 million from online bank accounts. Bogachev has been charged by federal authorities in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with conspiracy, computer hacking, wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering in connection with his alleged role as administrator of GameOver Zeus. Scroll down for video . Big payout: The FBI on Tuesday announced a $3 million reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of a Russian hacker Evgeniy Bogachev accused of stealing $100m from US banks . The Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a 'Wanted' poster for Evgeniy Bogachev (second left), who is charged in the United States with running a computer attack network called GameOver Zeus . He also faces federal bank fraud conspiracy charges in Omaha, Nebraska related to his alleged involvement in an earlier variant of Zeus malware known as 'Jabber Zeus.' Bogachev is 'known to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the Black Sea in his boat,' the FBI wrote in the wanted poster. CBS reports that the FBI described the botnet in 2014 as 'an extremely sophisticated type of malware designed specifically to steal banking and other credentials from the computers it infects.' The FBI said the virus was mostly spread through spam email or phishing messages. Bureau officials said they believed Bogachev was still in Russia. He could not immediately be reached for comment. Joseph Demarest, head of the FBI's cyber crime division, said the agency is aware of 60 different cyber threat groups linked to nation-states. He did not identify which countries were believer to be behind these groups. Boat enthusiast: Bogachev is 'known to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the Black Sea in his boat,' the FBI wrote in the wanted poster . Demarest said that Russia's internal security agency, the FSB, had recently expressed tentative interest in working with U.S. authorities on investigating cybercrimes. He did not link the offer of cooperation to the Bogachev case. China has not expressed any interest in cooperating with the United States on cybercrimes, he said. Last November, the United States indicted five Chinese military officers and accused them of hacking into U.S. nuclear power, metals and solar products industries. Demarest said the FBI learned within a month of Sony Pictures' first report of a large-scale cyberattack that North Korea was behind it. 'We were absolutely positive in a very short period of time' that the North Korean government was behind the attack, he said. Despite assertions from some security experts that the Sony Pictures hackers might have had help from one or more insiders at the studio, Demarest said investigators had found no evidence to back up such claims. The FBI had learned of 'over 100 major' cyberattacks in 2014, Demarest said, adding that evidence of insider collusion had turned up in 'less than a handful' of those cases.","The FBI is offering $3million reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Russian hacker Evgeniy Bogachev .

"Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend today admitted police suspect drugs were at the home they shared when she drowned. Nick Gordon made the disclosure in legal papers as he brought - then dropped - an attempt to stop police seizing security camera footage from the property where she was found face down in her bath tub on the morning of January 31. The home in Roswell, Georgia, was owned by Bobbi's mother Whitney Houston at the time she died three years ago. Gordon, 25, who had been in a tempestuous relationship with her for several years and claimed to have married her, sought a temporary restraining order to prevent police acting on a search warrant involving a security camera. He had applied to Fulton County Superior Court to stop the company which owns the camera system -  Nest - from complying with the warrant, issued on February 12th. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Recorded: Footage from these cameras is now at the heart of a legal dispute. Nick Gordon is trying to stop police accessing them as they investigate suspicions of drugs at the property . Secured: CCTV cameras are present throughout the gated community. Nick Gordon has an account with the web-based . Loggerheads: Nick Gordon (left) is seen the only time he has been at hospital where Bobbi Kristina is being treated. He claims Bobby Brown (right) has banned him and that money lies at the root of the feud. Gordon holds a 'dropcam' account with California-based company Nest who operate security surveillance equipment. Today he dropped the case, just as it emerged in public. In a statement, his lawyers Joe Habachy and Randall Kessler said: 'To protect his client's interests, Mr Habachy filed the Temporary Restraining Order. 'However, Mr Gordon has since elected to dismiss the claim in an effort to help Roswell PD speed up their investigation.' However the court papers gave an unprecedented insight into the investigation by Roswell Police Department, confirming for the first time that they suspect drugs were on the property. The documents say 'there is an insufficient link between the crime alleged in the search warrant, specifically 'possession of a controlled substance.' The court papers state: 'A drop cam allows plug and play operation of security cameras and stores the data that it collects on ""cloud' servers so that the data may be accessed at any time anywhere from an internet connection after logging in to a secure site'. Court documents filed on his behalf said: 'The Search Warrant violates the Fourth Amendment in that it is overly broad and seeks private data without limitation. '(It) fails to narrowly limit the scope of the data sought by date or other characteristics.' It adds: 'Plaintiff, Nicholas Gordon, is a customer of Nest Labs, (which) owns and operates a 'dropcam' web-based security company. 'On February 12, 2015, Nest notified via email its customer, Nicholas Gordon …that it had received 'legal process' for data and documents related to the account and that it intended to comply.' Case: Nick Gordon (above) who has been photographed waving a hand gun in the air while driving, claims the police quest to access the camera system's records is a breach of his privacy . Gordon, who has been photographed with a hand gun, claims the police quest to access the camera is a breach of his privacy. Police are treating Bobbi's injuries and near drowning as a criminal investigation. But Gordon's claim says: 'Privacy, in the context of stored information includes the right to control how stored information is communicated and prevent its abuse. 'lt is more than just confidentiality of data. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution implicitly governs in its very core that Americans have a reasonable expectation of privacy which inherently extends to the right to control their own data and access thereto. Gordon's claim confirm for the first time that police suspect narcotics may have been illegally used on the night of January 30/31. Police have given little information about what they believed may have happened to Bobbi and the lead up to her emergency. Police spokeswoman Lisa Holland said:'The matter may or may not result in criminal charges being brought against individuals. 'This remains an active investigation and the Roswell Police has no further statement or information to release at this time.' Gordon's move to protect his privacy is another twist in what has become an increasingly hostile situation between him, Bobbi's father the singer Bobby Brown and members of Whitney's family. 'Grow up': Gordon uploaded a screenshot of text messages he allegedly sent to Bobby Brown. In them he insisted Bobbi Kristina will hate her father when she wakes up . Motivation: The 22-year-old claims the Brown family only want the money from Whitney Ho . Parenting: Gordon accused Bobby Brown of virtually deserting his daughter during the rant . Hope: Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend is still optimistic that she will wake up from the medically-induced coma she has been in  for the last three weeks . Gordon has been banned from visiting Bobbi's bedside at an Atlanta hospital unless he gives her family the full and unequivocal rundown on what Happened to her. He has been mouthing off in Twitter against his girlfriend's father questioning his standing as a parent and how much he actually saw and cared for her. The singer is said to be ' distraught beyond measure' over his daughters condition and praying for her to come out of her coma. Bobbi Kristina, the only daughter of the late Whitney Houston has been hospitalized in Atlanta since being found unresponsive on January 31 in a tub at her Georgia home. Police said Gordon was performing CPR when emergency responders arrived at the home. A new report which surfaced on Saturday claimed that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub. In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident, according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claimed, and still was 'distraught' over her mother's death three years ago. One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words'. She has been on life support ever since she was rushed to the hospital last month after being found by Gordon. Bobbi Kristina Brown, left, and Nick Gordon pictured in 2012. Gordon has been barred by her father, Bobbi Brown, from seeing her in hospital until he reveals what happened before she was found unconscious in a bathtub on January 31 . Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married. Last week, she was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection and given a tracheotomy. Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, the rapper and former member of New Edition, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition. Earlier this week Gordon used Twitter to claim Brown has hardly seen the 21-year-old in years before her accident and is only interested in the family's money. The 22-year-old told Bobby Brown to 'grow up' - insisting his daughter will hate him when she wakes up. The angry tirade came hours after attorneys from the Brown family told Gordon he will not be allowed at her bedside until he reveals exactly what happened the evening before she was found face down in a bathtub. Sign of affection: Nick Gordon tweeted this picture of an apparently new tattoo on his arm on Valentine's Day . Gordon also insisted he has taken care of her '24/7' since her mother died in 2012. On Monday, he first tweeted: 'Okay, so I'll probably get in trouble for this,' before uploading a screenshot of damning text messages he claimed to have sent Bobby Brown. The first, underneath a picture of the new Bobbi Kristina tattoo on his right arm, read: 'Man to man I love your daughter.' He added: 'I don't know why you won't let me see her. 'Grow up. Your daughter is going to hate you when she wakes up.' Gordon claimed: 'Bobby seen his daughter 4 times in the last 5 yrs' and added: 'Now him and his family want Whitneys $$ which belongs to Krissi or Cissy.'","Nick Gordon fought to stop police seizing footage from security cameras surrounding the Roswell, Georgia, property where girlfriend drowned .

"Kill the badgers: 'Any future Conservative government' would push ahead with 'a wider roll-out of the culls',  said Environment Secretary Liz Truss . Environment Secretary Liz Truss has promised to roll out controversial badger culls across Britain if the Tories win the election, calling bovine TB the 'greatest threat' to our food security. Addressing the National Farmers Union conference yesterday, she said 'any future Conservative government' would push ahead with 'a wider roll-out of the culls', which have been fiercely criticised by wildlife groups. Her comments came as NFU president Meurig Raymond said the incidence of TB had decreased on farms in two pilot areas in Somerset and Gloucestershire where culling of badgers has taken place over the last two years. He urged politicians not to make the controversial cull 'a party political issue' in the run-up to the general election, and criticised Labour for pledging to give up on culling. Ms Truss pledged that any future Conservative government would 'take the difficult decisions to deal with this disease'. She told the conference: 'It is shameful that under the previous government bovine TB increased nine-fold and we ended up with the highest levels of the disease in Europe. It is incredible that they would like to make the same mistake again.' She said the Government's strategy included cattle movement controls, vaccination in 'edge' areas around disease hotspots, and culling where the disease is rife. 'We will not let up, whatever complaints we get from protest groups. We're in it for the long haul. We will not walk away,' she said to the conference, to applause from farmers. Speaking to journalists after her speech, she said: 'I've been very clear we will continue with the 25-year strategy, and that does envisage a wider roll-out of the culls.' While she would not say when the roll-out could take place, Mr Raymond said there was 'no reason' why - if the Conservatives get back into power and the strategy was still on the table - other areas would not be ready to start culling this year. Mr Raymond told delegates at the NFU conference that in the two pilot areas TB incidence had already declined, adding that the reductions were 'not just by a small amount either - in the Somerset pilot area TB incidence on farms has decreased from 34 per cent to 11 per cent compared to two years ago'. And he said: 'In Gloucestershire, vets are also reporting a reduction in TB in cattle too. And just two days ago, one of our Gloucestershire members was given the fantastic news that his farm is now clear of TB, for the first time in 11 years. 'He is very clear that the only thing that's changed on his farm is that we are now doing something to control the disease in wildlife.' Backing: Her comments came as NFU president Meurig Raymond, right, said TB had decreased on farms in parts of Somerset and Gloucestershire where badger culls have taken place over the past two years . Mr Raymond also called for the next government to make food and farming a priority, in the face of a report which showed declining self-sufficiency of UK food production. Research from the NFU released ahead of the conference suggested the UK's self-sufficiency is in a 30-year downward spiral, with 60 per cent of food needs met with produce from farms here. At current rates, and with the UK population expected to grow to 70 million in 20 years, the figure could fall  to 53 per ent by the 2040s, the NFU claimed, warning it would have serious implications for the British economy, food security and employment. In his speech to the conference, Mr Raymond said that in 1984 the UK produced more than 80 per cent of what the country consumed. 'If you like to look at it this way, our national cupboard lasted us well into autumn. By 2013, the cupboard was bare by August 7. If we go on like this we will run out by mid-summer. 'Who would want to lead the country down a path where we produce less than half the food we eat? This will be totally unacceptable to the British public and in no way in the national interest.' Mr Raymond said polling for the NFU showed that 85 per cent of British people wanted to see supermarkets sell more British food, and nearly eight out of ten believed the Government should do more to ensure a secure and affordable supply of British food. He called for measures to protect farmers from market volatility, including by making sure the food chain worked fairly, better regulation on labelling, preventing 'Nimbys' using the planning system to stop poultry sheds being built or alternative energy projects going ahead, and to 'sort out the mess' of reform to the European Union subsidy system that attempted to make it 'greener'. On the run: The Tories say they would continue with their 25-year TB eradication strategy, which includes a roll-out of the badger cull . Anti-cull campaigners reacted angrily to Ms Truss's comments. Claire Bass, Humane Society International/UK's executive director, said: 'The badger cull has been a very expensive, cruel and ineffective farce and Liz Truss cuts an increasingly lonely figure in continuing to defend it.' She claimed that 'almost unanimous scientific opinion' described the cull as a failure. And she said: 'This cull fails our wildlife by subjecting badgers to inhumane shooting; it fails farmers by promising a solution to TB that simply doesn't work; and it fails the public by wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers' money. 'The rational, scientific and apolitical solution to bovine TB is happening right now in Wales: a combination of badger vaccination, improved farm biosecurity and stricter cattle movement measures. 'With the election just weeks away the Government has a short window of opportunity to reverse this disastrous strategy and win back some public trust in its countryside policies.' In Gloucestershire just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot, falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in TB in livestock, leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there. The Government claimed the low numbers in Gloucestershire reflected the 'challenges of extensive unlawful protest and intimidation' by anti-cull campaigners. In Somerset, where the other pilot cull has been carried out, a sufficient number of badgers were killed this year to lead to expected reductions in TB in cattle, with 341 culled, in a required range of 316 to 785. In both of the pilot areas, a significant proportion were killed by the more expensive cage trapping and shooting method, rather than 'controlled shooting' of free-running badgers. Ministers and farmers insist culling is necessary to tackle TB, which can be spread from badgers to livestock, with more than 26,000 cattle slaughtered in England last year and multimillion-pound losses. But opponents say badger-culling is inhumane and ineffective, and alternatives such as vaccination should be pursued. An independent expert panel concluded that controlled shooting of badgers in the first year of the cull was not effective or humane.","Liz Truss vowed to extend the scheme in speech to farmers' union .

"Headteacher Martyn Keane admitted common assault by beating  after he said he reprimanded a 10-year-old boy and 'made contact with his chest' A headteacher has admitted assaulting a 10-year-old pupil at a private primary school where fees cost more than £2,000 a term. Martyn Keane, 68, admitted a charge of assault by beating after he said he reprimanded the pupil at Gower House School in Kingsbury, London, and 'made contact with his chest.' Following the incident the local child protection officer, Met Police and Department for Education called for an emergency Ofsted inspection of the private school. Its measures for safeguarding children who report abuse were found to be inadequate. Keane, 68, denied claims that he had pulled the pupil's tie causing him to fall on the desk, but admitted he had made contact with the boy's chest. District Judge Denis Brennan told Willesden Magistrates' Court the allegations about Keane pulling the boy's tie could not be established. He sentenced the headteacher - who has since retired - on the basis of his admissions to an assault by beating charge. Keane, who is said to have retired from his position after court proceedings began, was given a six month conditional discharge for the offence. Willesden Magistrates' Court heard that police visited the private school after the boy complained to his mother. The court heard evidence from three child witnesses as well as the former headteacher during the case. Gower House School is a private school for children from the age of two to 11. Termly fees for children aged seven and over cost £2,260. The school was established in 1951 and on its website is described as 'a well established school known to be one of the best out of the many private schools in north London.' Keane admitted a charge of common assault by beating at a hearing at Willesden Magistrates' Court . An order was initially imposed under the Children and Young Person Act 1933 banning the publication of the name of the school, the victim and any child witnesses. This was partially lifted following an application by the Evening Standard, allowing the school and headteacher to be identified. Keane, of Berkhamstead, Hertfordshire, was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £15 and costs of £85.","Martyn Keane admitted assaulting a 10-year-old pupil at private school .

"Eric Masters, 28, has been accused of filming the rape of a toddler . A man has been accused of filming the rape of a toddler after tying her to a motel bed. Eric Devin Masters was alleged to have taken the 18-month-old to the room where he tied her to a bed and taped himself abusing the child. The 28-year-old has been charged with four counts of criminal sexual conduct in relation to the allegations at Motel 6 in June 2012, according to Michigan Live. The alleged assault was discovered when FBI agents were investigating Masters for a series of sex crimes throughout the state. An agent said one of the videos discovered on Master's computer showed the acts against the child by a man with the same tattoos found on Masters. The graphic details of the assault were included in a probable cause affidavit filed in Kent County District Court. Masters, from Grand Rapids, pleaded guilty at the town's U.S. District Court to multiple counts of sexual exploitation of a child and producing child pornography. The charges carry a sentence of between 15 years and life. Masters also awaits sentencing after pleaded no contest to third-degree criminal-sexual conduct with a 13-year-old in Muskegon County Circuit Court. Last year, Masters was sentenced to 36 days in jail and five years on probation after he pleaded no contest in Ionia County Circuit Court to second-degree criminal-sexual conduct, state police records showed. Masters will be tried in Kent County before Circuit Court Judge Mark Trusock in between hearings in federal court and Muskegon County, where he has been held for more than a year on a $250,000 bond, according to court records.","Eric Masters, 28, charged with four counts of criminal sexual conduct .

A mother-of-three who will become the first woman to be executed in Georgia in 70 years has been granted a few more days of life - thanks to the weather, despite her clemency being denied. Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, had been scheduled to receive the lethal injection at 7pm on Wednesday at the state prison in Jackson, but the execution has now been reset for Monday, according to a Department of Corrections statement. The department did not provide a reason, but a winter storm is forecast to hit parts of Georgia on Wednesday afternoon, closing schools and offices and prompting warnings about roads. Gissendaner, the only woman on death row in the state, was sentenced to death for plotting to have her husband Douglas murdered by her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, in suburban Atlanta in 1997. On Tuesday, she had appealed to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles for clemency. The board listened to a full day of testimony, including from 21 people who asked for her life to be spared. But on Wednesday morning, it announced her clemency plea had been denied and that she would be put to death as planned - making her the first woman to be executed in the state since 1945. Gissendaner's lawyers had argued that she should be spared because she has found God and 'accepts full responsibility' for her role in the killing. She has reconciled with two of her three children, CBS46 reported. In the clemency application, her daughter Kayla wrote: 'The impact of losing my mother would be devastating. I can't fathom losing another parent', 11Alive reported. Gissendaner herself added in the application: 'There are no excuses for what I did. I will never understand how I let myself fall into such evil.' Arrest: Gissendaner, who is Georgia's only female death row inmate, was arrested in 1997 for plotting to kill her husband with her then-boyfriend, Gregory Owen (right), who ultimately testified against her . Victim: Douglas Gissendaner was stabbed multiple times in the neck by his wife's lover in 1997. Kelly Gissendaner wanted to divorce him but thought he would not leave her alone so plotted his death . Family: The couple had three children together; two of the children have now reconciled with their mother . But her husband's family continued to favor the death penalty, 11Alive reported. She is being put to death even though she was not the one to murder her husband. Owen, who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner repeatedly in the neck, is serving life behind bars after testifying against Gissendaner. Still, authorities say she is responsible for the death. 'If it hadn't been for Kelly Gissendaner, Doug Gissendaner might still be alive,' Gwinnett District Attorney Danny Porter told WBS. 'He might have raised his children. He might have gone on. There are a lot of possibilities that were snuffed out in 1997 that she's responsible for.' Authorities said she had wanted to kill her husband - whom she had previously divorced and then re-married - because she wanted to split from him again but thought he would not leave her alone. Gissendaner and Owen plotted the murder for months and Owen followed her orders to kill Douglas while she was out at a nightclub with friends on February 7, 1997,CNN reported. Owen waited at the couple's home until Douglas arrived before kidnapping him and driving him to a remote area. He stole his watch and wallet to make the murder look like a robbery. He then beat Douglas across the head with a nightstick and stabbed him in the neck and back between eight and 10 times. In court: Gissendaner was found guilty of plotting the murder in 1998 (pictured) and sentenced to death . Locked up: Gissendaner, who will be the first woman to be executed in Georgia in 70 years, is seen eating a meal in her cell at Metro State Prison in Atlanta in 2004. She has requested a 2,400-calorie final meal . Kelly Gissendaner arrived as the murder took place but remained in her car. She later got out to make sure that her husband was dead before the pair took Douglas' vehicle and burned it using kerosene. The duo then left the scene. Detective Doug Davis, who was working on the case, told CBS46: 'He must have been deeply in love with this woman is all I can say.' Douglas' burned-out car was found the following morning, and more than a week later the body was found a mile away. Animals had eaten away at the skin on Douglas' neck, making it hard for authorities to deduce which stab wound had killed him, CNN reported. In the days before he was found, Kelly Gissendaner had appeared on local TV to appeal for help finding her husband - but she later admitted to police that she had been having an affair with Owen. Authorities interviewed him and on February 24, Owen confessed to the murder and implicated her. While in jail, she plotted to pay someone $10,000 to falsely claim that they had driven her to the murder scene at gunpoint, but her cellmate alerted authorities to the plan. Owen is serving life in prison in Washington state for his role in the murder. He avoided the death penalty after testifying against his former lover. She was sentenced to death in November 1998 after she was found guilty of her part in the death. Behind bars: Gissendaner is seen peering through the slot in her cell door as a guard brings her a cup of ice in 2004 at Metro State Prison in Atlanta. She will leave behind her three children when she is executed . Cuffed: She walks in handcuffs and with an escort of three CERT (Correctional Emergency Response Team) officers on her way to an activity therapy session at the prison in 2004 . Gissendaner, who is incarcerated at Arrendale State Prison, is the only woman among 84 inmates facing the death penalty in Georgia, according to a report by the state's Department of Corrections. She is set to be only the 14th woman executed in Georgia since 1735. The last time a woman was executed was in 1945. Lena Baker was electrocuted in March of that year after she was convicted of murder for shooting her boss. In 2005, the state pardoned her after agreeing with her family that she acted in self defense. Gissendaner has requested a last meal of cornbread with a side of buttermilk; two Burger King Whoppers with cheese; two large orders of fries; cherry vanilla ice cream; popcorn; a salad with boiled eggs, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese and Newman's Own buttermilk dressing; and lemonade, according to CBS46. A rough estimate shows that the food contains more than 4,200 calories. Under Georgia law, only three offenses are punishable by death - murder, rape and kidnapping. Pardoned: Lena Baker was pardoned in 2005 . Lena Baker was an African-American maid who was sentenced to death by electric chair in 1945 for murdering her boss, Ernest Knight, in 1944. In her trial, she explained that during an argument with Knight, he held her against her will and threatened to kill her if she tried to leave. She took his gun and fatally shot him before calling police and saying she had killed in self-defense. But she was found guilty of capital murder by the all-white jury and sentenced to death. She was put to death using several electric shocks on March 5, 1945. Her final words were: 'What I done, I did in self-defense, or I would have been killed myself. Where I was I could not overcome it. God has forgiven me. I have nothing against anyone. I picked cotton for Mr. Pritchett, and he has been good to me. I am ready to go. I am one in the number. I am ready to meet my God. I have a very strong conscience.' But in August 2005, Baker received a posthumous pardon from the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, which said that the 1945 decision to deny Lena Baker clemency was 'a grievous error'. It ruled that she should have instead been charged with voluntary manslaughter, which would hav allowed her to avoid the death sentence. In 2008, a movie, 'The Lena Baker Story', was released about her life.","Kelly Gissendaner was sentenced to death for making her boyfriend murder her husband Douglas in 1997 .

"A UK health worker pricked with a needle while treating Ebola sufferers in Sierra Leone has been flown to the UK and admitted to a London hospital for monitoring. Public Health England today confirmed the worker has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London for monitoring. A spokesman stressed the person has not been diagnosed with the deadly disease and do not have symptoms. It is also understood he or she is not in an isolation unit. The person is the fifth British healthcare worker to be flown back to the UK to be treated for the virus, which has killed more than 9,500 people. A fifth UK health worker has been flown back to England after being pricked with a needle while treating sufferers in Sierra Leone. Pictured is the Ebola virus under the miscroscope . British nurses Will Pooley and Pauline Cafferkey were flown back in August and December last year, a military healthworker was flown back in January 2015 and an aid worker was evacuated earlier this month. They were all treated at the Royal Free in London, the only hospital in the UK with an isolation unit which has two high-security containment beds. A Public Health England spokesperson today said: 'We can confirm that a UK healthcare worker, who has had potential contact with the Ebola virus while working in Sierra Leone, has been transported to the UK for assessment and monitoring. 'The individual has not been diagnosed with Ebola and does not currently have any symptoms. 'The person was working in the field treating people with Ebola and they basically pricked themself with a needle during that treatment. 'It's possible there's no virus in the needle - the monitoring is a precaution more than anything else.' The individual has been admitted to the the Royal Free Hospital in London for monitoring . He added: 'On arrival in the UK, the healthcare worker was transferred to the Royal Free Hospital for assessment. 'They will be monitored for any symptoms for the remainder of their incubation period, in line with standard procedures.' Both Will Pooley, Pauline Cafferkey and the military health worker flown back to the UK were treated at the Royal Free Hospital, in an isolated ward to stop the spread of infection. The Public Health England spokesperson said the health worker admitted today is not in an isolation unit. They said: 'When Pauline Cafferkey had Ebola - that's when you go into isolation. 'This person hasn't been diagnosed with Ebola - it wouldn't be the same level of risk, so I doubt it.' Professor Paul Cosford, PHE's director for health protection and medical director, added: 'The overall risk to the general public from Ebola remains very low. British nurses Pauline Cafferkey (left) and Will Pooley (right) were also treated at the Royal Free,  in a specialist isolation unit to protect against the spread of the disease . The individual is likely to have been exposed to the virus but has not been diagnosed with Ebola and does not have symptoms. Pictured is the High Secure Infectious Disease Unit at The Royal Free Hospital, London . 'We are confident all appropriate public health actions have been, and will continue to be, taken to support this individual and to protect the public's health. 'The courage shown by every volunteer, in helping those affected in West Africa and to prevent the spread of Ebola any wider, should be recognised.' As of the beginning of this month, there have been a total of 23, 539 cases of Ebola confirmed and 951 deaths since the outbreak began, according to figures from the World Health Organization and the U.S.’ Centers for Disease Control and Protection. The news comes after earlier this month an international team of scientists said it is 'very likely' that the Ebola virus will mutate to become an airborne virus, making it infinitely more deadly. They reviewed past studies examining past outbreaks of Ebola within human populations, as well as animal studies. Writing in the journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team noted research where healthy animals kept at a distance from infected ones died from the virus. However they acknowledged the primary form of transmission will be through contact with the bodily fluids of an Ebola patient.","UK health worker was pricked with a needle and flown back to England .

"A dodgy market trader has been caught selling perfume labelled as Chamele No 5. The seller was caught flogging the bottles of perfume – a knock-off of the famous Chanel No 5 perfume - for £10 at Surrey Street Market in Croydon, south London. The trader had marked up the 100ml bottles of perfume as being discounted from £96 - the price of a 100ml genuine bottle. The dodgy market trader was caught flogging the large bottles of Chamele No 5 perfume (pictured) – a knock-off of the famous Chanel No 5 perfume - for £10 a piece at Surrey Street Market in Croydon, south London . The fake perfume (left) is a knock-off of the best-selling Chanel No 5 Eau De Parfum which retails for about £96 for 100ml (right). The trader was flogging the illegitimate bottles in Chanel No 5 boxes, perhaps to trick buyers . However, the fake bottles of perfume came to light after an unhappy customer complained to a market inspector about the spelling error on the box. Police were called but the dealer managed to scarper before officers arrived on February 13. The bottles of perfume were described by Trading Standards chiefs as being 'very poor counterfeits' with bottles 'labelled Chamele No 5' and intertwined circles rather than 'back-to-back capital Cs', featured in the famous Chanel trademark. Chanel No 5 is the world's best-selling perfume, selling more than 10million bottles a year. Its iconic status was sealed in 1953 when Marilyn Monroe said that all she wore to bed was 'two drops of Chanel No 5'. Tony Newman, leader of Croydon Council, said: 'It's a shame this rogue chose to target Surrey Street for his criminal activities. 'Our historic market is the workplace of many good, decent traders, making an honest living, and they certainly don't want this sort of thing happening in their midst. 'It's a sad fact of life that there are people who are prepared to rip off others by producing vastly inferior goods and selling them as trusted brands at what appear to be bargain prices. The fake perfume was brought to the attention of market inspectors after an unhappy customer pointed out the spelling error on the perfume bottle's logo. Police were called but the dealer escaped before officers arrived . Police managed to confiscate some of the bottles of perfume being sold by the market trader on February 13 . 'In truth, the goods are anything but a bargain. 'The old saying that 'if it looks too good to be true, it very probably is' should always be borne in mind. 'The sensible thing to do is to not buy the goods, and report the matter to the police at the earliest opportunity. 'Early reporting increases the chance of the crook being caught, and stops him hoodwinking other shoppers who might not be quite as alert.' Taylor Harrison, 34, who lives in Croydon, said: 'Even Del Boy himself wouldn't make such a simple mistake. 'Chamele sounds more like the name of the guy's girlfriend rather than a world famous perfume.' The market, which runs from Monday to Saturday, has been around since 1276 when it was granted a market charter by the then Archbishop of Canterbury. The trader was caught flogging the perfume at Surrey Street Market in Croydon, south London (file picture) The global counterfeit market has reached unprecedented levels with fake goods accounting for nearly 10 per cent of worldwide trade, according to the World Customs Organisation. In December, a trainee accountant ended up court after being caught selling fake Rolex watches and DVDs online under the name of his alter ego Rodney Trotter. A covert sting operation was set up to catch Ryan Flood, after trading standards noticed his Facebook page - named after one of Only Fools and Horses' Trotter brothers - was selling dodgy goods. The 25-year-old was caught offering £150 worth of counterfeit goods including a Rolex watch for £20 and numerous DVDs. In December last year, several discount stores across Britain were found to have been unknowingly selling fake bottles of Head and Shoulders shampoo (pictured) , which contained some 'sex change' chemicals . In the same month, several discount stores across Britain were found to have been unknowingly selling fake bottles of Head and Shoulders shampoo, which contain potentially dangerous ingredients including 'sex change' chemicals. Thousands of counterfeit bottles of the top-selling haircare brand were seized by Trading Standards officers after customers began reporting side effects of itching and bleeding after using the products. Tests carried out by scientists at Loughborough University revealed the fakes had a 'significantly different chemical make-up to the genuine product'. An investigation found fake bottles of the leading shampoo brand had been on sale at two Trago Mills' stores in Cornwall and at a discount B&M store in Northern Ireland. Leanne Wertheim appeared in court in 2012 after being caught using four separate eBay accounts to sell £40,000 worth of fake cosmetics – including copies of Max Factor, Bobbi Brown and Benefit (pictured above) Trading Standards officers said they were 'extremely good counterfeits' and said the discount stores could not be blamed for not realising they were fake goods. In 2012, Leanne Wertheim used four separate eBay accounts to sell £40,000 worth of fake products – including copies of Max Factor and Bobbi Brown – to unsuspecting customers. The 24-year-old, from south Wales, sold the fake goods despite them containing three times the legal amount of lead, which can cause brain damage. She boasted the cosmetics were from high-end companies such as MAC, Benefit and Lancome, but they were in fact life-like counterfeits.","Trader caught selling bottle of knock-off perfumes called Chamele No 5 .

"A disabled mother claimed today she was ‘humiliated’ after being stopped from boarding a bus when the driver asked her to prove how much her wheelchair weighed. Samantha Hemes, 22, was waiting for the service in Hereford with her 11-month-old daughter Amelia Rose and mother Christine Bonsall, 48, on Saturday afternoon. But she was left in tears after the driver of a number 74 bus that pulled up allegedly refused to allow her on the vehicle unless she could prove her wheelchair weighed below 300kg (660lbs). Left in tears: Samantha Hemes (right), 22, was waiting for the service in Hereford with her 11-month-old daughter Amelia Rose (left) and mother Christine Bonsall (centre), 48, on Saturday afternoon . Miss Hemes claimed she removed the child seat adaptor from the chair but the First bus driver still banned her from boarding - and eventually drove off, leaving them all by the roadside. The mother, who suffers from dystonia - a condition which causes muscle spasms and contractions - said the ordeal was the first time she had suffered such an incident. She added: ‘My mum was trying to get the ramp down so I could get on the bus and the driver wouldn’t help. Then he said he thought I was too heavy and needed a certificate to prove I wasn’t. ‘I was really embarrassed and humiliated. I was mortified by his attitude. I didn’t want to cry and normally don’t cry that easily - but it was really embarrassing in front of lots of people. ‘After that, another driver came to help me and made sure I got on the next bus. He is still working as I’ve seen him driving around, but I want something done so it does not happen again. Banned from the bus: The family had been waiting for the 2.12pm First service (file picture) from a Tesco store in Hereford back to their home in the Newton Farm area of the city when the incident occurred . ‘I want an apology at the very least. I have been left feeling very humiliated and it has put me off catching buses in future.’ Miss Hemes suffers from dystonia, a condition which causes muscle spasms and contractions . The family had been waiting for the 2.12pm service from a Tesco store in Hereford back to their home in the Newton Farm area of the city when the incident occurred. West Mercia Police is investigating the incident, and has urged any witnesses to get in touch. Karen Pardoe, 40, who saw the incident while shopping in the city, said: ‘You can’t treat somebody like he did. I have been sat here looking at the conditions of carriage on the bus. ‘There’s nothing in the policy stating that it has to be of a certain weight or anything. I would rather not use the bus if that’s how someone was allowed to talk to me.’ A First Bus spokesman said the firm was undertaking a ‘full investigation’ into the circumstances - and apologised to Miss Hemes. He said: ‘From the information provided so far, it seems that our driver at the time of the incident did not deliver anywhere near the standard of customer service or assistance that we would expect from our staff. ‘I can assure the lady concerned that we are taking this matter very seriously. In response to the accusation of discrimination against wheelchair users, this is absolutely not correct. ‘We do not discriminate against anyone using our buses. We have manual ramps fitted that should be opened and closed by the driver to allow easy access for wheelchairs onto the bus. ‘This incident was obviously upsetting to the lady concerned at the time and we would like to apologise for the insensitivity and unprofessional approach allegedly given by the driver at the time.’ A West Mercia Police spokesman said: ‘We were made aware of this incident. 'We were called at 5pm on February 21 to a complaint that a woman had been denied boarding a bus due to the speculation of the weight of her wheelchair. ‘Police later visited the woman involved and established that no further police investigation is required, and the bus company will be dealing with this independently.’","Samantha Hemes was waiting for bus service with mother and daughter .

"Purina Beneful dog food has caused the illness and possibly the death of thousands of dogs, a new class-action lawsuit filed earlier this month has claimed. The lawsuit contends the dog food, a Nestlé Purina PetCare Co. product, has dangerous toxins, including propylene glycol and mycotoxins. Nastle Purina officials say the lawsuit is 'without merit' and based on 'social media-driven misinformation.' Purina Beneful is still being sold on store shelves. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Beneful dog food, made by Nestle Purina, is being sued for allegedly causing dogs to get sick . The lawsuit was first filed by Frank Lucido in a US District Court in California. Lucido says three of his family dogs became ill after eating exclusively Beneful for a period of time. Dozer, an eight-year-old English Bulldog, suffered internal bleeding in his stomach and lesions in his liver and died, he says. According to the suit, Lucido's two other dogs also became ill after eating Beneful. He said he fed them only Beneful for less than a month. The lawsuit says thousands of dogs have suffered internal bleeding, liver and kidney failure, vomiting and other symptoms. This class action suit concerns 'kibble' dry food, which includes 'Purina Beneful Health Weight'; 'Purina Beneful Original'; 'Purina Beneful Incredibites,' and 'Purina Beneful Healthy Growth for Puppies', 'Purina Beneful Healthy Smile', 'Purina Beneful Health Fiesta', 'Purina Beneful Healthy Raidance', and 'Purina Beneful Playful Life' varieties. Harmful? Propylene glycol, a substance the suit says is toxic to cats and dogs, may be included in Beneful’s ingredients list because it helps retain the food’s moisture . The lawsuit lists stomach and related internal bleeding, liver malfunction or failure, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, seizures, bloat and kidney failure as symptoms consistently reported by dog-owners feeding their dogs Beneful. Lucido claims these illnesses, and similar illnesses of other dogs that have become sick and/or died after eating Beneful, were caused by toxic substances found in the food. 'We received hundreds of complaints,' said attorney James Young, of lawfirm Morgan & Morgan out of Tampa, Florida - one of the lawyers filing the suit. 'Nationally, there have been thousands of complaints about dogs who have eaten this dog food by Purina Beneful and suffered very serious side effects, including death.' 'The issues are pretty similar across the board,' he said, 'liver and kidney problems, which results in diarrhea, bloody stool, vomiting, and secondary harm.' Specifically, the suit claims that automotive antifreeze component propylene glycol is a primary ingredient in Beneful's dog food. Defensive: The company responded to the claims, stating that the suit is 'without merit' and that there are 'no product quality problems with Beneful' (stock picture) The lawsuit is asking that Nestlé Purina Petcare Company pay actual, statutory and punitive damages to all those filed under the class action suit -- as well as forfeit any profits earned from the sale of the product in question. The St. Louis Business Journal talked to Nestlé Purina PetCare. 'We believe the lawsuit is without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against it,' Keith Schopp, vice president of corporate public relations, said. 'Like other pet foods, Beneful is occasionally the subject of social media-driven misinformation.' 'We have a very comprehensive quality assurance program to ensure the quality of our products.' Beneful has been the target of two other class action lawsuits, both of which, Schopp said, were quickly dismissed.","The lawsuit lists internal bleeding, liver malfunction or failure, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, seizures and kidney failure as symptoms .

"Colombian police have seized $90million worth of cocaine bound for Mexico during a raid against a major drug gang operating out of the country's jungle region. The 3.3tonnes of drugs are believed to belong to the Colombian Usuga Clan crime gang, which is based in the rural area of Unguia in Choco, which borders Panama. General Rodolfo Palomino, the head of Colombia's national police, told reporters  the shipment was poised to leave the country either via a Caribbean river or the Panama border when it was stopped. Colombian police have seized $90million worth of cocaine bound for Mexico during a raid against a major drug gang operating out of the country's jungle region . The 3.3tonnes of drugs are believed to belong to the Colombian Usuga Clan crime gang, which is based in the rural area of Unguia in Choco, which borders Panama . Colombia, a major cocaine producer, turns out some 300 tonnes annually, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime . The packages were allegedly due to leave the country via a Caribbean river or the Panama border . He said: 'The shipment was ready to leave on a river to the Caribbean or the border with Panama, to be sent on to Mexico.' Colombia, a major cocaine producer, turns out some 300 tonnes annually, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Authorities confiscated about 166 tonnes of the drug in 2014. The northeastern area of Colombia is strategically important for crime gangs and leftist guerrillas who use it for clandestine trafficking of arms and drugs. The Usuga Clan, which has at least 2,000 members, is the country's largest criminal group. The anti-drugs officers stand with other agents as they inspect the packages of cocaine . The discovery took place on Monday. The drugs are currently being inspected at Necocli police base . General Rodolfo Palomino, the head of Colombia's national police, spoke to reporters about the find . In addition to drug trafficking, it is also involved in illegal mining. Colombian authorities have offered a $600,000 reward for information leading to the capture of its leader. Many crime gangs are comprised of ex-members of paramilitary groups who officially demobilised nearly a decade ago. Marxist rebels also reap hefty profits. Cocaine and other drugs are some of the principal sources of financing for groups fighting in the country's 50-year armed conflict, which has killed over 200,000 people. Just last week, police discovered three tonnes of cocaine in the port terminal in Cartagena, a popular tourist hub on Colombia's Caribbean coast. The drugs were also bound for Mexico. He said the shipment was worth around $90million and was poised to leave the country when it was stopped . The officers opened a package of the drug to show to reporters at the press conference about the seizure .","The 3.3tonnes are believed to belong to Colombian Usaga Clan crime gang .

"A man in Providence, Rhode Island got the fright of a lifetime this week when he went to use his friend's bathroom and the restroom exploded. Neurosurgeon Jeffrey Oppenheim of New York was visiting his friend Andrew Pessin on Sunday when he went to use the first floor bathroom just 10 minutes after arriving. Oppenheim says he heard a strange clicking noise - like a pilot light igniting - in the lavatory just second before a mysterious combustive force through him out of the room and into the kitchen. Scroll down for video . What happened? A man in Providence, Rhode Island was injured this weekend when a blast ripped through his friend's bathroom . Rattling: Jeffrey Oppenheim (pictured) was visiting his friend Andrew Pessin in Rhode Island when he went to use the bathroom and it exploded . Strange noise: Oppenheim recalls hearing a clicking noise just before the explosion on Sunday . 'It happened in an instant like getting hit by a cannon,' Oppenheim told WLNE. His friend Pessin was sitting down in the kitchen with his three sons when he caught wind of a burning smell and immediately carried his children to safety and called 911. 'Oh it was horrible they were petrified screaming standing in the snow screaming, barefoot,' Pessin said of his 9, 7, and 5-year-old sons. Oppenheim told Daily Mail Online that it's believed a gas leak sparked the blast. Authorities allegedly told his friend that gas may have leaked in from outside the house, and that it can lose it's rotten egg odor (caused by added mercaptan) if it passes up through the ground. Mystery: Authorities are still investigating the cause of the mysterious blast. Workers for gas company National Grid were seen looking around the house on Sunday . Safe and sound: Besides bruising to Oppenheim's leg, no one else was injured in the incident . Everyone got out of the house safely, though Oppenheim did suffer a bruised knee in the blast. 'I'm just very grateful it was me in there and not one of the Pessin children who are little. They could have gotten killed,' Oppenheim said . 'I'm very, very, very lucky,' Oppenheim told Daily Mail Online, adding that he was able to drive back to New York that very day and didn't need to take a break from performing surgery. Authorities continue to investigate the cause of the blast, which remains a mystery. Reporters on the scene on Sunday said workers from gas company National Grid were surveying the house. Unfortunately, the Pessin family is facing the possibility that the house could be condemned, according to Oppenheim. He says they have been staying in a hotel, and have signed a lease on an apartment in the meantime.","Authorities are still trying to figure out what caused the explosion in a Providence, Rhode Island home on Sunday ."
"Princess Beatrice is set to follow in sister Eugenie's footsteps and has temporarily relocated to the US, the Duchess of York has revealed. The 26-year-old princess, who is thought to have already arrived in the US, will study for a qualification in finance during her stay. In a statement, a spokesman for the Duchess said: 'Princess Beatrice started a finance course in the US this week' but refused to confirm which institution the royal is studying at. Scroll down for video . Following in her sister's footsteps: Princess Beatrice has relocated to the US to study finance . The news, which was first reported in Hello! magazine, means both of Prince Andrew's daughters are now living in the US, even if, for at least one of them, it isn't permanent. Princess Eugenie has been based in New York since 2013 after taking a job with online auction house, Paddle8. Beatrice, meanwhile, has remained in London since leaving university and has had a succession of jobs since, most notably an internship at Sony Pictures. That, however, resulted in embarrassment for the princess after she was drawn into the Sony hacking scandal and had details of her salary splashed across the internet. Sister act: The pair now both reside in the US and it is not known when either will return to the UK . Glamorous: Eugenie, who moved to New York in 2013, has become increasingly polished during her stay . Company: The pair will have no shortage of opportunities to meet up now both are in the same country . Other roles taken up since leaving university include a job at Cabot Square Capital, a company headquartered close to London's Marble Arch, and a series of patronages. Although Beatrice receives no money from the Civil List and is entirely funded by herself and her parents, she has also undertaken engagements on behalf of the Queen. Like Eugenie, she is also a regular sight at the big set-piece royal engagements, among them Trooping the Colour and Royal Ascot. The princess won't, however, be forced to rely only on her sister during her stay in the US.

"Ed Miliband today challenged David Cameron to back a ban on MPs having lucrative second jobs to 'restore the reputation' of the Commons in the wake of the cash for access scandal. Ahead of a vote tonight, the Labour leader told the PM: 'You can vote for two jobs or you can vote for one.' But Mr Cameron has defended the right of MPs to do second jobs - insisting that extra work can be fitted in alongside constituency duties. Scroll down for list . Ed Miliband today challenged David Cameron to back a ban on MPs having lucrative second jobs . A fresh row over second jobs erupted this week after revelations former foreign secretaries Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Jack Straw were filed by undercover reporters boasting about how they could be hired for £5,000-a-day. Sir Malcolm announced he was suspended from the Tory party and forced quit as an MP after bragging that he could see any foreign ambassador in London and has 'useful access' to every British ambassador in the world. Mr Straw was suspended by the Labour party after being filmed boasting about having laws changed 'under the radar'. Commons Speaker John Bercow warned: 'People should not be in Parliament to add to their personal fortune.' Labour is using a debate in the Commons tonight to force a vote on the issue, calling for a ban on MPs from holding directorships and consultancies. The Labour leader recalled comments by Mr Cameron in 2009 when he said in opposition that 'being a Member of Parliament must be a full-time commitment . Mr Cameron claimed that it would still allow an MP to work as a paid trade union official. But Mr Miliband hit back: 'Let's agree now we will rule out anyone being a paid trade union official, a paid director, or a paid consultant. 'Say yes and we can restore the reputation of this House. 'We will insert paid trade union official and you have the chance, and all of your MPs tonight in the lobby, this is a very big test. 'You can vote for two jobs or you can vote for one. I'll be voting for one job. What will you be voting for?' The Labour leader recalled comments by Mr Cameron in 2009 when he said in opposition that 'being a Member of Parliament must be a full-time commitment. The public deserve nothing less ... double-jobbing MPs won't get a look-in when I am in charge'. Mr Miliband said: 'What's changed?' Mr Cameron replied: 'I think the difficulty with your specific proposal is it would allow, for instance, someone to be a paid trade union official but it wouldn't allow someone to run a family business or a family shop. 'Like many of your proposals, it is not thought through, it's whipped up very quickly, if you thought it was such a good idea, why didn't you put it in place four years ago?' Filmed: Former Conservative Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, pictured, told undercover reporters that he had a usual fee of between £5,000 to £8,000 for a half-day's work for representing private companies . The Prime Minister said there was 'fundamentally a disagreement' between the two leaders, claiming he was the only one who believed Parliament benefited from having MPs with different experiences in the Commons. 'I make an offer to you: no more support from trade unions for the Labour Party and then we have got a deal.' Mr Cameron pointed out that he spent more time on his duties as PM than on work linked to his seat in Witney, Oxfordshire. 'We have practising doctors in this House, we have practising dentists, we have people who take part serving our country in Afghanistan or Iraq and we do have people who run family businesses or have other interests,' the Tory leader said. 'What you want is a Parliament where people can come and share their experience and make some points instead of just having a whole lot of trade union-sponsored ciphers.' Mr Cameron added: 'I think the most important thing we can do - and I certainly don't rule out further changes - but the most important thing is to make sure we apply the rules. 'Paid lobbying banned. Non-declaration of interests banned. Making sure wrongdoing is investigated and punished. We are not making no change - we have just passed a lobbying Act and we have just passed a recall Act so people can sack their MP.'","Party leaders clash on curbing outside interests of members of parliament .

"The decorative teapot, made from Paris porcelein, is to be put on sale for the first time in 213 years . It would have been enough to make Admiral Lord Nelson choke on his tea. A decorative teapot Nelson used at the height of the Napoleonic Wars unaware it was actually French porcelain has emerged for sale for the first time in 213 years. The 6ins high piece was part of a service known as the 'Baltic tea set' presented to the great naval hero to mark his victory at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1802. The blank chinaware set was decorated with oak leaves, acorns and an anchor in a London workshop in a rush so it could be used at a banquet held in Nelson's honour. The service was gifted to Nelson afterwards and ended up at Merton Place in Surrey, the palatial home Nelson shared with his mistress, Lady Emma Hamilton. Following his death in 1805 at the Battle of Trafalgar, where Nelson led the Royal Navy to victory against the combined French and Spanish fleet, the set was listed on an inventory of Emma's possessions at Merton. It was later passed onto Nelson's brother, William, and his wife, Hilare Barlow, Dowager Countess Nelson, Duchess of Bronte, and then by descent to the present owner, who is remaining anonymous. It was only after the teapot was put up for auction with an estimate of £20,000 that experts were able to examine it and found the porcelain was actually made in Paris. It was imported to Britain and is likely to have been surplus stock available to the chinaware decorators in London at the time. Admiral Horatio Nelson would not have known the teapot, which was part of the 'Baltic tea set', was French . Experts say Nelson would not have been aware it was French. Fergus Gambon, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'Nelson wouldn't have had a clue as to what porcelain the set was made from. 'In the early 19th century, when this teapot made, a lot of white porcelain from Paris was imported to the UK where it would have been decorated. 'The workshops of London probably didn't have an idea if they were painting French or English porcelain. 'The shapes of French porcelain items compared to English porcelain are often different. This teapot is distinctly French. You can tell by its tall, cylinder shape and sloping shoulders.' The teapot first surfaced on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow last year after its owner took it along. John Sandon, the expert who inspected the teapot on the Roadshow, said: 'The ladies of London clubbed together to give to Nelson chinaware when he attended a banquet with the Lord Mayor. 'It is slightly confusing when you look at the teapot because it isn't a British teapot at all, it is French. Merton Place in Surrey, the palatial home Nelson shared with his mistress, Lady Emma Hamilton . 'Nelson was out there fighting the enemy yet here is a teapot of French porcelain. 'Nelson shared his home with Emma and while he was away at sea one can imagine her being there and entertaining with the very fine china that Nelson had been given. 'When he died there was an inventory made of all the contents at Merton and there were two services listed. 'One was the Baltic service. It is exciting to think of Emma pouring tea for Nelson out of this teapot.' Nelson perished at the the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . The 'Baltic Set' was a tea service and a dessert set both of Paris porcelain, together with a dinner set believed to be creamware. The teapot carries the inscription 'Nelson 2nd April Baltic', the handle and spout flanked by further gilding of '15th Febry', 'San Joseph', and 'Glorious 1st August'. Nelson's niece, Charlotte Nelson, accompanied her uncle at the banquet in London. She said at the time: 'I wish you could have seen all the people jumping up to the carriage to see my uncle and thousands of people round him looking up at him. 'All the ladies had their handkerchiefs out of the windows when my uncle passed, they and the people calling out ""Nelson for Ever.""' Following William Nelson's death in 1835, Hilare married for the third time to George Knight, the nephew of Jane Austen. When she died in 1857, this teapot passed to her niece, Florence Catherine Elizabeth Barlow, and then to her daughter, Colin Joyce who bequeathed it to her cousin, Hilare Margaret Barlow, who is mother of the present owner. The teapot is being sold by Bonhams on April 1.","Paris-made piece, 6ins high, is to go on sale for the first time in 213 years .

"50 Shades of Grey is making pain more popular than ever, meaning the ultimate agonising activity Tough Mudder has upped the ante for 2015. ‘Tough Mudder 2015 Redefined’ promises mud, sweat and tears like never before, thanks to the radical inclusion of tear gas. The team have introduced eight new adrenaline-inducing obstacles to their military-style course in the ultimate test of participants’ physical strength and mental grit. Seven other obstacles have also been revamped, including the notorious ‘electric shock’ mud crawl; each more terrifying and exhilarating than before. 'Cry baby': One of the eight new adrenaline-inducing obstacles include the 'cry baby' where participants are forced to with endure a crawl around obstacles whilst being subjected to tear-gas type substance . Ring of fire: Mudders are forced to climb up a 25-foot scaffold structure, latch onto a fireman’s pole and plummet through a giant ring of fire and into an awaiting tank of water . Mud Mile 2.0: The Mud Mile has been updated to be even more intense than the traditional obstacle. In Mud Mile 2.0 participants face waist-deep mud, double-high entrance and exit mounds and completely vertical mud masses . 'We’ve ramped up everything ten times more this year,’ said a Tough Mudder spokesperson. The challenge is a team-oriented 18 to 20 kilometre course. More than 50 events will be held across the globe this year. ‘Cry Baby’ is one of the extreme new challenges which brave participants must face. ‘While whining has never been tolerated on course, an exception might have to be made for this never-before-seen tearjerker of an obstacle,’ advise the Tough Mudder crew. Dead ringer: This challenge requires impeccable upper body strength and hand-eye coordination or you WILL fall! Mudders must sideways climb along a series of ascending and descending pegs using heavy-duty rings . The teams will crawl through an enclosed space filled with a safe tear gas-like substance, while dodging hazards along the way . In 'Kiss of Mud' participants must keep their head down whilst sliding into deep trenches and crawling over hay bales to avoid the barbed wire above them . The teams will crawl through an enclosed space filled with a safe tear gas-like substance, dodging hazards along the way. Another exciting addition is ‘Shawshanked’ which, as the name suggests, took its inspiration from the film Shawshank Redemption. Specifically, it is a recreation of Andy Dufresne’s thrilling yet unpleasant escape from prison through a sewage pipe. The obstacle requires that participants crawl through an inclined, mud-infested tube, ending with a backwards drop into a water pit. The team have introduced eight new adrenaline-inducing obstacles to their military-style course to test participants’ physical strength and mental strength . In 'Meat Slab' participants must swing like Tarzan, hopping across a near-vertical 50-foot-long wall by swinging from one rope to the next .

"It has been long admired that cats can always land on their feet but this one feline has the added benefit of an extra six toes to keep her steady. Natasha, the ginger tabby, was a stray on the streets of New York before she was adopted at the age of nine by Shirley Belwood and the pair emigrated to Wimborne in Dorset ten years ago. The cat has a rare condition which left her with oversized paws and 24 toes - six more than the average feline. Natasha, the ginger tabby, has a rare condition which means she has oversized paws and six extra toes . But Natasha, who is now 19 and spent a year looking after herself on the Upper West Side, has seven toes on both front paws - two more than normal - and five on her hind paws instead of four. Ms Belwood, who has two other cats, said the extra digits has made her clumsier than most cats. 'If you give her certain toys, she can't play with them properly,' she said. 'It's so funny, she looks so awkward because she just can't grab them. 'I heard her crying for ages outside my apartment window in New York and I just had to find her. 'She's got a lot of attitude and she's quite the character but we're so close. She doesn't do as much these days as she has diabetes, but she's still so frisky and cranky - a typical New Yorker. 'The nurses at the vets say she ""swears a lot"" at them whenever she goes. That just shows what she's like.' Natasha was adopted by Shirley Belwood ten years ago and the pair emigrated from New York to Dorset . Ms Belwood added that she gets on with her other two cats but Natasha prefers a quieter life. 'She does like to keep herself to herself, she's an older lady now and likes peace and quiet,' she said. The world record for the cat with the most toes is currently held by a Canadian cat named Tiger who has an impressive 27. Some polydactyl cats have problems with joint growth, the forming of legs and nail beds and extra thick claws fusing together. They are sometimes referred to as 'Hemingway cats' because author Ernest Hemingway became a famous fan of them after being given a six-toed cat by a ship's captain. Kittens Fred (left) and Ned (right) are polydactyl cats with 54 digits between them. Fred has 10 more than a usual cat and Ned has eight extra toes . Cats born with more than the average number of toes have the congenital physical anomaly known as polydactyl - a dominant genetic trait. The word is Greek in origin, with 'poly' meaning 'many' and 'daktylos' meaning 'digits'. Normal cats have a total of 18 toes, with five toes on each front paw and four toes on each hind paw but polydactyl cats can have as many as eight digits on their front and hind paws. The condition seems to be most commonly found in cats along the east coast of North America and in South West England, Wales and Kingston-upon-Hull. Polydactyl cats were popular with Nobel Prize-winning writer Ernest Hemingway, who collected more than 50 after he was given his first cat named Snowball by a ship's captain. After his death in 1961 his Florida home was turned into a museum and home for his cats. It is because of his love of the animal that they are fondly referred to as 'Hemingway Cats'. They are also referred to as 'mitten cats' because the extra digits on their front paws can make it seem as though they are wearing mittens. Polydactylism is a condition that can also affect humans and dogs.","Tabby Natasha was a stray on streets of New York when she was rescued .

"These two young men are the only living cases in the world with an extremely rare disorder and they  happen to be related to each other. Teenage brothers Thomas and Bradley Farrell both suffer from Arts Syndrome - a genetic condition that has effected their hearing, sight and muscle tone basically since birth. The boys, aged 17 and 18 respectively, have spent their lives in and out of Sydney hospitals with various complications related to their condition, which went undiagnosed until 2001. Scroll down for video . Teenage brothers Thomas and Bradley Farrell both suffer from Arts Syndrome - a genetic condition that has effected their hearing, sight and muscle tone basically since birth . When Bradley was diagnosed as being deaf at 12 months of age, his mother Sharon was already pregnant with Thomas and the family were told there was a one in four chance of having another deaf child. Thomas was diagnosed at five months. But despite having two boys who were deaf, Ms Farrell told Daily Mail Australia there was no reason for the family to be concerned at that point. 'Bradley and Thomas looked like normal young boys,' she said. It wasn't until after they both got cochlear implants in 1999 that they realised something might be wrong. The boys, aged 17 and 18 respectively, have spent their lives in and out of Sydney hospitals with various complications related to their condition, which went undiagnosed until 2001 . The brothers, pictured with cricketer Steve Waugh and his wife, are members of the Steve Waugh Foundation, which helps raise awareness of rare diseases . Bradley and Thomas have battled serious infections over the years in relation to their syndrome. They still use a breathing machine today to help them get by . 'After they got the implants they had to go to hospital. Both Bradley and Thomas had influenza. When they took the tubes from Bradley, they didn't think he would pull through. 'Then every six months they were in hospital with respiratory problems.' It took nine years from when they first started testing their DNA and blood for the team at Westmead Children's Hospital to diagnose the boys with Arts Syndrome. The specific gene related to their condition was only found in 2007. They still use a breathing machine today to help them get by and they are highly susceptible to infection. The brothers have very limited vision and have been confined to wheelchairs for the past several years due to muscle weakness. 'There’s no cure and that’s just the way it is,' Ms Farrell said. It took nine years from when they first started testing their DNA and blood for the team at Westmead Children's Hospital to diagnose the boys with Arts Syndrome . Bradley (left at his year 12 formal) and Thomas (right at City2Surf) are both deaf, have limited vision and muscle tone as a result of Arts Syndrome . Their mother Sharon was told Bradley was deaf when he was 12 months old and Thomas was diagnosed at five months of age - but she had no reason to worry at that stage . 'Lots of young people who have rare disorders are still waiting to find out what they have. There’s millions of genes. It’s like a needle in a haystack. We were very lucky to find out what it was. 'If we can keep them healthy and happy, that’s my main objective. We just want to give them a good quality of life.' The life expectancy for Arts Syndrome, which primarily effects boys, is five years of age. 'They had already surpassed the life expectancy when we were told (about the gene),' Ms Farrell said. 'Every time we make a visit to the hospital… the doctors don’t know and we certainly don’t know what to expect. 'We go in with one complaint and there’s something else that’s happening at the same time. We go in hoping it’s only a short stay but sometimes it can be longer.' While there is no treatment for the genetic condition, the boys have been taken a drug treatment called SAM for the past six years to help with complications associated with the syndrome. 'They haven’t been in intensive care as respiratory patients for a number of years, which is wonderful,' Ms Farrell said.

The life expectancy for Arts Syndrome, which primarily effects boys, is five years of age. Thomas (pictured) and Bradley had already passed that when they were diagnosed . Problems associated with the syndrome started from birth, but Ms Farrell said it was hard to pick up because Bradley and Thomas looked like normal young boys . Their mother is primary carer for Bradley and Thomas, with help from their 21-year-old sister Nancy. 'They can’t dress themselves or feed themselves, but they have electric wheelchairs that's given them good independence around the house,' she said. 'When they were smaller we could lift them out of the bathtub, but we've had to make modifications. The boys were getting longer and heavier, so putting them in a shower chair makes life a lot easier.' Former Australian cricketer Steve Waugh made a big impact on the Farrell family when his rare disease foundation first stepped in to provide ongoing support six years ago. The Steve Waugh Foundation, which helps raise awareness of rare diseases, provided the funds to modify the Farrell's bathroom to suit Bradley and Thomas' needs.

'Every time we seem to need help, there always seems to be support somewhere. You don’t know where it comes from. Sometimes it’s the most unlikely places like the Steve Waugh Foundation,' Ms Farrell said. 'We could be members of a hundred different organisations but they only concentrate on certain things. The Steve Waugh Foundation looks at (rare diseases) as a whole unit and how they can help the individual to make their life better.' Bradley and Thomas are set to meet Steve on Wednesday at an event he organised at Sydney's Taronga Zoo for 32 people with rare diseases and their families. Rare Disease Day on Saturday marks 10 years since the Steve Waugh Foundation started raising awareness of the two million Australians who suffer from a rare disease. 'Bradley and Thomas never fail to inspire me with their incredible inner strength and spirit of goodwill,' Steve said. 'They light up the room with their cheeky smiles and sense of humour and have a gift for relaxing anyone who is in their company. Without realising it, they are both role models for all of us with their amazingly positive attitude.'

Powering through: Daniels was born with amniotic band syndrome, a fetal condition which causes thin strands of tissue to constrict the growth of limbs . Indeed, her Instagram account carries the playful motto: 'Who needs two arms?' She started dance lessons at the age of three and her favorite styles include ballet, hip hop and modern. She's also a member of her school's cheerleading team. The teenager added: 'When people say I can't do something it just gives me more motivation to prove them wrong. 'Dance is my passion, and I am not going to give up on something just because of the way I was born.' Daniels typically spends up to five hours after school practicing her dance moves and often competes in competitions on weekends. One of dreams includes starring on the TV show America’s Got Talent. Daniels' father Rick previously told The Columbus Dispatch that he 'fights off tears' every time he watches her perform. He concluded: 'Obviously, she’s my daughter.

"She purrs and meows like any normal cat. But she doesn't make any mess and her detachable fur can even be put in the washing machine. The JustoCat has been developed by academics in Sweden to offer comfort, pleasure and peace of mind to people suffering with dementia. While she may look like a cuddly toy, the inventors insist she is much more like a medical device and, as such, she comes with a hefty price tag of around £1,000. Companion: The JustoCat has been developed by academics in Sweden to offer comfort, pleasure and peace of mind to people suffering with dementia - basically the benefits of a pet without the mess . Help: While she may look like a cuddly toy, the inventors insist she is much more like a medical device - hence the price tag of around £1,000 . The technology is the result of a partnership between health care researchers at Mälardalen University in Sweden and robotics experts at the Robotdalen company. The creator, Professor Lars Asplund, said she is now being released for sale across Europe and her benefits are so great that she might even be prescribed by doctors. The professor in computer science said the project started with a study of people with dementia and involved trials and interviews with carers. He said: ‘The care-givers used JustoCat as a tool for relaxation, to calm down the patient with dementia and as a distraction to help deal with agitation that might disturb other patients. ‘The cat encourages and stimulates communication, she allows the patients to recall memories of their own cats and distracts repetitive behaviour.’ The professor said: ‘The functions of JustoCat means it resembles a live cat in many ways in that it breathes, purrs and meows. 'One advantage with the cat's fur is that it is washable and above all is removable and thus can meet hygiene requirements in an institution.’ The robotic cat is about the same size and weight as a normal cat, and comes in grey or black and white, however it doesn’t move beyond the impression it is breathing. Professor Asplund said: ‘JustoCat can provide peace, be soothing and be a tool for increased interaction and communication. ‘It is a complement in the care of people with dementia and in the care of people with intellectual disabilities. Tests and research demonstrates positive results from the users, as well as patients and care-givers. ‘The goal of JustoCat is to enrich the daily lives of people with dementia. It can provide increased psychological, physical and social well-being.’ Importantly, he said the cat also provides some respite to nurses and carers because dementia suffers who take to her are generally calmer and easy to communicate with. He defended the high cost saying: ‘This is not a toy. You can buy a toy much cheaper, but it will not have the same effect. It is classified as a class one medical device class and therefore a doctor can prescribe it. It is hygienic, a toy is not.’ The robotic cat is already available in several countries in Europe and the company is planning to meet a potential British distributor this week. The development is the latest evidence as to how robotics will increasingly be used in the future to provide practical help in the home as well as psychological support, particularly to the elderly. British academics recently revealed their part in the development of the Care-O-bot 3, which is both a home help and a friend to older people who may be ill, or feel trapped and alone at home. Benefit: JustoCat resembles a live cat in many ways in that it breathes, purrs and meows. One advantage with the cat's fur is that it is washable and removable - so can meet hygiene requirements in an institution' The JustoCat also provides some respite to nurses and carers because dementia suffers who use her are generally calmer, it is claimed . The robot is the result of a collaboration between British and European academics under the umbrella of ACCOMPANY - Acceptable Robotics Companions for Ageing Years. The hope is that it will help older people to stay in their homes and live an independent life, rather than being moved miles away from friends and family into an expensive care home. The team, which is co-ordinated by Dr Farshid Amirabdollahian, (correct) of the University of Hertfordshire, have combined a robot ‘butler’ and software from a range of experts to deliver Care-O-bot 3. Importantly, the machine does far more than fetching and carrying, for it has been programmed to be a friend, providing emotional support to someone living alone. It will suggest activities to motivate people who otherwise might spend their day, parked in a chair in front of a TV, never speaking to anyone – and it will call for help if they are in trouble. The LCD screen offers images of a face that is smiling and happy when a task has been successful and will look downcast or sad when there is a problem, such as the user forgetting to take their medication. It will also provide the social interaction, someone to talk to, that will help people stave off loneliness and depression.","The JustoCat has been developed by academics in Sweden .

"Snout-nosed crocodiles with jaws strong enough to crush clam shells ruled the swampy wetlands that covered Peru 13 million years ago. Palaeontologists have discovered the remains of seven different species of crocodile and cayman, including three new species, in the area around the modern Amazon river. The fossils were found in the Pebas district of northern Peru. The new species of caymen Gnatusuchus pebasensis (shown in the reconstruction above) had a short but wide jaw that was powerful enough to crush clams and other shell fish. It used its snout to dig in the mud . One of the new species, named Gnatusuchus pebasensis, had blunt, peg-like teeth and used its broad snout to dig shellfish from the muddy swamp floor. It grew up to 5.2ft (1.6 metres) in length and had just 11 teeth. Most cayman, which are related to alligators, tend to have around 20 teeth. Prehistoric crocodiles escaped the jaws of predatory dinosaurs by running like dogs, according to a study published last year. The findings explain  how the reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world. While  most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish, their ancestors ran around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean, imitating the behaviour of whales. The study, by Bristol University, revealed how the jaws of the ancient crocodiles evolved to enable the fierce animals to survive in vastly different environments. The team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the Mesozoic - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years. The study revealed that ancient crocodiles invaded the Jurassic seas and evolved jaws built primarily for water efficiency to capture agile prey, such as fish. After the devastating extinction that ended the Triassic period, crocodile ancestors invaded the seas and evolved jaws primarily built to efficiently swim in the water to catch agile prey such as fish. They also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the Cretaceous Period - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs, including eating plants. Instead, the fossil record points towards novel adaptations in other areas of their anatomy, such as armadillo-like body armour. Another blunt nosed crocodile was named Kuttanacaiman iquitosensis, which means 'grinding or crushing machine'. The scientists estimate it grew up to 6.2ft (1.9 metres) in length. However, these new species were dwarved by two other previously known species of giant cayman whose fossils were also found nearby. Purussaurus neivensis and Mourasuchus atopus are thought to have grown up to 39ft (12 metres) in length and were more generalised predators. The researchers say that it is highly unusual to have found a habitat that had so many species of cayman living alongside each other. There are six cayman species that live in the whole of the Amazon basin today, but only three are ever found in the same area and they rarely share the same habitat. The large number of cayman found in Pebas has been described by the researchers leading the excavation as 'hyperdiverse'. Dr Rodolfo Salas Gismondi, from the University of Montpelier in France, said the huge wetland habitat that covered the area led to an explosion in the number of crocodile species. He said: 'We have uncovered this special momen in time when the ancient mega-wetaland ecosystem reached its peak in size and complexity, just before its demise and the start of the modern Amazon River system. 'At this moment, most known cayman groups co-existed. 'Ancient lineages bearing unusual blunt snouts and globular teeth along with those more generalised feeders representing the beginning of what was to come.' The fossils may now help scientists unravel the evolutionary origins of cayman that live in the Amazon basin. They describe the discovery in a paper published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Scientists found fossilised remains of seven ancient caymen species in Pebas, northern Peru, shown above . The fossilised skulls shown above belong to the three new snout nosed caymen species Gnatusuchus pebasensis (a) Kuttanacaiman iquitosensis (b) and the much larger Caiman wannlangstoni (c) The Gnatusuchus pebasensis name is derived from 'Natu', which is Quechua for 'small nose', along with the name of the village where it was found, Pebas, and the Greek for crocodile - Souchos. The animal, which is new to science, is thought to have used its snout as a shovel in to search for shellfish in the muddy depths of the swamps. Dr Salas Gismondi said: 'When we analysed Gnatusuchus bones and realised that it was probably a head-burrowing and shovelling caiman preying on mollusks living in muddy river and swamp bottoms, we knew it was a milestone for understanding proto-Amazonian wetland feeding dynamics.' The scientists also describe a third new species of prehistoric caymen called Caiman wannlangstoni, which they estimate grew up to 7ft (2.2 metres) long. It is thought to have resembled the broad-snouted caymen that lives in fresh water marshes and swamps thought out central and eastern south America. Caiman wannlangstoni, one of the new species, resembled the broad snouted caymen pictured above .","Scientists discovered seven species of caymen in Pebas, northern Perus .

"A horse given a second chance when he was rescued from an abattoir has won a point-to-point race just 18 months later. Oscar Flyer was saved by Valerie and Keith Welton, of Cattal, West Yorkshire, who paid just £300 for the injured steed - and were given £10 back for good luck. The ex-hurdler, which formerly trained with Tim Vaughan, was coached back to health by their son Sam Welton, 25, and his 32-year-old partner Carolyn Woods.

The horse is pictured with proud owner Valerie Welton (left) and jockey Sam Welton (right) Coached back to health: Oscar Flyer (left) was given a second chance when he was rescued from an abattoir . And almost two years after he last competed, Oscar Flyer made a superb comeback and claimed the top spot at the South Durham Farmers three-mile point-to-point race on Sunday. After dedicating the last 12 months to training him, Sam Welton rode Oscar Flyer to victory himself and the pair claimed the £150 prize money, recording the fastest time of the day. He said: ‘It was my partner Carolyn who spotted Oscar Flyer for sale, but when she called me and suggested buying him I wasn’t too keen - he had a bad tendon injury. ‘We never expected this to happen. It is a feat in itself for a horse who has been off for two years to compete at all – we were hoping he would just make it all the way round. ‘I actually thought he was a bit of a cowardly horse but he proved not to be - he was really tough that day and battled it out to the line. He was brilliant.’ Fastest time of the day: Sam Welton rode Oscar Flyer to victory and the pair claimed the £150 prize money . Winner: Mr Welton said that following the victory he wanted to have the horse racing again in about a month . In the stable: Oscar Flyer was put into a horse sale in Exeter, Devon, after suffering a bad leg injury. He was bought by a local slaughterman and destined to be put down after failing to sell . Oscar Flyer was put into a horse sale in Exeter, Devon, after suffering a bad leg injury. He was bought by a local slaughterman and destined to be put down after failing to sell. But Miss Woods, who was at the sale, saw potential in the then six-year-old and thought he deserved a second chance - before her partner’s parents offered to pay for him. Mr Welton and Miss Woods moved Oscar Flyer to their home in West Yorkshire and he spent a year recovering in a field before starting road work and training in September 2014. Mr Welton said: ‘We always intended for him to race if his legs would hold out. But he would never have been destined for the same fate we saved him from. 'After this win we are hoping to have him racing again in about a month. We would definitely love to do the same with other horses in the future.’","Valerie and Keith Welton of West Yorkshire paid £300 to save Oscar Flyer .

"Support: The Friends of Hinchingbrooke . Shocking new evidence has emerged that the first privately run NHS hospital was the victim of a seriously flawed inspection by the health watchdog, containing more than 200 errors. A damning report by the Care Quality Commission last month rated Hinchingbrooke, in Cambridgeshire, ‘inadequate’ and gave it the lowest ever score for patient care. The hospital has now been placed in special measures and Circle, the private firm that had been running it, has pulled out of its contract. At the time, there were suspicions that the CQC’s rating was influenced by Labour party activists and trade union members who opposed the involvement of private firms in the NHS. And last night new information came to light showing the report contained at least 215 errors. These included inaccurate figures on A&E waiting times, staffing levels, cancer care, medical blunders, falls and bedsores. All had been overstated or exaggerated and implied that the standards of care and overall performance was far worse than in reality. The watchdog claimed there had been 102 ‘serious’ blunders by staff last year when actually there were only 42. And while the report suggested nurses were routinely sedating patients ‘inappropriately’, the CQC has since admitted that only one patient had been given low-dose sedative drugs overnight and this was with the family’s consent, as he was ‘distressed’. The watchdog also claimed there were ‘higher’ than average levels of bedsores and urinary infections. The watchdog has since admitted that actually there is a ‘low incidence’ of such cases. The evidence is contained in a letter written by Circle’s chief executive, Steve Melton, to MPs on the Public Accounts Committee, who are carrying out their own investigation into the hospital. Circle claims there were 288 ‘factual inaccuracies’ in the report. The watchdog has accepted 215 of these, but refused to change its overall rating for the hospital. In his letter, Mr Melton said the CQC has refused to provide evidence to back up many of its claims, which included allegations that patients were told to soil themselves or pinched by nurses. He also said the report used ‘inflammatory language’, claiming that patients were being treated in an ‘emotionally abusive manner’. There are concerns that the errors were deliberately inserted by ‘politically motivated’ individuals anxious to scupper the private contract. Last month, it emerged that inspector Dr Nigel Sturrock was a member of campaign group Keep Our NHS Public. A doctor suspected of influencing the report’s criticism of children’s services in the A&E unit is the Labour candidate to be the area’s MP. And the lead inspector, Dr Jonathan Fielden, was previously a senior member of the BMA, the doctors’ trade union, who had warned of the dangers of privatisation – and he had never carried out an inspection. The CQC has since changed its policy to ensure inspectors declare links to organisations which may influence their judgement. David Campbell Bannerman, Tory MEP for the Eastern Region Counties, said: ‘We need an inquiry into this. I think it’s a Labour stitch-up.’ The hospital will now be placed back in the hands of NHS officials. A spokesman for the CQC said the watchdog ‘stands by’ its inspection report. The CQC has admitted its inspection report contained 215 errors. Here are some of the most striking: . The report claimed Hinchingbrooke missed the four-hour A&E waiting time target in two weeks out of a 13-week period, but Circle said it was odd to pick this ‘arbitrary’ period when the hospital was among the best at hitting the target in the country over the whole year. The CQC criticised the hospital for not having enough qualified staff in A&E to ensure children were looked after safely. But staffing levels were within the limits set out by the NHS watchdog NICE and the Royal College of Nursing. The watchdog stated there had been 102 ‘Serious Incidents’ – blunders by staff – last year when there had only been 42. It said the hospital had a ‘high incidence’ of patient falls resulting in harm. The watchdog now says the number of such falls is below the national average. The CQC claimed there were higher than average levels of bedsores and urinary infections, which can be a result of neglect. It has now admitted that there is a ‘low incidence’ of such cases.","Damning report last month rated Hinchingbrooke hospital as 'inadequate'

"Health conscious coffee lovers who order skinny milk may not be getting what they ask for as a survey reveals more than half of cafes serve up low fat instead to customers. Australia's capital has long been reported to have more cafes and restaurants per capita than anywhere else in the country but it seems that Canberra's caffeine crowd is not always getting exactly what they order. Although it may sound like semantics, low fat milk in fact contains almost two grams more fat than skim milk in a small cappuccino, while there is more than two grams of fat in a small latte which is made with low fat milk compared to the skinny variety. Only 43 per cent of cafes in Canberra use skim milk while 57 per cent admit to using low fat milk instead . Low fat milk contains almost two grams more fat than skim milk in a small cappuccino . A survey of 30 cafes in Canberra conducted by the LiveLighter campaign has revealed that 'skinny' is not a standard industry term. Only 43 per cent of cafes in Canberra use skim milk in a 'skinny' beverage while 57 per cent admit to using low fat milk instead. And as many as 37 per cent of coffee shops surveyed don't make skim milk available to their customers. Some small changes you can make to your coffee order to help maintain a healthy weight: . Dietitian Nerida Volker, said the way coffee is consumed was a factor when thinking about watching your weight. 'While coffee itself is not is not high in kilojoules or fat, the way we drink it often is and people don't always consider their beverages in their daily nutrition intake,' she said. 'If you drink a large latte made from full cream milk it could contain 1,100 kilojoules and 13 grams of fat. 'If you consume two or three a day it could contribute to an expanding waistline.' A large latte with low fat milk has four more grams of fat than one with skim milk while a large skinny cappuccino has 3.5 grams less than a low fat version. ACT Heart Foundation CEO Tony Stubbs said it's all about making small changes to your lifestyle maintaining a healthy weight. 'When you eat or drink more kilojoules than you need to, fat doesn't just build up around your waist. Toxic fat can build up around your vital organs, increasing your risk of heart disease,' he said. But don't give up your beloved coffee just yet - it's all about being smart in the way you order. 'So choose a good quality coffee, make it small and ask for low fat or skim milk. And importantly take the time to sit down and enjoy it,' Ms Volker said. More than two grams of fat is in a small latte which is made with low fat milk compared to the skinny variety .

"The remains of a baby woolly rhinoceros, which still has its fleece, has been discovered in the ice of Siberia. Named Sasha, the extinct creature - which must be at least 10,000 years old and is the first juvenile woolly rhino to be found - was well preserved by permafrost and experts are hopeful of extracting its DNA. A local hunter found the infant woolly rhino in a ravine by a stream in Russia's largest and coldest region, the Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia, in September. Scroll down for video . As if he was sleeping: The remains of a baby woolly rhinoceros, (pictured) who has been named Sasha and still has its wool, has been discovered in the ice of Siberia. It is the first juvenile of the species to be found . Initially, he thought the carcass was a reindeer, until he saw the horn growths and realised he had made the historic discovery of the world's first baby woolly rhino. ‘The age of the calf when it died has yet to be established, but scientists estimate it to be about 18 months old,’ The Siberian Times reported. ‘Precise tests will be conducted to ascertain when Sasha died, with the results likely in six months. ‘The creature's wool is well preserved, and an ear, one eye, its nostrils, and mouth are clearly visible. The age of the calf when it died has yet to be established, but scientists estimate it to be about 18 months old. The animal's lower half is missing as it was sticking out of the permafrost and was eaten by wild animals . A local hunter found the infant woolly rhino in a ravine by a stream in Russia's largest and coldest region, the Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia, in September. The region and its capital city is shown . Ancient beast:Based on skeletons and cave paintings, scientists believe that adult woolly rhinos (illustrated) were up to 13ft (4 metres) long . The woolly rhinoceros is an extinct species of rhinoceros that was common throughout Europe and northern Asia during the Pleistocene epoch and survived the last glacial period. The last of the species is thought to have died out around 10,000 years ago. In the Pleistocene epoch, the woolly rhino roamed across Europe and Asia from Scotland and Spain in the west, to South Korea in the east. It was well adapted to its environment, with stocky limbs and a thick woolly fleece to suit the icy tundra. Previous studies using DNA from the ancient creatures have found that its closest modern relative is the Sumatran rhino. Based on skeletons and cave paintings, scientists believe that adult woolly rhinos were up to 13ft (4metres) long and weighed as much as 4,400lbs (2,000kg). The two horns on the skull were made of keratin - the longest being 24 inches (61cm) - and the woolly rhinoceros used them for defensive purposes and to attract mates, but spent most of its time grazing on grasses. The reason for their extinction around 10,000 years ago is not fully understood, but like woolly mammoths, they may have been over-hunted by early man and affected by the receding Ice Age and the spread of disease. ‘The remnants of two horns were found on the carcass.’ Albert Protopopov, Head of the Mammoth Fauna Department, of the Sakha Republic Academy of Science, said: ‘The find is absolutely unique. ‘We can count a number of adult woolly rhinos found around the world on fingers of one hand. A baby rhino was never found before. ‘There was only one case in the 21st century when we found a frozen carcass of a grown up woolly rhino in Yakutia. It was in 2007 in Kolyma. ‘In the 20th century there were carcasses of woolly mammoths found in Verkhoyansky and Vilyuisky districts, but they were mummified and therefore not usable for studies.’ The animal's wool is well preserved, and an ear, one eye, its nostrils, and mouth are clearly visible (pictured). Albert Protopopov, of the Sakha Republic Academy of Science, said: 'We can count a number of adult woolly rhinos found around the world on fingers of one hand. A baby rhino was never found before' In the Pleistocene epoch the woolly rhino roamed across Europe and Asia from Scotland and Spain in the west, to South Korea in the east. A stock image is shown. The reason for their extinction around 10,000 years ago is not fully understood, but like woolly mammoths, they may have been over-hunted by early man and affected by the receding Ice Age and the spread of disease . Until now, scientists had no evidence of baby woolly rhinos, but now they have a skull and head, soft tissues and well preserved teeth to learn more about the prehistoric animal.  Here, the baby rhino's foot and leg is shown. Scientists hope to extract DNA from the remains . Previous studies using DNA from the ancient creatures have found that its closest modern relative is the Sumatran rhino (pictured) He added: ‘Even to find a skull of a baby rhino is very lucky indeed. ‘The possible explanation to it is that rhinos bred very slowly. Mothers protected baby rhinos really well, so that cases of successful attacks on them were extremely rare and the mortality rate was very low.’ Woolly rhinos are less studied than mammoths. Dr Protopopov said: ‘We are hoping Sasha the rhino will give us a lot of answers to questions of how they grew and developed, what conditions they lived in, and which of the modern day animals is the closest to them. ‘We know nothing about baby rhinos, while the morphology of adults is better known.’ ‘So far we didn't have a chance to work even with a tooth of a baby rhino, and now we have the whole skull, the head, soft tissues, and well preserved teeth.’ Scientists will first try to extract DNA from the remains, which was kept frozen to increase the chances of this being possible. They hope to get results in a ‘week or two’. The calf’s remains weigh 132lbs (60kg) and were found by Alexander Banderov, a hunter and businessman from Abyysky district. ‘There was only one case in the 21st century when we found a frozen carcass of a grown up woolly rhino in Yakutia. It was in 2007 in Kolyma,' said Dr Protopopov. An image of Kolyma's frozen body is shown . It was named after him - Russians use Sasha as a short name for Alexander. Mr Banderov and his friend Semen Ivanov were sailing past a ravine and noticed hair ‘hanging on top of it’. He explained: ‘At first we thought it was a reindeer's carcass, but after it thawed and fell down we saw a horn on its upper jaw and realised it must be a rhino. ‘The part of the carcass that stuck out of the ice was eaten by wild animals, but the rest of it was inside the permafrost and preserved well. ‘We immediately got in touch with Mammoth Fauna Department of the Yakutian Academy of Sciences.’ In the Pleistocene epoch the woolly rhino roamed across Europe and Asia from Scotland and Spain in the west, to South Korea in the east.

"The widow of 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle today posted a touching tribute to her slain husband as she praised the jury for finding his killer guilty. 'God Bless the Jury And good people of Stephenville, Texas!!' Taya Kyle wrote on Facebook on Wednesday morning, just hours after the jury found Eddie Ray Routh guilty of murder. 'Chris, you are the love of my life. You live on in my heart. You always will. I hope we all live lives that make you proud. And babe, Rest assured you don't need a fancy resting place - you live on... Safe In the hearts you left behind.' Taya had not been in the court for the guilty verdict on Tuesday evening; she had stormed out of the courtroom and slammed the door as the defense gave their closing arguments, according to Fox. Scroll down for video . Loved: Taya Kyle, pictured with her husband Chris, paid tribute to him in an emotional Facebook post on Wednesday morning, just hours after a Texas jury found his killer guilty of murder . Tribute: She also shared this image to Facebook, writing: 'What a poetic morning when the snow is melting and the winter is thawing out promising a new day' before praising the jury in Stephenville, Texas . The Facebook post is the first time she has spoken publicly about the jury's decision. Routh, 27, was emotionless as the jury read their verdict on Tuesday night: that he had not been insane when he opened fire on Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield in February 2013. They had taken him to a shooting range to help him settle back into society after he left the Marines. After the verdict, Littlefield's brother-in-law, Jerry Richardson, turned to Routh and said: 'You took the lives of two heroes, men that tried to be a friend to you. You became an American disgrace.' As the Littlefield family also spoke out on the Today show on Wednesday morning, jurors stepped forward to say they had 'no doubt' that Routh knew what he was doing at the time of the murders. The verdict came as interest in Kyle's career as the U.S. military's deadliest-ever sniper reached fever pitch thanks to Oscar-nominated film about his life, 'American Sniper'. Heartbroken: The strain showed on Taya's face ahead of the guilty verdict on Tuesday evening . Guilty: Eddie Ray Routh, 27, was convicted of capital murder by a jury in Texas after just two hours of deliberations on Tuesday evening and has been sentenced to life in prison without parole . Ahead of the trial, Routh's lawyers had argued that the popularity of the movie, which grossed $300 million at the box office, would mean he could not get a fair trial. And speaking on Good Morning America on Wednesday, the jurors admitted some of them had seen the movie - but insisted they had put that out of their minds when making their decision. 'It gave me a better outlook on Chris' role as a Marine,' one of the jurors, Barrett Hutchinson, said. 'But as far as the actions that took place on February 2, Chad was still in the picture and Chad was not in that movie. 'I took the fact that Chris was a marine out of my mind and looked at him as a person, looked at Chad as a person, looked at Eddie as a person and, you know, tried to make reasonable judgment.' Also on Wednesday, Chad Littlefield's family spoke out about the verdict. 'It was an answered prayer,' Judy Littlefield told the Today show. 'We've waited a long time to hear that. We feel justice has been served.' Relief: The parents of victim Chad Littlefield, Judy and Don Littlefield, pictured right, and his brother-in-law Jerry Richardson, left, said the guilty verdict for his killer 'was an answered prayer' Beloved: Chad Littlefield, pictured above left and right, was not a veteran but was committed to helping them when they returned from overseas, his parents said. He was shot dead by Routh in February 2013 . Routh's brother-in-law added that he never once believed Routh had been insane. Routh's attorneys had tried to prove he was in a psychotic state at the time of the killings. 'It was all an act,' Jerry Richardson said. 'I taught him in high school and... that's just the way he was. He never grew up. He was still just opposite defiant, and he had nothing wrong in the mind except for the drug use.' Chad's father Don remembered his son as a 'quiet man' and 'a good listener' who met Kyle at their children's soccer practices. The two men shared an interest in working out and helping veterans, Don said. Chad himself was not a veteran but wanted to help others. 'Chris served overseas and Chad served when they came back,' Mrs Littlefield explained. Mr Littlefield added: 'His motto was pass it forward.' Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, testified in the trial but has not spoken out since the verdict. She was seen in the courtroom on Tuesday but did not return when the decision was read. Fair trial? Jury members also spoke out on Wednesday and said they had 'no doubt' Routh was guilty - but they also admitted that some of them had seen the 'American Sniper' movie ahead of the trial . Chris Kyle's brother and parents were seen hugging and crying inside the courtroom after the verdict, but they did not issue a statement. As prosecutors decided not to pursue the death penalty, the only possible sentence for Routh was life in prison - with no chance of parole. Kyle and Littlefield had taken Routh to the shooting range at Rough Creek Lodge and Resort on February 2, 2013, after Routh's mother asked Kyle to help her troubled son. Family members say Routh suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder from serving in Iraq and in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. Defense attorneys noted that Kyle had described Routh as 'straight-up nuts' in a text message to Littlefield as they drove to the luxury resort and asked Littlefield to watch his back. While at the shooting range, Routh first opened fire on Littlefield, then turned on Kyle, whom he shot six times. He later said he was 'riled up' because Littlefield wasn't joining in with the shooting, then murdered Kyle too because he knew he would kill him. Psychiatrists for the defense also claimed Routh believed the men were human-pig hybrids who were going to assassinate him. Families: Deby Kyle, Chris Kyle's mother (right) is seen leaving the courtroom after the verdict, alongside Judy and Don Littlefield (left), whose son Chris was killed at the same time . After shooting the men dead, he fled in Kyle's pickup truck, drove to see family members and even stopped at Taco Bell. He was eventually arrested after a police chase and later confessed to the crime on video, which was played to the jury. Among evidence entered by prosecutors was a recorded phone call between Routh and a reporter  in which Routh said he was annoyed Littlefield wasn't shooting. 'Are you gonna shoot? Are you gonna shoot? It's a shooting sport. You shoot,' Routh said in the phone call. 'That's what got me all riled up.' Routh's friends and family testified that his behavior in the weeks before the shootings was increasingly erratic and that 'he did not seem all there' after gunning down the two men. Routh, who served with the Marines in Iraq and Haiti, had been admitted to Veterans Affairs hospitals on multiple occasions after his service to treat mental illness. They said he was unable to care for himself, acted as if he believed that someone was going to hurt him and thought that the government was listening to him. Caught: Routh is pictured in the back of a police car after he fled the scene of the murder in Kyle's truck before he was eventually caught. He claimed he shot the two men because he feared they would kill him . This pistol, found in Kyle's truck, which Routh fled in, matched bullet fragments found in Littlefield's body . Confession: Routh, pictured hours after the killings, confessed to the shootings almost immediately . 'It was clear that he was psychotic,' Mitchell H. Dunn, a forensic psychiatrist for the defense, told the court on Thursday. 'There was no question about that.' But the jury rejected the claim after prosecutors contended Routh knew what he was doing and acted deliberately when he shot the two and then fled. They said any bizarre behavior was the result of Routh's reliance on marijuana. He had smoked the drug with his uncle the morning before the shootings. A prosecution expert, Dr. Michael Arambula, said Routh's actions do not meet the legal definition of insanity under state criminal law. 'Any time intoxication is present, the game is over,' Arambula testified. See below for video .

"The mother of a nine-month-old girl was left baffled when her daughter's day care provider sent a note home complaining that her baby was playing roughly with other children and then smiling about it. The handwritten letter was given to the mother, identified only as Vero, on February 13. It was later shared on a social media group for working mothers before being picked up by the parenting blog Babble. Babble writer and working mom Alice Gomstyn called out the author of the note for chastising the infant for being aggressive with her friends, and then demanding of her mother to do something to stop her roughhousing. Complaint: This handwritten note was given to the mother, identified only as Vero, on February 13, chastising her infant Samantha for being aggressive and rough with her friends. According to the controversial missive, Vero's 9-month-old daughter named Samantha 'has been playing roughly and aggressively’ with the other babies in the group. The author of the note goes on to say that after sowing mischief around her and leaving her friends upset and in tears, little Samantha 'is smiling and enjoying herself.' Samantha also was apparently not impressed when workers at the day care center told her in their 'firm voices' that it was not acceptable to hurt others and gave her a time out. Instead of learning her lesson, according to the note, the naughty 9-month-old broke into a smile and went 'right back' to the play area. The letter concludes with a plea to the child's parents asking them to help change her behavior. 'Can you help us out by maybe discouraging her to not play roughly with her friends and her dog [?]' According to Gomstyn's blog post about the letter, Samantha's mother was angered by the day care's suggestion that her daughter was somehow consciously drawing pleasure from hurting others. Dr Adelle Cadieux, a psychologist at Helen DeVos Children’s Hospitals in Grand Rapids, Michigan, told Gomstyn that children Samantha's age go through a phase where they are excited to see the effects their actions cause, and they cannot yet recognize that what they are doing maybe be hurtful to others. Research also shows that it is normal for children between the ages of 6-8 months to begin behaving in an aggressive manner because they are eager to express themselves but are not yet verbal. The child development expert noted that telling a mother her baby's is being aggressive is at the very least unhelpful because as far as advice goes, it is too vague. ‘Saying, “I’m concerned about your child because I’m observing something different,” is a great way to begin a conversation as opposed to, “Hey, your kid’s being aggressive and you need to do something about it,”’ she said.","Note was sent to a mother named Vero complaining about her daughter Samantha's behavior .
